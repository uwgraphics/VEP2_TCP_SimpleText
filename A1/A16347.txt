QVecunque scripta sunt. ad nostram doctrina^ scripta su^t vt per pacienciam et
co^solacionem scripturarum spem habeamus ad roma^os. xv. These ben the words
of the great doctor and holy apostel saint poule. consyderyng that the
ghostly living of all true Christian creatures in this world stant specially in
hope of the bliss and the life that is to come in another world / And for as
much as two things pryncypally nouryshen and strengthen this hope in man /
that is pacyence in heart and ensample of virtues and good living of holy men
wreton in books and souereynly the words and the deeds written of our lord
Jhesu Criste very god and man for the time of his bodily living here in
earth. Therefore to strength us and conforte us in his hope speaks the apostle
the words forsayde to this entente. saying / that all things that been written
generally in holy church. and specially of our lord Jhesu criste. They ben
wreton to our lore that by pacyence and comfort of holy scryptures we have
hope / that is to say of the life and bless that is to come in another world
/ Here to according speaks saint Austyne thus. Goddissone / took mankind.
and in him he suffryd that longyd to man. and was made medecyne of man / and
this medicyne is so mykel that it may not be thought. For there is no pride.
but that it may be heled thorugh the mekenes of gods sone. There is no
couetise but that it may be heled thorugh his pouerte. No wrath but that it may
be heled thorugh his patience / No malice but that hit may be heled thorugh
his charity / And more over there is no sin of wickedness but that it shall
want hit and be kept fro hit. the which beholds inwardly. And loves and
follows the words and the deeds of that man. in whom gods sone yaaf him
self to us in to ensample of good living. wherefore now both men and wymmen
and every age and every dygnyte of this world is styred to hope of everlasting
life:

And for this hope and to this entente with holy writ Also ben wreton diverse
books and tretes of devout men. not oonly to clerks in latin. but also in
english to lewd men and wymmen. and hem that been of simple understanding.
Among the which ben wreton deuonte meditacyons of Crystes life. more plainly
in certain parties than is expressyd in the Gospel of the four Euangelystes
And as hit is said the devout man and worthy Clerk Bonauenture wrote hem to
a relygyous woman in laten. the which scripture and writing for the fructuous
matere thereof stering specially for the love of Jhesu Christ. and also for the
plain sentence to comyne understanding seems a monge other souereynly
edyfyenge to simple creatures. The which as children have need to be fed
with milk of light doctrine and not with sad mete of great clergy and o^
high contemplacyon. wherefore at the Instance and prayer of sum devout souls
to edyfycacyon of such men or wymmen is this drawing out of the forsayde
book of Crystes life wreton in englyssh with more put to in certain parties.
and also wythdrawynge of diverse auctorytees and matters. as it seems to the
writer Bernard ad (...) them(...)
hereof most spedeful and edyfyeng to hem that been of simple understanding. To
the which simple souls as saint Bernard says. comtemplacion of the manhede
of Christ is more liking more spedefull and more syker than is high
contemplaco^n of the godhede / And therefore to hem is pryncypally to be set
in mind the image of Crystes Incarnacyon. Passion. and Resurrecco^n. so that
asymple soul can not think but bodies and bodyly things. may have somewhat
according to his affection. wherwyth he may find and styre his devotion.
Nota pro (...) intellectu hum^^ liber


wherefore hit is to understand at the beginning as for a pryncypalle and
general rule of diverse ymagynacyons / that folowen after in this book that
the descryuyng of speches or deeds of god in heaven and angellis. or other
ghoostly substance ben only wreten in this manner / and to this intent that is
to say as devout ymagynaco^ns and lykenes styrynge simple souls to y^ love of
God. and desire of heavenly things. For as saint Gregorye says. therefore is
the kingdom of heuene lykened to erthely things. that by tho things
Gregorius in Omelia Simile est reg: oe: th:
that been vysible. and that man kyndely knows. he be stered and rauysshed to
love and desire ghoostly inuysyble things that he kindly knows not.

Also saint Jhon says that all tho things that Jhesus did. ben not wreten
in the gospel. wherefore we mowen to styrynge of devotion ymagyne and think
diverse words and deeds of him and other that we find not wreton so that it
be not ageynste the believe as saint Gregore and other doctors sayen. that
holy writ may be expowned and understand in diverse manners and to diverse
purposes. So that it be not against the believe or good manners. And so what
time or in what place in this book is wreton that thus did Nota been
or thus spoke our lord Jhesus or other that been spoken of. and it may not be
preued by holy write or grounded in express sayenges of holy doctors. hit
shall be taken none otherwise than as a devout medytacyon. that hit might so
be spoken or done. And so for as much as in the book ben contained diverse
ymagynaco^ns of Crystys life. the. which life fro the beginning in to the endyng
ever blessed and without sin passing all the lives of all other saints.
as Nome^ libri
for a synguler prerogatyue may worthily be cleped the blessed life of Jhesu
crist. The which also by cause hit may not be fully descryued. as the lives of
other saints. but in a manner of lyknesse as the image of man's face is showed
in the myrrour. Therefore as for a pertynent name to this book hit may
skylfully be cleped the Myrroure of the blessed life of Jhesu Christ.

Ferthermore for to speak of the proffitable and good matter of this book. the
forsayde Clerk Bonauenture speaking to the woman foresaid in his proheme
begins in this manner sentence. Bonaueture Incipit.



Among other virtuous comme^dynges of the holy virgyne Cecille it is wreton
that she bare always the gospel of Criste hid in her breast / that may be
understand / that of the blessed life of our lord Jhesu criste written in the
Gospel. she chase certain parties most devout in the which she set her
meditaco^n and her thought night and day with a clean and holy heart. And when
she had so fully all the manner of his lif ouergone. she byganne ageyn And so
with a liking and sweet taste ghoostly showing in that manner the gospel of
crist / she set and bare it ever in the pryuete of her breast. In the same
manner I counceyll that thou do. For among all ghoostly exercyses I leave /
that this is most necesary and most proffytable. and that may Nota tri^ (...)

bring the to the hyhest degree of good living that stant specially in
parfyghte despysynge of the world in patience suffrynge of Aduersytees and in
encrees and getyng of virtues For sothely thou shall never find where man may
so parfyghtely be taught first for to stable his heart ageynste vanitees and
deceyuable lykynges of the world. also to strength him among tribulacions and
aduersytees. and ferthermore to be kept tro vices and to getyng or virtues. as
in the blessed life of our lord Jesu christ. the which was ever without
defaulte most parfyghte. First I say. that besy medytacyon. Primum
and custommable of the blessed life of Jhesu stableth ye soul and the heart
ageynste vanytees and deceyuable lykynges of the world / this is showed openly
in the blessed vyrgyne Exampluz de ^^a^a cecilia
Cecylle before named / when^e she filled so fully her heart of the life of
christ / that vanytees of the world myghten not enter in to her. For in all the
great pomp of weddyng where so many vanytees ben used. when the Organs blewen
and songen she set her heart stably in God saying and prayenge. Lord be my
heart and my body clean and not defiled. Secundum
so that I be not confounded / Also as to the Secound. whereof have martirs her
strenght against diverse Bernard de martir^bus
tormentys But as saint Bernard says in that they setten all her heart and
devotion in the passion and the wou^des of criste For what time the martyr
stant with all the body to rent. And nevertheless he his glad and Joyful in
all his pain where trowest is than his soul and his heart. sothely in the
wounds of Jhesu ye the wounds not closed: but open and wide to enter in / and
ellis he should feel the hard pain and not mow bear the pain and the
sorrow. but sone faylle and deny god. And not only martirs / but also
confessors vyrgynes and all that lyuen ryghwysely / despysynge the world in
many trybulacyons. Infyrmytees. and deeds of penance. both keeping pacye^ce.
And also more over therwyth ben ioyeful and glad in soul as we mowen seen
always. and why so. but for her hertes ben more proprely in crystes body by
devout medytaco^ns of his blessed life / than in her own bodies. And as to
the. thyrdde point: that it keeps fro vices Tercium
and dysposeth souereynly to geting of virtues / preuethe well in that
perfeccion of all virtues is found in cristes life For where shall thou find
so open ensample and doctrine of sovereign charity of parfyte pouerte of
profunde meknes of patience and other virtues. as in the blessed life of Jhesu
christ Herfore says saint Bernard / that he trauayleth in Bernard super can^er
xx^*
vain. about the getynge of virtues. who so hops to find hem ou where. but
in the lord of virtues. whoos life is the Myroure of Temperau^ce and all other
virtues. Loo here great comfort and ghoostly prouffyte in devout
co^templacyon of crystes blessed body / wherefore thou that coueytest to feel
truly / the fruit of this book. thou must with all thy thought and all
thyn entente in that manner make the in thy soul present to tho things that been here wreten / said or done of our lord Jhesu. And that besely lykyngly
and abydyngly as though thou herdest him with thy bodyly eres. or N
see them with thyn eyes down. putting away for the time and leuyg al other
occupacyons and besynesses. And though it so be that the beginning of the matter
of this book that is the blessed life of Jhesu Christ be at his Incarnacyon.
Nevertheless we mowen first deuontly ymagyne and thing so^me things done
before touching god and his aungellys in heaven. and also as anentes the blessed
vyrgyne our lady saint marie in earth. of the which is to begin.

And for as much as this book is divided and departed in seven parties after
seven days of the weke every day one party. or sum thereof to be had in
co^templacyon of hem that haven thereto desire and deuoco^n. Therefore at the moon day as the first weke day of the weke begins this ghoostly work:
telling first of the devout instaunce and desire. of holy aungellis in heaven
for man restorynge and his salvation to styre man among other that day
specially to worship hem as holy Church the same day makes specially mind
of hem. Also not only the matter of this book is pertynent and prouffytable to
be had in contemplacion. the foresaid day is. to them that will and mow. but
also it longs to the times of the year. as in aduent to read. and devoutly
have in mind fro the beginning unto the Natiuyte of our lord Jhesus. And
thereof after in that holy feste of Crystmasse. and so forth of other matters. as
holy church makes mind of hem in time of ye year. and among other who so
redeth or hereth this book feeling any ghostly swetnesse or grace there through
/ pray he for charity specially for the auctour and the drawer out thereof as
it is wreton here in Englisshe to the prouffyte of simple and devout souls as
it was said before. and thus ends the. prohemye. and after follows the
contemplacyon for mondaye in the first party / And the first chapter.

it in his name saying in these words. This daughter sothfastnes says that
she peryssheth and leseth her name but man have the death that he has deserved.
and with her acordeth her lister ritwysnes. and on y^ other side mercy says
that she perissheth. and leseth her name but man have mercy and be saved / and

went up to her systers telling that men had forfetid and were unable / and

thou shall save man and bestes after thy great mercy. but than was a question
among the systers committed to reison. for Ca* i*
to termyne which perione of three y^ fader and sone. and holy ghost one god
should become man. and do this merciful deed. than said reason / that for as
mykel as the person of y^ fader is propirly R^cio In ca^nacio ni^ ^il^i dei
dredeful and mighty. the person of the sone all wise and wytty. And the
person of the holy ghost most benign. and godely. the second person seineth
most couenyent. as to the full accord of the foresaid systers to the skilful
remedy of man / and to the most reasonable vyctory of the enmy. for as touching
the first if the person of the rader should do this deed / for his dread and
might mercy and pees might somewhat have him suspecte as not fully favorable to
hem. and so on y^ other side / for y^ sovereign bei^gnite and goodness of the
holy ghost. troth and ryt wysnesse might dread of not full satisfaccion. but to
mykel mercy / wherefore as a good mean even to both parties. the person of the
sone is most co^uenyent to perform this deed thorugh his sovereign wit and
wisdom. Also it seems most skylfull remedy to man for as much as he forfend
by vnwytte and folly that satisfaccion be made for him. by soth fast wisdom /

Capitulum secundum.
AS it is written in the life of our lady seint Mary whe^ne she was three year
old / she was offrid in the Temple of fader and mother. and there she abode and
dwelled in to the xiiii. year. And what she did. And how she lived there in
that time. we may know by the rouelacions made of her to a devout woman.
which men trowe^ was seint Elizabeth in y^ which reuelacions is contained
among other that our lady told to the same woman and said in this manner. when
my fader and my mother leften me in the temple. I purposed and Nota propo (...)
set stably in my heart to have god in to my tader and often sythes with great
denocion I thought* what I might do plesynge to God / so that he would
vouchesauf to send me his grace. And herewith I was taught and lernyd the law
of my lord God. In the which law of all the hestes and dyddynges* pryncypally
I kept three in my heart The first is (...)
thou shall love thy lord god with all thy heart: with all thy soul / with
all thy mind. and with all thy myghtes The second. thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy felf. And Ca. iii.
the thyrdde is thou shall hate thine enemy / these I kept trewely in heart /
and anon I concyued and took all the virtues that been contained in hem / For
there may no soul have virtue. but it love god with all the heart. for of this
love comes Nota odiu^ inimicoru*
all plente of grace / And after hit is comen / it abides not in the soul.
but it renneth out as water. but hit so be that he hate his enemies. that is
to say vices and sins. wherefore he that will have grace and keep hit / hit
behooves that he dispose and ordeyne his heart to love. and to hate as it is
said. And so Nota or^ cionem Marie
I will that thou do in manner as I did / I rose up algate at mydnyghte and
went forth before the Altar of the. Temple and there with als great desire
and will and affeccion as I could and might I asked grace of almighty god to
keep tho three hestes and all other byddynges of the law. And so standing Nota
septe^ peticione^ Marie
before the Altar I made seven peticions to god. the which ben these. First I
asked grace of god thorugh the which I myt fulfylle the heste of love. that is
to say for to love him with all my heart. The second I asked. that I might love
my neighbor after his will and his lykyng / and that he would make me to love
all that he loves / The thyrdde that he would make me to hate and to eschew al
thing that he hates / The fourth I asked mekenes / patience. begnignite and
swetnes / and al other virtues / by the which I myt be gracions and plesyng to
gods syte. The v / petico^n I made to god / that he would let me see the time /
in the which that blessed maiden should be borne y^ should conceive and bear
gods sone / and that he would keep mine eyes that I might see her. Mine eres y^ I
myt here her speak: my tongue that I myt praise her / my hands that I myt serve
her / my feet that I myt go to her service: and my knees with the which I myt
honor and worship gods sone in her bar me / In the vi: peticion I asked
grace to be obeissau^t to the co^ ma^dynges of the bishop of the temple / And
in the vii: I prayed god to keep all the people to his service / And when the
forsaid Crystes servant had herd these words / she said again / A sweet lady
were not ye full of grace and of all virtues / And the blessed maiden mary
answered. well thou well for certain / that I held my self as gylty / most
abiecte and unworthy to the grace of god as thou. And more over trowest thou
douter y^ all the grace that I had. I hade without travail. Nay not so. but I
tell the and do the to wete that I had no grace yefte. ne virtue of god
without great trauaylle contynuel prayer / ardent desire proffu^de devotion
and with many teres and mykel afflyccion speaking thinking and doing alweye
as I could and might. that was pleysyng to God. that is to say out take the
holy grace. thorugh the which I was hallowed in my moders womb. And
ferthermore our lady said wete thou well for certain that there comes no grace
in to man's soul but by prayer and bodyly affliccion. And after that we have
yeuen to god tho things that we may though they ben lytyl and few. than
comes he in to y^ soul bryngyng with him so great and so hyhe yeftes of
grace: that it seems to the soul that she faylled in her self. and leseth
mind / and thinks not that ever she said or did any think pleysynge to
god and than she seems in her own sight more foul and more wretchyd than she
was ever before. All this sentence is contained in y foresaid reuelaco^ns / Also
saint Jerome writing of her life seith in this manner that y^ blessid maiden
mary ordained to her self this manner of rule in living. that fro y^ morn (...)
tide in to the tierce of the day. she gaf her all to prayers. and fro tierce
in to y^ none she occupied her bodily with weuyng work. and efte fro none she
went not fro prayers to y^ au^gel of god come and apperid to her of whose hand
she took mete to y^ bodyly sustinau^ce. and so she profited algate better in y^
work and the love of god. and so it befell that she was fou^den in wakyng the
first in the wysdom of gods law most cu^nynge. In mekenes most low / In the
song and the psalms of Dauyd most conuenyent and semely / In charity mnost
gracyous / In clennesse most clean / and in all manner virtue: most parfyghte
She was sad and inuariable so terforth that ds she profyted always better and
better. so was there none that ever saw or herd her wroth / All her speech
was so full of grace that god was known by her tongue. She was contynuelly
dwelling in prayer and in the lore of gods law / and algate be ly about
her felawes. that none of hem should trespace or syn^e in any word. and yt none
should lawhe dyssolutely / And also that none of hem should offend other
thorugh pride or any other wrong. and ever without fayllynge she blessed god
/ And lest per chance by any gretynge or praysynge she should be let ^ro
the loving of god. what time any man great her she answered again Deo gracias.
that in ts say / thanked be god. wherefore of her sprange first that what time
holy men ben greted / they layne again Deo gracias. as she said. She was fed
of the mete that she took of the Angels hand / And that mete y^ she took of
the bishop of the Temple / she gaf to pour men / Every day gods Aungel
spoke with her. and als he should to his derworth sister. or mother. so he served
/ and was obeyssaunt to her / Thus mykel seyth saint Jherome of her life.
Ferthermore in her xiiii. year that blessed maiden Mary was wedded to Joseph /
by reuelacion of god. And then^e went she home again in to nazareth as it is
written by process in the story of her natiuite / But thus mykel at this time
suffyseth to have in mind. and in co^templacion of tho things that befellen
before the Incarnacion the which who so will well think and have devoutly in
mind / and follow virtuously in deed. he shall find hem full of ghostly fruit
/ Now come we to speak of the Incarnaco^n of our lord Jhesu Of the
Incarnaco^n of Jhesu and the feste of the Annuncyacion. And of the gretynge Aue

Capitulu^ Circum*


When the plente of time of grace was come / in the which the high Trynyte
ordained to save mankind / that was dampened thorugh the syn^e of Adam for the
great charity that he had to mankind spyrynge him his great mercy / and also
the prayer and the instau^ce of all the blessed spyrytes of heuene after that
the blessid maiden Mary wedded to Joseph was gone home to Nazareth / the fader
of heuene called to him the Archau^ge^ Gabriel / and said to him in this
manner. Goo to our dear daughter (...)
Marye / the spouse of Joseph / the which is most chere to us of all
creatures in earth and say to her. that my blessed sone has coueyted her /
shappe and her beaulte and chosen her to his mother. And therefore pray her y^
she receive him gladly / For by her I have ordained the hele and sauacyon of
all mankind. And I will forgete and foryeue the wrong that has be done to
me of him here before / Now take heed and ymagyne of ghoostly thing. as it
were bodyly / and think in thine heart as thou were present in the syghte of
that blessed lord / with how benign and glad semblaunce he speaks these
words. And on that other side how Gabriel with a liking face and glad chere
upon his knees knelynge and with dread reuere^tly bowynge receives this
message of his lord And so anon Gabriel risyng up glad and ^ocou^de took
his flight fro the high heaven to earth / And in a moment he was in a man^es
lykenes before the vyrgyne mary. that was in her pryue chamber that time
closed. and in her prayers or in her meditaco^ns / peraue^ture redyng the
prophecy of ysaye touching the Incarnaco^n / And yet also swyftely as he flew
^ernard
his lord was come before. and there he fond all the holy Trimen or his
messager. For thou shall understand. that this blessid Incarnacion was the
hyhe work of all the holy Trinite. though hit so be / that only the person of
the sone was Incarnate and become man. But now beware here that thou err not
in Imaginaco^n of god and of the holy Trinite. supposing that these three
persons / the fader. the sone. and the holy ghost ben as three erthely men /
that thou feast with thy bodyli eye which ben three diverse substau^ces each
departed fro other so that none of hem is other / Nay it is not so in this
ghostly substu^ce of the holy Trynyte. For tho three persons ben one substance
and one god. and yet is there none of these persons other: But yet may thou not
understood by man^es reason ne conceive with thy bodyly wit: And therefore
take here a general doctrine in this matter now. for algate what time thou
herest or thynkest of the Trynyte or of the godhede. or of ghoostly creatures
as Angels or souls / the which you may not see in her propre kind with thy
bodyly eye: ne feel with thy bodyly wit study not to fer in that matter:
occupye not thy wit therewith as thou would understood it by bodyly reason
For it will not be while we be in this boisto^ body living here in earth / And
therefore when thou herest any such thing in believe that passes thy kindly
reason / trow soth fastly that it is soth as holy church techeth and goo no
ferther / And so thou shall bileue in this matter of the Incarnaco^n that the
second person in trynyte Gods sone of henene come in to the earth and took
flesh and blood of the blessed vyrgyne Mary and become very man / and yet
was he never departed fro the fader or the holy ghost in his godhede but ever
was dwelling stylle with hem one very god in heaven. But now for to goo to our
purpos of the Incarnacion before said. take heed and have in mind as thou were
present in the pryue cha^^er af our lady where the holy Trynyte is present with
his Aungel gabriel. O lord what hows is that. where such ghestes ben. and
such things ben done. For though that the holy Trynyte is ever where by
presence of his god head. Nevertheless thou may think and understand that he
is there in a more special manner by reason of his hyhe work of the Incarnacion
/ Gabriel that entered in to Mary's chamber that was stoken fro men. but not fro
angels as saint Bernard says knelynge with reverence began his message in
these words and said Heyle full of grace our lord is with the / blessed be
thou in wymen or above all wymen. Mary than herynge this message and this new
gretynge / that she never herd before was astonyed and abashed. and naught
answerde. but thought what gretynge this might be / She was not abasshet or
troublet by any vycious or sinful distourblynge ne agaste of his presence /
for was wont to Angels presence and to the syghte of hem. but as the gospel
says she was astonyed in his word / that was a new gretynge. For he was
never wont be fore to great her in that manner. And for as much as in that
gretynge she saw her self commended and praised specially in three great
things in yt she was parfyghtely meke. she must needs be abashed in that hyhe
gretynge. For she was commended that she was sul of grace / and that our lord
was with her and y^ she was blessed above all wym^en / And for as much as the
parfyte meke may not here his praysynge / without abasshement and
shamefastnes. Therefore she was abashed and astonyed with an honest
shamefastnes. and also with dread for though she trowed well that the Au^gel
said sothe / Nevertheless she dread his word. for as mykel as they that been
parfytely meke have that propirte / that they reward not her own virtues. but
rather taken head to their own defaultes. where thorugh they mowen a^gate
profit virtuously holdyng in hem self a great virtue. lytyl. and a lytyl
defaulte great. And so as wise and were as shamefast and dredeful she held her
pees and ansuerd not / Here may thou take ensample of Mary first. to love so
lytary prayer and departing fro men. that thou may be worthy Angels
presence. And ferthermore lore of wisdom to here or thou speak. and for to
keep scyle^ce and love lytyl speech. For that is a full great and proutfytable
virtue. For marye herd first the Aungel twyes speak or she would answer ones
again. And therefore hit is an abominable thing and great repreef to a maiden
or vyrgyne to be a great iangler. and namely a Relygyous. Ferthermore after the
gospel the au^gel beholding her semblau^ce and knowing the cause of her
abasshemente and dread. answered to her thought / and spoke more homely
calling her by name and said. Dread thou not Marye. and be thou not abashed /
or ashamed of y^ praising that I have great the with / for so is y^ truth /
and not only thou art full of grace in thy self. but also thou have founden
special grace of god / and recouerd grace to al mankind / Bernar^
For why Loo thou shall co^ceyue and bear a child. and thou shall call his
name Jhesus / that betokens savior / for he shall save fro sin and
dampnaco^n al his people. that trewely hopen in him / Here says saint Bernard /
God grant that my lord Jhesus vouchesauf to nombre me among his people so
that he save me fro my sins / For sothely I dread that many Not^
shown hem as they were of his people / the which he knows not / ne has not
as his people / And as I dread / he may say to many that semen in his people
more religyous and more holy than other / this people worshippeth me with
lyppes but sothely her heart is full far fro me / But wolt thou know where
thou be of his people / or wylt thou be of his people do^ yt our lord Jhesus
bydeth in ye Gospel / and the law and the prophets. and also that he byddeth
by his mynystres and be Bernar^
buxome to his vykers y^ ben in holy church thy soueraines not only good and
well living / but also shrewes and euylle living / And so learn of Jhesu to be
meke in heart and buxome / and than shall y^ be of his blessed people. But here
now ferthermore what the Aungel speaks in praysynge of this child Jhesus / he
shall be great / not in temporal lordship and worldly dygnyte / ^or that he
shall forsake. but he shall be great god and man / great prophet in miracles
wyrchyng great doctor in sothfaitenes prechyng and great co^querour in
myghtely the deuylle ouercomynge / And so worthyly he shall be cleped the sone
of all there highest lord god. the which shall ye^e him the sete of da^id his
fader. for he shall take mankind and be borne in flesh by dese^te of his
aucestrye / And he shall regne in the house of Jacob evermore. and of his
kingdom shall be none end. This house of Jacob is ghostly holy church in y^
which Jhu^s shall reygne in true souls first ouercomyng sins and the
deuylle here in earth by grace: And after in heaven in bliss withouten end /
Here may thou say with saint Bernard (...)
desiring in the ki^gdome of Jhu^: thus. come my lord Jesu. and put aweye al
sclau^ders of ^ynne fro thy reame that is my soul. so that thou may reygne
therein as the owes to do / For couetyse comes and chalengeth his reame in
me* Presumpcyon coueyteth to be my lord. Pride would be my queen / lechery
says I wol regne. De traccion envy wrath and glotony stryuen which of hem
shall pricipally regne in me. and I in as mykel as I wa^e ageynstonde hem / But
thou my lord Jhesu destroy hem in thy virtue / and take thou thy reame and thy
kingdom in me. For I have no true king but thy my lord Jhesu. And when the
Aungel had told these conditions / and the worthynes of this blessid child
the ^^s to that meke maiden mary that was chosen to his mo* der / Than she
spoke first to the Aungel / naught dredyng of his words. ne of her co^ceyuyng
ne knoulechyng ne forsakyng the praysynges before said of his gretynge. but
willing to be more certyfyed plainly of that she dread most that was that she
should not lose her maydenhede. asked of the Au^gel the manner of her
conceyuynge in these words / how and of what manner shall this be done / sith I
know no man flesshely. And I have made a vow to keep me chaste to my lord god
without faylle. and I shall never dele with man flesshly. And than the aungel
answered and said to her. it shall be done by the wyrchynges of y^ holy ghost /
that shall lyghten in to y^ in a synguler manner. and thoru his virtue that is
alther hygest thou shall co^ceyue saving thy maidenhede. and therefore that holy
thing that shall be borne of the shall be named gods sone. and in comfort
ferthermore here of the aungel said. Loo Elizabeth thy cosyn that is old and
was bareyne. has conceived a child now six months apassed / for there shall no
thing be imposible to god Now take here good head and have in mind how first
all the holy Trynyte is there abydinge a fynal answer and asse^t of his blessed
vyrgyne / Mary taking head and be holdyng lykyngly her shamefast se^blaunce her
sad manners Bernar^
and her wise words / And ferthermore how all the blessed spyrytes of heaven
and all the ryghtwys living men in earth / and all the chose^ souls that were
that time in hell as Adam. Abraham Dauyd and all other desyreden her assente.
in the which stood the sauacion of all mankind / And also how the au^gel
gabriel sto^dynge with reverence before his lady enclynyng / and with mylde
semblaunce abides the answer of his mesage / And on that other side take heed
/ how mary stant sadly with dread and mekenes in great auysement / having no
pride. ne vein glory / For all the hyhe praysynge before said / But tho
sovereign yeftes of grace that she has herd yeuen to her that never were give
to creature before all she aretid only to the grace of god / learn you than by
ensample of her to be shamefaste virtuously and meke. for withouten these two
virtues mayde^ Bernar^
head or vyrgynyte is but lytyl worth. For as Saint Bernarde says /
vyrgynyte is a fair virtue. but mekenes is mor necessary. For thou may be sauf
without the first. but without the other that is mekenes thou may not. In
so much that I dar hardly say that without mekenes / the vyrgynite of mary
had not be plesynge to god. For but Mary had be meke ye holy ghost had not
rested upon her says saint Bernard At ye last as the end of the gospel seith
the mylde mayde^ mary. when she had herd and wisely understand the Angels
words by good auysement yaf her assente in this manner as it is written in her
reuelaco^ns she knelyd down with souerain devotion and holdyng up both her
hands: and lyftyng up her eyes to heaven said these words: Loo here the
handmayden and the servant of my lord* be it done to me and fulfilled after
thy word / And so in these meke and low words of Mary. at the end thou have
ensample of great mekenes as thou had in her silence at the beginning: loo
she is chosen gods mother: and of the Aungel cleped full of grace. and she named
(...)
her self his hand maiden. And no wonder. for as saint Bernard says. Mekenes
is ever wont to be fel^w with the grace (...)
of god. But this mekenes was not lytyl. For as he says. It is not mykel to
praise mekenes in abieccion. but it is a great virtue and seldom seen mekenes
in worship. Also sone than as she yaf her answer. gods sone entrid in to her
womb. and thorugh worchyng of ye holy ghost was made man in very flesh and
blod taken of her body. and not as other children conceived and borne by kind
ben shapen membre after membre. and after the soul shed in to the body. but
anon at the first instaunce was full shapen in all members / and all hole man
in body and soul / but nevertheless full lytyl in quantyte. For after he we^ed
more and more kyndely as other children done. So that at ye first he was full
parfyghte God. and man als wise and as mighty as he is now / And when this was
done. Gabriel knelyng down with our lady / and sone after with her rysyng up.
took curtoisli / his leave of her with a devout and low bowynge to ye earth.
and so vanisshed away fro her with a swift flyghte. and took his wey to heaven
agein telling and certyfyenge the holy court of heuene his message fulfilled.
And that that was done in earth: and than was there a new Joye and a new
feste* and full mykel myrthe and solempnyte. Afterward our lady fulfilled and
enfla^med with the holy ghost and in the love of god more brennynge than she
was before. felyng that she had conceived. knelyd down. and thanked god of
that great yefte mekely besechynge him and devoutly prayenge that he would send
her grace and teache her so that all that were after to come and to be done
about his blessed sone that she might fulfylle hem and do hem without
defaulte / And thus mykel touching the Gospel and the process of the
incarnacyon of Jhesu Christ. Of the feste of the annu^ciacion / And of tho
things that befelle that day.



NOw take good head and understood how worthy this feste and this sole^pnyte
is. And have therefore a ghostly myrthe and make a special feste in thy soul
tha^kynge god inwardly. For such was never herd before. for this is the
so^lempnite of all the holy Trynyte. the Fader / and sone and holy ghoost. by
whom this souereyn deed of Incarnacyon was wroughte and fulfilled / as it is
said before. This also is a special feste of our lady saint mary, the which
as this day was chose^ of ye fader of henene in to his dear daughter and of the
sone in to his mylde mother. and of the holy ghost in to his special spouse:
this day is also is special solempnite of all the blessid spyrytys of heaven. for
this day was bigon^e y^ restorynge of her company and felanship that fell
down by syn^e of lucifer. But soueraynly this day is a hyhe feste and a
special sole^nyte of al mankind For this day was mankind soueraynly
worshypped in that he was oned and knyt to the godhede in criste without
departing. And this day bigan the hele and the redemption of mankind: and the
reconcilyng to the fader of heaven. For in to this time god was wroth to
mankind for the syn^e and the trespass of our fornfaders: But fro this time
forth / he may no longer be wroth seeing his dear sone become man. And therefore
is this day skylfully called the plente of time to man / And so this day owes
ever to be had in mind of man and woman. for this day was man made to the
lykenes and the image of god. and set in that Joyeful place of paradyse: and
for to have lived ever without death. and this day the first man Ada^ by y^
fruit of the tree forboden deformed in him that image of god / and lost that
Joyeful place and was dampened to death without ending / But this day the
second Adam Crist god and man reformed this image in his Incarnacion. and after
by virtue of the blessid fruit of his body hangyng on the Tree of ye Cross.
restoryng man to bliss and to life everlasting. Also this day y^ first woman
Eve thoru pride assentyng to the serpent the devil of hell was cause of man^es
dampnacion. And this day the blessid maiden mary thorugh meknes trowyng to the
Angel gabriel was cause of man^es sauacio^. And. so this day man has matter of
great Joye and of great sorrow / First of the great Joye / for the sovereign
goodness worship and grace of god done to him. and also of great sorrow for his
great sin and unkindness done to god ageynward / And this may thou have thy
conte^placyon of Ca. iii
this day. and of this feste blessed of Cristes Incarnacion. and our ladies
annu^ciacion. And for as much as that blessed gretyng of the An^gel gabriel /
wherewith we honouren and greten our lady every day is grounded in this
Gospel. as thou have herd before. Therefore I shall tell the somewhat more here of
/ as me thinks to styre thy devotion the more in seyenge of that gretyng Aue
maria.

AS I conceive this gretynge in manner as holy church has ordained it to be
said / has five parties in the which may be understood specially the five
Joys of our lady And in tho five Joys five virtues that she had in hem
sooueraynly above al erthely creatures. the which ben / mekenes Chastity.
Feythe / hope and Charity / In the first part of this gretyng that stant in
these two words / Heile mary thou Aue maria Annu^cia ^io Humilitas
may understood the first Joys that she had in her annu^ciacion of ihesu
gracious conceyuing of the which meknes was the ground as thou have herd
before: And as these words Hail mary ben the first and the beginning of this
gretyng. so this feste was the beginning of the ground of al other. And as it
was the begyn^yng of Maryes Joye / and all mankind. so is mekenes the
beginning and the ground of al virtues / And therefore in these forsaid words
Heyle Mary. y^ may skylfully understand the first Joye yt she had in her
a^nu^ciacion of the co^ceyuyng of her blessid sone Jhesu. and that specially
thorugh the Gracia ple na Natiuitas ^as^itas
virtue of mekenes / In the second party that sta^t in these words Full of
grace / may be^. understood the second Joye that mary had in Jhesu natyuyte
and her Joyeful beryng. In the which she had soueraynly the virtue of chastity
and of clen^es. and therefore then^e was she specially full of grace in that y^
she clean maiden and mother bare without sorrow that never did woman / but she
all only / In the thyrdde party that is in these words / our Du^s te^u^
lord is with the may be understood the third joy that she had in her sone
Jesu glorious vprysyng / specially by the virtue Resureccio Fides.
of steadfast feith and treue bileue / For fro his death in to that time. he
dwellid al only with her by steadfast bileue that she had that al his apostles
and disciples were^ departed fro him by misbyleue and dyspeyre that he was god
/ And therefore the feythe of holy church tho three days stood al only in her*
so in that time it myt specially be said to her / Our lord is with the. that
is to say by true feyth and believe. and after at his vprysynge more specially
by his bodyly presence first to her appiecing was fulfilled / Our lord is with
the. In the foruth party that is in these words / Blessed be you in wymen or
else above all ^
wymen May be understood y^ fourth Joye that she had in the syte of her sone
ihesu. mytely to heaven ascendyng: in y^ which syte the hope yt she had in his
godhede was fully strengthed. and comfirmed. seyeng that other wymen never did
that was that part that he took of her in flesh and blood bodyly thorugh
the might of the godhede boren up to heaven. and so hoping without dread yt she
should folowe^ after. well tha^ myt ^
it be said. that time and now may to her. Blessid be thou sone raynly in wyme^
seeing thy sone Jhesu mytely asce^dyng* In the fyfte part. that is Blessed be
the fruit of thy womb Jesus may ben understood y^ last joy that she had in
her blessed (...)

How our lady went to Elyzabeth and mekely great her / Capitulum quartum /


AFter the process of the Incarnacion of Jhesu before sayyd. the blessid Maiden
mary having in mind the words of the Au^gel. touching her cosyn Elizabeth /
she purposed to vysyte her for to thank god with her / and also to mynystre
and to serve her. And so with her spouse Joseph she went fro nazareth to her
house beside Jherusalem. that is the space of syxty mile and fourtene. or there
about / She tarried not and let not for the long / and diseasy weye. but
anon she went with haste / For she would not long be seen in open among
folk. And so she was not heuyed nor charged by the co^ceyuynge of her sone /
as comynly ben other wymmen: For our (...)
lord Jhesus was not chargeable to his mother / Now take heed how that blessed
lady queen of heaven and of earth goth al one with her spouse. and y^ not upon
an horse / but on ^oote She ledeth not with her many knights and Barons. ne y^
great company of boure maidens and damoyseles / but sothly there goth with her a
well better company. and that is Pouerte Mekenes. and honest. shamefastues:
they and the plente of al virtues / And the best of all that is our lord god is
with her She has a great and a worshypful company / but not of y^ vanite and
the pomp of the world. And what time she come and entryd in to y^ house of
zacharye / she great his wife Elyzabeth in this manner / All heyle my dear sister
Elyzabeth. And a none here with Elyzabeth glad and Joyful / and lyghtned
thorugh the holy ghoost rose up. and clypped her worthyly and tendyrly cryenge
for Joye. and saying thus. Blessed be thou among wymmen. and blessid be the
fruit of thy womb / And wherefore or of what deeserte is this befallen me.
that y^ mother of my lord should come to me. et ce.. And so forth in the words
of the gospel. And so what time that our lady blessed Elyzabeth. Johan in his
moders womb was fulfilled with the holy ghost. and also his mother. and noute
fuste the mother to fore the sone. but the sone fulfilled y^ mother thoru his
deserte in as mykel. as in him was more fully the grace ^^. iiii
of the holy ghoost. and first he felt and received grace for as he felt the
coming and the presence of our lady / so he felt the coming of our lord /
And therefore he within forth Joyed and she spoke and prophesied without forth /
Behold now and take heed. what and how mykel virtue is in the words of our
lady in that. at one pronu^cyng of hem is given the holy ghost For she was so
fully replenysshed with him y^ thoru her merytes and desert y^ same holy ghost
also filled other. Tha^ to the words of Elyzabeth. Mary ansuerd and said. My
soul magnyfyed our lord. and my spyryte is glad and reyoyced in god my
savior. and so forth saying and fulfyllyng that cantycle Magnificat
of ghostly Joyenge and loving that is Magnificat. as hit is contained in the
gospel / And when she had done / they wenten to sytte to gyder / And our lady
of her sovereign me kenes set her down in the lower place at Elyzabeths
feet / but she anon rysynge up suffered not / but took her up / and so they
sytten down to geder / And then^e asked our lady of Elyzabeth the manner of
her conceyuynge. And she again of the manner of her co^ceyuynge / and so they
tolden either to other gladly the great goodness of our lord. and loueden and
worshyppeden god of either concepcion / and so in thanking god and ghostly
myrthe they co^tynueden day and nytes / For our lady dwellid there the space
of three months seruyng Elyzabeth Nota humilitatem marie
in all that she might. mekely: reuere^tly and devoutly as a servant foryetyng
that she was gods mother / and queen of all the world O lord what house was that

so worthy moders with so noble sons: that is to say Mary and Elyzabeth Jhesus
and Jhon / and also with hem dwelling tho worshipful oldeme^ zachary and
Joseph: This was a blessid company of men: and Nota been

we have ensample that it is leeful and often spedeful devout men and wymmen to
vysite other for edyfycacion and ghostly recreacion / and namely the younger to

that the yeftes of grace may ben certyfyed to other for edyfycacion in time /
so it be not done for wayne glory / but to gods worship. Also if we take good
intent to the words of Mary and Elyzabeth al they were in loving of hem self.
and to worshippynge of god: and magnifyenge him in all his works: and tellyng
his great mercy showed to mankind to styre man to y^ love and the worship of

his liking / and she gladly played with him. and lovely clypped and kyssed
him. And here may we see the great worthynes of this child. For there was
never none other before that had so worthy a berer / After in the: viii. day
as the law would the child was circumcised. and named John by miracle of god /
as y^ gospel tells and the mouth and the tongue of y^ fader zachary before

Bn^dictus were first spoken and made. And our lady standing that time within
some corteyne for she would not be seen of hem that weren come^ to y^
circumcision of that child John. lystened besely and herd ententitly that
ca^tycle / Bn^dictus in y^ which was made mind of her blessid sone Jhus. and
al she kept in her heart / as she that was most wise and full of grace. and at
last when all this was done / she took her leave at Elyzabeth and zacharye and
blessed the child Joh^n Nota pau^tate^ (...)
and so went home ageyn to her own housin nazareth. Now here bithenke the and
have in mind the great pouerte of her in this going again to her own house.
For there she shall neither find bread ne wine / ne other necessaryes and
therewith she had neither possessions ne money / And when she had al tho three
months dwelled with hem that were plentyuous and having. now she torneth
again to her own pouerte and bare house: where she behooves to get her

have compasso^n. and be styred to the love of virtuous pouerte by the ensample
of her. blessid mote she ever be.

Amen /
How Joseph thought to leave pryuely our lady saint Mary / Capitulum v / Ca. v.

WHat time that our lady and Joseph her spouse dwellede^ to gyder / and her
blessed sone Jhesus day by day encreaced bodyly in his mother womb. At the last
Joseph seeing her great with child. and beholdynge her not ones. but often
sythes was sorry. and gretely dystourbled made her heavy chere. and tornyd a wey
his eyes often sythes fro her. And as in a ^
perplexyte thought what he might best do. For on that one side he saw her life
so holy. and no token of syn^e in her. neither in contenau^ce. ne in word. ne
in deed. that he durst ne openly accuse her of auoultre. And on that other side
he knew not how that she might co^ceyue. but by man. wherefore he thout B
that he would pryuely leave her. Sothly it may well be said of him that is
written in the gospel to his praysyng: that is to say that he was a ryghtwys
man. that showed well this deed of great virtue. For sythen comynly auoultry of
the woman is to the man occaso^n of the most shame: most sorrow. and as a
manner of wodenes. Nevertheless he virtuously tempered him self and would not
accuse her / ne avenge him self. but patiently suffrynge that semynge wrong
and ouercomynge him self with pity. though / that he would privily leave her /
This is an open ensample of reprove to ialouse men that be^ so suspicious that
at the last countenance of lovely speech of her wives with other men have hem
suspecte of auoultry / Also yt we here take good entente we may see both in
Joseph and also in Nota de tribulacious pac^n^^^ susan(...) ^ Nota humi ^^acem
ma^^
Mary a fructuous doctrine: hou that we shall patiently suffer trybulaco^n /
And hou that god suffers his chosen souls to be diseased and tempted for her
best and to her mede / For wete we well / our lady was not here without
tribulaco^n / and great disease what time that she saw her husbond so dystour
bled / and nevertheless she suffrid and held her pees mekely and kept pryue
that great yefte of god / and chose rather to behold as wicked vycious and
unworthy. than she would make open y^ great sacrament of god / and to speak
and tell thing that might seem to her praysynge boost or iactau^ce / But
here with she prayed of god that he would send remedy in this caas and that he
would as it were his will / put away fro her husbo^d this tribulaco^n and this
disease / And so our lord that suffered and ordeyneth all thing for the best
to comfort of both send his angel / the which appiered to Joseph in his
sleep and said that he should not dread to take to him Mary his spouse / but
trustly and gladly dwell with her / For that that she had conceived Nota
was not by man / but by the wyrchyng of the holy ghoost and so after
trybulaco^n comes great Joye / and comfort / In the same manner hit should
fall with us / if we could well keep Nota de p(...)
patience in time of aduersyte / for our lord god after tempeste sends soft
and mercy weder. and hit is no doubt that he suffers no te^ptacion fall to
his chose^ / but for her profit / then after his reuelaco^n Joseph asked our
lady of this wonderful conceyuynge / and she gladly told him the order and the
manner thereof. And so Joseph dwelled and stood Joyefull with his blessed spouse
mary and with chaste and true love so fervently loved her that it may not be
told / and besely in all things took head to her. and our lady ageynwarde
trustely dwelled with him / And so in her both pouerte they lyueden to gyder
with great ghostly myrthe / Here with our lord Jhesus Nota
also as recluse and closed in his mother womb. the space of ix months in
manner of other children. pacie^tly and benyngly suffers and a abides the due
time of birth. Lord god. hou much owen we to have compassion that he would for
our sake en clyne to so profou^de mekenes. Mykel owen we to desire and love the
virtue of mekenes. and if we would have besely in mind Nata de humi^i^atem
how that hyhe lord of so great mageste so mykel lowed him self / should we
never be lift up to vain pride and reputacion of our self / For of this one
benefyce of so long reclusion for our sake. we may never do satisfacco^n
worthily or reco^pensacion to him / But nevertheless know we this truly in
heart and with all our affeccion deeuoutly thank we him. specially we that been religyous that he would take us Nota pro(...)sis and religiosis
fro other and graciously depart us fro the world. So that in this. though it
little be somewhat we yield him. y^ is to say that we stand perseuerantly in his
seruyse / For sthely this al only is his benefyce of grace and not our deserte
and that a great benefyce and worshipful in that that we ben not recluse to
pain but to great sykernes / For we be set as in a high and strong Toure of
relygyon / unto ye which the venomous a N
^owes of this wicked world and the distourblynge tempests of that bitter see
may not atteyne or neyghe / but in our defaulte and folly / But for as mykel as
bodyly enclosynge is little worth or naught without ghostly enclosynge in
soul / there fore thou y^ art enclosed bodyly in celle. or in cloystre / if
thou will be with Jhesu virtuously enclosed in soul: First thou must with him
anents thy self in thine own reputaco^n and become a child thoru parfyghte
mekenes / Also thou must keep and love scylence / not spekyng but in time of
need or edyfycaco^n / and ferthermore or thou be borne / that is to say or thou
show thy self outwardly by word either by opinion of perfecco^n. thou must
abide the time of. ix. months that is while y^ art not parfytely grounded in
virtues. and in knowing of gods law for the nombre of the x. commau^dements
to keneth perfeccion of the law. and therefore that y^ is less took neth
inperfecco^n / wherefore as the child that is borne before his kyndely time is
unable to tryue / so who so will show him outward by word or by deed holy
and parfyte or the time that he be parfytely growe^ and shapen in virtues
within forth he is unable to stand as a man in time of temptaco^n by goostly
strength. and to profit of other. and of him self. wherefore closing and
wythdrawynge to our power all our mind fro vanyte and lusts of the world:
besye we us to conform us in clennes of heart to our lord Jhesu / that for our
sake would so closed in the womb of his blessid mother Mary / Also to B
styre us to compassion and to suffer with Jhesu penance and disease in this
world / we should consydere and have in mind that he was in contynuel
afflicco^n fro the first time of his co^cepcion in to the last time of his
death. specially and pryncipally for y^ he knew his fader of heaven. whom he
loved soueraynly / so in vnworshyp of synful men and forsaken for man metry
and mysbeleue. and of that great compassion that he had to the souls made to
his image so wretchidly. and for the most party dampened This was to him more
pain. than his bodyly passion and death. For why / to put awey mysbileue and
destroy N
this dampnaco^n / he suffered that death and that passion. And so should every
trwe lover of Jhesu have compassion and be inwardly sorry / not only for the
mysbileue of Jews and saracenes and her dampnaco^n. but also and much more
for the wicked living of untrue Christian men / In so much that should by to
him more passion and ghostly disease wha^ he knew or saw a soul perisshe
thoru dedely syn^e / than the loss of any wordly catel / or than his own
bodyly death* for y^ will charity. And so in this forsaid process we have
profitable doctrine and good ensample: First in our blessed lord Jhesu of
penance suffryng / of perfect charity and true compassion / Also in his mother
mary of profou^de meekness: and pacyence in tribulaco^n / and in her husbo^de
Joseph of virtuous rit Quare virgo Maria fuit despon sata Joseph
wisnesse against falls suspeco^n. And if we would wit why and whereto our lady
was wedded to Joseph / sythen he had not to do with her bodily / but she was
ever clean maiden Hereto answeryng ben three skylles / First for she should have
comfort and solace of man to her bodily seruyse / and witness of her clean
chastity / The second is that the merueilous birth of goddis sone should be
helyd: and preuy fro the devil / And the thirdde. that she should not ben
diffamed of auoultrye. and so as worthy the death* after the law. be stoned of
the Jews And thus ends the first part of this book that stant in
contemplaco^n for the moneday and for the time of the Aduent. into the natyuyte
of our lord Jhesu. whose name with his mother Mary be ever blessed wythouten end

Amen.
Of the natyuyte of our lord Jhesu. Capitulum Sextum /


WHat time that ix. months fro the concepcion of the blessed Jhesu drewen to
an end Cezar August the emperor of Rome send* out a mau^demente or an heste
/ that all the world subgette to him should be descryued. so that he might
know the nombre of regyons. of cytees. And of the heedes lo^gynge to him that
weren subgette to the emperor of Rome And herefor he ordained and bad that al
men where so ever they dwelleden should go to the Cite of her first birth and
propre lygnage. whereof Joseph y^ was of the lygnage of David whoos Cite was
Bethelehem / took with him his blessid spouse mary that was that time great
with child. and went fro nazareth unto that Cite Bethlehem there to be
no^bred among other as subgette to the Emperor. And so ledynge with him an
ox and an Ass they wenten all that long weye to gyder as pour folk having
no more wordly good. but tho two bestes. And what time they came^ to Bethlehem.
for the great multitude that was therein that same time for y^ same cause they
might get no lodging: but in a common place between two houses that were hyled
above men for to stand therefore the rain. and was cleped a dyuersory. They
were neded to rest in and a bide all that time. In the which place Joseph that
was a carpenter made hem a closer and a cratche for her bestes / Now take here
good head / and have inwardly compassion of that blessed lady and maiden Mary.
how she so young and of so tendyr age that is to say of xv. year and great
with child as nyghe the birth trauayllynge that long weye of rl. mile / and
x. or more in so great pouerte. And yet when she came to the Cite foresaid there
she should rest and asked her barow in diverse places shamefully among uncouth
folk all they werned them and let hem goo. And so for need at last they
took as for herburgh that common place before said* But now ferthermore for to
speak of the blessed birth of Jhesu. And of that clean and holy delyuerau^ce
of his dear mother Mary as it is written in party by reuelacion of our lady. made
hereof to a devout man / when time of that blessed birth was come. that is to
say the sunday at mydnyght gods sone of heaven as he was conceived in his
moders womb by ^ holy ghost without sede of man so going out of y^ womb /
without trauaylle or sorrow / suddenly was up on hyhe at his mother feet / and
anon she devoutly enclynyng with sovereign Joye took him in her arms / and
swetely clyppyng and kyssyng leyd him in her barme. and with a full pappe as she
was taught of y^ holy ghost wesshe him al about with her sweet mylk. and so
wrapped him in the kerchyef of her head. and leyd him in the cratche. and anon
the ox and the ass knelynge down leyden down their mouths on the cratche
/ brethynge at her noses upon the child that they knewen by reason that in
that cold time ye child so simple hiled had need to be warmed in that manner /
And than his mother knelyng down worshipped and loved god inwardly* thanking
and seyenge in this manner / Lord God holy fader of heaven / I thank the with
almy myte that thou have give me thy dear sone / and I honor the almighty god
gods sone / and mine / Joseph also honorynge and worshyppynge the child god
and man. took the sadel of the ass and made thereof a quyschyn our lady to
syte on and a suppoylle to leene to / and so that the lady of all the world in
that simple array beside the cratche having her mylde mode and her lovely eyes
with her inward affeccion upon her der worth sweet child. But in this pour
and simple worldly arraye what ghostly Richesse and inward comfort and Joye
she had / may no tongue tell / wherefore if ye will feel the true Joye and
comfort of Jhesu. we must with him and* with his mother love pouerte / mekenes
and bodily penance / as he Primum de pauper ^ate
gaf us ensample of all these here in this birth / and first coming in to this
world. For of the first that is pouerte / saint Bernard in a sermon of the
natyuite of our lord tellyng how she was borne to comfort of mankind seith in
this manner. Gods sone comforts his people / wolt thou know his people. that
is of whom speaks David in the Sauter and seith / Lord to the is bilefte the
pour people / And he him self says in the Gospel / woo to you Rich men that
haue^ your comfort here. How should he comfort hem that haven here Nota bent
her own comfort. wherefore Crystes Innocence and childhode. comforts not
Janglers and great spekers. Crystes weeping and teres comfort not dysolute
laughers. His simple clothyng conforteth not hem that gone in proud clothing
/ and his trable and rack / comfort not hem that louen first setes and
worldly worshyppes. And also the Angels in Cristes Natiuite appierynge to the
wakyng sheepherdes. comforten none other / but pour traueyllers. and to hem
telle^ they the Joye of new light / and not to the Rich men that haue^ her
Joye and comfort here. Also as to the second we may see at this birth both
in Criste and in his mother parfyte mekenes. For they were not S(...)
squeymous of the stable ne of the bestes. ne of heye and other such abiecte
symplenes. But this virtue of mekenes both (...)
our lord and our lady kepten parfytely in all their deeds and commended it
soueraynly to us. wherefore be we about with all our might to get this virtue
knowing that without it. is no sauacion. For there is no work or deed of us
that may please god with pride / Also as to the thyrdde we may see in hem
both. and namely in the child Jhesu / not a lytyl bodyly penance. Of the
which saint bernard says thus. Gods sone T(...) C^rpets lie (...) Bernard
see (...). (...)
when he would be borne that had in his own free will to chese what time he
would take thereto / he chese that time that was most noious and hard / as the
cold winter. namely to a young child and a pour womans sone / y^ scarscely
had clothes to wrappe him in and a rack as for a cradel to leye him in / and
yet though there was so mykel need / I find no mind of furrys or pilches. And
sythe^ Christ that is no begyler chase that is most hard to flesh. sothely
that is best most prouffytable and rather to be chosen and who so techeth or
byddeth other he is as a falls deceyuour to be fled and forsaken / All this
says saint* Bernard. and thus much of these virtues at this time. Go we now
ferthermor to speak of the forsayde blessed natyuyte of Christ. what time yt
our lord was so borne the great company of Angels that there were honoryng
and worshyppyng her lord god / went anon to the sheepherdes that were there
beside about a mile fro Bethleem tellyng hem ye* birth of her savior / and
also ye place thereof by one of them appierynge wtyh great light / perauenture
Gabriel that was special messager of this work / And therwyth all that
multitude of Angels token up that new Joyeful song saying as the gospel
tells in these words. Joye without end above in alther hyhest heaven to
God. and in earth pees to all men that been of good will. And so with that
Joyeful song and my kel mirth they wenten up in to heuene tellyng their other
^e laws these new Joyeful tidings of their lords blessed birth. whereof all
the Court of heuene Joyeful and glad more than tongue can tell: or heart
think. making a solemn feste and devoutly thankyng the fader Almighty god*
as we may devoutly think and ymagine come^ al after by order to see that
lovely face of gods sone their lord with great reverence worshyppynge him
and his blessed mother / Here to according speaks the apostel saint Paul in
his pystle Ad Hebreos sa yenge that when the fader of heuene brought his first
gote^ sone in to this world. he badde that all the Angels of God should
worship him. Also ye herdmen after the Angels we ren passid fro them camen
and worshyppiden this child. tellyng openly what they herden of the Angels and
his dear mother. as she that was soueraynly wise and wytty took good head of all
that was done and. kept pryuely in her heart all the words that were spoken of
her blessed sone. Thus mykel and in this manner we may have in comte^placyon
touching the process of the blessed Natyuyte of our lord Jhesus. And
ferthermore touching the solempuyte of this feste. and this hyhe day we should
have in mind that this day is borne the king of bliss and the sone of
Almighty god. lord of all lords and maker and gouenour of all the world /
whose name is cleped specially prince of pees. for by him was made that great
and endeles pees. that is told before the Incarnaco^n. wherefore this day the
Angels songen that Joyeful song Gloria in excel sis deo. as it is said before
this day. as holy church syngeth in the mass after the prophecye of ysaye. A
child is borne to us that is like to us in his manhede / and a sone is yeuen to
us that is even to the fader of heaven in his godhede. Also this day the sone of
ryghtwysnes yt was first under cloud spread de openly his beams of mercy. and
the light of his grace in all the world. And so this day was seen yt blessid
new sit that never ere was seen in earth. that is to say god almyty in man's
lykenes. This day also befell tho two kinds that passen all kind and al
men^es wit. the which may al only be conceived thorugh trwe believe. that is
to say that god is borne and a mayde^ without sorrow or blemysshyng of her
maydenhede has borne a child. wherefore this day had she that second souerayn
Joye in felyng done in deed. that she yaf feyth to. spoken before and behyt of
the angel of her conceyuyng: and so to al ma^kynd this day is of great Joye and
a great fest / both of god almighty and of his blessid mother mary as it is said
before in the feste of the Incarnaco^n for all the skylles that there were said
began^e and here more plainly fulfilled Join: that to this and than it will
show pleynly / In token also and in witness of this wonderful birth against
kind at Rome that day out of a tavern sprang a well of oylle / and in the
same Cite an image of gold with a Temple that was cleped y^ ever lasting
Temple of pees for as mykel as hit was prophesied that should never fall down
till a maiden bare a sone: this day fell down both to gyder anon as Criste
was borne / In the which place is now made a church in the worship of our
lady saint Mary / whose name with her blessid sone our lord Jhesus blessid be
now and ever wythouten end

Amen
Of the circuncisycion of our lord. Captlin Septimu^*
IN the eyghte day that the child was borne. he was circumcised Ca. vii.
after the byddyng of the law. And so in this day two great things were down
that we owen to have devoutly in mind. the first is that the blessed name
Jhesus that ever was without begyn^ynge yeuen to him of the fader of heaven.
and also of the Au^gel cleped and told or he were conceived / This day was
openly declared and named. And he there with specially cleped Jhesus that is as
mykel to say as sauy our / and this name resonably is above al names / For as
the A postle Peter says. there is none other name under heaven in the which we
owen to be saved / Of the which name and great worthynes and virtue thereof
saint Bernard speaks devoutly by process that shall be said after / The second
thing Bernard super can.
that was done this, day worthy to be had in mind is. that this day our lord
Jhesus began to shede his precious blood for our sake. he bygan by time to
suffer for us / and he that did never sin / began this day to bear pain in
his sweet and ten dir body for our sin / Mykel out we to weep and have
co^passiou with him / For he wept this day full sore / and so in the se great
festes and solempnytees we should make mykel myr the / and be Joyeful for our
hele. and also have inward co^passo^n and sorrow for the peynes and anguysshes
that he suffered for us For as it is said before this day he shed his blod
when that after the right of the law his tendyr flesh was cut with a sharp
stonen knyf / and so the young child Jhesus our sauy our kyndely wept for y^
sorrow that he felt there through in his flesh. For without doubt he had
very flesh / and kyndly suffrable as have other children / should not we
then^e have compassion of him / yes sothely / and also of his dear mother. For
well may we wete that when she saw her lovely child weep she might not witholde
weeping. and than may we ymagyne. and think how that lytyl babe in his moders
barme seeing her weep put his hand to her face as he would not that she
should weep. And she ageynward inwardly styred and having compassion of the
sorrow and y^ weeping of her dear sone. with kyssyng and speaking comfortyd
him. as she might. For she understood well by ye Inspiracion of the holy ghost
that was in her the will of her sone. though he spoke not to her. and there for
she said. Dear sone if thou wylt that I ceace of weeping ceace thou also of
weeping. For I may not but I weep what time that I see the weep: and so thorugh
the compassion of the mother. the. child ceased of sobbing and weeping: And
then^e his mother wypyng his face and kysyng him and puttyng the pape in his
mouth. comforted him in all the manners that she might. Cause (...)*
And so she did as often as he wept. For as we may suppose. he wept often
sythes. as other children down to show the wrechidnesse of mankind that he
verily took. and also he hyd him fro the devil that he should not know him: as
for god. And thus much suffyseth to be said at this time of the circumcision
of our lord Jhesu. But now in time of grace ceaceth this circumcision of the
old law. and we have in that stead baptysme ordained by Christ. that is the
sacrament of more grace and less pain / But for that bodily circmcision we
shall have ghoostly circumcision / that is kuttyng awey al superflue things fro
us that disposen to syn^e / and holding with us as in affeccion only that is
nedeful to virtuous living / For he that is truly pour. is virtuously
circumcised / the which circumcisyon the Apostle techeth in these words. when
he says that we hauyge mete and drink. and cloth we should hold us paid.
This also ghoostly circumcision needs to be in all our bodyly wits / as in
seeing. heringe. touching and other that is to say that we in all these eschew
superfluyte and keep scarcite. and namely in speaking. For mykel speech
without fruit is a great vice and displeysyng to god and good men / and a
token of an unstable and a dissolute heart. as ageyn ward. scyle^ce is a great
virtue / and for great cause of goodness ordained in religion / of the which
virtue diverse clerks speken. that Ca* vii.
we shall pass over at this time / and thus ends this chapitre Of the
Epiphanie that is open showing of our lord.

Ca viii


First touching this solemn day and worthy fest we shall understand that
there is none feste that has so much diverse service in holy church as
longing thereto / as this feste has / not for hit is more worthy than other
but for many great things be fell and were done this day. specially touching
the state of holy church / As first understanding that holy church here in
earth stante in two manner of people / that one is of them that come^ of the
Jews that hadden moses law and weren circumcysed. that other is of the
remanaunt that weren not circumcised and weren Primum factum
cleped gentyles / This day that is to say the xiii: day fro the natyuyte
accou^tynge that same day. the blessid child Jhesus showed him as god and man
specially to the kings that were^ of the gentyles / And in her person holy
church now crystned is pryncypally gadred of y^ multitude of gentyles. was
thus received of*our lord God to true believe.

For the day of his natyuyte he appiered and showed him specially to the Jews
in the person of herdemen. the which Jews for the most party received not
gods word. and by leave / but this day he showed him to the gentyls. of whom
we come^ that been now his chosen church / wherefore this feste is specially and
propirly the feste of holy church of true criste^ men / The second thing
that was done this day touching S^^m factum
holy church is that she was this day ghostly wedded to criste and truli
knytte to him by the baptysme that he took this day xx. and ix. year co^plete.
For in the baptism b^ souls weded to criste and the congregation of christian
souls is cleped holy church that baptysme is wesshen and maade clean of
thefylthe of syn^e and clothed new in virtues. The third is that same* (...)
day xii. month that is to say a year after the baptysme of crist he wrought
that first miracle at the bridale tourning water in to wine. by the which is
understood also y^ ghostly bridale of holy church. The fourth thing y^
befelle that day (...)
is as Bede says that in y^ same day a year after our lord Jhs wrout that
great miracle. fedyng the great multitude of people with a few loves / and a
few fysshes. but the first three ben reherced this day in holy church. and
not the fourth. Loo how worshipful this day is y^ which god chese specially to
worship (...)
there in so many great and wonderful things*

wherefore holy church co^syderynge* so many great benefices done to her this
day of her ghostly spouse Jhu Crist. by wey of due kyndenesse makes great
myrthe and solempnite in this day. But for as much as princypall and most
special y^ sole^pnyte of this day stands in the mind of the first y^ is the
worshippyng of the kings. and her offryng to Jhesu. Therefore speak we
ferthermore of the cotemplacion hereof. leuynge the remenaut at this time And
so ymagyne we and set we our mind and our thot as we were present in the
place where this was done at bethleem beholding how these three kings comen
with great multitude and a worshipful company of lords and other servants.
and so by token of the sterre first ledyng and after restyng upon that place
that the child Jhesus was in there they lyghted done of dromedaries that they
roden up on / before that simple house and manner of stable / in the which our
lord Jhs was born. And our lady then^e heryng great noise and steryng of people.
anon took her sweet child in to her bar me. And they coming in to that house.
as soon as they saw y^ child the^ kneled down and reuere^tly and devoutly
honored him as king and worshypped him as god. Lord god. how great and how
sad was her feythe and bileue: that such a lytyl child so simple clothed
fou^den with so pour a mother in so abiecte* a place without company without
meyne. and without al worldly array should be very god and king. and lord of
all the world / And nevertheless they bileued sothfastly both two: this was a
great godenes of our lord god ordeinyng such forleders and such begyn^ers of
our bileue. and so it behooves to be / Ferthermore touching the process we
may think how the kings after the first honourynge of the child speken with
his mother reverently the condycyons of him / in what manner he was conceived and
borne and so of other that they desyreden to know. and our lady mekely
ansueryng told them of al as it neded. and they yeuyng full crede^ce and believe
to all that she said* and for as mykel as they were clerks and men of the great
wysdom / therefore we may supuose that they couden the la^gage of Hebrew and
spaken in that tongue that was the moders tongue of our lady and al Jews. Now
take we here good entente to the manner of speaking in both parties / First how
reverently and how curtoysely they speke^ and asken their questions / and on
that other side how our lady with a manner of honest shame fastness holding
down hit eyes toward therth speaks and answerthe sadly and shortly to her
askynges. for she has no lykyng speak much or to be seen. Netheles our lord
yaf her strength and special comfort to speak more homly to them by cause y^
they represe^tede^ ^o^a
holy chirch that was then to come of the gentyls as it is said before /
Behold also y^ child Jhesus how he speaks not but stant with a manner of sad
se^blau^t and glad chere: and as he understood hem lovely lokyng upon hem. and
they have great liking in the sight of him / not only ghostly in soul of his
godhede as illumyned and taught of him / but also in his bodily sight
wythoutforth. for as dauyd wytnessith he was fair and lovely in body before al
men^es sons* and so when they were gretely comforted by him they made her
offryng to him in this manner as we may suppose. they opened her Cofers with
her tresour and spredynge a tapet or a cloth before the childs feet our lord
Jhu* they leyde^ thereupon. and offrid echone of them gold e^nce^se* and myrre.
and that in great qua^tyte. namely of gold. for else as for a lytyl offrynge it
had not neded hem for to have opened her tresour as the gospel seith / but her
amonerers or her tresourers myt litly have had it in hand and taken it hem.
but therefore the yeftes and y^ qua^tite were great by reason as it is said And
wha^ they hadde^ thus offered and leid their yeftes before him then^e reuere^tly
and dououtly falling down they kyssede^ his feet. and then^e peraue^ture y^
child full of wisdom for to comfort hem more and stre^gthe them in his love yafe
them his hand to kiss. and after blessed them there with. and so they
reuere^tly enclinyng and also taking her leave at his mother and Joseph with
great joy and goostly myrthe as y^ gospel says turned aye^ in to her own
country by another way. what y^ these three yeftes offrid of the kings betoke^
ghostly and many other things y^ the gospel more over tells as hit is
expowned by holy doctors is suffycye^tly and fully wreto^ in other places.
wherefore we passe^ over all that here. But what hope ye was done with that gold
of so great price whether our lady reserved it and put it in tresore or else
bought therewith land and rentes: Nay god forbede. for she that was a parfyt
lover of pouerte took no head of no worldly ^o^de (...)
goods; but what she loving pouerte and understanding her blessed sons will*
not only thoru his inspiraco^n techinge her in soul within forth. but also by
sing showing his will without forth that he loved not such Ca. viii.
Riches / perauenture tornynge away often sythes his face fro that gold or
spyttynge thereupon. within a few days. ^ short time she gaf it al to poor
men. For the keeping thereof that lytyl time was to her but a great burden. and
heavy charge / and that seems well / for she made her so bare of money / that
when she should goo to the Temple for to be puryfyed she had not wherwyth to bye
a lamb for to offer for her sone But oonly bought turtules or douues of lytyl
price. that was the offrynge of poor folk after the law / And so we may
resonably believe that the offrynge of the kings was great and rich. and that
our lady loving pouerte and full of charity gaf it in have to poor men / as it
is said. So that here is showed Nota de pe^te^^a humilitate
a great precony and worthy ensample of pouerte / Also if we here take good
head / we may see open ensample of parfyght mekenes. for there ben many that
holde^ hem self low and abiecte in her own heart and ben not eleuate by pride
as in their own sight / but nevertheless they would not be holde^ such in other
menes syte ne may not suffer to be despised or scorned of other / And also
they would not that their unworthiness / and their defaultes were known of
other. leest they were despised and repre^ed of them: But thus did not this
day that child Jhs lord above al other / for he would that his lowenes and
abiecco^n were known and seen to his and to other / and that not to simple and
few but to great and many / that is to say to kings and lords. and their

in the which by reason it was mykel to dread / that is to say. leest they

not to fulfylle the perfeccion thereof yeuynge to us ensample that we should not
go fro the ground of true mekenes. by color of any semelynes prouffyte or

DE mora dn^i apud presepe continetur in proximo capitulo excepta meditacio^e
de ministerio suo and solicitudine circa pueru^ Jhesum de quibus poterit quis
feliciter meditari
Of the puryfycacion of our lady saint Marye. Capitulum Nonum.
AFter the time the kings had performed her offryng and were gone home again
in to their own Country as it is said / yet stood that worthy lady of all the
world in that simple herburgh with her blessed sone Jhesu and her husband that
holy old man Joseph at the rack pacie^tly abydyng unto the xl. day ordained
by the law puryfycacyon as she were another woman of the people defouled
thorugh sin. and as the child Jhs were a poor man and not god ^edy to keep
ye obseruau^ce of the law. But why hope we that they dyden thus. Sothely for
ensample to us showing the true way of obedience. And for they would no
synguler prerogatyf. they kepten the common law as other did. but thus done
not many that lyuen in common co^gregaco^n. the which desire to have special
prerogatyues: and thereby will be seen more worshipful than other and synguler
above other. but this suffers not true mekenes. wha^ ye xl. days were come^
of her puryficaco^n after the law / then^e went our lady with her sone Jhesus
and Joseph. and took the way fro Bethlehem in to Jhe rusale^ that is about /
v. or vi. mile there to present the child and offer him to god in the Temple
after that hit is wryte^ in the law of god. Now let us here goo with hem by
devout conte^placo^n. and help we to bear that blessid byrthen. the child
Jhesus in our soul by deuoco^n. and take we inwardly Contemplacio
good entente to all that been here said and done. For they ben full devout In
this manner then they herynge and bringyng the child Jhesus into Jherusalem
and the lord of the temple in to the Temple of god. at the enter thereof they
boughte^ two turteles or else two douue birds to offer for him as the manner was
for pooer folk. And therefore the gospel speaks not of a lamb that was the
common offryng of rich men. in token that they weren with the poorest folk.
And here with that right wise man Symeon lad in spirit by the holy ghoost came
in to the temple to see that he had long time desired christ gods sone after
the byhest and answer of the holy ghost and anon as he came and had the sight
of him knowing him by spyryte of prophecye he knelyd down and deuoutely
honored and worsipped him as he was in his moders arms borne. and ye child
blessed him and lokyng upon his mother bowed toward him in toke^ that he would
goo with him and so the mod understanding the chyldes will. and thereof
wo^dryng took him to Symeon. and he with great Joye and reverence clippyng him
in his arms / rose up blessyng god: and saying with glad spirit: Lord I
thank the for now thou letest thy servant after thy word in pees / For why I
have seen with mine eyes thy blessed sone our savior / And after ward he
prophesied of his passion and of the sorrow there: of / that should as a sword
perce and wound the moders heart Herewyth also that worthy wydow Anne the
prophetess came to them in to the temple / and worshippyng the child she
prophesied of hem also / and spoke of redempco^n that was to come by him to
mankind / And the mother wondryng of all these words kept them by good
intent pryuely in her heart And then the child Jhesus stretchynge his arms to
ward his mother was bytaken her again / Afterward they yeden in manner of
processyon toward the altar with the child the^ which processo^n is presented
this day in all holy church with light brennyng to gods worship / And then^e
they went in this manner. First / to two worshipful old men Joseph and simeon
gone before Joyeful either holdyng other by the hands And with great myrthe
singing and saying. Lord god we have received this day thy great mercy in
mids of thy temple. And therefore after thy great name. so by thy loving and
thy worship in to the ferdest end of all the world. After them followed the
blessed mother and maiden mary beryng the king S(...)
of heaven Jhs: and with her on that one side goth that worshpful wydowe Anne
with great reverence and vnspecable Joye. loving and praysyng god. This is a
solemn and worshipful procession of so few persons. but great things be
tokenyng. and represe^tynge: For there ben or al states of mankind some that
is to say of men and wym^en old and young maidens and wydowes: Ferthermore
when they were come to the altar of the temple. the mother with reverence
knelyng down offryd her sweet sone to the fader of heaven. saying in this
manner. Takes now hyhest fader your dear sone whom I offer here to you after
the bidding of your law: For he is first borne of his mother. But god fader I
beseech you that ye give him to me again And then^e she rysyng up lift Nota

him on the altar. O lord god what offryng is this Sothly there was never none
sythen such another fro the begyn^yng of the world ne shall never after in to
the end. Now take we here good head how y^ child Jhesus sit upon the altar
as it were another child of the common people and with that lovely face and sad
chere he looks and beholds upon his dear mother and other that there were
present pacyently and mekely a bydynge what they would do with him and
therwyth were brought the prestys of th Temple and the child lord of all the
world was bout again as a servant for v. pens that were^ cleped sycles a
manner of money after the law as other. and when Joseph had paid that money
for him the mother. our lady took again with full glad will her blessid sone:
and after she took the forsaid birds of Jhoseph. and knelyng down and lyftyng
up devoutly her eyes in to heaven / holdyng them in her hands offered them
saying thus. Almighty and mercyful fader of heaven vnderfonge ye this little
yefte and offrynge and the first yefte yt your lytil child this day presents
to your h^he mageste of his simple pouerte. And there with the child thesus
puttyng his hondes to ye birds and lyftynge his eyes up to heaven spoke not but
shows countenance of his offrynge with the mother: and so they leyden them
upon the Altar Now here taking head what they ben that thus offren that is to
say the mother and ye sone. Trow we whether that of fryng though it were lytil
might be forsake. Nay god forbede* But we shall fully trow that this was by
Angels presented up in to the. Court of heaven / And thereof fader of heaven full
gladly accepted. so that the blessed company of heaven there thorugh was
rejoiced and gladed After this was done and so the law fully kept as it is
seid in all that that longed to the child from his birth in to this time our
lady with her blessed sone and her spouse Joseph took the way fro that Cite of
Jerusalem homeward in to nazareth. But by ye way she visyted her cosyn /

And thus ends the first part of this book in contemplacion for the
monedaye.
Of the fleing of our lord Jhesu in to Egypt. Capitulum Decimum.
When our lady and her child Jhesus were toward Nazareth as it is said before
/ not knowing yet the pryuy cou^ceylle of god hereof that Herod the king
purposed to slay the child Jhesus / the Aungel of god a piered to Joseph in his
sleep / bidding that he should flee in to Epypte with ye child and his mother /
For Herod would seche the child to slay him. And anon Joseph wakyng of his
sleep cleped our lady. and told her these hard tidings / and she in haste
took up her dear sone and began to goo. For she was full ^ore agaste of this
word / and she would not as she myt be seen neclyge^t in the keeping of him /
wherefore anon in that night they toke^ the wey toward Egypt / and so fled
that great lord the pursuit of his servant. ye more propirly the deuyls
servant trauayllynge with him his young and tendyr mother / and that old man
Jhseph by a noyous wey and hard and diverse that was not inhabited. and also a
wey that is long that is to say after the common saye^ge the space of xii: or xv
/ days Jorney of a common currour. peraue^ture to them hit was travail of two
months or more and that wey as it is said was by that deserte in the which
the children of Israel lad out of Egypt dwell leden xl. year Lord how did
they there of her lyuelode. or where rested they and were herberowed in the
nyghtes / For in that way found they full seldom any house / Here ought we to
have inwardly compassion of hem / and not be loath or think trauellous to do
penance for our self / sythen other took so great and so often trauaylle for
us / namely they that were so noble and so worthy / Also in this process if
we take good heed we may see many good ensamples and notable doctrynes to us /
First if we take good head how our lord Jhesus took Qua^no^ nobili^ Primum
Paciencia inter prospera et a^ pera
in his own person sometime prosperity and welthe / and sometime Aduersyte and
woo / we should not be styred to Inpacie^ce what time that hit befalle to us in
ye same manner / but in time of temptacion and discomfort / abide with patience
the time of prosperity and of comfort / and so ageynwarde on that other side
/ And if thou wylt see ensample hereof in Jhesu / Loo first in his birth he was
magnified of the herdmen / as god and honored and worshipped of them as god /
and with great Joye / And soon after he was circu^cysed as a synful simple man
with sorrow / After the kings coming to him worshipped him soueraynly both
in their persons and great yeftes. and yet dwelled he stylle in that stable
among bestes in pouerte weeping as another child of a simple man. After he was
presented in the Temple with Joye and great things were prophesied of him as
of god Almighty. and now he is boden of the Aungel to flee fro Herod in to
Egypt. as he were a pour man without might: And so ferthermore in all his
life prosperity and aduersite meddled to gyder. to ensample and techyng of us.
For he sent us diverse comfortes to lift up our hope that we fall not by
dispeyre / and therwyth he sent us tribulacions and disco^fortes to keep us in
mekenes that thereby knowing our own wretchydnes we stand algate in his
dread* The second lesson that we may learn in this process is touching the
benefyces and the special comfortes (...)
of god. that he yt feleth them specially be not there by eleuate in his own
syghte. as holdyng him more worthy tha^ other that have them nout. And also he
that feleth not suc^ special yeftes or co^fortes. be not therefore cast down by
sorrow or envy to him that has hem. For as we see here the Angels appieryng
and spekyng of the child. weren to Joseph* and not to our lady / And
nevertheless yet was he less in merit mykel more unworthy than she: Also here
we may learn that he that feleth suc^ specyal yeftes of god: though he have hem
not algate as he would. and after his desire. that there thorugh he gruche not.
ne be not heavy by unkindness against god. For notwithstondyng that Joseph was
so nyhe and acceptable to god. Nevertheless the appierynges of the Angels and
the reuelacions were not done to him openly and in wakyng. but in manner of
dremes and in his slepynge / The thyrdde notable thing that we have Ensample
of here is: How that our lord suffers his derlynges to be dyseased here
thorugh persecucions and tribulacions. and that shows well here in Mary and
Joseph what time they knew the child sought to be slain what might they here
more sorouful. For though it so were Tercium Tribulaco^ electorum
that they knewen and wysten well that he was gods sone: Nevertheless the
sensualite and the reason of hem myt kyndely ben distourbled and meued: that is
to say in this manner. lord god fader Almighty what need is hit to thy blessid
sone. that here is to flee as thou mytest not defend him fro his enemies and
keep him sauf here. And also her tribulacion and disease was in so much the
more / that hem behooves to goo in to so far a land that they knew not and
that by hard weyes and noyous. sythen they weren so mykel undisposed to going
and trauayllyng / our lady for yongth and tendyrnes and Joseph also for elde
and feblenesse. and also the child / that they should bear and carye. was
uneaths two months old. and yet here with they yeden in to that land. in
the which they as pour and unknown had not to help hem self with. All these
dyseases we ren to hem matter of great trybulaco^n and afflycco^n. and therefore
thou y^ suffrest here trybulaco^n. keep theryn patience. and look not to have
hereof pryuelege of him that would not take him Quartum Benignitas erga in

self it ne give it his mother. The fourth notable thing that we may co^sydere
here is. y^ great benignyte and mercy of our lord For there as he might anon
in a momente have dystroyed his enemies that pursueden him. yet would he not.
but benygnely and swetely. he chose rather to flee and give stead for the time
to the malice and the wodenesse of that wicked Herod than to be aue^gyd as he
might ryghtwysly of him. and this was a profu^de mekenes and a great patience /
In the same manner should we do / that is to say / not wilfully wythstonde and
seek vengeance of hem that done wrong and pursewen us / but patiently for the
time forbere hem / and flee her malice and more over specially pray for hem as
god techeth us / Also in an other place of the gospel to do to our enemies as
we would be done to / Ferthermore as to y^ process of the fleing of Jhu with
his mother and Joseph wha^ they comen to Egypt anon at the first entente all
the mawmentes of that land fell down as it was prophesied before by y^
prophet ysaye And then went they to a Cite of that land. that hyghte
Hermopolis or lymopolis. and there they hired hem sum simple house where they
dwelleden seven year as pilgrims and strangers poor and nedy: Here may we
devoutly ymagyne and think of the manner of living of them in that strange
land. and how our lady wroughte for her lyuelode / that is to say with nedil
sewynge and spynnynge as it is written of her / and also Joseph wyrchynge in his
craft of Carpentry: And how the child blessed Jhesus after he came to the age
of five year / or there about. yede on her era^des and halpe in that he might
as a poor child to hem showing in all his deeds buxomnesse / lowenesse. and
meekness / And sythen hem behooved to get her lyuelode in that manner with her
trauaylle / and parauenture with reprefe often sythes of them that they dwelled
among. as hit falls comynly to strangers and also with shame. what hope we
of her howshold / as of beddynge. clothing. and other necessaryes. whether
they hadden in this superfluyte or curiositee / Nay without doubt: they that
louen parfyte pouerte would not have though they myte that yt is contrary to
pouerte. as superfluyte and curiosite. And namely touching curiosite. Trow
(...)
we yt our lady in her sowynge or other manner wyrchyng made curious works. as
many folk done. Nay god forbede / For though they wyrchen such curiositees
that take none head to lose ye time. she that was in that need might not: ne
would not spe^de y^ time in wayne. as many done namely in these days. For this
vice of curiosite is one of the most perilous vice that is. and that by many
skilles may be showed / First by lesynge of time that is ordained to the
worship of God / Prim^ (...)
For such curious work ocupieth mykel more time: than would other plain and
simple work do that were suffysaunt to the need / and that is a great shame
and contrary to gods will The Second harmethat comes Secunda racio
of curiositee is cause and matter of vain Joye to the wyrcher. As what time a
man makes such a curious work. often looks he there on with liking. and
thinks and ymagyneth in is ghoost besely / Also when he wyrcheth not / and
specially in time of gods service / and when he should have his heart to god
/ thinks or speaks for to make that curiosytee / and thereby holds him self
subtyle and wytty / And so would be seen passing other / Also hit is cause of
pride to him Tercia racio
that the curyouse work is maade to / For as simple plain / and boistons
works ben occasions of lowenesse and meekness / so ben curious works as
oylle norysshynge the fire of pride in y^ holders and hauers of hem Also hit is
to hem Quar^a racio
that have liking in such curiositee? matere for to draw their hertes fro
our lord god and heavenly things / For as saint Gregory says / In as mykel
as man has delight here bynethe in erthely things / in so mykel again is he
departed fro the love above of heavenly and godly things / Also it is one of
the three by the which all the world is Quinta racio
infecte in sin. y^ the is foul lust of eyes / For such curiositees seruen
to naught else / but to feed the eyes / And as often as a man lykyngly and in
vain with such curiositee fedeth his eyes? so often the maker and the vser
offendyth god / wherefore men should be eschewynge such curiositees for yeuynge
occasion of sin / For a man should not assente to sin for any cause / But in
all manner absteyne fro the Sexta racio
offeuse of god / And sythen our lord yafe Ensample / and commends and
loneth pouerte as it is often said without doubt it follows that he is gretely
offendyd in that thing that is direct contrary to pouerte that is specially
curiositee / Also with all other harms more over this is. that it is a token
Sep^^ma racio ^ septimu^ malum
of a vain and a light and unstable heart and foul. wherefore he that will
live in clennesse of conscience* and without de fylynge of his soul / him
behooves to absteyne him both fro the making and also fro the using of such
vain curiositees / and to flee there fro a fro a venomous serpe^te Never
theles by this foresaid repreef of curiosite / we shall not under stand
generally forbeden to make fair works and honest apparaille / For that is
leeful so that hit keep a good mean and namely in the things and works that
longen to gods service / In the which hit is nedeful to beware and to
eschew all corupte entente of vain Joye. and all falls affeccion and foul
liking of worlds vanite. so that the virtuous mean of suffysaunt honest
pass not in to the excess of vicious curiosite. And thus mykel suffyseth seid
of this matter at this time

Of the tornynge again of our lord Jhesu fro Egypt / Capitulum Vndecunum /
^^ (...).
AFter that Herod was deed and seven year were at end in the which our lord
Jhesus had dwelled in Egypt the aungel of our lord appiered to Joseph in his
sleep / and badde that he should take the child and his mother / and god in to
the land of Israel / For they were deed that soughten y^ child to slay / And
he anon rose up / and with the child and his mother as the aungel badde turned
again in to the land of Israel / And when he came there / and herd / that
archelaus the sone of Herod reigned in that party. that was cleped Judea / he
dradde and durst not goo thither. but as he was efte boden of the aungel in his
sleep. he went to the Country of Galylee in to the Cite of Nazareth /

Here may we see in the coming again of Jhesu as hit was in his going said
dread and disease meddled with comfort and ease / For what time they being in
strange land herd of the death of their enemies. and that they should come
again in to their own land. no doubt. but yt it was great comfort and
hope of ease. but taking head therewith to the hard trauaylle by the way /
And after when they comen in to her own land in hope of pees. tidings of a
new enemy and for dread of him abyden for to eschew his Country / there was
discomforte and disease. and all to our lord as hit is said / Lord Jhesu
thou fair young child thou art lord and king of heaven and earth / what
disease and what trauaylle suffredest thou for onre sake / and how soon thou
beganst / Sothely well spoke the prophet in your person when he said thus /
I am poor and in diverse trrauaylles fro my Pauper sum ^go
first yongthe / Sweet Jhesu how yedest thou / or was carried all that long
and hard way / and namely thorugh that horryblae deserte passing over the
read see / and also the flode Jordan in so tendyr age / For as hit semyth. this
again coming is more trauayllous and more noyous to the and to thy leders /
than was thy first going. For why that time thou were so lytyl that y^
myghtest easily be borne in harms / but now thou art elder and more waxen as
in the time of seven year thou may not so / and goo mykel may thou not for
tendyr age. and to ride art thou naught used: Sothely hit seems that this
trauaylle al oonly that we speken now of were suffysau^t unto full rede^pcion
for mankind / Ferthermore as to the process of their way: we may think: that
what time they come toward the end of that deserte. there they fou^den De
J^ha^ne baptista
John Baptiste. the which that time had begone there to live in deserte
penance doing thou it so were that he had no syn^e penance worthy. for as it
is said yt place of Jordan in the which John baptized is that same place
whereby the children of Israel wenten dry foot when they comen by that deserte
out of Egypt / and that nigh that place in deserte John lived in penance.
wherefore hit is lykely that Jhesus and his mother founden him there / And that
they maden great Joye and myrthe ghostly coming together. And no wonder / for he
was an excellent and a worthy child fro his birth / He was the first
heremyte: and the begyn^ynge of Relygious living in ye Nota (...)
new law / He was clean maiden and grettest precher after criste / He was a
prophet and a precious and glorious martyr: wherefore we devoutly worshyppynge
and honourynge him take we our leave at him at this time / and goo we forth to
our lord Jhesu and his mother in the forsayde way. After they were passed the
flo^^ Jordan / then come they ferther more to the house of our ladies co^ya
Elyzabeth where they weren specially refresshyd / and maden together a great and
lykyng feste / And there Joseph herynge that Archelaus reigned after his fader
Herod in the country cleped Judea by bidding of the angels as it is said
before went with the child and his mother in to the cite of galylee cleped
Nazareth / and there they dwelled as in her own home ledyng a simple and a
poor life together. but in that great ghostly richesse of charity. Loo thus is
the child ihs brought out of Egypt. and than as we may think the systers of
our lady and other kynnes folk and fre^des come^ to hem. welcomyng hem home
and vysytyng hem with presents yeftes as it was need to them. that fou^den her
own bare household. Also among other we may specially have in mind that
Johan Euangelyst came with his mother Or Joha^ne euangeli^^^
our ladies sister. to visit and see Jhs. y^ which Johan was that time a
boute five year old. For as it is wryte^ of him / he deyde y^ year fro the
passo^n of our lord lx. and seven. that was the year of his age four score and
xviii. So that at the passion of crist he had in elde one and thyrty year /
And Christ him self xxxiii or lytyl more / And so at this again coming of
Jhesu that was then seven year old Johan was five year old and as he was
after among other chose^ Apostles and discyples specially beloved of our
lord Jhesus / so it is lykely that in this time of their chyldhode he was
more chere than other / and as most special pleyser to Jhesu. Fro this time
in to the time of xii. year of Jhesus age / the gospel makes no mind of the
child Jhesu Netheles it is written and said that there is yet in that place a
well whereof the child Jhesus fette often sythes water to his mother / For that
meke lord refused not to do such low seruyces to his mother / and also she
had none other servant / All her living was in meekness and in pouerte. to
our ensample to follow him

Amen /
How the child Jhesus was left allone in Jheru salem Capitulum xii


When the child Jhesus was twelve year old. and his dear mother with Joseph
went in to Jherusalem / for the feste day that last eight days. after the
bidding and the custom of the law / he went also with them in that tendyr
age traueylyng all that long way before seid to honor and worship his fader
of heaven in his rest days as reason would / For there is sovereign love between
the rader and the sone / Netheles there was more inward sorrow of heart and
compassion to the sone of y^ vnworshyppyng of his fader that he saw in doing
of many manner sins / then^e was onyioye without forth in y^ pomp and
sole^pnyte of that feste. but so stood he with his pare^tes in the time of that
feste keeping the law as mekely as another of the poor people. till what time
y^ fest days were fulfilled and ended / and the^^e after that his pare^tes
were gone homeward: he dwelled still there in Jerusalem hem vnwytyng / Now take
we here good entente as we were present in all that is here spoken of. for
this is a full devout matter and a profitable to us: as it is said before. The
cite of nazareth where our lady dwellid was fro Jherusale^ y^ space of. ^x.
mile. and. xiiii. or there about. and so b^felle that his mother our lady and
Joseph token diverse ways homeward / and what time they comen together at even
where they hadden set to be herberowed / our lady seenge Joseph without the
child that she supposed had gone with him: asked of him where was the child.
and he said that he wist never for he wender as he said: yt she had lad him
with her. and therewith she breast on weeping and with great sorrow said Alas
where is my dear child. for now I see that I have not well kept him and anon
she began to goo about in the euentyde as she myt honestely fro house to house
asking / Saw ye out of my sone / Saw ye out of my sone. uneaths myt she
feel her self for sorrow and care of her sone. And the sely old man Joseph
followed her algate weeping. and what time they hadden long souten and fou^den
him not / what rest hope we they hadden in that nyt / and namely the mother that
loved him most tendirly Sothly no wonder though they hadden no comfort al
thou her friends comforted hem as they myten For it was not a little loss to
lose Jhesu / wherefore here we may have resonably great compassion of the great
anguysshe that our ladies soul is now in for her sone / She was never in so
great sorrow fro the time that she was borne. and also here may we learn what
time tribulaco^ns and anguisshe fallen to us not to be heavy or mykel
distourbled thereby / sithen god spared not his own mother / as in this party /
For he sustreth generally tribulacions to fall to them that been his chose^.
and so they ben token of his love / and to us it is expediente to have hem for
many skylles: Then^e our lady sorry as it is said for she might not find her
sone. that night closed her in her chamber / and took her to prayer. as to the
best remedy in that caas saying in this manner. Almighty fader of heaven full of
mercy O^^^io ^^i^
and of pity / hit lyked you. and was your will to give me your dear sone.
but loo now fader I have lost him. and wot not where he is / but thou that
know all thing / tell me and show me where my sweet sone is / and give
him to me again Good fader take heed and behold the sorrow of my heart. and
not my great necligence / For I knowleche well that I have offendyd in this caas
/ Nevertheless for it is fall me to be Ignorau^te / ye for your great goodness
give him to me ageyn / for I may not live without him / And thou my sweet sone
Ihu where art thou now / or how is it with the / and where art thou now
herberowed / Lord whether thou be goon up in to heaven again to thy fader / For
I wot. well that thou art very god and gods sone / But why then^e would
thou not tell me before / Also I wot well that thou art very man of me borne
/ And here before I kept the. and bare ye in to Egypt fro the malice of
Herod that sought the to slay. But now whether any wicked man has aspyed the.
the fader of heaven Almighty he keep the. and shylde the fro all peril and
malice Dear sone tell me where thou art / that I may come to the or else thou
come to me / and foryeue me this neclygence at this time / and I behete that it
shall never efte befalle me. for how this is befalle I wot never. but thou
know that art my hope. my life. and al my good. without the I may not live
In this manner and by such words as we may deuoutely suppose. all that night
the mother cared and prayed for her dear sone. After upon the morrow erly Mary
and Joseph soughten him by diverse other ways that ^a^den to Jherusalem. and
ferthermore soughten him besely among her friends and kynnesme^ / but they
myte not here of him / wherefore his mother was so sorry that she myte in no manner
be comforted / But the third day after when they comen in to Jherusalem. and
soughten him at the Temple / there they found him sittynge among the
doctoures of law. heryng hem ente^ty^ly. and asking hem questions wisely. And
anon as our lady had ye sit of him. she was as glad as she had be turned
tro death to life and therewith knelynge down thanked god inwardly with wepinge
Joye / And also soon as the child Jhesus saw his mother: he went to her /
And she with unspeakable Joye clypped him in her arms and kissing him often
sythes. and holding him in her barme. rested a while with him for tenderness.
till she had take spyryte / and then she spoke to him and said. Dear sone
what have you done to us in this manner / For lo thy fader and I with great
sorrow have sought the al these three days. And then^e he answerde ageyn. and
said / And what eyleth you to seche me / know ye not well that it behooves me
to be occupied in tho things that longen to the worship of my fader. But these
words they understood not in yt time. And then^e said his mother. Sone will
thou not goo home ageyn with us / And he mekely answering said: I will do as
ye will that I do. and as it is pleasyng to you. And so was he subget to hem
/ and went home again with hem unto their Cite of Nazareth. In this forsaid
process of Jhesu what hope we that he did / or where. or in what manner he
lived in tho three days. we may suppose that he went to some D^ (...)
hospytale of poor men. and there he shamefastly prayed and asked herborow and
there ete and lay with poor men / as a poor child / And some doctoures
sayen that he begged in those three days. But thereof little force / so that we
follow him in Nota
parfyte mekenes and other virtues / For beggynge without forth / but there be
a meke heart within forth is little worth / as to the perfeccion Ferthermore in
the forsaid process we may note and learn three notable things to us / The
first is that he that will perfytely love god / shall not dwell among his
flesshely friends and kynnesmen / but he must leave hem and goo fro hem. In
token whereof the child Jhesus left. his own dear mother what time he would
give entente to the ghoostly works of his fader. And also when he was sought
among his friends and kynnesmen / he was not founden there in that time / The
second is. that he that ledeth ghostly life wondre not much ne be not
discomforte over heuely / though he be sometime so dry in soul / and as void
of devotion / as he were forsake of god / For this manner befell to gods mother
as it is said before wherefore be he not in dispeyre there by / but seche besely
he Jhesu in holy medytacions and good works / and specially in devout prayers
/ and he shall find him at last in due time / The third is / that a man
follow not tomoche his own wit / or his own will / For our lord Jhesus
after he said that he behooves to be occupied to tho things that longen to his
faders worship. After he left that propir will / and followed his parents
will going forth with. them fro the temple home in to Nazareth / and was
subgette to them / And this is specially nedeful to Relygyou se folk to
follow by true obedyence to their souereynes / And also here have we great
ensample of meekness in our lord Jhesu / whereof we shall treat more plainly
in the Cha pytre that next follows

what manner of living our lord Jhesus had / And what he did fro his twelfe
year unto the beginning of hisxxx.

year. Capitulum. xiii.
ERo the time that our lord Jhs was gone home to Nazareth with his pare^tes
when he was twelve year old as it is said before unto his thyrty year we find
naught expressid in scripture aute^tyke what he did / or. how he lived. And
that seems full wonderful. what shall we than suppose of him in all that time.
whether he was in so mykel ydelnes: that he did nout. or wroute nothing worthy
to be wreton and spoken of. God shyelde. and on that other side if he did and
wrought. why is it not wreton as other deeds of him ben Sothely hit seems
merueyllous and wonderful: But netheles if we would take hereto good ente^te.
we should mow see yt as in naught doing he did great things and wonderful
For there is no thing of his deeds or time of his living without mystery
and edyficacyou. but as he spoke and wroughte vertuosly in time. so he held
his pees and rested and withdrewe him vertuosly in time / wherefore he yt was
sovereign master and came to teache virtues and show the true way of ever
lastyng life. he began fro his yongthe to do wonderful deeds and that in a
wonderful manner and unknown and that was never ere herd before. that is to
say showing him self in that time as ydel and uncunning and abiecte in the
syghte of men Nota p^^ l^no (...)
in manner as we shall say after not. fully affermyng in this or other that we
may not openly preue by holy write or doctoures approved / but devoutly
ymagynyng to edyfycacyom and styrynge of devotion: as it was said in the
prohemye of this book at beginning. And so we suppose that our lord Jhesus
(...) Jhesu
in that time withdrewe him fro the company and feli ship of men and. went
often sythes to the synagoge as to the church. And there was he mykel occupied
in prayer / but not in the highest and most worshipful place. but in the lowest
and secret place. and after in time wha^ he came home. halpe his mother / And
also perauenture his suppossed fader Joseph in his craft coming and going
among men. as he knew not men. All that knewe^ him of ye common people that he
dwell led among and seen so fair and semely young man doing no thing that
was in to praysyng or magnifyeng of his name wondered gretely of him. Namely as
the Gospel says of him when he was young / and of twelfe year age / Jhesus
profyted in age. in wisdom and in grace tofore god and man that is to say as
in the sight and opinion of men. But now when^e he was of more age in to the
time of his thyrty year he showed no deeds of co^mendaco^n outward. wherefore
men scorned him. and held him as an ydeote / an ydel man and a fool / And so
it was his will to be hold as unworthy and abject in to the world for our
sauacion as. ye prophet speaks in his person thus. I am a worm and not a
man / repreef of ^go snm bermis it non homo
men / and abieccion of people / But here may we see that he in that abiecco^n
as it were not doing. did a full virtuous de de of worthy commending / And
what was that / Sothely that he made him self foul and abiecte in the sight of
other and hereof had he none need / but we had this need / For sothely as I
trow in all our deeds there is no thing greter or harder to fulfille than is
this. wherefore as me thinks that man is come to the highest and hardest degree
of perfeccion / the which of full heart and true will without feynynge has
overcome him self / and maystreth the proud styryng of the flesh. that he
will leth not to be in reputaco^n of men / but coueyteth fully to be despised
and hold a foul unworthy and abject / For this is more worthy and more to
commend than a man be passyngly strong. and a co^querour of Cytees and
lands. as Salamo^ Melior es^ paciensvi to forti
witnessyth. wherefore till we come to this degree of perfecco^n we shall hold
our self as full imparfyte. and all that we do ne as naught to acounte / For
fythen in sothenesse all we done but as unworthy sernauntes what time that we
done the good that we owe^ to do as god him self witnessyth. till the time
that we come to this degree of abiecco^n and parfyte repreef of our self. we ben
not set sadly in troth. but rather in vanyte as ye Apostle openly shows in
these words. who so holds him self in his own reputacion as ought worthy
Qaise (...) is^m^^ all quid esse
sythen in sothenesse he is as naught. he begyleth and deceyueth him self. And
so as we said before our lord Jhesus lived in this manner and made him self
abiecte and as unworthy to the world / not for his own need / but for to teache
us y^ true way of perfecco^n / wherefore if we learn it not. we may not be
ercused. For it is an abhomynable thynce. to see him that is but a worm and
worms mete to come. for to hye him self by presumpcion and lift up him self
as ought. when that the hye lord of mageste so meked him self by abieccion and
lowed him self as naught. and that did he naught by feyuyng but as he was
sothely meke and mylde in heart. Lo also with out symulacion he lowed him self
in all manner of makenes and abieccion in the sight of other. fulfyllyng first
in deed y^ he taught after by wordewha^ he badde his disciples tolerne of him
for to be meke and mylde in heart. And in so mykel he (...) mi (...) sum
lowed him and auau^tised him self that also after he began to preche and to
speak so hye things of the godhede. as the gospel tells and to wyrche
miracles and wonders. yet the Jews setten naught by him / but despised and
scorned him saying: what is he this / is not he the wryghtes sone of Joseph And
also in the deuyls name he casts out devils: and many such other despytes
he suffered patiently and mekely making so there thorugh a sword of meekness /
therwyth to slay the proud adversary the deuylle of hell. and if we will see
how myghtely he gyrde him self with this sword of mekenes after the byddyng of
the prophet. let us take good head to al his deeds and we shall see in them
algate showed great mekenes as we may see if we have in mind in all the
process that is said yet hyder to / And also herafter shall be showed more and
more in to his hard death. And moreover after his resurrecco^n and at his
vpstyenge to heaven / and yet here to more over at last day of dome when he
shall sytte in his mageste king and domes man of all the world / yet shall he
show his souerayn mekenes to his creatures his brethern by these words. As
long as ye dyden almesdedes to these my loved brethren / ye dydeu it to me /
And why hope we that he showed so mykel and loved pryncipally this virtue of
mekenes: Sothly for he knew well that as the begyn^ynge of al syn^e is pride /
so the fundament of all good and of sauacion is mekenes. without the which
fu^dament the byldynge of all other virtues. is in vain. And therefore if we
trust of maydenhede of pouerte or of any other virtue or deed without mekenes.
we ben deceived. And for as mykel as he taught and showed us in what manner this
virtue of mekenes shall be geten that is to say by de spysynge and abiecco^n of
a man him self in his own sight and also in other men^es syghte / and by
contynuel doing of low and abiecte deeds. Therefore us behooves to love and
use these means if we will perfytely come to that hye virtue as saint Bernard
says in diverse places: God give us grace Bernard in epistol^ ^d canoni cu^
regula rem
to get it parfytely as it is said. For sothely I that write this knowleche me
full far there fro. And thus mykel at this time suffyseth spoken of this
sovereign virtue / But now to goo ageyn to our pryncypal matter of the myrroure
of ye blessed life of our lord Jhu / behold we there ye manner of living Nota
modu^ viue^di dn^i nostri Jhesu cu^ parentibus
of yt blessid company in pouerte and symplenes together. and how that old man
Joseph wroughte as he myt in his craft of carpentry. our lady also with the
dystaf and nedel / and there with making her mete and other office doing that
lo^geth to household as we may think in diverse manners And how our lord Jhs
mekely halpe hem both at her need / and also in leyeng of ye board making the
beds and such other besynes gladly and lowely mynystrynge. and so
fulfyllynge in deed that he says of him self in the gospel that man^es sone
came not to be served. but to serve. Also we may think how they three eten
together every day at one lytyl board. not precious and delicate metes: but
simple and sobre as was oonly nedeful to sustenau^ce of the kind. And after
mete how they speken to gyder. And also paraue^ture other while in her mete not
vain words or dissolute: but words of deuoco^n / and full of wisdom. and of
the holy ghoost. And so as they we^en fed in body / they were^ mykel better
fed in soul / And then^e after such manner recreacion in common / they wenten
to prayer by them self in their closettes. For as we may ymagyne they had no
great house. but a lytyl in the which they had three seuerynges. as hit were
three small cha^bres there specially to pra Nota (...)
ye and to sleep / And so may we think how our lord Jhs criste every night
after prayer gooth to his bed lowely and mekely showing in that and all
other needs to mankind that he was very man and hydynge his godhede fro the
fend / O lord Jhesu well may thou be cleped hid god / that would in all
this long time thus trauaylle and put to penance that most Innocent body
for our sake when the trauaylle of one night had suffysed to redemption of all
the world. But thy great love of man made the to do great deeds of penance
for him And so thou that art king of kings and almighty god with out end
that helpest all men in their* need / and yeuest thy go odes to all other
plentyuously as every condyco^n and state as Nota (...) ^r^ ca^na l^^ and ^u^
dal^^
keth / ye chose and reserved to your own person so great pouerte abiecco^n
and penance in wakyng. in slepyng. absteynynge etynge. and all your other
deeds doing / and in that so long time for our love. Lord god where ben they
now that. louen so mykel the lust. the liking and the ease of the flesh
that se then so besely precious and curious and diverse ornaments and
vanytees of the world. Sothely we that louen and desyren such things. we
learn not that in the scole of this master / For he taught us both by word
and by deed: meekness pouerte and penance* and chastysynge of the body / And
sythen we ben not wyser than he if we will not err / let us follow him that
sovereign master / that will not begyle* and that may not be begyled / And
also after the doctrine of his Apostle. haui^ge lyuelode and clothyng in these
be we apayed and that in need couenable / and not in superfluyte / And also in
all other virtuous living and exercyses before said follow to our power our
lord Jhesu that we may after* this wrechid life in penance come to his bliss
and the life everlasting in Joye Amen.

Of the Baptism of our lord Jhesu and way thereto / Capitulum xiiii.
AFter that nine and twenty year were complete / in the which our lord Jhesus
lived in penance and in ab^eccion. as it is said in the begyn^ynge of his xxx
year he spoke to this mother and said. Dear mother hit is now time that I goo to
gloryfye my fader. and make him known. and also to show my self to ye world.
and to wyrke the sauacion of man's sonle / as my fader has ordained and sent
in to this world for this end / wherefore good mother be of good comfort / For
I shall soon come again to the / And therewith that sovereign master of
mekenes knelyng down to his mother asked lowely her blessyng. And she also
knelynge and clyppynge him derworthly in her arms with weeping said thus / My
blessid sone as thou wolt / goo now with thy faders blessyng and mine And think
on me and have in mind soon to come again And so reuere^tly taking his
leave at his mother and also at his supposed fader Joseph / he took his way fro
Nazareth to ward Jherusalem / and so forth till he came to the water of Jordan:
where john baptized the people at that time / the which place is fro Jherusalem
the space of eyghte^ mile. And so the lord of all the world gooth all that long
way bare foot and allone / For he had yet none disciples gadred wherefore we
taking good entente by inward compassion of him in this journey. speak we to
him devoutly in heart thinking in this ^edi(...) ^^uot(...) nota(...)
manner. O lord Jhu ye that been king of all kings / whyder goo ye in this
manner alone / Good lord / where ben your Dukes. Earls. knights. and Barons.
horses: and harneys / chari ottes / and so^mers / and all other servants and
mynystres / that should be about you to keep you fro the common people in manner
of kings and lords. where ben the trompes and clario nes. and all other
mynstralsye and herbegers and purueyours / that should goo before / and al other
worshippes and pompes of the world. as we wretchyd worms vse^* Be not ye that
hye lord / of whose Joye and bliss heaven and earth is replenysshed / why
then^e goo ye thus symply alone and on that bare earth. Sothely ye cause is.

Sothely for our Reame is of thy world. and for we know not our self as
pilgrims and strangers. therefore we fallen in all these folyes and myscheues.
and so we vain men's sons louen and holden aldaye things that been vayn and

should not be tarried to run after you / but as wythouten byrthen we should goo
lyghtely and fully despise and set at nout all these wordly Rycheses and
goods But now speak we ferthermore of the baptysme of our lord Jhesu what time
that he come to the water of Jordan there found he Johan baptysynge sinful
men / and mykel people that was come thither for to here his predicaco^n / for
they helden him that time as Christ / And then^e our lord Jhesus among other
went to Johan / and prayed him that he would baptyse him with other. And Johan
beholdynge him and knowing him in spirit was adred / and with great reverence
said. Lord I should be baptized of the and thou come to me* and I^s answered /
Suffer now / For thus it falls and besemeth us to fulfille all ryghtwysnesse
/ As who says / Say not this now and bewreye me not or make me not know. for
my time thereof is not yet come. but now do as I bydde and baptyse me / ^ota
tees g^^du^ hu unlitati^:
for now is time of mekenes / and therefore I will now fulfille al manner
mekenes: Here says the gloss y^ mekenes has three degrees / the first degree
is. a man to be subget and lowed to his souerayn and not preferred or hyed him
self above him that is even with him in astate: the second is to be subget to
his even like in astate and not to be hyed or preferred above his vnderlinge /
The third and the souerayn degree of mekenes is to be subget and lowed to his
vnderlyng that is he that is less in astate tha^ he: and this degree kept our
lord ihs at this time wha^ he meked him and lowed him to Johan / and therefore
so he fulfilled ryghtwysnes and all the perfeccion of mekenes / And then when
Johan saw our lords will that must needs be do: he did as he ba^ and
baptized him ^ here. Now take we here good head how that hye lord of mageste
despoilleth him and ^^oth o^ his clothes as another simple man of the people:
And after he is plonged in that cold water. and in that cold time. as in
winter and al for our love and for our hele ordeynyng the sacrament of baptism
and wasshyng therwyth none of his own sins. f^^ he had none. but our
fylthes and our sins: and so wedding there ghostly to him holy church
generally. and all true souls specially. For in the feith of our baptism we
^en wedded to our lord Jhesu Crist. wherefore this is a great feste and a work
of great profit and excellence. for in this worthy work all the hole Trinyte
was openly showed in a synguler (...)an^r when ye holy ghoost came down in ye

seems me that I can. and yet now I may not hold my tongue unwisely and
without shame puttyng my self forth and showing me as wise and so ready to teache
and lightly to speak. but slow to here: And Criste what time he held his pees
so long / also hyde him self fro the knowing of men / whether he dradde ought
of vain Joye / what should he dread vain Joye that was in sothenesse the Joye
of the fader. But nevertheless he dread this not to him felf. but to us the
which he knew well had need to be adredde of that vain Joye. And in that he
spoke not with his mouth he taught us in deed / And that thing that he taught
after by word / now he spoke by ensample that is / Lerneth of me for I am
mylde and meke in heart / For of the yongthe of our lord in to this time of
thyrty year I here or read but lityl more: But now may he no longer be hyd.
sythen he is so openly showed of the fader: All these ben the words of saint
Bernard in sentence co^fermynge that was said before in the next chapitre how
that our lord Jhesus mekely held his pees in to this time for our doctrine to
flee presumco^n / and keep parfyte mekenes / the which virtue yet here in his
baptism he showed more growe^ than it was before by sovereign lowenes openly
showed to his servant making him worthy and great. and him self as unworthy
and abiecte. And also in a another point we may see his mekenes here grown.
for in to this time as it is said he lived lowely as in ydelnesse and
abiecco^n. but now he showed him self openly as a synful man. For Johan preched
to synful men to do penance and baptized them. And our lord Jhs came among
them / and in her sight was baptized as one of them /. and that was a sovereign
point of mekenes namely in this time wha^ he purposed to preche and show him
self as gods sone / for as by way of man^es reason he should have dread /
Then^e of that low deed leest thereby after when^e he preched he should have been
in less reputaco^n and dispysed as a synful man and unworthy. But therefore
left not he y^ was master of mekenes to meke him self in all manner of lowenes
to our doctrine and ensample. showing him self thing y^ he was not in to
despyte and abieccion of him self / But we in contrary Nota contra supe^ b^a^
manner shown our self that we ben not in to worship and praysynge of our self
/ For if there be any thing in us of virtue / that ought to be preysed. that
gladly we shown and maken know. but our defaultes and trespaces we helen and
hyden And yet be we in sothenes wyked and synful. And though N
it so be that we known our self as in our own sight unworthy and synful.
Nevertheless we would not behold so in the sight of other: And in that is our
mekenes far fro the parfyte mekenes of Jhesu as it was here. and before
showed And in all his deeds he showed it as that virtue that is most nedeful to
us / wherefore love we hit / and besye we us in all our deeds pryncipally to
keep hit / not dredynge thereby to be the more unable to profit of other. For
as he was in this time Nota
of his sovereign mekenes in vnderfongynge of his baptysme taken of his
servant showed by wytnes of the fader / and token of ye holy ghost very gods
sone So though we make us abiecte and low us never so mykel in our own syte
/ and in other men^es if we be able to profit to other / god will make us
known in time as hit is most spedeful to our own mede and to other men^es

Of the fasting of our lord Jhesu and his temptacions in deserte Capitulum
xv /
WHat time that our lord Jhesus was baptized as it is said before / anon went
in to deserte. and there upon an hill that was fro the place of his baptism
about four mile / and is cleped Quare^tana / He fasted xl. days and xl.
nytes not etynge or drynkyng / and as ye euangeliste Mark tells / his
dwelling was there with beestes / Now give we here good entente to our lord
Jhu / specially and to his deeds. For here he techeth us and yeueth us Ensample
of many great virtues. As in that yt he his solytary and fasteth: and prays
and waketh. and lies and slepeth upon the earth. and mekely is conuersau^t
with the beestes. Nota been processum dequatuor
In ye which process ben towched four things that lo^gen specially to
ghostly exercise and virtuous living / and wonder fully helping each other
together / that is to say. Solytary being. Fasting prayer and penance of the
body. by the which we Pu^^ta^ cordio.
may come best to yt noble virtue that is clennesse of heart. the which we owe^
soueraynly to desire. in as much as it is most nedeful to us / and
co^prehendeth in it self all other virtues in manner / that is to say. charity:
mekenes / patience / and all other virtues. And also it puts away vices.
for with vices or with defalute of virtues: clennes of heart may not sto^de and
last. and therefore in that book that is cleped Collaciones patrum it is said
that all the exercise of a monk should be pryncypally to get and have
clennesse of heart / and no wonder / for thereby a man shall deserve to see god
/ as christ him self witnessyth in the gospel saying thus / Blessid be the
clean in heart / Bernard
for they shall see god. And as saint Bernard says the clenner that a man is.
the nerer he is god / and the more clearly Primum Secundu^ Tercium Jeiunium ^
afflictio corporio:
sees him / wherefore to get and have this noble virtue / that is to say
clennesse of heart princypally helps besy and devout prayer. of the which
we shall speak after. But for as mykel as prayer with glotenye or with the lust
and the liking of the body and ydelnes is little worth / Therefore hit
behooves that there be therewith fasting and bodyly penance / and y^ with
discrecion. For bodily penance without discreco^n lets al good works. Also
for the keeping and fulfyllynge of all tho three for said things / helps
much the fourth / that solytary being For with much noise and troublynge
prayer will not well and devoutly be said: and he that sees and hereth many
things shall full hard escape uncleanness of heart and offense of conscience: for
often sythes death enters by our wyndowes in to the soul. wherfo^ thou that
wilt be knytte ghostly to our lord* Jhesu criste / and coueytest in clennesse
of heart to see god by ensample of him / goo in to a solytary place and in as
much as thou may saving thine astate flee the company of flesshely me^ /
Seche not by curiosite new knowleche and fre^shippes. Fylle not thyn eyes and
thyn eres with vayn fantasyes. For it was not without cause that holy faders
here before soughten deserts and other solitary places fer fro the common
co^uersacion of men / And also it was not for nout that they taughten and boden
hem that dwelleden in religious co^uersaco^n. that they should be blind* dee^
and dombe / and that may let and distourble rest of soul flee as venomous to
the soul. This solitary being and this fleyng as Bernard (...) say (...)*
says is more virtuously in soul than in body / that is to say yt a man in
his entencion in devotion and in spirit be departed fro ye world and men / and
joined so in spyryte to god* that is a spyryte and asks not solytary being
of body in manner and time: as specially in time of special prayer and also in
other time / of hem that owen by way of her degree by solytary as recluse and
some relygious / and therefore says the same saint that you that art among many
bodyly men thou may be solytary and alone ghostly if thou will not and love
not these worldly things that ye comynalte loves / and also if thou despise
and forsake tho thing that comynly al men desyre^. and taken / Also if thou
flee stryues and debates. and if thou feel not with sorewe thyn own harms /
and have not in mind wrongs done to ye for to be auengyd / And else though
thou be allone and solytary in body thou art not allone in soul truly. And
generally in what manner company of men that thou art co^uersau^t: beware
specially of thoo things: if thou will be truly solytary in spirit. that is
that thou be not a curious / and a besy sercher of other menes conuersacyon*or
else a presumtuouse and temerary demer of other men / This is saint Bernardes
sentence of solytary being / by the which we may understand that bodyly
solicitude suttyseth not with out ghostly / But for to have the ghostly the
bodily helps full much. putting away occasion without forth that myt draw
the ioule within forth fro the onynge and* knyttynge to her spouse Jhesu Crist
/ wherefore that we may so be knytte to him by grace / be we about with all
our will and might to tolowe him / that is to say in true solitary being. as
it is laid. and in devout prayer. in fasting and discrete bodily penance
doing. And ferthermore that his co^uersaco^n in deserte was Nota ^^ne
among bestes / we have ensample to live symply. and bear us lowely in what
congregation we ben. And there with to bear patiently / and suffer also hem
that semen to us as vure sonable and bestiall in maneres and in living / And
thus having in mind the manner of living of our lord Jhu Crist in deserte so
in penance tho xl. days. every christian soul ought to visit him other
oftymes by devout compassion. and specially in that time begyn^yng at the
Epiphanye when he was baptized in to xl. days after. in the which he fasted
and lived there as it is said. But now ferthermere as to his te^ptacion when
tho xl. days of his fasting were co^plete / our lord Jhs hongred / And De
^ep^^ci one d^i prima temptaco^ de gul^.
anon that falls temptour the fend that besy was a boute to know whether he
were gods sone. came to him and began to tempte him of glotonye / and said.
if thou be gods sone / say. that these stones be made and tornyd in to loves
/ But he might not with his treachery deceive him* that was master of truth.
For he answered him so wisely that neither he was overcome by the temptacion of
glotenye. and yet the adversary might not know that he desired. For neither
he denied ne affermed that he* was gods sone / but concluded him by an
Auctoryte of holy writ / And so have we here ensa^pie of our lord Jhesu to
withstonde the vice of glotenye For there must we begin / if we will
overcome other vices. De (...)
as the enemy comynly begyn^eth therwyth to assaylle hem that taken hem to
ghostly living / wherefore as it seems he that is ouercomen with that vice of
gloteny. that while he is feeble and vnmyghty to withstonde and overcome other
vices* as doctoures sayen in this place of the gospel* that but glotony be
first refrayned. man trauaileth in vain agenst other vices. Afterward the
deuylle took him up and bare him in to Jherusalem that was fro that place
about eyghte mile* as men sayen. and there he set him upon a pynacle of the
Temple where he tempted him of vain Joye / coueitynge to know as he did
before whether he were gods sone. But here was he also overcome by auctoryte
of holy writ. so that he lost fully his purpoos* in that he hurt him not as
man by pride / and him self was never the vyser of his godhede And here have we
ensample of patience co^siderynge the great benygnyte and patience of our
lord Jhesu / That suffered him self to be handeled and borne of that cruel
be that hated him / and all that he loved / And after that time as saint
Bernard says / the enemy seeing that he showed no thing of the godhede / And
supposing thereby that he was not god (...)
tempted him after as man at this thyrdde time / whenne he took him efte and
bare him again in to a full hye hille beside the foresaid hylle of Quare^tana as
the space of two mile: and there he tempted him of auaryce: And therewith of
ydola try / But therefore was he there openly repreued. and fully over come and
vaynquysshed: and overcome as diverse doctoures tellen that expowne^ more
plainly these temptacions / and this Nota de (...)
Gospel. And therefore we pass over the shortlyer here as we do in other
exposicions / standing pryncipally in meditacions as it was said at the
beginning of this book* If we take here good head / how our lord was handled
and tempted of the enemy: we should not wonder though we wretches ben often
sythes tempted / for not oonly he was tempted in these three times / But also as
saint Bernard says in other dyuer se times / as the Apostle says that he was
tempted in all manner temptacyou that longs to the infirmyte of man. without
syn^e. Ferthermore when the enemy was fully overcome and gone away angels comen
and serueden and mynystreden him Meditacio ^^uo^^
But now here take we good head* and behold we inwardly our lord Jhesu
etynge alone and the Angels about him / and think we deuoutely by
ymagynacion tho things that folowen herafter / For they ben full fair and
styrynge to deuoco^n And so first we may ask* what manner of mete it was /
that the Angels serueden him of after that long fast* Hereof speaks not holy
writ / wherefore we may here ymagyne by reason and ordeyne this worldly feast
as us lyketh not by error affermynge / but devoutly imagining and supposyng
and that after the common kind of the manhede / For yt we take heed and speak
of his might after the godhede there is no question / For it is no doubt /
that he might make what him list* And also have of tho that been and weren made
at his own will / But we shall not find that he used this might. and this
power for him self or for his disciples in her bodyly need / But for the people
to show his godhede we reden. that at two times he fed hem myraculously in
great multitude of a few loves and fysshes. but of his disciples is written
that in his own presence they plucked eeres of corn and eten hem for honger
as it shall follow herafter. Also what time he him self was weary of the way. and
satte upon the well speaking with the woman Samarytane we read not that he
made mete for to ete. but that he send his disciples in to the Cite to beg
her mete / and so it was not lyckly that in this time after his fast and bodily
honger he purueyed his mete by miracle fythen in this time he showed oonly his
manhede / and also there was no people* therefore to wyrche miracle to her
edificacion / as comynly he did / but oonly Angels were there present / And
sythen in that hylle was no dwelling of men ne mete ready dyt we shall.
suppose that Angels broughten him man^es mete all ready dyghte fro another
place. as it befelle to the prophet Danyel / For as holy writ tells what
time Danyel was put in the pytte of lions / and Abacuk a another prophet bare
mete to his repars in the field. gods Aungel took him up by the here of his
head and bare him fro then^ in to babylonye to Danyel for to be fed with that
mete / And after anon he was borne again / And so in that manner let us
ymagyne here and with ghostly mirth / as it were rehetynge our lord* Jhesu at
his mete / and also having in specially his dear mother / think we devoutly in
this manner. what time sathanas was reproved as a falls temptour. and utterly
driven away / holy Angels in great multitude come^ to our lord Jhesu after
his vyctory / and falling down to y^ earth deuoutely honored him / and
salued him as their lord and Almighty god. And our lord benyngly and swettely
to ok hem up enclynyng to hem with his head. as hit were knowlechyng him self
very man / and in that somewhat less and lowed fro Angels. And then^e speken
the Angels and sayde^ thus Our worthy lord / ye have long fasted: And it is
now your time to ete: what is your will that we ordeyne for you And then^e
he said / goo forth to my dear mother / and what manner of mete she has ready /
bring to me / For there is none bodyly mete so liking to me as that is of her
dyghtynge. And anon two of them going forth. suddenly were before her* and
with great reverence gretynge her of her sone behalf told their message. And
so of that simple mete y^ she had ordained to her self and Joseph. the Angels
token with a loof and a to well and other necessaryes. and broughten hit to
Jhesu / And perauenture there with a few small fysshes that our lady had
ordained then^e as god would / and so therwyth the Angels coming spradden the
towel upon the ground and leiden bread thereon. and myldly stoden and sayden
graces with our lord Jhesu* abiding his blessyng and till he was set. Now
take go Vide solitary ^t resluse
od entente here specially thou that art solytary / and have in mind why thou
etest thy mete alone as without man^es teliship the manner of this mete / And
how lowely our lord Jhesus sytteth down to his mete on the bare ground. For
there had he neither bancquerre ne quysshen: and take heed how N
curteysly / and how sobirly he takes his mete / notwithstondynge his honger
after his long fast / The angels serueden him as her lord. perauenture one of
bread: another wine: another dyt fysshes. some songen in the stead of
mynstrelsy that sweet song of heaven: and so they reheteden and cou^forted her
lord as it longen to them with mykel Joye meddled with compassion This teliship
have thou though thou see hem not when thou etest allone in thy celle if thou
be in charity / and specially when thou have thy heart to god as ye owe to have
after the bidding of the apostle. the which says to us that whether we eten
or drynken or any other thing do / all we shall do in the name of our lord
/ the which name Jhesus we shall algate bliss and thank him in heart / have
we mykel have we lytyl / have we good / have we badde / and so ete our mete
though we ben alone. as though we seen bodyly the blessed Angels that been
present ghostly / And here with having inward compassion of our lord Jhesu
and beholdynge in mind him that is Almighty god sovereign lord and maker of
all the world that yeueth mete to all flesshely creatures. so meked and in
manner neded to bodyly mete / and therewith etynge as another erthely man /
mykel owe we to love him and thank him / and with a glad will take penance
/ and suffer disease for him that so much has suffered for us / Ferthermore
as to the process when our lord Jhesus had eten and said grace. that is to
say thanketh the fader in his ma^hede of that bodily refeccion / He badde the
Angels bear ageyn to his mother that was left tellyng her that he should in
short time come to her again. And when they hadden do as he badde: and were
come again that was in full short time. he spoke to all the Angels that weren
there and said: God again to my fader and your bliss and reco^mendeth me to
him and to all the Court of heaven For yet it behooves me to do my pylgremage
here in earth a while / and a none therwyth they falling down to the earth. and
deuoutely asking his blessyng. after he had blessed them wenten up ageyn to
heaven tellyng there these tidings of his gracious vyctory. And thereof was all
the blessed Court reioysed and fulfilled in myrthe and thanking of god. And
thus and in this manner we may think and ymagyne the forsaid process to
styrynge of our devotion as by way of meditacion in the which process ben

hylle / and came to Jordan / Johan Baptiste as soon as he saw him come toward
him with his finger putting toward him showed him and said / loo the lamb of

saw the holy ghost rest what time I baptized him Afterward also a another day
when Johan had showed him as he did first. Andrewe and Peter with other
disciples / speken with him / and hadden a beginning of his knowleche as Johan

the way toward Galilee till he came to his mother at Nazareth whom we shall

had the syghte of him / no wonder was though she was glad and ioyeful in. so
mykel that there may no tongue tell* wherefore anon she rose and clippynge and

sauf to her / But there with beholding his face lene and pale. she had great
co^passo^n / and he ayenward reverently enclynynge did her worship as to his
mother. and also to Joseph as to his trowed fader. And so dwellid he with them

How our lord Jhesus began to teache and gadre disciples Capitulum. xvi
AFter that our lord Jhesus was come home again to Nazareth fro his baptism
and his temptacion. as it is said. he began a lytil and a lytil to show him
self and to tech pryuely and in party / For as openly and fully we read not
that he took upon him thoffyce of prechynge all that year following / that is to
say unto that time that he wrought the first miracle at the weddyng that was
that self day a twelve month that he was baptized: And though he or his
disciples precheden in the mean time other while. Nevertheless it was not so
fully nor so customably done before that Johan Baptiste was taken and
emprisoned: as after. And in that he gaf us ensample of a wonderful mekenes.
when touching thoffyce of prechynge he gaf stead to Johan yt was mykel less
and with out comparison more unworthy than he / And so we may see that he
began not with boost and blowynge as many done but with meekness lytyl and
lytyl softely. wherefore upon a sab botte day when he was come in to the
synagoge as he was wont to do with other as in ye church of Jews. he rose
up for to read in manner of* a mynyster or a Clerk. And when there was take him
the book of the prophet ysaye. he tornyd to that pace where it is written and
so he read in this manner The spyryte of our lord has rested upon me.
wherefore he has anointed me. and for to preche to the poor. he has se^te me
and cetera. And then^e when he had closed the book and taken it to the
servant. he sat down and then^e he spoke ferthermore This day is this
scripture fulfilled in your eres. Now take heed of him / how mekely at
begyn^ynge he took upon him y^ office of a reder as it were a simple clerk /
first with a benign and lowely chere redynge / and after expownyng it me kely
of him self / and yet not openly expressyng or menyng him self when he said.
this day is fulfilled this scripture. as who seith / I that read this this day
/ am he. of whom it speaks / And the eyes of all that were in the Synagoge
were set be sely in him / And all they wondered of these words of grace that
yeden out of his mouth. And no wonder. for he was soueraynly fair and also
most eloquente / As David says of him also / Thou fair in shappe passing the
children of me^ Specio^us ^o^^a pre (...)s homi number
and grace is showed in thy lyppes. Ferthermore also our lord Jhesus besyenge
him about our sauaco^n began to clepe and gadre to him dysciples: and so
he cleped Peter and Andrew three times / First time when he was about y^ water
of Jordan as it was said before / and then^e they come^ somewhat in De quarto
vocacione habetur Jo. po. cao luce quin to. capo
to his knowleche / but they followed not him / The second time he cleped them
fro the ship when they were^ about to take fysshe as luke tells: But
then^e though they herden his doctrine and followed him / Nevertheless they
soughten at that time to torn again to their propre goods. The third time as
Mathewe tells / he cleped them fro the ship / when he Mathei quarto et
Marc. prio
said to them / Comes after me / For I shall make you fysshers of men / And
then^e leften they her nets and ship and fader and followed him: Also in y^
two last times he cleped James and Johan as in y^ same place is made mind of
hem with Peter and Andrew. Also specially he cleped John fro the brydale as
saint Jerome says / but that is not expressyd in the text of the gospel.
Also specially he cleped Philip / and also in another place Matthew the
publicane. But the manner of clepyng of the remenau^t is not expressly written.
sauf that luke makes mind of the twelve apostles chosen. and names hem all.
Now take we here good intent to the manner of him in this clepyng and gadryng
of his dicyples / and of his conuer sacion with hem / how lowely he speaks to
them. and how homely he shows him self to them / drawing them to his love
wythinforth by grace. and without forth by deed famyliarly ledyng hem to his
moders house. and also going with hem often to her dwellynges / techyng and
enformynge hem / and so in all manner being besy about hem / and with as
great cure as ^
the mother has of her own sone. In so mykell that as is written. saint Peter
told. what time he slepte with hem in any place. it was his custom to rise up
in the night hem slepyng And if he fond any of them vnhyled * preuely and
softely hyled him again. For he loved hem full tenderly knowing what he would
make of hem as though so were they were me^ of rude and boystous conditions and
of simple lygnage. Never theles he thought to make hem princes of the world
and chy^etayns of all Christian men in ghostly bathayll and domesmen of other.
Here also let us take heed of what manner people began the feythe and the
ground of holy church. as of such simple fysshers / pour men and unlearned.
For our lord would not chese her to great Clerks and wise men. or mighty men
of the world. lest the great deeds that should after be done by hem might be
aretted to her wordynesse / But this he reserved and kept for him self / as it
was reso^ showing that only in his own goodness and might and wysedom / he
boughte us and saved us / Blessed be he Jhesus without end

Of the miracle done at brydal tornyd water in to wine Capytulum xvii
IT befelle that day twelve month yt our lord Jhesus was baptized as it is
said there was made a brydale in the country of Galylee in a place that was
cleped y^ chane / of the which brydale there is doubt whose brydale it was.
But we at this time shall suppose after the common opinion that it was John
euangelyst as saint Jerome also tells in the prologue of the gospel of john.
at the which brydale our lady Jhu^s mother was as she that was the eldest and
most worthy of the three systers. And therefore she was not bydden nor cleped
thither as other strangers weren / but she was there in her sisters house homely
as in her owen house ordeynyng and mynistryng as maystres thereof. And that we
may vndstande by three euydences of the process of y^ gospel. First by that the
gospel says first / that the mother of Jhein was there / and after that Jhesus
and his discyples weren cleped or bidden thereto. And so as we suppose it befell
yt what time our ladies sister Mary salome y^ wife of zebedee shapte to wedde
her sone John. she yede before to our lady to Nazareth that was fro y^ Chane
about four mile. saying that she would make a brydale to her sone John / And
so then our lady went with her to ordeine therefore certain days before
So that when other ghestes were bid / she was there all ready and homely be
fore. The Second euydence is that she knew defaute of wine. wherefore it
seems that she satte not at that mete as other ghestes that were beden. but
that she yede about mynystrynge as one of them that delyuerden mete and drink
and other necessaryes / wherefore she perceived by time and saw the defaulte of
wine / And told preuely her sone thereof / for help and remedy / and that
might she not have do if she had set among other wymen but she had risen
fro the board that is not semely to be and also it is not to leave that she that
was virtuously shamfaste. sat by her so ne among men. wherefore it follows that
she satte not as a gheste. but mynystred as it is said before / The third
euydence hereof is / that she bad the servants for to goo to her so ne / and
that they should do what that he badde them do / And so it seems that he was
over hem: and that the brydale was governed by her / and therefore she was besy
that no default were there at. wherefore we may take heed and understand the
manner of this brydale and the process of the miracle thereat done thus. First
we shall behold our lord Jhesu etynge there among hem as another common man /
and that sitting in the lowest place and not among the great and most
worshypful ghestes abouen as we may onderstande by this process / For he should
after teache this lesson of the gospel. whanthow art beden to the brydale or to
the feste. sytte and take thy stead in the loweste place / And for as mykel as
he would first do in deed that he should after teache by word. therefore he
would not take the first and the pryncipall sete in manner of proud men / but
rather the lower among simple me^ Here with also behold our lady his mother yt
al thing were well and couenably done. telling the servants and the
mynystres how they should serve and whereof. And so after when it drowe toward
the end of y^ feste / they comen to her and saiden there is no more wine. And
she a^swered abides a litil and I shall get you to have more / And she went
out of the chamber in to the hall to her sone Jhesus that satte at bordes
end nyhe y^ cahmbers door / and rownyd him in the ere and say / My dear sone
they have no more wine. and she this our sister is pour. wherefore I ne wete
where we shall have more and Jhesus a^swered and said / what is y^ to me and to
the woman. This seem the an hard and a bostous answer to his mother / But
neuerthe less it was said in mystery and for our ductryne and techynge as
saint Bernarde says. and as it shall be told after the process / But of this
hard and strange answer as to semynge his mother was not distourbled ne in
despeyre / but fully trusting in his great godenes and benignite she went
again to y^ servants and said to them / Gooth to my sone Jhesus and what so
ever he says and byddeth you do / does and then at the bid dyng of our lord
they fylleden the stenes that were full of water / And anon at his blessyng all
y^ water was tornyd in to wine / And then he badde them draw thereof / And
bear to the archetryclyne. that is to say the most worthy person of all the
hgestes in that house. In the which byddyng we may see first the dyscrecyon of
our lord. in that he sent that wine first to the most worshypfull man. Also
we may see here by that our lord satte fere fro him in that he said. Bears
hit to Archetryclyne. And so sythen he satte in the hygeste place it seems
that our lord satte in the lowest place / as it was said before. And when he
had tasted the wine and preysed it / and he and other dronken thereof. the
mynystres that knewen how it was made tolden openly the miracle / And then
his dyscyples byleueden in him more sadly as for the first miracle that they
seen done before hem / And so in that Jhesus showed his bliss and his godhede
Afterward when the ^este was al done / our lord Jhesus called John by himself
and said / Leave this woman that thou have taken to thy wife / and follow me. For
I shall bring the to a better and more parfyte wedding than this is. And a^one
without more Johan left his wife there. and followed Jhesus. In this foresaid
process we may not many things to our doctryn and edificacion First in that
our lord Jhesus would come and be present attebrydale and weddyng he showed us
that matrymony and flesshely wedding is leefful and ordained of god / but in
that he called Johan there fro. he does us to understand that ghoostly
matrymony is mikel more better and perfect and worthy. Also in that hard
answer and strange as to semynge that he yaf to his mother when he said / what
is that to me and to the woman as saint Bernard says. he taught us that been
relygious and have forsake the world. not for to be to besy and have to great
care about our flesshely parents. so that their need let not our ghostly
exercise / for as long as we ben of the world so long we be t^ debt to our
parents. but after we have left it / and forsake our self / mykel more we be
free and delyuerd of y^ (...)
besinesse of hem. and so we find written that there came upon a time to an
hermit or a monk that had forsake the world and lived solytaryly in deserte
/ his owen flesshely brother prayeng him of his help in a certain need.
touching the world. and he bade him go to his other brother that was deed long
before And when he wondered of that bidding and said that he was deed as he
knew well / the monk answerde and said that so wash deed to the world. And so
thaught us our lord Jhsus that we that have forsake the world should not besy
about our pareutes and flesshely friends over that. that relygyon asks.
when he answered to his mother and namely to such mother saying. what is that to
me and to the woman Anoder understanding is in this words. the which cominly
doctoures tellen / and therefore we pass over at this time. Ferthermore we
have here techynge of patience and hope in the deed of (...)
our lady that left not for that strange answer as it is said before / And
so what time we callen to Jhesu for help at our need bodily or ghostly.
though we find it not anon but rather hardness and contrariete / we shall not
leave therefore to call upon him by good hope / till thorugh his mercy and grace
y^ unsavory water and cold of aduersite and penance be turned in to wine of
comfort and ghostly liking / After this miracle was done our lord Jhesus
wyllyng and purposynge so for the to wyrche and preche openly for the sauacion
of man / he went fro that place with his mother and his disciples in to
Capharnaum beside Nasareth leding his mother by the wey and following his
discyples / and besily heryng his words and his techynge / For he was not
ydell* but did and wroughte good or taught and spoke to edyfycacyon / And so
do we in

Of y^ excellent (his name y^ blessid be without end ame^ Srmon of our lord
Jhu^ made in y^ hylle / Caplm xviii
Whan^e our lord Jhu^s had chosen and gadred his disciples as it is said
before. willing to teache hem and inform hem the perfeccion of y^ new law.
he ladde hem up in to an hille that is called Thabor about two mile fro
Nazareth after the common opinion / and there he made to hem a long sermon
Augustinus de sermo^^ dni in mo^^^
and full of fruit / the which as saint austin says in the beginning of this
book that he made of that sermon it conteyneth all the perfeccion of Christian
living / For in that sermon he taught hem first which men of god ben
blessed and worthy to have his bliss / Also he taught hem the true manner of
prayer / of fasting / of Almesdede and other virtues longing to the parfite
life of man as the text of the gospel openly tells / and diverse doctoures
and clerks expounen it suffisau^tly. the which process we may pass over
here / for as mykel as it is written both in latin and in English in many
other places. And also it were full long process to touch all the points
thereof here as by manner of meditaco^n / wherefore we shall at this time specially
note y^ our lord began his sermon first ^o^ de^ p^^ ^ta^^
at pouerte doing us to that pouerte is y^ first ground* of al gostly
excercyse / For he that is ouerleyd and charged with temporell good and
worldly richesse may not freely follow Christ that is the mirror and ensample
of pouerte. namely he that has liking and his affecco^n under these worldly
goods. for he is not free. but thrall and as in bondage of hem. For of that
thing that a man loves inwardly and by affeccion* he is made wilfully*thrall
and servant. And therefore is the pour man blessid that is to say. he that
inwardly loves no thing but god. For in that he is knitte to god. as for the
more part. wherefore say the saint Bernard in a sermon. that pouerte is a great
fether Bernerdus i s^^: quarto de adue^t^
or a great wynge. thorugh the which man flees so soon in the kingdom of
heuene. For as to other virtues that folowen in this place of the gospel. the
mede of hem is behight for to come as in time that follows after / But to the
virtue of pouerte it is not only behygthe for to come: but as in time that is
now present it is yeuen of christ by y^ foresaid words at the begin^yng of his
sermon that been in these. Blessed be tho y^ ben pour in spirit. for her mede
is the kingdom of heaven. Lo he says not / her mede shall be. but as now her me
de is Also they that been not only pour* but pour in spirit b^ ^^
blessid / for therein stant the virtue of pouerte. and he is pour in spirit
that has lytil of the spirit of pride / that is common to mankind by the
first syn^e as a man is called pour worldly that has lityl of worldly goods.
But now leuynge this matter B
torn we us to conte^placion beholding our lord Jhu^ how lowely and mekely he
sits upon that hill. and his disciples about him. and with how lowely and
sad chere he speaks thoo words full of edificacion / and teched that nobel
lesson of sovereign perfeccion. and also how mekely and ente^tly his disciples
beholden his blessed face / and heren the sweet words / and setten hem besyly
in her mind. And so have they great Joye and ghostly liking in his speech
and in his sight / And specially as I hope they weren ^^
comforted in y^ nobel short prayer that he taut hem among other in that time
that is pater noster. ^ that for the great fruit (...)
that they felten therein / and also for the great trust and hope that they were
put in thereby / For as we may well suppose as to the first / that is the
fruit thereof. not only they understand it after the lettir. but also therewith
they hadden thorugh grace y^ ghostly understanding of each peticion thereof /
And sythen there in is contained the asking of all that us needs to the body
and to the soul / and that touching our temporel life in this world and the
life everlasting in a another world and al comprehendid in so short words: no
wonder thou they hadden great likinge and comfort in that prayer by the great
fruit that they tasted therein / And so haven al they that thorugh grace fele^
the ghostly fruit and the sweet taste thereof. Also as to the Second Secundu^
comfort in that prayer. that is trust and hope how might her trust and hope
be more stabled and strengthed / than to see him that al only knew. what was
nedeful and spedeful to hem to ask / and that might only give hit hem / and
teache hem the petycy on / by the which they might not err in her askinge /
nor fay le of her asking / And so he that was domes man made the lybelle in
her cause against the which he might not give his dome and his sentence. Also
he that was lord made the bille of his servants for to ask only thoo
things. that were need full to them and likyng to him for to grant / More
comfort might not be touching prayer and askyng in need. And also more over /
this comfort of this prayer was the more / For as mykel as next before in the
same place of that sermon he reproved the prayer of ypocrytes and other that
wern not worcester thy to be herd / And so was the medecin more confortable and
likinge. that the defaulte and sekenes was opened and told be fore / All this
comfort shall we find in this foresaid prayer Pater noster if we say hit
devoutly. and not in dedely syn^e. For our lord Jhu^s made not only this prayer
to his discyples that weren that time specially with him in that hille. but
also to us and al Christian men generally that should make their prayer to the
fader of heaven in his name in to the worlds end ^o^ (...) causa
But the more harm is. here is mykel people deceived that leven to mykel this
most worthy prayer and best / by singular de nocion in other private prayers /
or saying it without denocion / As we may see all day many men* and wymmen /
bering bedes with trillynge on the fingers and waggynge ye lips* but the
syghte cast to vanitees and the heart that only god knows as it is to dread
set more upon worldly things / Of ye which manner of people speaks our lord
god by the prophet and says thus / This people prays and honors me with
her lyppes. Populus hic labiis me honorat
but their heart is fer from me But for as mykel as this matere is spoken of in
many other tretees and books both in latyne and in english* and this prayer
sufficau^tly expouned therefore we passen over more shortly at this time hereof.
But ^o^ de ^^p^ ri^cia o^^^i on^^ Pa^^^ nos^^^
one thing touching this prayer* sothely I trow that whoo so will give his
entente for to say it with devotion and has an inward desire to the ghostly
understanding thereof setting his heart as mykel as he may when he says it both
in comin and in pryuate / he shall thorughe grace by process of time find
so mykel comfort there in. that there is none prayer made of man / that shall
be to him so sauery and so effectuell in what so ever need or caas he be
styred specially to pray for remedy and help to god. and so shall he find in
his soul when god will give his grace with great likynge diverse vnderston
dynge thereof most aperteyneth to his desire and that other than is written in
the common exposicion thereof or parau^^ur better than he can tell. But mykel
folk as servants and by red men have more will to pray for special mede
that they coueyten here than as true sons for the love and the plesyng of our
fader god of heaven / And so they setten more her lik^^ ge and besines in a
pryuate prayer made of man to our lady or to other saint of heaven. tha^ they
done this in general prayer made of god him self. the which without doubt is
most plesinge to him and most spedful to us. and therefore they ben deceived in
many manners / I speak not here of the sauter and the service in holy church.
Nevertheless other devout prayers made to god and to our lady and other
saints ben good to be said after that the devotion of men is stired to say
them in couenable time. so that they set not her affeccion the less upon
this most worthy prayer Pater noster: As mykell folk in the saying of other
private prayers setten all her intent and speken hem with great devotion / but
in the saying of the Pater noster they ben to necligent and rabben it forth
without devotion / and that makes often special mede temporel yt they hope for
to have by the saying of such private prayers / as to overcome their enemies
/ or for to be kept fro fire or water or sodeyne death. or other bodily perils
/ And that is a great folly to trust upon / by ye saying of any prayers. without
ritghwys living. And also men should not desire such special temporel medes.
but only as is the will of god that all only knows what is spedful to us /
and that without doubt shall get us most effectuelly of any other prayer the
Pater noster if it be said truly with devotion / and specially by that peticion
and askinge Fiat volu^tas tua. sicut in celo et in terra / that is to say Our
^ader in heaven / thy will be done in all thing as in heaven so in earth. And so
if it be best to us for to be kept fro fire or water or sodeyne death or any
other bodily peril with out doubt our fader of heaven god will give it us
after the foresaid peticion with rightwys linyng. and else not / say we never so
many private prayers / For as we read al day of diuer se martirs and saints.
that som^e were burnt. sum drowned and in other diverse manners put to
shamful death as to the world / and that was best to hem and encreace of her
Joye and bliss of heaven. wherefore it had been a great open folly to hem as we may
well were to have prayed for to be kept fro such bodily harms or perils and
as against sodeyne death. it is spedeful to many men for to have such death
shamful to man's syghte / As saint Gregory tells by Ensample of the prophet
Abdo that was woryed of the lion / that god purged of time here ryghtwys men by
such shamful death / For as holy writ Jus^us simo^ te ^occupatus fu^^it in
refrige^^^ ^^it
te witnesses sothely / the ryghtwysman if he be overcome by any manner of
bodily death / his soul shall be saved and be set in rest everlasting /
Nevertheless we prayen often and that lawfully to be kept fro sudden death. but
that is vnderston de that we be not combred with dedely sin therinne to deye
without repentance of heart and shryfte of mouth. and thereto as I hope is
most best and effectuel prayer the pater noster specially in the two last
petycyons and askinges thereof by the which we prayen almighty god fader of
heaven that he suf freth us to fall and to be combred with temptacyon of dedely
Et n^no^ i ducas in^^p ta^^on^
syn^e but that he keep us and delyuere us fro all wickedness And though it so
be that the matere of this worthy prayer be so plentiuous. and also the thesyre
of the wryther hereof were to speak more there of / Nevertheless for it is written
in so many other places as I hope suffysau^tly. and also for the great process
that follows after / we leave this matere at this time and all the fructuous
sermons that our lord Jhu^s made to his discyples in that hill before / going
down with him by devout contemplacion. and beholdinge how that after that
noble lesson taught in the hill as it was skillful for the high per feccion
thereof our lord Jhu^s came down with that meke t^lke of his disciples spekyng
also homely with hem by the way. and they as the chykens of the hen^e folowen
him with mikel ghostly liking coueytynge each before other to be ne^^ him and
here is virtuous and sweet words And after he was come down mykel people came
against him bringinge diverse se ke folk and many as the gospel tells by
process. the which al he full of mercy heled. and made hole both in body and
in soul And thus shotly we passen here over mykel process of tie gospel and
many chapiters of the foresaid book of bo^a^^u^^t for the litil edificacion of
hem as it seems nedful to simple souls / to y^ which this book is specially
written in englisshe as it has often be said here before / And so leuyng this
process in many places we shall only tell the notabylytees thereupon shortly
to edyficacion:

Of ye paletike man leide done in his bed by ye house heling (and heled of our

IN this gospel No^de i^i^mi ta^ibus corpo ralibus and spu^ alibus.
we have ensample and doctrine that often sythes bodily sykenes comes of
ghostely sikenes that is sin^e. and yt the helinge of ghostly sekenes is often
cause of bodyly hele. In that our lord first foriaf to y^ paletike his sin^es /
and after heled him of ye bodily palesye Also here we may see the great virtue
of true bilyue in y^ y^ the feith and the biliue of one man. helped and saves

ageinste sum heretics that helden the contrary opinion:

of Jhesus clothing as saint Bernerd says may be understand every meke
servant of god / the which in any virtuous deed yt he does owes to know
truly heart and openly knowleche by mouth that only god is principal doer
thereof / and naught he as the clothe heled not. but our lord Jhu^s that wered
that cloth

Of the Conuersyon of Mary Maudeleyne Captm xxii
OVre curteis lord Jhesus was prayed of Simon the leprose on a day to ete with
him / and thereto he granted gladly and came to mete as he was wont to do
oftsythes both of his owene curtosie and also for the love and the zele that he
had No^ de cu^^ al^tate^ dom (...) I^^^^
to the sauacyon of man^es sowles. for y^ wyche he was made man / for so etyng
with hem and benygnly comining with hem he drowe hem to ye love of him. Also
for as mykel as he made him self so pertitely pour that he took none pocession
of worldly gods for him self. as for his. therefore thru that love of pouerte
he that was ye mirror of mekenes what time that he was prayed or beden to
mete. took it for the time and the place mekely. and with curtesye / thanking /
and good will. And then it befelle that Mary Maudeleyne that parauentur of
time before had herd him preche. and thorugh touching of his grace was greatly
styred to compunction and to the fervent love of him: though hit were yet
preuely hid in her heart. when she herd and knew that he was at mete in the
house of the foresaid Simon. she was ferue^tly touched with sorrow of heart with
inforth for her sins: and also with. the brennynge fire of his love / that
she might no longer abide. but anon she went to that foresaid house where
Jhesus sat at mete. considryng that without him she might not be sauf. ne have
foryeuenes of her sins. and so she went bodily in to the house / And as she
had foryete her self taking none regard to ye gestes that there were at the
mete holding down her face and her eyes to the earth she let not till she
come to him that she sought. and inwardly No^ (...)
loved our lord Jhesu. And anon then^e she fell down to the ground prostrate
at his feet. and with great inward sorrow and shame for her sins spoke in her
heart to him. thinking as it were in this manner. My sweet lord I wot well
and truly knowleche / yt ye be my god and my lord. and that I have offendyd
your high mageste in many great offenses and trespaces in so mykel that I
knowleche sothely that my sins ben without nombre as the gravel of the sea
/ But for as mykel as I belyue that your mercy passes all thing Therefore I
wretchyd and synful come to you / and flee to your great mercy. forthynkynge
inwardly of that I have offendid and asking mercy and foryeuenes. And I behete
with all my heart ame^dement of my sins / And that I shall never to my power
for sake your obedyence. Good lord put me not fro you. and forsake not my
repentance. for other refute I wot well I may none have. and also I will not
have / For I love you soueraynly above all other. wherefore good lord forsake
ye not me / but punysshe ye me at your will. Nevertheless I ask algate mercy.
And here with with great turste of his mercy and inward affectyon of his love /
she kyssede his feet otfe. And sadly weeping and shedynge teres so thylke that
shwesshe his feet with hem And so it seems there by yt our lord Jhesus went
bare foot / After when she had well wept. with great dread of her unworthiness
that her here is should touch her lords fete / she wiped him with her here
deuoutely. For she borught no thing with her so precious to wype him with And
also she wyped hem with her here in a mendement of that she had beofre
trespaced with her here / yt is to say as she had before used it in the
pride and vanyte than she would put hit to the use of mekenes and devotion. And
also for the ferue^te love and devotion yt she had to him she would not be
let thereof by ye fetching of any cloth to wipe hem with. but so wypyng his
feet with her here / and afterward de uoutly kissynge hem ofth sythes / after
she a^oynted hem with a precious oynement that she brout with her: supposyng pe
raue^tur that our lords feet were hard of the weye / and also for inward
devotion beginning with dread at his feet as she did after with more boldenes
of love anointed his head. Lord god who so would inwardly think / and take heed
to this deed. of this woman and all the circumstau^ce thereof / mykel ghostly
fruit should he find theryn. sterynge to inward repentance of sin ne and to
true love of Jhesu and great devotion. But now forth as to the process take we
head also of the manner of our lord Jhesu in this time how benygnly and
pacyently he suffers her do all her will. For it lyked him full well
knowing the inward affection and the true love of her heart. And so all that
time he seaced of etyng. and also with him all the ghestes wondryng of the
woman / and of that uncouth deed: and of the pacyence of our lord Jhesu and
his suffrau^ce of her And specially of the master of the house / Simon demed
him gretely in his heart. that he would suffer such a common synful woman toche
him so homely. And in that he thought that he was no prophet / supposyng that
he knew her not but our lord that passing all other prophets knew the leest
thought of man^es heart. answered openly to his preuy thoughts she wyng him
self thereby a very prophet and more than a prophet. And by ensample of two
doctors he concluded him tusty fyeng the woman that he held so synful. and
preued that she loved him more / and showed more token of love by her deed than
he with all his feste / and so showing that not only the perfection of all
virtues. But also the Justifyeng of the sinful stant pryncypally in true love
of god. he said to Simon as for a conclusyon thus. Many sins ben foryeuen
her. for she loved myket. And then^e he turned him to mawdeleyne. and said to
her as for a full end of that she asked / Thy feyth has saved the / goo now
in pees. O lord Jhesu how sweet and lykyng was this word to her / and with how
great Joye that she went a wey / Sothely it was so lykyng / that as I trow
hit went never after out of her mind / And so was she perfytely converted to
Jhesu leuyng her syn^e fully and living ever after in all honest holyly and
drawn algate to him and to No^
his mother without departing perseuerau^tly / In the foresaid process and the
sentence of his gospel ben many great notabytees to our edificacyon / of the
which we shall touch som^e in party. First as to a sovereign. conforte of
all sinful folk we have here openly showed in our lord Jhesu ye habundau^ce
of his endeles mercy that so soon and so gladly foryafe so many great
sins and trespaces of this synful woman. And so does he to all that truly
desyren and asken his mercy: but here behooves charity and true love yt was so
specially commended Ca^i^as bo^^^^^
of him in this woman / ye whcihe only pees bitwene god and the synful man. As
the apostle says. that charity covers the multitude of sins / and without
the which it is Inpossyble to please god. For as saint Bernard says / the
qua^tite of every man's soul shall be taken and esteemed after the mesure of
Bernard su^ can. ser ^^vii
charity that is therein / that is to say that soul yt has mykel of charity
is great. And that has lytyl is lytyl / and that has naught. is naught / as
sayut Poule says after the rehersynge of many great virtues. concludynge thus.
If I have not charity soothely I am naught / And therefore says our lord of this
woman / that for she loves mykyl. therefore she had No^
mykel foryeuen as it was said before / Ferthermore also here have we ensample
of true repentance and penance that is V^^^ penite^cia pro peccatis Co^te a
lollardos No^ de co^te^^ io^e
nedful to forieuenesse of sin^es: showed in this woman Maudaleyne as we have
herd / the which penance as all holy Church techeth stant in sorrow of
heart / in shrift of mouth and in satisfacto^n of deed / But here paraue^tur
sum men thynkyng after the false oppynyon of lollardes. that shryft of mouth
is not needful / but that it sufiseth only in heart to be shriue^ to god as ye
foresaid woman was* for the gospel tells not that she spoke any word by
mouth. and yet was her sin fully foryeuen as it is said / and as it seems /
this is a great euyde^ce No^ ^^s^
for that opinion. But here to is an answer reasonable yt our lord Jhu^s to
whom she made her confession in heart was there in bodily presence very god
and man. to whom by virtue of the godhede was als open the thoute of heart as
is to man y^ speech of mouth. as often sithes the process of the gospel tellethe
and specially here openly both of y^ woman and also o^ the pharisees thout /
wherefore y^ thout of heart was only tha^ to him as mykel as is now therewith
speech of mouth to man bodily. And for as much as now in the new law what
time yt we syn^en dedely / we offenden him not only after his godhede but also
after his manhede that he bought us with fro sin and ghostly death. Therefore
us behooves to do satisfaccion to him after both kinds by true penance.
knowelechynge our trespaces both to god and man and asking foryeuenes. And sy
then we have not here his bodily presence as Maudaleyne had therefore in his
stead us behooves to show to the priest by word that we have offendid him as
man. as we shown to him by repentance in heart that we have offendid him as
god. y^ is to say at y^ lest by dedely syn^e / For thereby only we ben deperted
fro him: and unkindly lesen the great benefice that he gaf us in his manhede /
wherefore if we will be restored again and knytte to him as we were before in
grace. we must do satisfaction / not only to him as to god / but also as to
man that we have so forsake by dedely sin in manner as it is said / And so
as holy Church has resonably ordained and beden knowleche by mouth and make
our confession truly of our sin to the prestes that he has specially
ordained in his stead. as his vykers / here to by thoo words of the gospel
that he spoke to his dysciples when he said to them thus what so ever ye bynden
in earth. it shall be bonden in heaven And what so ye vnbynden in earth / shall
be vnbonden in heaven. Of this true penance needful for dedely sin not only
by repentance in heart. but also by shrifte of mouth to the priest in gods
stead if we may / For more our lord god afketh not / And therwyth of due
satisfaccion following / we have parfyte Ensample openly showed in this blessid
woman that was before so sinful. Mary maudeleyne in the process before said
of this Gospel. as it is open enough touching the first part and the last.
that is to say. repentance and satisfaccyon / And as to the Second that is
confession though we read hit not of her by word speking for that was no need
to him that knew fully her heart / our lord Jhu^ the re being in his bodily
presence as it is said / Nevertheless she showed the affeccion of this
confession parfitely in deed in that that she would not show her to him pryuate
as sinful and asking mercy / as she might have done betwyx him and her. or
else before his discyples: but sparing for no shame that is a great part of
penance in confession she chese the place and ye time where it might be to
her as open repreef and shame that was in the house of the pharysee of the
which she knew well having indygnacion and despyte of the sinful / and also
at the mete when hit should be most wondringe to him and al his ghestes upon
her for the repreef and shame yt she had of her syn^e was so great withinforth.
that she foryate all shame and reprefe without forth. And so in that deed she
knowleched openly her sin in general / and also by will in special not
refusinge for to have herd it reherced and openly told of him that she came to
our lord Jhesu / the which as she wiste well knew in special the least part
thereof / and that might resonably have reprehended her openly of it / or he
hade foryeuen it / But our curtois lord full of grace and mercy saw that very
contricyon in her heart. and that good. will grounded in true believe that he
was very god. and that might fully foryeue her No^ fide^ ^ ^a^i^ate^ ri
quisitis in co^tricione vera
syn^e as him lyked / and therewith that she had full hope to have his grace and
foryeuenesse. and also the fervent love that she had to him / the which three
virtues ben needful to every man y^ will have foryeuenes of syn^e / And so
without any more penance he fully foryaf all her sins. and bad her goo in
pees that was pees of conscience fully made between her and god and man. for
her true feyth and bilyue in the which were grounded parfitely hope and
charity. as it is said. had made her sauf / And so shall it the most sinful
man that is or ever shall be* if he have it truly grounded in his heart by
very contricion as she had. for then without doubt he will not spare for
any shame to knowleche his syn^e by word openly to man in gods R(...)
stead. as she did by will to him: that was both god and man as it is said.
But here parauentur seems to som^e men that as the sinful man shall follow
this woman by true forthin king of his syn^e. so should the priest follow our
lord in light foryeuynge showed thereof enioynyng no more penance than R(...)*
he did therefore / But here answer holy doctoures that sayen that the
contricion and the forthynkynge of sin may be so great and so parfite that it
suffyseth without any more penance to full foryeuenes there of the which
there as it is / if the priest might see and fully know / he should give no
more penance. But for as mykel as man sees not the heart as our lord Jhu^s
god and man did. and so may he not know it but in party as by tokens
wythoutforthe. therefore as to the syker part he shall enjoin penance for
sin more or less as holy church has ordained. And would god that all
sinful people would follow this woman in true forthynkynge and then^e with
N(...)i b^
out doubt they should have of god full foryeuynge were the penance more or
less of the prestes enioynynge / Ferthermore in the forsaid process of the
gospel / our lord Jhesus yaf ensample to the prechours of gods word that
they should not spare in time to say the sothe. for displesyng of hem yt feden
hem or yeuen hem other bodily sustenaunce. In that not withstondyng that the
pharisee fed him as he did often. he reprehendyd him openly in his own house
of his mysbileue and of his false thought. in the which he had indignacion of
the sinful woman. and as hit would seem to styring of his great maulgry he
spared not to Justifye that woman yt he demed No^ contra condione^ mala^
so sinful. showing her more loving god / than he / and that she was saved by
her true bileue before him yt failed thereof* but not withsto^dinge this on that
other side the pharisee left not after to feed him and do him humanite as many
men now done. the which what time yt a sothe is said that is contrary to
their will or opinion. they withdrawe^ her humanite and affeccion fro him that
seyth it: be he never so good or virtuous in lyuinge And sothely in yt
condition they shewe^ hem self what so ever they ben unloving to Jhu^s / that
is very sothfastnes and more unkind than was this pharisee / and so worthy
more reprefe of him and more pain. Nevertheless ye prechouror a another ghostly
man that represents Cristes person. shall not spare to say ye soth in time*
for dread or maulgre or withdrawyng of favor or any temporel profit if he
will be the true membre of crist. And soueraiuly be he ware of glosing. or
favor to error. for that is most abominable. Also in this process before
said of the gospel in yt that our lord Jhu^s reherced to the pharisee the good
deeds of the woman. in the which he failed / as that she wesshe his fete with
her teres that he did not with water. and so forth of other. and therewith he
told not what he did* to him that she did not / we have ensample and techinge
what time we be tempted to Justifienge of our self and reprefe of other /
then^e to think and have in mind the good deeds and virtues that been or may
ben in that other man foryetynge our good deeds or virtues. and bringyng to
mind our defaultes and trespaces. and so shall we virtuously deem our self
and excuse other. and so profit in the virtue of true mekenes that he grant
us myrroure of mekenes blessed Jhesus.

Hic premittu^tur duo capitula de sancto Johanne Baptista
Of the speaking of our lord Jhesu with the woman Samarytane at the pytte
Capitulum xxiii
IT befelle upon a time that our lord Jhu^s should go fro ye Country of Juda in
to galilee. he must make his wey by the Country of Samarye / where was a draw
well that they called the well of Jacob. that was a pit of water / upon the
which pytte he rested him as weary of going: Lord Jhu^ (...)
what is this that thou yt art the sothfast wey and maker of all erthly way.
so art weary of the wey. the which thorugh thy souereyne might berest up and
confortest all other in her way. But thus would thou in thy manhede show all
thy kyndely Infirmite of man. as in honger. in thurst and werines often sythes
and such other for to show the very kind of man that thou tokest for our
sake. and so was al thy bodily living in this world paynfull and traueillous
to our ensample / blessid be thou ever In the mean time as he sat so on the
well and his disciples were gone in to next the cite to bye men / there come a
woman of that country to fette water at yt well ye which was called lucy /
and our lord Jhu^s willing show to her and by her to other his godhede. spoke
with her long time of a great thing and high in Not^
ghostly understanding the which speking both of him and her. and how his
disciples come ageyn. and how at the woman's word the people of the Cite come^
out to him and held him with hem a certain time. and after how he went fro
hem. we passen over at this time. for as mykel as hit is open and plainly
written in the gospel of John. But in this process we may note in our lord Jhu^
first a token of great mekenes in that he would be al Nota ^^^^
lone what time he sent his disciples in to the cite for to bey mete. And in
that byenge ensample* that is leefull to gods servants for to have money
and reserve it to her need: Also in yt he spoke so homely with that simple
woman and of so great Contra s^perbos doctores and p^dicatores
things / as though it had be with many great wise me^. the pride and the
presumpcion of many great clerks and prechours is confounded and reproved. ye
which if they should show her wysedom or cu^nynge not only to one man / but
also to few men / they would hold all as lost and such a simple audience
tell unworthy to take her proud speech. Ferthermore in that the Exemplu^
contra gula^
dyscyples broughten her mete to him and beden him ete there at well / we have
ensample of pouerte and bodyly penance in his manner of fedynge after his
trauaylle / so there without the Cite as we may suppose drinking of the
water and that not only at this time / but as we suppose often sythes / when
he went by the country he ete in that manner without the towns and dwelling of
men at som^e River or well / were he never so weary or trauaylled in body.
showing therein ye great love that he had in pouerte and meekness. he used not
curyous dyghtynge of diverse metes roasted and soden. nor precious vessel of
silver of peewter / nor delycate wynes white and read but only the clean water
of ye well or the River etynge bread there with as a poor man mekely upon

go to mete / and said to hem thus / I have mete to ete yt ye know not / for

my mete is that I do and worche the will of him that sent me And so he abode
the coming of men of the Cite to preche hem. first we may see. how besy he was
about ghostly fedynge. First fulyllynge in deed that longs to the soul and
ghostly sustenau^ce / than that longs to the bodyly sustynaunce / though he
had thereto great need. And so yaf he Ensample to prechours and curates for to
do. Mykell more ghostly fruit is contained in this gospel. the which who so
desires to know more fully / he shall find hit in the book of saint
Augustyne / upon ye gospel of John / where he makes of ye process of this
gospel a long process and clergiable full of ghostly fruit But for asmoche as
here is made mind of ye pouerte of our lord Jhesus as it is often before. and
also of his abstynence / therefore of these two virtues perfytly taught us by
ensample / both of him and his discyples it shall follow after more plainly in
the next chapyter /

pro die Jouis /

How the disciples of Jhesu pluckede^ the eres of corn and eten it for honger
on the sabotte day / Caplm xxiiii.
IN a sabotte day as the discyples of our lord Jhesu we^ten by the feeldes
with him where ripe corn was growing / they were ahongred and pluckeden the
eres / and froteden hem between her hondes: and ete hem / And the pharysees
that ever aspyeden our lords words and deeds for to take him in defaulte
against their law: reproved herfore both him and his discyples / And sayden
that it was vnle^ffull on the sabotte day. But our lord excused hem first by
need that is out take in the law / As Dauyd and his men in need eten Nota
the prestes bread that was else forboden / And also by that reason that the
prestes of the law on the sabotte day cyrcumsiced and made sacrifyce. the
which were bodily works not so nedfull as that they diden / And also his
presence that was lord and auctour of the law yaue hem leave /

But if we take here Inward entente with devout compassyon of that need of
the disciples in the presence of their lord almighty. we owen resonably to be
stired to ye love of pouerte and bodily need for his sake / For wonderful it
is to think yt they that were chose^ so specially to y^ hye degree of
apostles. and there through made princes and domesme^ of the world should be
put in to so great pouerte and need for to ete the raw corn for hongre as
they were unreasonable bestes / and na^ly in his presence that was maker of all
mete and drink at his will: and lord of all the world. as though he might
not help hem at her need / But the good lord that did all thing for our
sauaco^n. he suffers this need in hem for the best as he took in himself all
the need of mankind without syn^e / And so though he had copasso^n of hem in
asmoche as he loved hem tenderly. Nevertheless it lyked him that need in hem and
the good will of he^ therwyth that gladly suffered that need for his love And
so it plesyd him not only for her mede that he knew much therefore. but also
for ensample for us that should come after / For Nota tria
here have we specially that have forsake the world for ye love of god
ensample and stirynge to three virtues namly that be^ needful to us / That is
to say pacye^ce in bodily need. perfyte pouerte. Primu^
and ayenste gloteny virtuous abstyne^ce / And as to the first sythen the
discyples of Jhu^ that hadden left and forsaken all yt Corporalis necessi^^^
they had for to follow him suffreden pacyently and gladly so great need of
bodily honger in his presence. whom they saw myraculously feed other men. and
help at her need / much more we owen to be pacyent in bodily need when it
falls that be^ not so worthy: ne so perfytly louen god / but rather have
deserved for our mysliuyng and unkindness ayenste our lord god much more
penance and disease than he will suffer us for to have / And peraue^ture we
come^ never to so great need for to suffer for his sake / As to the second
that is perfyte pouertee Secundu^ Perfectap^ upertas
for gods love. we shall understand that his pouerte passed in perfecco^n the
highest degree of wylful pouerte of other without co^paryson / For other men^es
pouerte that have forsaken for crystes love all rychesses and worshyppes of ye
world is in reputaco^n of me^ in asmoche as it is hold virtuous as it is /
But Nota de perfectissima paupertats Cristi
his pouerte was in repreyf and dispyte of men in asmoche as it was not known
yt he took this pouerte wilfully. but as of need as it semyth in the foresaid
process of him and his discyples. when they eten raw corn for honger and he
halpe hem not and in many other places of the gospel he showed him as poor and
nedy / And for asmoche as that pouertee that comyth of need and not of will is
in dispyte and repreif. and all that knewen him saw that he had another house
nor possessions. they hadden him in the more conte^pte. For comynly such
nedeful poor men ben dispysed of al men and set a^ naught / But nevertheless
they may be full honorable in his syghte that thus yaue ensample thereof /
wherefore it is full peryllous for to dispyse any poor man / But if we will
wit who is virtuously and perfytly Nota
poor. we shall understand that not only he that made his professo^n to
pouerte and has left all worldly richesses as in hauour without forth. but he
that therwyth has that pouerte set in his heart within forth: so that he
will not more love nor desire any worldely gods or possessions but only that
is needful to his living / For if a man be in pouerte and suffer need without
forth through lack of worldly gods. and therewith he desire with delyberacyon
in heart within forth more than him needs / that man lives not in virtuous
pouerte. but in wretched need without mede / For the lust of the will within
forth with full assente thereto suffyseth to the fulfyllyng of syn^e and to the
loss of mede / wherefore he yt will be perfyte pore Nota (...)
he must look that neither he have nor desire more than is nedeful to his
living. Of this virtuous pouerte spekyth saint Bernarde sermon quarto de
Adue^tu and in sermon quarto de Bernarde T^^^ta co^^^a g^l^^
Natiuitate dn^i / Ferdermore towchyng the third virtue that is abstynence /
whereof against gloteny we have ensample here in the discyples. and also before
in our lord Jhesu. we shall understand that gloteny is a vice against the
which it behooves us while we lyuen in this flesh for to have contynuell
battle. as holy faders that known the temptaco^n thereof by long experience
techen us. and specially saint Bernarde in diverse places tells how we
shall flee gloteny / and nourysshe the body only as it needs to the hele
thereof and more shall we not seche o^ desire to the body / wherefore in all that
we taken over / that is to say to fulfylle the lust and the likinge / that
passes the terms of kind. and disposes to death bodily and ghostly / Nota
contra plures bestiales and gulosos
And so it falls often that many men ben somoche over: comen with the lust
and likynge of the flesh / that as unreasonable bestes they putten the lust
before the hele taking such metes and drynkes the which they known well
contrary to their hele / And after the which they woten well that they shall
feel great passions and sekenesses / And so not only in the bodi undisposed
to serve god. and to virtuous occupaco^n But also ye N
soul is defoyled that he may not see god with clen^es of heart as he made
him to. And sothly this is a foul vice and a peryllous / And nevertheless much
people ben blinded and deceived in this point both ghostly and worldely: yt
excusen hem falsely by the love of the flesh and the stirynge of the lust /
that cominly eschewyth that is most wholesome to the kind / if it be not
likynge to the sensualyte. and desires that is most unwholesome if it be
delycate and likynge thereto / wherefore among all ye spices Nota
of gloteny this semith most reprouable. in asmoche as it is not only
contrary to the soul. but also it destroys and sleeth y^ body / And so he
that takes mete or drink wilfully knowing that it is contrary to him and
vndisposing to bodily hele. may dread of his dome and repreif in goddys syghte
as of a man sleer / and that is worse. sleer of himself / Other men that been
overcome by the sensualyte and the temptacyon of the flessh for to take of mete
and drink that is wholesome though it be likyng. either in vntyme or more in
qua^tyte than it needs or with great lust and gredynes ben more excusable for
the co: mine Infirmyte of the first syn^e of adam / But for asmoche as this
vice of gloteny in all his spyces is reprouable / therefore it is needful to us
for to eschew it to our power / And get and keep the virtue of dyscrete
abstynence / As our lord Jhesus and his apostles and other saints haven
both taught us and yeuen us Ensample keeping the body and fedynge as it is
needful thereto / after yt kind thereof and the travail that longs thereto.
In manner as a horse owes to be kept for to do his Journey / so that he fail
not by defaulte by to mykell abstyne^ce on that one side. and that he be not
rebelle to the spirit and proud by mykel pamprynge on that other side. but in
a good mean of abstinence that techeth the virtue of dyscression. the D(...)
whtche discression as saint Bernard says is not only a virtue. but also keeper
and leder of all other virtues: For if that lack yt seems virtue is vice. And
as sanit gregory says Discression is mother and kepar of all virtues / this
discression touching abstynence and fedynge of the body. stant generally in
this point as saint augustyn says in his book of confessions y^ a man take of
mete and drink to sustenau^ce of the body only as he would take of medecyne
for to hele his Infirmyte. wherefore right as in taking of medecyn man has no
reward to more or less / or to the preciosite. or boystnesse or swetnesse or
bytternes / but only as it is most convenient and profitable to hele the sore
or the sickness / so for as mykell as honger and thurst ben Infyrmyte of
mankind thuroghe the first sin of man. mete and drink that been as medecyn
to this Infirmite should be take only as for hele thereof / as saint augustyn
seyth Thus mykell is specially spoken here of abstine^ce and glotony by
occasion of the honger and the simple fode there against of y^ disciples of
Jhesu as it it said / for as mykell as here ends y^ third part of this book
that stant in co^te^placion of Cristes life for the wenesday / upon the which
day to our ensample he began to fight against glotony specially by his fasting
in deserte as it is said before. the which vice of glotony he grant us of
his grace to eschew and the virtue of discrete abstyneuce to keep that is
blessid wythouten end Jhesus

Of the fedinge of the great people with bread multiplied Capitulum xxv


Two times the gospel tells that our lord Jhu^s multyplyed a few loves of
bread. and there with fed many thousands of men to the full: In the which
process taking head to the words and the deeds of our lord Jhesu as the
gospel openly tells. we may see to our edyficacion ghostly many good
sterynges to love him and thank him and worship him soueraynly. and specially
we may see in this process that our lord Jhesus was merciful and curteys and
kind and dyscrete and circumspecte. First that he was merciful. shown Jhesus
mise ricors
his words he said thus / I have pity and mercy upon the people / so that
mercy styred him and drough him to help hem and feed hem at her need / for as
dauyd witnesses / All the earth is full of his mercy / Also he showed his great
curtesy and wonderful kyndenesse in the cause that he assygned after saying
thus / For loo now these three days they abyden Jhesus curia lis
and suffren and beren me fasting / and they have not whereof to ete / as
though he were bounden to them for her benefice done to him in that they abyden
so with him. And nevertheless in sothenes it was for her owen good and profit
and not for his. But that is his sovereign kyndenes and curtesy and endeles
godenes yt he has likyng to dwell with us only for our profit and sauacion.
though there be there thorugh as to him none encrees of his godenesse. wherefore
all tho that so lowen him by good living and gladly heren his doctrine and
kepen his hestes. he loves and has likynge to dwell with hem ghostly and
fails never to help hem at her need / Ferther more our lord Jhesus taking
head* that many of the people were come to him fro far country and seenge
the peril of the people in mykel fasting. by cause of ye great trauayll that
they should have in her going again said thus / If I suffer hem Jhesus (...)
goo home again in to her owe^ houses fasting. they shall fail and perisshe by
the way / where he showed that he was discrete and circumspecte seenge before
her need / and vnmyght / and therefore ordeynyng remedy and help before by her
bodily sustenau^ce N
that was nedeful to her travail to come after. And so in this speech and deed
of Jhu^ is doctrine and Ensample of discress you to prelates and hem that haven
cure of other to take heed of her In tyrmyte and of her travail. and thereafter
ordeyne to hem bodyly sustenau^ce couenable and sufficient that they fall not
by defaulte ^
in the weye of this bodily living in earth. Also in the foresaid process we
may understand ghostly the gracious governance of our lord Jhesus to us
living in this world each Noc^^^^^s
day. For we have not to ete bodily or ghostly but he give us / And so if he
suffer us fasting we shall fail in the wey. For without him we may not help
our self in any ghostly need wherefore we have no matter of elacion or vain Joye
of our self what time that we felen any comfort or profit in ghostly
excercyse. for it is naught of us but only on him / and so if we take good
entente we may see that they that been true servants of god and chosen of him.
the more parfyte that they ben in living and the nere god. and the more
excellent in his yeftes of grace: the more meke they ben and the more abiecte
in her own sight. For they known well that they have naught of hemself but
wretchydnesse and syn^e. For the nere that a man comes to god. the more clear
sight he has ghostly / and so he sees the more clerly the great godenes and
the mercy of god. wherefore pride and vain Joye that comen of ghostly blyndenes
may not have place and resting in his soul that is so lyghtned through grace /
For without doubt he that knew well god. and sothely examyned him self /
might not be proud dedely / Also here is great comfort to sinful men of the
great mercy of our lord Jhesu if they wyllen torn again and come to him by
very repentance what time they ben departed fro him and gone in to the far
country of wyckednes. for as the gospel tells that he was specially stired
to mercy of the people / for as mykell as som^e of hem were comen to him fro
far country. So without doubt will he to every sinful man that will come to
him ghostly as it is said by his weye of de partinge never so long before /

Of the fleing of our lord Jhesus when the people would have made him her
king / Eapitulum xxvi
AFter that our lord Jhu^s had fed the people to the full as it is said in
the next chapter before. they seenge his might in that miracle / and how he
might help hem at her need. for her profit temporel they wolde^ have made him
her king. But our lord Jhu^s knowing this will of hem / hem vnwyttyng fled
in to the hill. so that they might not find him. And this was that hill as
sum clerks sayen upon y^ which he made that excellent sermon / that is
spoke of before: and thus he fled / for he would not have temporell king
domes and vain worlds worship. But take we here good intent how and in what
manner he fled this worship effectuelly without feynyng. First he badde his
disciples take the ship and goo in to the water before him and then^e he
allone went in to the hyl so. So that if the people would seche him among his
disciples they should not find him. And so he escaped awey fro hem that soughte^
him to worship. yeuyng Ensample to us for to flee temporell worship / for he
flede not that worshipe for him self / but for us. knowing what peril it is
us for to coueite or desire temporell worship / For soth it is that No^ co^ca^

worship is one of the most perilous gnaris of the enemy to catch and begyle
man^es soul / and one of the heuyest burden that draws down and ouercometh
the soul dedely* whether hit be worship or prelacy or of temporel lordship. or
of great conynge. For scarcely is there any man yt has desire in worship. but
that he is in great peril of falling. or else fully fallen down P(...)
in the pytte of dedely syn^e. as we see by many resons. First for as mykell as
he that has great delight in worship is besy al times in his mind. how he
may keep his worship and make it more. and so as gregory says / In as mykel
as a man has set his liking in thing that longs to the world or to the
flesh here byneth forth / in so mykel is he departed fro y^ ghostly S(...)
likyng and love of god. and heavenly things above forth Also he that loves
worshyppes is besy to procure and get him friends yt now keep him in his
worship / And also further him to gretter worshyppes. wherefore often sythes
fallen diverse causes in the which he offended god and his owen conscience for
to please such friends. And in the same manner he makes he^ (...)
to do for him. Also comynly he has indygnacion of other y^ ben in worship.
and bacbyteth hem to make himself more worshipful and more worthy. and so he
falls in to hate and envy of Qu^^^^
his brother. Also he hold him felf in his owen sight and also desired to be had
so in othermens sight worthy and worship full / And so he falls in to y^
foul vice of elacion and pride and vain glory / But therefore as the gospel
says. He that hold him self as ought worthy when in soothenesse he is
naught / he deceyueth foul him self / and therefore said our lord to his
disciples in the gospel / when ye huae done all things that been beden to you.
say ye sothely with heart. we be^ unworthy and vain servants. But this may
not he say that hold Quintu^
himself worthy and worshipful. Ferthermore as to the last when this lykyng
of worshype is roted in man / he is so hongry and gredy after worshippes that
he may not be filled. but every day procures new worshippes / and the gretter
and the more that he geteth / the more he coueyted / and desires. For he
holds algate himself more worthy and worshipful than he was before / both
in his own sight and in other man's sight / and so he falls in to deep
couetyse: that is the fowlest vice and the rote and the cause of many other
vices / Of this vain delight in worshippes and of the peril thereof. saint
Bernard speaks to men Bernardus sermo ^^^o de a^c^^sion^
specially in this manner. All we ben noble and worthy creatures and of a great
manner will. wherefore kyndely we desiren high nes. But woo to us if we will
follow him that will set his sete in the hill of high lordshipe. and high
might / and be like to god in worship that was lucifer y^ thus stighe up by
proud will in to the hill of hyghnes first a glorious Angel. but suddenly fell
down therfro made a foul fend of hell / Also takes head ferthermore y^ he
that foul fend after his false coveting by his wicked envious will to cast man
down fro his bliss / he durst not tempte him for to styghe up to that hill
of lordshipe and great might / that himself so suddenly fell down fro. but as
a falls trechour he showed him in another hill like thereto. that is to say the
hill of great conning. and cou^ceylled him falsely to styghe up in to this
hylle by proud desire of worshipe when he said to him in this manner / ye
shall be as gods thrughe great conning / knowing both good and evil. And
for as mykell as man gaf his assente to his sugestyons: Therefore he fell down
as he did. And so we may see that couetyse of great lordshype and high
might pryued the angel of angels bliss and desire of great conning
despoyleth man of the Joye of endeles life And of both myscheues was ground
and cause. delight and desire of vain worship / wherefore seenge this peril
of vain worship if we dread the fall of the angel and of man. we must flee
in will fro both these hills of hye lordshypp^ and great cu^nynge. and goo
up with our lord Jhu^ in to the hylle of co^templaco^n and deuoco^n by
mekenes: forsakyng the world and the will to be worshypped of the common people
as he did / But in this fleenge fro the people and going of him allone in to
Notabile ^^^^
the hill as it is said before in the process of the gospel. take we head
ferdermore to our edifycaco^n. how he left his discyples and made hem against
her will to take the ship and go^ in to the sea without him / For they would
not her thonkes have been departed fro him / And in that was her desire good for
to dwell ever with her lord / Nevertheless he ordained otherwise seenge what

comynly with ghostly lyuers by special felinge of the presence of Jhu^ and of
his absence in her soul th^^ would not that ever he should goo fro hem. as by
special ghostly comfort in any time / But he does other ways For he gooth
and comyth as it is his will: and for her best / But what shall such a deuowte

absence of her spouse. and by ensample of the disciples of Jhu^ that through
obedience at his biddynge wenten in to the ship. and token the water in his
absence / Suffer the wawes and tempests of temptaco^n and aduersyte: and
pacye^tly abide till he would of his grace come in to that soul: and make
rest and pees as it shall follow after in the process next to come / Of this

AFter the discyples of our lord Jhu^ were gone in to the ship and the water
as he badde hem: and as it is said be fore: he went up in to the hill alone:
and there was he ocupyed in prayer in to the fourth part of the night: so
that three parties of the night that were past he had continued in prayer / And
notabil: de or^e
thus we read often times he yaaf him to prayer / where fore take we here good
intent in what manner he prayed and how that he loweth him in his manhede. and
mekith him to his fader of heaven / He chesith solytary places. and gooth to he^
alone to pray and does his tender body to penance. and wakyth long
wakynges. he prays as ye true herd for his sheep. For n^ qual^^ Jhs orat
he prays not for himself. but for us. and as our advocate and mediator
between the fader and us / And also he prays to ensample of us that we should
often times pray. and specially love prayer / For often times he badde his
dyscyples and taught hem for to pray / And so that he badde hem by word: he
showed himself in deed / He taught hem and said that it behooves and is
needful ever to pray: and not fail in leuynge thereof showing that co^tynuyng
and often asking in prayer: getith at last without fail yt thing that is
asked: and hereof he told ensample of y^ Luce. xviii.
domesman. that at last through long cryenge and asking of the wydo we did
her right: as the gospel of luke tells / Also to styre hem for to pray and
trust for to get that they asken he told a another ensample of a friend. That
at last through much asking. lent to his friend the bread yt him neded as the
same Luc. xi.
gospel tellith in process co^cludynge and saying thus / Asks: and it shall
be yeue^ to you / And all this he said to teache us y^ virtue of good prayer. the
which may not be esteemed: for the virtue Notabil
thereof is so mighty and so great: that it getith al godenes. and puttith
away al manner of wickydnes / wherefore if you wolt patiently vict^ oro^ m^

the good lord with his right hand took him up and kept him fro perysshynge.
and then went in to the ship with him. and anon all the tempest ceased.
and all was in pees and tranquylite / And so the discyples with great
reverence and Joye receyuynge her lord weren putt in great rest* and

the pharysees askeden him: whi that his disciples wysshe not her hondes when
they went to mete / And in that they kept not her custom after the techynge
of her elders / But our lord seenge that they charged more the washing

god for her tradyco^nes and bodily obseruau^ces. declarynge after that vices
that comen out of the heart defoylen more a man than does the bodily mete

him. but he took none head thereof. for they we ren* blind in soul through

day that weren gods holy days to the Jews as ben now the sondayes to
christian men. that he did to confuso^n and repreyf of the Jews that kepten
straytly the law in bodily obseruaunces. and not in ghostly understanding as

saint Gregory says that a man shall rather suffer sclau^der for to rise. than
he shall leave the truth / that is to sa^e in three manners after the common

though they ben good in hemself: for to put away occasion of sclau^der as
thapostle poul says That would rather never ete flessh than he would there
thorugh give occasyon of sclaunder to his brother /

more the clennesse of soul / And that disposes N co^traplures specialit

to virtues. thanne bodily clennesse and honest without forth: that is no

ben good customs that been grounded upon reason for to be kept / But the

Wherefore in this point erren many christian men. and specially religious that

Of the Transfyguracyon of our lord Jhesu in the hylle / Eaplm xxx.


Our lord Jhu^s willing to conferme and stre^g the his dyscyples in y^ true
believe. that he was both god and man / He showed hem that he was very man by
that he suffered after ye kind and the common Infyrmyte of man / And also that
he was god. by the miracles that he wroughte above ye common kind and might of
man / And therwyth all so he informed hem: and told he^ before that he should
suffer paynfully the hard death as man. and after arise up gloryously to life as
god. and to this end what time as the gospel of mathewe and mark and luke
tellen math vii marc. 13. Luc. i^.
yt he had told his discyples: that he should suffer many reproues and
dispytes in Jhrlm. and at the last be slain and deed / And after that he
should rise fro death to life the third day / Then^e ferdermore he concluded
and said. that there were some of hem that there stoden at that time. the
which should not taste bodily death till they seen man^es sone* that was
himself coming in his kingdom: that is to say. aperynge in a wonder full and
Joyeful clernesse of his ma^hede as longyng to his kingdom / And that for to
fulfill this byhest: about the viii. day after he took with him peter James
and John up in to an hye hylle that was as clerks sayen called Thabor / And
there he was transfygured in her syghte. that is to say: turned out of the
low lyknes of servant in to the high and glorious lyknes of his kingdom /
For his face shone as the son: And his clothes were also white as the snow /
And there with therap: pereden Moses and Hely speaking with him of his passion
yt he should suffer in Jherusalem / In the which blysfull syghte y^ discyples
were rauysshed and specially peter: feryetyng al erthly thing desired for to
have dwelled stylle there in yt blysfull place and said / Lord it is good that
we abide and dwell he^ And therefore if thou wolt. make we here iii.
tabernacles. one to the / One to moses. and one to hely. but he wyste not what
he said: neither in that he would have dwelled with Jhu^s in bliss: before
that he suffered with him the passion of death as he had told hem before yt he
should do. nor in that he would have severed hem iii. that were all one as in
ghostly feeling the law the prophets and Jhu^s / And therefore to conferme
him. yt is to say Peter and his felawes in true believe of Jhu^s. that he was
goddys sone: and that they should here and follow him in all thing / Therwyth
a bryghte cloud ouershadowed hem* and out of the cloud came a voys fro the
fader of heaven saying This is my byloued sone: in whom me likes well. and
therefore here ye him: that is to say in all that he techyth / For he is very
sothfastnes without lesynge: and therwyth follow him in that he shewith / For he
is the right way without erryng whom ye have herd in the law: that is
understand in moses and in the prophets that is understand hely / And
then^e wha^ the dyscyples had herd this heavenly voice before said of the
fader. they fellen down on the earth on her faces with great dread / for the
Infirmyte of man might not bear that hye voys above kind / And then our
lord Jhu^s benygly lift hem up: and badde hem not dread / And therwyth they
lyftynge up her eyes: and lokynge abowte hem: saw no more: but all oonly
Jhesus / And as they wenten down the hylle. he badde hem tell no man that
they had seen. till the sone of a man were risen fro death to life / This is y^
process of y^ gospel in the which who so has grace of ghostly understanding
and swetnes may se many notabilytees to lowing and dispisyng of man himself and
to fervent deuoco^n and love of god / And specially he y^ has feeling above
kind and is yeuen special grace may taast and have much ghostly comfort.

For as saint Augustyn says / He that made the without the: woll not Justifye

delyuerd and cleansed of syn^e that we fall not wylfully again thereto: leest
that our unkindness in ye party worthily be p^nysshed more hard of our lord.
wherefore he said to that seek man that he helyd / Goo and will thou sin no

thing notabile is yt wicked men gladly supposen virtuous deed of other men in
to the wors party: and so they lesen her mede comynly: as good men on that
other side supposen all thing in to the better part in encreace of her mede /
Thus ye Jews full of envy when they saw y^ seek man hole myraculously of our
lord Jhu^: and berynge away his bed on the sabott day at his biddynge. they
askeden him: who bad him bear his bed: but they askeden not who made him hole
/ And so they token that part that hem thought reprouable* But they left
that part that was commendable / And thus comynly they did in all the
miracles of our lord Jhu^ / In ye same manner worldly men and flesshly torn in
to ye wors part: that good men and ghostly tornen in to the best party For
they that been in charity. and dreden god: living rightwysly aretten al thing

of her own sins and other men^es and of the deuilles works they profyten

process in special mind of the angel we shall understand that gods angels
ben as mynystres and means between god and devout souls. as saint Bernarde
says / wherefore we owen to worship hem and thank hem / And for as much as
they ben contynuelly present with us. we shall eschew to think or speak or

How our lord Jhu^s cast out of the temple the byars and the sellars ayenste
goddis law / Caplm xxxii.
TWo times as the gospel makith mind our lord Jhu^s cast out of the temple
the buyers and the sellars therein. and that with a scourge made of cords. y^
which deed among all the miracles y^ he wrought semith wonderful. for what
time that he wroughte other miracles in y^ which he showed the souerayn might
of his godhede: the pharisees and the scrybes and other of the Jews dispyseden
and reproueden him. but at this time when they were in great multitude gadred
in the temple and in her great sole^pnytee they had no power to wythstonde him
alone / And the cause was for the ghostly fire of his zele bren^ynge within
forth for the vnworshippynge of his fader specially in that place: where he
owed most to be worshipped: showed him so dreadful in his face without forth.
y^ they were wonderfully adradde and disco^fyted. and hadden no power to
wythstonde him / This process after the exposicyon of saint Gregory and other
doctors is full dreadful to all criste^men: but namly to prelates and curates
and other men of holy church: and specially we religyous that been set in
goddis temple for to serve him contynuelly in devout prayer and other ghostly
exercyses / If we give us to coueytyse and vanytees and meddle us over need with
worldly occupaco^ns and chaffaringes as they dyden. we may skylfully dread the
Indygnaco^n of Jesu and his casting out fro grace in this life: and after
departing of his bliss everlasting / wherefore thou that wol^ not dread the
Indygnaco^n of Jhu^. look that in no manner y^ putt the wylfully nor meddle the
to thy power with worldly occupaco^n / But for this matere is fully and
plenteuously treated in the exposico^n of this gospel in many places. therefore
we passen over thus shortly at this time Post istud capitulu^ s^qtur in

Of the receyuynge of our lord Jhes^ by the two systers. Martha and Mary: and
of those two manners of lyuynges that been actyf and contemplatyf in holy church
/ Caplm. xxxiii.


It befell upon a time y^ caplm. (...).
our lord Jhu^s went with his disciples to bethani that was called the castle
of marthe and mary: and came in to the house of hem / And they that loueden him
with all her hertes weren glad and Joye full of his coming / And martha the
elder sister that had the cure of the household: anon besyed her and went
fast about to ordeyne for the mete couenable to him and to dyscyples. But her
sister mary foryetynge all bodily mete* and desuyng so: ueraynly to be fed
ghostly of our lord Jhu^: set her down on the ground at his fete / And
casting her eyes and her heart and her eeres in to him oonly / with more Joye
and liking than may be spoken was fed ghostly and comforted in ye blessed
words of our lord Jhu^. for he would not be idle. but as his common manner
was: occupied him with speaking of edyficacyon and words of everlasting life
/ Martha that was so besily occupied about the mynystraco^on and the seruyse
of our lord Jhu^ and his discyples seenge her sister Mary so sittynge as it
were in idleness. took it heuely and complained her to our lord as he had
take no reward thereto / And prayed him that he would bid her sister rise and
help her to serve: and then^e was Mary aferde leest she should have be taken
fro that sweet rest and ghostly liking that she was in / And naught she said
but hanged down her head. abidynge what our lord would say / And then our
lord answering for her said to Martha that though she was besy. and troubled
about many things: nevertheless one thing was necessary. and that was the
best part yt mary chose which should never be take fro her / And then^e was
mary greatly comforted. and satte more sykerly in her purpose / And Martha
without envy held her paid and served forth with good will /

In this process of the gospel foresaid and told so shortly touched after
the letter. we may note and understand many fair things ghostly to our
edifycaco^n / And first the great goodness of our lord Jhu^ in his homely
coming to that poor house of the two systers martha and mary taking often
times with good will and likynge such simple refecco^n and bodyly fode as they
had / For as it semyth well by yt saying of martha that her sister let her
serve alone. there was not multitude of servants. and so follows that there
was not great array in diverse messes or many delycate metes and drynkes. and
yet came our lord ofter more customably to that place than he did to any
other to take his bodily fode. and that specially as I trow for ye great love
and affecco^n y^ he had to mary after her co^uersyon as he knew well y^ she
loved him seueraynly ever after as it is said before / And so it semyth that
our lord Jhu^s woll love specially. and often visyte by grace and dwell
ghostly with yt soul. that by true repentance and penance forsakyth her
syn^e: and perseuerau^tly kepyth her in y^ love of him / Lord how glad and
Joyful were these ii. systers foresaid of y^ coming at that time of this
blessed gheste Jhu^s to her spouse and prycipally mary / For as it semyth after
y^ process of the Nota
gospel this was the first time yt he came to that house. and y^ soon after ye
conversion of mary foresaid. and in somoche it was the more Joyful to her / For
then^e she had that she soueraynly loved and only desired / And therefore her
sister not knowing how it stood with her within forth in her heart. and see^ge
her manners changed y^ was wont before to be ocupyed in besynes of bodily
mynistraco^n with her: and now as taking no reward thereto. but sittyng and
tendyng only to y^ sweet conte^placion of Jhu^ as it is said before. merueyled
greatly thereof / And therefore co^playned to our lord as it is said. not
reprouynge her sister after the common condyco^n of wym^en. in token and
ensample that he that is occupied virtuously in actyf life shall not reprove
him that is in rest of conte^platyf life though it seem to him that he be as
idle

Of actyf life and contemplatyf life /
By these two sisters foresaid martha and mary as holy men and doctors written
ben vndstonden two manner lives of crystenmen / That is to say actyf life and
conte^platyf life / Of the which there ben many tretees and great process
made of diverse doctors. and specially the forsaid Bonauenture in this book of
crystes life makyth a long process alledgynge mani auctoritees of saint
bernarde: y^ which process though it so be y^ it is full good and fructuous as
to many ghostly lyuers Nevertheless for it semyth as inpertyne^t in great party
to many common persons and simple souls that this book in english is written
to as it is said often before: therefore we passen over shortly taking thereof
that semyth profitable and edyficatyf to our purpose at this time / And first
it is to vndstonde y^ the process of the foresaid bonauenture of these ii.
manner of lives actif and conte^platyf lo^geth specially to spirituel persons
as be^ prelates: prechers and religyous. and so he says at begyn^yng that
actyf life y^ is vndstonde by martha has ii. parties / And y^ Prima vite active
first part is that manner of living by the which a man^es besynes stant
pryncypally in that exercise that longs to his own ghostly profit. that is
to say in amendynge of himself. as wythdrawyng fro vices and profityng in
virtues / First as to profit of himself. and afterward as to his neybour by
works of ryghtwisnes and pity and deeds of charity. as it shall be said more
plainly herafter / The second part of actyf life is wha^ a man^es ocupaco^n and
besines stant in that exercise that lo^geth Scda
to the profit of other men pryncypally: though it so be also therwyth to his
own mede y^ more thereby. as it is in gouernyng of other men and techyng and
helpyng to ye hele of soul / As done prelates and prechers and other yt have
cure of soul / And between thise two parties of actyf life before said stant
conte^platyf life / So yt in this order first a man traueylle. and give him to
good exercise in prayer and in study of holy scryptures and other good werchyng
in common conuersaco^n amendyng his life. and wythdrawyng fro vices and
profitynge in getyng of virtues / And after then^e secondly resting in
conte^placion / yt is to say in solitude at leest in heart forsakyng all
worldly besynes with all his might be abowte contynuelly to think on god and
heavenly things oonly tendynge to pleyse god / And then^e herafter when he is
perfytly in tho two foresaid exercyses taute and stabled in very wisdom and
virtues: and litned thorugh grace desirynge the ghostly profit of other men:
then may he take sikerly upon him y^ cure and the gouernayle of other And so
after ye foresaid process first it behooves. y^ in the first part of actyf life
man^es soul be purged of vices and stre^gthed and comforted in virtues / After
that it be informed taught and lyghtned in conte^platif life. And then^e in y^
iiii. degree may he sikerly goo out to go uernayle and profit of other as it
is said upon this foresaid process of bonaue^ture so shortly touched. he
alledgith after many auctoritees of saint bernarde for to preueal y^ parts
thereof yt is to say. y^ first of actyf: y^ second conte^platyt and the third
yt is the second of actyf life y^ which we pass over with great process of
co^te^placo^n and many auctorytees of saint bernard. for few there be^ y^ more
harm is either in state of co^te^platyf life touching the ii: point before said
or in the state of perfect actyf life touching the iii. point that comen to her
astate by y^ true way that is declared before / And this is y^ cause that in
this time many there ben: both men and wym^en in the state of co^te^platyf
life. as specially ankeresse and recluses or heremytes y^ weten lytill as in
effect truly what co^templatyf is by defawte of exercise in actyf life as it is
before said And therefore it is peryllous and full dreadful to be in a state of
perfecco^n and have a name of holiness. as haven specially thise recluses / But
the living and the ghostly exersyce of hem ben according thereto / For saint
gregory says that there ben many that fleen thoccupaco^n of the world and
taken hem to rest: but therewith they ben not occupied with virtues. and therf
of often times it falls. that the more sykerly yt they seace fro out ward
ocupaco^n. the more largly they gader in to hem by ydlenes the noise of unclean
thoughts / And so of every such yt spenden her time in idleness and slouthe:
spekyth the prophet Jeremye in his lamentaco^ns in this manner / Videru^t illa^
ho^tes et deriseru^t sabbata eins. that is to say / The wicked sprrytes enmyes
of mankind seenge and taking head of the living of such an idle soul:
laughen to scorn her days of rest For in that she is far fro outward
occupaco^n. and thereby is trowed to serve god in holiness. in somoche she
seruyth the tyrauntry of the wicked spirytes in ydlenes / Also the same bo^ ly
clerk saint Gregory in the same book after the speaking of thise two lives
actyf and co^templatyf says that man^es soul should first be wiped and made
clean of the desire of temporel Joye and vain glory. and of all delectaco^n or
likynge of flessh: ly lust and desire / And then^e may he be lift up to the
syghte and degree of contemplacion / In figure and token hereof when god gaaf
moses the law / the common people were forbode to com^nygh the hill: In token
that they that been of weyke will. and desyren erthly things. should not
presume to clymbe up to y^ high things of contemplaco^n / And ferdermore
declarynge how they shall preue theymselfe able that woll goo to conte^: platyf
life says / That first it behouyth that they preue hem self by exercise of
virtues in the field of werchyng: that is to say that they know hemselfe
besily: if they done none harm to her neighbor / And if they bear pacye^tly
harms and wrongs done to them of other men / Also if they have no gladness
in heart or likynge when temporell goods fallen to them / And agaynwarde if
they ben not to heavy or sorry whan^e they ben wythdrawen / Also if they felen in
her mind the love of spirytuell things so mighty y^ it ouercomyth and puttyth
out of her heart the affecco^ns and ymagynaco^n of all erthly things / And
some that they coueyte^ to come to that thing that his above her kind. they
ouercomen that y^ they ben by kind / All this says saint Gregory / Herto
according saint bernarde and all other doctors generally sayen / that who so
woll goo to contemplatyf life. it behouyth that he be first preued in exercise
of actyf life / In figure whereof is alleged comynly the story of the ii.
daughters of laban. the which Jacob took to his wives that were called the
elder lya that was sore eyed. but plenteuous in beryng chyldern. by who^ is
tokened adyf life / The younger was rachel fair and lovely / but bareyne: and
by her is tokened conte^platyf life. And thou it so were y^ Jacob loved better
rachel than lya. and coueyted first to have had her to wife for his vii: year
service. ^euertheles he was made to take first the elder Lya. in token that
actyf life should be before contemplatyf as it is said / And this story is
plainly treated in many places to this purpose: and therefore we pass over so
shortly /

De vita actiua and contemplatiua /

BUt for to speak of the manner of living in thise ii. lives actyf and
conte^platyf in specyal / And namly of actyf that stant in so many degrees as
of seculers and relygyous and lered and lewd it were hard. and would ask
long process. and also as it semyth it needs not / For the general exercise
of actyf life. as it lo^geth first to a man himself that is in fighting
against vices and besy in getynge of virtues / And also after as it longs to
his eue^crysten. that is in fulfyllyng of y^ deeds of mercy: and alms deeds
doing of he^ y^ have habu^daunce of te^porell goods: In every degree is
written sufficyently as I hope: and therefore I have left to speak more of this
matter at this time sauf to make an end according to the begyn^ynge of the
matter before said in y^ gospel of thise ii. systers martha and mary. by the
which ben understand thise two lives: actif and conte^platyf as it is said /
First they that been in actif life have ensample in martha of that virtue that
is souereynly ned full to hem in all her deeds. that is charity / And first as
to he^ self that they ben without dedely syn^e / For else Jhu^s woll not
dwell in her hous^e accept her service / Also as to other S^dm*
that they deem not ne dispyse other: the which perau^ture done not so many
virtuous deeds as to man's syghte as they done / For they may not know the
preuy domes of our lord Jhu^ that accepted more plesyngly and preferred the
preuy co^te^placo^n of mary that satte at his fete in scylence. as she had be
idle. before all the great besy service of martha: and that was for the fervent
love that she had in contemplaco^n of him / And yet was the service and the
besines of martha full pleysynge to Jhu^. and medefull to her as actyf life is
good. but co^templatif beter / And so ferdermore it is to note. that
notwithstondyng Terciu^
the great comm^endacion of our lord Jhu^ touching mary and the preferrynge
of her part: Martha grutched not of her part. but continued forth in her
manner living seruinge customably to Jhu^ and his discyples / As John
wytnessith after in his gospel. in token that he that is called to god and
stant in the state of actyf life hold him paid. and grutche not. though
conte^platyf life be commended before his astate / For how so ever it stant of
thise two estates and degrees living god wot alonly who shall be before a
another in the bliss of heaven of tho persons in thise astates. and thus mykel
be said as touching the part of martha and of actyf life tokened by her /
Ferdermore touching conte^platyf life: he that is in that state has ensample
in mary of three things that neden souereynly to that state* that been mekenes
pacyence and scilence / First meknes Primu^ notabil
is tokened in the low sittynge of mary at fete of our lord Jhu^ / And but
this ground be truly set in the heart of him that is in this degree of
contemplaco^n / That is to say. that he presume not of his own^ holiness. but
that he dispyse him self truly in his own syghte: as it is reherced and told
before in diverse places what longs to mekenes / Sothly else all his bildyng
of conte^placo^n be it never so hye woll not stand steadfastly: but soon at a
lytill wind of aduersyte fall to naught / The second virtue according
herto. is pacyence in suffryng falls demynges. scornynges and reprouynges of y^
world. S^dm Notabil
that he shall suffer that fully forsakyth and dispyseth y^ world as it needs
to the true conte^platyf com^yttynge always by pacyence in heart his cause to
his advocate jhesu. without ansuere reprouynge again. as mary did: when the
pharysee demed and reproved her / Also her sister playned upon her and the
discyples had Indignaco^n and grutched against her / But in all thise she kept
scylence / That is the third virtue needful to the conte^platyf: and so
ferforth she yaaf ensample Terciu^ Notabil
of scylence that we find not in all the gospel that she spoke before the
resurrecco^n of our lord Jhu^: sauf ones by a short word at reysyng of her
brother lazar. notwythstondyng the great love of our lord Jhu^ showed to him
and to the great likinge that she had in the words and the holy doctrine of
him. that should styre her by reason the more boldly to speak / And who so
coueyteth to know the fruit of virtuous scylence. if he have affecco^n and
will to trow contemplatyf living with out doubt he shall be better taught by
experyence than by writing and techynge of man / And nevertheless saint
bernarde and many other holy faders and doctors commenden highly virtuous
scylence as it is worthy / whereof and other virtuous exercise that longen to
contemplatyf living And specially to a recluse / And also of meddled life* That
is to say some time actyf. and some time contemplatyf as it longyth to diverse
persons that in worldly astate have grace of ghostly love / who so woll more
plainly be enfourmed and taught in english tongue: Let him look the tretees
that the worthy clerk and holy liver master ^alter Hylton the chanon of
Thurgarton wrote in english by high grace and dyscrecion / And he shall
find there as ^ leave a suffycyente scole and a true of all these. whoos soul
rest in everlasting pees* As I hope he be full high in bliss Joined and
knytte without departing to his spouse by perfyte use of the best part that
he chese here with mary /

Of the which part he grant us felyshyp Jhesus our lord god /

A M E N
Of the Reysynge of Lazar. and other two deed bodies. Caplm xxxiiii.


Among all the miracles that our lord Jhu^ christ wroughte here in earth: the
reysynge of lazar is pryncypally commended / And souereynly is to be
considered. not oonly for the souerayn miracle it self / But also for many
notable things that befell in that miracle and diverse mysteryes / The which
saint / Augustyn clergeally treatyth by lon long process upon the same
gospel / Of the which somewhat I shall towche in party: and more over as the
grace of our lord Jhu^ woll send wit perteynyng to the purpose / And for
asmoche as the gospel makyth mind of ui. deed bodies raised by our lord
Jhesu fro death to life. of the which two the first is not spoken of
specially in this treatise before / Therefore it semyth co^uenyent to this
purpose so^what touch of hem in this place. as the forsaid saint austin does
/ And first we shall vndstonde and have in mind that as the deeds of our
lord Jhu^ after his manhede ben ensample to us for to follow him as in
mekenes: pouertee pacyence and other virtues. so in his miracles done by
virtue of the godhe de: we shall not desire to follow him for to do as he did.
but we shall worship him as almighty god. and in that party and more over
coueyte for to understood the ghostly meaning of hem. how the miracles done
than bodily / And in bodies ben now done often times in ghostly men^es souls.
and so as saint augustyn says. by tho three bodies the which our lord Jhu^s
raised fro death to life bodily. ben vnderstonden three manner of deed souls.
the which through his special grace he reyseth every day to everlasting life
ghostly. for as y^ gospel makith mind he raised the daughter of the master of
the temple that lay deed in the house / By whom is understand dedely sin
only in assent without the fulfyilynge thereof in deed / Also he raised the
wydowes sone borne deed on the bear without ye yates of the cite. by whom is
understand dedely syn^e without forth performed in deed / And the third deed
body he raised that was lazar buried and four days deed: by whom is tokened
dedely syn^e in custom / For if we take good head and understand that syn^e
is death of the soul / we may find that the soul is deed ghostly and slain
through syn^e in thise three manners / First by full assent of will to do that is
forboden of god only within fourth in the soul without the deed thereof
without forth. As by ensample of lechery that is forboden what time as our
lord says in the gospel that when a man sees a woman lustely to y^ end for
to have to do with her flesshly and fully assentith thereto in his will. though
y^ deed follow not after he is acou^ted as a lechout in his heart. and so is
his soul slain ghostly through y^ assente and deed in goddis syghte / And this
manner of ghostly death is understood by that first deed body that our lord
Jhu^s raised in the house that was the daughter of the prince of the synagoge or
the master of the temple as it is said before / Of whom the gospel tells
that he came to our lord Jhu^ prayenge him that he would come to his house and
hele his daughter that lay seek therein / And as our lord that of his great
grace and endless goodness was ever ready to help and to hele all tho that
asked him truly was going with him toward his house / There came word to the
forsard prince yt his daughter was deed / And therefore they bode^ him ye be
should not make the master that is Jhu^s traueyle in vain. for they trowed
well yt he was of might to hele the seek. but not to reyse the deed /
Nevertheless our lord Jhu^s let not for her mysby leave: ne for her scornynge
to do his grace. but badde the fader that he should not dread. but only
believe / And wha^ he came to his house and found there after her custom many
weeping and mournful mynstralsy. and other array for her exequyes. he said to he^
wepeth not. for the wenche is not deed: but slepyth. and then^e they scorned
him / For they understood not what he meaned. for though she was deed as to hem
/ Nevertheless to him that was of might to reyse her and make her to live. she
did but sleep / And then^e putting out all that were in the house sauf ye
tader and the mother and the three apostles / Peter James and John Our lord
Jhesus badde the we^che to rise / And anon she rose up fro death to life / And
after ete and was all hool / This is the process of the gospel after the
understanding of the letter / In the which we may ghostly understand first
that as our lord god then raised bodily the daughter at prayer and by the
faith of the fader. so he reyseth now often times ghostly deed soul by syn^e
to life of grace through the prechynge and prayeng of holy men and the faith of
holy church / And as our lord Jhu^s spared not for mysbyleue and scornyng of
other to help him that asked his grace. so should not me^ spare to profit to
other souls / And namly men of holy church spare to preche goddis word when
it lo^geth to her office in to reysing of deed souls to ghostly life. though
some men scorn hem. or reprove hem therefore / For as saint augustyn say the.
It falls all day that a man that is ghostly deed by full assent in his heart
to dedely syn^e by the prechyng of gods word is compu^cte in his heart
thereof thorugh grace as though he herd our lord bydde him rise / And so is
he raised in his soul by repentance fro death to life. As it were in the house
or yt he be borne without by the deed. more over of that syn^e / And this is
the first manner of dedely sin and lightest for to rise out thereof through
grace that is betokened by the first deed bo die raised of Jhesu in the house
as it is said. But nevertheless this manner of dedely syn^e that is only in
assent is most perilous if it long abide / And specially if it be ghostly as
hye pride or envy / For as saint gregory says that sometime it is more grievous
syn^e in gods syghte pride by delyberaco^n in heart than is the deed of
lechery / And yet aldaye that one is greatly charged. that is to say lechery.
but that other seldom or lityll / And therefore ben many men here deceived / But
now pass we here over / Of the reysynge of the second deed body is written in
ye gospel of saint luke / How what time our lord Of (...). deed bo d(...)
Jhu^s came to a cite that was named Naym and his disciples with him and much
people. he met at yate of the cite a deed body borne on a bear that was the
allone sone of a widow that came with the corse. and much folk of the cytee
with her / And then^e our lord having pity of the great soro we of the
wydowe. and meued through his endless mercy. badde her yt she should not weep /
And then nighyng and towchyng the bear / And therwyth they that beren it
standinge still he spoke to the body in these words / Thou young man I say to
the arise up. and anon he rose fro death to life. and went on his fete. and
began to speak / And so he betoke him to his mother alive / This is ye process
of the gospel foresaid / O lord Jhu^ much is thy mercy showed to sinful man:
in the which as thou reysedest that deed body borne out toward beryeng with
out prayer made to the before only styrynge thyn endless godenes and pity / So
thou reysest all day ghostly hem that be^ deed in soul by great sins
flesshly and ghostly. yeuyng thy grace often times before or thou be prayed or
sought by any deserte: through the which sinful men be styred to repentance
and forsakyng of syn^e / And so by shryfte and penance doing after the laws
of holy church they ben raised ghostly to life of grace that first were deed by
syn^e performed in deed / And if it so be that this sin be openly known in
to the evil ensample of other and sclau^der. then it is need of open penance
as holy church has ordained after that our lord Jhu^s yaue ensample in that
open reysynge of the foresaid deed body that was openly borne deed on y^ bear
without forth in y^ sight of the people /

But now as to our princypall purpose for to speak of y^ reysynge of the iii.
deed body: that is to say Lazar four days deed / For asmoche as in this
process ben many fair and great notable things / Therefore we shall here more
specially gader in our entente and make us by ymagynaco^n as they were present
in bodily conuersaco^n: not only with our lord Jhu^ and his dyscyples. but
also with that blessed and devout meyne / That is to say martha and mary and
Lazar that was specially beloved of our lord Jesu: as the gospel wytnessith
And first we shall understand and have in mind the process of the next
chapyter before this / How upon a time when our lord Jhu^s walked in the
temple / That is to say in that place that was called salamons porche in the
feste of the dedicacyon of the temple / The Jews camen about him as
rauysshynge wulues or wood dogs with great ire gren^ynge upon him and saying
in thise manner words / How long wolt thou make us in suspe^se and in dwere in
our hertes. what thou art / If thou be christ tell us openly / This they
sayden by false and malycyous intent. to that end: yt if he had openly
knowleged that he was criste that is to say enoynted king then^e for to have
taken him and accused him as a traytoure to cezar the emperor of rome / But
therefore our lord Jhu^s knowing her falls ymagynaco^n tempred wysly his
ansuere. and as an In^ocent lamb among so many trechours wulues sobyrly and
mekely said to hem again / I speak to you and ye leave me not / But the work
that I do in the name of my fader. tho beren wytnes of me what I am / And
after more over when he said / I and my fader am alone. they token up stones
to have stoned him as a blasphemer. making him self god / And ferdermore when
our lord had concluded them in that party by reason and auctorytees of holy
wrytt that they might not again say. and they notwythsto^dyng his reasonable and
meke ansuere and so goodly words contynueden and encreasen in her malice /
For asmoche as the time of his passion was not yet comen. and for to give
ensample of penance* and of yeuynge stead to woodnesse: he withdrewe him out
of her hondes. and went with his discyples beyond Jordan in to y^ place:
where John baptized first about xviii. mile fro Jherusalem / And there he
dwelled awhile with his discyples / And in that time soon after as the gospel
tells now to our purpoos lazar the brother of martha and mary before said
wexed sore sike / And anon y^ two systers senden word to Jesu where he was in
that foresaid place beyond Jordan saying to him in this manner / Loo lord he
that thou loueste that is lazar is sore seek / And they sayden no more / For
asmoche as he^ thought that y^ suffised to him that loved and wist what they
meaned / And also perauenture for they knowing y^ malice of the Jews against
him to his death. and how a lityl before they would have stoned him. they durst
not call him to hem: but com^ytted all to his will / And then^e Jhesus said to
hem / This infirmyte is not to death: but for the praysyng of god that goddis
sone be glorified thereby / The gospel tellyth yt he said thise words to hem.
but it specifyeth not to whom for the sisters that senden to him were not that
time present but a great way fro him as it is said / Nevertheless we may
understand as by the process that he ansuerde to hem in these words by the
messager. or else said to his discyples or to both as it is most lykely / O
lord what comfort was this to y^ systers when they herd of the messager
thise words that Jhesus said. this Infirmyte is not to death understanding
peraue^ture by him y^ her brother should not deye bodily by y^ Infirmyte But
what discomforte was it to hem after when he was deed and beryed not
understanding that our lord meaned of that glorious reysynge that followed
after nor trowynge then that it should have fall / Nevertheless that
dyscomforte for ye time was after turned in to more comfort than they desired
First by that they would have had him preserved fro the death and helyd of his
Infyrmyte by our lord Jhu^s / Thus it fallyth often times with hem that god
loves and ben in trybulacion or disease. our lord god grau^teth hem not that
comfort that they aske^ and desyren but suffers hem as for the time to be in
dispeyre of her desire / And after when his will is. he fulfylleth her desire
better than they would first. and torneth her disco^forte in to more comfort
than they would have ymagined or thought / Ferdermore as to the process of
the gospel after our lord was certifyed of the seek Lazar. and had ansuere as
it is said: he dwellled still in the foresaid place two days. and af^ he said
to his discyples / Goo we again in to Jewery. and they aferde of this word
sayden to him / Master right now the Jews would have stoned the there. and
now wolte thou goo again thither / And then^e Jhu^s ansuerde again / Ben there
not twelve hours of the day: as who says. why ben ye aferde supposyng that
the Jews contynue^ in her malice / wete ye not well that as often times as the
hours chau^gen on the day so often man^es heart and purpoos varyeth and
changes / But the goostly meaning of these words as saint austyn expowneth
is this / Our lord understanding himself as the day and his twelve discyples
as twelve hours of y^ day. reprehended her mysbileue and her unreasonable
dread of his death that was in his will that they would give counsel to him as
men to god dyscyples to the master: the servants to her lord. and the feeble
and seek to him that was sovereign leche / wherefore in manner blamyng hem our
lord said to hem in this manner sentence / Are there not twelve hours of the
day who so walkyth in the day he offends not or erreth not / Follow ye me.
if ye woll not err and will ye not give counsel to me sythen it is need to
you to take counseyle of me / And therefore sythen it is so that I am the day
and the hours: and by kindly reason the hours folowe^ the day. and not the
day the hours / Follow ye me: and that if ye woll not offend or err / And
after this our lord Jhu^s knowing in spirit that lazar was deed. said to hem
/ Lazare our friend slepyth. but I woll goo for to wake him and reyse him fro
sleep / And then^e the discyples understanding flesshly tho words of kyndly
sleep sayden* Sire if he sleep it is a token yt he shall be hole and saaf of
his sykenesse. For comynly by way of kind. sleep of seek men is token of hele
following / But Jhu^s meaned of his death* And so here we may see the great
homelynes of our lord with his discyples that as in manner of bourdyng spoke
with he^ here* But after declaring to hem openly that he spoke first
mystly*sayd Lazar is deed. and I am glad for you: that thereby. your bileue
may be encreced and strengthed: knowing that I was not the^ in time of his
death. and so the rather byleuynge that I am goddis sone / Ferdermore leuynge
many words of the gospel and taking that semyth most notable to our
edyficaco^n. aft wha^ our lord Jhu^s with his disciples turned again toward
Bethanye. and the two systers hadden word of his coming Martha an one went
against him: but mary satte still at home till after she was called forth by
the biddynge of Jhu^s. An so it semyth by thise words specially after y^
letter telling how these ii. systers martha and maria dyuersly hadden he^ as
anenst Jhu^ / That John theuangelist meaned ghostly here as he does in other
places the diverse condico^ns that longen to hem that been in thise ii. astates:
that is to say of actyf life and conte^platyf life / For it is no doubt but
that mary loved Jhesus as much as her sister martha or more / And was as
glad of his coming / And as sorry was for her broders death and as fervently
desired his life? why then^e went she not anon with her sister out against
Ihu^. but in figure and for ensample that they that been in the state of
conte^platyf life shall not take upon hem bodily exercise of the deeds of mercy
as for to goo out to vysyte the seek or hem that been in prison / Or to tede
the hu^gry or clothe the naked. and so forth of other / Or else for to preche
or teache. or to mynister sacraments of holy Nota
church. but it so be y^ they ben called out thereto by the biddyng and the
auctoryte of holy church in Ihu^s name ghostly. as mary was bodily: sittynge
mary at home as it is said. and martha going out what time she met with Ihu^.
she fell down at his fete and said / Lord if thou had ben here my brother
had not be deed / Nevertheless and now I wot well that what so ever you ask
of god. god wolle it give the / She durst not say utterly that she desired
Inwardly saying as thus / Now reyse my brother fro death to life. for she wist
not whether it were expedient that her brother should be raised: or whether it
were Ihesus will / And therefore she set her words discretly in this manner of
meaning / Lord I wot well thou may reyse him. and therefore if you wylt it
shall be done. but whether you wylt or not I committee it to thy dome and not to
my presu^pco^n / Then^e said Ihs to her yt her brother should rise fro death to
life so in general words that it might be taken in two manners for to prove her
bileue of the fynall resurrecco^n not specifyeng whether he would reyse him at
ye time or none / And therefore martha taking that part y^ she was syker of
after the believe said. yt she wyste well that he should rise in general
resurrecco^n at last day of dome / And ferdermore at asking of our lord
whether she bileued that he said of himself yt he was resurrecco^n and life and
of everlasting life of all he^ that byleueden sothfastly in him. she answerde
finally thus / I believe that thou art criste goddis sone y^ art come in to this
world for man^es sauaco^n And then^e at bidding of Ihu^s: she went home* and
called mary her suster in scilence. that is to say in soft spekyng saying to
her Our master is comen. and calls the to hun. and anon ^he rose up and
went to him / Loo how expressly here also is tokened ghostly. what longs to
the contemplatyf life: that is to say: first in rest and pees scylence and
soft speech / And not low de cryenge or great noys. as the world uses / And
ferdermore what time that our lord Ihu^ calls him out by obedyence to cure
and to gouernayle of other as in the office of prelacy that then^e by ensample
of mary anon he rise by applyenge of his will to goddis will. love he never
so much rest. o^ have he never somoche in sweet contemplaco^n. That is
understand* what time he is called so utterly that if he wythsto^de it. he
should syn^e dedely by Inobedyence / Ferdermore we may see by the process of
the gospel the special love and homlynes that our lord Ihu^s had soueraynly
to mary in that he abode stylle there as martha met first with him. and
would not do as to the reysynge of lazar unto the time that mary was comen /
And then^e when she was comen and fallen down at Ihu^s fete. and with sore
weeping teeres had said as she did before. that if he had be there her brother
had not be deed Our lord Ihu^s seenge her weeping. y^ he loved so specially.
and also the Jews weeping ye there were comen at yt time to comfort mary: he
wept also / And that for iii. causes / First for y^ love y^ he had to mary
specially and to her sister and to lazar / Also to N^b^
show the greuousyte of syn^e in custom / And of the ghostly death there
through* that is tokened in lazar four days deed and beried / And the third.
for the mysbileue of hem that there were. the which byleued. that he might
have kept him fro death but not that he might then^e reyse him to life again /
Who so woll then^e Inwardly take heed and behold. how our lord Ihu^s wepith.
the sisters wepe^. the Jews wepe^. ye and as ^e Lacrime
ason tellyth the discyples wepe^. skylfully he may be stired to compassion
and weeping at leest Inwardly in heart namly for sin in custom that is so
hard to overcome. and to rise out of as our lord Ihu^s showed in ghostly
understanding. by the great diffyculte that he made as in weeping and in manner
of trowbling himself / And y^ two times wroth and grutching in spirit before
that he raised lazar. by whom is understood syn^e in custom as it is often
said: yeuynge ensample as saint austyn says Aug.
that thou that art ouerlayd with the heavy stone of dedely syn^e: be wroth and
grutche in spirit. and trouble thyself in this manner deminge thyself gilty /
And think how often you have sinned worthy everlasting death: and god of his
endless mercy has spared the and suffered the / How often you haste herd the
gospel forbedynge syn^e. and thou have taken no reward: but art contynuelly
contrary and falls to thy first baptysme / And then^e so thinking with
co^pun^co^n for thy syn^e* and as in manner askyng in thy heart: what shall I
do: whyder shall I goo / In what manner shall I escape this great syn^e and
dreadful peril of everlasting death / when thou say thus in thin heart:
then^e christ grutchith in the: for faith grutcheth / And if faith be in us:
then^e christ is in us: and so in this manner of grutching. is hope of vprisyng
For after this weeping and trowblyng as the process of y^ gospel / I tells.
our lord Ihu^s asked where they had put lazar: not for unknowing. but in
spekyng in manner of man: and in token ghostly of a strau^gnes of his grace to
hem that been ouerlayed with dedely syn^e for the time / Nevertheless he has
always co^passyon of the synful / And his mercy is ready to all y^ woll truly
ask it / For after he had asked where they had putt him. and they sayden again
/ Lord come and see. then^e he wept / And y^ Jews y^ there were sayden* loo
how he loved him / And so he showed the affecco^n yt he has to the sinful as
he says in y^ gospel / I came not to call the rightwis. but the syn^ers to
penance / But now goo we to y^ grave of lazar following our lord Ihu^ with all
that meyne. that is to say the two systers martha and mary and the apostles
and Jews many that were there yt time to comfort the systers / And as our
lord would to see and bear witness of that solemn and worthy miracle. and
so we may see by devout ymagynaco^n. how our lord Ihu^s gooth before between
the ii. sisters talking homly with hem. and they with him. showing to him the
great dysco^fort and sorrow that they hadden of her broders death / And specially
for asmoche as they durst not bydde him come to help hem: and keep him fro de
the for dread of the malice of the Jews that they knew had co^spired in to
his death: and how they were hyely comforted then of his presence / But
nevertheless therwyth they had great dread of him by cause of the Jews / And
then^e how our lord benyngly comforted hem again. and bad hem not dread of him
for all should be for the best and at the faders will / And so talkinge together
they camen to the grave that was covered with a great stone above / Then^e bad
our lord Ihu^s that they should take away the stone. and they abashed for
the great tender love that they had to him. dredynge the horribylyte and the
styuke of carayne that it should ought of fe^de him sayden* Lord now he
stynketh for he is iiii. days deed. showing thereby that they had none hope of
his living again / But our lord ayenwarde comforted her believe. and making the
stone to be taken away Afterward liftynge up his eyes to heaven said / Fader I
thank the. for thou herdest me. and sothly I wot well that thou herest me
ever / But I say this for the people that here stant y^ they believe that thou
haste sent me / And when he had said thus: he cried with a great voys: Lazar
come out of thy grave / O lord Ihu^ what need was the to cry / Sothly as
saint austin says to show in ghostly vndersto^ding how hard it is to augusti*
him for to reyse to life a soul: that is ouerlayed with the stone of dedely
sin in custom / How many ben there says saint Austyn in this people the
which ben ouerlayed with this heavy burden of wicked custom / Perauc^ture some
beren me that been overcome with lechery or gloteny that the appostle forbedeth
hem where he says thus / will ye not be dronken with wine in the which is
lechery / And they saying again Nolite i^: briari vi no
we may not. and so forth of other great misdeeds and wyckydnes that god
forbedeth and holy church / when it is said to hem does none of these. leest
ye peryssh. they ansuerynge and saying we may not leave our custom / O lord
Jhu^ reyse thise folk as thou reysedest lazar: for thou art sothly as the
resurrecco^n or vprisyng and life / How heuily this stone of wicked custom
ouerlayeth men in all degrees: not only lered and lewd seculers: but also
religyous nyghe by in all astates / who so woll speak N
against her wicked customs: he shall know sothly by experyence: and that there
is no remedy but only Jhu^ / O lord Jhu^ cry to all thise men with an hye
voys: yt is to say show thy myte and teyse hem to life of grace: putting
away that heavy stone of wicked custom: as thou reysedest lazar For after thy
cry and at thy biddyng he rose up and went out of his grave: but yet bounden
hondes and fete till he was losed and vnbou^den by thy discyples at thy
bidding / This is a great wonder as saint augustyn says to many men how he
might goo out of the grave with his fete bounden / But it is much more wonder
how he rose fro death to life. that was four days deed and beryed / And with
that body of a stynkynge careyne But what tokenyth all this says saint
Augustyn / Sothly this it tokenith when thou do a great syn^e by contempt
thou art ghostly deed / And if thou contynuest customably therein. then^e art
thou deed and beried / And when you forthinkest within forth: and shryuest the:
and knowlegest thy sin without fourth / For then rysest thou. and ghost out
of thy grave / For it is naught else to say goo forth out: but show and make
known outward that is preuy within forth / And this knowing and showing of
syn^e makyth only god cryenge with a great voys. that is to say with his
great grace calling / But N
yet though he that was deed. be raised and goone out of his grave /
Nevertheless he dwelled bounden. that is to say gylty in to the time that he be
losed and vnbou^den by goddis mynystres: to whom only he gaaf that power.
saying thus to hem All that ye unbind in earth shall be vnbou^den in heaven / All this N
says saint augustyn in sentence. In the which we may see openly a
suffycient auctoryte against hem that reprouen confession ordained by holy
church. and also the assoylyng of curates saying falsely that it is enough
generally to every man for to shryue him only in his heart to god / And that
prestes and curates of holy church have no more power to assoyle of sins than
a another man. but that god allonly assoyleth. and none other in his name / But
now leuyng the false opynyons. and go B
ynge to the end of our foresaid process. what time that Lazar was raised to
lif by our lord Jhu^s as it is said. and after vnbou^den by his discyples. he
and his systers with great Joye lowely thanked Jhu^s of that souereyn bienfete.
and ladde^ him home with hem to her house. making much myrthe / And then^e the
Jews that there were wo^dryng hyghly of that great miracle. some turned in
believe to Jhu^. and some yeden and tolden y^ pharisees that Jhu^s had done. and
so was it publyshed and openly known. in somoche that great multitude of Jerlm
and the country theraboute camen to sce lazar yt was raised / And then^e were
the princes of the Jews and the pharisees all confused: and thoughten and
casten for to slay lazar. by cause thorugh him many were converted to Jhu^ /
Now then^e for to make N co^clusio augusti.
a conclusion of all the process beforsayd of the three deed bodies raised by
our lord Jhu^. saint augustyn says in this sentence / All the foresaid things
we have herd bredern to that end y^ they that lyuen ghostly kepen hem in life
of grace / And they that been deed: rise up in this manner / First: he that has
syn^ed dedely by assent in heart and is not goon out thereof by perfor: mynge in
deed. amend him of that thought by repentance N
And so rise he up that was deed. within the house of his con science. Also he
that has performed in deed that he conceived dedely in thought. be he not in
dispeyre / But though he rose not within forth rise he without forth / So he be
not beryed and ouerlayed with the heavy stone of wicked custom / But
perauenture I speak to him. the which is ouerlayed with y^ hard stone of his
wicked manners and combred with the heaviness of custom / And so is as four
days deed and stynkyth. yet prouerbi orum xxi.
dispeyre he not / For though he be deep deed and beryed: criste Jhesus is
high of might and can break all erthly byrthen. cryenge through his great
grace and making him to life first by him self wythinforth. and after taking
him to his discyples for to unbind him. and so fully restore him to ghostly
life so that there shall be left no stynke of syn^e in his soul ghostli
notabil
no more than did lazar raised bodily. that he grant to al them that have
need Jhu^s christ /

How the Jews cou^seyled and conspired against Jhu^ in to his death / Eaplm
xxxv.
AFter the reysynge of lazar before said: when the time neyghed. in the which
our lord Jhu^s disposed to work our redempco^n. through the shedyng of his
precious blood. the devil fader of envy armed his knights and minysters and
whetted her hertes against our lord Jhu^ finally in to his death and specially
by occaso^n of his good and virtuous werkyng. but for soueraynly for the
reysynge of lazar envy kyndled in her hertes more and more. in somche yt they
might no longer bear her woodnes without execuco^n thereof against him /
wherfor^ the princes and the pharisees gadred a counsel against him. in y^
which counseyle cayphas bishop of that year: all thongh he meaned wickedly:
prophesied sothly that Jhu^s should dey for N
sauaco^n of mankind / And so have we here open ensample y^ wicked men and
reproved of god haven sometime the yefte of prophecy. and so by comyu assent
those falls princes and pharisees in that counseyle utterly ordained to slay
that Innocent lamb Jhu^ / And to that end leest all the people should believe
and tro we him / And then^e the romans as setting her law at naught. should
come and destroy both her temple and the people* O fools and folly counsel:
have ye not written of the wise man yt there is no wisdom ne counseyle against
god / And therefore pro^erbio ru^ (...).
it shall fall in contrary manner to your wicked intent as it is now performed
in deed / For there as ye slewen Jhu^ leest the romans should destroy your
place. and your people after befell* agaynwarde. that for ye slewe^ Jhu^. your
place and people was d^stroyed by the romans as the story tells of y^
destrucco^^ of Jhrlm by tyte and vaspasyane / In the same manner it falls of
te times in worlds wisdom / That is contrary to the wisdom of god / For often
times our lord god torneth in to the best that the world demeth as worst /
And specially there as envy is grounded of that entente of worlds wisdom as
it is showed openly by a notable ensample in Joseph. whom his brethren by
envy of worlds wisdom solden in to Egypt. as to his undoing / For they
would not worshypp^ him after his sweuen / But after it turned in to contrary
effect by god dis grace / For that showing of him was occasyon and cause of
his high auau^cynge / And her low submission to him and worshyppinge / And
so it fallyth all day men may see proved by experyence in the words
changed / But now leuynge this matere. and tournyng to our pourpoos of the for
said falls and enuyous councelynge. our lord Jhu^s everlasting wisdom of the
fader of heaven. to whom may no thing be hid: knowing this malicyous
conspirynge of the Jews against him / For as much as his time was not fully
come: in the which he disposed to suffer death for man^es sa^a: co^n. and also
to give ensample as it is said in the next chapter before to flee malice that
it encreace not by dwelling. he wythdrewe him for the time fro the Jews. and
went in to a country beside desert in to a cite that was called Effrem where he
dwelled with his discyples a lityll while: that is to say a seuennyghte / For
as some clerks sayen: he raised lazar the fridaye before the passion sunday
when the same gospel is read in holy church / And the saterdaye seuennyghte
after he was come in to bethanye as the process after declares /

How our lord Jhu^s came again to bethanie the saturday be for^ y^ palmsonday:
and of the supper made there to him: and of those things done thereat /

N
Our lord Jhu^s souereyne doctor and master of al virtues not only by word
techyng: but also by ensample yeuynge: B prude^cia
right as in the process before said to our edifycaco^n he used the virtue of
prudence in flee^g fro his enmyes / And there by shewyage that we also shall
wisely wythdrawe us fro y^ woodnesse of hem that pursewen us malicyously / That
is to say: the place and the time asks so now he used the virtue of ghostly
strength in this tornynge again to his enmyes wha^ the due time was come in y^
which he would by his free Fortitu.
will offer him to the passion / And strongly and myghtly suffer the malice of
his pursewers in to the vtterest end y^ was the hard death / Thus also he used
te^perau^ce a another time what time he fled eschewinge worlds worship. when
the people would have made him her king / And again ward he used ryt wysnesse
wha^ he would be worshypped as a king. as it follows herafter. what time the
people camen against him with branches of trees and other manner of great
reverence dooynge to him in the cite of Jhrlm / And ferdermore soueraynly he
used this rightwysnes after when he entered in to the temple. and sharply
reproved the couetyse of the prestes of the law and pharysees / And with a
scorge drove out the biars and sellars of goddis temple / And so used the
lord of virtues thise four pryncypall virtues. that is to say prudence and
temperaunce / Strength and rightwisnes for our doctrine and Informaco^n / where
fore as he shall not be supposed or demed as varyaunt or in constau^te. no more
shall none other that uses thise foresaid virtues after discreco^n as diverse
causes asken / But leuyng this matter wha^ our lord Jhu^s as it is said for to
offer him to the passion in time ordained of him before the world. cam^ N
again to bethany. that is to say: the sabbot next before palm sunday. the
which place is nighe Jhrlm as about the space of two mile. there they made
him a supper his true byloued friends that were full glad of his again
coming. and that in the house of Symond leprose that had that name for that he
was sometime before leprose. but not at that time: for he was heled of our lord
before / And there at that supper were thise homely ghestes with Jhu^: that is
to say: lazar: martha: and mary her sister / And as John notes specially
martha served and lazar satte at board with other that seten also with our
lord / But mary full of brennynge love to Jhu^ and taught wythinforth of the
holy ghost: took a full precious oynemente: and shed it upon his head. and
also enoyntynge his fete. Of the which precious oynement the sweet sauoure
filled all the house / Now let us abide here awhile: and take heed in N
wardly of the forsaid notable points / And first how our lord Jhu^s would
have this supper specially in that house of the foresaid symond that was a
pharisee. as it is said before: and in whose house that self mary enoynted him
with precious oynement: and with Inward sorrow and bitter teres of co^tryco^n:
but now more perfitly with unspeakable Joy and full sweet teres of deuoco^n. and
that knew well our lord before And for that one skylle he chose that place at
that time specially for mary's sake. as we may resonably suppose / For no
dowte that she loved specially that place. in the which she found first that
great grace of foryeuenes of her great sins as it is said. and so it was
more likyng to her there to do that excellent deed of deuoco^n. showing her
fervent love to Jhesu Also he would have that souper in Symonds house knowinge
his charity and true affecco^n co^tynued to him and to his dyscyples.
notwythstondynge the friendly reprehensyon before because of mary: and also for
the more open witness of ye true reysynge of lazar that ete and drank as other
did in that house of the pharysee openly. and in presence of many Jews. that
came^ at that time to see not only himself Jhu^. bnt also lazar as John
specially tellyth / And so we may see at that supper and in that house thife
four persons dooyng to our lord Jesu true service in diverse manners / That is
to say. the master of the house by charytable hospytalyte. lazar by open
witness of his true god bid / Martha by besy mynystrynge as longs to true
actyf life / And mary by fervent love and devout worshyppyng as longs to hye
conte^platyf life / But on that other side we may see in contrary manner other
yeuynge occasyon of offense to our lord Jhu^ by envy falls couetyse and
wro^gful demynge as enuyous / Judas that for to color his false couetyse
grutchynge as of lesynge somoche money spe^den in that precious oynement
pretended specially the releuynge of poor men thereby / And said yt it might
better have be sold for three hundred pens. and yeue^ to hem that neden / And
other also meued by his words: but otherwise and in good intent as it se: mith
for the poor men grutched. and were greatly styred against mary as for so
great a loss of that precious oynemente / But she keeping scyle^ce our lord
ansuerde for her as he did two times before. now reprehe^dyng hem and
declaryng that good deed ever to be had in mind. as in enoyntynge before of
his body into the beryenge that follows after / O lord Jhu^ how sorrowful and
disco^fortynge was this word. that so openly declares thy death: to mary
specially and to all other true friends that there were: but soueraynly to thy
blessid mother / For as we may sothly believe that word perced her heart more
sharply than any sword / And so then^e was al y^ myrthe of that feste turned
in to sorrow. and namly for asmoche as they knewen that the Jews had utterly
conspyred in to his death / But nevertheless that falls traitor Judas co^tynued
in his enuyous indignaco^n: and hereof he took occasion to betraey him and selle
him. as he did the wenesdaye next after for N
xxx. pens. whereof we shall speak herafter / Here may we ferdermore note
specially to our porpose that they are of judas part that reprehenden
almesdedes. offringes and other deuoco^ns of the people done to holy church
holding all such yeftes of devotion but folly. and saying that it were more
nedfull and better to be yeuen to poor men / O Judas thou that pretendeste
with thy mouth the releuynge of poor men there as sothly in the intent of thy
heart that is grounded in envy against men of holy church. it perteyneth not to
the of poor men* but rather thine own falls couetyse in excusaco^n of thy
nyhgonrre N. (...)
that have no deuoco^n. and naught woll give of thyn own good / For experyence
openly techeth that comynly all such Judas fellows ben as coueytous or more
than any other And that shall he find sothly in deed: who so has to do with
he^ in one manner or other / We reden in the gospel of our lord Jesu in diverse
places and specially now herafter against his passion that he reprehe^ded
sharply the scrybes and the pharysees of te times: namly of couetyse / But we
find not therefore that ever he bad ye people to wythdraw either dymes or
offrynges or other yeftes of deuoco^n done to hem. but aye^warde bad he^ always
do her dewte after the law: and commended her free deuoco^n in offrynges as
it is openly showed in y^ gospel of mark and of luke. wha^ our lord Jhu^s
beheld how rich me^ put heryeftes or offrynges to y^ temple in to the arche
y^ was called tresory. or a coufre having a hole above in manner of stocks y^
ben now used in chirches: the which arche was called Ga^ophilaciu^ / And
among hem he saw a poor wydowe offrynge two mynutes: the fourth part of a
sycle. and that was the substauuce of her lyuelode / And then^e our lord not
reprehendyng one or other: but rather co^mendyng: soueraynly praised the poor
wydowe for her great deuoco^n. and said y^ her lityll yef te in goddis sight
passed all ye great yeftes of the rich men / Here may we see if we take good
head to all ye circustances y^ by this only process and sentence of our lord
Jhu^s judas and his fellows ben sufficyently reproved and confounded in her
falls opinion and doctrine before said ayenste holy church / But now leuyng
this process torn we again to bethanye ymaginynge how our lord Jhu^s after
the foresaid supper in the house of si monde went with lazar and his systers to
her house. the which was his common hostrye. and namly tho few days folowyn ge
in to his passion / For there he ete on days and slept in nygh tes with his
discyples: and his blessed mother with her sisters: for they worshipped her
soueraynly as worthy was. but specially mawdeleyne y^ would never depart fro
her / Then^e among those his true friends our lord said that they should not
be tomoche abashed or distourbled with that uncouth de de to come. told hem
that he would on the morrow goo openly in to Jhrlm / And then^e were they all
soueraynly aferde. and prayden him hertly and his mother also namely: that he
would not put himself so utterly in to his enmyes hondes: and sothly
ferdermore in to the death that was conspyred without faylle against him of y^
Jews / But our lord god co^fortyng hem againward: badde hem dread naught: and
said it is the faders will that I take this Journeye: and he shall keep us and
so ordeyne for us at this time: yt ye shall see me among al mine enmyes in the
grettest worship that ever ye saw me: and they shall have no power now
against me / But after that I have done all that I will: tomorowe at even we
shall come hyder again sauf and sound / And then thorugh these words they
were all well comforted / But nevertheless always dredynge /

How our lord Jhu^s tame to Jherusalem upon palmsonday Caplm xxxvii.


THe sunday after erly upon the morrow our lord Jhesus dysposed him as he had
said to goo in to Jherusalem in a new manner and an uncouth other wise than
ever he did before / But to fulfill y^ prophecye of zacarye y^ prophet* said
to that pourpoos / And when he with that lytill but blessid company cam^ to a
place in mids y^ way that was called bethfage / He sent two of his discyples
in to Jherusalem. And badde hem bring to him an ass and her fool that were
te^ed the re in the common way and ordained to serve poor men at her need that
had none bestes of her own / And when they were brought. and the discyples
had laid her clothes upon hem / Our lord mekely set him first a lityl
while upon the ass and after on the fool ridynge in that simple array took his
way forth in to Jhrlm / O lord what syghte was this to see y^ king of kyngis
and lord of all the world ride in such array namly in to that solemn cytee
of Jherusalem / But sothly this thou dydest as all thyn other deeds to our
enformaco^n and en sample / For we may see and understand. that in this manner
of worlds worship taking. thou dispisest fully all the po^pe of vain
worlds worship hauyuge instead of golden har neys and curyous sadels and
bridels. simple clothes and hem proyn helters / And when the people herd of
his coming by cause of that great miracle that was publisshed before of the
reysinge of lazar they we^ten against him. and receyueden him as king with
ympnes and songs. and great Joys strewynge in his way her clothes and
branches of trees / But with this Joye our lord meaned sorrow and weeping / For
when he came nyghe the cite: he wept thereupon saying before the destrucci on
thereof that came after. and sorowynge for her ghostly blind nesse / For we
shall understand that as holy writ makyth mind our lord wept notably three
times / One time in the Primo
death of lazar. the wretchydnes of mankind whereby he is neded to death for the
first syn^e / A another time he wept for the Secu^do
ghostly blyndenes and vncu^nynge of man as now at this time of hem that
dwellen in that cite of Jherusalem. that wolden not know the time of her
gracyous visytaco^n / And therefore after was to come to that cite her utter
distrucco^n / The their de time he wept for the great trespaas and malice of
man / And Tercio
that was in time of his passion, hangyng on the cross for he saw that his
passion was sufficyent for redempco^n of all men. but nevertheless it took not
effect of profit in all for not in reproved and hard hertes and obstynate to
do pena unce that woll not forthynke and amend hem of her sins / And of
this wepinge spekith the appostle poul when he says that Jhu^s in time of his
passion with a great cry and weeping teres was herd of the fader for his
reverence / And of these three weeping times holy writ spekyth / Also holy
church Quart.
makith mind that he wept the fourth time. and yt was when he was a young
child / And that weeping was for to hyde fro the deuilles the mysterye of his
Jncarnaco^n / Behold we now our lord Jhu^s so weeping: and that not
feynyngly but effectuelly and largely with a sorrowful heart specially for her
dampnaco^n without end with the destrucco^n tem porell of hem: and of her
cytee / And as we may sothfastly trow. his dear mother and all that company
seenge him weeping so might not conteyne hem fro weeping at that time and no more
should we seen loss of souls / Thus our lord Jesus riding on the ass. and
having instead of princes earls and borons his poor and simple discyples
about him with his mother and other devout wym^en following: entered in to that
solemn cite. and also the people doing him great worship as it is said before
/ Of the which coming all the cite was greatly styred / And so went he first
in to the temple and cast out thereof the byars and sellers against goddis
laws. as it is said here before in the xxxii. chapter / And there was he
stondin ge openly in the temple prechynge and ansuerynge to the princes and
pharysees all that day. till it drew toward even / And so he and his
discyples stondyng all the day fasting after the great worship before done:
there was not one y^ would bydde him ones drink / wherefore at even he went
with his discyples to his homely hostry bethanye gooynge so symply thorugh the
cite with that lityll company: that came on the mo row with so great worship
/ And here may we consider y^ it is lityll to charge and lityll force of
worlds worship that is so soon done and so lightly passes away / But what
Joye trow we that his mother and mawdeleyne and other true fre^des hadden when
they saw him so worshypped of the people. and namly at night when he was come
with his disciples sauf and in prosperyte to bethanye / Sothly. he alonly
knowyth our lord Jhu^s that ever blessed be with end /

AMEN
What our lord Jhu^s did from palmsonday in to the thursdaye after next
sewynge / Caplm xxxviii.
Our lord Jhu^s full of charity and well of al charity willing to show both in
word and deed his sovereign charity as well to his foes as to his friends. and
desirynge that no man should be lost. but al saaf / when it drew to the end
of his dedely life here and of his passion time was nyghe at hand he traueyled
besily in prechyng and techyug openly to y^ people and specially in thise three
days / That is to say first on the sunday. at it was now last treated. and
after on the monday seweng. and the tewisdaye together / In the which days he
cam^erly upon the morrow in to the temple: and there continued in prechyng and
techynge to the people. and disputynge with the scribes and pharysees / And
ansuerynge to her disceyuable questions and many subtle temptynges: and so he
was occupied fro the morrow unto the euentyde / when he went with his discyples
to his rest at his homly hostrye with lazar and his systers in Bethanye as it
is said before / But for asmoche as it were long process to trete in special
of all tho matters that time between our lord Jhu^s and the Jews. and lettynge
fro ye purpoos that we be^ now in of the passion / Therefore passinge over all
the parables and ensamples by the which our lord reprehe^ded the Jews and
other process of that time in spe: syall: we may in general consider and
note on yt one side how the princes and the pharisees seenge the favor of the
people to Jhu^ / And therefore dredynge to perform her malice against him
openly. casten sothly and fully to take him in word either against her law* or
else against the trybute paid to the emperor of rome. whereby they mighten
accuse him as worthy the death / But our lord to whom all the preuyte of
man's heart is open knowing the subtylte and the malice of hem ansuerde wisely
to all her questyons. and so covertly in trou the set his words. that they
were sufficye^tly answerde. and yet they myghten not have her intent in any
part / But at the last they were so confounded that they durst no more ask oni
questyon of him / And then after our lord Jhu^s sharply reprehended the
pride the ypocrysy. the couetyse. and other wicked condyco^ns of hem: and
specially of the scrybes and pharisees sa yenge to hem in thise words / woo to
you scrybes and pharisees that louen worldly worshippes in many manners. and so
fourth of other vices / Nevertheless he badde therwyth the people that they
should keep and fulfill all her techynges. but that they should not follow her
works and evil living / At last rehersynge the unkindness of the Jews
against god in general by name of the cite of Jhrlm for asmoche as he was so
often besi to gader hem togider as a hen^e does her chikens in to y^ way of her
sauaco^n. and they would not / And therefore tellyng hem before her destrucco^n
following temporell and everlasting he left hem and wythdrue him out of the
temple. and with his dys ciples and other many of the Jews that byleued on
him. he went in to y^ mount of olyuete where he taught he^ more over by
ensa^ples how they should dispose hem and make hem ready in to her last end /
And finally told he^ of the day of dome. in y^ which good men y^ should
befou^den on the right half of god should have everlasting life: and wicked
men on the lift ho^de everlasting sorrow and endless death / Thus made our lord
Jhu^s an end of this open prechyng to the Jews on the tewisday toward even.
and after in preuyte said to his disciples wete ye well. that after thise two
days pasch shall be made* and man's sone shall be bitrayed for to be crucified
/ A sorouful word this was to all his true discyples: but the false traitor
Judas full glad thereof / And thinking anon by Instygaco^n of sathanas that
was entered in to his heart: how he might by occasion of his death fulfill his false couetise / And herupo^ he slepte not. but anon on the morrow y^ was the
wenesday when ye princes of prestes with the aldermen and scrybes weren
tradicio d^^ fe^a qua^ta
gadred in cayphas house: the bishop took counseyle: how they might by
sleyghte take Jhu^s and slay him /. But not in the feast day: for dread of the
people / Judas aspyenge and knowinge this counsel went to hem and proffered to
take him to hem at her will: so that they would mede him: and do him why: and
they glad of his profer. granted and ordained to pare him thyrty great pens.
of the which every penny was worth ten common pens / As now our grote is worth
four common pens / And so falshede and couetyse malice and treachery were
accorded in to the death of Innocents / And then^e had that falls traitor his
covetous desire of the price of that foresaid oynement that be grutched for as
lost. that is to say: three hundred pens / And fro ye time he sought oportunyte
how he miyght bytraye Jhu^ without the presence of the people / And for quare ie
iunatur feria iiii
this bitrayeng of our lord upon the wenesday is that day resonably ordained
most of penance doing and abstynence in the weke after friday / This was the
process of that cursed part Judas and the Jews on yt wenesdaye. but on that
other part? what did Jhu^s and his blessid company that day. we find not
written express in the gospel / For soth it is yt he went not in to Jhrlm: ne
apered openly to the Jews that day / what trow we then^e that he did all that day / Me think it resonably to be trowed: yt he was* then^e for the most
part occupied in prayer for the performynge of redempco^n of mankind that he
came fore / and not only for his fre^des that trowed in him and loved him: but
also for his cruel enmyes: fulfillyng ye pefecco^n of charytee that he had
taught before to his discyples in prayer for her enmyes: and hem that shall
pursewe hem: and there with knowing and seenge in spirit the foresaid malice of
In das the traitor and the jews in that day: utterly cast against him and in
to his death / And so skylfully men may suppose that in that prayer to the
fader specially he said the psalm Deus laudem that dauyd said in prophecye of
him and of Judas and her other enmyes long time before / But then^e most
properly it was said of himself not desiryng by the words of yt psalm
vengau^ce of his enmyes as it semyth after the sentence of the letter. but
co^formyng his will rightwisly to ye will of of the fader: and prophecyeng the
rightwis punysshynge and vengau^ce. deseruynge of hem that so malicyously
conspired against him / And after obstynatly continued in her sin / And for
asmoche as that was the last day that he though to dwell in that manner of
bodily conuersaco^n with that good and byloued meyne lazar and his systers. he
occupied him that day the more specially with hem in ghostly comfort of hem by
his edifycature and holy words as he was wont always to do but now at more
leyser to stre^gthe hem and conforte hem against the great sorrow that was to
come after by cause of his passion / And soueraynly as we may trow in homly
comynyng with his blessed mother to her special comfort. and also with
mawdleyne specially that ever was thyrsty to drink of his sweet ghostly words
/ Of the which he give us taast and savor Jhu^s christ blessed without end

Amen /
Of that worthy supper that our lord Jhu^s made ye night before his passion:
and of the noble cyrcu^staunces that befell therwyth / Caplm xxxix:
When the time came: in the which our lord Jhu^s had disposed of his endeles
mercy. for to suffer death for man and shede his precious blood for our
redempco^n. it lyked him first to make a supper with his disciples. as for a
mind ever lasting of his great love to hem and to all mankind / And for to
fulfill the figure of the old law. and begin the troth of the new. and
perform the mysteryes that were to come. of his precious passion / This
supper was souerayuly worthy and wonderful and great. and wonderful things
were done there at / wherefore if we here take good intent with In ward deuo
co^n thereto. and to the things that our lord Jhu^s did thereat That curteyes
lord woll not suffer us to goo fasting therfro. but he shall feed us of his
grace. as we trustely hope. with N iiii. meditan da
much ghostly comfort thereof / We shall understand that four things
specially befell at this souper. of ye which In ward medytaco^n shall by
reason styre our love to our lord Jhesu and kyndle the ghostly fire of our
deuoco^n / The first is that bodily supper and the manner thereof in fulfyllyng
of ye law The second is the washing of the fete of the discyples by our
lord Jhesu / The third is the ordinance and the consecracyon of that
precious sacrament of his blessed body And the fourth is. that noble and
fructuous sermon. that he made to his discyples / Of the which four we shall
speak and Prim a medita co^decena
see by process and in order / As to the first that is bodily supper we shall
have in mind that peter and John at the biddynge of our lord Jhu^ yeden in to
the cite of Jhrlm: to a friend of hers that dwelled in that part of the cite.
that was called mount Syon. where there was a large house on lofte strewed and
able for to make this supper in / And so after our lord Jhu^s christ with
that other disciples entered in to the cite. and cam^ to that foresaid place or
house on the thursdaye toward even Now take here good head and behold with
all thy mind yt thou redeste or herest thise all that folowen that been told
or spoken or done / For they ben full liking and stiryng to great deuoco^n /
For in this process is the most strength and ghostly fruit of all the
medytaco^ns that been of the blessed life of our lord Jhesu. pryncypally for
the passing tokens and shewynges in deed of his love to mankind / wherefore
here we shall not abredge as we have in other places / But rather length it in
process / Now then behold our lord Jhesu after he was come to the foresaid
place: how he stant in some part by nethen* speaking with his discyples of
edifycacyon and aby dyng till it was made ready for hem in the foresaid house
alofte / And when all things were ready / Saint John that was most homly and
famylyer with our lord Jhu^: and that be sily went to and fro to see: that all
that neded were ordained and done. came to him and said / Sire ye may go to
supper wha^ye woll / For all things ben ready / And then anon our lord with
the twelve apostles went up / But Johan algate next him / And by his side
without departing /

For there was none that so truly and also famylierly drew to him and
followed him as he did / For when he was taken: he followed him when other
fled. and was present at his crucifyenge and at his death / And after he left
him not till N* de Jo ha^ne eua^ gelista
all was done and he was beryed / And so at this supper he sat next him
though he was younger than other / what time that our lord Jhu^s with his xii.
apostles cam^ up to the board where upon they should ete. first stondyng
therabout they devoutly sayden graces / And after he had blessid. they seten
down all N. de tabula in ^^n^
about that board: but John next Jhu^. and that upon the ground as the manner
was of old men before / But here we shall understand that y^ boorde was
square as men supposen made of diverse boordes Joined together / And as men
sayen* that hane seen it at Rome in the church of Latranensis. it conteyneth
in every part of ye four square. the space of two arms length. and somewhat
more / So that in every side of the square board the dyscyples saten as men
supposen. though it were streyghtly / And our lord Jhu^s in some angle. so
that they all might reche in to the mids: and ete of one dysshe / And
therefore they vndstode him not what time he said* he y^ with me puttith his
hand in to the dysshe or dobler: he shall bitraye me / Thus we may ymagyne
and suppose of the mane^ of her sittynge at the board / Also we may vndstonde
in the etynge of the paske lamb. that in that time they stoden about Agn^ pa
schal^s
the board upright: holdinge staves in her hondes after y^ bid dynge of moses
law that our lord came to fulfylle / So that though they stoden in that
time: nevertheless they seten also in other time: as the gospel tellith in
diverse places: and else might not John have laid his head: and rested him in
manner of lyggynge upon the breast of Jhu^ / what time the paske la^ be was
brought to the boorde roasted after the law: our lord Agn^ pa sc^al^s
Jhu^s that was sothfast lamb of god without wem^e of sin. and that was in
mids of hem: as he that seruith and minystreth: took the lamb in his blessed
ho^des: and cut it. And departed and yaaf it to the discyples. byddyng hem
ete it glad ly. and comfortyng hem with lovely chere / And though it so was
that they eten as he badde: nevertheless comfort might they none have: for
asmoche as they dradde always leest there should fall ought against her lord
in that nouelte / And so as they eten: he told hem the sorrowful deed more
openly: and said I have desired for to ete with you this paske la^be before I
suffer the death / For sothly one of you shall bytraye me / This speech went to
her hertes as a sharp sword / wherefore they ^essed of etynge and looked each
on other. and sayden to him / Lord whether I be he / Here if we take good
head: we owen to have Inward compassion both of our lord Jhu^ and also of
hem / For it is no doubt they were in full great sorrow / But the tray tour
Judas left not of etynge for thise words of bitrayeng should not seem as
perteynyng to him / Then^e John at instau^ce of peter asked of our lord and
said / Lord who is he y^ shall bytraye the / And our lord Jhu^s pryuely told
him. as to him that he loved more specially. and specifyed to him who was that
traitor / And John thereof greatly astonyed and wo^dred with great sorrow to the
heart* naught would tell peter / but turned him to Jhu^: and softely laid
down his head upon his blessed breast / And as saint augustyne says. our
lord Jhesu would not tell peter who was the traytoure / For and he had Aug:
in omelia di^it Je: sus petro
wyste it* he would have all to torn him with his teeth / And as saint
augustyn says by peter ben fygured and understood they that been in actyff
life: and by John they that been in con: templatyff* wherefore we have here
doctrine and figure: that he that is co^templatyff: medlith him not with
foreyne worldly deeds. and also he y^ sechith not vengaunce without forth of
the offe^ses done to god* but is sorry within forth in his heart. and torneth
him only to god by devout prayer / And the more sadly tornynge him. and
drawing him to god. commyttith all thing to his disposyco^n and ordenaunce.
though it so be that he that is co^templatyff sometime gooth out by zele of god
and profit of man's souls: as when he is called thereto / Also in that y^
John would not tell Peter: that he badde him ask of the traitor / we may
understand that the comtem: platyf shall not reuele the secret of his lord /
As it is written N. de sco^ fra^c^s^o
of saint fransoys that preuy reuelaco^ns he reveled not with outforth: but
what time that need made him for hele of man's souls. or y^ stirynge of god
by reuelaco^n meued him the^ to / Now forth in our process behold we the
great benygnyte of our lord Jhu^ that so homly suffered his der^ynge John
enclyne and rest upon his blessed breast / Lord how tenderly and truly they
loved together / This was a sweet rest to John. and a profitable to all christian
souls. in the which as clerks sayen he ^
drunk of that well of everlasting wisdom the precious drink of his holy
gospel. with the which after he comfor ^
ted al holy church: and yaaf it as triacle against y^ venym of diverse
heretics / Behold ferdermore other discyples full sorry of the foresaid word
of the bitrayenge of our lord Jhu^: not et^nge. but lokynge each on other as
they that wyste not what counceyle or comfort they might have in this caas.
And thus much at this time suffysith touching that first article of yt ^
bodily supper. and the etyng of paske lamb in fulfyllyng of the law. and
ending of the figure that our lord Jhu^s did it fore / And as clerks
sayen: we find not that our lord ete flesh in all his life. but oonly at
this time in etyng of that la^ be. more for mystery than for bodily fode /
Towchynge the s^d^ pedu^ abl^
second point: that is the wasshyng of the discyples fete: we shall
understand that after the foresaid process our lord Jhu^s rose up fro the
supper. and also his discyples anon with him B
vnwitynge what he would do ferdermore. or whether he would goo / And then^e
went he with hem down in to the nerer house under the foresaid lofte as they
sayen* that have seen that place: and there he bad al y^ disciples sytte a
down. and made water to be brought to him: and then^e he cast of his
ouerclothes that were perauenture combrous and lettynge to that he thought do:
and gyrde him with a lynnen cloth. and put himself water in to the bacyn yt
was of stone* as men say. and bare it and set it before peter's fete: and
kneled down for to wasshe hem / But Peter greatly abashed and astonyed of that
deed as no wonder was. first forsook to have that service of his lord as
Inconuenyent to him /. But after he herd his threte nynge that else he should
have no part with him in bliss turned his will in to better. and mekely
suffered him do his will Now if we give here good intent to the deeds of our
lord Jesu: and all that folowyth in this time: sothly we may with great wonder
be styred specially to the love and dread of him / For what was that to see the
king of bliss and high lord of mageste knele down and bow him to the fete
of a poor fysshar. and so forth to all other that there seten: and so with
the blessed hondes wysshe her foul fete. and after tendly Notahumilitat^ d^^
wyped hem: and more over devoutly kyssed hem / Soothly he yt was sovereign
master of mekenes showed us in this deed. and taught us a perfyte lesson
thereof / And yet morouer in yt he did that same low service to his traitor.
co^meuded soueraynly his passing mekenes / But woe to that hard heart ye
harder than the adamaunt: or any thing hardest: that melts not: or softeth
not with the hete of so great fire of charity and profou^de meekness / And
that dredeth not that lord of mageste in that deed: but ay^warde frowardly

of that traytoure Judas. ayenwarde when this washing was done in mystery as
it is said / He went again up to the place of the foresaid supper / and when
he was set with them. he told them the cause of the foresaid deed / And
that was that they should follow him in meekness each to other. as he gaaf hem
ensample that was their lord and master / And that they should not wasshe

other: as it is understand by his words that folowen after when he said to
hem / If ye known thise that I have done to you. ye shall be blessed if ye

he^ with the second mess of his precyons body: that was deynte of all
deyntes* as men vsen in bodily fedyng and festes f^^ste to be served with
boystous and homly metes. and after with more delycate and deynteous / whereof

est sacrament of Jhesus precious body / Lift we here our bertes soueraynly:
and bethynke we inwardly wondering of ye most worthy dygnacyon and vnspeable
charity. through the which he betoke himself to us. and left to us in to me^e
^ ghostly food making and ordeynynge that precious sacrament in this manner
/ When he had wasshen his discyples fete: and was goone up again with hem
there he before sat at the supper as it is said before: as for an end of the
sa^^^fyces of the old law and beginning of the new testament making himself
our sacrefyce. he took bread in his holy hondes. and lift up his eyes to his
fader almighty god. and blessed the bread: and said the words of the
consecraco^n therouer*. By virtue of the which words. bread was turned in to
his body and then he yaaf it to his discyples and said / Takes and eteth for
sothly this is my body that shall be take and give for you. And after in the
same manner taking the chalyce with wine said. takith and drynkith all hereof*
For this is my blood: yt shall be out shed for you and many other in
redempcyon of sins: and after he yaaf he^ power of ye consecraco^n and to all
prestes in hem. and said thus. does ye as often as ye take it in co^memoraco^n
and mind of me / Take now good here thou christian man* but specially thou
priest: how devoutly. how die ligently and truly thy lord Jhu^s christ made
first this precious sacrament / And after with his blessed hondes minystred it
and commyned that blessed and his byloued meyne / And on that other side take heed with what devout wonder first they saw him make that wonderful and
excellent sacrament / And after with what dread and reverence the y took it*
and received it of him / Sothly at this time they left all her kyndly reason
of man: and only rested in true believe to all that he said: and did believe
without any doubt* that he was god and might not err / And so must thou
do that wolte feel. and have the virtue and the ghostly swetnesse of this
blissed sacrament / This B
is that sweet and precious memoryale. that soueraynly makith man's soul worthy
and plesynge to god. as often as it is duly received either by true and devout
meditaco^n of his passion or else and that more specially in sacramentale
etynge thereof / wherefore by reason this excellent yeft of love should kyndle
man^es soul and enflam^e it all holy in to the yeuer thereof our lord Jhu^s
christ / For there is no thing that he might give and leave to us more
derworth. more sweet or more profy table than himself / For without any doubt
he that we receiuen in the sacrament of the altar is he that self goddis sone
Jhesus that took flesh and blood. and was borne of the vyrgyn mary. and that
suffered death on the cross for us. and rose the third day fro death to life.
and after styed up in to heaven and sittyth on the faders right side. and that
shall come at the day of dome: and deem all mankind / In whoos power is bo
the life and death: that made both heaven and hell. and that on^li may save
us or da^pne us ever without end / And so he y^ self god and man is contained
in that lityll oost that thou see in form of bread / And eueri day is
offered up to the fader of N
heaven for our ghostly hele. and everlasting sauaco^n / This is the true bileue
that holy church has taute us of this blessid sacrament / But yet more over
let us sit a lityll longer at this worthy lords boorde Jhu^s: and take we
head Inwardly of our ghostly food and comfort more specially of that
precious and most de^^teous mete. that is there set before us. that is the
blessed body of our lord Jhu^s in this holy sacrament beforsayd / And so by
inward co^sideraco^n taaste we the swetnesse of this heavenly fode: having
first in mind the gracious and reasonable making and ordenau^ce of y^ blessed
sacrament: and after ye great worthiness and merueylous werkyng thereof in chosen
souls to comfort and strengthyng of our faith / And as anenst ye first point
we shall understand. that almighty goddis sone the second person in trinyte.
willing of his sovereign charity and endless goodness to make us partyners of
his godhede: he took our kind and became man to make men as gods: and
ferdermore that he took of our kind that was flesh and blood. a^^e he yaaf
to us for our hele and our sauaco^n / For he offered to his fader of heaven upon
the altar of the cross: his blessed body for our reconcilynge. and he shed
his precious blood in to price for to bye us out of our wretchid thraldom. and
to was^^ us and make us clean of all sin / And for asmoche as he would that
the mind of that hye great benefyce should dwell in us euerlastyngly. he yaaf
to al christian people his body in to mete and his blood in to drink under the
lyknesse of bread and wine in manner as it is said before in the first making
of this blessed sacrament / But now here behold we Inwardly and take we head.
what wondering it was to the appostles then to see our lord Jhu^s very man
as they were sitting with hem bodily. and therewith holdyng in his hondes that
self body in that y^ semyd to her bodi^y syghte naught else: but bread
affermynge thus sothly / This is my body that shall be yeuen for you / And also
of that. that in the chalyce seemed oonly very wine / This is my blood that
shall be shed for remyssion of your sins / And so that self bodi that they
seen with her bodily eyes before hem was sothly under the form of bread / And
that self blood that was all hole in his bodi was there in the chalice in form
of wine / But then was not that bread as it semid: and as it was before the
words of co^secraco^n: nor wine as it semid in self manner. but only the
liknes or the form of bread and wine containing very crystes flesh and
blood as it is said / But what man^es wit or reason might comprehend at
this time / Sothly none / And therefore the true apostles at that time leften
all her bodily reason and wit: and rested only in true believe to her lords
worcester: des as it is said before: sauf Judas that was reproved for his falshede
and mysbyleue. and therefore he received that blessed sa: co^tra lol lardos
crament to his dampnaco^n / And so done all tho that be^ now of his part: the
which falsely bileuen. and sayen that the holy sacrament of the altar is in
his kind bread or wine as it was before the consecraco^n: by cause that it
semyth so to all her bodily feeling: as in sight taast and touching. the
which be^ more reprouable as in that part than Judas / For they seen not
Jhu^s bodily beside that sacrament as he did: and therefore it is lyghter to
hem for to believe: and more to her dampnacion if they believe not as god himself
and holy church has taught: namly sythen that true techinge of this blessed
sacrament has be holden steadfastly so many hundred years: and of so Fides
sacrame^ti
many holy men: marters confessors and other true christian men the which in to
her last days stoden without doubt in this faith: and deyden therein / The
which is this in few words that the sacrament of the altar duly made by
virtue of crystes words. is very goddis body in form of bread. and his very
blood in form of wine / And though that form of bread and wine seem as to
all the bodily wits of man bread and wine in his kind as it was before /
Nevertheless it is not so in so othnes: but oonli goddis flesh and blood in
substance: so that the accydents of bread and wine wonderfully and
myraculously against man^es reason and the common order of kind be^ there in
that holy sacrament with her kyndly subject and very cristes body that suffered
death upon the cross is there in that sacrament bodily under the form and
lyknesse of bread and his very blood under lyknes of wine substancyally and
holy without any feynyng or deceyte / And not oonly in figure as Not^
the false heretyke says / Thise terms I touch here so specially by cause of
the lewd lollardes: that medlen hem against the faith falsely / And more over
this before said faith of holy church touching this excellent sacrament
taught by holy doctors and worthy clerks* is confermed by many maneres of
miracles: as we reden in many books. and heren alday preche and taught / But
here laugheth the lollarde. and scorneth holy church in allegaunce of such
miracles. holding he^ but as mad tales and feyned Illusyons / And by cause
that he tastes not the swetnesse of this precious sacrament: nor felyth the
gracyous werchynge thereof in himself: therefore he loves not that any other
does. but here in confession of al falls lollardes. and in confort of all true
lovers and worshyppers of this holy sacrament. and princypally to the loving
and honor of the hye auctour and maker of our lord Ihu^s I shall sare more
over somewhat in special that I know sothly of the gracyous werchynge in
sensible felinge of this blessid sacrament: the which merueylously werching
and felyngeaboue comin kind of man shewyth and proves soueraynly the blessed
bodies presence of Jhu^ in that sacrament / There is one person y^ I know
living: and perauenture there ben many that I know not in the self degree or
higher: the which person of times when our lord Jhesus vouchesauf to touch
him of his grace in tretynge of that blessed sacrament with the Inward siyght
of his soul and devout meditaco^n of his presious passion Suddenly felyth also
shed in to the same body a Joye and likynge that passyth without comparyson
the highest likynge that any creature may have or feel as by way of kind in
this life. through the which Joye and likynge. all the members of the bodi
enflam^ed of so delectable and Joyefull hete that him thynkyth sensibly all
the body as it were meltynge for Joye. as wax does anenst the hot fire. so
ferforth that ye body might not bear that excellent likyng. but that it should
utterly faylle. nere the gracyous keeping and susteynyng of the towcher our
lord Jhu^ above kind / O lord Jhu^* in what delectable paradise is he for
the time that thus felith that blessid bodily presence of the in that precions
sacrament* through ye which he felyth him sensybly with vnspeable Joye as he
were Joined body to body / Sothly I trow yt there may no man tell it or
speak it / And I am syker that there may no man fully and sothfastly know
it. but he that in experyence felyth it / For without doubt this is specially
that hid man^a. that is to say the angels mete that no man knowyth: but he
that felyth it / As saint John witnessith in his apolipse / And he yt
soothfastly felyth it. may well say with dauyd the prophet soueraynly
reioycynge body and soul heart and flesh in god alive / O lord Jhesu how
much is the multitude of thy swetnesse Quam magna multitu do dulce dinis
that thou have hid to hem that in true love dreden the Thus have I
understand of the foresaid gracyous wonderful and myraculous worchinge of our
lord Jhu^. showing sensibly his blessed delectable bodily presence in that
most excelle^te sacrament of the awter in manner as the foresaid person that
felt it might tell it so in party. and as I cowde shortly and inperfectly
write it / The which myraculous worching to my understanding having
consideracyon to all cirstau^ce there of: passes many great miracles that we
rede^ showed in this holy sacrament / In asmoche as the wit of that bodily
felinge: passyth incertaynte the wit of syghte: and has less of strange
lyckenes and more of the self sothfastnesse / For what time that our lord
Jhesus apered in that blessed sacrament to stre^gthyng of believe. or to comfort
of his chosen derlynges. either in liknes of a lityll child: as he did to
saint edward king and confessor: or else in quantyte of flessh al blody: as
it is written in the life of saint gregory and other places / Sooth it is that
yt bodily lyknes seen in that quantyte: accords not with the very bodily
quantyte and shappe of our lord that henge on the cross: and that is sothly
in that sacrament fro the bodily syghte / But he that felyth that gracyous
yefte before said. has no strange bodily syghte of any lyknesse other than
sacrament in true believe. but in his soul lightened through special grace. he
sees inwardly with souerayn Joye that blessed body of Jhu^ christ right as he
henge on the cross without any deceyte. and therwyth in ye body / Also he
felyth sensibly the bodily presence of our lord Jhu^s in manner as it is said
before with so great Joye and likynge that there can nootonge tell it fully.
nor heart understand it. but only he that felyth it / And as it semyth that
Joyful felyng in the body is like to y^. that holy church syngeth of the
apostles and disciples at the feste of penthecoste when the holy ghost was sent
to hem suddenly in the lyknes of fire wythoutforth and unspeakable Joy in her
bodies within forth: that is. y^ her bowels filled with the holy ghost: Joyed
soueraynly in god / And so may he y^ Imple ta gaudent viscera
has that foresaid gracyous yeft. sothly say in that time with dauyd in
special manner. and high gracyous felyng / My heart and my flesh rejoiced
hem soueraynly in to the presence of god alive Jhesus / That blessed be he ever
and soueraynly for this hye feast of grace to man / But now seace we bear
awhyle of this delectable ghostly showing and treating of this most
deynteous and precious mete. and take we head ferde^r more to the noble lesson
that our lord Jhu^s taught his d^sciples therwyth after that worthy supper.
that is the fourth article beforsayd with purpose yet if our lord will send
grace to touch more of his precious sacrament. and that at last end of this
book as in conclusion of all the blessid life here bodily of our lord Jhu^
according so with the gracious and reasonable ordinance of holy church of the
worthy and solemn feste of this blessed sacrament as in a perfyte conclusyon
af all the festes of our lord Jhu^s. whose name be blessed ever wythouten
ending / Amen

Ferdermore to wchynge the fourth article* take heed thou christian soul y^ have
any light within the of the fire of love. how this sovereign scole master
Jhu^s made to his discyples a noble sermon full of ghostly swetnesse and
brennynge coals of love and charity / For when he had yeuen that blessed
sacrament to his discyples: and among other of his charity to his enmie that
wicked Judas* he said to him. that thou purposest to do quoth facis fac cicius
do it anon / As who says* I wo^e where abowte thou art and therefore
deliver y^ by time. understanding his bytrayeng. but N
there was none of his other discyples that wyste to what end B
Jhu^s said tho words / And anon this cursed traitor went forth to the
princes of prestes. to whom he had sold him y^ wenesdaye before as it is said.
and asked of hem company to take him / And in y^ mean time our lord Jhu^s
made this foresaid long and worthy sermon to his discyples / Of the which
profitable sentence co^mendyng pees to his discyples. we may understand all
the effect comprehended shortly that he informed hem specially and taught to
hem with pees three pryncypall caritas ma^datu^ nouu^ do vobis in hocco gnosca^t
oe^s qdm^ Si diligitis me
virtues / That is to say* faith hope and charity /

First he taught hem charity often times. and most besily. when he said / I
give you a new maundement. and that is y^ ye love together / And also in this
one thing soueraynly al me^ shall know that ye ben my discyples if ye have
love each to other / And also after how they should truly keep this charity by
worchynge in the love of him / He said to hem thus / If ye love me keeps my
hestes / And also after who so louith me he shall keep my word. and then
shall my fader love him and we shall come to him and dwell with him / And in
other diverse places specially he co^me^ded to he^ charity and pees as a
princypall byquest in his testament at this time. the process of the gospel
tellith / In faith also he informed he^: and stabled hem Fides no^ turbe ^ cor
ves
more perfitly in believe of his godhede saying in thise words Be not your
heart trowbled and dread it not* for as ye believe in god. so ye must believe in
me / And after he taught he^ in this believe y^ the fader and he be^ one god /
And though he be less tha^ the fader after the manhede: netheles he is ever
even with y^ fader after the godhede / And therefore he reprehe^ded phylip y^
bad him show he^ the fader: and said: that who that sees him sees y^ fader /
And after in concluso^n of this faith. he said to his di^ciples / Leave quivid^^
me vid^^
ye not that I am in the fader and the fader in me* else for tho works y^ ye
seen bileuith / In hope also he comforted he^ in many manners. and first
touching theffect of prayer: saying to he^ in these words / If ye dwell in me.
and my words dwell^ or abiden steadfastly in you / what so ever ye woll ask*
it shall be yeuen to you / Also he comforted her hope against tribulaco^s and
hate of the world. saying thus / If the world hate you: wytyth well that it
hates me first before you / And so forth as the text tellith co^fortynge
her hope in pacyence of persecuco^n by ensample of himself: that was her lord
/ In the third manner he comforted hem to hope without dispeyre by cause of the
with drawyng fro hem his bodily presence. telling hem before y^ they should
have great sorrow for thabse^ce of him through his hard death / But afterward
that sorrow should be turned into endless* Joye by his glorious resurrecco^n:
and ascenco^n to y^ fader* and sendynge of the holy ghost to hem* the which
should soueraynly comfort hem in all disease: and teache hem all sothfastnesse
/ And then^e he concluded in thise words / Al thise for said words I have
spoken to you unto that end y^ ye have pees in me / In y^ world ye shall have
sorrow and ang^iss^: but trus teth well by sad hope / For I have overcome y^
world: as who says: and so shall ye / And after this our lord Jhu^s turned
his speaking to the fader. lyftyng up his lovely eyes to heaven: and co^mendyng
first himself after the manhede. and after prayenge tenderly for his discyples
/ And ferdermore prayeng not only for he^: but also for all he^ that should
believe on him after thorugh her word / And in to that end at last y^ al might
be oned togider in true love and charity. as the fader in the sone. and the
sone in y^ fader: so they al in one god. fader. and sone. and holy ghost / O
lord Jhu^ how wonderfully perceden thise foresaid words the hertes of thy
disciples / For sothly they loueden the so ferue^tly y^ they might not have
borne hem ne had been the special preseruinge of thy grace / And who so has
grace Inwardly to bethink ^ dilyge^tly to discuss all the process of this
blessed and worthy sermon: skylfully he shall be styred in to the bren^yng love
of Jhu^. and likyngly rest in the swetnesse of his blessed doctrine / And on
that other side: who so takyth head to his disciples how they stonden
sorowfully hangyng down her hedes. and we pyng and highly sighing: resonably he
may be styred to great compassion* and specially for John. y^ was famylier
most with Jhu^. and that took good head specially before other to all that
Jhu^s spoke. as he was chosen by special grace only to wete sothly the
foresaid sweet words of Jhu^ to edifyenge of al holy church. and our high
comfort / Ferdermore among other words of Jhu^: we reden that he said to his
discyples / Ryseth up and goo we hens / O dear god? what dread entered then^e in
to hem: not knowing whither they should goo. and greatly dredinge of his
departinge fro hem / Nevertheless he spoke to hem after fulfyllyng the process
of his sermon going by the way and they besily taking head to it / Now
behold how y^ disciples folowen him: and in manner of chike^s y^ folowen the
hen^e. and put ten her hydwardere and thither ward for to come under his wings
so they besiden hem now one: and now a another to here and to be next him. and
that he suffered and lyked well / At last wha^ this sermon was done and all the
mysteryes fulfilled: he went with he^ in to a yerde or a gardine over the water
of cedron ther^ to abide his traitor Judas and other armed men*wherof it shall
follow herafter in the process of his passion / Here may we have in mind that
our lord Jhu^s yaaf us ensample in this eue^ tide and night of v. great
virtues. that is to say / First of profou^de meekness as it is said in the
wasshing of his discyples fete / After of souerayn charity in the excellent
sacrament of his blessed body. and in that sweet sermon full of bren^yng coals
of charity / And the third of passing pacyence in so benygne suffrynge of
his traytoure. and all dispyte done to him after / The fourth of perfyte
obedyence in taking wylfully y^ hard passion and bitter death after the faders
will / And y^ fy^th of devout prayer contained three times in long and fervent
praienge and his precious blood shedynge / In the which v. virtues he grant
us grace to follow him Jhu^s that blessed be ever pref^^^
without end /

AMEN
Thus ends the conte^placion for the thu*sdaye: and after follows the
passion: that longith specially to frydaye /
Of y^ passion of our lord Jhu^: and first of his prayer and taking at ma^yn
time / Cap^m xl.
AT the begin^ynge thou that desire to have sorouful compassion through
sentence inward affecco^n of the painful passion of Jhu^: thou must in thy
mind depart in manner for the time the might of the godhede fro the kyndly
Infirmyte of the manhede: though it so be in sothnes that the godhede was
never departed fro the manhede / For there ben many so blinded ghostly by
unreasonable ymagynaco^n of the might of the godhede in Jhu^: that they trow
not that any thing myight be paynfull or sorrowful to him: as to a another common
man: y^ has only the kind of man: and therefore have they none compassion of
y^ pains that he suffered. supposyng: that for as much as he was god. there
might no thing be against his will or dear him. but therefore heraye^st for to
have true ymagynaco^n and Inward compassion of y^ pains and the passion of
our lord Ihu^ very god and man / we shall understood. y^ as his will was to
suffer the hardeste death and sorrowful pains for redempco^n of ma^kinde: so
by the same will he suspendeth in all his passion the use and the might of the
godhede fro the Infyrmyte of the ma^hede no more taking of for the time. than
has a another tender and delicate man only after the kind of man / wherefore
you shall ymagyne and inwardly think on him in his passion as of a fair yo^ge
man of the age of xxxiii. year being y^ fairest the wysest the most rihhtwis
in living. and most goodly and innocent that ever was or might be in this
world. so falsely accused: so enuyously pursued. so wronfully demed. and so
dyspitously slain: as the process of his passion after tellith. and all for
thy love / Also understand as clerks sayen and reason techith that in his
bodily kind of man he was of the clen^est complexion that ever was man or
might be / wherefore he was y^ more tender in the bodi / and so folowith that
the pains in the body were the more sore and bitter and the harder to suffer
then^e sythen he took no socour of the godhede but only sufffred after kind
of the manhede / The leest pain that he had was more paynful to him: tha^ it
might have be to any other man / wherefore having this in mind first to styryng
of y^ more compassion / Ferdermore after the process of Bonauenture who so
desires with the apostle poul to be Joyeful in y^ cross of our lord Ihu^
christ. and in the blessed passion: he must with besy meditaco^n therein for the
great mysteries and all the process thereof if they were Inwardly co^sidred with
all the Inward mind and beholding of man^es soul. as I fully trow: they
should bring that beholder in to a new state of grace / For to him that would
search the passion of our lord with al his heart and all his Inward affection:
there should come many devout felynges and stirynges that he never supposed
before / Of the which he should feel a new co^passyon and a new love Have now
ghostly comfortes through the which he should perceive himself turned as it were
in to a new state of soul: in the which astate the foresaid ghostly felynges
should seem to him as a nernest and party of the bliss and Joye to come And for
to get this astate of the soul. I trow as he that is vncunnynge and
blaberynge: that it behooves to set thereto all the sharpness of mind with
waking eyes of heart: put tynge away and leuynge all other cures and besynes
for the ty^^^ and making himself as present in all that befell about y^
passion and crucifyxion affectuously. besily. auysedly. and perseuerantly: and
not passing lightly or with tedious heaviness. but with all the heart and ghostly
gladness* wherefore if thou that redest or herest this book. have here before
besily taken head to the things that haven be written and spoken of the blessid
^y^^ of our lord Ihu^ christ in to this time / Much more now y^ ^^^l te gader
all thy mind and all the strength of thy soul to tho things that folowen of
his blessed passion / For here specially is showed his hye charity: the which
resonably should all holy enflamme and brenne our hertes in his love / Goo we
pro(...) pa(...)
now then^e to the procrsse of his passion: taking head and making us in
mind as present to all that folowith / And first beholdinge how after the
process of the gospel of saint Johan our lord Ihu^s after that worthy supper
was done. and that noble and fructuous sermon ended. whereof it is spoken in the
next chapyter before. went with his discyples over y^ water of cedron. in to a
gardine: in to the which ^e was wo^ te often time to come with his discyples /
And there he badde hem abide and pray / And ferdermore taking with him his
three special secretoryes / That is to say. Peter. James. and Johan / And
telling hem that his heart was heavy and soroufull unto the death / Badde hem
there abide and wake with him in prayers / And so a lityll ferder fro hem as
about y^ space of a ^tone cast upon a lityll hylle / Mekely and reverently
knelynge upon his both knees made his prayer to the fader devoutly in manner as
it folowyth after / But here abide we a lityll while. and take we head with a
devout mind of this wonderful deed of our lord Ihu^. sothly worthy to be
had in mind in Inward sorrowful compassion / For loo now he prays to the
fader mekely: and that for himself. as we read that he has ott before prayed
/ But then^e for us as for our aduocat / wherefore we should skylfully be
stired to Inward co^passo^n and wonder here greatly of the lowest meekness:
and of the most perfyte obedyence and of unspeakable charytee of god showed to
us. And first of his profou^de meekness. considering him N. profu^ dissiam
bu^ilit^tem
that is very god: even with the fader almighty* and everlasting: so as it
were foryetynge himself as god: and so lowely prayenge as a another common man
of the people / Also take heed of his most perfect obedience / For what is he
that prays Sothly he prays the fader: if it be his will that he be not
llayn. ^^.
and put to that hard death: and yet with the fader he has or N* profu^
dissiam obedien ciam
dened to take that death for man / And so he prays the fader. and yet he is
not herd after his will: that is to say after one manner will that was in him
/ For there was in him three manner of will: that is to say / First the will
of the flesh. and the sensualyte: and that grutched and dradde: and would not
gladly N* triplice^ volu^te^ in xp^o
snffre death / Also the will of reason. and that was obeysaunt and assentyng:
as the prophet ysaye says of him / He was offered upon the cross to the
fader. for so was his will / And the third was y^ will of the godhede: the
which yaaf the sentence of his passion: and badde in all manner to be done /
wherefore Oblatus e^ qa ip^e voluit
in asmoche as he was very man: he dradde as man after the first will: and was
then in great anguysshe / And therefore Inwardly have compassion of him: in
asmoche as thou may with all thy heart / For loo the fader woll utterly that
he be slain and deed. and not wythsto^dynge that Proprio ^ilio suo no^peperc^t

alone / And after this prayer our lord Ihu^s tornynge again to his
discyples. woke hem. and comforted hem yet to pray / efte the second time.
and the third time turned again to his prayer in dyners places a little fro
other. as in the space of a stones cast: lightly without great strength: and
cotynued ye foresaid prayer to the fader. adding to and saying / Fader rightwis
if it so be: that thou have ordained and wilt in all manner that I suffer the
death upon the cross. thy will be fulfilled But I reco^mende to the fader my
sweet mother and my discyples: the which I have kept in to this time. all the

sorrow and compassion. that ought to styre the hardest heart that is in this

lord Ihu^s suffered in that time. and for our sake / For by the godhede he saw
ye hardest and sovereign pains that were to come in his body And therefore
after the manhede his tender body for fere and anguyssh brake out vyole^tly on
blood / Take heed also here that is specially to be noted. against our
Inpacyence / How our lord Jhesus prays three times: or he has ansuere fro
the fader* N. co^tra ^paci^ci am nost ^am
But then at the third time when our lord Ihus was in so great anguyssh of
spirit as it is said / Loo the prince of good angels Mychael stondynge by him.
comforted him and said / Heyle my lord Jhesu. your devout prayer and your
blody sweet I have offered and showed it to the fader in light of all the
blessed court / And we all falling down be^^^ him. haven besoughte him to
putt away ^ro you this bitter N. co^fo^ tac^em a^^^^
drink of your passion / But the fader ansuerde. and said. My dear loved sone
knows well: that the redempcyon o^ mankind: the which we desiren so of our
high charity may not be fulfilled and done so conuenyently and resonably.
without shedynge of his blood / wherefore if he woll the hele or souls it
behouyth him to deye for hem / And therefore my lord what deem ye now in this
matter / Our lord Jhesus ansuerde thene to the angel / I woll in all manner
the hele and the sauacyon o^ souls / And therefore I chese rather to suffer the
death: where through the souls that the fader has made unto his lyckenes may
be saved / Then I would not deye and the souls ben not again boughte /
wherefore my faders will be fultylled / And then^e said the angel to him. be
then^e now of good comfort my lord. and werchyth ma^fully / For it is semely
to him that is in high degree. to do great things and worthy. and to him that
is a manfull man to suffer hard things* For tho things that been hard and
paynfull shall soon pass. and thoo things that been Joyefull and glorious
shall come after. the fader says that he is and shall be ever with you: and
that he shall keep your dear mother and your discyples at your will / And shall
yield hem sauf again to you / And so the good meke lord took benygnely this
manner of comfort. and that of his creature. considering himself after the
kind of man less in worthiness than angels for the time of dedely life in
this world. and so he was soroufull as man / And so he was comforted of the
angels words as man: and so he took his leave of him: prayenge him to
reco^mende him to the fader: and all the court of heaven / And then^e this
third time he rose up fro his prayer all his body blody. whom thou may
behold with Inward compassion. how he wypeth his body / Or else perauenture
wasshith him pryuely in the river / And so gretely pyned in his body and that
is reverently to be had in soroufull compassion / For without great bytternesse
of sorrow this might not befalle to him / Nevertheless doctors and wise
clerks sayen that our lord Ihu^s prayed the fader in this manner: not only
for dread of his passion. but also for the great pite and mercy that he had of
his first people the Jews: sorowyng that they should be lost by occasion of his
death / For they should not have slain him: namly sithen he was of her kyn^e: and
was also contained written in her law as christ to come. And there with showed
hem so many great benefyces / wherfor^ he prayed the fader to this intent thus
/ My fader if it may be with the hele and the sauaco^n of Jews. that ye
multitude of other folk be turned to bileue: I forfake the passion and the
death / But if it be needful that the Jews be blinded in her malice. so that
other folk may have sight in true bileue. not my will: but thine be fulfilled
and done. that is to say after the first manner of will in him as it is said
before / After this he came to his disciples and said to hem / Now slepeth and
rests: for they had slept a lityl before there / Sothly he is a good herd
for he was full wakely and besy upon the keeping of that little flock his
byloued discyples / O true love: he loved hem in to the vtterest. that in so
great anguyssh and so bitter agonye was so besy to procure her hele and her
rest / Then^e saw our lord after his adversaries coming with torches and
arms: and yet he would not wake his discyples till they came nygh hem / And
then^e he said to hem. it suffyseth now. ye have slepte enough Loo he that
shall bitraye me is nyghe at hand / And therewith came that wicked judas the false tratour and worst marchaut before hem. and bodily kyssed that In^ocent
lamb his lord Ihu^s / For as it is written in the manner of custom that our
lord used of his great benygnyte. was. what time his discyples were sent forth.
at her coming again for to receyne he^ in lovely kiss / And therefore that
traitor went before. and kyssed him. as who says / I am not come with thise
armed me^ but in manner as here before I was wont. at mine again cominge and said
/ Heyle master / O very traitor. take now good head to our lord Ihu^: how
pacye^tly: and benyngly he receives that falls feyned clyppynge and traitors
kiss of that vnlely dyscyple: whose fete he wysshe a little before of his
sovereign me kenesse: and fed him with that high precious mete of his own
blessid body through his unspeakable charytee And also behold. how pacyently he
suffers himself to be taken. bounden and smyte^: and woodly lad forth as
though he were a theyf or a wicked dooer. and in all manner vnmyghty to help
him self / And also take heed: how he has in ward sorrow and co^pa^sion of
his disciples flee^ge fro him: and errynge / And also th^^ may see here great
sorrow of he^ how against her will br^^^ elte of man^es dread they gone fro him
making great ^^^^nynge: and with high sighynge as faderles chyldern not
^itynge what to do / And yet was her sorrow much more seeng her master and
lord so vilaynsly ferde with / And the hell bounds drawyng him as a be to
sacrefyce. and him as a meke la^be without resistance following / Now
ferdermore behold how he is ladde of thoos vylest wretches fro that river up
toward the cite of Ihrlm / And that hastily and with great py^ne. having his
hondes bounden behind him as a theyf g^^de above his cote. but not curyously /
And his mantel drawn fro him. and going bare head and stoupinge for the great
haast and traueylle tha^ they made him to have / And when be was brought
before the princes of prestes and the scrybes and the aldermen that were then
gadred abiding his coming glad were they then^e examynynge him and apposyng
sothly in many questions. and procuryng falls witness against him and spittyng
on his holy face. and hydynge his eyes. they buffeted him scornyng and saye^ge
/ Prophetise now and tell us who smote the last / And so in many manners they
vexed and tormented him. and he in all showed high pacyence / wherefore here we
owe to have Inward co^passo^n of all that he suffered so for us / At last the
great masters wenten her way: put tynge him in to a manner of prison there
under a lofte: and there they bounden him to a stonen pyler as men say that
have seen it / And also there they left with him some armed men to keep him for
more sykernesse. the which all that night vexed him in scornynges and shrewde
words. abredginge him and reprouynge in thise manner words as we resonably
may suppose / wenest thou to be better and wyser than our princes and masters
of the law / what un wit and folly was that in ye to reprehende hem. thou
sholdest not have been so hardy ones for to have opende thy mouth against hem:
but now shows thy lewd wit / For now thou stondeste as it besemyth to
such as thou art without doubt / Thou art worthy the death. and therefore
thou shall have it / And so al yt night now one and now a another by words and
deeds scorned him and reproved him / Take heed also on that other side of our
lord Jhu^s as shamfast pacyently in scylence holding his pees to all that
they putte^ upon him: casting down toward the earth his chere. as though he
were gylty and taken in blame: and here have we inwardly compassion / O lord
ihu^ in whose hondes art thou now comen: how much is thy pacyence / Sothly
this is the hour and the power of derkenesse / And so stood he bounden unto
that pyler unto the morrow / In the mean time John that had followed our lord
went to our lady and mawdleyne and other of her felawes that were that time
gadred in mawdleins ho us: where he had made the supper before. and told hem
all yt was befall of our lord and his discyples. and then^e was there
unspeakable soro we cryenge and weeping / Take now good intent to hem: and have
co^passo^n of hem. for they ben in y^ grettest disease and highest sorrow for
her lord / For they seen now well and fully trowen that he shall be deed / At
last our lady drew her by herself. and turned her in to prayer: and said /
Most worshipful fader* most piteous fader. and most mercyful fader I
reco^mende to you your own and mine derest loved sone Goo de fader be not to
him cruel sythen ye be to al other benygne Fader everlasting whether my dear
sone shall be deed / Sothly he did never evil / But rightwis fader yt ye woll
the redempco^n of mankind: I byseche you if it may be fulfilled by a another
manner: and that my sone be not deed if it be your will / For all thing is
possible to you. he helpith not himself: by cause of your obedyence and
reverence. but has in manner forsake himself: and made him as feeble and
vnmyghty among his enmyes / wherefore merciful fader help ye him and deliver
him me again fro her ho^des. and give him me again / By such manner words
prayed our lady for her son with all her might of soul and in great sorrow
/ And therefore have we pity of her. whom thou see in so great afflycco^n.

Of the bringing of our lord Jhesu before pylate at pryme / Caplm xl.


TThe friday erly on the morrow the princes and soueraynes of the people camen
again to the foresaid place where they had left our lord Jhesu. and maden his
ho^des to be bounden behind him and sayden thus to him / Come now with us come
theyf to thy dome. for this day thy wyckednes shall have an end. and now
shall be known thy wisdom / And so they ladde him forth to pylate the
Justice and he followed hem as an Innocent lamb / And when his mother and John
and other wymmen of her company that went out erly for to here and see of him:
metten with him at a cross way: and saw him with so great a multitude of
people lad as a theyf. and so foul and dispytously ferde with / with how great
sorrow they were then fulfilled. it might not be spoken / And so in that
metynge together of our lord Jhu^ and hem and syghte of other. there was great
sorrow on both parties / For our lord also had great soroufull compassion of
his mother and the other with her. and namely of his mother: that he knew in so
great sorrow for him as as though the soul should be departed fro the body /
wherfor^ in all thise we owen also to have great compassion / Then^e as it said
is: our lord was ladde to pylate. and they followed aferre. for they might not
come nyghe for the people / He was there accused of many things. the which
they might not prove / And therefore pilate send him to herod as the gospel
of luke tellyth / And for asmoche as herod might neither have word of him nor
miracle done as he desired. he held him but a fool / wherfor^ as in scorn. he
let clothe him in white: and so sent him again to pylate / And so you may see
that our lord not only was holde^ N
as a theyf and a wicked dooer: but also as a fool / Thus as saint N
gregory says done holy doctors and prechers following our lord Jhu^: when
they seen the herers only desire and look after curio syte and profyten not in
a mendement of evil living. they chosen rather in scylence to be holden as
foles: than to show hemself in prechyng without fruit of souls / Behold now
ferdermore the great pacyence of our lord in all that is done to him / For
they leden him through the cite toward and froward as a fool hangyng down his
head in shamfast manner: and pacyently herynge reproues. scornynges. cryenges:
and suffrynge many dispytes: as perauenture in casting of stones at him or of
fylthe and uncleanness upon him / And also behold his mother and his other
fre^des with unspeakable sorrow on fe^ after following / when he was then^e
brought again to pylate: and the cursed hou^des besily and styfly stoden in
her falls accusaco^ns / Pylate knowing her envy would have delyuerde him and
said / I find no cause of death in this man: wherefore I shall vndernyme him
and chastyse him. and so leave him amended / O pylate pylate wolt thou
reprehende and chastyse thy lord god: thou wost not what thou do / For he
never deserved betynge or death / But thou sholdest do better and more
rightwisly if thou would chastise and amend thilself at his will And
then^e at the biddynge of pylate that he should be scorged and beten: our lord
was dispoyled: bounden to a pyler. and hard and sore scorged / And so stant
he naked before hem all that fairest yo^ge man of all chyldern. that ever were
borne. taking pacyently of all tho foulest wretchest the hardest and most
strokes of scorges / And so is that most Innocent fairest. and clennest
flesh flower of all mankind and full of wou^des. rennynge, out of all
sides that precious kings blood / And so long be ten and scorged with wound
upon wound. and brisour upon brysour: till both the lokers and the smyters
were weary / And then^e was he beden to be vnbou^den / Sothly the pyler that he
was bosiden to: yet shewith the steps of his blood. as it is contained in
stories Take now good here by inward meditaco^n of all his pains abidyngly.
and but thoufynde thyn heart melt in to sorrowful compassion. suppose fully and
hold that thou have to hard a stonen heart / Then^e was fulfilled in deed
that Vidimus eu^ and no^ e rat ei aspectus
the prophet ysaye said of him long time before We seen him in that time: and
there was none semelines: nor beauty in him. and we held him as foul as a
leprose man that were smyten down. and made low of god / wherefore we set
no reward to him / O lord Jhesn who was he so fool hardy that durst
dispoylle the / But who were they much worse hardy that durst bind the / But
who were they alther worste and most fool hardy: that durst so bytterly beat
the and scorge the / But sothly thou sone of ryghtwysnes at that time
wythdrewest thy beams of light: and therefore al was in derkenesse: and in the
night of wyckidnesse / For now all thyn enmyes ben more mighty than thou. and
that made thy love and our malice / Cursed be that malice and wyckydnes of
sin. wherefore thou were so tormented / After he was vnbounden fro that
pyler. they ladden him so beten and naked about the house sekyng after his
clothes that were cast in diverse places of hem that dispoyled him / Here have
co^passyon of him in so great cold quakynge and tre^blynge For as the gospel
wytnessith / It was then hard cold / And when he would have done on his
clothes: some of the most wicked with stoden and camen to pylate. and sayden /
Lord he this made him self king: wherefore let us clothe him and crown him.
as a king / And then^e they token an old sylken mantell of read and casten on
him. and maden a garlonde of sharp thorns and thyrste^ it on his head: and
putten in his ho^de a read for a ceptre. and al he pacyently suffers / And
after wha^ they kneled and salued him in scorn saying / Heyle king of Jews:
he held his pees and spoke not / Now behold him with sorrow of heart namly
wha^ they smyten him grievously and often times upon the head full of sharp
thorns. the which perced grievously in to the brain pan^e. and made it all
full of blood / And so they scorned him. as if he would have reigned. but yt he
might not. and al he suffers as her sernau^te or knave / O wretches how
dredful shall yt head appear at the last to you. the which ye smyten now so
boldli / And yet this suffiseth not to her malice: but to mo^ reprove and
scorn of he^m. they gadred al her wicked company first to wonder upon him in
the house. and after they brought him out before pylate. and all the people in
that manner Illuded with ye crown of thorns and yt old purpur vestyment / See
now for goddis love how he stant in that manner ha^ging his face dou ne toward
the earth before all the great multitude cryenge and asking of pylate /
Crucifye: crucyfie him. and scorning him that he would make him wyser than the
princes and the pharysees and the doctors of the law / And how his wysdom was
torneth in so great folly as it showed in that time / And so not only he
suffered great pains and sorrow in his body within for the: but also many and
foul abredgynges and reproues without forth /

How our lord Jhu^s was dampened to the death of the y^ cross about tyerce of
the day / Caplm xlii.
AFter that our lord Jhu^s was long time so tormented and Illuded as it is
said. and the princes of the Jews with great Instaunce contynuelly askeden and
maden all ye multitude with hem to cry and ask that he should be crucyfyed At
last the wretched Justyce pylate dredynge more to offend hem: than to
condemn the Innocent wrongefully. yaaf the sentence upon him at her will. and
so dampened him to be hanged on the cross / And then^e were the princes and
pharysees and the aldermen Joyefull and glad. that they had her intent
fulfilled / They have not in mind the great benefyces and wonderful deeds
that he has showed hem / And also they be^ not moved to pite for his
Innocence: and that is more cruel in hem They ben not slaked nor withdrawn fro
her malice. by the great despytes and pains that they have seen and done to
him before / But laughen and maken Joye and scornen him that is very god: and
may dampne hem to everlasting death / And so they now besien hem in all that
they may to bring him hastily to his death / wherefore he is ladde in again to
the house where he was before scorged: and Illuded. and there was draw fro him
that old purpyll mantell. and so he all naked was beden to clothe himself
again / Now with Inward co^passo^n behold him here in manner as I said before
oonly after the manhede so passing so fair a young man most Innocent and
most lovely in that manner all to rent and wounded: and all blody naked with a
manner of shamefastnes gadryng his clothes in diverse places of that house as
they were dysclatered by thoo harlottes doing hem on in honest manner before
hem that ever lowghen him to scorn. as though he were the Nota de pacie^c^a

most wretch of al other forsaken of god. and without al manner socoure or
help / wherefore now take heed dyligently to him and have wounder of that
great profounde mekenes of him / and in as much as thou may conform the to
follow him by pacyence and mekenes / and suffrynge of wrong for his love / And
gooth forth with him. and behold how After he has done on his clothes / they
ladden him forth in great haste and layne upon him y^ worshipful tree of the
cross that was heavy and full long: that is to say as it is written in stories
/ xv / foot of length ye which he as a meke and most pacient lamb took
upon his sholders and bears forth And so was he ladde forth with his two
felawes that were thieves and dampened to the self death. and this is his
felawship at this time. O good lord Jhu^: what shame done they to you: yt
should be your friends / they maken you felawe to thieves. and yet they done
worse / for they maken you to bear your cross that is not read of hem /
wherefore not oonly as the prophet ysaye says / ye be put with wicked doers
and thieves. but also with Cu^ ini^s deputatus est
worse than thieves / Sothely lord thy patience may not be spoken / Ferthermore
as to the process seenge his dear mother that she might not follow him nyghe
for the great multitude of people about him: she took another way more short
in haste with Johan and other of her felawship / so yt she myte mete with him
before other by that way / and when she met with him without the yate of
the Cite. there as ii. ways metten to gyder: and saw him charged and ouerlayd
with so great a tree of ye cross / ye which she saw not before. she was all
out of herself. and half deed for sorrow: so that neither she might speak to
him one word. nor he to her by cause of great haast of hem that ladden him to
the Jews / And a lityl after our lord turned him to the wym^en that followed
him Filie iherlm nolite sle^ super me
weeping and said to hem / ye daughters of Jhrlm wepith not on me: but on
yourself. and so forth after the gospel / And in thise ii. places were after
made chirches in mind of thise thiges as they sayen that have seen hem
Ferthermore by cause of the mount of caluarie where he was crucyfied: was a
great space fro the yate of the cite. and he was atter so over come with
traueyle and weary. that he might no longer bear y^ heavy cross. he laid it
down / But the cursed tormentours: and they full of malice dredynge for to
dyfferre his death. leest that pylate would have called again his sentence and
dome / For he showed before a will to have delyuerde him. they maden a another
man that was called simon to bear the cross with him: and ladden him so
discharged of the cross. but bounden his bonds behind him as a theif to that
place of his Jewesse y^ mount of caluarye / Now if you take good head to all
that has be done to our lord Jhu^. and all yt he suffered at matyn time: and
pryme and tyerce in to this time. shall it not be seen to the as matere of
great compassion of his great passion and sorrow: sothly I B
trow yes: and namly if thou wolt now make in thy mind a recapitulaco^n: and
reherce in general that he has suffered: and y^ has be done to him in to this

Other making ready and setting up ladders: and or deynynge other Instruments
that hem thought nedfull. and other fast about to spoil him. and draw of his

syghte of all that people / And so ben now the third time re: nued the
brysours of the wou^des in his scorgrnge by the cleuynge of his clothes to his
flesh / Now also first his mother sees how he is taken and ordained to the
death / wherefore she sorouful out of mesure. and having shame to see him so
sto^dynge all naked / For they left him not somoche as his pryue clothes: she
went in haste to her dear sone and clypped him and gyr de him about the lendes
with the kircheif of her head / O lord in what sorrow is her soul now* when
she sees such despites done to her sone. sothly I trow that she might not
speak one word to him for sorrow / But she might do nomor^ to him: nor help
him: for if she might without doubt she would / then^e was her sone anon taken
out of her hands in a wood manner: and ladde to the foot of the cross / Now
take heed dilygently to the manner of crucifyeng. there ben set up ii. ladders.
one behind and another before at the last term of the cross: the which ii.
wicked minysters gone up with nails and hamers / Also another short ladder is
set before the cross: y^ la steth up to the place where his fete should be^
nailed / Now take good head to all that folowyth / Our lord then^e was co^pel
led and beden for to goo upon that ladder to the cross: and he me kely does
all that they beden him / And when he came to the ouerest end of that short
ladder: he turned his back to y^ cross and stretched out on broad the ii.
kings arms and his fairest hands yaaf to hem that crucified him / And then
lyftynge up his eyes to heaven said to the fader in thise manner words / Lo Nota
verba filii ad pre^m
here I am my dear fader as thou would that I should loowe myself unto the
cross for the sauaco^n of mankind. and that is pleysynge and acceptable to
me: and for hem I offer myself the which thou would should be my brethren
/ wherefore also thou fader take gladly this sacrifyce for hem of me. and now
hens forward be pleysed and well wylled to hem for my love: and all old
offense and trespace foryeue: and wype awaw and put aferre all vnclen^es of
syn^e fro hem / For sothly I offer here now myself for them: and their hele /
And then he that was on the ladder behind the Cross: takyth his right
hand: and was on y^ ladder behind the cross. takes his right hand / and
nayleth it fast to the cross. And after he that was on the lift side draws
whyth all his might the lyttt arm / and hand and dryueth there thru another
great nail. After they comen down and taken aweye all the ladders / and so
hangs our lord oonely by tho two nails smyten through his hondes without
sustenaunce of the body drawing dounwarde peynfully thorugh the weight thereof.
Here with also another harlot renneth to and draws down his fete with all
his might: and another anon dryueth a great long nail thorugh both his
fete Joined to other / this is one manner of his crucifyenge after the oppynyon
of som^e men: Other there ben that trowen that he was not crucyfyed in this
manner / but first lyggynge the cross on the ground they nailed him thereupon
and after with him so hangyng they lyften up the cross: and festen it down in
the earth / And if it was done in this manner: then may thou see hou
vylaynsly they taken him as a rybaulde. and casten him down upon the cross*
and then^e as wode thieves drewen on both sydees / first his hondes / and after
his fete. and so nailed him fast to the cross: And after with all her might
lyften up y^ cross with him hangyng as high as they might / And then^e let
it fall dooune in to the moiteyse: In the which fall as thou may
understand all the senowes to breken to his sovereign pain. But whether so
hit be in one manner or in other: sothe it is that our lord Jhu^s was nailed BN
hard upon the cross hand and foot / and so streyned and drawn: that as he
him self says by the prophet Dauyd that Dinu^e taueru^t ossa mea
they might tell and nombre all his bones: then^e rennen out of his blessed
body the stremes of that holiest blood on all sides habondauntly fro the great
wounds / and so he is con streyned and arted. that he may not meue but his
head. wherefore hanging the body only by tho three nails. no doubt But that
he suffers so bitter sorrow and pains that there may no heart think. ne
tongue tell / And yet more over he hanged between two thieves. of the which
that one blasphe myed and tempted him to Jnpacye^ce. and therewith other blasphe
myng and scornynge sayen Vath this is he y^ destroys the temple of god and
makith it up again in iii. days / And other sayde^ He made sauf other. but he
may not now save himself: and many other reproues and scornynges they sayden
to him. as the gospel tellyth / And all thise reproues: blasphemies and
despites ben done seenge and herynge his most soroufull mother: whose Notabn^
compassion and sorrow made him her sone to have the more bitter pain / And on
that other half she henge in soul with her sone on the cross: and desired
Inwardly rather to have deyed that time with him: than to have lived longer /
And so stood the mother beside the cross of her sone. between his cross and
the cross of the theif. she turned never her eyes fro him / She was full of
anguyssh as he was also / And she prayed to the fader at that time with all her
heart: saying thus / Fader and N^ o^o ne^ m^^s pro filio
god without end it was pleysyng to you that my sone shol de be crucified. and
it is done. yet is not now time to ask him of you again: but ye see now in what
anguyssh is his soul / I beseech you. that ye woll ease his pains / Good
fader I^recommende to you in all that I may my dear sone. and also he her sone
prayed for her pryuely in himself saying / My fader ye N^ o^o ne^ filii. pro

she / But loo now she hangs on the cross with me / Mine own crucifyenge
suffyseth. for I bear the sins of all the people / She has not deserved any
such thing wherfor^ I reco^mende her to you: that ye make her pains less /
Then^e was with our lady John and mawdleyn the biloued discyples: and other of
his freudes by the cross of our lord Jhu^ the which all maden great sorrow
and wepten* and myghte^ not be comforted in no manner of her byloued master.

word that our lord spoke that yaaf so much boldenes to his enemies: and so
much occasion to his friends for to despair / that he was god / as that word

also was occasion to his mother. and Johan and other friends of great

it so be. that it may be understand that word of Sicio or thyrst ghoostly to
that intent that he thyrsted then^e ye hele of souls. Nevertheless also in

WHat time that this worshipful mother of our lord Jhesu Ca. xlv B N
as it is said next before abode and dwelled beside ye Cross with other true
lovers of him before named beholdynge our lord Jhesu contynuelly so pytously
hanging deed on the cross between two thieves. Lo then^e come many armed men
out of the cite toward hem: the which were sent to break the legs of hem
that were crucyfyed. and so to slay hem all out and burye hem / by cause that
her bodies should not abide hanging on the cross / in the sabotte day. then^e
rose up our lady and all other with her. and besyly looked and saw hem come
but what to do they wot not. wherefore they fallen in to great sorrow and dread
/ and namely our lady speaking to her sone in this manner: My dear sone what
may be cause that al these armed men comen agayene / what will they do more to
the. Have they not slain the my dear sone / I had hoped that they had been
filled with that they have done to the: But as it seems to me. yet they
pursuen the deed. And I wot not what I may do. For I may help the no more:
than I might deliver the fro the death. But I shall abide and see: and pray
thy fader that he make hem soft and easy to the / and there with they all five
yeden and stoden before the cross of our lord Then^e come the foresaid armed
men to hem with great wodenes and noise and seenge the thieves yet living with
great Ire they hewn and breken despytously her legs / and so slewe^ hem. and
caste^ hem anon in to some diche there beside / And after turned hem again:
and camen toward our lord Jhu^ wherefore our lady dredynge leest they would
do in the same manner to her sone. and there through smyten with sorrow of heart
within forth. she cowde naught else: but goo to her best armure: that is to
say her kyndly meekness: and knelyng down before hem. and spredyng her
ho^des with an high voys and weeping chere. she spoke to hem in this manner /
Good bredern I beseech you for almighty goddis love that ye torment me no more
in my dear sone / For sothly I am his most sorouful mother / And as ye know well
brethern. I never offended you nor did any wrong to you / But though it so
be that my sone seemed contraryous to you. ye have slain him And I foryeue you
all wrong and offense: ye and the death of my sone wherefore does me now that
mercy: that ye break him not as ye have done the thieves: so that I may berye
his body all hole. for it nedith not. sythen as ye seen he is fully deed: and
was a long time now passed / And therwyth John and magdalene and her other
systers knelynge with our lady besoughten the same with her sore weeping / O
lady what do ye. ye lowen you to the fete of hem that been most wicked / And
prayen hem that have no reward to any good prayer / Suppose ye to bow by
your pity hem that been most cruel. and most wicked and without pity / Or to
overcome hem that been alder proudest with mekenes: nay / For proud men have
abhomynaco^n of mekenes. ye traueyllen in vain / And therwyth one that was
named longius: and was that time wicked and proud: but after a true liver and
marter: despisyng her weeping and prayers. with a sharp spear opened the side
of our lord Jhesu. and made a great wound / Out of the which anon ran^e
together both blood and water / And therwyth our lady fell down in a
swounyug half deed between the harms of magdalene And that John not mowynge
bear that great sorrow took to him man^es heart: and risyng against hem: said / ye
wicked me^ why do ye this cruelte / See ye not that he is deed? why woll ye
also slaye this woman his mother / Go now your way for we shall berye him / And
therwyth as god would. they went her way / Then^e was our lady excyted. and
so rose as it had be fro sleep. asking what was done more to her sone. and
they said none new thing more against him / And after she had caughte spirit
and beheld her sone so grievously wounded was also wounded in her heart with a
new wound of sorrow See thou now how often times our lady is this day deed /
sothly as often as she saw done against her sone oni pain / wherefore now is
fulfilled in her that symeon said to her prophecyeng T^a^ ipsius a^am
ptra^sibit glad^us
long before: his suerde shall perce through thyn oune soul: that is to say.
the suerde of his passo^n. and sorrow / And that befelle often times in this day
/ But now sothly the suerde of this spear has perced both the body of the
sone. and the soul of the mother / After this they saten down all beside the
cross / but what they shall do. they wot not / For they may not take do un
the body. and berye it: by cause they have neither stre^gthe nor Instruments
apt therefore / And for to goo away fro him so hanging they dare not. and
long abide there they may not* by cause that the night was come on hem / Here
may thou see in what sorrow and perplexyte they ben / O benygne lord Jhesu
how is this that ye suffer your dear mother chosen before all other: that is the
myrrour of the world. and your special resting place. so to be tormented
and troubled. that uneath she has any spirit to live / And time it were that
she had some manner of rest. and relecynge of her sorrow /

IN the mean time that our lady and Johan / and other before said were in so
great perplexyte and desolacion as it is said / they lokeden toward the cite as
oftymes dyden for dread / and then see they many other coming toward hem by
the way the which was Joseph of armathre and Nycodeme bringing with hem
diverse Instruments / with the which they should take down the body of Jhu^
fro the cross: And also they brought an hundred pound of myrre and aloes for
to anoynte his body and so burye hit And then^e they all risen up with great
dread: not knowing what they would do: O lord god: how great is thy sorrow this
day Then^e Johan taking head to hem that were so coming said to our lady.
Sothely I see coming there Joseph and Nichodeme. And then^e our lady caughte
spirit / and was gretely comforted and said: Blessed be our lord god / that
has sent us help at our need: and has mind of our sorrow. and that has
not forsake us in our trybulacyon. Good sone Johan goo against hem: and
welcome hem. For I wot well. they come to our socoure: And anon Johan went
against hem: And when they metten. they clipped other with weeping teres and
might not speak to other a great while for tenderness of co^passyon and sorrow
/ After that they had walked forth a little while and drawn nyghe toward
the Cross / Joseph asked who were there with our lady. and how it stood with
ye other dyscyples: and Johan answering told hem. whoo were there with our
lady. but of the discyples he could not tell: for he said: there was none of
hem seen of all y^ day* and ferthermore at her asking: he told all that was
done against our lord and all the process of his passion. and when they come
nygh the place knelynge down and weeping they honored our lord Jhesu / And
after metynge together our Lady and her systers and mawdleyne received hem
worshipfully with knelyng and low bowynge to therthe: and they again ward
knelynge and worship pynge with great weeping stoden so together a great while
or they speken / But at last our lady began to speak to hem and said / Sothly
friends ye hane done well: that ye have mind so of your master: for he loved
you well / And as I knowledge plainly to you it semyd to me. that there was a
new light risen at your coming / For before we wyste not what we myighte do:
and therefore god quyte you / And they sayden aye^warde we ben sorry with all our
heart for all these wrongs and malice done against him / For as we seen well
the wicked men haven the maystry against the ryghtwysman. and we would full
gladly have delyuerde him fro so great Jniury if we had might* But at the
leest we shall do this service to our lord and master that we ben come fore /
And then^e they made hem ready to take him down / Take now good head in manner
as I have said before to the manner of taking down. there are set ii. laders
on the sides on the cross. one against another: and Joseph gooth upon the
ladder sto^dynge of yt houde on the right half and besteth him to draw out
the nail of yt hand: but it is full hard / For the nail is great and long:
and hard driven in to ye tree And without great thirstyng down of our lords
ho^de it may not be done: but that is no force: for our lord knowyth that he
doyth al truly and with good intent. and therefore he acceptith his deed / And
when the nail was drawn out: john makith sign to nychode for to take him it
privily. so that our lady see it not for dyscomfortynge / And after in the
same manner nychodeme drawyth out the nail of the lift hand. and takyth it
pryuely to Johan / And then nychodeme comyth down for to draw out the third
nail of the fete / And in the mean time Joseph susteyneth the body / Soothly
well is him that may sustain and clyppe that holiest body of our lord Jhesu:
therwyth our lady takyth in her hondes reverently our lords right ho^de and
beholds it. and lays it to her eyes: and devoutly kissith it sore weeping
and sighinge / And wha^ the nail of the fete was drawn out / Joseph came of
softly. and al layden to hand. and token our lords body: and laid it down
upon therthe: and our lady took ye head and the sholders: and laid it in her
arm / But mawdaleyn was ready to take and kiss the fete: at ye which she
found somoche grace before in his life / Other of that company stoden about
beholding. and al making great lamentaco^n upon him after the prophecye yt was
then^e fulfilled: saying yt they should make sorrow upon him as upon the one
begeten child. and namly his blessed mother al times sore weeping / And then^
soroufuly beholdynge the wou^des of hondes and fete. and specially ye horrible
wound of his side: now taking head to one: and now to another / And see^ge
his head so foul ferde with. and his bear to drawn with ye sharp thorns:
and his lovely face all defouled with spittynges and blood: and the here is of
his berde drawn away fro his chekes. as the prophet ysaye spekyth in his

AFter a lityll while lyenge the body of our lord Jhesu between his moders
arms as it is said / when it drew toward night: Joseph prayed our lady
that she would suffer the body to be dressed after the manner of Jews and
beryed / But she was looth thereto: and said / Good bredern take not so soon
my child fro me. rather berieth me with him / Then^e said John / My dear mother
let us assent to Joseph and Nychomede: and suffer our lords body to be
beryed / For else by occasyon of tomoche taryenge ye might fall lightly in
dangeour and sclau^der of ye Jews / And at this suggestyon of John our lady
as wise and discrete. thinking yt she was committed to him by our lord would
no longer let his beryenge* but blessed the body: and let hem dress it as
they would / And John nichodeme Joseph and other began to enoynt the body. and
wrappe it in lynnen clothe as it was the manner of Jews beryenge / Neth eles
our lady kept always the head in her lap: for to dress that herself. and
mawdleyne the fete / And wha^ they had dressed the legs and camen nygh to ye
fete / Mawdleyne said: I pray you suffer me to dress the fete. at the which
I fond somoche grace. and they suffryng her askyng: she held the fete and
looked upon hem: weping and almost failing for sorrow / And right as she before
in his life wyssh he^ with teres of co^puncco^n. now much more she wasshyth he^
with teeres of great sorrow. and Inward compassion / For as he very
sothfastnesse witnessith of her. she much loved. and therefore she wept much:
and namly in this last service doing to her master and lord so deed
piteously. uneaths for sorrow myight her heart abide in her body. for she would
full gladly have deyed there at her lords fete / She saw never other remedy
but she besieth her with al her might now at ye last service to him. ye which
was full uncouth to her for to dress his body in the best manner yt she may. but
not as she would. for she has neither matere whereof nor time thereto / But
netheles in manner as she may she wasshith his fete with teres: and after
devoutly wypeth hem and kysseth hem. and wrappeth in clothes in the best manner
as she can / when they have this done and dressed the body in to the head. they
loken to our lady yt she would perform her part / And then^e began they al
mekely to weep and make sorrow / Then she seenge that she may no longer
differ^. sett^th her sight upon ye face of her sone: and spekith to him in this

painful and dear is this bienge / wherefore nevertheless I am glad for the hele

for I wot well that thou dydest never syn^e. and that thou art slain without

she wysshe much better his head: than magdalayne did before his fete* Then^e
she wyped his face. and kyssed it: and after wound his head in a sudary: and
so signed and blessed him / And then all together honoring and kissing his
fete token him up. and beren him to the grave / Our lady berynge the head: and
magdalayne the fete. and other the mydyl part / There was nyghe y^ place of the

him her blessing. they layden a great stone at door of ye grave: and went her
way toward the cite. that is to say Joseph and his felyshyp / But Joseph at
his gooynge spoke to our lady and said / My lady I pray you for goddis love
and for ye love of your sone our master: that ye vouchesauf to come and take

ERly at the morough upon the saturday stoden in the for said house ye yates

sorrow: having in mind the great trybulacions and anguysshes of the day
before not speaking: but by times lokynge on other in manner: as they done that been ouerlayed with great myscheyf and sorrow. and known none comfort. ne none
socoure / And therwyth they herd one knock at the yate / And then^e they
dreden sore For all thing in that time they dradden: by cause that her
sykernesse and comfort was away / Nevertheless John went to the door* and
understanding that it was peter. told hem so / And our lady badde undo the
door. and let him in And peter ^^mynge (...) with great shame weeping and
sobbing saluted our lady* and other: but naught spoke / And therwyth they all
began to weep. and might not speak for sorrow / A little while after camen
other disciples one after a another in the self manner at y^ beginning. making
sorrow and weeping / But at y^ last wha^ they seaceden of weeping: and began to
speak of her lord* peter first said in this wise / I am ashamed and confounded
(...) myself: and I should not by reason speak in your presence. or appear in
the syghte of men / For asmoche as I left so cowardly and forsook so untruly
my lord that loved me somoche And in the same manner all other smitynge her
hondes and sore weeping accused and reprehended hemself: that they had so
left her lord / Then our lady comfortynge hem said* Our good lord
master* and our true herdman is goon fro us. and we ben left now as faderles
chyldern / But I hope truly y^ we shall soon hane him again / And ye know
well that my sone is benygne: and mercyful. blessed may he be / For he loved
you well: and therefore doubts not. but that he shall be well re^oucylied to
you: and gladly he shall foryeue all the trespasses and all offenses / For
sothly by suffrau^ce of the fader the malice against him was so great. and the
woodnes of his enmyes so strong and mighty that ye might not have socoured him
though ye had abide still with him: and therefore dredeth not all shall be well
/ Then^e ansuerde peter and said: sothly as ye say. so it is / For I that
saw but a lityll of the beginning was with so great dread smyten in the
porche of Cayphas house. that uneath wend I for to have escaped the death / And
therefore I forsook him. and had no mind at that time of the words that he
had said to me before till he looked on me And mawdleyne asked what those words
were: and he said how he told him before that he should forsake him. and what
time / And so forth he told all his words spoken to hem. and specially y^ he
told before many things to hem of his passion in that supper time. that he
made with he^ the thursday at even / Then^e our lady said that she would gladly
here of that process that befell at that supper / And Peter made sign to John
that he should tell that process. and John tells all that was done: and said
/ And after to peter he told all the process of his passion as he desired /
And so what of thise things and of other done by our lord Jhu^ among hem
they tellen to other. now one and now another as it comyth to her mind /
During away all that day in such manner talkynges of our lord Jhu^ / O lord
how attentifly and besely mawdleine listened to those words: but much more our
lady: saienge often times at the end of a process / Blessed be my sone Jhesus:
namely when she and mawdleyne herd of the making of the sacrament / And how
he yaaf hem in ye form of bread his own body to ete: and in the form of wine
his blood to drink Sothly I trow yt with souerayn merueyle her hertes melted
in to likynge sorrow. and soroufull likynge brekyng out on weeping. and
shedynge sweet teres for that hye brennyng love that he showed to man
soueraynly in that excellent and passige deed of charity / But now passing over
so shortly of this ineditaco^n at this time / Morouer take heed: and behold
hem this day in great sorrow and dread. and have compassion of he^ if thou
can For what is it to see how that the lady of all the world. and the
pryncesse of holy church and chyuetayns of goddis people. ben now so in dread
and sorrow: stoken and hid in y^ lityll house. not knowinge what they may
do. not having comfort but oonly in that coming of the words and deeds of
her lord Jhu^ / Nevertheless our lady stood always sadly in a restfull and
peasyble heart / For she had ever a certain hope of the resurrecco^n of her
sone / And therfo^ holy church makyth mind special of her every saterdaye:
by that in that dare stood only in her ye faith of our lord Jhu^ that he was
very god Nevertheless she might not have fully Joye: by cause of the mind of
his hard death and his bitter passion / when the son^e was gone down: and it
was leifful to werche: mary mawdleyne and another mary with her yeden forth in
to the cite: for to bye matters able for to make oynements of: as they had so^
what done on the fridaye before in to the son^e settelyng For by the law they
were bound to keep the sabbot day fro y^ son^e rest of the day before in to
the son rest of the same day Now take heed and behold hem how they goon
with soroufull chere in manner of desolate wydoues to some apothecha*ry or
spycer. the which they had knowledge of that he was a good devout man: and
that would gladly fulfylle her will and desire in that party / And when they
have chosen the best oynements that they cowde find. and paid therfo^: they
yeden home again: werchynge hem in the best manner yt they cowde / And so
may thou see. how diligently and truly they werchen and traueyle for her
lord with wepynges and sighynges a monge / And how our lady and thapastles
stoden and behelden and peraueuture helpen among / And when it was night they
seaceden and yeden to rest such as was / And so this may be the meditaco^n
for the saterdaye touching our lady and other wymmen and the apoostles /



But what did our lord Jhu^s that day / Soothly anon as he was deed He went
in soul down in to hell. there as holy faders weren / And then weren they
in Joye and bliss by virtue of his blessed presence / For the syghte of god*
is perfyte Joye / And here may we see. how great is his benygnytee. in that he
would himself goo down to hell How great charity and meekness that was / For
he might have send an angel and hane delyuerde hem out of the deuylles
bonds: and brought hem to him where he had list. but his love and his
mekenes would not have suffered that: and therefore he went himself down in to
hell. and vysited his chosen souls there: and that not as servants but
fre^des of him yt was lord of all / And then^e all the holy faders in his
coming filled with Joye and bliss: and al sorrow and myslikyng away passed
stoden before him in louynges and songs of prophecyes: and psalms that were
beforsaid / And then^e fulfilled as they ben written in holy wrytt in to the
time that he would take his body again. and rise up gloriously fro death to life:
as it folouyth in process herafter / To ye which lif for to rise at ye last

AS I said before Mary Mawdleyne and her two fellows token her way toward the
grave of our lord Jhesu with precious oynements / And wha^ they came without

of her dear master / And therfo^ in all places where any thing was notably
done against him or by him: they somewhat stoden. and abiding knelynge down

down the cross / And here it was that the wicked tormentours violently and
cruelly putten him fourth. and constrayneden him to goo faster / And here at
the last they spoylleden him of his clothes and maden him all naked: and so
cruelly nayleden him upon the cross / And then^ with great sorrow and shedynge
of teres falling down upon her faces they worshippeden inwardly and kisseden
devoutly the cross of our lord that was then^e spreyned with his precious
read blood / And ferdermore they rysynge up. and goinge Tettus

saying to hem / Dredeth not / ye sechyth Jhesu / And so forth as the gospel

as they hopeden were so dystour*bled in her wits and abashed that they
token no^ reward to the angels words / But with great sorrow and dread anon
turned again to the discyples / And told them that her lords body was

and saying to hem / what seek ye him yt lives with hem that been deed / But
they yet token no reward to her words. nor token any comfort to the sight of
the angels: for they soughten not the angels. but the lord of angels / And for
they fond him not: therefore the ii. felawes of mawdlayne al heavy and

hoped Tertus maria st abat ad monumentu^ Notabil

the wonderful werchynge of love / A little before she herd of one angel that
he was risen: and after of ii. that he lived / And yet she had it not iu mind.
but said: I wot not. and all that made love / For as orygene says: her heart
and her mind was not the^ she was in body: but it was there as her love was:
that is to say her master Jhu^s: and therefore she could not speak nor here
but of him / And therefore befell that what time she wept so and took none

was lord of angels her mercyful master might no leuger hold him fro her:

How our lord Jhu^s apered after his resurrecco^n to mawdelayne / Caplm lii.
OVre lord Jhu^s speaking with his blessed mother at his first apperynge to
her* as it was told and said before Among other lovely comynynge told her of
the great besynes and fervent feeling of mawdleyne. and said that he would goo
show him bodily to her to comfort her / And our lady glad thereof said / My
blessed sone gooth in pees and comfort her / For she louyth you full much.
and full truly: and was full sorry of your death / But I pray you. thinks to
come again to comfort me / And so she lovely clyppyng and kissynge him. let
him goo / And anon he was in the gardyne where mawdleyne was. and said to her
/ woman who^ sechest thou? And why wepest thou / Our lord asked that he wyste
well / To that end as saint gregory says that by her ansuere in the namyng of
him the fire of love should be more fervently kyndled in her heart /
Nevertheless she not knoweynge him. but all dystracte and out of herself.
supposing that he had be a gardy^er said / Sire if thou have take him away
tell me where thou haste done him. that I may take him to me / And though our
lord was not a bodily gardyner. nevertheless as the same clerk gregory says.
he was so in soth to her ghostly / For he was that planted in her heart the
plants of virtues and true loves / And then^e our lord Jhu^s having
compassyon of her great sorrow and weeping chere called her by her homely name.
and said mary. the which word suddenly heled all her sorrow / And she then^e
knowing him with unspeakable Joye said / O Rabony: that is master. ye be he y^
I have so long sought? and why have ye hid you so long from me / And
anon she ran to him: and falling down to the earth: would have kyssed his
fete as she was wont before by imperfect affecco^n to his manhede that was
then^e dedely: but not so now after his Resurrecco^n / wherefore our lord
willing to lift up ghostly her heart and her affection to heaven and to the
godhede* and yt she should no more seek him in earth in manner as she did
before that he was deed. said / Touch me not in that erthli manner. for I have
not stied up to my fader / That is to say: I am not yet lift up in thy soul
by true and perfyte believe. that I am even with the fader very god / And
therefore touch me not in that manner Inperfytely But goo and say to my
brethern I ascend up to my fader and your fader: to my god and your god / And
ferdermot^ our lord homely comynyng with her: spoke to her in this manner /
woost thou not well daughter that I told the before my passion that I should
rise the third day from death to life? And why would thou then so besily
seek me in the sepulcre / And she said / Soothly master I say you that my
heart was filled with so great sorrow of the bitterness of your hard passion
and death that I foryate all other thing. and only thought of your bod^ deed
and beried: and on the place that it was beryed in / And therefore I brought
now the oynement for to have enoynted with your glorious body / Blessed be your
almighty godhede. where through ye would rise fro death. and come again to us /
And so they two true lovers stoden and spaken together with great likynge and
Joye / And she curyously beholds his glorious body. and askith what her
lykith: and he in all thing ansuerde plesyngly to her pay / And ferdermore
though our lord so strangly as it semyth ansuerde her at the beginning.
biddynge her that she should not touch him nevertheless I may not trow. but
that afterward he suffered her to touch him. and to kiss both hondes and
fete. or they departed / For we may suppose and goodly trow: that sithe^ he
would so affectuously and specially after his own mother first before all
other vysite and appear to. that he would not thereby in any manner distourble
her or heavy her / But rather in all points comfort her. and therefore the good
lord that is so benygne and full of swetnesse namly to all those that truly
louen him spoke not to her the foresaid words in strange manner and boystously
in mystery showing her inperfyte affecco^n as it is said: and willinge lift up
her heart holy to god and to heavenly things as says saint bernarde / Then^e
said our lord that he would goo fro her and vysite and comfort other / And
maudleyne turned then^e somewhat in sorrow: for she would never have been
departed fro him. and said / O good lord I see well now that your
conuersaco^n wol not be with us in manner as it has here before / but good
master have ever in mind of me / And of the great goodness and homelynesse and
y^ special love that ye had to me / And so thinks ever on me (...) re lord
god / And he ansuerde / Dread not: but be sted^aste. and trust well that I
shall ever be with the / And so she taking devoutly his blessing: and he
vanysshynge away fro her She came to her fellows: and told hem all the
foresaid process / wherefore they were glad: as to wchynge his Resurrecyon /
But that they saw him not with her: they were beuy and sorry / But the good
lord suffered not their sorrow long last / But soon comfort hem as it

better than thyself: and therefore I told the before / But now goo and comfort
and stable thy brethren / And believe sadly that I have overcome al your enmyes

beholds him. and takyth head of all things. and after his blessyng taken: he
went home again with great Joy tellyng our lady and the discyples what he had
seen: and herd / Ot this process of thapperynge to peter is not expressed in
the gospel. but thus by devout ymagynaco^n I have set it her before other
aperynges yt folowen / For so it semyth that holy church hold as it is
contained more plainly in the legende of the Resurreccyon /

hou our lord apered to y^ ii disciples going to ward y^ castle of Emaus ca
lvi.
THe self day of resurrecco^n as ii. dysciples of Jhu^ yeden toward ye
castle Emaus. and morning: and in manner of despayr talkinge together by the way
of yt befell the fridaye before. our lord Jhu^s came in manner of a pilgrim
and felishiped with he^: askyng hem questions: and ansueryng and tellin hem
sweet words of edifycaco^n. as ye process of ye gospel of luke tellyth
plainly and at the last byden: drawn. and constrained to enter to duelle with
hem. showed him to hem: and was known in the bread brekyng / Here may we
understand and see the great goodness and the benygnyte of our lord Jhu^ in
many manners / First he showed his godenes in y^ his fervent love would not
suffer his beloved discyples long err: and be sorry / Sothly he is a true
friend and a comfortable felawe. and a benygne lord / For loo he Joyneth and
feloweth him to hem homely / He askyth the cause of her sorrow and heaviness
goodly. and he expowneth the scriptures to hem wisely: and enfla^meth her
hertes ghostly. consumynge all the rust of mysbileue / Thus he does with us
all day ghostly / For what time we ben in any perplexite ouerlayed with
heaviness or sloth. and we speak and common together of Jhu^. anon he comyth to
us co^fortyng us and lightnyng our hertes. qm^dul^i a facibus Ignitu^
and enfla^myng to the love of him / For the best medicyn against such ghostly
sykenesse is for to speak of god. as the prophet dauyd says / Lord how sweet
ben thy speches and thy words to my chekes. ye passing honey to my mouth / And
in a another place: thy speech is greatly enflammed: as fire thorugh werchinge of
the holy ghost. and I thy seruau^te loved it Also to think on god and the
great goodness of Jhu^* helpyth much in temptaco^n and disease: as the self
prophet says / My heart verily heted with the fire of crystis love and in
meditaco^n of Jhesu shall bren^e fire of perfyte love / Also we may see here
the goodness of our lord Jhu^ not oonly in love as it is said. but also in his
profounde meekness / As if we take heed how lowely and mekely he gooth with
hem: that is to say the high lord of lords with his simple servants as
one of hem kepinge now the meekness in his body glorified that he showed
before in his body dedely / And yeuynge us ensample to follow him in that
virtue / yet also here we may understand the mekenes of our lord Jhu^ in
that he made him self so homely with those ii. simple discyples the which were
of lower degree. thanne the apostles / But this done not proud men for they
woll not gladly goo and speak: and be conuersau^te. but with hem that been of
great fame and of high astate toward the world / And yet ferdermore here is
showed his meekness in the third point against pronde men / For as we may
see. they woll not gladly show her wisdom and her curious words among few
folk / But our sovereign master of all wysdom has none dysdayn of few. for be
shewyth his pryue wisdom and high mysteryes not oonly to two. as now as this
time* but also to one as he did before with the woman Samarytane / More over
we may consider the great godenes of our lord Jhu^ in all the process of the
gospel for said: that is to say how he enformeth his disciples in maneres /
Also fedeth and comfort / And specially how he feynyth him to goo ferder
unto that end for to kyndle and encreace her desire and affecco^n to him. and
to be more fervently bydden: and witholden of hem / And ferdermore how
beningnely he enters and goth in with hem: after takith bread and blessith it:
and with his holy hondes brekyth. and yeuyth it to hem: and then^e shewyth
himself to hem / Thus he does with us every day ghostly / for he would be
bydde of us to dwell with us and drawn with fervent desires: devout prayers
and holy me dytaco^ns / And therefore as he has taught us. it behouyth ever to
pray and not fail: but that we take in mind the works of pity and
hospitalyte / And how it suffyceth not to read or here ye words and the
biddynges of god. but they ben performed in deed: as we may here of more
plainly be informed in the omely of saint gregory upon this gospel / At last
our lord Ihu^s willing also to wisyte and comfort other dwelled not long
with thise discyples / But as soon as he had broken and yeuen hem the bread. he
vanysshed away fro her eyes /

How our lord Ihu^s appeared to his apostles and discyples yt were reclused for
dread on the self day of his resurrecco^n / Caplm lvii.


When the two forsaid dyscyples were thus comforted as it is said by the
presence of our lord / Anon for Joye they turned again to Jherusalem And
camen to the Appostles and other discyples there pryuely gadred. But thomas
absent / And told hem the forsaid process. and herden again ward of theymthat
soothly our lord is risen and has appeared to peter / And there with suddenly
our lord Jhesus entryn ge into hem: and the yates closed stood in mids of
hem: and said / Pees to you / And anon they falling down to the earth and
cetera / Lrnowlegynge her gylte in that y^ they had so left him and forsaken
/ Receyueden him with great Joye / And then said he to hem / Ryseth up
brethren. and be of good comfort / For all your sins ben foryeue you / And
so stondeth Thu^s among his discyples spekyng homely with hem: and showing
hem booth his hand and his side / And openyth her wits to understanding
clearly holy scryptures. and for to know sothfastly his resurrecco^n / He
asks whether they have ought that is to be eten / And he etith homely before
hem a part of a roasted fysshe. and of a honey comb to preue his very body
present and risen / After he bretheth on hem: and yeuith h^ the holy ghost /
Loo if we take Juwardly head. all thise forsa^de things ben full sweet and
full of ghostly liking* For they then were the disciples Joyefull in the
syghte of our lord the which were before dreadful and heavy / Lord god how
gladly they yeuen him that he askyth. how truly they served ^ mynystred him.
and how merrily they stoden about him* But herwyth behold we our lady his
blessed mother that was there present in that time / For to her were the
discyples gad^ed How she takyth head. to al those things done of her sweet
sone with unspeakable Joye sittynge by him homly. and seruinge him full gladly /
And our lord takyth gladly her service and worshippeth her therwyth before the
discyples* And yet morouer foryete we not here mary maudleyne the byloued
discyplesse. and of thapostles apostlesse* how she after her old manner
sittyth at the fete of her master* and besily hereth his words in all that
she may gladly: and with good will minystreth O lord Jhu^ how worthy is that
lityll house. and how likyng and gracyous it is to dwell therein / Sothly who so
has any deuoco^n and ghostly taast he may see and feel that here is now a
great paske / But our lord Jhesus stood but a lityll while Inward Joye of
crystes Resurrecco^n* that is sothfastnesse en sample and erneste of our
Resurrecco^n to come when we shall rise in body and soul to life everlasting
/ And thus much be said at this time to wchynge this holy paske day /

How our lord Thu^s apered the viii. day after to his discyples Thomas
present Johis. ii. viii. Eaplm lviii:
When the viii. day of his Resurreccyon was come / Our lord Thu^s appeared eft
to his dyscyples in the forsayde place. and the yates closed where Thomas was
then^e present with hem. that was not so the first day before said / And
after his fellows hadden told him: how they had seen her lord / And he not
byleuyng: but yt he might touch him as the process of the gospel plainly
tellyth / Then^e the good herdman of his errynge sheep* besy and having
compassion suddenly stondynge in mids of hem* and said Pees to you And
therwyth tornyng him specially to thomas said / Putt in thy finger hyder: and
see and touch my hondes: and bring fourth thyn hand and putt it in to my side
/ And be no more of mysbyleue. but h^sforwarde truly byleuyng / And then^e
reverently Thomas knelyng down with both Joye and dread touched his wou^des
as he badde and said / My lord and my god He saw him man* and byleued him god
/ And then^e also he knouleged his gylte in that he had forsaken him. as other
dyden also * And our lord goodly taking him up said / Dread not: all thy
sins ben foryeue / And this long doubt and mysbyleue of thomas was of the
great godenes of our lord in that manner suffered for our profit to the more
open pre if and certaynte of his very resurreccyon / And so we may see here
the great benygnytee. meekness: and fervent love of our lord Jhesu in that
y^ he shewyth to Thomas and his other discyples so openly his wou^des for to
put away fro her hertes all manner derkenesse of mysbyleue to both hers and
ours great profit / And specially our lord reserved in his glorious body the
steps of his wounds for iii* skylles: that is to say / First to confermyng
of the faith of his resurrecco^n N. bil
to t(...) discyples / And secondly for to show hem to the fader. (...) woll
pray for us: and make him plesed to us: for (...)r special and sovereign
advocate in that party / And th(...)de skylle is for to show hem at the day
of dome to y^ reproved people unto her confusion * And so stondeth our lord
with his blessed mother: and maudleyne and his discyples as long as him list.
comynynge homely with hem. in manner as it is said in the next chapyter to be
had in contemplaco^n And then^e at last he badde hem goo in to galile: to the
mount Thabor as it is said / For there he said he would speak more with hem /
And then yeuynge hem his blessing. he passed away fro hem /

How our lord Jhesus appeared to his dyscyples in galyle Caplm lix.
AFter the discyples were gone in to Galyle. as our lord badde: there he
appeared efte to hem ^ said / There is yeuen to men all the power in heaven and
in earth / Gooth now and (...)
teache all manner of people baptisynge hem in the name of the fader and the sone
and the holy ghost* and techynge hem to keep all those things that I have
bydden you: and be of good comfort / For loo I am with you all the days. in
to the worlds end / And they honored him at his cominge: and stonden after
with him full Joyeful and glad Now take we good head to the foresaid words:
for they ben full comfortable and worthy / First he shewyth to hem that he is
lord of all thing After he yeuyth hem auctoryte and mau^dement to preche* The
third he yeuyth hem the form of baptisynge / And at last the strongest
hold and comfort that they might have: when he says: that he shall ever be
with hem / ^oo what Joye and comfort he yeueth hem / And how many great tokens
of charytee he shewyth to hem / And so yeuynge hem his blessing: he passed
away fro hem /

How our lord Jhu^s apered to the discyples at the sea Tyberiadis / Johis xxi.
Caplm lx.
Dwelling yet the discyples in Galyle. upon a time vii. of them wenten to
fysshe in the sea of Tiberyadis: as the gospel tellith in process: the which
I pass over But if we take heed Inwardly to all those things that were there
spoken and done we may find much ghostly mirthe and comfort in hem. and
namly in that solemn feast that our lord made there to hem / In the which
he homely etynge with hem: and as his manner always was mekely serving he^: full
likyngly fed hem: not only bodily. but much more ghostly whereof he give us
part and ghostly Jhu^s for his mercy. Amen /

After the foresaid feast complete our lord asked of peter de petro
whether he loved him more than other: and eft. and the thyr de time asking
whether he loved him / At every time he co^me^ded to him his people y^ he should
after gouern^. and badde him feed his sheep / wherein we may see the proper
benignyte and me kenes of our lord Jhu^s. and specially his high charity and
de petro and Jo^e
the great lone that he has to our souls / And after he tellith before to
peter the death that he should suffer for his love / And peter willing to wite
also of John that followed with him in what manner he should deye: was ansuerde
thus of our lord I woll that he dwell so till I come / As who says: I woll
not that he follow me as thou by the passion suffrynge: but y^ in his full age
and contemplaco^n: he end this life in pees. Nevertheless other discyples mys
vndstode by that word that he should not have deyed. and yet had not that been
a great yeft, sy then it is better to be bodily deed. and dwell ever with
christ. as the appostle says / After this our lord Jhesus passed a way fro
them: and went again as he was wont to the holy faders in paradyse / Also our
lord Jhesus appeared a another time to moo than five hundred discyples and
brethern gade Apparu (...) Jhu^s ^ngent* fribus
red together / As the appostle poul wytnessyth / But where. or what time or how
it is not written / Nevertheless we may suppose that it was as he was wont with
great charity meke nesse and goodness on his side. and with great Joye and
comfort on her side / And so have we now touched of xii. apperynges of our
lord Jhu^ after his resurrecco^n without two y^ folowen after in his ascenco^n
/

Of all the Apperynges of our lord Jhesu in generalle Caplm lxi.
THough it so be that our lord Jhu^s appeared in druerse manner after his
resurreccyon xiiii. times as it is said Netheles the gospel specifyeth not.
but only of x. For how he apered to his mother: it is not written in any place.
but we resonably and devoutly trow it: as it is said before Also of other iii.
apperynges: that is to say to Joseph: to James. and mo than v. C. brethern is
specyfied before where they ben written: but not in the gospel / Also we may
well suppose of many mo For it is lykly that he the most benign lord often
times visited both his mother and his dyscyples: and maudleyne his special
beloved: comfortynge and gladynge hem specially that were in his passion most
dreadful and sorry And that semyth that saint augustyn felt where he says thus
/ Of our lords body apperynge his Resurrecco^n. all things ben not written /
For his conuersaco^n with hem was often times: and peraue^ ture also the holy
faders namly abraham and dauyd To whom was made of god the special byheste of
the Incarnacyon of gods sone comen often times with him to see that most
excellent vyrgyne. her daughter and goddis mother / The which for hem and all
other found so great grace. and that bare her savior and all mankind / O
lord god. how likyngely they beheld her / How reverently they enclyned to her
/ And with all devotion that they cowde they blessed her: and honored her /
Though it so were that they were not seen of her Also in all thise we may
consider the great benygnytee the high charytee and the profounde meekness of
our lord Jhesu as we ben wont / Of the which often times we have made mind.
and the which shown in all his deeds / And specially he in that here would
after his resurrecco^n and glorious vyctory. not stye up anon to his bliss /
But in manner of a pilgrim forty days abide here in earth / To conferme and
strength his discyples and us in hem / And that not by his angels as he might
lightly have done: but compellinge him by his high charytee / He would oonly
do that in his own person. and bodily be conuersaunt with hem. aperynge to
hem as it is said forty days. and speaking of the kingdom of god / And all
this he did not oonly for hem: but for us / And yet we can not se it / He has
loved us. and yet he loves us so fervently. and yet we love not him again
ward / And that is a great reprouable unkindness in us / For at so great
sire of love we should not be made hot / But by reason we shall fully brenne /
But now leuynge this / Goo we to the glorious Ascenco^n /

Of the Ascenco^n of our lord Jhesu / Caplm lxii.


Touching the wonderful Ascencyon of our lord Jhesu. thou that herest or
redest this: if thou wolt feel the swetnes thereof / I woll that thou be wakeli
and quick in thy soul. so ferforth. that if ever herby fore as it was byden
the: you made the by devout yma gynaco^n as present to his words and deeds /
Now you do much more with all thy might / For this solemn nyte passes all
other. as I shall clerly show the with in forth in process. and namly this
one thing should stire and heart thyn entenco^n: and quyck thin affecco^n. yt
thy lord is now in passing away fro y^ as by his bodily presence the time of
his pilgrimage here in earth with the fully co^plete and ended wherefore his
words and deeds may be the more atte^tyfly and besily to be co^sidred / For
sothly every criste^ soul should her spouse her lord and her god in his away
passing most wakly and besily take tent to And tho things yt be^ by him spoken
and done. most inwardli set in mind. and most devoutly and mekely reco^mende
here to him. and utterly withdraw al her mind in this time fro al other
things. and set it holy upon her spouse / For to go then^e to y^ process of
thascenco^n of our lord Jhu^ / we shall have in mind y^ on the xl. day after
his resurrecco^n: our lord Jhu^s knowing y^ his time was come for to pass fro
this world to the fader. taki^ge out of paradyse terrestre the holy faders and
all the blessed souls: and blessinge enoch and hely that there abidyng still
yet living he came to his discyples: the which were together that time in mount
Syon and in the place where he made that worthy supper the night before his
passion there being then^e with his blessed mother and other discyples / And
so aperynge to hem he would ete with hem or he passed fro hem in a special
token and a memoryall of love and Joye to hem / wherefore all etynge together
with great Joye and myrthe in this last feast of our lord Jhu^ / Then said
he to hem / Time is come now that I torn again to him that sent me / But ye
shall dwell and a bide in the cite till ye ben new clothed ghostly through
virtue that shall come fro above / For sothly within few days here after ye
shall be fulfilled with the holy ghost as I behighte you / And after ye shall
go and preche my gospel through all y^ world baptisynge hem that woll believe
in me / And so ye shall be my witness in to the vttreste end of the earth /
Also he reprehended hem or abreyde hem now specially when he byddeth hem preche
of her mysbyleue in that: that they trowed not to hem that say him be vpryse^
and that were the angels / And though he said to them in this manner sentence:
to make hem understand / Much more ye should have trowen and byued to the
angels or ye saw me. than the people shall trow to your prechyng. the which
shall not see me / Also he reproved and abreyde then^e her mysbyleue. for they
should know first her own defawte: and thereby be the more meke she wyng him
now in this departing: how much it plesed him mekenes / And therefore specially
he reco^mende it at the last to hem / Then they asked him of those things
that were to come after but he would not tell hem / For it was not spedefull
to hem to know the preuytees of god. the which the fader had reserved. and
set in his own power. to fulfill when him liked / Thus stonden they together
etynge and speaking with great Joye to hem of the blessed presence of her lord
/ But nevertheless with great dread and trowblaunce of his away passing /
And no wonder / For they loved him so tenderly that they might not with easy
heart bear the words of his bodily departing fro hem and namly our lady his
blessed mother that loved him passing all other / We may well suppose that she
touched and styred soueraynly wych y^ swetnes of moderly love: as she sat next
him at that mete: laid down her head swetely. and rested upon his blessed
breast. as saint Johan did before in that foresaid most worthy supper: and so
with sweet teeres sighyng she spoke to him in this manner prayeng / My dear
sone if thou wolt always goo to thy fader I pray y^ led me with the / And our
lord co^fortyng her said I pray the my dear mother take not heuily my goinge
fro the for I goo to the fader for thy best. and it is spedful that you dwelest
here yet awhile to co^ferme hem. thall shall truly believe in me And after I
shall come and take the with me in everlasting bliss / And then^e she said /
My sweet sone thy will be d^ne. for not only I am ready to abide at thy will
but also to suffer death for tho souls y^ thou suffredest death fore / But ever
I beseech the have mind on me / And then^e our lord comforted morouer her and
maudleyn and other saying thus to hem / Be not your heart troubled and dread ye
not. for I shall not leave you desolate as faderlees / For I shall goo and come
and ever be with you And at the last he badde hem goo in to the mou^te of
olyuete. for the^s he would stie up and so passed at yt time away fro he^ And
anon right his mother and all other without taryenge yeden in to the foresaid
mount: y^ is fro Jhrlm about a mile. and ther^ anon our lord apered to hem /
Loo here we have on this day two aperynges / Then^e clippyd he and kyssed his
mother taking leave. and she again ward clippyd and kiss him full tenderly /
And the dyscyples and maudleyne and other falling down to the ground and
weeping kisseden his fete devoutly. and he taking hem up kyssed all his
apostles benygnely / Now take heed Inwardly of hem: and of all that here ben
done / And therwyth behold the holy faders there being Inuysible: how gladly
and reuere^tly they beholden and Inwardly blessen her by whom they have
received so great a benefyce of her sauacy on / They beholden tho worthy
cha^pyons and leders of goddis oost: the which among all other people our
lord Jhu^s specially has chosen for to conquer all the world / At y^ last
when all the mysteryes were complete and fulfilled. our lord No^ processu^
asce^cionis
Jhesus began to be lift up fro hem: and to stye up by his own virtue / And
then our lady and all other fellen down to the earth worshyppynge him / And
our lady said / My blessed sone Jhesu: think on me / And therewith she might
not with hold her fro wepyuge by cause of his gooynge / Nevertheless she was
full Joyefull that she saw her sone so gloryously stye up to heaven / Also the
discyples this seenge sayden / Lord we have forsaken all worlds goods for
the have mind on us / And so he having his hondes lift up: and blessyng he^
with a bryghte Joyefull face / Crowned worthily as a king gloryously arrayed
styenge up to heaven: and said / Be steadfast and werchyth manfully / For I
shall ever be with you / And so our lord Jhesus all glorious white and rudye
shinynge. and* Joyefull ledynge with him that noble multitude and gooynge
before and showing the way to hem in deed fulfilled then that the prophets
had said long before of his ascenco^n / And they also with vnspeable Joye
following him songen merely the psalms and ympnes of his louyuge as perteyned
to yt blisfull time of her delyuerau^ce fro all sorrow and enter in to all
bliss without end / And in that time the archangel mychael prouoste of
paradise gooyng bofore told the blessed court of heaven that our lord Jhu^s
was coming and vpstyenge / And anon all the blessed spirytes after her orders
yeden again her lord none left behind: and metynge with him and worshippyuge*
him with all the reverence yt they cowde: ladde him with hympnes and songs of
Joye that may not be spoken nor thought / And so metynge together the holy
faders and the blessed spirytes and syngen alleluya: and most Joyefull songs
with reverence before him. maden a great sole^pnyte and a worshipful feast: ye
lord who might tell what fest y^ was. and in what Joye they hadden when they
met togider: And when they had done due reverence to our lord: and fulfilled
her merry songs that perteynen to his glorious ascenco^n they turned hem each
to other both the blessed spirytes and the holy princeps ap^o^
faders reioycynge and syngyuge / And first the holy spirytes in this manner
saying / ye princes of people. be welcome. and Joyeful we ben of your coming /
All ye are now here gadred and wonderfully lift up with your god: Alleluya /
Therefore make mirth: and syngeth now to him* that so gloryously styed up
princeps ppl^^^
above heaven and heaven. Alleluya / And the holy faders Joyefully ansuerde / To
you princes of goddis people alieluya* Our kepers and helpers alleluya. Joye and
pees be ever alleluya Syngyth and makyth mirth also to our god king and
savior. Alleluya alla alleluya / And ferdermore all together songen and sayden
in do^^ dn^^le
Now we go merely in to the house of our lord alleluya: and that worshipful
cite of god that shall receive us all together alleluya / In ympnes and songs
of Joye and myrthe Alleluya alleluya / Loo here was much myrthe and Joye / All
they songen and soueraynly Joyeden as the prophet dauyd says / God styeth in
to heaven in most wonderfully Joye of the appostles ascend^^ d^^in in bilaco^ne
that saw him that time / And in voice of trompe / That is in voice of angels
that apered then and spoke to the appostles / Sothly our lord Jhesus styed
up then openly to the comfort of his mother / And the appostles as long as
her bodily syghte would suffyse to see him / And after a briyght cloud took
him fro her eyes / And anon in a moment that is in an vnperceyuable short
time. he was with all his angels and the foresaid faders in the highest heaven /
O lord what Joye was then to see that blessed lord so glorious up styenge
/ Sothly I trow who so might have seen that as the appostles dyden. and
therwyth herd that Joyful song of angels and holy souls with him up styenge
for that passing Joye of his soul should have be departed fro the body. and
goon up to heaven also with hem: and no wonder / wherfo^ our lord knowing the
Infyrmyte of mankind in bodily life here. would show some of his bliss to
his mother and other discyples. In as much as they might bear that was in that
blisfull vpstyeng of him. and hid ^ro hem. that they might not bear so in
flesshly living / And therefore also he sent to hem u. angels in man^es
lickenes that they should not over much be traueyled in y^ stondyng and
lokynge up after him in to heaven* For they were so rauysshed by yt blysfull
sight of him that they hadden foryete hemself / And also he sent than gels to
comfort hem: in that they herd the angels witness according with hem: of
thascenco^n of our lord / And when ye angels had bidden hem that they should
no longer look after Jhu^s bodily presence in that form that they saw him
then^e stye up in to that time that he should come in that self form bodily to
deem all quycke and deed / But that they should torn a yen in to the cite and
there abide the holy ghost as he had said he^ before Then^e our lady prayed

our lord Jhu^. beholding in ymagynaco^n of heavenly things by lykenes of
erthly things. how he with all yt foresaid worthy and blysful multitude of holy
souls opening heaven yates that were before that time spered against mankind
as a worthy conqueror Joyefully entered: and gladly before the foresaid fader /
Fader I thank the that thou have yeuen me the vycto ry of all our enmyes and
adversaries / And loo fader here I present to ye our friends yt were holden in
thraldom / And for asmoche as I have behight to my brethern and discyples. ye
which I have left in the world to send to hem the holy ghost / I pray the
fader fulfill my byhest. and I reco^mende hem also to the / Then^e the fader
taking him up made him sytte on his right hand. and said / My blessed sone al
power and dome I have yeuen to the. and therefore of that thou askedest dyspose
and do as the lyketh / After that all the holy faders and blessed spirytes.
the which had in worshping of the holy trynyte fall down lowely with all
reverence. risynge up began again to sing her songs of myrthe: and unspeakable
Jore before the trone of god / For sithen moses and the chyldern of Israhel
songen in thankyng and loving of god: when they were passed ye reed see. and
her enmyes therein drowned / And also the self time mary aarons sister with
other wym^en her following in tym panes and other melodye dau^sen and songen to
goddis loving Also dauyd with his people ledynge the ark of god in to
Jherusalem* harped and daunsed for Joye before the arc. and chau^ters songen:
and in other diverse myntralsye. they honored and worshipped god / And also
saint Johan says in the apocalip se that he herd a voys in heaven of an
hundred and forty and four thousand harpes harpyng and singing a new song
before the throne and the seet of the very lamb Jhesu Much more we resonably
trow: that now in this Joyefule time when Jhu^s with his company passed all
sorrow. and al his adversaries were so gracyously overcome / And he that was
tokened by the arc Jhu^s was so gracyously come in to the cite of heavenly
Jherusalem / All that blessed felyship of spirytes and souls without number
songen and maden Joye and myrthe that no tongue may tell ne heart think /
Soothly now in that blessed cytee of heavenly Jherusalem is songeu and herd yt
souerayn song of Joye. and after the prophecy of thobie by all the streets
thereof is songen Alleluya: that is as much No^ excel lencia^ festi asce^ci
oi^s su^ a lia festa
to say as loving be to our lord / Never from the begyn^yng was there so
sole^pne and so Joyefull a feast. ne never peraue^ sure shall be / But at the
last after the day of dome wha^ all the chosen souls shall be presented
there with her bodies gloryfyed / And therefore as I said at begyn^ynge of this
chapyter This sole^pnyte all things considred passes all other / Take
Incarnacio
head of each of hem: and see whether it be so that I say First the
Incarnacyon of our lord Jhu^ is a solemn feast and worthy / For that was the
begyn^ynge of all our good and our Natiuitas
sauaco^n / But that was our Joye and not his: for he was closed then^e in his
moders womb / Also the natyuyte is a sole^pne and high feast. and worthy
myrthe to be made therein / but that is also as on our side / For as on his side
we owen to have compasso^n of him that was for us borne in so great pouertee /
Hardenesse of weder and other abiecco^n / Also as to us Passio
his passion is a great feast. through the which we ben brought out of the
feudes thraldom / And all our sins ben for give. and done away / And as
saint gregory says / It had not auaylled us to be borne. but it had also
profyted us for to be boughte / Nevertheless for the great torments of him: and
yt hardest and most despytous death that he suffered for our Redempcyon
Resurreccio
and byenge: there was no matere of Joye: but rather of sorrow both to him in
that paynfull suffrynge and to us for our sinful deseruynge / Ferdermore yet
the resurrecco^n of our lord Jhesu is a glorious solemn and a Joyful feast:
both for him and for us: for then was his body gloryfied: and all pain and
sorrow passed. and we iustyfied: and have an ernest and ensample without doubt
of our last vprysynge in body and soul / And therefore of this worshipful and
Joyful Hec e^ dies qua^ fecit dn^s
day special syngeth holy church by ye words of the prophet dauyd / This
is the day of our lord made: be we merry therein and glad / And as augustyn
says in a sermon / This day is holiest of all other. but that may be
understand of all other before that day / For this of the ascenco^n by reason
is gretter and holyer* and that touching three parties / That is to say our
lord himself: the blessed spirytes in heaven. and mankind in earth / For as to
the first: though our lord had then^e gloryously in body and soul vprysen
fro death to life everlasting: nevertheless he was bodily yet as a pilgryme in
earth fro his own kind heritage and reame / Also as to the second. yet say
not y^ angels her felishyp increased by season taking of mankind with hem in
bliss / And as ane^st the third. yet was closed and shytte the yate of
heavenly paradyse: and yet were not the holy faders and souls presented to the
fader of heaven: the which all three were co^plete and fulfilled in his holy
ascenco^n / And if we take good head we may see: that all that god wroughte
and did. he did for to come to this end / And without this all his works
had been as Inperfite / For lo heaven and earth and all that is made in hem. is
made for man / And man for to have the bliss of heaven / And thereto might no
man come after ^^op^^^
he had sinned in to this day. were he never so good and rightwys / And so
we may see how worthy this holy day is / yet more over this feast of
penthcoste is high and holy* And worthily holy church makyth it solemn /
For then was yeuen thereto that high worthiest yefte. that is the holy ghost
Ascenco^
But this is to us and not to him / But this ascencyon day is properly the
most solemn feast of our lord Jhesu For Fm^ Jhu^
this day first in his manhede he began to sytte on the taders right hand
in bliss / And took full rest of his pilgrimage before / All this is properly
the feast of all the blessed spyrytes Ascenco^
in heaven / For this day they had a new Joye of her lord whom they saw
never before there in his manhede* And also Ascenco^ Fm^ angelo
for this day began first to be restored the falling down of her fellows /
And that in so great a multitude and nombre of blessed souls of patryarkes
and prophets* And all the holy souls that this day entered first in to that
blessid cite of heavenly Jhrlm her kind heritage above / wherefore sy then we
maken sole^pne the feast of one saint that is passyd out of this world to heaven
/ Much more we owen to do of so many thousands. and yet passingly of him
that is saint Ascencio Fm^ dn^e
of all saints / Also this is specialli the fest of our lady: for as much as
this day she saw her blessed sone Jhu^ very god and man so gloryously
crowned as king steye up to heaven yet this day is properly our feast / For
this day was first our kind exalted and lift up oboue the heue^s / And also
for but if christ had so styen up. y^ worthy yeft of the holy ghost whereof we
make sole^pnyte we might not have received to his disciples / ^t is spedful to
you that I goo up to the fader. for but if I goo fro you. the holy ghost
comforter shall not com^ to you*And therefore says saint bernarde in a sermon
of this feast of thascenco^n in the co^fermaco^n of my foresaid sentence that
this glorious feast of thascencion of our lord Jhu^ is an end and a
fulfillyng of all other solempnytees and festes: and blessed conclusion of all
the Journeye of our lord Jhu^ his manhede / Thus may we openly see: that this
day and this feast is much high and solemn of all other: and that soul
that loved truly our lord Jhu^ should this day be more rauysshed to heaven: and
more ghostly Joye have in heart than in any day of the year / For thus said
our lord Jhu^s to his discyples / if ye loved me. soothly ye should be glad
and Joyefull for that I goo to the fader* wherfor^ I leave that I said truly
before that was in heaven never a day so Joyefull. and so solemn as this
day / And so this day and this solempnyte lasted in to the day of
penthecoste / whereof we may devoutly ymagyne and have medytaco^n in this manner
/ The ascenco^n of our lord was at the serte hour / For before he ete with his
discyples at tyerce / Then^e may we thus ymagyne y^ those x-dayes fro y^ hour
that he ascended into the hour of the holy ghost sending the ix* orders of
angels with the holy faders and souls that he took up with him made him x.
festes: and he again ward reward ded hem specially in some synguler comfort
every day. and so though all that were then^e in heaven generally were of his
ascenco^n Joyefull. and made so merry a feast that no tongue can tell /
Nevertheless the first day fro the hour of his ascenco^n in to the sexte of the
next day following angels maden her feast / Te second day in the self manner
maden her feast ar cha^gels. the third day virtutes: the fourth day
potestates: the fyfth day pryncipatus. the sexte day domynaco^nes. the seventh
day thrones. the eight day cherubyn: the ninthe day seraphin And so thise
nine orders of angels co^tynued her festes in to the sexte hour of the vigyll
of penthcost / And fro thens in to tyerce of the day following* that is the
sunday of penthcost the holy faders with her felyshyp made her feast to Jhu^s.
blessed be he without end /

Amen
Of the sendyng down of the holy ghost / Caplm lxiii


AFter that our Lord Jhesus was goone vpp^ to his bliss / And the angels had
bydden the dyscyples to turn again in to the cite. as it was said next
before: they with his blessed mother worshippinge him. and kissyng deuoutely the
steps of his fete where he last towched the earth. as the gospel of Luke
tellyth: they went again in to Jherusalem with great Joye. and there they
abyden the coming of y^ holy ghost contynuelly in devout prayers loving god
and blessinge our lord / And when the tenth day was come fro his Ascenco^n:
then^e was the fyfthy day of his resurrecco^n. our lord Jhu^s Joynynge the
figure of tholde testament with the new For asmoche as the time of grace was in
that day come / he said to the fader thus / My fader hauith now in mind the
byhest that I made to my brethern of the holy ghost / And the fader ansuerd /
My dear sone: I am well apaid of that byhest. and now it is time that it be
fulfilled / And morouer he said to y^ holy ghost / we pray the: that thou goo
down to our discyples And that thou fylle hem of thy grace: comfort hem.
strength hem: teache hem. and give hem habu^daunce of virtues and Joye / And
anon the holy ghost came down with a wonderful noise N
in bren^ynge tongues upon an hundred and twenty discyples gadred that time
togider: and fyllid hem with all Joye virtues and grace* By virtue whereof the
discypled strengthed: taught lyghted. and enfla^med: yeden after by all
parties of the world and made it subget to hem in great party / This is a
worthi feast. and among other a sweet and lovely feast / For this is the feast
of him that is love properly as saint Gregory says: yt the holy ghost is love
/ wherefore he that loves god: should in this feast specially be enfla^med with
love: or at the leest with a brennynge desire to love / But this woll not be
with flesshly or wordly love meddled as saint bernard says in a sermon bernarde
of the ascenco^n in this manner sentence / He erryth greatly: who so he is that
weneth for to meddle together that heavenly Joye with thise bitter ashes of
flesshly likynge / Or that sweet ghostly baume with this venym: or those
gracious yeftes of the holy ghost with thise lynkynge lusts / And no wonder
For as the self bernarde says / Thapostles for the time that they hadden his
bodily presence with hem* for the love that they hadden to his body. though it
was holy and good: yet for yt time they were unable to receive perfytly y^ holy
ghost as he said himself / But if I goo fro you: the holy ghost shall not
Nisiego abiero
come to you / Much more then^e he that is knytte with love to rotten mucke:
or to a stynkyng carrayn. is in all manner unable to that clen^est and swetest
love of the holy ghost / For there is none accord and knyttynge together of
sothfastnes and vanyte of light and derkenes of the spirit and the flesh of
fire and cold water / But thou perauenture that felest not the swetnesse and
comfort of that ghostly likynge and love say to me with out comfort of love
and likynge I may not be* what shall I not do then^e while I feel not that
ghostly love / Saint bernarde ansuereth thus and says to the / Forsake first
fully and truly all vain worlds comfort: and all flesshly love and liking.
and abide awhyle in devout prayers: as the appostles dyden abiding the holy
ghost: whereof they knew no certain time And thou shall feel within short
time. that he shall come and comfort the better than thou cowdest before know
or think. and in great comfort of him that forsakyth worldly comfort for god
/ The same saint bernarde concluded in thise words / The apostles in this
bidyng seten perseuerau^t with one No bn^
will together in prayer with the woman mary Jhu^s mother / And in the self
manner learn thou to pray: learn thou to seek No bernardum
to ask and knock at the door: till thou find. till thou take and till it be
opened to the / Our lord knows thy freeyll and feeble kind. and he is true:
and wol not suffer the to be tempted more than you may bear / And I trust in
him: that if thou wolt abide truly: thou shall not abide the tenth day. but
that he shall come before and comfort thy desolate soul / And so prayenge in
his blessings of ghostly swetnesse. so that you shalt have so great likyng
in his mind. and in those ghostly drinks that he shall make the drunk often in
soul: that you shall be Joyful and glad that ever thou forsook the false
comfortes of the world / Loo by this forsaid sentence of saint bernarde we
may see in party what behouyth to receive the holy Ghost and his love /
wherefore that we may be able to receive here that great yefte of the holy
ghost and his comfort. and after come to ye bliss yt our lord Jhu^s is now
steyen up. and has made our way before us. leave we and hate we al falls love
and likyng of this wretched world / And set we not our love on the stynkyng
flessh and nourissh we it not in desires: but desire we co^tynuelly for to be
departed therfro / So yt through the grace of the holy ghost helping us we may
follow somewhat the blessed life of our lord in this world. and after goo up to
him: and to our kind heritage of bliss in the gloryious cytee of heavenly
Jhrlm. where he souerain king with the fader and the holy ghost one god in
trinyte lives and regneth without end / Amen

Thus ends the contemplaco^n of the blessed life of our lord Jhu^: the
which process for asmoche as it is here thus written in english tongue longer
in many parties and in other manner than is the laten of Bonauenture*therfore it
semyth not convenient to follow the process thereof by the days of the weke
after thentent of the foresaid Bonauenture / For it were to tedious as me
thinks: and also it should so soon be fulsome. and not in comfortable
deyntees: by cause of the freilte of mankind that has likynge to here and to
know new things. and those that been seldom herd. ben often in the more
deyntee / wherfor^ it semyth to me best. that every devout creature that
loves to read or here this book: take the parties thereof as it semyth most
comfortable and stirynge to his deuoco^n / Sometime one. and sometime another:
and specially in times of the year. and the festes ordained in holy church as
the matters ben pertynent to hem / And for asmoche as that blessed and worthy
feast of the precious sacrament of Jhu^s body. in the which he is every day
bodily present with us to our most comfort that we may have in earth. is
the end and conclusyon of all other Festes of him gracyously and resonably
ordained by holy church: as it was said before Thefor^ with the grace of the
holy ghost and of him of whom that feast is. we shall speak somewhat more to
comfort of hem that truly bileuen. and to confusion of all falls lollardes and
heretykes / Ame^ / Blessed be the name of our lord Jhu^ and his mother mary now
and ever without end /

AMEN
Explicit Sp^lm vite Cristi A short treatyce of the highest and most worthy
sacrament of cristis blessid body: and the merueyles thereof /


MEmoriam fecit mirabiliu^ suorum misericors and miserator dn^s esca^ dedit
timentibus se These words of dauyd in the sa^^ter. said in prophecye so^ge
time before thyncarnaco^n of our lord Jhu^ specially of the worshipful
sacrament of his precious bodi haven sentence and under stondynge in englyssh
tongue / Our lord merciful and mercy yeuer has maade a mind of his
merueyles. and that he has give mete to hem yt dreden him / This mete is that
precious ghostly mete of ye blessed body of our lord in the sacrament of
thaulter yt he of his souerayn mercy yeuyth every day in form of bread to all
tho yt truly dreden him as her lord god. by the which dread they kepen hem
from dedely sin. and mekely standen in steadfast believe of holy church / And
this ghostly mete he yeuyth and has made thereby a special mind of his
merueiles / That is to say as the prestes rehercen in the canon of the mass
in mind of his merueyles and blessed passo^n and of his merueylous
Resurrecco^n. and of his glorious Ascenco^n / And generally in mind of all the
merueylous works and deeds of him in his blessed life here in this world: the
which is treated in all this book before written / For to begin ^yrst at his
merueyllous Incarnaco^n: so how express mind thereof is this mete that he
yeuyth to us in the sacrament of the altar For therein is he verily: and in
that self body that was so merueylously conceived by the holy ghost above kind
/ And also so merueylously borne of his blessed mother mary without sorrow or
weme of sin / And so forth of all the merueyllous works and deeds of him:
in to this ghostly mete / we have that special mind that none may be more.
and that we have of none other / For all other things passed that we have
mind of / we conceive in spirit and in heart: so that thereby we have not the
bodily presence of hem / But in this ghostly mete and sacramentale
co^memoraco^n of our lord Jhesu he is verily and bodily present with us under
another form But sothly in his own proper substance very god and man / For
what time he should stye up in to heaven: he said to his discyples and his
folowers in thise words / Lo I am with you all the days in to the worlds
end. co^fortyng hem by this benign promise. that he should dwell with hem not
only by ghostly presence of his godhede. but also by the bodyly presence of
his manhede that he yeuyth to us in this foresaid mete of his flessh and blood
in mind of his merneyles generally as it is said: but most special in mind
of yt blessed passion that he suffered for us. For what time he should pass out
of this world to the fader the night before his passo^n at that worthy supper
with his discyples as it is said before: he made and ordained this sovereign
and most worshypfull sacrament of his flessh and blood / yeuynge his body to
mete: and his blood in to drink for a special mind of his passion and death
/ For thus he said to his appostles in that first making of this heelfull
sacrament / This does ye in my mind. So that the sovereign and most worthy
mind of his passion and passing love to us should be evermore this high
worshipful sacrament. this is that precious ghostly mete: and special mind
of our lord Jhu^ in the which is had al ghostly likynge and the savor and
taast of all swetnesse / And also this is that sweet memoryale. where through we
ben wythdrawe and kept fro wickedness: and comforted and strengthed in
goodness. and protyten every day in encreace of virtues and of grace in
sothfastnesse / This is that hic yefte and most noble memoryale yt owes
worthily to be prynted ever in our mind: and to be bestly kept in the inward
affecco^n of the heart in contynuel mind of him that yeuith us this sweet
memoryale and precious yeft / For whose yett is ofttyme seen hins mind is
likyngly prynted in the heart / Thus our lord Jhu^s of his great mercy has made
a likynge mind of his merueyles yeuyng this mete specially to he that drede^
him / And here we shall understand that in ii. manners men dreden god. and
thereafter he yeuith this mete diversely to hem For some dreden god. as
servants dreden her lord leuyng and eschewynge to syn^e only for dread of
pain. and to thise manner of men: if they ben out of dedely syn^e and in grace:
our lord yeuith this foresaid mete as to her ghostly sustenau^ce. so that by
the virtue thereof. they ben sustained in life of soul: and kept fro everlasting
death / But other ben that dreden god as true chyldern dreden to offend their
fader for the love of him / And to thise manner of men our lord god yeuith his
precious mete. not only to her ghostly sustenau^ce: but also to her souerayn
likynge and wonderful comfort in soul / And of this manner of dreding folk
spekith of the same prophet david in thise words / O lord god: how much is
the manyfolde plentee of thy swetnesse: the which thou have hid to hem that
dreden the / But they that dreden not god have neither ghostly sustenau^ce nor
heelful likynge of this precious and noble mete. but through her own
wickedness and vndisposyng in soul taken it and eten it to her ghostly death
and everlasting dampnaco^n / And that be^ two manner of people / One is of hem
that dreden not to receive this holiest sacrament in dedely syn^e. or else by
defaulte of dread contynuen in her sin / For as the wise man says / The
dread of god casts out syn^e. and therefore who so contynueth in dedely
syn^e. it is an open preyf that he dredeth not god / And then^e he is unable to
receive. and heelfully ete this worthy sacrament / Another manner of people that
lacken the dread of god ben heretics. the which in defawte of buxome dread to
god and holy church: presu^ptuously leuynge upon her bodily wits and kyndly
reison / Leave not that holy doctors have taut and holy church determined* of
this blessed sacrament but falsely trowen and obstynatly saye^ that it is bread
in his kind as it was before the consecraco^n / So that the substance of bread
is not turned in to y^ substance of goddis body: but abides still bread as it
was before. by cause that it semyth so to all her bodily wits / The which
error and heresy. and al other of this holiest sacrament without doubt
sprynge^ of ghostly pride and presu^pcyon of kyndly wytt in defawte and lack
of lowly dread / For either such men leven that god may worche al those
merueyles above the comin course of kind: as holy church techyth in this holy
sacrament or naught / And if they leave not that he may. then^e dreden they
him naught as god almighty: and so ben they wors men than jews or sarrasynes
For both believe that god is almighty / And on that other side if they sayen
and leven that god: for he is almighty may work those merueyles. but they leave
not that he does so. for as much as her kind by reason tellyth hem the
contrary. then^e dreden they not for to ayensay the sovereign goodness and l^ne
of god to ma^kinde as in y^ party that holy church techith and by leuyth of
this holy sacrament: and in that they preuen he^self great foles / For though
it were so y^ it were in doubt whether the techyng and believe y^ holy church
has of this holy sacrament were sooth or naught / Or else also set caas that
it were so the: yet the syker pa^te were to believe as holy church techyth with
a buxome dread / For in that we leven our kindly reason and ben obeysau^t to god
and holy church: as himself byddeth us* And also we wythdrawe not in our
believe of the might of god. nor of his love and souerayn goodness to us: but
rather maken it more / if it so were y^ it were not soth as we byleuen: and
that were little peril. or rather none: but mede in us in all parts for our
good will to god and holy church / And also in that believe there is no peril
of ydolatrye as the false heretykes sayen. that we honouren and maken bread our
god / For we sayen and bileue^ that in that holy sacrament bread is turned in
to goddis body by virtue of crystis words / And so we all honouren not bread
but god and his blessed body in form of bread That is to say in that likeness
of bread that we seen by true believe in soul with our ghostly eyes / Thus we
having love and dread of god: and stondynge steadfastly in the believe y^ holy
church has taught us specially of this holiest sacrament we shall consider
and Inwardly behold the kyndlynge and nourisshyng of our love to our lord
Jhu^ that yeuyth us of his hye grace this precious mete of his blessed body The
merueyles that he makyth and worchyth therein specially in two maneres / That is
to say in one manner every day pryuely: where of we have knowing oonly by
believe within forth. and also in a another manner sometime openly: whereof we have
knowing by true telling of miracles showed without forth* Towchyng the first
manner of merueyles. it is a full great merueyle. that by virtue of crystis
words: bread is turned into goddis body: and wine in to his blood / And to
strength us in bileue of this merueyle when shall have in mind that he with the
self might of his word made all the world of naught: and of the rybbe of
adam made eve in flesh and blood: and turned the wife of loath in to an image
of salt. and moses yerde in to a serpent / And wells and waters of egypt
turned in to blood / wherefore sythen god almighty wrought all these merueyles:
and many moo above the reason of man and the common course of kind / why may he
not also by the self might torn bread in to his body / There is no reason to
preue the contrary / But if we would say that god were not almighty* That god
forbede /.

Also it is a great merueyle that the self body of our lord Jhesu that sittyth
in heaven upon the faders right half is verily and holy in all the places of
the world / where this sacrament is treated soothly contained in that
sacrament in the self flesh and blood that was conceived of the holy ghost.
and borne of the blessed virgyn mary: and henge upon the cross for our
sauacyon / This may not be comprehended fully by man^es reason: but only
stondeth in believe / Nevertheless there is a manner like merueyle in kind that a
word spoken of one man to much people. is holy in him that spekith it. and
also in all those that here it: ben they never so many / It is also a great
merueylle that so great a body of our lord Jhu^ is fully and holy
comprehended in so lityl a quantyte of thoost: and therewith also if that oost
be departed in to many small pieces it is as fully in every part as it was in
all the hole / Herto also is a manner of likeness that we seen in kind. how
thymage of a man^es great face and of a great body is seen in a litil myrrour /
And if it be broken and departed. yet in every part it semyth all the hole
image. and not in party: after the parts of y^ glass so broken / Many other
wonderful merueyles our lord god almighty werchith in this precious sacrament
of his endless mercy to our ghostly comfort and hele of soul. the which we
may not co^prehende by kyndly reason: and our bodily wy^t but only by true
bileue and faith / And therefore it is great folly and ghostly peril to seche
curyously in ymagynaco^n of reason y^ merueyles of this worthy sacrament / But
it is most siker to a simple soul namly. and suffyseth to sauaco^n / Touthyng
the foresaid merueyles and all other of this blessed sacrament to think and
feel in this matere / Thus have holy doctors taught and holy church
determined / And therefore I trow and fully bileue that it is in sothnesse.
though my kyndely reason againsay it / For as saint gregory says / That faith
has no (...)*
merit: to the which man^es reason yeuith experyence Touching the second
manner of merueylles and miracles showed without forth by virtue of this holy
sacrament: and in this holy sacrament: as we find wryten*For three skylles ou^

shewyth in diverse manners those merueylles and miracles in this precious
sacrament. that is to say Sometime to comfort hem that been in true believe of
this blessed sacrament. and to kyndle her love thereby the more fervently to
god. and to worshippyng of that sacrament / Also sometime by special grace for
to co^uerte and ^orne to true believe hem that been out there of / And also
sometime to open preif of the* great virtues there of in delyuerau^ce of pains:
and saving fro bodily myscheyf and ghostly / And each of these three I shall
tell shortly some merueyles and miracles that I find written. the which ben of

but he be wors than a Jewe or a paynym* Towchynge the first. that is to say:
how our lord sometime ^* causa

hem. that been in true bileue: and to kyndle her hertes in to the more fervent
love of god / We fynden wryte^ N(...)
in the lift of the holy Confessor saint Edward the king whose body lies in
shryne at westmynstre: the which life as for the more auctoryte in sothnesse:
wrote the worthy clerk and holy abbot of Ryuaus Alred. thus saying touching
this matere / In that worthy monestery of saint Peter called westmestre. and at
the altar dedifyed there in the worship of the holy trinyte. as the foresaid
holy king edward herd mass on a day with the worthy earl called Leueryche.
the which with his noble wife Godyue the countess was founder of many worthy
houses of religion / what time it came to y^ co^secraco^n. and goddis body in
form of bread was hold up to the peples sight bytwyx the prestes hondes after
the use of holy church He that is fairest in shape before al men^es sons our
lord Jhu^s christ apered bodily in that oost to both her sy^ghtes: liftynge up
his right hand: making a cross toward the king blessing / And then^e the
king with lowtyng of his head honoring the presence of goddis magestec:
mekely with all the body did reverence to so worthy a blessinge / But the
earl that saw the self syghte not knowing what was in y^ kings heart / And
after desiryng that the king might be partyner of so great and worthy a
syghte. began to goo toward the king fro his place. that was perauenture on
side byneth as longed to his astate / But the king vnderstondin ge what was
the^es intent. said to him in this manner / Stand Leueryche. stand / For that
thou see I see also / After this they both of so Joyefull a sight ghostly
comforted and turned all in devout prayers and sweet weeping teeres weren made
ghostly dronken of the ple^te of goddis house. and fed with the river of his
sovereign Joye and ghostly liking / And after the end of the mass: they that
were so blisfully refeted with ghostly mete comyned togider of the foresaid
heavenly siyght with sweet teres and inward sighynges* often times brekinge her
speches / And then^e said saint edward / My dear Leueryche I pray the and
charge the by that high magestee that we have so gracyonsly seen that never
while we live this thing be brought fourth in to the common knowing: leest we
thereby fall in to vaynglory and pride through thoppinyon of the common people to
our ghostly death / Or leest the envy of mysbyleuynge men let and destroy
true believe to the words there of / wherefore after the foresaid earl was goon
fro the kings court by the Juspyraco^n of the holy ghost: as it is to believe
/ He was taught so that he kept the bidding and the heste of his lord /
And yet therwyth that high virtuous miracle should not be fully unknown to
them that were after to come / For after he came to the monastery of wircestre.
and there in confession to a Religyous man he told the foresaid miracle
chargyng him in manner as the king had charged him: and prayed him that he
would write the preuytee of so worthy a visyon. and put in such a place that
it might be unknown to hem that then^e were living: and that it might be
known to hem that were to coming / And so did that holy man after the earls
prayer / He wrote all thorder and manner of the foresaid visyon in a bylle. and
laid it among relyques closed in a cofre: the which cofre long time after ye
kings death with out man^es hand through the might of god as it is to bileue
was found open / And then the brethren of that place besily searching the
relics fou^den the foresaid bylle: and radde it / And after for asmoche as
they would not that so great a tresour and worthy miracle should be hid.
they publysshed it in the eeres of the people openly / And so as the king
would. it was for the time hid / But after by the ordinance of god
publysshed and known: to that end that the kings meekness thereby as hid
should be preued / And netheles therwyth by open knowing of y^ great miracle y^
faith of true byleuinge men should be co^fermed and stre^ghthid to worship of
our lord Jhu^: that of his special grace werchith such miracles and merueyles
in that blessed sacrament of his precious body. in special comfortynge of true
lyuers / and more fervent stiringe to his love / AMEN

Also according to the self purpoos I find writing in the long life of
saint Hughe bishop of Lyncolne: and first monk of thorder of charterhous and
pryour of wytham The which life wrote a chappellayn of his: and monk of the
self order that herd and saw that he wrote / And among other in this manner
sentence saying / It befell upon a satirdaye the foresaid bishop saint Hughe
dwelling at a maneer of his called Bukedene. as he sange a mass of our lady
after his common custom in that day. there herd his mass with other a
devout clerk: that was sent to him by specyal reuelaco^n of god / whereof
there is written a fair process touching another matere the which we passen
over here / And as to our purpoos what time it was com^ to the sactynge as the
bishop held up goddys body in form of biede. there appeared to the syghte of
the foresaid clerk bitwyx the prestes holy hondes our lord god bodily in
lykenes of a passing fair lityll child / Of the which syghte he that saw it
Inwardly co^puncte: as no wonder was: and hiely styred in to fervent deuoco^n
co^tynued all the time of y^ mass in sweet teres and devout prayers. till it
came to yt place where thoost should be lift up above the chalyce. and be
departed in three. at the which time he efte saw the self lykenes the foresaid
Jhu^ goddis sone of heaven of fryng himself in sa crefise to the fader for
man^es hele and saua co^n / After the mass was full ended: the self clerk
speaking with the holy bisshap in preuyte. told him first the reuelacy on
before named / And after y^ fair vision of goddis bodi here declared and
therwyth at th^de with shedyng teres in this manner co^cludynge: said thus / I
saw my holy fader with mine un worthy eyes yt blessed sight: the which it is
no doubt but yt ye see^ it also much and more clerly: for longer and nere and
mot^ worthily / And therwyth both the bishop and he with sweet teeres
comynyng ghostly a great while togider after at the counseyle of the bishop.
and biddyng for to keep the foresaid vysion preuy. the clerk became a religyous
man. and after holy living here went to bliss everlasting / Amen /

Touching the second cause of miracles and merueyles showed ii. causa mitac^o
rum
in this blessed sacrament of goddis body. that is to say: for to co^uerte hem
that been of mysbileue in to y^ true believe / Fuste we read in the life of saint
gregory the pope and worthy doctor in this manner sentence / There was a
matrone of Rome: the which every sunday offered to saint gregory certain loves
of bread. whereof was made goddis body / And upon a sunday when saint gregory
would have comuned the foresaid woman with one of hem that was co^se^rate and
made god dis body. saying after the common use of holy church in these words /
The body of our lord Jhu^ christ keep the in to everlasting life / She brake
out in to a dissolute laughter / and then^e saint gregory wythdrewe the
sacrament fro her: and kept it to the end of the mass / And after before the
people he asked the matrone why she lough / And then^e she said. by cause that
thou call goddis body the bread that I have made with my hondes / And then^e
saint gregory fell down in to his prayers to god. for the mysbyleue of the
woman / And after that he rose up: he fond the sacrament turned in to lyknes
of a finger in flesh and blood. where through the woman was fro her misbyleue
turned in to the true / And so after with the self sacrament by prayer of
saint gregory turned in to the lykenes of bread: as it was before: she was
comuned. and more styfly set in true bileue of this blessed sacrament / And
also other thru^ her to the worshipp^ of the high gracyous auctour and wercher
hereof our lord Jhesus christ / Amen

To this self purpoos according also I find written in the foresaid life of
saint hughe: that upon a time as saint hughe going through france was Inned
for the time in a town that was called Joye: there came to him the parysshe
preeste of the town. the which was an old man. and a reverent in syight. and
wonder lene for great penance doing for his sins as it was supposed / And
whereof it folowith after in process: the which I take as in short words to
our purpose. and y^ self priest told of himself in this manner / When I was
young he said I was made priest but neither years ne manners according to that
worthy degree through temptaco^n and stirynge of the fend I fell in to a great
dedely syn^e / In the which sin I continued without contryco^n and
confession: that is horrible to here / So as I was pollute in body and soul.
and ghostly blind and seek in the faith: I used boldly to sing my mass and
dradde not to treat and receive that worthy sacrament of crystis precious
flesh and blood / And upon a day as I was at my mass in time of the
consecraco^n fell to my myude y^ great horrible syn^e the which I had solonge
time continued in / And among other wretched thoughts of my blind heart. I
thought in this manner / Lord whether that precious body in flesh and blood
of my lord Jhu^ that is called the bryghtnes of everlasting life. and ghostly
myrrour of the godhe de without we^me is now made. treated: and received verily
of me so foul and abhomynable syn^er / And so having such unthrifty
thoughts. when it came to the time of the fraccy on: and as the use is. I had
broken thoost in two / Anon fresshe blood ran out thereof. and that part
that I held in my hand was turned in to flesh. and over al wete with the
reed blood / And therwyth I seenge this. was al astonyed and abashed. and well
nyghe out of my wytt: and so as for lost the counsel of all reason / All
that I held in my hand I let fall down in to the chalyce / There was then^e
to see and yet now is a wonderful miracle. that is to say. wine turned openly
to man's syghte in to blood. and bread in to flesh. declarynge expressly
the form and the sothnes of that blessed sacrament / Ferdermore he said when I
saw this manner of lykenes abide still without any tornynge or chau^gynge. I
durst no more touch hem. but pryuely I hiled the chalyce with the patene: and
the paten with the corporace / And after the mass was done and the people away
passed. I set the chalyce with the holy relyques yt yet in to this day ben
contained therein: in a convenient place beside thaulter with due reverence to
be kept / After this I went to the pope: and made to him my confession with
sothfast telling of all the caas beforsayd. and of all my sins / And after
he had Joined me penance and due satysfaccyon He assoylled me. and let me goo
/ And so after the miracle publysshed and known. there camen fro diverse
countrees much folk to see those precious relyques with great reverence
magnyfienge our lord. that alone werchith such hye miracles and merueyles /
And then^e at the end the foresaid priest prayed the clerks of saint Hughe: to
the which he told all the forsayde tale: that they would also tell it to him.
so y^ he might be helped as anenst god thorugh his holy prayers / And when
they had so done supposing that he would with a great desire have goon for to
see the foresaid memeyles / He ansuerde in this manner sentence: that is worthily
to be noted. to wchynge the faith of this holy sacrament / well he said in the
name of on re lord / Let hem have to hemself the tokens of her mysbyle ue?
what is that to us of thise things? whether we that every day seen with the
trueste Inner syghte of our soul all holy and fully this heavenly sacrifyce
haven in merueyle the pertyculers images of this yeft of god / As who says
nay. but let him goo see the lityll small porco^ns thereof with his bodily eye
that sees not all the hole with his Inner ghostly eye And when he had thus
said yeuynge his blessyng to the priest at his going / After he reprehe^ded his
meyne of her curyosyte: and not only stabled hem in bileue. but also declared
openly. y^ those things that our faith techith us. should be vnderston de and
hold more certainly of true bileuyng me^: than tho things that this erthly
light by reason shows to bodily sight. Thus our lord by special grace by
open miracles and merueyles showed in this blessed sacrament drawith some folk
out of her mysbyleue: and stablysshed hem and strengthed in true by leave: as
it is now showed in u. manners / Touching y^ third cause of shewenge miracles
and merueyles in this blessed sacrament. that is to open preyf of the great
virtues thereof in delyuerau^ce of pains and saving fro bodily myscheyf and
ghostly / Saint gregory tellyth in his dyalogues: and also in an omely upon
that gospel of luke Si quis venit ad me / How there was not long before his
time a man taken by enmyes. and ladde in t^ far country. and there laid in
prison and set in hard bo^des long time: and after many days his wife y^ he:
de no more of him. and supposed that he had be deed: let sing every weke ones a
mass: and offered the sacred oost for his soule*And also often as the masses were
so done for his soul. so of times his feters and bonds were loosed in that
prison / For long time after wha^ he was delyuerde out of prison. and come
home in to his own country: he told his wif with great merueyle. how y^
certain days every weke his bonds were losed and vndone*And his wif besily
accou^tyng and notyng the self days. understood well and had knowledge that as
often she let offer the sacred oost for him. so often was he loosed and his
bo^des undone And then^e the foresaid saint gregory concludes in this sentence
/ wherefore dear bredern hereof in certain consyderaco^n takyth and gadreth in to
your mind of the sacred oost that is offered of us. how much it may in
ourself unbind ghostly the bond of our heart. fythen that it offered of one
man was of so great virtue that it might loose in a another the bo^de of his
body wherefore much owyth every priest to love for to sing his mass oftymes:
and for to dyspose him thereto by clean life and contrycion and confession / To
this self purpoos also the foresaid saint Gregory tellyth in this book called
Dyalo gus. how upon a time when a bishop was in the sea toward rome. there
cam^ upon him so great a tempest y^ he was in despeyre ever tescape and come to
land / The shipma^ y^ was in a lityll bote following the ship after that the
rope where that the boat was bounden to the ship by vyolence of y^ tempest
was broken suddenly with the self bote. he was ca^t so a monge the wawes of the sea that the bishop saw no more of him / And afterward when the bisshoppis
ship af^ many perils was driven to land in a certain isle: the third day he
went by the sea side besyly lokyng wheder he might have seen of the boat or of
the shypman beforsayd / But wha^ he miyght not see of he^ in any party of y^
see: supposing y^ the shipman was drowned and deed: having great sorrow for him:
he ^ete sing a mass and offer y^ helful sacrifyce of goddis body for
thassoyling of his soul / And aftwarde in the said ship restored he took the sea toward ytalye / And when he came to y^ haven of rome: there suddenly he
found a live the foresaid ship man that he wend had be deed / whereof glad
and Joyeful he asked him in what manner he might live so many days in so great
peril of y^ see / And he ansuerd and told how of times in the flodes of y^
tempest he was cast up and down now above y^ bote full of water and now under /
And at last what for traueile and what for fasting when he was so overcome and
nere deed. that he wist neither forsooth wheder he slepte or woke. suddenly him
thought that one apered to him in mids of the sea. and^ya ue him bread to
ete. the which also sone as he had eten: he took strength: and soon after in
a ship that came thereby he was taken and brought to land / And when the
bishop had asked of him. and understood the day in the which he had received
the said brede*and was reuygored / Then^e knew he well that it was the self
day in the which he let the priest sing for him: and offer the sacred oost
in the foresaid isle for his soul / Thus shewyth our lord Jhu^s christ openly
by miracles and merueyles the souerayn virtue of his blessed sacrament: and
that not only in helping and saving of men alive as it is now herb
for^sayd. but also that is more to charge in loosynge and vnbindynge of souls
hethen passed out of the fire of purgatory. as the self saint gregory tellyth
in the forsaide book plainly of a monk that for the syn^e of proper^e was in
the pain of purgatory / And after the sacred oost was offered for him xxx.
days he was releaced and delyuerde out of pain / And also how a another soul
was delyuerde out of pain by virtue of that blessed sacrament offered for it all the days of a weke / And here may we see openly preyf of y^ passing profit
and virtue of special masses done and songen both for the quycke and the deed
/ For as the self saint gregory sayith: the holy sacred oost syngulerly and
souerainly helpyth to un bind our souls fro sin. and most pryncipally
pleiseth y^ king of heaven: and makyth him soft to us when he comith to deem us:
so that it be offered with teeres of compu^cco^n and clennes of heart / For he
that in himself rysynge fro death shall never deye. yet by this blessed oost for
us suffers in his mystetery / For as often as we offer to him thoost of his
passion. so often we maken new to us his passo^n to our vndindyng fro sin /
Thus our lord Jhu^s full of mercy. and shedyng to us soueraynly his endless
mercy in making and yeuynge of this most precious ghostly mete of his blessed
body werchith in diverse manners as it is said his merueyles and miracles openly
showed in this excellent sacrament / And yet contynueth pryuely and wonderfully
ther^ he vouchesauf in hem that by true bileue and love dreden him / But this
love and dread wanten many great clerks. the which leven somoche upon her
own kindly reason. and the prynciples of the phylosophie. that is man's
wisdom grounded oonly in kyndly reason of man. that they wol not leave the true
faith taught by holy church of this blessed sacrament / And therefore they
feel not the sothfast comfortable effect of the merueyles and miracles before
said / Neither open ne preuy to wchynge this holy sacrament / wherefore much
folk ben deceived in that party that rather yeue^ credence to that a great
clerk techith acordyng to kyndly reason than to that holy church techith
hereof only in believe above reason / For there may no man sooner err in
bileue of the sacraments of holy church. and specially in this high
wonderful sacrament of christ precious flessh and blood. than may great
clerks. but they have grace of true mekenes and love dread: whereby they leave
their own wytt and kindly reason. and submytte he^ lowely by true believe and
doctrine of holy church / That grace grant us god specially of his great
mercy in these last days that been as it semyth nyghe to the coming of
antcryst and his discyples: the which shall pryncipally found to destroy the
true faith of this blessed sacrament. and that by great clergy of man^es
cu^nynge. and by merueyles and miracles werchynge. as saint gregory in his
morales upon that word of christ in the gospel speaking of antecryst and his
discyples says in this sentence / There shall rise up falls christian men and
falls prophets. and they shall show and work great signs and wonders: In
somoche that they that been goddis chosen folk: if it may be shall be brought
in to error / Sothly says saint gregory / Now our true marters*werchen
merueylles what time they suffren torments and pains / But then^e that is to
say at the coming of antcryst his discyples when they yeuen torments and
pains. they shall also therewith werche miracles / Let us then think and
have in mind what temptacyons of man's thought that shall be: when the meke
marter submyttith his body to torments / And nevertheless the tormentour before
his eyes werchyth miracles? whoos virtue shall then^e be so sadly grounded in
byseue that he ne shall be meued in his thought what time he sees that he y^
tormenteth also therwyth by signs and merueylles openly shyneth / For then^e
shall antecryst be high in worship by merueilous werchyng. and hard and sharp
by cruelte of tormentyng. Thise ben the words of that holy doctor saint
gregori and many moo spekynges of the wonderful might of antcryst and his
discyples: and the great temptaco^n that shall be that time to christian men /
And it is lykely by reason that as the most comfort of our christian believe
stant in this most excellent sacrament of crystes body / So antcryst and his
discyples shall princypally work in to destrucco^n / First of the true bylene
of this blessed sacrament in the foresaid two manners That is to say by clergy
and euydence of worlds cu^nyng acordyng to naturell reason / And by many
merueyles and miracles werchyng in false decepco^n / And of the first manner
werchyng we have seen in our days. how the discyples of Antecryst that been
called lollardes have made much descencyon and diuysion in holy church / And
put mani men in to error of this blessed sacrament by the false doctrine of her
master / The which through his great clergy and cu^nynge of phylosophye was
deceived in that he yaue more cred^ce to the doctrine of Arystotle that stant
only in naturell reyson of man thanne he did to the doctrine of holy church
and the true doctors thereof touching this precious sacrament / For Arystotle
techyth as kyndely reason accords that the accydentes of bread or wine: That
is to say: the color: the savor: and so forth of other. may not be but in
substance of bread or wine after her kind / But the doctrine of holy church
is y^ in this blessed sacrament by specyal miracle of god above kind y^
color: the sauonr. and other accydentes of bread and wine ben there without
her kyndly sub^ecte. that is to say without the substance of bread* and wine
that was before the consecraco^n / And for asmoche as this doctrine of holy
church is against the prynciples of philosophye: that is naturell science.
therefore the master of lollardes reproved it and scorned: and so he errith
himself and made many other to err touching the bileue of this holiest
sacrament: the which yeuen more credence to him for the opinyon of his great
clergy than to the true doctrine of holy church / And thus yet in our days
has antcryst wrought in the first manner before said by this false master of
lollardes: and many other of his discyples in to destrucco^n of true christian
believe touching this blessed sacrament of cristis body and many other points
ayenste holy church without the second manner. that is to say werchynge of
merueylles and miracles / For and antecriste had had in hem so great power
that they had with her reasons also wroughte merueylles and miracles. it had be
lykely that holy church and true believe specially of this blessed sacrament in
great party had be destroyed for the unstableness of the most party of the
people: notwithstondyng the great merueyles and miracles many and often that our
lord has showed herbefore in this holy sacrament as it is said. to strength
us and stable us in the true believe that holy church has taught us to^* of /
In the which believe by reason we should be so sadly (...) that after the
sentence of the apostle poul: though there came down an angel from heaven: and
taught the contrary. we should not give credence to him: but hold him as
cursed / But sooth it is: that there may no true angel teache the contrary of
the bileue of holy church / And therefore he that so does. is an angel of
sathanas. and not of god / As ben all the false lollardes: the which have
neither true dread nor perfyte love of our lord Jhu^ / And therefore they feel
not the ghostly swetnes of this heavenly mete of his precious body. ne the
likynge mind of his merueylles showed in that blessed sacrament* But we that
thorugh grace stonden in true believe as holy church has taught us in this
sovereign holiest sacrament with goostly liking of soul / Have we not oonly
in mind the great merueylles and mighty miracles written and preched of that
holy Sacrament in diverse manners showed: as it is beforsayd / But also consider
we how that our lord Jhu^s of his vnspeable goodness showed to mankind he
yeueth him self to us every day bodily in that precious sacrament as in a
conclusion. and most special mind of all his blessed life to sovereign
comfort and help of our wretchid life. the which is full of temptaco^ns. and
ouersette with many enmyes Wherefore it is spedfull to us contynuelly to cry
after help of the sonerayne virtue of this blessed sacrament by the words
that holy church syngeth in the ympne of this sacrament thus / O thou helful
oost that openest the door of heaven the bataylles of our enmyes oppressen and
ouerseten us / wherefore give us strength of wythstondynge. and bring us thy
help to her ouercomyng / Also to wythstondynge of temptaco^ns. and ouercomyng
of vices: to getynge of virtues: and encreace of fervent affecco^ns of our
lord Jhu^ as for a full end of all his blessed life before written /

Enprynted by wynkin the worth

Here folowyth a short devout prayer to Jhu^ christ and his body in the
sacrament of the altar: the which owes to be said in presence of that holy
sacrament at the mass with inward deuoco^n /
