Names of the Aduenturors, and Sums adventured in that Action. By his
Majesty's Counseil for VIRGINIA. 22. Iunij. 1620.

SIGILVM REGIS MAGNAE BRITANIAE FRANCIAE ET HIBERNIAE



LONDON: Printed by T. S. 1620.

By his Majesty's Counseil for VIRGINIA.
AFter the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Almighty God to suffer the
great Enemy of all good Actions and his Instruments, to encounter and
interrupt, to oppress and keep weak, this noble Action for the planting of
Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It having pleased him
now contrarily of his especial great grace, so to bless and prosper our late
careful endeauours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for
supplying of the present defects, wherewith the Colony was kept down, that it
has as it were on a sudden grown to double that height, strength, plenty,
and prosperity, which it had in former times attained. We have thought it now
the peculiar duty of our place, accordingly as it has been also ordered by a
general Court, to Summon as it were by a kind of loving invitement, the whole
Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and
perfecting of this happy work, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great
expenses and travails.

And first to remove that unworthy aspersion, wherewith ill disposed minds,
guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, have both by Letters from thence, and by
rumors here at home, sought unjustly to stain and blemish that Country, as
being barren and unprofitable; We have thought it necessary for the full
satisfaction of all, to make it publicly known, that by diligent examination
we have assuredly found, those Letters and Rumors to have been false and
malicious; procured by practice, and suborned to evil purposes: And contrarily
disaduowed by the testimony upon Oath of the chief Inhabitants of all the
Colony; by whom we are ascertained, that the Country is rich, spacious, and
well watered; temperate as for the Climate; very healthful after men are a
little accustomed to it; abounding with all Gods natural blessings: The Land
replenished with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Dear, and
other Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Rivers (whereof many are exceeding
fair and nauigable,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts desirable; both
Water and Land yielding Foul in very great store and variety: In Sum, a
Country, too good for ill people; and we hope reserved by the providence of
God, for such as shall apply themselves faithfully to his service, and be a
strength and honor to our King and Nation. But touching those Commodities for
which that Country is proper, and which have been lately set up for the
Aduenturors benefit: we refer you to a true note of them, lately delivered in
a great and general Court, and hereunto annexed for your better information.
By which and other approved informations brought unto us, We rest in great
assurance, that this Country, as it is seated near the midst of the world,
between the extreamities of heat and cold; So it also participateth of the
benefits of both, and is capable (being assisted with skill and industry) of
the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furs, Cauiary,
and Cordage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be had
in Virginia, and the parts adjoining, with ease and plenty. The Masts,
Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tar, the Potashes and Sope-ashes, the
Hemp and Flax, (being the materials of Linen,) which now we fetch from
Norway, Denmark, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and
great perfection. The Iron, which has so wasted our English Woods, that it
self in short time must decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia
(where wasting of Woods is a benefit) for all good conditions answerable to the
best in the world. The Wines, Fruit, and Salt of France* and Spain; The
Silks of Persia and Italy, will be found also in Virginia, and in no kind of
worth inferior. We omit here a multitude of other natural Commodities,
dispeirsed up and down the diverse parts of the world: of Woods, Roots, and
Berries, for excellent Dies: Of Plants and other Drugges, for Physical
service: Of sweet Woods, Oils, and Gummes, for pleasure and other use: Of
Cotten-wooll, and Sugarcanes, all which may there also be had in abundance,
with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corn,
Cattle, and Fish, which are the substance of the food of man. The Grains of
our Country do prosper there very well: Of Wheat they have great plenty: But
their Maze, being the natural Grain of that Country, does far exceed in
pleasantness, strength and fertility. The Cattle which we have transported
thither, (being now grown near to five hundred,) become much bigger of Body,
then the breed from which they came: The Horses also more beautiful, and
fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertility of that Soil, that
the Does of their Dear yield two Fawnes at a birth, and sometimes three. The
Fishings at Cape Codd, being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be
equal to those of Newfound Land, and in goodness and greatness much
superior. To conclude, it is a Country, which nothing but ignorance can
think ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt mind and ill purpose can
defame.

Now touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country, We have
thought it not unfit thus much briefly to declare. There have been sent
thither this last year, and are now presently in going, twelve hundred persons
and upward, as particularly appears in the note above specified: and there
are near one thousand more remaining of those that were gone before. The men
lately sent, have been most of them choice men, borne and bred up to labor
and industry. Out of Devonshire, about an hundred men, brought up to Husbandry.
Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, above one hundred and ten; and out of
Sussex about forty; all framed to Iron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of
diverse Shires of the Realm. There have been also sundry persons of good
quality, much commended for sufficiency, industry and honesty, provided and
sent to take charge and government of those people. The care likewise that has
been taken by directions, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce
the people and affairs in Virginia into a regular course, has been such and
so great, that the Colony begins now to have the face and fashion of an
orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The people are all
divided into several Buroughs; each man having the shares of Land due to him
set out, to hold and enjoy to him and his Heirs. The public Lands for the
Company here, for the Governor there, for the College, and for each particular
Borough, for the Ministers also, and for diverse other necessary Officers, are
likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diverse
private Societies, are settled in their Seats, being allotted to their content,
and each in convenient distance. The rigor of Martial Law, wherewith before
they were governed, is reduced within the limits prescribed by his Majesty: and
the laudable form of Justice and government used in this Realm, established,
and followed as near as may be. The Governor is so restrained to a Counseil
joined with him, that he can do wrong to no man, who may not have speedy
remedy. Each Borough, and each particular Plantation, partly has, partly is
bound to have in short time, a sufficient Minister: for whom maintenance is
ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a year value. Which orderly proceeding
there, by direction from hence, has caused the Colony now at length to settle
themselves in a firm resolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to
building of Houses, each for his own private; and the Generality to the
rearing of public Guest houses, for intertaining of new men upon their first
arrival. They fall to set up their Ploughes; to the Planting of Vineyards; to
the pursuing of the Staple Commodities furnished and commended from hence. In
sum they are now so full of alacrity and cheerfulness, that in a late
general Assembly, they have in the name of the Colony presented their greatest
possible thanks to the Company, for the care that has been taken for the
settling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which has
been had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and
affairs of the Company, to an orderly course of good government and Justice.
Wherein to begin with the fountain thereof, his Majesty's authority and
pleasure, there has been a Collection made of all the branches of the same,
dispersed in his Letters Patents, now three times renewed: as also out of other
Instructions proceeding from his Majesty. Out of both which, together with
such other Orders as (authorized by his Majesty) the Company themselves have
thought necessary to make, has been compiled a Book of standing Orders and
Constitutions, approved by the general Consent of all the Company: whereby
both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, have their business carried
regularly, industriously, and justly, every man knowing both his right and
duty, to their general great content, and the great advancement of the
Action. And whereas the Colony likewise have been often Suitors in effect, to
reduce into a compendious and orderly form in writing, the Laws of England
proper for the use of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the
nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important
circumstances should necessarily require: a course is likewise taken for the
effecting of this work; yet so as to submit it first to his Majesty's view and
approbation; it being not fit that his Majesty's Subjects should be governed by
any other Laws, then such as receive the influence of their life from him.

And now to come to that which concerns the Aduenturors in particular, by
whose charges, care, and labor (next unto his Majesty's especial grace,) this
famous Plantation has not only been undertaken, but through so many
difficulties vpheld and continued: we should be very greatly injurious to
them, if we should not acquaint them with this seasonable time, for the reaping
of that benefit and reward which is due unto them. We therefore let them
know, that in this last year now ended, there have been granted by the
Company under their legal Seal, eleven several Patents for particular
Plantations; and more are in hand to be passed this next Quarter-Court. It is
not improbable, that upon each of these Patents, diverse hundreds of persons
will soon Plant in Virginia: there having been already transported upon the
first, above three hundred men. These and other like Planters, having priority
of time, will have priority also in choice of the Seat of their Plantations.
Seeing therefore the only matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a
fair proportion of Land to them and their heirs; namely of one hundred acres
for every share of twelve pounds and ten shillings, upon a first division; and
as much more upon a second, the first being peopled; with fifty acres for
every person, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their own charges they
shall transport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of June 1625. if he
continue there three years, either at one or several times, or dye after he
is shipped for that voyage: It stands them upon, who are not willing to be
the last in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the least in setting forth to
the choice and peopling of their Land. Wherein what favor or assistance may by
us be given them, they shall be well assured of it, in equal proportion with
our selves, as their charges and long expectance have well deserved. And to the
end that not only the Aduenturors now living, but the Heirs also of the
deceased, may take certain notice of the several proportions of Land, which
ratably to their Adventures in money are due and belonging to them: And likewise
that Posterity may truly know, by whose charges this Plantation (next under
his Majesty) has been happily founded, maintained, and continued: We have
here, according to an Order of Court, set down in an Alphabeticall Table the
names of all the Aduenturors, with all their several sums adventured. Wherein
if by error, or other mis-accident, there have wrong been done to any man; if
within one twelve month after the date hereof, he give notice and make proof
thereof to the Companies Auditors; he shall be set right, and the Table
reformed: there being not any thing more dear unto us, then to do Right unto
them with all Justifiable *courtesy, who have been beginners and continuers of
this glorious work, tending so much to the propagating of the true service of
Almighty God, to the adding of greatness and honor to our King, and to the
benefit of our whole Nation in disburdening their multitude. 22. Iunij. 1620.

Commodities.
The Commodities which these people are directed principally to apply, (next to
their own necessary maintenance) are these ensuing:
IRON: for which are sent 150. Persons, to set up three Iron works; proof
having been made of the extraordinary goodness of that Iron.

CORDAGE: for which (besides Hemp) direction is given for the planting of
Silkegrasse, (naturally growing in those parts) in great abundance: which is
approved to make the best Cordage and Linen in the world. Of this, every
house-holder is bound to set 100 Plants: and the Governor himself has set
five thousand.

POTASHES and SOPE-ASHES, PITCH and TAR: for the making whereof the
Polackers are returned to their works.

TIMBER of all sorts, with Masts, Planks and Boords for provision of Shipping,
etc, there being not so good Timber for all uses in any one known Country
whatsoever. And for the ease and increase of diverse of these works, provision
is sent of men and materials, for the setting up of sundry Sawing Milles.

SILK: for which that Country is exceeding proper, having innumerable store
of Mu bery Trees of the best, and some silkewormes naturally found upon them,
producing excellent Silk: some whereof is to be seen. For the setting up of
which Commodity, his Majesty has been graciously pleased now the second time
(the former having miscarried) to bestow upon the Company plenty of
Silke-wormes seed of his own store, being the best.

VINES: whereof the Country yields naturally great store, and of sundry
sorts: which by culture will be brought to excellent perfection. For the
effecting whereof, diverse skillful Vignerons are sent, with store also from
hence of Vine plants of the best sort.

SALT: which works having been lately suffered to decay, are now ordered to be
set up in so great plenty, as not only to serve the Colony for the present;
but as is hoped in short time also the great Fishings on those Coast.

For the following, working, and perfecting of these Commodities, all
provisions necessary for the present are sent in good abundance. As likewise
the People that go, are plentifully furnished with apparel, bedding, victual
for six months: Implements both for House and ^abour, Armor, weapons,
tools, and sundry other necessaries. And a supply of Armor, Powder, and many
necessary provisions is made for those of the Colonie which were there before;
yet without any prejudice to the former Magazin.

Gifts.
There have been given to the Colonie this year by devout Persons, these
gifts ensuing.
Two Persons unknown, have given fair Plate, and other rich Ornaments for two
Communion Tables; whereof one for the College, and the other for the Church of
Mistrisse Mary Robinsons founding: who in the former year by her Will, gave
200. pounds toward the founding of a Church in Virginia.

Another unknown person, (together with a godly letter) has lately sent to
the Treasurer 550. pounds in gold, for the bringing up of children of the
Infidels: first in the Knowledge of God and true Religion; and next, in fit
Trades whereby honestly to live.

Master Nicolas Ferrar deceased, has by his Will given 300. pounds to the
College in Virginia, to be paid, when there shall be ten of the Infidels
children placed in it. And in the mean time four and twenty pounds by year,
to be distributed unto three discreet and Godly men in the Colony, which shall
honestly bring up three of the Infidels children in Christian Religion, and
some good course to live by.

An unnamed person sent to the Treasurer the sum of ten pounds, for advancing
of the Plantation.

Patents.
There have been Patents granted this year for particular Plantations, as
here ensues:
To the Society of Southampton hundred. To Master Heath, Recorder of London. To
Master Wincopp. To Master Tracie. To Doctor Bohun. To Master Pierce. To Master
Delbridge. To Master Pointz. To Master Barkley. To Captain Bargraue. To
Captain Ward.
Who have undertaken to transport to Virginia great multitudes of people, with
store of Cattle.

It is to be known, that touching the College for the Infidels Children, it
has been thought more expedient to begin first with the planting and
peopling of the Lands: (which has been done this year:) and afterward to
proceed to the erecting of the Fabric, which is to be performed out of the
revenues of the Lands.

FINIS.
A DECLARATION of the Supplies intended to be sent to VIRGINIA, in this year
1620. By his Majesty's Counseil for Virginia. 18. Iulij 1620.
WHereas the Right Honorable, Henry Earl of Southampton, with the advice and
consent of the Counseil and Company for Virginia, has resolved and concluded
to employ all good means in this present year, 1620. not only for the
advancing of the Plantation in strength and multitude of good people, but also
for the enriching thereof with store of cattle of diverse sorts, and by setting
up or increasing such Staple Commodities, as being proper for that Country,
may be also of most necessary use for this Realm, and redound in fine to the
greatest benefit of both Aduenturors and Planters, and lastly for the
establishing there of such good Government (originally derived from the Kings
most excellent Majesty, the first and chief Founder of this glorious work)
as whereby the people there, divided in soil only, but still participating in
the religious and happy government of this their native Country, may continue
always as one and the same people with us, according to the most Princely
direction of his Majesty: We have thought it very necessary for the seconding
and forwarding of those so noble Designs, not only to publish them to the
Aduenturors in general, thereby to inuit them to concur with us in the
same, but also to set down such particularities requisite, as whereby the
preparations of all sorts needful, may upon this timely warning, both better
and more seasonably be made and compassed.

First therefore we have thought fit, to make it publicly known, that besides
the great store of particular Plantations now in providing, and like very
shortly in large proportion to augment, the Company have resolved in a late
general Court, by the blessing of God, to set out this year at the public
charge, and to send to Virginia, eight hundred choice persons, of the qualities
ensuing: First, four hundred, to be Tenants of the general land of the
Company, to make up the number of those Tenants full 500. whereof 200. to be
placed at Elizabeth City, with the Companies Deputy: 100. at Henrico, 100. at
Charles City: And at James City there are a hundred and more already.
Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to such Officers, etc. as the Court
already has, or shall shortly appoint: viz. 10. for the Deputy of the
College, 40. for the Companies Deputy, 20. for the Secretary 10. more (besides
50. already sent) for the Ministers: and 20. for the Physician: their care for
the ease and prosperity of the Colonie, being such and so great, as to cause
them to endowe those Offices and places, (as they have formerly done others,)
with fair possessions, furnished with Tenants and other fit provisions: that
the people may have the benefit by them, and yet be freed from the burden.
Thirdly one hundred young Maids to make wives for these Tenants as the former.
90. which have been lately sent. Fourthly, one hundred Boys, to be apprentizes
likewise to the public Tenants. Fifthly, one hundred servants to be disposed
amongst the old Planters, which they greatly desire, and have offered to defray
their charges with very great thanks. And although by reason of the
preparations already made, the difficulty may be well conceived to be in great
part overcome, and the profit much more near, and more easy to come by; yet
the Company wholly affecting the peoples prosperity, have determined to deal
both as favorably in the Contracts, and as bountifully in all sorts of
furniture and provisions with the Tenants which shall now go, as they have done
with those, which have been formerly sent. Which conditions it has been
thought fit here to reinsert and publish.

EVery man transported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants
to the Common land of the Company, or to the public land, shall be freely
landed there at the charge of the Company: And shall be furnished with
provisions of victual for one whole year next after his arrival, as also of
Cattle: And with apparel, weapons, tools and implements, both of house and
labor, for his necessary use. He shall enjoy the ratable moytie of all the
profits that shall be raised of the land on which he shall be Planted, as well
Corn and Cattle, as other commodities whatsoever: the other half being due to
the Owners of the Land.

He shall be tied by Covenant, to continue upon that Land for the Term of
seven years: which being expired, it shall be in his choice, whither to
continue there* or to remove to any other place, at his own will and pleasure.

Of these persons, one hundred and twenty (such as are to be Tenants) are to be
shipped here for Virginia, by the midst of August now at hand: and the rest in
January and February ensuing.

The next preparations are of Cattle of diverse sorts: whereof there are
intended in the next Spring to be sent these ensuing. One hundred Kine, for
this addition of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to remain in a
perpetual stock upon the Companies Land, to be sent to new Planters, as has
bin formerly ordered. Four hundred Goats, twenty Mares, fourscore Asses to be
procured from France: The care of providing which, is commended to diverse
select persons by parts, and the whole to the oversight of the general
Committies.

The ^ast provisions appointed to be made, are for the setting up, or
increasing of diverse principal^ Commodities. For Silk, there is provision to
be made, of great store of Silke-worme-seede about Michaelmas next: as also of
men skillful in the ordering as well of the Worms, as of their Silk, which
are to be sent away in a Pinnace, in October betimes. For Hemp and Flax,
Potashes and Sope-ashes, Pitch and Tar, there is a Treaty already on foot,
for procuring of men skillful in those Trades from the Eastern parts: besides
the Polakers yet remaining in Virginia. For Wines, it is also ordered, that men
skillful be procured in the planting and dressing of Vines, out of France and
from the Rhene: and from thence also and other parts to procure Plants of the
best kinds. For Oil, besides great quantity to be made out of the Walnuts,
growing naturally in Virginia in great abundance, Oliue-Plants are to be
provided from Marseilles and Ligorno. For Fish, which on those Coasts are taken
in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New Foundland, there is care
and a course taken, to preserve the Companies Liberties, and to set up the
Fishings in better sort then heretofore. For Salt, order is given for the
making of it in abundance, and after the manner of those hotter Climates, which
may prove a great help to increase the Plantation. For Iron, there is
sufficient done already.

And for Sawing-Milles, besides those already gone this Spring, there are
lately come from Hamborough, diverse Workmen very skillful, to be sent in the
next ship. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is
a Pinnace already, and other Boats shall be provided, to remain there at the
Deputies command, to traffic and trade for the Company and their Tenants
under his charge.

These large supplies of men, Cattle, and Commodities, as they tend to the
accomplishing of this great work of the Plantation: so can they not be
themselves effected, without large provision of money, being the sinews and
moving Instruments in these great Actions.

To which end we desire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be assisting to
us, by such means as they shall please: especially that the remain of all
promised Adventures, may in Michaelmas Term next be paid in without fail,
which we trust will now be done cheerfully on all parts, the inuitements of
this year being well*considered: that as the presenting of their first
payments, has been the beginning, so the performance of the later, may be the
perfecting and finishing of this work, so glorious before God and man.

And here by the way, for the clearing of some scruples and errors through
mistaking of our writings lately published, we are to advertise, that the
Alphabet of Adventurers and sums adventured, neither then conveniently could,
nor was intended to extend any further, then to such sums as have been paid
in to the Treasurors of the Company, and to Sir Baptist Hicks, by special
order of Court. And whereas diverse other bills of Adventure, have bin heretofore
delivered, partly upon personal adventure, and no money paid in, partly upon
gift from the Company, in regard of deserts, partly for sums paid to other
men, whose Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treasurors) and partly
for goods which never came within the Treasurors Accounts, but of other
inferior Officers, into whose hands they were delivered (for which
notwithstanding bills of Adventure have been delivered, mentioning as if it were
money paid to the Treasuror: If the Aduenturors shall be pleased within the
time prefixed, to put in their just claims, by these or any other ways
whatsoever, there shall be right done to them, and a new alphabeticall book
shall be published, embracing exactly all kind of Aduenturors, with their
several sums either really adventured, or otherwise accepted, allowed or
bestowed be it upon what cause, or in what kind soever.

Now if the Auenturors be thus requested with much greater reason are all
Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and make
perfect their several Accounts, and to pay in those monyes, which shall
remain due to the Company: that so all parts concurring with their duties and
endeavors, the work may proceed with general joy.

Lastly, as heretofore, so we now also declare, that the persons to be admitted
to go, as the Companies* Tenants, and with the foresaid conditions, shall be
no other then good men, that is to say of good Trades, of skill in husbandry,
or industrious laborers; and such of those as shall be commended for their
honest conversation: which persons repairing to the City of London in the
beginning of August, and in the middle of January, next, according to the
several numbers at those times to be sent, shall from thence-forward be
entertained, at the Companies charges, till such time as they be shipped for
Virginia: there being especial care likewise taken, for the providing of good
Commanders and Directors of their works.
