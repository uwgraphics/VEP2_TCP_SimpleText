PROPOSITIONS Made by Monsieur Vander Hurst at the Assembly of the General
States of the United Provinces, upon the 13. of January, 1608.
RIght honorable,
May it please you to be advertised, that forasmuch as that the high and
mighty Princes, the Archduke Albertus and the Infanta Isabella, have long
since had and conceived great disliking of and concerning the bloody
Netherland wars, as also of the great hurt, hinderance and utter destruction,
which the Inhabitants thereof on both sides do hereby endure and daily fall
into; and had rather see and behold the Netherlands (being brought to a firm
and most affured Peace) to reobtaine their ancient and pristinate flourishing
estate; have not refrained both now and heretofore to signify unto your
Honors, not only by themselves but by their messengers, what means they
thought to be most fit to work the same: as in May last they sent me hither
only to that end and purpose. But for that your Honors (in regard of the
departure of Prince Maurice, with some of your Honors Deputies from the Hague,
about your martial affairs) could not resolve thereon, their Highn^s^^ (...)
bear arms, and till this time to make and maintain war, have not wished
nor craved more of God almighty (for the benefit, welfare, and security of
the said Netherlands, together with the good Inhabitants thereof) than to
attain unto a godly, honorable, and an assured end of their said wars, as
they also with all their hearts at this present still pray, desire and beseech
God continually for the same. But for that by the said Instruction dated in May
aforesaid (whereunto other Acts and Commissions have a reference) it does
clearly and evidently appear, that their said Highness do as yet continue in
their ungrounded pretense, that a certain right and title does yet belong and
appertain unto them, to and in the said Netherlands; whereas to the contrary
the said States do evidently, plainly, and without contradiction maintain and
hold, That their said Highness neither can nor may by any means (otherwise
than by force and power of war) pretend any right or title unto the United
Provinces whatsoever: And that to the contrary, the said General States of the
United Provinces, upon good and lawful causes, have always esteemed, and with
undoubted right understand, (for the union of the united Netherland Provinces)
That all the Provinces, Towns, and Places, which for the maintenance of the
said union, have by force, and otherwise secretly by practice been taken and
surprised, with violation of the solemn decree, are decreed and may be holden
(by weighty and mighty reasons) for a free State. Which decree for the space
of seven and twenty years hitherwards, by diverse public Acts and Decrees,
and by the mightiest Kings and Potentates of Europe has been confirmed, as
also the said States both for themselves and for all their deceased Adherents,
(and as yet many thousands Well-willers to the freedom of the Netherlands,
sighing under their Highness gonernment, desire to see a good end) by the
special grace of God, the aid and assistance of the aforesaid Kings and
Potentates, together with the uttermost means of the said Provinces, Quarters,
Towns and Inhabitants, by a commendable right, have hitherto maintained, and
are resolved to maintain and defend the same unto the uttermost: and to that
end the said States upon diverse the like offers and propositions (motioned not
only by their said Highness and by the Emperors Majesty) have declared, that
it is neither godly, honorable, nor assured for them, to deal with those who
against the aforesaid Decree hold and maintain, and do insist and allege to
have right and title unto the said united Provinces. In the which Decree the
said States persisting, do hold and account themselves to be blameless and
innocent before God almighty and all the world, and specially the Netherlands,
of all the miseries, hurts, and troubles happened unto the said Netherlands and
their neighbors, by means of the said unlawful pretenses, and from the
proceedings, which they the said States for the maintenance of their said
right, have been constrained to take in hand.

Given in the Hague the seven and twentieth of January, 1608.
A DECLARATION made and sent by the States General unto all the Provinces and
Towns under their government, touching the Peace to be made.
RIght Honorable and Worshipful:
for that the common cause of the united Provinces, by Gods special grace and
favor, is brought so far, and to that end, that the Archdukes Highness, in
March last past by three several motions in writing, have thought good to
entreat and desire us, as with States of free Countries and Provinces, whereunto
their Highness make no manner of pretense or title, to hearken unto a treaty
of peace, or truce, and abstinance from wars for many years, with
prouisionall exception from besieging and surprising of Towns, and Forts,
inuading or taking in of Provinces and Quarters; as also of the making of new
Forts, for the time of eight months next ensuing; that in the mean time, we
may with them sit and determine upon the said Treaty, and to make an end of
the said Treaty before the first of September next coming: We with the advice
of his Eccellencie, and the Counsel of Estate, having thought and esteemed it
good, to accept and allow of the said motion and prouisionall exceptions, and
also to proceed to a further Treaty, and thereof to give our final resolution
before the first of September next ensuing, and herewith send letters of
commission to appear, according to the contents of these presents. And
although we are well assured that your Honors and Worships are sufficiently
informed and certified of this motion and business in hand, yet we thought it
good to advertise you thereof, and of our intents and purposes, to advertise
and communicate the same, unto and with the Kings of Great Britane, France, and
Denmark, as also with the Electors, and other Towns of the Empire, with whom
these United Provinces are in league and amity; that having understood their
good intents, aduices, and counsels concerning these United Provinces, we may
proceed to a farther and riper consideration thereof here in the said
Provinces, and such as shall be found meetest and best for the honor of God,
the furthering of Christian reformed religion, and the best service, and most
assurance of the same, and of the United Netherlands, and the Inhabitants
thereof. And for that before all things, it is convenient and necessary that
God Almighty should with all our hearts be praised and thanked for his many
and special graces, showed and bestowed toward and upon these Countries,
during these wars: and specially, that it has pleased him to move the
hearts of the Archdukes, to make and motion the said offers and propositions,
as also to pray that it would please him, graciously to bless the said
Treaty; that it may tend to the honor of his holy name, the maintenance and
spreading abroad of his holy word; and of the Christian reformed religion,
together with the welfare and securing of the United Netherlands, and of the
Inhabitants thereof: We have thought it good, to ordain and appoint, a
general Fast, and day of prayer to be made and held in the United Provinces,
upon the 8. of May next ensuing: And therefore our desire is, that your Honors
shall cause the said Fasting and Prayer day to be published and ploclaimed in all the places of the Provinces of Holland and West Freeseland, according to the
accustomed manner therein used: and to command that the same may be holden and
celebrated accordingly, wherein you shall do an acceptable piece of service,
both unto the Country and us. Wherewith, Right Honorable and Worshipful, and
our special good friends, we commit you to the protection of the Almighty.

Dated etc. and under written, John van olden Barnevelt.

And lower there stood your special good friends; the States General of the
United Provinces of the Netherlands,
and somewhat lower, by the ordinance of the said States.

THE FINAL ANSWER made by the said General States of the United Provinces,
unto the Commssioners for the King of Spain and the Archduke, assembled in the
Hague, concerning Peace to be made.
THe States general of the United Netherlands, having heard the report of
their Deputies appointed to deal in the Treaty of Peace, touching that which
was declared in the conference holden upon the 20. of this month, by the
Deputies for the High and Mighty King of Spain, etc. and for Albertus and
Isabella Clara ingenia, Archdukes of Austria, etc. for the final charge and
commission given them by the said King and the Archdukes touching the general
points of the said Treaty, upon advice of the Right Honorable William Earl of
Nassaue, etc. and the Counsel of Estate of the said United Provinces, for
resolution thereupon, have declared, and by these presents do declare, that
the hurtful fruits and issues of diverse fore-passed Trearies, during the
Netherland wars, made with the King of Spain last deceased, have so much
moved the States General, for the space of 25. years together, both upon the
offers made in the behalf of the said King, his Governors and Successors, as
also at the motions and solicitations of the Emperors Majesty, together with
the greatest and chiefest Kings and Potentates of Europe, that they could not
be persuaded to enter into, or hearken unto any new treaty of Peace, but have
always excused themselves therein, fearing the like effects; so that also upon
the same Propositions made unto them to the like end, in the month of January
1607, in the behalf of the high and mighty Princes the Archdukes: they did
roundly and by answer in writing declare, as also unto the like proposition not
long before propounded by the Emperors majesty; the said States made answer,
that they thought it neither godly, honorable, nor secure, for them to enter
into any treaty of Peace, with those, that contrary to their Decree,
maintained and established, would seem to oppose, or to justify themselves to
have and pretend any title unto the said Country: and that withal, they did
persist, with protestation before God almighty, all the world, and specially
the Netherlands, to be blameless and innocent of and concerning all the
miseries, hurts and troubles which the Netherlands, and their neighbors,
together with the inhabitants thereof, by means of the aforesaid unlawful
pretenses, have suffered and endured, and yet were likely to suffer and endure.
Which answer being returned unto the said Archdukes, not long after several
letters and writings subscribed with their hands, were by the said Archdukes
sent unto the said General estates, whereby they signified unto them, that
they were content to deal with them as with States of a free Country, (and
for the which they so held and accounted both them and it, and whereunto they
made not any pretense) touching a perpetual Peace, or a truce and abstinance
from wars, for many years. And in the first of the aforesaid Acts it was
said, that by the making of a Truce every man should hold that which he held
and possessed; and by the making of a Peace, that which should be agreed upon;
as also that the United Provinces should desist and abstain from trafficking
unto the East and West Indies, etc. Whereunto the said States roundly made
refusal; which the said Archdukes perceiving, made answer, that they were
content that every man both by Truce and Peace should possess and enjoy that
which he held, and claimed to be his own, unless that by exchange of any
places by common consent, they could otherwise agree: and at the same time also
the clause of defisting from trafficking and sailing unto the East and West
Indies, was omitted, according to their Act to that end made, bearing date the
13. of March, in the aforesaid year. Upon the which Act the 12. of April,
after certain points touching the nomination of their respectiues Committies,
being agreed upon between the Deputies for the said Archdukes, and the
General States, upon the four and twentieth of the same month, by a formal
instrument under written by their said Highness, and sealed with their great
seals, and with their accustomed signatures and Paraphrases: and an other
writing likewise sealed, Paraphrased, and underwritten, in the behalf of the
General States, in quality as States of free Countries and Provinces;
whereunto the Archdukes did not pretend any right or title, it was agreed, and
by their said Highness promised, to hold and observe, and to cause to be
holden and observed the aforesaid declaration made unto the said General
States, and to make restitution, and cause the same to be made for all direct
and indirect courses taken and used contrary unto the same, and besides those
letters of confirmation, to cause the like declaration to be sent from the
King of Spain (for as much as it concerned him) unto the said General States,
within three months then next ensuing, with all general and particular
renouncings, and assurances thereunto belonging. And thereupon the Truce for
abstaining from all acts of hostility being also agreed upon: There were three
acts of confirmation and consent sent into Holland from the said king; two of
them bearing date the last of January; and one the eighteenth of March, in the
year aforesaid: the last of them containing these words in effect. And for
that the aforesaid Archduke our brother, has promised to make the said
Treaty, and thereupon to deliver unto the said States, our letters of
ratification, and the like declaration, with all general and particular
renuntiations, and promises, as the cause requires: We upon ripe deliberation
and advice, upon our certain knowledge, and absolute kingly power, for the
holding and performing of the said promise, and the assuring of the principal
Treaty of Peace, or of a long Truce to be made: do by these presents make the
like declaration unto the States aforesaid, that our brother has made, whereof
mention is before made, forasmuch as the same concerns us: And specially we
declare, that we are well pleased and contented, that in our own name, and in
our behalf, a Treaty shall be made with the said States, in quality, and as
esteeming and holding them for free Countries, Provinces and States; whereunto
we make no pretense of Sovereignty: and also have approved, confirmed, and
ratified, and by these presents do approve, confirm, and ratify, all and
every one of the points, comprehended and contained in the said Treaty: and
promise by the word of a king to hold and observe them all, and to cause them
to be held and observed as wholly and particularly, as if we had at the
beginning thereof declared, consented and promised the same, and as if they had
been proceeded in, and concluded by our consent and authority, and will not
do, nor cause any thing to be done contrary unto the same: and also will
promise to recompense and make amends for all direct or indirect courses used
and taken contrary unto the same, in such manner that all the aforesaid points
shall be truly observed, holden, and fulfilled unto and with the said States:
Whereunto we bind our selves by the word of a Prince, with all the general
and particular renuntiations and obligations thereunto requisite and needful.
We also promise, that as soon as the Treaty of Peace, or long Truce, shall be
concluded and agreed upon, that we will cause all dispatches necessary to be
made for the fulfilling and execution of that which shall be capitulated and
agreed upon, in good manner and form, as they ought to be: so that in all
things, and thorowout all the foresaid United Provinces, whole and full
satisfaction shall be made touching the aforesaid promise and confirmation, and
with express reiection of all that which may be contrary or against the said
confirmation: and withal, expressly declaring, that the General States, as
States of free Countries, whereunto the King and the Archdukes make no
pretense of Sovereignty, by the grace of God Almighty, and the aid of their
allies (nominating the Kings of Great Britain, France, Denmark, and other
Potentates) which in the said Provinces shall and may take order and maintain
all causes that concern the welfare of the State and government (amongst the
which, before all, the point of Religion is to be maintained, and the same
expressly given in charge unto the Archdukes Deputies) concerning the said
Provinces, and the good Inhabitants thereof: so that in the chief Treaty,
nothing shall or may be propounded against the same; (unless that men should
seek to prevent and contrary the aforesaid formal and solemn promise.)
Lastly it was concluded by the General States, that the Deputies of the said
King and the Archdukes, might come unto the Hague, there to entreat and agree
upon the said Treaty, with full information, charge, and authority to show
their meanings plainly and sincerely therein: as also to understand the States
intent and meaning, that so they might make a short and brief resolution
therein.

The said Deputies being come unto the Hague, and having entered into Treaty
with the Deputies of the said States, at the beginning there was a new clear
and express promise and ratification made, not only to the said States, but
also unto all the particular Provinces, and Lordships, thereunto depending, as
also unto the Quarters, Lordships, Towns and Places of other Provinces holden
by the said States, according to the foresaid promises, dated the 24. of
April, both in the name of the King of Spain, and the Archdukes, being
procured and to be procured from them, and all and every one of their heirs
and successors, in their Kingdoms, Countries and States, decreeing and
declaring that they pretend not any title in or unto the aforesaid United
Provinces, Lordships, Lands, Towns and Places, as then holden and possessed by
the said States, and that they held and accounted them for free States,
Provinces, Lordships, Countries, Towns and Places, with promise upon their
words and honors, and upon the words of Princes, not to do any thing contrary
unto the same, nor permit it to be done, (no not in using the names, titles, or
arms of the said Provinces, or otherwise) directly or indirectly in any wise
whatsoever: as also that from thenceforth, at all times and for ever, there
should be a good, firm, indissoluble Peace between the aforesaid high and
mighty King and the Archdukes their children, and successors, and the
aforesaid States, in the quality aforesaid, for all the Kingdoms, Lands,
Lordships, Towns and Places which the aforesaid Kings, Archdukes, and States
held and possessed, with their respective subjects and inhabitants, which
reside therein at this time, or that hereafter shall dwell therein, without
exception of any man whatsoever. Also, that the said King and Archdukes, and
the said States, in quality aforesaid, together with their respective subjects
and inhabitants should from thencefoorth live in good friendship, without using
any more hostility, with forgetting of all forepassed causes and actions. But
in the process of the Treaty, the Deputies in the behalf of the said King
and Archdukes, sought to abridge and diminish the aforesaid acknowledged
freedom of the United Provinces, in the principallest point thereof, and to
make it of no effect, as amongst the rest, expressly in the general traffic
and navigations, with the consequences thereof, wherein the chief and
principal welfare of the aforesaid Provinces consists. Also, in the
pretenses (only to the evident and manifest overthrow of the United Provinces,
without cause or reason) of dismembring some of the united Provinces of that
which without denial (according to the agreement made) belonged unto them.
Also in the disputation touching the freedom and sovereignty of certain
Towns, held and possessed by the States, as also of the Villages appointed for
places of receipt and accounts, in demanding of certain lands, which by former
Princes had been conquered, and otherwise, coucrtly speaking of the point-of
Religion, without making any free or open proposi^ion thereof: and being urged
to speak their minds freely and fully therein, sometime they said, that they
would not do any thing contrary to the freedom and sovereignty (to the
dislike or coffeehouse of the States of the united Provinces) touching the
point of Religion; and yet at another time, they said they must consult with
them of Spain touching the point of Religion, and that touching the same, and
concerning the point of general traffic and navigations, some of them must
expressly go into Spain. And although that the aforesaid States General,
perceiving the said proceedings might well have broken up the said Treaty,
notwithstanding considering the great importance thereof, and desiring for
their parts before God, and before all Kings, Potentates, Princes, and
Commonwealths of Europe, and specially before the Commons of the united
Provinces, to make known, that they with all their hearts, and uprightly
desire to alter and change the long, hurtful, and bloody wars of the
Netherlands, into a godly, honorable, and an assured peace, for the comfort and
vnburthening not only of the Inhabitants of the Netherlands, but also of the
neighbor countries and kingdoms; thought good by the advice and good counsel
of the Ambassadors of the Kings of Great Britain, France, Denmark, etc. and
of the Evangelical Electors and Princes of Germany (who at their earnest
requests, were sent unto the Netherlands, to aid and assist them in the said
Treaty and business of so great importance) that one of the Deputies for the
King and the Archdukes, should go into Spain, to understand the Kings
absolute intent and meaning, notwithstanding it was expressly signified and
declared by the States, that they would not consent unto the like deliberation,
but only for that time, and that the said Deputy should expressly return
again with the said resolution, within two months then next after ensuing.
And to that end the Truce for the months of April and May was continued and
prolonged. After that by means of the long staying of him that was sent into
Spain, before the end of the month of May, the aforesaid Truce by common
consent, was prolonged until the last of December last past: but the States
once again and plainly told the Deputies for the said King and the Archdukes,
that their meaning was, within two months at the farthest, after the month of
May, they would have a final end and breaking up of the said Treaty.
Whereupon as in the beginning of the month of June, and after from time to
time, diverse letters and aduices were brought and came from several Countries
and Kingdoms, that the said king of Spain and the Spanish Counsel did not
proceed truly and uprightly in the said Treaty, but by delays and all the
means they could, sought to undermine the State of the united Provinces:
Presently thereupon, as about the middle of June, the said Deputies for the
King and the Archdukes were advertised by the General States of the said
advice sent them, with earnest request by them made, to understand and know
their uttermost intent and meaning: and withal it being told them, that
notwithstanding the Truce was prolonged and continued for the whole year, yet
it was the States meaning, not to suffer the delay of the end of the said
Treaty any longer than until the last of July, and that they might then
presently break up and depart, if their intents were not to bring the Treaty
to any good end: Whereupon the said Deputies made answer, That they held those
aduices to be wholly untrue, and that they were otherwise fully certified and
assured, after that some few days, before the expiration of the month of
July, certifying the States, that they had advice out of Spain, that the
Commissarie general was commanded to attend at the Court upon the fifteenth of
July, to receive his dispatch, and that without doubt he would be there very
shortly: whereupon the matter being considered of, until the twentieth of
August, and in the mean time news of the continuance of the King of Spaines
intent coming from all places, it was thought good the same day to have
another conference with the said Deputies, to understand their uttermost
authority and meanings: who at the same time declared, That the King of
Spaines and the Archdukes resolute intents were, that the agreement made
should be observed and kept, and that the united Provinces by their said
acknowledgement and agreement should be free and sovereign countries, without
pretense of any right, vassallage, or other souereignty to be sought or
pretended by them therein or thereunto, upon condition that in regard thereof,
the Romish Catholic religion should be reestablished in the said Provinces;
and that the subjects and inhabitants of the said Provinces should presently
and from that time forth leave off and desist from trade, traffike, and
navigations into India; declaring also, that they still persisted in the
difficulties touching the raising of conuoyes, the dismembring of the Dukedom
of Gelder, touching all the high quarter thereof, the holding of the places
upon and being on the other side of the Reyn, as also upon the borders of the
Empire, which without all controversy are neutrall Towns, belonging to the
territories of the Empire, as also touching the pretense of villages and the
head banks or chambers of accounts in Towns belonging unto the States in other
Provinces; also that the Archdukes ought to enjoy the lands belonging unto the
Princes of the houses of Burgondie and Austria, being Lords in the time of the
respective united Provinces. And for that the most part of the aforesaid points
can not be holden nor esteemed, but as pretenses against the decreed,
maintained, confirmed and confessed freedom of the united Provinces, and
consequently, openly repugning against the said Treaty and the confirmation
thereof, and withal against the first Article that is thereby agreed upon:
therefore the States General of the united Provinces understand, that they for
the state of the said countries, and of the good inhabitants thereof, can not
find it good to enter into any further Treaty with the said Deputies, being
heartily sorry, that contrary to their intents, the said Treaty has been so
unprofitably broken off, nevertheless contenting themselves, that they, before
God and all the world, may be held inculpable, that the bloody and long
continued wars of the Netherlands are not changed into a Christian,
honorable, and an assured peace, and a final end made and procured of all the
calamities, miseries, hurts, and hindrances which the said Netherlands, and
their neighbors, together with the good inhabitants of the same have endured,
and are like to endure, by means of the unlawful pretenses of their adverse
parties.

Done in the Hague in full assembly of the General States of the united
Provinces, etc.
