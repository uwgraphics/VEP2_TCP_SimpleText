To the Reader.
FOrasmuch as many writers have diversely written of the account of the time.
Here haste thou (gentle reader) the just number of the years from the
beginning of the world unto this present year of.1547. diligently gathered out
of the Bible.

Here have thou also a certain and sure declaracion that the day of dome is
at hand: not tha^ we will or can declare the very hour, Act. 1.
as Christ says. Acts. 1. But to the intent that we should be ready at all
times as true faithful servants which wait for the coming of their Lord for
he shall not tarry but com^ very shortly. Luke. 12.
Therefore let us watch and pray for we know neither hour nor time.

From the captiuitye of Babylon til the buyldyng again of Jerusalem, are 143.
year. The sixte account.


Iere. 24.25.
The Captivity continued.60, year. 1, Esdra, 1,
In the first year of the reign of king Cyrus were the captives or priso^ers
deliuerd, In the second year of Cirus, 1, Esdra, 2,
me^ began to build the Temple. In the.46. 1, Esdra, 6,
year was the temple co^plete and finished that is in the 6, year of the reign
of king Darius. Nehemias, 2
In the, 20, year of his reign, was Nehemias released, and came for to build
the city.
In the.22. Nehem, 5,
year of Darius was the city finished, so that the number of years of the
buildyng again of the Temple are, 26, which amou^teth together to 143. year.

The, 7, account.
From the buildyng again of Jerusalem til the coming of Christ are.483, year,
which are nombred thus.

It is written in the, 9, Chap of Daniell, of the going for the or procedyng of
the word (that is to say) from the time that Jerusalem shall be buylte again
till the time of the true Messiah and Savior Christ are.67. wekes, Note this
well, Lu, 25
and one weke is counted here for.7. year as it appears, Leuiticus. 25. Thus
make, 67, wekes. 483, year, and so many years is it from the reign of
Darius, til ye 42, year of the reign of Augustus, in which year Christ was
borne. Thus the noumber of the years from the beginnynge of the world till the
birth of Christ are.3, thousand, 974, and little more than half a year,
and from the birth of Christ till this present year of, 47, is clear and
manifest enough. So that from the beginning of the world unto this present
year, are 5521. year and somewhat more then half a year.
Of the end of the world, and of the day of dome or Judgment.

I will not here go about to search out the very hour of the Judgment (for God
(...) in his power, has hydden the same) but manyfestly declare that the day
is even at hand.

ELyas has spoken tha^ the world should stand about 6000. year, which nombre
is divided after thi^ manner 2000 year void wit^out any law.
