To the right excellent and honorable lord Iohu^ Earl of Oxforde / and high
chamberlayne of England Thomas Paynell gretynge.
REdynge of old authors and stories my most honorable lord / I find / that
me^ in time past were of longer life / and of more propsperous health / than
they are now adays. Which thing as hit grieved me / so in manner hit enforced
me / to seek the cause of this sodeyne and strange alteracion. For why / it is
written / Genesis v.
yt Adam lived.9^0. year. The Sibyls of Cumane lived.iii C. wynters:
Nestor.iii.C. wynters: Arganton / king of Tartesses.iii.C. years: and Galen
that famous doctor.C. and.xl. years: but now adays (alas) if a man may aproche
to.xl. or.lx years / me^ repute him happy and fortunate. But yet how many come
thereto? To search and give ye very true reason hereof passes my small capacite:
without I may say hit be / because we fulfill not the commandementes of
almighty god: which to well wyllyng persons are very light / and of no
burden. For our lord says: My yocke is sweet / Mat. x^. Psalm. 127
and my burden light to be borne. Says not the prophet David: that who so
fears god / and walks in his ways and preceptis / shall se his childers
children? And Solomon says: O my children / Prouer. 3.
forget not my precepts and laws: for they shall keep you and prolo^ge your
days and years. And I will (says our lord god by David) lengthen his days.
Psalm. 90.
Than may not this be a reasonable cause of this our so short and wretched
life? Trewely I suppose hit be by our myslyuynge and fylthy sin? which
being so abominable and so horrible / Cap. quia infirmitas de peni et remis.
is at sometime the very cause of corporal infirmite / and of short life. Said
not our lord / the phisician of all phisicians / to the sick man: Now I have
heled the / depart thou from hens: and look thou syn no more / Joan. 5.
lest a worse harm happen upon the? Or whether shall I say / yt hit chances
by our mys diete? and to much surfettynge? Truly the proverb says / that
there dye many mo by surfeit / than by the sword. Ecclesiastici. 37.
According whereto ye wise man says: Surfeit sleeth many a one: and temperance
prolongeth the life. Surfeit and diuersites of meats and drynkes / lettyng and
corruptyng the digestio^ febleth man / and very often causes this shortness of
life. Plin. li. 7
What other thing but mys diete caused Ptolomeus Philadelphus to be so
miserably and peynfully vexed with the gout: and so (as hit is written) that
nothing could relesse his pain / saving death? What caused Antipater / and
that noble man Mecenas / to be contynually vexed with the fever but ill dite?
What other thing infected Aristarcus with the dropsy / but ill diete? Ill diete
(as me thinks) is chiefcause of all dangerous and intolerable diseases: and
of the shortenes of man's life. Than hit must needs follow / that a te^perate
and a moderate diete / prolongeth man's life: and saves him from all such
peynfull diseases. And therefore Asclepiades that noble phisicia^ / v. necessa^
things in regiment of health.
professed There are.v. necessary things to conserve and prolonge man's
prosperity and health: that is abstinence from meat / abstinence from wine /
rubbyng of the body / exercise / and digestio^. O how wholesome is hit than to
use good diete / to live temperatly / to eschew excess of meatis and drinks?
Salerne.
Yea how greatly are we English men bound to the masters of the vnyuersite
of Salerne (Salerne is in the realm of Naples) which vouchesafed in our
behalf to compile thus necessari / and thus wholesome a book? But what avails
hit / to have gold or abundance of riches / if one can not use hit? What
helps costely medicines / if one receive them not? So what profits us a
book / be hit never so expedient and fruitful / if we understand hit not?
Wherefore I / consydryng the fruit yt might come of this book / if hit were
translated in to the english tongue (for why / every man understands not the
latin) I thought hit very expedient at some times / for the welthe of unlearned
persons to busy my self there in: For learned persons / and such as have
great experience / need no instructions to diete them self / nor to conserve
their health. Yet if such other wise and discrete parsones / as is your
lordeshippe / by chance read this book: they may perauenture find that shall
please them: and that besides their own diete and custom of living / shall
be for their corporal welfare and good health. I will not / nor it becomes me
not / to exhort your lordshyp / with let of other your great busynesses / to
read this my power tra^slacion: but if per chance at your leisure ye read hit
/ I humbly desire and pray your good lordeshyppe to read hit with forgyuenes /
and to accept the same as hit is worthy.

Regimen sanitatis.
Anglorum regi scripsit schola tota salerni.
Si vis incolumem / si vis te reddere sanum
Curas toll graves. Irasci creed prophanum.
Parce mero. cenato parum. non sit tibi vanum
Surgere post epulas. somnum fuge meridianum.
Non mictum retine. non comprime fortiter anum.
Hec been si serves / tu longo tempore viues.

THis littell book was compiled at the instance and for the use of the most
noble and victorious king of England / and of France / by the doctors and
physicians of the university of Salerne / to conserve and keep man's body in
good health and prosperity. The auctor in the beginning of this book
teaches.viij. general doctrines / which here after be specified and also
declared. The first doctrine is to eschew and avoid (if we desire corporal
health) greatte charges / thought and care. For thought dries up man's boby /
hurtynge and leaving the spiritis in desolation and comfortles: which so
left / and full of of heuines dries up the bones. In this doctrine be
comprehended melancolynes and heuines / which greatly hurt the body: for by
their operation the body waxes lene and cold / the hatte shrynkethe up / the
wit and understanding comes dulle / the reason troubled / and the memory
utterly marred. Yet nevertheless / it is very expedient for fat and corsye
folk to be some time pensive and heavy / that there by they may moderate the
rank heat of their spiritis / and make their bodies leaner and more sklender.
The second doctrine is / to eschew anger. For anger in like manner dries up
the body / and excessiuely chaffeth and inflameth the members. And to greatte
heat (as writethe Auicen in the first did. and first chap. of the.iij.
doctrine) dries up man's body. Secondly anger hurtethe by the heat and
infla^mation of man's heart / and lettethe also the operations of reason. Some
there be that naturally / or by sickness / or chance of poison / are cold: for
such folk to be angrye is very necessary for their bodily health / that
their natural hete by such means may be stered up / gotten / and kept. The
third doctrine is to eat and drink sobrely: for eating and drynky^ge
excessiuely causes us to be unlusty / drousy / and slothful / hurtynge and
infeblynge the stomach. Many other inconuenientises (as says Auicen in the
chap. of wine and water) grows and chances through excess of meats and
drynkes / as here after shall be declared. The.iiij. doctrine is / to make a
light souper. For to much meat taken at night causes and ingendreth gnawynge
and pain in the bealye / unquietness / let of natural rest / and other grefes
/ which we feel and se by experience: the which here after shall be more
plainly declaredde. The.v. doctrine is to walk after meat. For thereby the
meat disce^deth to the bottum of the stomach / where (as Auicen says)
restethe the virtue of digestion. For the mouth of the stomach desires food
/ and makes digestio^. The.vj. doctrine is to eschew sleep incontinent after
meat / which causes health and auoideth diverse infirmities / as hit is after
showed in these verses: Febris / pigrities etc. The.vij. doctrine is to make
water as often as nedethe: For who that keeps or holdethe his water longer than
nature requirethe / shall avoid it with great pain: and so hit may chance
that death shall follow / as Auicen says in his.xix. did. li.iij. and chaptre
of the difficulte of making of water. Also to keep the dregs and superfluite
of man's food longer tha^ nature requires / ingendreth many inco^uenientises
in the body. For the liver and veins called meseraikes / dry up (for the
most part) the humors of the foresaid superfluite / and so made hard / can not
be avoided: and thus causethe opilations in the guttis and ventosites / and (so
it may chance) impostumes: as after shall be showed. The.viij. doctrine is /
that one doing his easement and auoydyng ordeurs and filth of the body / should
not much enforce and constrayne his fundement: for so doing the emerardes and
fistule shall grieve him / and the fundeme^t many times is mysordred and thrust
out of his propre and natural place. Finally thauctor says / that who so
will observe the forsayde doctrines / shall live long in good health and
prosperity.

Si tibi defitiunt medici / medici tibi fiant
Hec tria. men's leta / requies / moderata dieta.
Here thauctor gyuethe.iij. general remedies to conserve in health al creatures
/ and specially noble men. The first is to live ioyfullye: for joy and myrthe
causes man to be young and lustye. By moderate joy and myrthe youth is
conserved / natural virtue comforted / the wit sharped / and thereby man is
more prompt / quick / and of abilite to do all good and honest operation. Nor
it is not said without a cause that our joy and myrthe must be moderate. For
when it is without measure / it ingendreth death both bodilye and goostlye.
This moderate joy is most convenient for them that have much care and
trouble. Which joy may begotte by the use of delicate meats and drynkes / by
auoidynge of such things as ingendre melancoly. And also (as Auicen says in
his.xj. book and chap. of faylynge of man's heart) by dwelling and accompanyng
among our friends. The.ij. remedy is tra^quillite of mind / of understanding
/ and of thought. For noble men through their great busynes and charges / are
much more grieved and troubled tha^ other mean persons. Great care of mind
and understanding distroyeth the natural rest of man / most expedient for noble
me^ / which most commonly are naturally dry and colerike: for whom rest is
right profitable and convenient. The.iij. remedy is moderate diete / that is to
eat and drink moderately. And after shall be declared what inconveniences
grow through excess of meats and drynkes.

Lumina mane manus surgens gelida lauet vnda.
Hac illac modicum pergat. modicum sua membra
Extendat. crinem pectat. dentes fricet. ista
Confortant cetebrum / confortant cetera membra.
Lote cale / sta / pasce / vel infrigisce minute.
Here are declared.vj. doctrines / which conforte man's brain and the other
members of the body. The first is when we rise in the morning yarly to wasshe
our eyes with clear cold water. The eyes would be washed to cle^se away the
ordure and fylthynes that hang in the bries of them. And Auicen says in
the.xiij. did. of his.iij. book / and chap. of conseruacion of the eyes / that
the souera^st thing to mundifie and cleanse / and to make sharp of sight the
eyes / is to open them / for the eyes.
and so to put and plunge them in clear water. And again he says in the.iij.
did. and chaptre of feeble syghte / that to bathe and plunge the eyes in clear
water / and therein to open them / comforts and concerueth the sight / and
specially of young folk. The reason why the eyes must be cleansed with cold
water / is because every thing must be conserved by that that is like hit.
For Galen in his.iij. book de reg. says / that hot bodies have need of
hot medicines / and cold bodies cold medicines: Considering than that man's
eyes be cold of nature: hit standethe with reason / they should be washed with
cold water and not with hot. The.ij. doctrine is to wash our hands when we
be up in the morning / for they be intrumentes ordained to keep and to
mundifie the members / by the which the superfluites of the brain be expulsed
and avoided / as by the nostrils / the eyes / the ears / and other natural
conditis. And therefore the hands specially ought to be washed with cold
water / for the washing of the hands with hot water engenders worms in
the bealy: and specially to wash them in hot water incontinent after meat /
as Auicen says in the.xvj. did. of his.iij. book / the.v. treatice / the
chap. of worms. For the washing of hands in hot water incontinent after
meat / draws the inward and natural heat of man to the exterior partis /
and so the digestion is vnperfet: the which vnperfet digestion is the
principal cause that worms be engendered. The third doctrine is to rome a
little hither and thither when we are risen from rest / that so the
superfluites of the stomach / guts / and liver (as the gross matter of the
urine) may ye spediler be thruste under. The.iiij. doctrine is competently
after rest to extend and stretche out our hands / fete / and other lymmes /
that the lyfely spiritis may come to the exterior partis of the body / and so
cause the spiritis of the brain to be more quick and subtle. The.v. doctrine
is to comb our heed in the morning / to open the pores of the heed / to
avoid such vapors as yet by sleep were not consumed: and also to quicke^ the
spiritis of the brain. Farther more to comb the heed is very wholesome / and
specially for aged me^. And Auicen says in the.iij. did. of his.iiij. book /
and chap. of feeble sight / that to co^be the heed is wholesome / specially for
old men. Therefore one should daily and often comb his heed. For often combyng
draws up the vapors to the superior partis / and so seperateth them from the
eyes. The.vj. doctrine is to wash and purge the tethe. For the filthynes of
the tethe causethe the brethe to stynke. And of the filthynes of the tethe
growethe certain vapors / that greatly anoye the brain. Farther more the
filthynes of ye tethe myngled with thy meat / causethe the meat to putrify
in the stomach. Auicen in his.vij. did. of the.iij. book and chap. of
co^seruacion of the tethe / for the tethe.
teaches how we may keep the tethe from ache and stynche. That is to wash the
mouth with wine twyse a month: but to make the brethe sweet / it must be
boiled with the root of spurge. Who so ever uses the forsayde decoction and
medicine shall never have the tothe ache. In the last verse are certain
general rules: The first is that after we have washed and bathed our self /
we must keep us warm: For than the cunditis of the body / that is the pores
/ been open: whereby cold will perce in to the body / and ingendre in us
diverse diseases. The.ij. is / that after we have dyned or taken our repast / we
must for a while stand up right / that so the meat may discende to the
bottum of the stomach / and tha^ walk a litel softely: for hasty mouynge
drives natural hete from the interior parts to the outward / and causes il
digestion. The.iij. is / that one of cold complexion should not warm him
self to suddenly / but little and little. for sudden change hurts nature:
as Galen says in the glo^e of this canon: Secundum multum et repent etc. All
strong things and of extreme nature corrupt the body.

Sit breuis aut nullus tibi somnus meridianus.
Febris / pigrities / capitis dolor / atque catarrus
Hec tibi proueniunt ex somno meridiano.
Here are declared.iiij. inco^uenientices engendered by after none sleep. First
the after none sleep causes and inge^dreth fevers by reason of opilatio^s. For
the natural hete and spirit of man by day draws to the outward parts of
the body: and therefore digestion by day is but feeble: But when natural heat
and spiritis of man draw to the inward partis of the body: than through
their motion natural heat is stered up: and therefore the night is the very
season of perfect digestion: and the undigested and raw humors are ye cause
of opilations / which opilations enge^dre fevers / as Auicen says in the.j.
did. li.iiij. and chap. of putrefaction. Secondly after none sleep causethe
man to be slothful in his operations and business / by the reason before said
/ for gross humors and undigested cause man's spiritis slowelye to move the
body: For as a subtle quick spirit causes lyghtnes of body / so a lumpishe
spirit causes a sluggishe boby. cause of heed ache.
Thyrdly / the after none sleep enge^dreth heed ache: For the gross and
undigested meat that remains in the stomach lift up to the brain gross
vapors / which trouble hit. And of very co^sequens / if vapors of gros
mattier be stered up and caused / they must also be gros. For Galen says in
the gloss of this aphorism: qui crescunt etc. that hit must needs follow /
that all things be like those things / of whom they be engendered. The.iiij.
inconvenience is the pose and reume. Reumes be humors that rounne from one
membre to an other / and as they rounne in diverse partis of the body / so they
have diverse names. For when the reume comes to the lights / they be called
catarri: and when they discende to the chekes / they be called branchus: and
when they come to the nose / they are called corizam: as appears by these
verses:

Si fluit ad pectus / dicatur reuma catarrus /
Ad fauces branchus / ad nares dico corizam.
But besides the reasons of the diseases before rehearsed / there be many other
reasons / and more effectuell. The cause of the first inco^uenie^ce / that is
of fevers / which some time are called putrified fevers / and some time fevers
effimeres. A fever effimere is engendered of vapors and smudge fumes kept and
retained after the after noone sleep / the which absteynynge from sleep is
wont to consume. The forsaide smudge fumes mixyng them self with man's spiritis
engendre an inordinate and a strange fever called effimere. The putrified fever
is ingengdred of the humidites in man undigested / and augme^ted by the after
noone sleep. The.ij. inconvenience that is to be slow in operation and motions
/ chances by reason that by the after noone sleep the humidites and fumes in
man are retained about ye muskyls / veins / and iointis / and causes the
forsayde members to be astonyed and a sleep: and therefore the body after dinner
is slow and heavy in operations. The third inconvenience (that is the heed
age) comes / as is before declared in the.ij. inco^uenie^ce: that is to say /
by the humidites and vapors retained in the body through sleep and rest:
which by such means are troubled and moved toward the brain / and so cause
the heed age. The.iiij. inconvenience is (that is the catarr^) signyfyenge al
manner of reumes / chances to man and vexes him / through vapors and fumes /
which are wont to be dissolved and consumed by watch / by sleep they draw
to the inward partis of man / and fume upward toward the brain: which
fumes engrossed by cold / return to the low partis caterrisans of man's
body. Auicen in the.xiii. did. li.j. in the.ij. doctrine and.ix. chap.
allegeth many other inconueniencis and diseases engendered of the after noone
sleep. The first disease is the gout and palsy. Which grieve us / by reason
that the humidites / that are wont to be dried up and consumed by the heat of
the son / and by watch remain still in the body. The second is the color /
and corruption of the face / through the wattrishe humidites like unto man's
urine myngled with the bludde / which are wont to be wasted by watch / yt
now with the bludde they ascend toward the brain and the face / and cause
it to swelle / and to wax pale. The third inconvenience is / that after noone
sleep ingendreth the spleen / and that by the keeping in of the gross
melancoly humors by the day rest. For as watch with the heat of the day
(which do open) gives mouynge and way to melancoly humors / by the strayte
cundites of the body: so the day sleep lets and distroyeth the passages and
propre ways of them: and specially it destroys the cundites / yt come from
the spleen to the mouth of the stomach / made to provoke man's appetite / by
which cundite all melancoly superfluites are wont commonly to be clarified.
The.iiij. is / that after noone sleep mollifieth the veins / by cause the
humedites / which are wont to be desolued by the day watch / can not be
resolved: which so remaining in man's body dry up the veins. The.v.
inconvenience is / that man by reason of rest or sleep / losethe his appetite /
for lack of humors resolution: which resolution is chief and principal
cause of ye appetite. An other reason is the replenisshynge of the stomach by
fumes and humidites / mollifieth and fyllethe the mouth thereof. The.vi.
inconvenience / that after noone sleep does engendre / is impostumes / by
means of humidites increased by ye day sleep / which draw to one membre or
other / and so cause it to swelle. Auicen says / that besides all these
aforsayde / there be.ij. other special causes / that prove the after noone
sleep to be hurtful. The first is / that the day rest is soon corrupted /
because the heat of the day draws the corporal heat to the exterior
partis of man: but the night rest does clean contrary / for it draws the
corporal heat of man toward the inward partis. Of the which two motions
there is engendered a violent mocion that distourbethe nature. And therefore they
that will sleep and rest them by day: are counsayled to sleep in dark places /
and in the shadow. The.ij. cause is that the day rest makes a man unlusty /
drousy / and as half a ferde / and that by the changynge of nature from his
old custom / that is from digestio^ of his meat: yet not withstanding that
the after noone rest is generally dispreysed / and the night rest greatly
commended and preysed / yet the sleep that is taken in the morning from.iij.
hours before the son rysynge / till.iij. of the clock after ye son is
risen / is not to be dispreysed: As Hippocrates says in his.ij. book of
pronostic. Sleep convenient and natural taken by night or by day is allowable
/ and contrary is hurtful: but the morning sleep of all the day is lest
worthy dispreise. And all be hit the day sleep and at after noone are forbyden
by old fathers and doctors / yet for all that / now adays sleep taken in
the day time is not greatly to be blamed specially as Bartrutius says / if
these.v. conditions therein be diligently observed. The first is / if hit be
customably used: The.ij. that it be not taken immediately after dinner. The.iij.
that one sleep not with a low heed. The.iiij. not to sleep to long. The.v.
not to be waked suddenly and ferfully / but with good moderation.

Spasmus. hydrops. colica / vertigo. quatuor ista.
Here are declared.iiij. inconveniences that come by to long holding of wind
in man's body. The first is called the crampe. The ventosites of the body /
run often among the iointes and veins fyllynge them with wind. Qf the
which fyllynge co^methe retraction and wrynkelynge to gether of the veins.
And Auicen says in his.ij. did. the crampe is a disease that lyethe in the
veins: by the which the members of man move and extend them self. This
crampe is diverse: one is caused by replenyshynge: whereby the membre is made
short and great / and wrynkelynge to gether as lether / or a harp string /
through the matter / replenyshynge the me^bres. This kind of crampe comes
sodaynely. There is a another kind of the crampe much like a taboret: which
inforceth the membre after his length and largenes to crompull to gether like
parchement cast in the fire. This kind of crampe comes slowly. The second
inconvenience is called the dropsye / a material disease engendered of mattier
right cold entering and inflatynge the members or places of man's body / in
which is the regiment / that is the digestion of meats and humors as the
stomach / the liver / and the void places about the bealye. For dropsye never
engenders / but when the liver is corrupt by reason of the bludde. There
be.iij. spices of dropsy. Iposarca / asclides / and tympanites: and of the
tympany this.ij. inco^uenie^ce is understand. A tympany (as says master
Bartruce) is inge^dred of ill co^plextion / by coldenes of the stomach / and
liver / not sufferyng man's drink or meat to be converted in to good humors /
but tourneth them in to ventosites / which if they be avoided by belchynge /
by sweat / or other wise / they will stop the ways of voida^ce. Also these
ventosities gether to gyther between the places of the bealye called mirac /
and siphax / and there ingendreth the dropsy. The.iij. inconvenience / is
called the colike / a perilous and a paynefull disease / it ingendreth in a
gutte named colon. Like as the disease called ilica / is engendered in one of
the guts called ylion. And these.ij. diseases are engendered by ventosites
closed in the guts. The.iiij. inconvenience and disease is the heed ache
called vertigo: which makes a man to wene that the world turns: the
ventosites of the brain causes this infirmite: which drawn to the brain /
and myxte with the lively spiritis / causes the heed age called vertigo.
Auicen in his.xvj. did. reherseth these inconuenie^ces with other: and he
says that ventosites kept long / cause and ingendre the colicke / by reason
they assende and gether to gether / feblysshynge the guts. And some time
ingendreth the dropsye: and some time darkness of sight / and some time the
megryme / and some time the falling yuel / and some time it runs in to the
joints and causes the crampe.

Ex magna cena / stomacho fit maxima pena
Vt sit nocte senis / sit tibi cena breuis.
Here we be taught to make a light souper. For to much meat lettethe man's
natural rest / and causes anguyshe and gnawyng in the bealy / and causes
the face to break out: and makes one to have a heuye heed in the morning /
and an unsavory mouth. Here this question comes well to purpose. Whether a
man should eat more at dinner or at soupper? For a diffinicion here of / it is
to be noted: that after the quantite of the body more or less / meat is
convenient at soupper / or at dinner. For other the bodies be holle and sound /
orelles sick. If they be sick either incline to material sickness / or to
vnmateriall: If ye sickness be not caused through some humor: one may eat the
more at soupper: because in such sickenesses / nature only endeuereth to
digeste the meat. If the sickness be material / one may eat the more at
diner / as it is declared in the.iiij. treatise in the.v. chap. of the curation
of falling sickness on this wise: He that can not be sufficed with one repast
in a day / because he is other wise accustomed / he must divide his meat in
three partis / and eat.ij. partis at dinner / and the other part after
temperate exercise at soupper. The reason here of is this: For in such sesonne
ye feeble nature has help by the natural heat of the son to digest / and
the superfluites there by are more resolved / wherefore the refection should be
larger at diner tha^ at soupper. And more over because the heat of the day /
which causes digestion / joins with the natural heat of man's body: and so
by day are.ij. sondrye heates to help the digestion: but it is not so in the
night. Like wise nature endeuereth by night to digest the superfluites.
Therefore it should not be hyndred to digest with to much meat. And though it
be so that the natural heat of man be in many things fortified in the night:
as by retraction of the spiritis and reductio^ of sleep: yet that self heat
can not digest.ij. diverse things / as the meat / and the superfluites. Than
it follows that such folk should eat less at souper. If the bodies of
such seem hole / or else be very hole / strong / and without any
sensibilite of superfluites / avoiding all through their vigor / as mighty
bygge men: such may eat more at soupper. For the nature of these bodies /
labor only by night to digest the meat received: and not to ripe the
superfluites: for in a manner they have none. Also they labor only to fortify
their bodies / which waxethe more stronger by night / than by day: because
the bludde and corporal spiritis be engendered by night in a more quantite /
and better divided through out the body. If the bodies be not greatly
disposed / as is rehearsed: but are disposed to be lightly sick: Than whether
they travail and labor sore continually with their arms and hands or not:
hit is best they eat more at dinner than at soupper. For meat is not only
taken to norishe and restore ye body: but also to make moist / to over
sprynkylle and water the members / that through great labor and travail they
wax not dry: and like wise to withsta^de the dissolution of natural heat.
Nor such travail and labor lets not their true digestion. For we se by
experience / that they eat twyse or thryse in a day with good appetite / and
good digestion. If the bodies be not apt nor disposed to labor continually /
as ye bodies before rehearsed: hit may chance.ij. ways: For either they labor
very sore / but not continually: or they labor febly: whereby superfluites
encreace. They that travail much: as in rydy^ge or going about their
worldly busynes / should eat more at soupper than at dinner: because the
unaccustomed great travail would not suffer the meat taken at dinner to digest
/ but corrupt hit. Yea and farther through superfluous mocion the natural
heat is disolued / and spredde in every member of the body: which in the
night draws to the inward partis of the body / and is the principal cause
of good digestion. And therefore a good and a large soupper is more expedient
for them / than a large dinner. Also the same persons were not brought up before
this sesonne in such great travail: and therefore their bodies are full of
humidites: which little meat at dinner may resyste ye resolutions caused by
great motions and travail. But in case they travail little and easelye by
the way / to eat more at dinner tha^ at soupper is best: as hit is declared in
sick bodies / for they most commonly are feeble both of co^plection and of
digestion / and the heat and light of the son comfort their natural heat
and spiritis. Also the reason hereof is this / the corporal cu^dites and
passages by day are open: wherefore the superfluites of the body are sooner
expulsed by day than by night. Farther they ought to eat but little meat
by night: for tha^ nature is greatly occupied to digest raw humors: the
which sleep must digest and bring to good point. And though the digestion to
digest and great repletions of meats / and the superfluous humors be help by
the night. Yet never ye less / the streingthynge thereof is not sufficient to
digest great repletions of meats / and also superfluous humors. And weteth
well / ye custom in eaty^ge much or little at dinner or soupper / ought to
be regarded / and kept. For custom is good and necessary / for health of ye
body / and to cure sickness: as appears.li.ij. of sharp diseases. For sodeyne
change of custom is very hurtful / and specially for old folks. For nature
can not bear nor yet suffer sodeyne mutation. And thus it is well proved /
that we ought to eat more at dinner than at soupper: and that because
sickenesses are most commonly materialles / yet for all that / if a man could
be contented with one repast in a day / it were better to take it at soupper /
than at dinner: so that he be not diseased in the eyes / or the brain: for than
it were better to take it at dinner / than at soupper. For the repletion of the
soupper / hurtethe sore the brain and the eyes. And witteth well that not
only the repletion of the soupper / hurts the stomach / but also al manner
of other repletions. For they ingendre opylations / fevers / putrifactions /
the lepre / and undigested humors. And Auicen (in the.xiij. did. of his.iij.
book / and chap. of things that hurt the stomach) says / that al manner of
repletions hurt the stomach: nor ye great eater by repletion augmenteth not his
body / for he digesteth not his meat: but he that eats moderately / has
always some appetite / and increases his body: for he digesteth well his
meat. Therefore we ought to take good head we hurt not our stomach by over
much repletion: nor yt we make not our self poursye / and the pulse to beat
more vehemently. In like manner repletion that inge^dreth lothynge of meat /
ought principally to be eschewed / but specially when it comes of ill meats.
For if hit come by ill meats / hit ingendreth pain in the joints / in the
raynes / in the liver / and the gout: and generally al other fleumatike
diseases. And if it come by clean meats: it inge^dreth sharp fevers / and
hot impostumes. It follows than that this repletion must be eschewed above
al other. For it greueth both soul and body. Secondly we must take heed we
over fylle not our stomakes: and utterly distroye our appetite: but we must
keep some appetite: and specially they that have a strong and a good appetite.
Some there be that have a feeble appetite / and these ought to eat more than
their appetite requires.

Tu nunquam comedas / stomachum nisi noueris ante
Purgatum / vacuumque ^ibo quem sumpseris ante
Ex desiderio poteris cognoscere certo
Hec tria sunt signa subtilis in ore dieta.
Here are certain co^mandementes / which man desiring health / must of
necessite observe and keep more duly than eat or drink. The first is / he
should eat no manner of meats / without his stomach be net / and purged of all
ill humors / by vomet or other convenient ways. For if a man receive meat
with corrupt humors in to his stomach: they will myngle them self to gether
and cause the meat newely eaten to corrupt. The second is / to eat no more
till the first meat eaten be digested and avoided out of the stomach. For
there is nothing more hurtful to man's body / than to cast meat upon meat
not digested / but only begun to be digested. For the meat last taken /
shall let the digestio^ of that yt was first eaten: and the digestion of the
meat first taken / shall be first finyshed: which departs to the liver by ye
veins called miseraikes / and therewith cariethe the meat last taken not yet
well digested. Whereof raw humors and undigested be multiplied in man's body.
Farther in the text are put.ij. tokens / to know when the stomach is void of
the meat before taken. The first is very hunger. And for a knowledge hereof /
witteth well yt there is ij. manner of hungers / very hunger / and feyned
hunger. Very hunger is discriued by Galen in ye comment of the canon of the
aphorism / Indigentia non oportet etc. Very hunger (says he) is when a man
needs meat: But feigned hunger is an appetite to have meat / though the
body has no need thereof. And as very hunger comes by contraction and
corrugation of the veins procedy^ge from the mouth of the stomach / by
sugillation of the members nedynge meat: so in like wise feyned hunger is
wont to be caused of them that co^strayne that they should provoke the mouth
of the stomach / the members having no need of food / as by cold things
hard or sharp. And of this sign and.ij. precept precedent / Auicen.iij.j.
doct.ij. cap. de eo quod etc. says: No man ought to eat but after he has a
lust: Nor he should not tarry long therein / when lust pricketh / onles it be
a feyned lust / as the lust of kronkers / or such whose stomach aborrethe
meat: For to endure hunger long fylleth ye stomach with putrified humors.
And after in the same chap. he says: That who so ever love their health /
should never eat till they have a sure lust: nor tylle their stomach and
vppermoste entrayles / be voided of the first food. For the dangerust thing
that may chance man's body / is to receive meat upon dndigested meat. The.ij.
that signifies true lust / or very hunger / is sklendre diete precede^t: that
is small sustina^ce before taken: for wha^ hunger follows there upon it is
very true hunger. Farther more know ye / that to eat much and of sundry
meats mixed to gether at one repaste or refection / is worste of all: as
flesh and fish / chekyns and porke: and after to prolonge the time in eating:
For the first meat begynnethe now to digest / when the other are brought to
the table: and so the partis of ye meat are unlike in digestion: So that the
first taken are digested / or the last taken come to the mids of their
digestynge: And this causethe that some partis corrupt other some. And this
thing Auice^ iij.j. doct. cap. ij. de eo etc. warns / saying: There is
nothing more dangerous than to myngle diverse sustinances to gether: and after
to prolonge the time in eating. For when the last meat is received / the
first is welnere digested. Therefore the said meats in diverse of their partis
(as touchy^g digestion) be not like. But yet witteth well / that prolongynge of
time in eating moderately (as an hour space) to chawe and swolowe our meat
well / ^lo^ginge ^ne at ^ynet.
is allowable / and helps much to the conservation of health. For good
chawynge and swalowynge down is as half a digestion: And ill chawyng of the
meat does either let digestio^ / orels does greatly hyndre it. But prolongynge
of time in eating / with talking and telling of tales.ij. or.iij. hours /
is right hurtful: and thereof are engendered the diseases before rehearsed.

Persica. poma. pira. lac. caseus. et caro salsa.
Et caro ceruina. leporina. caprina. bouina.
Hec melancolica sunt / infitmis inimica.
Here are declared.x. manner of meats or foodes that ingendre melancolye / and
are unwholesome for sick folks. Of which the first is eating of peches:
Eating of peches.
Whereof Galen.ij. alimentor^ / cap. ix. says / the ieuce of peches / and their
material substance is soon corrupted and utterly ill. Wherefore they ought not
as some say / to be eaten aft other meat. For they swymmynge above are
corrupted. But this ought to be minded / which is a commune thing / that all
that is moist / slyppery / and lightly gothe under / should be eaten first:
and so should peches: which swyftely go to the bottum of the stomach / and
make way for the meats that come after. But when they be eaten last / they
corrupt them self and the other meats. And thus it appears / that this
saying ought to be understand of peches eaten after other meat. For when
they be eaten before meat they be good for ye stomach / mollify the bealye /
and provoke the appetite: as Auicen in the.ij. Canon and chap. of peches
says: Ripe peches be good for the stomach / and gives an appetite to meat.
And farther he says: They ouhgte not to be eaten after other meat: for they
corrupt after / but they must be eaten before. Like wise Serapion / in ye
chaptre of peches / by auctorite of Dioscorides / says: Ripe peches are good
for the stomach / and they mollify the bealy: But when they be not ripe they
make a man costiue: and when they be dry they bind sorer. And decoction made
of dry peches and dronken / does let the flowynge of humidites to ye stomach
and bealy. And the powder of peches cast upon ye place where one bledeth /
stancheth the bludde. And al though peches have these medicinable virtues
aforsaid: yet because they inge^dre putrified humors / they be hurtful to
sick folks / and specially wha^ they be not taken dewly. Peches be cold in
the first degree / and moist in the second. The second is peers / or eating
of peers. The cause is / Eating of peers.
for peers (and generally al manner of new and raw fruit) fylle ye bludde with
water / boylynge up in the body: And so prepares the bludde to putrify / and
by consequens hurtful for sick folks. Peers / as Auicen in.ij. canon^ / and
chap. of them / says / engendre the colicke. But yet peers above all fruit
make folk fat. And therefore hogs fed with peers / are made fatter tha^
with any other fruit. And because peers inge^dre ventosites / and so cause the
colicke: therefore they be used to be eaten with such fruit that break or
avoid ventosites: or else to withsta^de the ill operation of these fruits /
drink after them / a draughte of old wine of good savor. And the sweter
savor that peers have / and the more doulce / the better they be. And also
sodde peers be better tha^ raw: and they may be sodde with anys sede / fenell
sede / and sugar. The third is eating of apples: Eating of apples.
which as Auicen says (.ij. can^. cap. j.) to eat often and much cause
ache of the senowes. And also apples have an ill proprete / in enge^dryng
ventosites in the second digestion / wherefore they be unwholesome for sick
folks. And also for like cause as hit is before said of peers. And these
sayenges of peers and apples ought specially to be understand when they be
raw / and not when they be sodde or roste. And not only these fruits should be
eschewed of them that be sick / but also all other fruits that fill the bludde
with boylynge water: as new fruit / whose ieuce boylethe in man's body as hit
were must or new wine. And ieuce of fruit boil without in a vessel and that
is through the hete of the son that remains in them when they ryped. These
new fruits / through boylynge of their ieuce / cause the bludde to putrify.
All though wha^ they be eaten they comfort a man's body with their moisture.
And for this cause Auicen forbyddeth them specially eating of fruit / yt have
the ague / in his.iiij. did. and chap. of the universal cure / saying: All
fruits hurt them that have the ague / through their boylynge and corruptyng
in the stomach. The.iiij. is eating of milk: Eating of milk.
the cause why eating of milk is not good / is because it is lightly
corrupted / and turns unto fume or sharpenes in the stomach / as in their
stomach specially / that are diseased with putrified fevers: and therefore they
that have a putrified fever are forbyden eating of milk. And to them also hit
is hurtful yt have the heed ache / to them yt have the swyns pockes / and to
many other. Whereof Hippocrates speakethe in the Aphorism: Lac dare caput etc.
to give them milk that have the heed ache is very hurtefull. Yet not
withstanding in some diseases / milk is agreeable for them that have the
tysike / the fever etike / and for some other: as Hipp. says in ye before
allegate aphorism. And also following / some thing shall be said wha^ we
come to Lac ethicis etc. And all though milk in the foresaid diseses is blamed
/ yet in them that be holle it is allowable / and that if it be well digested
in the stomach and liver. For tha^ it washes the e^trayles with it
wattrishenes / and hit mundifieth with hit buttrines: and strives against
venomous humors: and with hit chese moysteth the members / and alleuiateth the
grefes of the breast: and hit does mitigate the shotynge or prickynge of the
longes / guts / raynes / entrayles / and of the bladder: and it is good
against prickynge humors in the entrayles. Farther more milk is good for
te^perate bodies / whose stomach is clean from colerike and flumatike humors.
For to such folk milk well digested is great nourysshynge / hit ingendrethe
good bludde / it nourishes the body / and conuenientlye moysteth and makethe
fair ye exterior partis: as Isaac says in the universal dietis. And there
also he says by auctorite of Ruffus: that they that will drink milk / must
drink it fasting: and it must be drunk hot from the cow: and to eat
nothing till that be digested: and not to labor nor stere about much than.
Yet seldom or at no time one should forbear walking / but than one must
walk an easy pace / till he parceiue hit be descended to the bottum of ye
stomach. But milk is unwholesome for these bodies that be diste^pered. For in
hot bodies it is soon turned in to colerike fumosite. In such as be cold /
hit tournethe to sharpenes and putrefaction. Also milk is unwholesome for an
unclean stomach: for therein it corrupts. Choice of milk.
Touching the choice of milk / hit is to be noted / that mean milk is to be
chosen for nourishement / and not thynne milk / as milk of a camel / or of
an ass: nor the most fat and gross is not to be chosen / as milk of kyne
and sheep: wherefore goottis milk should be chosen. For hit is not so wattrishe
as camels milk: the which is not apt to nourishe / by reason of humidite /
and hit makes a man to laske: Nor it is not so fat / nor so gross / nor so
full of curdes and butter / as kowe milk and shepis milk is: which by reason
of their fatnes / stop the heynes / and engendre ve^ / tosites: and is more
harder of digestion tha^ is necessary in governance of health. Therefore milk of
a gootte / not to nere kyddynge time nor to far from it / and that goth in a
good pasture / and when pastures be at the best / should be chosen. The.v. is
eating of chese: Eating of chese.
and it may be understand of all sorts of chese / but specially of old
chese. The reason is because new chese is cold / moist / and of gross
substance / and hard of digestion: and engenders opilations and the stone:
and helps or co^serueth man's health (by way of nourisshement) very littell or
nothing: And old chese is hot and dry / by reason of the salt therein /
hit causes digestion: but yet of it self / it is hard of digestion / and of
small nourisheme^t / and hurts the stomach / and dries over sore / and
agrees wors tha^ new chese. But chese between both / neither new nor old /
The bontie of chese
not to tough nor to brittill / to hard nor to soft / to sweet nor to sower /
not to salt / nor to full of eyes / of good tallege and of good savor when it
is cut / which tarieth not long in the stomach / made conveniently of good
milk / sufficiently oily. Such chese is good and should be chosen before all
other: whereof after meat we should eat a little quantite: for much in
qua^tite / in way of nourisheme^t is universally ill / and hurts the stomach
/ and will not digeste / and engenders opilations / the stone in the raynes /
gross humors in the body / and ventosites. Therefore that chese is only good
that comes out of any gardes hands. The.vj. is salt meat: dried with salt
or smooke / Salt meat.
and of what kind of best so ever hit be / hit engenders gross bludde and
melancoly: and so per co^sequens / it is unwholesome for sick folks: nor
wholesome for them that be hole: as Auicen.ij.j. doct. ij. cap. xv. about the
end / says: that salt flesh nourissheth but littell / and that it is
gross / and enge^dreth ill bludde. The.vij. is hartis flesh / Hartis flesh.
which like wise enge^dreth melancolye bludde / as witnesses Rasis Alma^.iij.
cap. de animalibus siluestribus et domesticis. The.viij. is hare flesh / Haare
flesh.
which like wise engenders melancoly bludde / as Rasis says in ye place
before allegate: This flesh enge^dreth more mela^colye than any other. And of
this Isaac in dictis vniuersalibus says: that hare flesh should not be eaten
as meat / but only used in medicines. And witteth well that hare flesh and
hartis flesh / when they be old ought utterly to be eschewed: yet never the
les they may be eaten / and they be best before caluynge time / that their
drines may be tempered with the age: And yet they ought to be eschewed except
they be fat. For their drines is tempered with their fatnes. The.ix. is
goottis flesh. The.x. is ox flesh. For these be melancolye flesshes. For
Isaac in dictis universe. says: Gootis flesh and ox flesh be worst / Gootis
flesh. (...).
hardest / and s^owest of digestion: and when they be digested / they engendre
gross bludde and melancoly. And Auicen in his.ij. canon of goottis flesh
says: Goottis flesh is not very good / and perchance the humor is very ill.
And like wise ye shall understand of goottis flesh and cowes flesh: which
are worse than the forsaide fleshes / gootis and ox flesh. For of them Auicen
in the.ij. Canon the chap. of flesh / says: Cow flesh / hartis flesh /
wild goottis flesh / and great fowls enge^dreth the fevers quartans. And yet
farther he says of cow flesh: that cow flesh nourissheth much / and
engenders gross melancoly / and melancoly disseases. And he says farther
that cow flesh engenders lepre. And of goottis flesh he says that hit is
absolutely ill. And for as much as hit is touched in ye text what fleshes
should be eschewed / specially of.iiij. footed bestes: me seems hit were
convenient / to show / what flesh of.iiij. footed bestis are to be chose^.
And in the choice of fleshes the physicians agree not. Choice of fleshes.
For Galen and certain other say / that porke is best. Some other / as Auicen
/ Rasis / and Auerroys say / that kyddis flesh is best. Yet not withstanding
Auerroys in the.v. coll. blamethe Auicen / by cause he said porke was best:
yet he said it not as though he held therewith / but after the christen
opinion. Some other preyse vele above all other. The.ij. is / a man may know
the best flesh of.iiij. footed bestis and ye goodness thereof many manner of
ways. First by great nourisshynge / which thing betokens hard digestion /
and by the lykenes of man's flesh: and this wise porke is better tha^ any other
flesh / first for the lykenes unto man's flesh: as witnesses Galen.iij.
alimentor^ / where he says: That porke is like man's flesh / may be known /
by that that many have eaten ma^s flesh instead of porke / and could not
perceive neither by the savor nor the taste / but that hit had been porke. And
Auicen.ij. canon^. cap. de sanguine / says: Man's bludde and hogs bludde be
like in every thing: so that there have been that have sold man's flesh instead of porke / which thing was not spied / till a man's finger was fond
among ye flesh. Auerrois writes ye same in the.v. coll. cap. de carne.
Secondely / Porke nourishes greatly. For Gal. says.iij. alimentor^ / that
porke above other flesh nourishe most: whereof those that be called athlete
have best experience. And after in the same book he says: One can eat no
flesh ye nourishes more tha^ porke. Thirdly porke enge^dreth a steadfast and
a strong nourishement / resistynge resolution. This is Galens opinion in the
places before rehearsed / where he preferrethe porke above all other flesh: and
in his.viij. book de ingenio / he says / Porke of all flesh is most
laudable: so that it be wild brought up on montaynes: and next porke kyd. And
like wise in.v. tera. he says: Of al flesh of.iiij. footed bestis porke is
most laudable / which is temperate in heat and moisture: and engenders
better bludde tha^ any other flesh: so that hit be of young swyne / that is of
a year or.ij. old / whether hit be wild or tame: nor young suckers are not so
good: for their flesh is most moist. And of a more lykelyhod wild porke
brought up in the woddes / is better than tame brought up at home: for tame
porke is more clammy tha^ it ought to be. And of wild hogs flesh or boore /
Auicen.ij. Canon^ / cap. de carne / says: Christen men and their folowers say
/ The best hog flesh
that the best wild flesh that is / is of a wild swyne. For besides that
that it is more light than ye tame swynes flesh / it is of more strength and
much more nourishynge / and more sooner digesteth: and in winter there can be
no better flesh. So tha^ it follows that hogs flesh is right good and
wholesome for their bodies that be young / hole / strong / occupied in labor /
and not disposed to opilatio^s: and for them that desire to be fat. For such
have need of much nourishement: and hard of digestion. And therefore
Rasis.iij. Alma^soris / cap. de virtute carniu^ / says: Gross flesh is
conuenable for them ye labor much: but clean flesh is best for them that do
contrary wise. Auicen will the same.iii.i. ca. de regimine eius quod
comeditur. saying: They that labor much may better a way with gross meats
than other. The choice of good flesh stands in.iij. things: in temperance
of co^plection / in lightness of digestion / and ingendry^ge of good bludde:
that is to say / the better flesh is of temperate complexion / easy of
digestion / and temperate in engendrynge bludde / between hot and cold /
sklendernesse / and grossenes. And for this cause kydde flesh is better and
more laudable than any other flesh / after the mind of Rasis / Auicen / and
Auerrois. For Rasis.iii. Alma^soris / ca. de animalibus / siluestribus et
domesticis. says: Kydde flesh is temperate / without any ill mixion: the
which though it ingendre temperate bludde / yet hit is not convenient for
laborers: but yet for all that / no another flesh should be preferred before
it. Hit is not so weke / that man strength is minished thereby: nor the
nourishynge thereof is so much gross / ye replecion should come of it / or
gross bludde be engendered. The bludde also that is engendered thereof / is
between subtle and gross / hot and cold. Nor this flesh is not mete for
greatte laborers / but for attemperate young folks / using mean exercise.
For this flesh engenders bludde / that by mighty exercise or labor is sone
resolved / but not with mean travail. And (touching the inte^tion) as kydde
flesh is better tha^ any other housolde flesh / so gottis flesh is better
tha^ any other bredde in the woddes. And next to kydde flesh many physicians
/ as Rasis and Auerrois / put mutto^. And Auerrois says.v. coll. cap. de
carne: That most part of physicians are of this opinion / save Galen which
laudeth not mutton. And he thinks that veale nourishes more than mutton. And
perauenture Galen understands here the betternes of nouryshement of that that
is to nourishe much / and to give nourissheme^t more hard of resolution /
which more agrees unto veale than mutton / syns mutton is of more humidite.
Thirdly the goodness and choice of flesh may be taken by reason of their
small cla^mynes / and by their good savor: and herein veale is better than
any other flesh. And this is showed of Auerrois.v. coll. ca. de carne /
saying: And veale is good flesh because hit is not cla^my / cold / nor dry
as befe is / and veale has a swetter savor than any other flesh: and in
these poyntis it is better than kydde flesh: for in kyd flesh one may
perceive a clammynes before it is sodde: and in that ye veale inge^dreth better
humors / it is better tha^ kyd. And thus it appears plainly what is the
cause of controuersite among physicians touching the choice of flesshes. The
co^tr^uersite in choice of flesh.
Farther witteth well / that the flesh of dry co^plection / is better nere
caluynge time tha^ far from it: And therefore kyddis and caulues be better
tha^ goottis and oxen: because their drines is abated with the humidite of
their yongnes. But flesh of beastis of moist complexion / is better and more
wholesome in age than in youth. For their ouermoche humidite is dried much
away / as they encreace in age: And therefore wethers of a year old are less
cla^my and more holsomer than suckynge la^mes: and like wise porkes of a year
or.ij. old / are better tha^ young pigs. And therefore Auicen says
well.iii.i. cap. de reg. eius quod comeditur. It behooves yt the meat / that
conserueth health should be such as the flesh of kydde or a suckyng caulfe is
/ or la^mes of a year old. By these reasons it apperethe than that the flesh
of goottis male and female / of old mutton / of befe / of old porke / and
specially of brawne / of pigs / and of suckynge lammes / is not very wholesome
for the conservation of man's health: but the flesh of young caulues / of
yerelynge wethers / and porke of a year or.ij. old / is convenient inoughe to
eat to preserve man's health. Flesh.
And it is to be well noted / that flesh enclyned to drynes / must be sodde:
and inclynynge to humidite / must be roasted / to attempre their humidite: And
therefore the flesh of conys / haaris / hearts / calves / and kyddis / should
be sodde: and porke and la^me roasted: for seething attemprethe the drynes. And
herby appears / that in moist seasons / and for moist complections flesh
disposed to drynes / should be roasted: and in dry seaso^s / and for
complections dry and old / moist meats be more convenient.

Qua recentia / vina rubentia / pinguia iura.
Cum simila pura nature sunt valitura.
Here in this text been expressed diverse nouryshynge meats. Of eggs.
The first are new laid eggs / which be of that sort / that in littell
qua^tite nourishe much / as says Auicen.ii. canon^. cap. de ouis. and like
wise he says in.iiij.j. cap. j. Things (says he) of small quantite and
great nourishement are eggs and cocks stones. And the self same he repetethe
in many other places. Touching the choice of eggs / witteth well that the
eggs of hens / pertriches / and fesances young and fat are very good in
regiment of health / and simply / better tha^ any other eggs: For the pressed
daughter said / that long eggs and small were the best of all / as in these
verses: Filia presbiteri iubet pro lege teneri.
Quod bona sunt oua / candida / longa / noua.


Farther / poched eggs / are better than eggs roasted hard or rere / and they
be of great nourishement / and of good and light digestion / and enge^dre
bludde specially proportionable to the heart: Wherefore they be exceeding good
for such as be recovered from sickness / for aged folk / and for weak
persons / and specially the yolke. For Auicen in the treatise de viribus cordis
says: that the yolke of eggs / of fowls whose flesh is good to be eaten /
as of hens / pertriches / and fesantis / though they be not medicinable for
the heart / yet they comfort right much. And he addethe following: That they
be lightly turned in to bludde: and after they be turned / they have small
superfluite: And therefore they comfort most specially the heart. And farther
he says / that they be excellent good to restore the spiritis and bludde of
the heart: Rere roasted eggs are lightly digested / and they ease ye longes and
the breast / and mollify the bealy te^perately / but they nourishe not so
much as poched eggs. Hard eggs sodde are hard of digestio^ / and they
nourishe the body grossly / descendynge slowly to the stomach / and slowly
they enter therein: Farther witteth well / that eggs by the dressinge of them
are made better and worse: Dressynge of eggs.
For either they be roasted / sodde / or fried / or sodde with some brothe.
Roasted eggs be more gross than sodde / and more hard of digestion: for the
herthe or fire driethe up their substanciall humidite. And they be roasted.ij.
ways: For either in the shelles they be raked in the hot imbers / orels they
be broken in the shelles. They that be broken be worse than the other: but they
that in the shelles be raked in the hot imbers are done.ij. manner of ways /
either they be all raked in the imbers / orels set upon imbers and coals with
part uncovered. They that be al covered be worse: for by reason that the heat
of the fire goth about them / the fumosites / are kept still in / they that be
set upon the ymbers / part uncovered / avoid out the fumosites and be
mundified. They be better sodde^ in water tha^ roasted: for the humidite of the
water strives with the heat of the fire / drienge their humidite. And so they
be dressed.ij. ways: For either they be sodde in the shelles / orels broken in
the water. Sodden in the shelles are worse than the other. For the shelles
let dissolution of fumositees and grossenes. When they be poched / the heat
of the water temperately perceth in / and makes more pure their grossenes: and
takethe away the ill smell and savor. Wherefore poched / they be most wholesome
/ and worst fried: For fried they ingendre most ill humors / Rasis opinion in
dict. vniuersa.
and hurt the stomach / and causethe fumosite and corruption / and makes one
to loathe his meat. But sodde in some good brothe are between both / roasted
and poched. Also wytteth well / that there is a diversity in an egg /
touching his co^ponde partis. For the yolke is temperately hot: The white is
cold and clammye / and hardlye digesteth / and the bludde also thereof
engendered / Rasis.iii. Alm. ca. de vir. ouoru^.
is not good. And as the forsayde eggs / that is to say of hens / pertriches
/ and of fesantis / be more co^uenable in ye regiment of health: so eggs of
duckes / gees shouelardis / and such like fowls / are unwholesome in the
regiment of health / and should be eschewed. The.ij. is red wine. Red wine
Where upon ye shall understand / yt wynes differ in colors. For some wynes
be white / some claret / some citrine / and some black. White wine is febler
tha^ any other / colder and less nourishyng / but they leest hurt the heed /
and they make one to pysse better than other. That they be weaker than other
wynes appears: for after Galen. super.i. canone.iii. perticule regiminis
acutorum. Weak wine is hit / that leest heteth or enflameth / and less
greueth the brain than other. That white wynes be colder than other apperethe
by Galen in the comment of the canon.iii. partic. reg. acutoru^. where he
says of white wine / thus: It is impossible that white wine should greatly
inflame any man. And after he says: White wine enflameth or heteth leest of
all wynes. Which thing is true / if one will make comparison between white
wine and read of one country growing / and none other wise. For the red
wynes of France are not so hot / nor yet so strong as the white wynes of
some other country. And therefore the comparison must be made between the wynes
of one manner and country: and that they nourishe less than other wynes
appears by Galen in the comment of this aphorism.ii. particule aphoris. It is
easyer to fill one with drink than with meat: where he says: Watterysshe
sklender and white wine / is universally neighbor to water: and as touching
nourishement is like water / whereby it provoke one to piss / and nourishes
one to pysse. And this is the cause / that strong wynes / be not convenient
for feeble brayned folks / as it is said: But it agrees well with them that
have a strong brain: For a strong brain resists vapors wha^ they smite
up there unto / as Auicen says.iij.j. and chap. before allegate. And here
notes well / that the wit of a man having a strong brain / is clarified
and sharped / if he drink good wine / than if he drank none / as Auicen
says.iij.j. and chap. before allegate. And the reason is / because of good
wine more than of any other drink are engendered and multiplied subtle
spiritis clean and pure. And this is the reason why that these diuins /
imagynynge and studyenge high and subtyle matters / love to drynge good wynes.
And after the opinion of Auicen in the forsayde chap. these wynes are good for
men of cold and flumatike complexion. For such wynes redress and amend the
coldenesse of complexion: and they open the opilations and stoppynges / that
are wont to be engendered in such persons / and they digest fleme / helpinge
nature to convert and turn them in to bludde: they lyghtlye digeste / and
enter quickly / they encreace and greatly quicke^ the spiritis. But wine
citrine is not so burning as read claret / as Galen in the comment of the
canon before allegate says. Red wines be hotter than white / and therefore
they grieve the heed more / as Galen says in the canon / Potus autem duicis.
Also claret wine nourishes less than read / and more than white. And in some
places they call claret wine white: and that is ye cause that some say that
white wine does quickly inflame man's body. The black wynes be not so fervent
hot as the red be. And therefore they hurt the heed less. But for as much
as they disce^de more slowly in to the bealy / and provoke more slowly man's
urine / they grieve the heed more tha^ white wine / as Galen says in the canon
Potus autem dulcis. And these wynes nourishe less than white or citrine / and
less than red wine. The third is suppynges / made of good brothe of flesh
/ suppinges or brothes.
but specially of chekyns: for such brothes are very friendly to man's nature:
and are lightly converted in to good bludde / and ingendrethe good bludde /
specially when hit is made with fine flower. For flower / principally of wheat
/ is greatly nouryshynge / and causes great nourisheme^t / as says
Ra^is.iij. Alman. And these.iij. forsayde things Auicen puts.ii.i. doct.
ii. su^ma. i. ca. xv. in ye end / where he says: Example of clean and good
nouryshynge meats and humors be the yolks of eggs / wine / and brothes made
of flesh: and there upon he concludes / that these.iij. forsayde things are
comfortable and of great restoratiue for man's body.

Nutrit et impinguat / triticum / lac / caseus infans.
Testiculi / porcina caro / cerebella medulle.
Dulcia vina / cibus gustu iocundior / oua
Sorbilia / mature ficus / vueque recentes.
Here are touched.xij. manner of things / which greatly nouryshe and make
fat man's body. The first is breadde made of wheat: Breadde.
which as Auicen says.ii. can^ cap. de pane. fatteth swyftely / specially
when it is made of new wheat. Rasis iij. Alm^ says: wheat is neighbor to
te^pera^ce / all though it incline a littell to heat: and the heuiest and
soundest / nourishes best: and of all graynes hit is most wholesome for all
folks: And the bludde engendered thereof is more temperate than of any other
grain. Choice of wheat.
Touching the choice of wheat / ye shall understand that the election is to
be considered.ii. manner of ways: First on the bihalfe of his substance: an
other way on the bihalfe of his preparation. The choice on ye byhalfe of his
substance Auic. puts.ij. can. chap. of corn / saying: That is the better
that is neither hard nor soft / great / fat / and new / not to old /
between read and white. Black wheat is an ill nouryssher. Rasis says hit
is heuye. Touching the choice concerning the preparation / witteth well /
that all things made of wheaten flower desce^de from the stomach slowelye /
engendre gross humors / cause opilations about the liver / augment the
spleen / and engendre the stone / and digested nouryshe much. Wheat sodde is
heavy meat and indigestable / but when it is digested / it nourishes strongely
/ and strength a man much. But wheat made in bread / well leuened / and
bake^ in an oven / hatte with moderate fire / is marvelous wholesome. All these
things are gethered of Galen Alime^toru^. The.ij. thing is milk: Buttter
milk.
and after the mind of some doctors / it is understand by butter milk /
called o^or / and co^monlye called balbuca. there is nothing nourishes more
than this milk / wha^ hit is new sopped up with new hot breadde. Hit may
also be understand by goottis milk: Gootis milk. Grene chese.
which nourysheth much: whereof we have largely spoken before. The.iij. thing
is grene chese / which as Auicen says.ii. can. cap. de caseo / is a
nourisher and a fatter. And al though grene chese nourysheth and fattethe / yet
hit is not wholesome in the regiment of health: for thereof come the
inconveniences before declared / Persica poma etc. The.iiij. thing is stones:
and specially stones of fat cocks: which as Auice^.ii. can. ca. de
testiculo / Coyllion^.
says: be very good and great nourishers: And he says that in a small
qua^tite they nourishe much. This also may be understand of hogs stones
very fat / that has not boorred a low. For as porke of all.iiij. legged
bestis (touching his nouryshynge) is best / in like manner the stones / in
regard of other beastis stones / are the best. And here is to be well noted /
that the stones of aged bestis / whose sede is fermented / be nothing
nouryshynge. But the stones of young bestis / not yet able to do their kind /
whose sede of generation is not yet ripe: be of metely good nourishement / if
they be well digested. The.v. thing is porke / Porke.
in choosing whereof / and of theffecte of the same / is largely declared before
/ there / Persica poma etc. The.vj. thing is eating of brains: And wyttethe
well that brain is ill for the stomach / Eating of brains.
and causes lothsomnes / and takethe a way a man's appetite / and enge^dreth
gross humors: yet never the less hit nourishes the body / if hit be well
digested: But in no wise hit should be eaten after other meats. And if hit be
dressed with penyriall or nepte / to attempre the cla^mynes and cold thereof /
or with things / that by their virtue give hete: hit is good and wholesome. And
take heed / eat no brain / outcepte hit be first hatte upon the coals. And
witteth well / that it is not good for them that be sick other while of cold
diseases: but for them that be hot of co^plection hit is wholesome / as
Rasis.iij. Alm. says / in the chap. de virtutibus membrorum animalium. And
brefely hit is forbidden in the regiment of health. But yet some time hit does
well in medicine: as the brain of a little gootte is good against venom /
and against venomous byttynges: And a haaris brain against trembling: And
some say the brain of chekyns and capons is good for the memory / and
comfort the wit. Choice of brains.
Yet touching the choice of brains / hit is to be known / that the best
brains be of fowls that flee / and proprely about montaynes. And of.iiij.
foted bestis the best is of a ra^me / and next of a caulfe / as Auicen
says.ii. can. cap. de cerebro. The.vij. is marie / which well digested
nourysheth much: Mary.
as Auicen says in the foresaid canon and chap. of marie. And hit is lightly
turned in to bludde: yet never the less / it distroyeth the appetite / and
makethe one to loathe his meat: And therefore Auicen teachethe us to eat them
with peper. And touching the choice / Auicen says the mary of veale / of a
heart / of a bulle / of gootis / and of sheep / is most wholesome. And some say
the marye of young fat bulls / is very wholesome and good. The.viij. is sweet
wynes: whereof we shall entreat after there / Sunt nutratiua. Delicious meats.
ii. particula aphorismorum.
The.ix. is delicious meats / for such most specially nouryshe / as
Hippocrates says. And Galen says / that all souorie meat / wherein one
deliteth wha^ he eats hit / the stomach receives and reteyneth / and
digesteth that with a far greatter delectation tha^ other: But if the meat
be loathsome / the stomach will not abide hit: whereof vomit / abhorrynge of
meat / inflation / and belchynge are engendered. And that is ye cause we se
some more helthye with course meat / tha^ with good / because the course is
more delicious unto them. The.x. is rere eggs: rere eggs
which in small quantite nourishe much / whereof we have spoken before at oua
recentia etc. The.xj. is ripe fygges: which through their swetnes / nourysshe
and fat much. And touching fygges / Ripe fygges.
though they nouryshe not as stronglye as flesh and grain: yet there is no
fruit so strong a nourysher: as Auicen says.ii. can. cap. de ficubus. And
there he says / that fygges nouryshe more than any other frutis. And he says
in regimine eius quod comeditur / that frutis of most nourishement / and most
like and nere unto flesh in nourishynge / be fygges / very ripe resyns / and
dates. As concerning the choice of them / witteth well / Choice of fygges.
that after Auicen in the place above allegate de ficubus. The white is best /
for hit is lighter: next the ruddy or citrine / Rasis in the place before
allegate / hit nourishethe well / and comfort the stomach and liver / and
auoydethe opilations. And hit is said / that the liver is fatted with them /
and specially if they be cleansed from ye graynes or kyrnels. And thus the
forsaid text may be understand of a fresh gethred grape or a resyn: or of a
dry grape called passula.

Vina probantur odore / sapore / nitore / color.
Si bona cupis vina. hec tunc probantur in illis
Fortia / formosa / fragrantia / frigida / frisca.
Here in this text be declared.v. manner of proves of good wine. The tokens of
good wine.
The first is ye smell / for wine of good odor and flauour multiplieth man's
spiritis: and as Constantine.v. theorice says / it nourishethe well and
engendrethe good bludde: But stynkynge wine is unwholesome for man's nature /
engendrynge gross and melancolye spiritis. And after the mind of the said
Constantine / hit engenders ill bludde and heed ache of the ill fume
ascendynge to ye heed. Galen.iii. reg. acut. co^mento. i. speaking of the
diversity of wynes / of the odor says: that wine that has good smell /
enge^dreth good bludde / but it fylleth ones heed full of fumes and vapors /
because of the subtilte and heat thereof: But ill smelling wine / after the
quantite of ill bludde engendered thereby / hurts the heed very little /
because hit is cold and gross. The.ij. is savor: for like as good sauorye
meat norysheth better and is better received of the stomach / as is aforsayde
/ in like wise so does wine. But ye shall understand / ye wynes differ in
savor: for some be sweet / more nourishynge tha^ other / engendrynge gross
bludde / and moystynge the bealye / yet they be hard of digestion / and
engendre thyrst. There is a another sort of wynes called pontica or styptica /
which comfort the stomach / and eases the bealy / but hit hurthe the breast
and purtenance / as the longes / and the pype thereof: wholesome for the entrayles
and hard of digestion. There be other wynes yt be sharp or sower: that
provoke ones urine / they engendre not / but they dissolve gross humors.
There be other bitter wynes less hot: as says Constantine.v. theorice.
The.iij. is clerenes or brightness / which shows the pureness of the wine /
and so consequentlye of the spiritis thereof engendered. The.iiij. is the color.
In color wynes vary and differ greatly in their nouryshynge. For the ruddier
wynes of the same parell are more noryshyng than white. And therefore they be
more wholesome for lean folk than white: yet the white be more wholesome for them
yt be fat. And of this diversity of wine in color / we have spoken before at
/ oua recentia. Farther in the text are put.v. special things / how a man
should prove and know good wine. First is by ye strength / which is known
by the operation. Gal. comme^to.i.iii. pari. reg. acutorum.
For as Gal. says strong wine is hit that vehementlye enflameth a man's body /
and repleteth the heed. This strong wine is special encreacer of the spiritis
/ and a great norysher. But yet I advise them yt have a weak brain to be ware
how they drink strong wine / outcept hit be well alayed with water. For the
fumishenes thereof hurts ye heed. The.ij. is fairenes of the wine: For the
fairenes or goodlynes of the wine / causes one to drink it desirously /
which causes hit better to digest / and better to norishe. The.iij. is
fragrant and of good odor. For fragrant and redolent wine comforts most /
and engenders subtle spiritis / as it is said. The.iiij. is / that wine
must be cold touching the taste / but hot in effect and operation. For
wine made hot / by reason of the clerenes / and fynes / over comes a man's
brain the sooner / febleth the senowes / and hurts the heed but if hit be
taken moderately. The.v. is / that wine must be friske and sprynkelynge / and
with the spumynge to make a littell noise / and the spume to be thynne and
soon flashed / and the spume to tarry in the mids. For if it have not these
propretes / it must be called hanging / that is feeble wine / and specially if
hit make no sown / and has great bubbuls and spume / that tarieth long by
the sides of the cup.

Sunt nutratiua plus dulcia candida vina. Here is one doctrine of wine
declared: which is that gross and sweet wynes be more nourishynge than any
other of the parell. To this agreethe Constantine in the above allegate place:
and so does Auicen.iii.i. cap. de reg. aque et vini. where he says: Gross
wine that is doulce / is best for him that would be fat. The reason is /
because the doulce wynes / for their doulcetnes / are vehemently drawn of the
me^bres / where with nature rejoices. For Auicen says.ii. can. tract. i. cap.
iii. that the operations of dulce wynes are digestion / mellowy^g / and
encreasynge of nourishement / and nature loves hit / and the virtue attractiue
drawethe hit. And all though this text may be verified by all doulcet wynes /
yet the moderate doulce wine / is to be chosen / and not that that is exceeding
doulce / as muskadell: For such corruptethe the bludde / by reason that nature
draws hit violently from the stomach to the liver / before it be well digested
/ and before the superfluite thereof be ryped / and through the great dulcetnes
thereof / hit fyllethe the bludde with undigested aquosite / that makes ye
bludde apt to boil and putrify. And this also should be understand by other
meats exceeding sweet. And farther wytteth well / Three inconuenie^ce
engendered of doulce foodes.
that of the use of sweet wine and other doulce nourishementes.iij.
inconveniences are to be feared / specially of them yt be inclined thereto. The
first is lothyng: for ye sweet foodes / through their heat and moisture
suppull and fill the mouth of the stomach / and there enge^dre a disposition
contrary to the vacuation and corrugacio^ of hit / that causethe hunger.
The.ij. is swyfte infla^mation of these doulce foodes and converting in to
coler. For doulce things most aptly enge^dre coler. Therefore honey above all
other things soonest engenders coler / because of sweet things it is most
swetest: and next honye is sweet wine / as Galen says. And here upon rises
thyrstynes / Gal. in co^me^to can. iii. pert. reg. acutorum.
nor hit is not wholesome for them that have ye ague / nor for colerike folks.
The third is opilation of the liver and spleen: For these.ij. members / and
specially the liver draw dulce things with their dregs / to them / for the
great delight they have in them / before they be digested. Wherefore there they
lightly cause opilations / through the help and operation of the gross
substance / wherein the sauorynes of swetenes is grounded / as Auicen says.ii.
can. tract. i. cap. iii. And this is the cause that sweet wine does less stere
one to pysse tha^ other wynes. Against these.iij. nocume^tis egre or sharp
sauory things are very wholesome: for with their tartnes they provoke the
appetite: and with their coldness they que^che enfla^mation / and with their
fynes of substance they open opilations. Farther / wytteth well / that all
though sweet wynes / and other doulce nourishementes / stop or shut the
liver and spleen: yet they vnstoppe the lo^ges. And the reason why they stop
not the longes as well as the liver and spleen / Gal. declares in the co^me^t
of the can^.iii. part. reg. acut. Because doulce things in their passage /
resude nothy^ge there to / but that that is fine and pure: and the bludde
engendered of doulce things comes to the longis / purified first in the liver
/ Hipp. iii. perticu. reg. acut. can. Me^tem lemus etc.
and fined in the heart. Also as Hippocrates says / Doulce wynes do leest make
one dronken. Thus we may conclude / that if wine be drunk for nourishement /
for restoratiue of the body / and to make one fat / as it cha^ceth in them
that be lean / whether it be naturally or accidentally: than doulce wynes and
gross / sufficiently colored are wholesome. For such wynes are nouryshers /
restore ^es of such as be low brought / and fatters. Wherefore they be most
convenient to fat lean bodies. But if we entende not to nourishe / to
restore or make fat our bodies / as they that be corsye and fat: than
though we may not use sweet wynes but subtle / yet they must chose such as
be amiable / and have good savor and flauour / inclined to whitenes / and
sufficiently strong. If one drink wine to quench his thyrste / than he must
take white wine / thynne and feeble. For such wine do moist more / and
coulethe more: and so consequently / better quenches thyrste: And the greatter
the thirst is / the holsomer such wine is. But if so be wine be drunk to
refreshe ye spiritis / and comfort the corporal virtue: than hit would be
subtle / sweet / and of delectable savor / of mean color / and of
sufficient strength: and such wine ought to be taken with litell meat: and
hit must be depured from either superperfluite / and to be taken in small
quantite. But if we purpose to scour the breast and longes / and to cause us
to laske: than doulce wynes of mean substance / and of good flauour should be
chosen.

Si vinum rubeum nimium quandoque bibatur /
Venture stirpatur / vox limpida turpificatur.
This text shows to us.ij. hurtis / that come by over much drinking of
red wine. The first is / that over much drinking of red wine / makes one
costyue. The cause after the opinion of some / is. For such red wine
heatethe more than other of the parell / and is more nutratiue. For in that
that hit is hotter / hit dries more: and in that ye hit is more nutratiue / it
is more desirously retained of nature. But yet this text may be understand by
over much drinking of byndynge red wine / which is some what eger / sharp
/ and costiue. Yet concerning this / wytteth well / that if the stomach or the
guttis be feeble in their natural operation: than read or black wine / called
stypticke / that is some what tarte / ought to be used and dro^ken: as they do
/ that by debilite of stomach / can hold nothing / but be laxatiue. This
says Hippocrates in the canon Palmeus quidem etc. And also Galen in the
comment of the same. But if we will comfort the virtue of digestion / the clean
wine or mean in substance and color / of good odor / and of convenient
savor / and of sufficient strength / and some what stipticke / is most
wholesome. The.ij. is horsenes of ye throat / which horsenes / some red wines
/ through their drynes and erthynes / cause and enduce. And this hurt comes
also by drinking of red wynes growing in the parties of Brabant / through
their stipticalnes and erthynes: and specially when the said wynes be not
fined / this grefe chancethe. But yet they make not a man costiue: For must
that is very read / is wont to cause the flixe / by reason of his erthye
dregs myngled there with all: which byteth and gnaweth the guttis: of which
gnawynge comethe the flixe. And such wine should not be drunk till hit be
fined. For so long as hit is gnawynge / through the erthy dregs thereof / a
mordicant fume is raised to the brain / which gnawethe or bytethe the eyes /
and makes them read: Such inconveniences are engendered by new vnfyned wynes
of Brabant / whether they be white or read / through their erthynes. The cause
why this fume is mordicatiue is by cause ye wine that he comes of is
mordicatiue. Gal. in co^mento illius aphori. Et qui crescunt etc.
For Gal. says: What so ever is dissolved from a thing / must needs be like
the thing / from which hit is dissolved.

Allea / nux / ruta / pira / raphanus / et tyriaca.
Hec sunt antidotum contra mortale venenum.
In this text are comprised.vj. remedies against venom. The first is
garlyke: which is very medicinable against such inco^ueniences / Garlyke.
as are wont to engendre of water: and specially hit is wholesome / if one
drink ill corrupt water. Whereof Serap^on in the segregatis and chap. of
garlyke says: That if one eat garlyke first / and drink corrupt water after
/ hit shall not hurt him. In like wise says Auicen.ii. can. cap. de alleo.
et.iii.i. ca. de conser. a nocu. diuer. aquarum. The same operacion is also in
oynions / as Auicen says.ij. can. and chap. of oynions / and so oynions may be
comprehended under garlyke. And Auice^ in ye fore allegate place says: That an
oynion is subtle / percynge / and scouring / with stipticite: and opens
strongly: and is hot in the third degree: wherefore it heateth ill waters /
prohibitynge / that they with their coldness hurt not the stomach: and hit
makethe pure gross humors / causynge them lyghtely to penytrate. And vinegar
myxte with an oynion does greatly fortify his virtue subtle and penitratiue
/ and keeps one from thyrstynes / which oynions eaten are wont to enduce.
This same is verifiedde of garlyke. And Auicen says in the above allegate
place / that one should eat garlyke / after drinkyng of gross and troblous
waters: for hit fyneth them / and makes them lightly to discende: and lettethe
that they hurt not the stomach and entrayles: and that they stop not the
veins. And garlykeis good eaten before one take his journey. and after that
hit is one of the best and most holsomest things that can be / for them that
come out of a cold aier or go in to hit: as Auicen says.iii.i. cap. de
regendo iter. And by this appears that garlyke is specially good for them that
journey and wander over diverse countres / and use diverse drynkes / according
to these verses: Allea qui mane ieiuno sumpserit ore.
Hunc ignoratum non ludit potus aquarum.
Nec diuersorum mutatio facta locorum.


More over garlyke is good against ye styngynge of venomous worms / and
bytynges of serpentis / when hit is dronken with wine: which thing Auicen in
the.ij. can. and chap. of garlyke / says / he has proved. And also hit is
good against the bytynge of a mad dog: And a plaster made of garlyke /
fygge leaves / and co^myn / is good laid to the place bytten with a venomous
be called mugall. An oynion / as Auicen says / the.ij. can. and chap.
thereof / is eke wholesome for bytynge of a mad dog / wha^ the place bytten is
anointed with the ieuse thereof / or a plaster thereof made with falte and
rewe. And an oynio^ eaten expels the hurt of venomous things. And some
say they enge^dre in a man's stomach a moist humor very wholesome agay^st ye
hurt of venomous thy^gis. And here is to be noted / that garlike / oynions and
also lykes are not wholesome for temperate bodies / nor hot / and specially
raw. For they nourishe very little / and they nourishe ill / and engendre
sharp prickynge bludde: yet they make subtle gross humors / and break or
cut the cla^mye. And after they be sodde / they lose the prickynge / and yet
than their virtue incisiue and subtilatiue remains. Therefore they be holsomer
sodde tha^ raw. Lykes be hot and dry / Eating of lykes.
and their norishement is naught / they hurt the eyes / and engendre black
melancoly bludde / and terrable dreams: they hourte the senowes with their
prickynges: they hurt the tethe and gommes: and colerike and melancoly folks
should not use to eat them / and specially raw. Oynio^s be hot / Eating of
oynions.
and they have an erthy superfluous heat / with a wattrishe moystnes / subtle
/ undigested. If they be eaten raw they engendre ill humors / and corruptable
putrifactions in the stomach / and they cause ill dreams and dredful / and heed
ache. And if they be to much used / they mar the memory / and trouble the
understanding / and make one beside him self. But in case they be sodde with
the brothe of good flesh / and eaten / tha^ they cause good digestio^ / and
their hurtfulnes is diminished / and they moderate the coldness of meats /
where with they be sodde: Eating of garlyke.
but the best is / not to use them. Garlyke is hot / declynynge some what to
humidite / but less than oynions / hit is medicinable against ve^tositees /
and the cough / and makes one to spytte well / but hit hurts the syghte and
causes heed ache: and hit is tryacle for vplandyshe men. And thus the forsayde
things / are wholesome for them only / that have fleumatike gross and cla^my
humors / but colerike folks ought to absteyn from them. The use of nuttes.
The.ij. thing is walnuttis: whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de nuce / says: That
it with fygges and rewe / are medicinable against all manner of venom / and
thereof / of oynions / and salt is made a plaster to lay to the bytynge of a
mad dog. And this specially is understand of a dry nutte / taken before
meat / in form before said. And witteth well / that dry nuttes are worse /
than new and moist. Diseses e^gendred by eating of nuttes.
For the dry are more oylye: by reason whereof they turn to coler / and cause
heed ache / they trouble the eyes / and engendre swymmynge in the heed / and
specially taken after meat: they cause the paulsye in the tongue / and provoke
one to vomit / and make blisters in ones mouth: and they that have a colerike
stomach ought specially to eschew dry nuttis: and the older they be / the
worse they be. The new nuttis have less of ill oylynes / and therefore they
engendre not the ache or swymmynge in the heed / and such like diseases / as
the dry do: and by reason of their slippery humidite / they make one have the
laske. And if they be a littell warmed at the fire and eaten after dinner / they
press down the meat. And thus it appears ye new nuttis are more wholesome
for folks in health than dry. Of rue called herb grace.
The.iij. is rewe. Whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de ruta / says / that it
resists poison. And after he says: If one fear lest he drink poison / or
to be sto^ge of a venomous best / let him take.3.j. of the sede / with ye
leaves thereof / and dry^ke it with wine / and a nutte stamped and myngled to
gether. And Aristotell in his book de animalibus says / that when the wesill
will feyght with the edder / or the toode / she eats rewe first and sleeth
the other: For the smelle of rewe is foo to poison. The eating of rewe in the
morning with fygges and sweet almondes / preserves from venom. Here is to be
noted / yt there be.ij. kinds of rewe. ii. kyedes of rue.
The one is gardeine rewe / ye other is wild rewe. The gardeine rewe is better
than the field rewe. For the field rewe is exceeding dry. Hit is hot / and
dry in the.iiij. degree: wherefore it is hurtful to take much thereof. The
gardeyne rewe is moist hot and dry in the.ij. and.iij. degree. It perceth
and resolves ventosite / and specially / if it be dry. For Serapion in the
chap. of rewe says / that dry rewe of al medicines for ventosites is the best
/ and most wholesome: but moist it engenders ventosite. Also rewe vehemently
quickens the sight / and specially the ieuse thereof / with the ieuse of
fenell / and honye made in an oyntement orels eaten / as Auicen says in
the.ij. canon and chap. of rewe. But yet for as much as the ieuce of rewe has
a proprete hurtful to the eyes / it were best to fan wind upon your eyes
there with: and in no wise to tuche your eyes with ye material rewe. The.iiij.
is peers: Peers.
whereof Auicen.ii. can. cap. de piris / says: that they be wholesome against
mortal diseases engendered by mushroms or toode stools. For peers / sodde with
mushroms / do alaye their hurtefulnes. Orels this text may be understand by
peers aromatike / which by reason of their sweet smell / comfort the spiritis
and so repel poison. The.v. is radishes: Radyshe coolis.
whereof Auicen in his second canon / and chap. of them says: that they be
wholesome against bytynge of a snake: and dronke with wine it is good against the
bytynge of ye be cornute: and the sede thereof is good against all venomes.
And the sede of radishe laid upon a scorpion / hit sleeth him / and the water
thereof has in that behalf ben proved / and it is stronger than the sede: and
if a scorpion bite one that has eaten radishe / hit shall not hurt him. Hit
is also very good against chokynke of mushroms. Or hit may be said hit is
good against venom / because hit provoke one to vomit: and so by reason of
vomit / the stomach is purged of ill humors. And here is to be noted / that
radishe and radishe rootis are like of co^plectio^ / which are unwholesome for
colerike folk: for they engendre sharp prickynge bludde: and radishe is
unwholesome for the stomach / for hit makethe one to belche / and engenders
gross humors. And if the digestio^ be feeble / hit enge^dreth raw humors:
yet it is of a subtle and percyng nature. But some men eat radyshe after
other meatis to comfort digestion: whereat Galen maruayleth. And counnynge
physicians say / that if it be eaten after other meats / it helps digestion:
and vnlosethe the bealye. But if radishe be eaten before other meats / hit
lygftethe upward the meat / and causethe one to vomit. But it is good to
eat a small qua^tite with vinegar and salt / after other meat. Yet never the
less they hurt the eyes and the heed. Rasis.iij. Alm^. says / that radishe /
lyenge long in the stomach / void fleume / the leaves whereof digesteth meat
/ and helps the appetite / taken in a small qua^tite. The.vj. is triacle /
which of every sort is good against venom: Triacle.
and therefore hit is good both for man and beast / against venom / as well
cold as hot. And under the name of triacle the noble medicine Metridatis
may be comprehended: which.ij. be like in operation. For Auicen of triacle
says: Auice^.vi.iiii. cract. iii. cap. i.
Ye shall understand / that the greattest rule in curing of venom is to
comfort natural heat: and to labor to drive hit out / as triacle does. And
of triacle and the medicine Metridate to gether / Auice^.vi.iiii. tract. i. ca.
de med. co^mun.
Auicen says: There be certain medicines contrary to venom: which will
not suffer venom to approach nere the heart / as triacle and Metridate.

Aer sit mundus / habitabilis / ac luminosus.
Nec sit infectus / nec olens fetore cloace.
This text declares.iiij. things touching the choice of wholesome air. Of
which the first is / Choice of wholesome air.
that one ought to chose a clean air / not enfected with vapors: For
unclean aier alters ye heart after the nature of the co^plection / yt it is
myngled with / Haly. iii. (...) in co^me^to illius (...).
as Haly says. The.ij. is / one should chose light air: For dark aier
makethe a man heuye and dulle spirited: for such aier myngleth it self with
the humors in man's body / and so trubled runs to the heart: whereby of it
and of the humors / gross and troublous spiritis ben engendered / which make
one lumpyshe and slow. Therefore there is nothing makes a man more iocunde
and less heuye / than to walk in a clear aier / or to rise yerly. The.iij. is
/ that we ought to eschew infected aier / yt is where slaughter of people has
been. For commonly in those places where as great slaughter of people has been
/ and in places nere to / follows great pestilence: for when we draw in the
infecte aier / hit enfecteth the spiritis in our body. The.iiij. is / we
should eschew gunges / synkes / gutters / channels / stinkynge ditches / and
all other particular places infected with carreine / and placis where deed
carkeses or deed folks bones are cast / and places where hemp and flacce is
wattered. For aier so enfected enfecteth the spiritis of our body /
Auice^.ii.i. ^octri^^ cap* ii.
and specially hurts the brain. And therefore Auicen says / that as long
as the aier is temperate and clear / and no substance contrary to man's nature
myngled there with / hit causes and conserueth man's health. And when hit is
changed / it does contrary to the operation thereof: And for a more
declaration of the forsaide thingis / witteth well / that aier in the regiment
of health is necessary.ij. ways. First / for the refreshynge of the heart.
Secondly / for the auoidyng out of fumishe superfluites / that trouble the
spirit and natural heat. For like as we se by exterior things / the fire
without fannynge of the aier is schoked and quenched: so like wise we may
imagine that the spiritis and natural heat in man have need to norishe
conserve and attempre them. The atte^pera^ce of natural heat is caused by
drawyng of the aier / and his purgynge is caused by expulsynge of the aier. The
first is done by motion of the attraction / and the second by motion of
expulsio^. Therefore if we draw in aier stynky^ge and unclean / it corrupts
the natural heat and spirit. Therefore the aier should be of good substance /
without vapors and mistis. The aier should not be troublous and cloudy / nor
myxed with ill vapors. For such aier troubles the humors / and makes a man
heavy and sad / as is before said. The open aier would be chosen / and not
between walls or houses: and truly to speak the shut aier should de
eschewed. Yet never the less in time of pestylence / when the aier chancethe
to be enfected / the shut aier is to be chosen. Therefore at such seasons /
hit is good for us to abide within our houses / and to keep our wyndowes fast
shut / lest the putrified aier enter in: But else the open aier is best.
Farther in the regiment of health / the aier should be eschewed / which is
myxed with vapors of lakes / and deep pittis conteinynge stynkynge waters: and
of certain herbs / as cole wortes / homlockes / and such like: and of trees
/ as fygge trees and walnutte trees. Farther the aier is to be chosen / wherein
the wind blowethe from high or egall gronde. And also we ought to take good
heed / that the aier excede not in any of his first qualitees / that is in
heat / cold / moystute / and droughte / which if hit chance / hit must be
tempered by craft as much as is possible. These things Auicen teaches.ii.

St tibi serotina noceat potatio vina /
Hora matutina rebibas / et erit medicina.
This text teaches one doctrine / which is / if a man be diseased by
dry^kynge of wine over night / He must on the morrow a fresh drink wine
again. For either drinking of wine over night causes dronke^nes / thyrst in
the morning / or infla^mation of the body. If hit infla^me the body / than
hit is right unwholesome again in the morning to drink wine a fresh / for
that were to lay fire to fire: But if one hap to be drunk and there with
parbrake a little: than hit were wholesome to drink wine again a fresh in the
morning. For the drinking of wine again / than does lightly cause one to
vomit / whereby the stomach is cleansed: For by that clensynge / the hurt of
dro^kennes and parbrakynge gothe lightly away. And therefore Hippocrates
counsayleth to be dronken ones a month: that of the dronkennes may come
vomit: which thing preserves us from ill diseases of long continuance. If
drinking of wine over eve hurt one / and that by reason he is not accustomed
to drink wine: than he may drink wine in the morning / to accustom him:
and so the drinking of wine shall less hurt him. For as Hippocrates says /
Hipp. ii. aphorismo. Ex multo te^pore etc.
of a customable thing comes less grefe. But in case that thyrstynes in the
morning follows on drinking of wine over eve: than to drink water in the
morning / should cool his thirst better. For as much as we have spoken of
hurt coming by drynkynke of wine: witteth well / that a person having a
feeble brain / and eke of what so ever other condition he be / he ought most
circumspectly to beware of dronkennes. For often dronke^nes / as Auicen says:
Auic. iii.i. ca. de regi. de aque and vini. Six inco^ueniences engendered of
dronkennes.
causes.vj. inconveniences. Of whom the first is corruption of the lyuers
co^plection. For wine excessiuely taken / coming to the liver / resolves the
heat thereof: whereby the liver loses his natural generation of bludde: and instead of blud / engenders wattrishenes / causynge the dropsye / or hit
cuttethe the liver or the humors thereof / whereby lepre or wodnes is engendered.
The.ij. is / corruption of the brains complexion / through thycke and
continual assendynge of fumes of the wine thereto / disposynge the hot brain
to wodnes and frenesye: and the cold to the falling yuel / forgetfulness / and
palsy. The.iij. is weakes of the senowes. For we se that these dronkerdes / as
well in youth as in age have the palsy in ye heed / and other their me^bres.
The.iiij. is diseases of the senowes / as the crampe and palsy. For
superfluous drinking of wine / oftymes tourneth to vinegar in the stomach /
which hourtethe the senowes. Also often times / for fault of digestion / hit
tourneth in to undigested wattrishenes / which mollifieth the senowes. And
often times it enduceth gross humors to the senowes / whereby they be
stretched out / or drawn to gether. The.v. is the palsy / through humidites
of the brain / increased by the wine: so yt they stop holly the ways of the
lyfely spiritis / procedynge from the brain to the other members. The.vj. is
sodeyne death / for while the dronkerde snortethe or slepethe / his wind pipes
/ through abundance of wine / or humidites thereof engendered / are closed /
whereby he is suddenly strangled. And though the immoderate drinking of wine
causes ye forsaid inco^uenie^ses: Yet wine moderatly taken / is wholesome diverse
ways. And Auice^ in ye before allegate chap. reherseth.v. bonties of wine
moderatly drunk. The first is / ^. bonties of wine moderatly drunk.
that hit easily conueyeth ye meat / that hit is myngled with / to all the
me^bres of the body / through the heat / subtillite / and hyd convenient
proprete thereof. The.ij. is / hit digestethe fleume / and resolves hit
through the heat and subtilite of his substance / making hit apt to avoid
out / opening the ways / and co^fortynge nature to drive hit out. The.iij. is
/ hit auoydeth read color by urine / and by other insensible vacuations / as
swette and such like. And this is to be understand of claret wine / or white
/ that is feeble of his nature / or alayde with water: or else hit would
encreace coler / by tournynge it self in to coler / and infla^mation of the
liver. The.iiij. is / hit makethe melancoly / which is gross and moves
slowely / easelye to slide by hit propre pypes / from the liver to the spleen /
and from the spleen to the brymme of the stomach: and at last / with the
dregs / to avoid out of the body. And hit declineth or represseth the hurt
of mela^coly / through contrariousnes of complexion / and manner of substance /
in the effectis thereof. For melancoly enge^dreth heaviness / feintnes of heart /
and covetousness: Propreties of melancoly and of wine.
But wine engenders joy / boldness / stoutnes of stomach and liberalite.
The.v. is / hit resoluethe all causes of werynes / outcepte it be myxt with
some other heat. For wine reuiueth the resolute spiritis again abundantly /
and comfortethe natural virtue / and takes away or diminishethe humidites
left in the musculs / senowes of the heart / or in the joints. And if the
body dried by werynes / needs moystynge / wine moystethe hit quickly / so it
be alaide with water. Farther more besides these wine has many other good
propretees. For above all other things wine is a swefte and a sudden
nourisher: hit comfort the heat and natural spirit / and heteth all the
body / hit clereth the wit / appeseth anger / puts away heaviness / and
stereth to bodily lust. And no dry^ke digesteth raw humors so well. And wine
makes one manlye both in stomach and body. And they that drink no wine are
nothing in regard of their equals that drink wine / neither in stomach nor
courage.

Gignit et humores melius vinum meliores.
Si fuerit nigrum / corpus reddit tibi pigrum.
Vinum sit clarumque / vetus / subtle maturum.
Ac been limphatum saliens moderamine sumptum.
This text declarethe one doctrine of wine: and that is / the better wine is /
the better humors it enge^dreth. The cause is / for black wine is more gross
and erthie than other: therefore the spiritis thereof engendered be gross: Like
as hit is proved by Gal. saying before. Gross spiritis make the body heavy or
slow. vii. doctrines to cho^ wine.
And farther there are put.vij. doctrines touching election of wine. The first
is / the wine ought to be clear. For such wine by reason that hit is subtle /
engenders subtle and clear spiritis. The.ij. is / hit ought to be old and
not new. For new wine or must does sooner over come ones brain / and make one
have the laske / than other of the parell: hit enge^dreth the colike / and
other accidentis / that shall be declared after / when we come to / Impedit
vrinam. Nor ye should not understand / that wine ought to be to old. For
such wine / Auic. iii.i. ca. de regimine aque ^ vini.
as Auice^ says / is as a medicine / and not as drink. For such wine does
rather alter a temperate body to heat and drought / tha^ nourishe it: hit is
of small norisheme^t. For when hit is so very old / hit receives again hit
first natural verdure and sharpenes / and is than all firye: wherefore the
aggregatour / in the chap. de vite / by authorite of Galen writethe / that hit
is hot and dry in the.iij. degree. The.iij. is / that wine ought to be
subtle. For subtle wine makes the spiritis of man subtle / and gross wynes
gross spiritis. The.iiij. is / wine should be ripe / and not vert or eger /
orels hit will deprive man of all his natural vacuations and good health / as
Galen says in the co^me^t of the canon.iii. part. reg. acut. And therefore hit
is hurtefull for them / that want euacuation by urine and all other their
upper me^bres. Yet as Gal. in the same place says / such wine stypticall /
is wholesome for diseases that chance in the guts. Yet as Galen says there /
the stypticalnes of the wine would be put away by much mynglynge of water.
The.v. is / that wine should be alayde with water: For thereby the fumosite of
the wine is put away: and so overcomes the brain less. This is treuth / if
the wine be subtle / but if hit be gross / hit ouercometh the brain the
sooner: for thereby it is subtiled and made more fumyshe. And of this wine
Auicen understood when he said / Auic. ^ii.i. ca. de regimine aque et vini.
that wine alaide with water does sooner over come the brain than pure wine.
The.vj. is / wine should be sprinkelynge / wha^ one tastethe hit: and this is
one of the conditions of good wine / before said. The.vij. is / taken of the
drynkers condition / and not of the wine: that is / we must drink wine
te^perately: For wine temperatly taken / sharpeth the wit / and enge^dreth
all the wholesome things before declared. By all these. things here expressed
we may conclude / that wine most to be chosen and best in the regiment of
health is mean wine / egall between old and new / clear / some what read /
of good odor and flauour / of egall savor / that is neither eger / sharp /
nor sweet: which is not gross / nor to much subtle: and eke that hit be not
to strong nor to weak: and that hit grow not on stony and hylly ground /
nor on simble plain and earable ground / but on high ground / lyenge open
toward the southe / in a country not to hot nor to cold. And these things
are partly gathered out of Gal. iij.j. the place before allegate. Touching the
regiment of wine / concerning the ages / the rules that Auicen puts in ye
above allegate place / are to be noted. The first is / to give children wine to
dry^ke / is as one laid fire to fire of dry wodde. For children be tender and
soon enflamed / through thabunda^ce of their natural heat / and their
senowes and brain be weak and feeble. Wherefore wine hurts them many ways.
First by quick infla^mation / by strykynge of the brain / by lightly percynge
of the senowes / and abundant fumosite. Therefore when one gyuethe wine to
children to drink / the flamynge heat of the wine is added to ye flamynge
heat of children bodies / which is of small resistance / as dry styckes /
reeds / or towe is against the fire. The.ij. rule is / that one give an old
man as much wine to drink as he can bear without hurt / that is / as much
as his natural and due appetite desires. For like as old bootis and buskyns
that be dry and wrynkeled / are made soupull and plain with oil / like wise
ben the bodies of old folks by drinking of chosen wine / as wine of Beuuois.
Ancient folks are cold / and wine heateth / their spirit is heavy / and they
be fulle of melancolye: but wynes makes them merry / and represseth
mela^colyes: and commonly old folks sleep ill / but wine makethe them to
sleep well. They be prone to opilations / but wine opens and lets them.
And so / like as wine to children is most contrary / so for old folks hit
is most wholesome. The.iii. is / that yo^ge folks drink wine temperatly /
temperately is / touching measurable quantite / and convenient alayenge with
water. And al though yo^ge folks are as hot as children / yet they have
their me^bres more sound / the senowes and brain more strong / whereby they
may the stronglyer resist the hurt of wine drinking. There follow many good
things of drinking wine sobrely / that is to say / the voidynge of coler /
the quickenynge of the corporal might and wit / and the abundance of subtle
spiritis.

Non sit acetosa ceruisia / sed been clara /
De validis cocta granis satis ac veterata.
This text declares.v. things to chose good ale by. First that hit be not
sower / for that hurts the stomach. A sower thing / as Auicen says in many
places / hurts the senowes / for ye stomach is a member full of senowes / and
that is touching the brynke. The.ij. is that ale must be clear: for troubled
ale is a stopper / and hurtethe them over much that have the stone / hit
fattethe and enflatethe and makes one short wynded / and engenders much
fleme. The.iij. is / ale should be made of good corn not corrupt / that is to
say of the best barley / wheat or ^otis: for the better ye corn is / the
better is the humor thereof engendered. The.iiij. is / that ale ought to be
well sodde: for it is the better digested / and more amiably received of
nature: and the inco^uenie^tis thereof growyng / are the better borne. For ale
not well sodde engenders ve^tosites in the bealy / gnawynge / inflasio^ / and
colike. The.v. is / ale ought to be stale and well purged / and not over new.
For new ale engenders the same hurt that ale does that is not well sodde: and
there with most easilye causes the strain coilion.

De qua potatur / stomacus non inde grauetur. Here is taught one lesson
touching ye use of ale. That we must drink it moderatly / so that the stomach
be not hurt thereby / nor dro^kennes caused. For hit is worse to be drunk of
ale than of wine / and longer dureth: the fumes and vapors of ale that ascend
to the heed are gross / wherefore they be not so resoluable / as they that be
mo^ted up by wine. Where upon it is to be noted / that in the beginning of
dinner or soupper / hit is holsomer to drink ale before wine: the cause is /
for at ye beginning of our repast or dinner / the body is hungrye: so ye stomach
before we began to eat meat was hungrye / and so drew superfluites from the
me^bres. Therefore if we begin with wine / for that nature greatly desirethe
hit / for the great norisheme^t thereof: the superfluites / to gether with ye
wine drawn of the stomach / are drawn to the parties of the body: but nature
so desirously draws not ale. Like wise ale washes ye humors ha^gynge about
the brymme of the stomach. And for this cause physicians counsel / that when
one is most hungrye he should first assay to vomit or he eat any meat /
that those superfluites drawn to gether of the hungrye stomach / may be voided
out / lest they be myngled with the meat. Like wise he that fears to be
thyrsty by superfluous drinking of water / should drink ale: For it que^cheth
unnatural thyrste.

Here is determined what qua^tite of meat should be eaten / Diete after
the.iiii. seasons of the year.
after the diversity of the.iiij. seasons of ye year / which are ver or
spring time / summer / autumn / and winter. He says that in the time of ver
/ we must eat littell meat. The same wylleth Auicen / and shows the reason
why / because / Auice^. ii.i. doct. ii. ca. vi. and.iii.i. doct. v. de reg.
tp^m cum recti auris.
says he / in winter man's body is not greatly given to labor and exercise /
through prohibution of resolution / raw humors are increased / and specially
fleumatike: which after the proportion of the season / tha^ specially be
engendered: which humors by reason of cold / are enclosed in the body. But
wha^ ver or spryngetyme comes / it causes these raw humors / gethered to
gether / to melte and sprede through all the body: wherefore nature is than
greatelye occupied in digestynge of them. Therefore in ver season / if one eat
much meat / hit lets nature to digeste such fleumatike humors / and
should be diuerted an other way: for by these humors and great qua^tite of
meat nature should be over pressed. And so such humors should remain in the
body undigested: and runnynge to some membre / should cause some disease there.
And therefore we ought to take good head / that we eat no greatte quantite of
meat in ver. For diminishion of meat in this season / is a special
preservation from diseases reynynge in ver / as Auicen says.ij.j. the place
before allegate. And this saying is of a truth / from the mids to the end
of ver / and not in the beginning: for the beginning of ver is lykened to
winter: wherefore than one may norishe the body as well as in winter. And this
also may be understand when vere find the body full of humors / than meat
is to be given after the natural heat and resolution / that is caused of the
body: for than the cause is avoided: for which meat should be diminished. And
the same wills Hipp. j. aphorismoru^ / where he says: Bealies in winter and
vere are most hot / and sleep most long. Therefore in those seasons / for
the natural heat is much: therefore hit needs larger norishement. Secondly
he says / that to eat to much meat in somer is hurtefull: because than the
virtue of digestion is feeble: For the spiritis and natural heat / which are
the instumentes of corporal operation / are than right feeble / sparcled / and
resolute / through outward heat / vehemently drawyng them to the exterior
partis: and contrary wise / much meat can not be digested. And here is to be
noted / that for the vehement resolution of humidites / as well substa^ciall /
as mutrymentall of the body / grosser and more meat in so^mer should be eaten
/ if the night digestive could digeste so much meat: but because nature can
not digeste much at ones / we must eat a little / and often: The reason that
one ought to eat little meat in summer.
as Galen says in the co^me^t of this Canon / Et quibus semel aut bis etc. In
so^mer we must eat many times and little: many times because the body has
need through often dissolution: a little / for defaute of digestion. And al
though littell meat should be eaten in the summer / yet one may drink much:
for than is greatter resolution and drought of the body: and the natural heat
of the body excedeth the moisture thereof: and man is more thyrsty than / than
other times. But yet than one ought to drink less wine / specially if hit be
pure / for such wine soon enflameth / and causes the natural heat / hatte
by the ardent heat of so^mer / to burn / and therefore if we drink wine / we
must myngle hit with much water: and we must forbear old and strong wine.
Thyrdly he says / To avoid eating of fruits in Autu^ne.
that in Autu^ne we ought to beware of fruits / specially of ye same season /
as grapis / peches / figgis / and such like: or at least to eat but littell
of them / for such frutis engendre bludde / apt to putrify / through the
boyllyng that they make in the body and humors: and specially if they be
received in to an unclean stomach / or a corrupt body / which for the most
part chances in autumn. And so than / ill and fylthy diseases are engendered /
as the pockes and other pestilent sickenesses. Yet for a farther knowledge of
the regiment of meat and drink in Autumn / wytteth well / that in harvest /
hunger and thyrste should be eschewed / and to eat much meat at one meal:
as Rasis.iij. Alm^ says / cap. de reg. corporis secundum tp^s. The wine also
that is drunk in harvest / should be alayde with much water / that hit may
moist the body / and cole the heat: but not so superfluously alayde with
water than / as in so^mer: nor to be than drunk so superfluouslye: for tha^
nature febled / is not able to welde and digeste it: and to much alayenge with
water / would distroye natural heat / and encreace ve^tosites: whereby ye
colike may be engendered. Fourthly he says / yt in winter we may eat as
much as we will / that is to say / more tha^ in other seasons / after the
mind of Auicen in.iij.j. the place before allegate. And Galen says / in the
canon of the aphoris. E^ quibus semel aut etc. In winter much meat leiserly
should be eaten. The reason is because the heat of our body in winter is
strongest / both by reason hit is conieled to gether / and fortified / by
position of his contrary / that is to say / the coldness of the aier /
enuironynge our bodies about. And this is verified in bygge bodies and fleshie
/ and not in bare and feeble: for on such bodies coldenes of winter inclined
does not comfort with heat / but feblethe them more: For in winter as
Hippocrates says: bealies be hottest of nature and sleep most long. Hit
follows / that the grosser norishementis and harder of digestion are holsomer
in winter than in other seasons / by cause the heat is stronger. But the wine
that we must drink than ought to be ruddye as a rose / and not white / and
alayde with a little water. Here is to be noted / that all though / through
the strength of heat / and virtue of digestion in winter / the gross and
strong meatis are holsomer: yet because the seasons than are disposed to
opilations and repletions / through very much fleme / hit were wholesome than
to use mean meats / between heavy and light / gross and subtle / as kydde /
veale / mutton / pikes / perch / and creuesses. And they that use grosser
meats / as befe / porke / venson / gottis flesh / and such like / should
eat but one meal a day: orels to use meatis laxatiue / as persly / cressis /
mustert / and such like / and to use great labor.

Here are put.ij. remedies against ill drink. Herbs wholesome to put in drink.
The first is sage / the leaves whereof put in to the drink fordothe the hurt
of hit / with it proprete / and also hit comfort the senowes and brain:
which comforted / resist the better the ill fumes / that of the ill drink
ascend there unto. The.ij. is rue / whose leaves holle without any brusynge /
should be put in to the drink / for with hit heat and proprete / it fordoth
the malice of the drink. And how good rue is against poison / hit has been
declared before at / Allea nux / tuta etc. And this text says / to the.ij.
forsayde herbs / we may put the rose flower. And this specially should be
understand of a red rose: for the sweet smell and stipticalnes thereof /
amendeth the malice of the drink.

Nausea non poterit quemquam vexare marina.
Aurea cum vino mixtam si sumpserit illam.
A remedy for parbrakynge on the sea.
Here is put a remedy to avoid parbrakynge or spuynge / for such as are not
accustomed to pass the sea. He that will pass the sea / must a few days
before he take shyppynge / myngle the sea water with his wine. This is a
remedy for the rich: but if hit be a poor man / than he must drink see
water / that he may easelyer eschew spuynge. The reason hereof is / because
the sea water is salt: and so with his saltnes and stipticite / that follows
saltnes / it closes the mouth of the stomach / and thereby fordothe spuynge.
And here is to be noted / that as Auicen says / a trauayler on the sea /
Auic. iii.i. de reg. iter agentis in mari.
should not much go about to withsta^de or to forbear parbrakynge or spuynge
/ at the beginning / but to vomit / until he think him self well purged:
for that preserves from many diseases / and not only preserves / but also
heals or alleuiateth grievous and great diseases / as lepre / dropsye / palsy
/ coldness and swellynge of the stomach. Thus says Auicen.iii.i. doct. ii. ca.
ii. But in case that the trauailer on the sea spue so much / that he thereby is
right greatly febled / he must^ than restrain hit by eating fruit stypticall
and sower / as ben unripe fruit / crabbes / sower pomegarnades and such like:
wherewith the mouth of the stomach is comforted / and humors expelled down:
and also the stomach thereby comforted / driuethe away humors flowynge there
unto by tossinge of ye water. Orels we may take musterte sede dried by the fire
/ and drink hit with wine / or wormewode may be eaten or dronken / or a toste
wette in redolent wine is good to eat. And generallye tarte meats be good for
trauaylers on the sea / for they comfort the stomach / and prohibit vapors
and fumes to asce^de to the heed / as herbs sodde in vinegar / or in the ieuse
of sower grapes.

Saluia / sal / vinum / piper / allea / petrocilium.
Ex his fit salsa / nisi sit co^mixio falsa.
This text teaches us to make a common sauce if we lack a better. To make a
common sauce.
And.v. things goth to the making of this sauce. The first is sage. Wherewith
we may make sauce for a goose roste or sodde. For commonly a goose roasted or a
pygge is stopped with sage / to draw up the humidites and cla^mynes of them /
and also because the flesh should smell some what thereof: yet after it is
roasted / the sage should be cast away and not eaten. Like wise of sage
vplandyshe folk make a sauce to eat with a goose: for they stamp sage and
garlyke to gether / that the sage may abate some what of the garlykes savor.
The.ij. is salt with wine: and this sauce is for rich and noble men. For when
they want mustert / or ver ieuse / they put wine in a saucer / and myngle hit
with a little salt. The.iij. is peper / vplandyshe folks sauce. For they
myngle peper with beans and peasen. Like wise of breadde tosted / with ale or
wine / and with peper they make a black sauce / as it were pappe / that is
called peper / and that they cast upon their meat flesh and fysshe. The
fourth is garlyke / where of the vplandishe people make a sauce: for they
myngle soft chese and milk / and stamp garlyke to gether / and so eat hit
with their meat / whether it be roste or sodde / salt or fresshe / and with
hard eggs. The.v. is perslye: the leaves whereof sta^ped / with ver ieuse or
white wine is made a grene sauce to eat with roste meat. And here is to be
noted / that sauce or sauces vary after the seasons. For in hot seasons / hit
must be made of cold things / or of stuff of little heat / and in cold
seasons contrary wise. Therefore summer sauce should be ver ieuse / or eysell /
or vinegar / the ieuse of le^mons / or of pome garnades with rose water and
such like. And other while in sauces made in so^mer / one may put a little
pellitorie and persly / to attempre the coldenes of the forsayde things. But
the mattier of co^petent sauces in winter are musterte / carloke / gynger /
peper / cynomum / gelofers / garlyke / sage / myntes / pelitorie / and perslye:
wine water of flesh / vinegar not to strong / but very nere to the nature of
wine: And in mean seasons / they should be mean / neither to hot nor to
cold. Secondlye sauces differ by reason of the meats for which they be made:
for one meat will have one sauce / an other meat a another sauce: as lordis
cokes know. Sauce for mutton / veale and kydde is grene sauce / made in so^mer
with vinegar or ver ieuse / with a few spices / without garlyke / with persly
/ white gynger / ver ieuse / and tosted breadde with vinegar. In winter the
same sauces be made with many spices / and a littell qua^tite of garlyke / and
of the best wine / and with a littell ver ieuse / or with mustert. Sauce for
roasted befe is made with peper / tosted breadde / brothe of flesh and grapes.
And the same sauce is good in winter to eat with porke. Also porke in summer
may be eaten with vinegar and perslye in the beginning of our repast. But in
case / the forsayde meats be baked / and specially befe and porke / in winter
/ than serve in a white oynion / and a small qua^tite of sweet spice beaten in
powder. But in so^mer without oynions / and with ver ieuse / orels with a few
small oynions. But if the pastis be made of more tender flesh and light of
digestion / serve in there with no oynions: but in so^mer almon milk with ver
ieuse / and a little blanch powder: and at the last ye may put thereto / an
egg broken with ver ieuce. But in winter instead of ver ieuse take wine / and
more spice. With roasted rabbattis and chekyns / sauce made with cynomume /
Diverse good sauces for sundry meats
cru^mes of breadde / and with ver ieuse in so^mer is wholesome / and in winter
with wine. For roasted porke take of the dryppynge / tempered with good wine and
oynions in winter: and in summer take the grene sauce above named. For roasted
fesantes / pigions / and turtyls / take none other sauce but salt. For boylde
capons and cocks take of the same brothe with a little bla^che powder. And
precisely if they be boiled with sage / Isope / and persly / this is good sauce
in winter: and in so^mer / the brothe of the capon / and a little vergis
myngled to gether is a wholesome sauce. For fat capons and he^nes baked / serve
in none other sauce / but a small quantite of blanch powder: and at the end
the above named grene sauce in so^mer / and in winter good wine. But fish the
grosser it is / the harder of digestion / the more superfluous / and moyster of
nature / the more hit needs hot sauces and sharp: and the same rule is like
wise true in all manner of flesh.

Si fore vis sanus ablue sepe manus
Lotio post mensam tibi confert munera bina
Mundificat palmas / and lumina reddat acuta.
Here are declared.ij. wholesome things that come by washing of our hands
after meat. The first is / the palm of our hands are mundified. The.ij. is /
our sight is sharped there by / and that is specially by accidens / for the
hands be ye instrume^tis to cleanse the eyes: and hit is right wholesome for them
to be mundified: whereof we have before spoken at Lumina mane manus.

This text touches.ij. things concerning the choice of breadde. The first
is heat. For bread ought not to be eaten hot. Eating of hot bread
Hot bread is hurtful to man's nature: as Auicen says.ii. ca. de pane. Hot
bread is not convenient for man's nature: and bread that comes hot from the
oven is unwholesome. The reason is / because it stops much. And again after
he says: Hot bread through hit heat causes thyrstynes: and swymmeth by
reason of his vapourous humidite: and is of quick digestion / and of slow
discence. And all though hot breadde in the regiment of health be unwholesome
to eat / yet ye smell thereof is right wholesome / hit relyuethe one in a sownde:
and hit is possible / that some folks may live by the smelle of new breadde.
The.ij. is / we ought not to eat breadde very stale / or moldy: for such
breadde is unwholesome for the nourishement of man's nature: for it driethe the
body / and engendrethe melancoly humors: whereon hit folowethe / that bread
should not be to new nor to stale / but a day old. Farther the text
declarethe.v. propretes of good breadde. v. propretes of good bread.
The first / hit must be well leuende / as Gal.i. alimentorum / ca. ii. says:
The best breadde for digestion / is hit that is very well leuende / and baked
in an oven hatte with moderate fire. And again in the same chap. he says:
Vnleuende bread is wholesome for no body. And after the mind of Auicen / Breadde
made with littel leven / Auicen.ii. can. cap. de pane.
nourishethe much / but the norishement thereof is a stopper / outcepte they
eat it / that labor much. The.ij. is / that bread ought to be light / for
thereby is known / that the cla^mynes is goone. Yet never the less this bread
/ after the mind of Auicen / in the chap. and place before said / is a swefte
entrer / and of less and worse nourisheme^t / as bread is / made of much
branne. The.iij. is / that bread ought to be well baked: for breadde ill baked
is of ill digestion / and engendrethe grefe in the stomach. And Auicen in the
forsaide canon and chap. says: That the bread ill baked / norisheth very much
/ but the norishement causes opilations / outcepte they labor much that eat
it. And bread baken on a stone or in a pan is of the same fashion: for hit is
never well baked with in. The.iiij. is / that bread ought to be temperately
salted. For bread over sweet is a stopper / and over salt a dryer. But bread
moderately salted norisheth best / so it have the other conditions. The.v. is
/ that it should be made of the best grain / that is to say / of ye best
wheat. More over the text warnethe us to beware of crustis eating: for they
engendre adust coler / or melancolye humors / by reason they be burned and
dry. And therefore great estates / which of nature be colerike / cause the
crustis above and benethe to be chypped away. Wherefore the pithe or the cru^me
should be chosen / which is of more and swyfter norysheme^t than the cruste.
Yet not withstanding crustis are wholesome for them that be holle / and have
their stomach moist / and desire to be lean / but they must eat them after
they have dyned. For they enforce the meat to discende / and comfort the
mouth of the stomach. Farther / in the.ij. and last verses is mentioned /
that good bread ought to have these.v. conditions / that is / ye hit be salted
/ leuende / well baked / made of good corn / that is / that ye corn be pure /
reapt / gethered / shefte / and housed in due season. And these conditions
Auicen reme^breth in the forsayde place / saying: Hit behooves that bread be
pure / salted / leuende / well baked / and a day old. And here is to be noted
/ that if one desire to norishe his body / he must have his breadde made of
pure flower / the branne clean taken out: if one will be leaner / leave some
branne therein. For branne norishethe but little / and vnlosethe the bealye /
and flower does contrary wise.

Est caro porcina sine vino peior ouina.
Si tribuis vina / tunc est cibus medicina.
Here in this text porke is compared to mutton. If porke be eaten without wine
it is less wholesome than mutton / but porke eaten with wine / nourishethe best
/ and it is medicinable: for hit moysteth much. And is to be understand
specially of roasted pigs / and braune well dyghte. And here is to be noted /
that porke / salted / or dried in the smoke / such as men of the country use
/ called bakon / are in no manner wise so wholesome as mutton / whether hit be
eaten with wine or no: but hit is understand by roasted porke / or pigge / or
braune / as is before said.

Ilia porcorum bona sunt / mala sunt reliquorum. This text says / that hog
tripes / be better than of other beastis. The reason is / by cause we eat few
entrayles / outcepte they be full of blud / and of very fat beastis / as
hogs be. Now only hoggis bludde / through the complexion / and similitude of
complexion with man's nature / is bludde / of which the bowels be filled. And
like wise hoggis be sooner fat / than any other bestis. Therefore we eat
rather the tripes and chitterly^ges of an hog than of other bestis.

Impedit vrinam mustum / soluit cito ventrem.
Epatis infraxim splenis / generat lapidemque.
This text opens.v. inco^uenie^ces / that grow by drinking of new wine or
must. The first is / that must lets the urine: and this may be
understand.ij. ways. First / for gross must / through his grosnes / myxed
with the dregs / stoppethe the liver and the raynes / so that the urine can
not easily have hit course. Secondly / hit lettethe the urine of hit due course
/ as some reinnyshe must does / and certain other subtle wynes like wise:
For there is some reynnyshe must / that whose lies are mordica^t or bytynge:
and while hit runs in to the bladder the erthye lies byte and prick the
bladder: and co^strayne one to piss contrary to the due order and manner that
he was wont to do. The.ij. is / hit losethe the bealye / by reason that hit
scoureth the entrayles / and through the sharpnes of hit lies / hit pricketh
the guttis to void out the ordeurs: first / through mordicatenes of the lies.
Secondly through ve^tosite / which such wine causethe. Thyrdlye / by reason
hit makes ye guttis slyppry / by way of vndigestiblenes / and grefe of the
stomach / wherefore the stomach leuseth / and openethe the ways that were
shut. The.iij. is / that must hurtethe the good co^plection of the liver:
For hit stops the liver through much mynglynge of hit lies: and causes
disease in the liver called dissenteria / through swellynge / whereby ye liver
is febled. Thus says Auicen.iii.i. ca. de reg. aque and vini. And thus it
enge^drethe an ill color / and ill diseases of the liver / that is to say
spices of ye dropsy. The.iiij. is / that must hurtethe the spleen and
disposition thereof / through the same cause that hit does the liver: for hit
stops the spleen: and so causethe it to be hard. The.v. is / that must
enge^dreth the stone: and specially that is in the reins: which is ruddy /
and lightly frangyble / by reason of opilation / that hit causes by hit gross
substance. And this is certain if the must be of very sweet wynes / whose
lies be nothing bytynge or sharp. For must / that has sharp and bytynge
lies / preserves a man from the stone: for hit makethe one to pysse often: as
some reinyshe must / that causethe sand or grauel to be seen in the urine:
often provoking one to make water: which often making of water / wassheth away
the small gravel / that cleueth to a man's raynes / and so auoydeth hit.

Potus aque sumptus / sit edenti valoe nociuus.
Infrigidat stomachum. cibum nititur fore crudum.
Here are declared.ij. hurtes / hurtis that comme by drinking of water.
that come by drinking of water. The first is / that drinking of water
hurts ones stomach that eats: by reason that water cools and leusethe the
stomach: and specially hit distroyeth the appetite. The.ij. is / that drinking
of water with meat lettethe digestio^ / for it makes ye meat received
rawyshe. After the mind of Auicen / Auic. iii.i. ca. de reg. eiu^ / quod
comeditur. Auic ca. de regi. aque et vini.
saying: Nor after meat / much water should not be dronken: For hit deuideth
the stomach and the meat / and causes hit to swymme in the stomach. And he
says: And when nature does digeste meat / and that sufficient qua^tite of
water be myngled therewith / than after that / if we drink more water / hit
lets very much the digestion that was begone. And again Auicen says:
Auicen. ii. can. tract. i. cap. iiii.
that drinking of water should be eschewed / outcepte hit be to help the
meat down / when hit stycketh or discendeth slowelye. But with meat water
should never be taken or used. Auerrois in his comment shows the reason /
when we receive water upon meat / hit makes the stomach cold or it be
through hot: and makes the meat rawyshe: and eke causes the meat to swym
in the stomach: and hit is the cause: that the meat stycketh not fast there as
it should digest / as hit conveniently should. The operation of the stomach is
/ to make a good myxion of things received there in / and to digest them well.
That done there follows an ordinary / and a natural separation of pure and
vnpure things. And as a greatte quantite of water put in a pot slakethe the
sythynge of the meat therein: so like wise hit chances in the stomach / by
drinking of much water: But to drink a little quantite of cold water /
with our meat / before it descend down in to the stomach / is not forbidden
but allowable / specially if we be very thyrsty: for a littel qua^tite of cold
wat / taken after ye forsayde manner / easethe the stomach and quenchethe
thyrste. The coldness of the water enforcethe the heat of man to desce^de to
the very bottum of the stomach / and so fortifieth the digestion thereof. Thus
says Auice^ in the above allegate placis. But witteth well / that though water
be more convenient to quench thyrste than wine: yet wine for a man's health is
more wholesome than water. And though water universally quench thyrste better
than wine / because hit is cold and moist / yet to make natural and good
co^mixion of meats / and to co^ueie them to the extreme partis of man's body /
wine is better tha^ water. For wine through his subtle substance and operation
/ myngleth it self better with the meat / than water does: and nature
delyteth more in wine than in water: therefore the me^bres draw wine more
sooner unto them / mynglynge hit with the meat. This mixynge in this manner is
as a boylynge or sethyng of things to gether: which is greatly help by the
heat of the wine: but warer with hit coldness / lets hit. So than it
appears / that wine in mynglynge with meat and delatynge of the same / is
better than water. For wine / by reason of hit subtilite of substance / and
virtuous heat is a marvelous percer. And so by consequens wine delateth or
spreads more tha^ water / wherein is no virtuous heat / nor substance of air
nor fire: the water lets ye passage thereof. Farther / water is not so
wholesome drink as wine: for water hyndrethe the norishement of the body: by
reason hit nouryshethe very little or nothing at all: So that the more
wattrysshe that meat is / the less hit norisheth. Therefore hit is very
wholesome to drink wine with our meat: for hit does not hinder norishement /
but greatly fordreth hit: for wine is a special norisheme^t and restoratiue /
and norisheth sweftely / as hit is before said. Farther / ye shall understand /
that to dry^ke water with meat / is not only hurtful / but also in many other
cases / Auic. iii.i. ca. de regimine aque ^ vini.
which are declared of Auicen. First hit is unwholesome for a man to dry^ke
fasting: for hit perceth in to the body by all the principal members thereof:
mortifienge hit natural heat. This is of truth / if one that is truly
fasting drink hit. Yet for a dronken man / it is some time wholesome: nor it
hurts him not / though he dry^ke hit fasting: For a dronkerde fasting is
not utterly fasting / his stomach is not vacande / but some what remains of
the other days ingurgynge. But in whose nitrosite / water drunk in ye
morning does mitigate: and the stomach / there with washed / and the vapors
and fumes repressed / is disposed to receive new sustinance. The.ij. hurt is
to drink water after great labor and travail: and like wise after the
fleshely act / between man and woman: For than the poris of the body be very
open: whereby the water entrethe in to the bottum of the members / mortifienge
the natural heat. Which heat also after the fleshely act is weaked.
The.iij. inconvenience is after baynyng / specially / if one bayne him
fasting: for than the cundites and ways of the body be very open: wherefore
the water entering in hurts / as is before said. Auice^.v^. quarti / s^ma.ii.
ca. vltimo.
Of this drinking of water Auicen says: That of water drunk tastynge / after
baynynge / and after carnal copulation / corruptynge of co^plection and dropsy
is to be feared. Fourthly / it is hurtful to drink cold water to que^che
feyned thyrst / in the night / as hit chances to surfetters and dro^kerdes:
For by drinking of cold water / the resolution and digestion of salt humors
are prohibited / whether it be of wine or other sharp things / causynge
thyrste: and so sone after drink thyrste comes again / as stronglye as
before. But in case the thyrste be so vehement / vexynge and vnquietynge over
much / that neither coldenes of brethynge / nor washing of the mouth with
cold water / can suffice / than let the thyrstie dry^ke cold water / out of a
narowe mouthed vesselle or cup / or syppynge / that the water more slowlye
may come unto the brymme of the stomach: for so hit shall best quench
thyrste / and less thereof shall be drunk / and than it shall not utterly
distroy digestion. Fyftelye / generallye / hit is ill for holle folks to
drink much cold water / for hit quenches natural heat / greueth the
breast / marreth the appetite of the stomach / and is very hurtful to all the
senowye me^bres. Yet never the less water temperatly cold some time per
accidence / stereth one to have an appetite / and makes the stomach strong /
helping hit / opening and clensynge the ways thereof.

Sunt nutratiue multum arnes vituline. Here the author says that veale
nourishes very much. And this Auicen affirms / saying / that meat that
conserueth health must be such as the flesh is. For they are of like nature /
and very apt to be converted in to bludde: and specially kydde / young
suckynge calves / and yerelynge lammes. And this veale Galen.iii. alimentorum /
The best veale.
preysethe highlye / saying / that veale of.vj. or.viij. wekes old roasted /
is more wholesome than mutton / hit is soon digested / and norisheth very much.
And of these fleshes we have spoken before.

Sunt bona gallina / capo / turtur / sturna columba
Quiscula vel merula phasianus / ethigoneta.
Perdix / frigellus / orex / tremulus / amarellus.
The best fowls to eat.
This text shows what wild foul are most wholesome to eat / to nouryshe
man's nature. The nombre of them is.xiiij. The first is an hen: the which is
very wholesome to eat. For Haly / Auenzoart / and Mesue say / that the best
flesh of pultry is an hen / that never laid / and of a cock / yt never
trad hen. For they without superfluite are soon turned in to bludde: their
proprete is to tempre man's complexion: and their broth is the best medicine
that can be for lepers. And Galen says / Galen. ii. can. ca. de g^inis ^ gallo.
that flesh of young pullettes / augme^teth intellection / hit clereth the
voice / and encreaceth the sede of generation. The.ij. is a capon / whose
flesh consiliator / in his.lxviij. question / nombreth among the most
wholesome fleshes. And these fleshes / and like wise the other before said / the
stomach of hit proprete / does digest. The.iij. is a turtyll / which also
nourishes well / and engenders good blud. Auicen.ii. can. ca. d^ cane.
The flesh whereof Auicen highlye preysethe / saying: There is no fowls
flesh better tha^ a turtyls or a hens / nor subtiler. But yet they are not
so nouryshynge as the pertriche. The.iiij. after the opinion of some is a
stare. This bird should be eaten young. Some other call this foul Starna:
which Rasis.iij. Alm^ preisethe above al other fowls / saying: A sterlyngis
flesh is lyghtest of all other fowls / and wholesome for them that will keep a
sklender diete: and by this may be understand a greatter foul / as a gray
goose / the flesh whereof / is right commendable / specially young. And on this
wise Almans. understands / preferrynge this flesh before other. Orels by a
stare may be understand / certain small pertriches: whereof Moses seems to
understand / saying to the Jews: Like wise stares are unwholesome for our
king / for they co^streyne and indurate the bealye. And this proprete some
ascribe unto pertriches. For their flesh bind the bealy / as witnessethe
Rasis.iij. Alm^. The.v. is a dove / whose flesh is colerike. Which / as Rasis
says / is exceeding hot: the which enge^dreth blud ferue^tly hot / and
lightly enge^dreth the ague. And therefore pigions be better baked with sower
grapis / than roasted. For by the sower grapes / the heat engendered in the
bludde is alayde. And the best to eat be young pigions / redye to fly / for
such be of light digestion / and of better humor. For yo^ge pigions / not
able to flee / are superfluously hot and moist: whereby they enge^dre gross
humors / as Auicen says the.ij. canon / and chap. of pigions. But old
pigions and their flesh / for their over great heat / drought / and
difficulte of digestion / are to be eschewed. And like wise old turtyls.
The.vj. is a quayle. Some doctors say that a quayle is of light substance /
and engenders good bludde: and is very wholesome for holle folks. But after the
mind of Isaac / quayles are worse than any other wild foul: nor they for
nourishement nor digestion ought to be preysed. For through eating of their
flesh the crampe is to be feared. As Auicen says.ii. can. cap. de cotur. And
he says the reason is in the substance of their flesh / that they engendre
the crampe. And for this reason french me^ bake and eat quayles with soft
buttry chese. Yet by the quayle may be understand an other bird a little
more than the foresaid pertriche / of the same color / with read feet and
bylle / of a delicious savor. And on this wise Rasis.iij. Alm^ takes a quayle
/ wha^ he prefers ye flesh thereof above the flesh of a stare / and all
other fowls. The.vij. is an osell: which like wise should be eaten young.
The.viij. is a phesande: which of all physicians is no^bred for one of the
best fleshes. For the flesh of that foul is most wholesome for man's nature:
and it is meat for princis and great estates. Consiliator says / that the
wild fesante is best / both for health and strength. And also perauenture
universally / saying yt they are nere like unto he^nes / and welnere of the
same shappe. And they be drier of air and of fedynge / and larger of exercise.
The.ix. is a wodcocke / the flesh of this bird is specially wholesome. The.x.
is a pertriche: whose flesh as Auicen says / is subtle / Auicen.ii. can. ca.
de cubigine. Gale^.iii. alime^toru^. cap. xvii. et.xviii. de iugenio cap. ii.
and a great fatter / hit scoureth away the dropsye / comfort the stomach /
and augmenteth carnal lust. Yet never the less it is a bynder. And this flesh
Galen prefers above all other. And hit is said that customable eating of
this flesh / comfort the memory. The.xj. is a ruddocke / called robyn red
breast / she eatethe grapis / and fleethe sweftly as a stare does / but hit
nourishethe better than a stare does: and they hau^te much about the vines /
and they be drunk by eating of grapes / and they be best in season to eat
about al Halomas. The.xij. is orex / which as some say is a fesant hen / and
as some say a more hen: whether hit be a phesant hen or a more hen / the
flesh is of good norisheme^t. The.xiij. is a bird called tremulus: which
bird commonly abides nere the sea cost / less in quantite than a hen / in
color russet / hit criethe loud and fleethe sweftelye / and when his plumeth
upon the earth / the tail waggeth still / and therefore hit is called tremulus
/ and upon the heed thereof grows long feathers. Hit is not that bird / ye
phesitions call a wagge tail. The.xiiij. and last / is amarellus: which also
is a water foul / like unto a ducke / but hit is less. And to speak
generally / among fowls to eat / they be best preysed / that be swyfter in
flight. And as the flesh of the forsaide fowls are of a co^me^dable
norisheme^t / and of easy digestion: so like wise the flesh of some fowls is
of a disco^mendable nourishement / hard to digest / and of unequal co^plection
/ as the flesh of geese / pecockes / and malardes / and universally of al
fowls / that have long necks / long bylles / and live upon water. And the
flesh of sparowes / which are exceeding hot / and vnte^perate / sterynge to
bodily lust. But touching election of fowls flesh / ye shall understand /
that their natural norishynge must be considered / that is whether they be
restoratiue / light of digestion / light of substance / or of subtle
operation: and so after their diverse propretes to preyse them. Wherefore Galen
beholdynge the easy alteration and subtilte of pertriches flesh / prefers
them. But Rasis with Isaac / co^siderynge the subtilte and lightness of the
stare / preysethe that best. Isaac also after the diverse inte^tions of wild
fowls flesh / preyseth diverse. Auicen commendethe turtyls flesh above other:
either having respect to the proprete / whereby it strengtheth and comfort
ma^s understanding: orels yt in the country of Araby / where Auicen was borne
/ turtyls are better than in other countries. Farther wittethe well / that
flesh of fowls is more wholesome / than of.iiij. legged beastis / for them that
forsake labor / and give them to study and co^templation / for hit is sooner
digested: as Galen.iij. alimentoru^ says: yet this flesh of fowls is sooner
digested than of beastis / and specially of pertriches / which engenders
clean and pure bludde: disposed to augme^t and to sharp the operations of the
brain / that is ma^s understanding / cogitation / and memory.

Si pisces molles sunt / magno corpore toll
Si pisces duri parui sunt plus valituri.
This text openethe.ij. knowleges in choice of fyshe. For either fysshe is
hard or soft: if hit be soft / the elder the better. The reason is / for
softenes comethe of humidite: which in young fyshe is undigested / and in old
is more digested: and so when such fyshes be yo^ge / they engendre fleme / but
when they be old they do nothing so much. And so appears / that an old yele
is holsomer tha^ a young / as some say. But if such fish be hard / than it
is holsomer young / that is / sooner digested / as pikes and perches be. For the
hardness resistethe digestion. This is the opinion of Auicen.ii. ca. de piscibus
/ saying: Of hard fyshes take the smallest: and of soft fyshes / chose the
greattest.

Lucius et parca / saxaulus / and albica / teuca.
Gurnus / plagicia / cum carpa / galbio / truca.
Here are rehearsed.x. sortis of fishes very wholesome for man's body. The first
is a pike / called the tyranne of fishes: For he not only deuoureth fishes of
other kind / but also of his own. On whom these verses were made: Lucius est
piscis rex and tyrannus aquarum.
A quo non differt Lucius iste parum.


The fish of a pike is hard / and swyfte in swymmy^ge. The.ij. is a perch /
diriuied of this verb parco / parcis to forbear or spare / by a clean
contrary sense / for a perch spares no fyshe / but wondethe other fyshes with
his fynnes on his back: nor a pike dare not venture upon a perch: but as
Albertus says / in his book of beastis nature / there is a natural amite
between the perch and the pike. For the pike hurt of an other fish / is
healed with great difficulte. But when he is hurt / he gothe unto the perch /
which seeing him hurt / touchethe and sokethe the wound / and so the pike is
healed. And the perch is like wise an hard fish. The.iij. is a see fyshe
called a sole / which is a special good fyshe. The.iiij. is a whytyng. The.v.
is a tenche / Which is a fresh water fyshe / whose skin is slyppery and
slymely / some what black: the meat thereof is hard. When so ever we will
dress a pike / a perch / or a tenche / we must take the skyn away. The.vj.
is gurnus / which is a see fyshe. This fyshe is as greatte in quantite / as
half a man's myddel finger / the which is eaten with the heed and fynnes.
The.vij. is a playce. The.viij. is a carpe / a fresh water fyshe / which is
much slyme: but greatte estates have them soddde in wine / and so the slymynes
is done away. The.ix. is a rochette / a see fish / and is a fish of hard
meat and wholesome. Some other textis have gouio / yt is a goien / which is
very wholesome fyshe. The.x. is a troute / which in eating is like samo^ / and
yet it is no samon / it is long / and not gross: it is taken in great ryuers
/ and will suffer it self to be rubbed and clawed / being in the water / and
so it is taken / and thereof pastis be made with spicis / and hit is a right
deynte fyshe. Touching the choice of fyshe / ye shall first understand /
that fyshe / compared with flesh / is less nourishynge / lyghter of digestion
/ and the nourishement thereof is full of fleumatike superfluites / cold / and
moist: and they be hardely digested / and abide long in the stomach. And by
reason the stomach laboreth in digestynge of them / and other while they be
corrupted in the stomach / they receive a certain putrified qualite / and
engendre thyrstynes. And surely the norisheme^t of laudable flesh is better
than of fyshe. Secondly / witteth well / ye see fyshe is better in regiment of
health / than other of the same sort taken in fresh water. For their
norysheme^t is not so superfluous / and is more nere to the nature of flesh.
But because see fyshe are harder than other of the sort taken in fresh water:
therefore they be of more difficulte in digestion / of more and pure
nourishement. Yet not withstanding / fresh water fyshe is holsomer for sick
folks / by reason of their feeble digestion. Thyrdelye note / Conditions of
good fyshe.
that fyshe / as well of salt water as fresh / should be chosen / the which
dressed are white / and not cla^my / but brittyll / not very gross / but
subtle / not of hard savor but soute / that does not soon putrify / of
good color / not bredde in lakes or pondis / nor in fylthy placis / nor in
water wherein grows ill wedes. And they ought not to be to old nor to yo^ge
/ that be swyfte of mouynge / and of small cla^myshenes. And if it be see fyshe
/ we must chose such as is taken in ryuers a good way from the sea / and
having the other forsayde conditions: And the more skaly that fish is the
better hit is: and hit is like wise understand by the fynnes. For many fynnes
and skales / betoke^ the pureness of the fyshes substance. Also among see fyshe
/ ye best be they that bread in the dippest water / that ebbeth and flows.
And therefore / the fyshe that is taken in the north see / that is more
surgynge / and more tempestious / and more swyfte in ebbynge and flowynge / are
better than the fyshe taken in the deed or the southe see. And ye shall like
wise understand of fresh water fyshe: For fyshe bred in deep water / is
better tha^ other of the sort bred in shalowe and vnnotable waters. And here
by may be sufficiently known / which fyshe should be chosen / and which not.
For beastiall fyshe / as the sea swyne / dog fyshe / and dolphin / are
unwholesome in the regiment of health. For they be hard of digestion / and of
superfluous humors. Nor in the meat of the forsayde fysshes / the above
nombred conditions appear not / as whitenes / subtilite and such other. And if
those fyshes and such like chance to be eaten / they should not be sodde as
soon as they be taken / but should be kept a few days after: till time the
meat of them mollify / and wax tender / without corruptynge of their
substance. And also the forsayde fyshes be better a little corned with salt
than fresh / or utterly salt. And among all see fyshe / the forsayde
conditions considered / the rochet and gurnat seem to be most wholesome. For
their meat and substance is most pure / and than next a playce and a sole.
But the meat of those is more cla^my / less frangible / less white / more
gross / and less subtle: nor the savor or smell of them is not so delicious
/ and per chance the whitynge is more commendable tha^ the rochet. For hit is
not so gross and cla^my / as a playce and a sole / and hit substance is
frangible inoughe / but the releshe / smell / color / pureness / of substance /
and mobilite considered / hit is not so good as the rochet and gurnade: And
like wise ye shall understand of herrynge. And the fyshe called morua / being
young inoughe / draws nere the forsayde fyshes in goodness / so that hit have
the above said conditions: yet hit is grosser and more cla^my / than the
forsayde fyshes. But salmon / turbut / and mackerell / be not so good: for they
be much grosser / more cla^my / harder of digestion / and fuller of
superfluite. Therefore they be only wholesome / for laborers / and young folks
of strong complexion: their cla^mynes / grossenes / and coldness / may be
taken away with certain sauces. Among fresh water fyshe / the forsayde
conditions considered / the perch and pike are the best / so they be fat:
and next are the vendosies / and than lopsters. And though the perch be more
skaly than these before said / yet the meat thereof is so white / fra^gible /
and subtle / as the pike and carpe: and hit is often found in pondes. And
universally / the best fresh water fyshe of the same sort / is hit that is
taken in water stonye in the bottum / runnynge north ward / deep / and
labourynge much / where into ronneth no vrdeurs of cites: and wherein no wedes
grow. Creueces both of the sea and ryuers / are much nutratiue / and corrupt
not lightly in the stomach: but they be hard of digestion. Farther more note /
that fresh fyshe moist the body / and encreace milk and sede of generation:
and is very wholesome for colerike folks. Eating of fyshe good and badde.
And after great travail or big labor / we should not eat fish / for than
hit soon corrupts in the stomach. And they that have a weak stomach / or
full of ill humors / ought to beware of eating fyshe. More over / gross
fyshe / corned with a little salt / is better than fresh fyshe. And fyshe of
long time saltynge is unwholesome. Also fyshe and flesh to gether should not be
eaten: nor fyshe and white meats: nor fyshe should not be eaten after other
meats. Also fyshe a little salted / and in small quantite taken is wholesome:
hit stereth up the appetite / and fortifieth hit / if one have an appetite
thereto.

Vocibus anguilie praue sunt si comedantur.
Qui phisicam non ignorant hec testificantur.
Caseus anguilla nimis obsunt si comedantur.
Nitu sepe bibas. et rebibendo bibas.
The auctor says here / that the yele is an unwholesome fyshe / and specially
hurtethe the voice. And this he proves by the saying of physicians / and
studentis of natural philosophe. The reason is / an yele is a slymye fyshe /
cla^my / and specially a stopper: and wantethe much of the conditions of good
fyshe before spoken. And this that is said by an yele / may be understand of
lampreys: all though lampreys be a little holsomer tha^ yeles / and less
ieoperdus / seeing they be not so cla^mye and gross as yeles. And though
these fyshes be delicious in taste / yet they be very perilous: for their
generation in the water / is like generation of serpe^tes on the earth.
Wherefore it is to be douted lest they be venomous: and therefore ye heedes and
tails / in which the venom is wont to be / and like wise the string within
/ should in no wise be eaten. Also hit is good to plunge them alive in good
wine / to take away their cla^mynes / and let them lie still therein till they
be deed / and than let them be dyght with galentyne made of the best spicis /
as great estates cokes are wont to do. Yet hit is good to parboyle them twyse
before in wine and water: and that brothe done away / to sithe them through /
and to make galantyne for them / or else to bake them / or frye them in grene
sauce with strong spicis / and a little good wine in winter: in summer to
dress them with a little wine / vergis and vinegar: but he that can foreare
these.ij. fyshes does best. Farther the text says / that chese and yeles
hurt much if they be eaten: and this is to be understand if ye eat great
quantite thereof. The cause of chese / is before showed at Persica poma etc. And
of yeles here now before. Hit folowtth in the text / that if those things be
taken with often drinking of wine / their hurtfulnes is amended: and this
should not be understand of subtle and percyng wine: nor of wine that is
given in way of drink co^ductiue: for such wine should not be given upon
meat / that enge^drethe ill humors / when hit is eaten: nor before / nor
after hit is digested: Auic. iii.i. ca. de regi^ne aque ^ viiii.
as Auicen says: For such wine enduceth great hurt: for hit causes ill
humors / engendered of that drink / to enter in to the extreme partis of the
body: which perauenture were not able to enter without help and leady^ge of
the wine. But this is to be understand of strong wine / not greatly percynge
/ often and in small qua^tite given / to thente^t to myxe ye meat to gether: For
such wine does alay the malice of ye meat / comforts digestion / and
directs the fleumatike cold humors: wherefore hit helps the digestio^ of
chese and yeles / that are of ill digestion.

Inter prandendum sit sepe parumque bibendum.
Si sumas ouum / molle sit atque nouum.
Here the auctor touches.ij. things. The first is / that one at dinner and
soupper should eat well and drink often and a littell at ones. And not to do
as a brute beast does / that eats his fyl of meat and drinks after ward:
For the better ye drink is myngled with the meat / the sooner the meat is
mollified / and the more capace of digestion. And here is to be noted / that
there is.iij. manner of drynkynges. The first is that mynglethe the meat to
gether: the.ij. that delateth hit: the.iij. that quenches thyrst. The first
that we spoke of is to be understand of drink myngled with our meat /
though we be not thyrstye. Thus we ought to drink even as we have eaten a
little. For outcepte a better reason / I say we may not abide till the meals
end / nor till we be a thyrste. And this manner drynkyng is specially good /
for them that feed on meat actuallye dry: as apperethe by sick folks / that
eat dry breadde. But drinking to quench thyrste / for such as be in good
tempre / should be forborne till the meals end: for than comethe the true
thyrste / through the heat of the meat hot and dry. Hit is not very
reasonable that thyrste and hunger should assail us both to gether: for they
are of contrary appetite. and this drink should be given after as the thyrst
is more or less. Drinking delatiue is most convenient after the first
digestion regularlye / and a little before we take other meat. And this manner
of drinking is wholesome / when the meats before taken were gross in
substance: nor thus to drink / we may not tarry till we be thyrsty. For this
drinking prepares ye stomach to receive other meat: and causes the meat
digested to descend from the stomach to the liver: nor this drinking should
not be in great qua^tite: to the end hit may sone be digested. For before hit be
digested / hit goth not to the liver. And this is of truth / outcepte such
drink delatiue were water / in which one must not tarry till digestion before
hit come to the liver. But regularly convenient drink delatiue or permixtiue /
ought not to be water / but wine / orels ale / bear / syder / pertey / or
such like / than all which wine is better. Secondly wittethe well / that the
grosser / dryer / and colder that meat is / the bygger the drink parmyxtiue
and delatiue should be. And contrary wise / the hotter / subtiler / and
moyster that meat is / the weak the dry^ke permixtiue and delatiue should be.
And the more subtle / hot / and digestible the meat is / the weaker the
drink or wine ought to be. Wherefore stronger wine should be drunk with befe /
than with chekyns / and we should drink stronger wine with fyshe than with
flesh. The.ij. doctrine is / that if we will eat an egg / hit must be rere
rostedde and new: the cause thereof is before showed.

Pisaque laudare decreuimus ac reprobare.
Pellibus ablatis sunt bona pisa satis.
Sunt inflatiua cum pellibus atque nociua.
Of pease^.
This text reherseth a notable thing of peasen. That is yt they some way are
preised / and some way dispreysed. They be lauded when they be eaten / the
husks taken away / and disco^mended / when they be eaten with the husks: for
than they enstate. And therefore it is not artificial to eat them in the husks
/ for the nature of that within and the husks / disagree. The one labourethe
to be losed and to go out: the other withsta^deth / and byndeth / as Isaac
says in dictis vniuersalibus. Wherefore a hurlynge mouynge is caused in the
body / inducynge gnawynge and inflasion in the bealye. And peasen do not this
all only / but also all pulce / as beans / chiches / chestons / and such
like. And specially such as have much husk / as beans and black ryce.
Also the husk of them all norysheth worse than the pithe within. And here is
to be noted / that there is a manner of white round peasen: whereof the codde is
very small and thynne: and one may eat these peasen with the husk more
surely than other / all though hit were better to hulle them. And albe it
that the reason before said is true touchy^ge al pulce / yet ye shall
understand / that the hulles of grene pulce is less / and less diversity is
between the husks and the pithe within / and more easy to digeste: And
therefore some say they be more wholesome for folks in health: but hit is not
so: For grene pulce is of right great superfluite and corruptible substance /
wherefore they be less holsomer for holle folks. And note this for a treuthe /
that dry pulce / the utter husk taken away / are more wholesome than grene: but
grene are better than dry vnhulled. Farther ye shall vnderstance / that the
substance of all pulce / is inflatiue and hard of digestion: and their ill
nourisheme^t is unwholesome in the regiment of health: but the broth of them is
wholesome: For the brothe of them makes the bealy laxatiue / and makes one
piss / and vnstoppeth the veins. Wherefore hit is wholesome at such times as
folks use gross and opilatiue meatis / as on fasting days. For in this
brothe or pottage conveniently made / are not the hurtes that be in the
substance: therein is no inflasion / nor difficulte of nourishement and
digestion / nor the malice of norisheme^t. This broth is made on this wise. The
ryce or peasen / must be laid in sythynge water: and therein a good while to
be all to robbed with ones hands: and after in the forsayde water should be
tempered all the night: and therein the next night following to be boiled
twyse or thryse / and than dyghte / and so reserved: And when the hour of
dinner drawethe nere / to dress it with cynomum and saffron / and a little
curtsy wine put thereto: and than boil hit ones / and so eat hit at beginning
of our refectio^. And the brothe or pottage of ryce and of round white peason
is better / and more wholesome and fre^dly to man's nature: and like wise their
substance.

Si febriat caput et doleat / non est been sanum.
To chose milk.
Here the auctor teachethe us certain lessons to chose milk. The first is /
that goottis milk is wholesome for them that be in a consumption / or be lean /
Auicenna ii. can. ca. de lacie. et i.iiii. tract. iii. ca. de remor. medic
humect. echicos.
or that have a consumyng ague. And Auicen says / that goottis milk and assis
milk are good for them that be in a co^sumption. The reason is / for that
gootis milk is temperate / and of much nourisheme^t. And next to this is
camels milk. For that is subtle / and of much aquosite and humidite: whereby
hit may moist them. Yet for truth this milk / through hit over much
humidite / nourishethe little: wherefore hit is not so wholesome for them as
goottis milk: yet this camels milk / newlye after folynge / is wholesome for
them that have the dropsye / and for them that have disease in the liver: for
it reuiueth the liver / as Auicen says. Secondly he says / Auicen. ii. can.
ca. de lacte.
that assis milk is holsomer than other / for dry folks in a consumption.
This is of truth / comparynge assis milk / with milk of other brute
beastis: for hit enclinethe to coldness and humidite / and is subtle and sooner
enters: and more slowelye conieyleth / than the milk of any other brute beast
/ as Galen says. The same says Auicen / Gale^. vi. de ingenio cap. vii.
Auicen de lacte.
and that after womans milk / there is none to assis milk. And he says if
any help the fever ethicke / hit is assis milk. Yet to compare assis milk
with woman's milk / hit is not so wholesome. For woman's milk taken by suckynge
is most wholesome / as Auicen says. The reason is: Auicen.i. quarti loco
preallex.
for woman's milk is cold / moist / more like to man's nature / swiftlier
entered / quickelier digested / and more norishyng. And this milk to be given
to them that be in a co^sumptio^ / should be mylked as nere the pacie^tis
beddis side as is possible / and forth with to ministre hit unto him / lest the
air corrupt hit. And here is to be noted / that in some cases / sower or
butter milk is better for folks in a consumption / than woman's milk or
assis. First is when by this fever ethike / they be cast in a laske. The.ij.
is / when they suspecte coagulation of the milk in ye stomach / either by
vehement heat of the fever: orels by cause the stomach of hit self is
colerike / the milk should turn to coler. The.iij. is when the ethike / is
coupled with a putrified fever: specially when there be not many opilations in
the interior partis. For sower milk restreineth the bealy / and turns not
lightly in to coler: for the buttrines of it is gone: whereby the milk lightly
enfla^meth: nor in a putrified fever / it is not sone putrified. The.iiij. is /
if the stomach be foul / for tha^ the milk corrupts lightly therein. The.v.
case is / when he that has the ethike disease / abhorrethe doulce and clean
milk / but not the sower or butter milk. The.iij. lesson is / that cow milk
and ship milk are more nutratiue / for they be fatter and grosser than other
/ Aui. ii. ca. ca. de lacte
for so says Auicen: And that all beastis milk / that in bringing forth
young / continues longer than a woman / is unwholesome: but the milk of those /
that bear egallye with woman / is most wholesome / as cow milk. Rasis.iii.
Alm^. cap. de lacte.
But Rasis says: that cow milk is the most grosest milk that any beast
gyuethe: and therefore hit is holsomer than other / for them that desire to be
fat. The.iiij. lesson is / that milk hurts them that have ye ague / or the
heed ache / The cause why is before showed at Persica poma etc.

Lenit et humectat. soluit sine febre butirum. Three propretes of butter.
Here the auctor shows.iiij. propretes of butter. The first is butter
mollifieth the bealy / and makes it slyppery / through it oylyues. The.ij. is
/ that butter is moist / for hit is made of the beast partis of the milk /
wherefore hit must needs be moist / seeing that the milk is moist / whereof it
is made. The.iij. is / that hit leuseth the bealye / and that is by the
slypperynes that hit causes in the guttis. These.iij. propretes Auicen
reherseth ii. can. cap. de butyro. And these.iij. propretes butter induces in
a body / not sick of a fever: for it hurts them that have an ague / for
butter with hit vnctuosite augmentethe the heat of the fever. Here is to be
noted / that though butter cause the forsaide propretes: Yet by reason of it
over much humidite and vnctuosite / it is unwholesome in way of meat:
specially to eat much thereof. For if one use to eat much thereof / hit
engenders lothsomnes / and makes the meat to swy^me about the brymme of the
stomach: and laxeth the bealy out of measure / and causes vomit. Therefore
butter should in no wise be eaten as meat in greatte quantite / and specially
hit should not be eaten after other meat: but to use hit with other meat /
hit is very wholesome.

Incidit atque lauat / penetrat / mundat quoque serum. This text opens.iiij.
propretes of whey. The propretes of whey.
The first is / hit is incisiue or subtle. The.ij. hit is washing or
scouring. The.iij. hit is persynge / which proprete proceeds of the first.
The.iiij. is / hit cleanses or purges. Auicen resitynge these propretes
says: that whey is subtiliatiue / Auicen.ii. can. cap. de lacte. Rasis.iii.
Alma^soris.
wasshyng / and leusynge: and therein is no mordication. Rasis says / that
whey does expelle ruddye coler / skabbes / and pushes: and also pympuls in the
face: and also it is wholesome for them that have the ianders: and for them that
be distempered by to much drinking of wine.

Caseus est frigidus / stipans / grossus quoque durus.
Caseus et panis bonus est cibus hic been sanis.
Si non sunt sani / tunc hunc non ^ungito pani.
Two things are here touched. First he puttethe.iiij. propretes of chese.
Four propretes of chese.
The first is / that chese is of a cold nature. And this is to be understand
of grene chese / which is cold and moist: and not of old chese / which is
hot and dry / as Auicen says: Auicen.ii. can. cap. de ^aseo.
Orels hit may be understand by chese / that cruddeth only of the milk /
without mynglyng of any other thing. For there is some chese of hot nature /
that heatethe the stomach and byteth the tongue / by mynglynge of other things
there with: as some chese grene in color: of which if one eat much in
quantite / does heat and inflame the body. The.ij. proprete is / that chese
makes one costife: this is of truth / specially if hit be hard / and made
with much renles. The.iij. is / that chese enge^dreth gross humors: and this
is truth of all chese: for all chese is made of the grosser and more erthye
part of the milk. The.iiij. proprete is / yt milk byndeth the womb / and
this and the.ij. is all one. Farther the text says / that though chese eaten
alone be unwholesome / whereby comes ill digestion / yet if one eat a little
curtsye with breadde / hit shall digest with the bread / and not other wise:
this is troth / if holle folks and not sick eat hit. We spoke before of
chese at Nutrit et impinguat etc.

Ignari medici me dicunt esse nociuum.
Sed tamen ignorant cur nocumenta feram.
Languenti stomacho caseus addit opem.
Si post sumatur terminat ille dapes.
Qui phisicam non ignorant hec testificantur.
Here the auctour blames them that absolutelye reprove the use of chese. And
he declares.ij. vtilites thereof. First chese comforts a sick stomach. And
here is to be noted / that al chese does not ease every diseased stomach. But
in other cases all chese hurts the stomach of selde knyttyng / and every
stomach weaked by long syckenes. But new grene chese of small cla^mynes /
co^fortethe a hot stomach / for as Rasis says: hit repressethe his brounes
and heat. And eke hit comfort a dry stomach / through it humidite. And
old chese or very tarte / or much cruddye / hurtethe much such stomakes.
But old chese / or very cruddye chese / comfortethe a stomach / where about
hangs much fleme: for such chese with his tartenes / cuttethe and scourethe
away the fleme. But new and soft chese hurts such a stomach right much.
And thus hit appears / that in some case these hurts always / and not in
some. And that new chese is some time good / and some time old. The.ij.
vtilite is / ye chese eaten after other meat / makes hit to discende down in
to the place of digestion: that is the bottum of the stomach. All this they
know / that have the very science of physic. And of tarte chese Rasis
says: Never the less a little curtsye thereof eaten after meat / fortifieth
the mouth of the stomach: and takes away the over much satiete and lothyng
of meat / that are wo^te to be engendered of sweet and unctuous meatis / about
the stomakes mouth.

Inter prandendum sit sepe parumque bibendum.
Vt minus egrotes / non inter fercula potes.
Here be.ij. lessons. The first is / that a man at his meat should drink
little and often. But this thing is al ready declared. The.ij. lesson / is that
between meals / we must forbear drink: specially if the meat that we did
eat be undigested in the stomach / except great necessite constrayne us: for
drinking than lets and breakethe digestion of the meat first taken. For
hit causes the meat to discende from ye stomach undigested: and puts away
the appetite: greueth the body / and engenders the fevers and other diseases.

Vt vites penam / de potibus incipe cenam. Here the auctour says / that one
ought to begin his soupper with drink. Some expound this verse thus: If thou
wylt eschew sickness / dry^ke at soupper or thou begin to eat. But this
exposition is reproved. For after physicians / a man should begin his soupper
with meat / and not with dry^ke. And all though this book was made for
english men / yet they keep not this rule: For at what hour of the day so
ever they drink / they eat a morsel breadde first. Therefore this verse may
be expound other wise: Hippoc. ii. partic. aphonsm^.
taking drink for meat moist and easy of digestion / as Hippocrates takes
drink wha^ he says: Hit is easyer to fylle one with drink tha^ with meat.
So that the sentence of this verse should be thus: It is better to begin our
soupper with drink / that is with meat moist / and easy of digestion / than
with gross / hard / and ill of digestion. The reason is / if we eat meat
moist and easy of digestion / after gross and hard of digestion / it would
through the digestive heat of the night / be sooner digested long before the
gross meats. And when it can not have issue for the gross meat undigested:
hit burns over much: or if hit issue / hit pluckethe part of the gross
meat undigested with hit. Therefore it is best to begin with meat moist and
easy of digestion: that when hit is digested / hit may without let issue out.

Singula post oua pocula sum noua
Post pisces nux sit / post carnes caseus assit.
Vnica nux prodest / nocet altera / tertia mors est.
Here be certain lessons. The first is / after the eating of every new laid
egg rere roasted / we must drink / and specially a draughte of wine. The
reason may be / by cause a new laid egg rere roasted / is of right great
nourishement / and easily digested: and it is of that sort that in small
quantite nourishes much: and principallye the yolke / as is before said at
oua ^^centia. So that the wine / which is frendlye to nature / causethe that
the egg is more desirously drawn of the norishynge members / and helpethe hit
to enter. An other cause may be. An egg discendeth but slowlye: and drink
helpethe hit to discende. The.ii. doctrine is / to eat nattis after fyshe / instead of ^hese: For nuttis through their drines / hyndreth thingendryng of
fl^me / that is wont to be engendered of fish. And for this cause nuttis are
the last service in lent. The.iij. lesson is / that after flesh we must eat
chese and not nuttis: for nuttis dry over much / and so does not chese: but
it causethe the meat to discende to ye buttum of the stomach / where the
virtue of digestion is. And this is certain / if the chese be neither to old
nor to new. Farther the text has in ye last verse / A nutte megge.
that a nutte megge / is wholesome for the body: hit makethe the mouth to savor
well / hit comfort the sight / and like wise the liver / spleen / and
specially the mouth of the stomach / as Auicen says. But the other common
nuttes / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de ^uce mus^ata.
called a walnut / is hurtful. This walnut / as Auicen says / does inflate /
ingendre ventosite in the womb / hit is hard of digestion / and stereth one
to vomit / and that by reason of hit calidite. But the.iij. nutte / that is
the nutte of the cross bow / is death / for the cross bow sleethe men.
Orels we may understand the nutte methel: which as Auicen says / is
venomous / wherefore hit sleeth.

Add potum piro / nux est medicina veneno.
Fert pira nostra pirus / sine vino sunt pira virus.
Si pira sunt virus / sit meledicta pirus.
Si coquas antidotum pira sunt / sed cruda venenum.
Cruda grauant stomachum / eleuant pira cocta grauatu^.
Post pira da potum / post pomum vade fecatum.
In the first verse here / he lerneth us to drink wine after peers. For peers
(as is before sufficientlye declared) engendre ventosite: and of their proprete
cause the colyke / and engendre blud fulle of aquosite: and therefore with them
one should drink strong wine: which consumethe ventosites and aquosites
engendered of peers. Secondly the text says / that nuttis is a remedy against
venom: as has been showed at Allea nux etc. Farther in the.ij. and.iij. verse
he shewethe / that peers eaten without wine are venomous / that is / hurtful
to man's nature / the cause is showed in ye first verse. Yet for all that peers
be not venomous simply / for if they were / they slay / and peers so doing are
accursed. In the.iiij. verse he shewethe / that raw peers are venomous / that
is: hurtful: for they make the humors to boil / and cause ye colike / sleme /
and skabbe. Yet if they be sodde / they be medicinable / in manner as is before
said / that is to say with wine: and specially eaten after other meat: for so
they expulce the dregs. In the.v. verse he says / that raw peers grieve ye
stomach: for they let his digestion / and inflate: but sodde peers releue the
stomach grieved: and dispose hit naturally. In the last verse are.ij. things.
The first is after peers we must drink / for the cause before said. The.ij.
is / that after eating of appuls / we must go to siege: for Auicen says:
Auicen.ii. can. ca. de pontis.
If sweet or sower appuls find any gross humors in the stomach / they force
them to discende from thence to the guttis: for appuls are much inflatiue and
engendre ventosites: which nature expels to the inferior partis.

Cerusa si comedas tibi con^ett grandia dona.
Expurgans stomachum / nucleus lapidem tibi tollit.
Et de carne sua sanguis eritque bonus.
Eating of cheries.
Here are declared.iij. commodites / that come of cheris eating. The first is
/ that cheris purge the stomach. This some say is truth / when the stones be
broken and eaten with all: for these.ij. to gether / of their proprete scour
and cleanse. The.ij. is / that the kyrnell of the cherie stone / by his virtue /
breaks the stone in ones raynes or bladder: and is eaten dry or made in
milk. The.iij. is / that the substance or meat of cheries / enge^dreth very
good bludde / comfort / and fattethe the body. And this is proved by
experience: for we se that sparowes / which are greatte eaters of cheries /
that in cherie time their lyuers be far greatter tha^ in other seasons:
whereby appears that cheries encreace and comfort the liver. Yet here is to be
noted / that there be.ij. sorts of cheris / gross / and small. And eke of
the gross are.ij. sorts / some are sweet / and some sower. All doulce and
small cheris are unwholesome: for they lyghtlye corrupt / and bread vermyn. The
gross and sower cheries are called cina: and of these are.ij. sorts: Some be
ruddye and soft of substance: and such must be eaten fresh and new gethered
/ and at beginning of dinner: their nature is to scour the stomach / and to
provoke the appetite. The other are black / gross / and hard of substance /
and specially the sower. And these should be eaten at ye beginning of dinner or
soupper. The cause is / for by their sowernes they close the mouth of the
stomach / whereby better and spedier digestio^ follows.

Infrigidant / laxant / multum prosunt tibi prima. Here he puts.ij. vtilites
coming by eating of prunes. First / prunes cool the body: And therefore
Portugals / that dwell in a hot country / always with their meat sithe
prunes. The.ij. prunes cause one to laske / by reason of their humidite and
cla^mines: as Gal. says. Galen.ii. alime^toru^. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de prunis.
This is of troth if they be ripe: for prunes yt be not ripe / be stypticall
and norishe little as Auicen says. And though damask prunes have the forsayde
vtilites / yet proprelye they be ascriued to prunes of Armeny. For prunes of
the country of Armeny / are better than any other: And they unbind the womb
more vehemently than other / as Auicen says. For a more declaration / ye
shall understand / that ripe prunes are used / and not unripe. The best
prunes.
And prunes most wholesome for man's nature be the long ones / that have little
substance about the stone / small / hard / in manner dry / and the utter skyn
thynne: and they should not be sweet in taste / but some what sower / and of
this sort are Damask prunes: and such refreshe and cool the body / as said
is. There be many other sorts of prunes / whose use is not accepted. There be
also prunes / calledde wild prunes / which grow in ye woddes: these be not
laxatiue: of them water is distilled to by^de the womb. Prunes that are taken
to make one to laske / must first be laid in cold water: for than they
cool and moist more perfectly: and by slipperynes they leuse the coler that
they come to: and so the stomach is better disposed to receive food. And here
is to be noted / that moist prunes and new are more alteratiue / though they
be of worse norishement / and of more superfluite: but dry prunes comfort
more / and better nouryshe the body. And as hit is said by prunes / so after
the manner is understand of cheris. Yet not withandynge the humidite of cheris
is subtiler and less cla^my / whereby they norishe less than prunes.

Persica cum musto vobis datur ordine iusto.
Sumere sic est mos / nucibus sociando racemos.
Passula non spleni tussi valet / est bona reni.
Here be.iij. doctrines. The first is / that with peches we should drink must
/ for.ij. causes: the first is / for must is hot / and boyleth in our body:
which boylynge and heat the peche with it coldness fordoth. The.ij. cause is /
for peches be right cold / and cool the body very much: Therefore that wine
should be drunk upon them / which heateth more than other. But that is must
/ that is known by experience. The manner how we should eat peches and other
frutis / is declared at Persica poma etc. The.ij. doctrine is / that with old
dry nuttis we must eat resyns. For new gethered nuttis are by them self
wholesome: but old dry nuttis are greatte driers: and through their vnctuosite
they lyghtelye inflame the body: wherefore with them resyns must be eat /
which restrain infla^mation and drynes / by reason they moist. And of nuttis
is spoken more largely at Allea nux etc. The.iij. doctrine is / that resyns of
corans hurt ye spleen / for it causes opilation thereof: yet they are wholesome
for the raynes: for by their provoking of urine they purge the raynes.

Scrofa / tumor / glandes / ficus cataplasmate cedit
Iunge papaner ei confracta foris tenet ossa.
Here be declared.ij. wholesome things / that come by playsters made of fygges.
First / figs sodde in water / and moist laid to any of these.iij. diseases
cures hit / that is swynes yuell / kyrnels / and swellynges. By swynes yuell
is understand inflasion under the chynne about the throat. And it is called
scrofula a scrofa / that is to say a sow or a swyne: either because this
disease chances many times to swyne through their gulosite: orels by cause ye
shappe of this disease is likened to swyne / as Auicen says. Auicen.iii.iiii.
tract. ii. cap. de stropulis.
By kyrnels are understand impostumes / which commonly chance under ye arm
pittis / and in the groynes. And by swellyng may be understand inflasions in
any part of ye body. Wherefore to hele these impostumes / and specially to ripe
them / figs should de sodde with water: A plaster made of fygges.
and with the water should be mixed a litell curtsy of vinegar: which should
help the virtue of the figs to enter. And when it is sodde / the fygges must
be beat in a mortar: and tha^ myngled with a curtsy of the water that they
were sodde in: and so make a plaster. A plaster is proprely a medicine made
of some herb / or flower / and the joyce thereof: as this verse says: Tunc
cataplasma facis / cum succum ponis et herbam. The.ij. vtilite is / that a
plaster made of figs and popie sede joins or sets broken bones to
gether again. A plaster of fygges and popie sede.
And they must be sodde to gether in water without vinegar: and than stamp hit
in a mortar / and put thereto a littell of the water that it was sodde in: and
so lay hit to the sore. The reason hereof may be: because popie sede both takes
away the sensiblenes of the me^bres / whereby the ache / that is wont to chance
in breaking of bones / is done away / and provoke to sleep. Fyggis eke draw
the humidites of the body to the utter partis: which humidites brought to
the bones / may draw / retain / or hold them to gether / but never
perfectely knytte them. And witteth well / that there be.iij. kinds of popis /
white / read / and black. The red is venomous / and growethe among corn.
Young schole^s are wont to stamp the flowers thereof / to make them read ynke.

Pediculos / veneremque facit / sed cuilibet obstat. Eating of fygges.
Here be declared.ij. operations of fyggis. The first. Much eaty^ge of fyggis
makes one lousy: and this is for certain / if the fygges be dry / as Auicen
says. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de ficubus.
And he says yt the cause is through the maliciousnes and corruption of the
humor of them engendered. And eke an other cause may be / for that figs
stere one to sweet much / whereof lyce are engendered. The.ij. operation is /
fygges stere one to carnal lust: and like wise they have many superfluites /
and augmente the sede of generation.

Multiplicant mictum. ventrem dant escula strictum.
Escula bona dura / sed mollia sunt meliora.
Here are declared.ij. vtilites of medlars. The first is / that they enc^eace
urine: that is by reason they make the dregs hard / and so the wtattrynes
turns in to much urine. The.ij. vtilite is / medlars make one costife
through their sowernes and stipticalnes / and therefore the text says / hard
medlars be good to stop the laske. But yet the soft medlars be better than
the hard: for they noryshe more and bind less. And here is to be noted /
that medlars noryshe less than appuls / peers / peches / fygges / and such
like: which thing apperethe playnelye by their egernes of relishe or taste /
and hardness of their substance after they be ryped on the tree / and therefore
we should eat few medlars / and rather in way of medicine than meat. And
because they be very stipticall / they be wholesome for ye laske. And because
medlars ripe not on the tree soft enough to eat / they must be laid till
they be soft: and than they be more delectable and less stipticall.

Prouocat vrinam mustum / cito soluit / and inflat. Three propretes of must be
here touched. First / must provoke one to pysse / for in must are the
erthy pertis scouryngly bytynge the bladder / when they come thereto: by reason
whereof the bladder is constrained to avoid the urine. And this proprete is
understand of mustis / that have bytynge lies / as much reinnishe must. For
mustis that have gross lies are not nyppy^ge / but rather stoppynge and
lettynge of urine / as is before said at Impedit vrinam etc. The.ij. proprete
/ must makes one lightly laske / through the same cause showed in the first
proprete. Thyrdly / must is inflatiue: for the boylynge that hit makes in the
body / reyseth up ventosites. The causes of these.ij. propretes are showed
before at / Impedit vrinam.

Grossos humores nutrit seruisia vires.
Prestat / augmentat carnem / generatque cruorem.
Prouocat vrinam / ventrem quoque mollit and inflat.
Infrigidat modicum / sed plus desiccat acetum.
Infrigidat / macerat melanc dat / sperma minorat.
Siccos infestat neruos / and pinguia siccat.
Here the auctour touches.ij. things. First he puts.viij. propretes of ale
or bear. First / ale engenders in man's body gross humors / which is of
troth in regard of wine. And after the diversity of the corn or gross
substance the ale is made of / the grosser humors are engendered. Secondly /
ale augmentethe the strengthes: and this does ale made of the best grain and
well sodde: for by reason hit nourysheth much hit encreaceth strength. Thyrdly
/ it encreateth flesh: by reason hit nourysheth much: and for the same cause
hit encreaceth the bludde. And these.iij. last propropretes is in stale ale /
well sodde / and made of the best grain. Fyftely / hit stereth one to pysse.
Syxtly / hit makes one to laske. And these.ij. propretes is in clear bear / yt
has much of ye hoppe / as bear of Amburgens / which by reason of the hoppes
bryngethe one in a laske. And hit is not good for them that have a weak
brain. For this bear / by reason of hoppis does lyghtlye overcome the brain.
Seuently / hit enflateth the bealye: this is of truth if hit be ill sodde: as
Holande bear does: which enflateth most / and stops / and therefore fatteth
right much. The.viij. is / that a little curtsye ale colethe. So does bear
of Hollande / Brabande / Heynault / and Flanders. And this is hit that we use
daily. And this proprete is for certain in respect of wine. Here is to be
noted / that ale may be made of ootis / barley / and wheat. And as the grain
is altered / so is the complexion of the ale. Hit that is made of barley /
inclines more to cold / for barlye is cold. Hit that is made of barley and
ootis / stoppethe less / and less engenders ventosites / and less
nourishes. And ale made of wheat malte / inclines more to hete / nouryshethe
more / and stoppethe more. And the grosser the ale is / the worse hit is / the
subtiler the better. Farther / ale made of things / that makes one drunk is
worste / as of darnell. For this grain specially engenders heed ache / and
hurts the senowes. Farther in the text are.v. propretes of vinegar. The
first is hit driethe. For Auicen says / hit is a strong drier. Auicen.ii.
can. ca. de aceto. Auic. iii.i. in ca. vnico. doct. v.
And therefore physicians bydde in time of pestilence to use hit with meat and
drink. For Auicen says / he that uses vinegar in his meat and drink in
pestilence time / needs not to dread the sickness. The.ij. is / that vinegar
of it own proprete coleth. Thyrdly / hit makes one lean / by reason that hit
driethe. And this is for a very troth if one take it fasty^g / as Auicen
says. Yet never the less / Auic. iii.i. doct. iiii. cap. v.
continual use of vinegar / specially fasting / causes many inco^uenie^ces:
it febleth the sight / hurts the breast / causethe the cough / hit hurtethe
the stomach and liver / and vehemently oppresses the senowes / and joints:
them vexynge with arteticall grefes / trembling and shakinge. Fourthly /
vinegar engenders melancoly / by reason it cools and dries. Fyftely /
vinegar diminishes ye sede of generation / for that hit coolethe driethe / and
makethe lean. These propretes Rasis puts / saying / Vinegar is cold and
dry / which makes lean / distroieth the strengthes / diminishes the sede
of generation / enforces black coler / weaketh ruddye sanguine coler / and
makethe the meat subtle / that hit is myngled with. In the last verse the
auctour puts.iij. things. First / that vinegar hurtethe lean folks / by
reason hit dries / and hit tartnes makes hit dry the more. For like joined
to like / makes ye one more furious. And eke eueri decaide complexion is help
by the contrary / and by the like / is brought in worse case. Secondly /
vinegar hurts the senowes / and thirdly hit makes lean / as is before fayde.

Rapa iuuat stomachum / nouit producere ventum.
Prouocat vrinam / faciet quoque dente ruinam.
Si male cocta datur / hinc tortio tunc generatur.
Here are declared.iij. vtilites of rapes te^perately sodde / and one
inconvenience of the same. First / rapis comfort the stomach: for the stomach
digesteth them well / and is not grieved there with. Secondly / rapes break
wind / as apperethe by experience. Thyrdly / rapes provoke the urine. Yet
besides these propretes / Auerrois says / rapes greatly comfort the syghte.
The hurt of rapes is / the continual eating of them hurtethe the tethe. In
the last verse he says / rapis cause throws or gnawyng in the bealy / by
reason they multiply ventosites / as says this verse: Ventum sepe rapis / si
tu vis viuere rapis. The tails of rapis leusethe the bealye. Farther more note
/ that of all rootis / rapis do best norishe man's body / as appears by the
swetenes found in their savor. For all sweet meats nouryshe more the body
than sower / bitter / or terte. Therefore by cause rapes be sweteste of all
roots / and less sharp / they be most wholesome in way of meat: but yet
they engendre gross melancoly bloudde / if they be not well digested. And hit
is good to purify them from the first water / and in no wise to eat them
raw. They stere one to bodily lust / and cleanse the ways that the urine
ronneth.

Egeritur tarde cor digeritur quoque dure.
Similiter stomachus melior sit in extremitates.
Reddit lingua bonum nutrimentum medicine.
Digeritur facile pulmo / cito labitur ipse.
E^t melius cerebrum gallinarum reliquorum.
In this passage are noted.v. things. The first is / that the har^e of beastis
is slowelye digested: by reason the heart flesh is mela^colious / which is
hardly digested / and slowly descends / and as Auicen says / is unwholesome
flesh / Auicen.ii. can. ca. d^ nuce.
and as Rasis says / hit nourishes little. The.ij. is / that the mawe like
wise is ill of digestion / and slow of discendynge: by reason hit is a senowye
membre and gristly: wherefore it digesteth ill / and enge^dreth ill blud.
Farther the text says / that the extreme partis of the mawe / as the bottum
and brymme are better digested: by reason that those pertis are more fleshie
and fat. The third is / that ye tongue is of good nouryshement / and that is
touching the rote / (...). can. (...) cap. de (...)*
as Auicen says / by reason hit is fleshie / and of easy digestion. And
among all other / a roasted pigs tongue / ye skin scraped of / is like
braune: as princis karuers know. A netis tongue by reason of hit moystnes / is
not very wholesome. But for all this / these delicate fellows / or they roast a
netis tongue / they stop hit with cloves / where by the moystnes is diminished
/ and the meat is apter to eat. The.iiij. is / that the lyghtis are easy of
digestion / and easy to be voided out / and this is by reason of their
natural softenes. Yet their norisheme^t is unwholesome for man's nature: for hit
is little and flematike / as Auicen says. And here is to be noted / Auic.
can. (...) cap. de pu^mone.
that though the lyghtis of a tuppe be unwholesome to eat / yet hit is
medicinable for a kybed or a sore hele / if it be laid hot there unto / as
Auicen says. The.v. is / that a hens brain is best: Auicenna (...) anon.
which (as Auicen says) stancheth bledynge at the nose. Hit must be eaten
either with salt or spices: for of hit self hit provoke one to vomit. And
physicians say / that chickyns brains augment ye memory. The brain of a
hog is unwholesome for man: but the brain of a sheep / of a hare / or a cony /
may be eaten with salt or spices. And of the brain we have more largely
spoken before at / Nutrit and impinguat etc.

Semen feniculi fugat / and spiraculi culi. Here is declared one doctrine of
fenell sede called maratrum / which breaks wind: Eating of fenel sede.
by reason hit is hot and dry. And here is to be noted / that by eating of
fenell sede / as physicians say / are engendered.iiij. co^modites. First / hit
is wholesome for the ague. Secondly hit auoydeth poison. Thyrdly / hit cleanses
the stomach. Fourthly / hit sharpethe the syghte. These four vtilites are
rehearsed in these.ij. verses.

Bis duo dat maratrum / febres fugat / atque venenum.
Et purgat stomachum / lumen quoque reddit acutum.
And eke Auicen rehersethe these.iiij. propretes. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de
feniculo.
And as touching the last of the.iiij. he says as folowethe: Democritus
demed / that venomous worms desire new fenell sede / to comfort and sharp
their sight: and serpentis after winter / issuynge out of their caves / do
rub their eyes against fenell / to clear their sight. Farther note / that
fenell digesteth slowly / and norisheth ill and little: and therefore hit is
used as a medicine / and not as meat. Wherefore hit ought not to be used in
the regiment of health / but to expelle the vnholsomenes of other meats: As we
use some time to eat persly with lettis / to resist the coldness and humidite
of the lettis: so like wise fenell may be sodde with gourdes and rapis / to
withstand the vnholsomenes of them.

Emendat visum / stomachum confortat anisum.
Copia dulcoris anisi sit melioris.
Here thauctour openethe.ij. vtilites of dyll. First / dyll comfort the
syghte / and secondlye the stomach: by reason yt hit mundifieth the stomach /
and heteth hit: and eke for the same reason hit comfort the syghte: Most
hurfull for the syghte.
for nothing hurtethe the sight more / than uncleanness of the stomach. For from
the unclean stomach ascend unclean vapors / that hurt the eyes in
troubly^ge the sighty spiritis. These are the.ij. propretes of doulce dylle.
And beside these / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de aniso.
Auicen rehersethe many other profits of dylle / saying that hit aswagethe
dolours / breaks wind / quenches thyrst / caused of salt moystnes / hit
openethe opilations of the liver and spleen / engendered of humidites: and like
wise of the raynes / bladder / and matrice: hit provoke urine / and
menstruous flixe: hit cleanses the matrice from white humidites: and stereth to
carnal lust.

Si cruor emanat spodium sumptum cito sanat. Here thauctour puttethe one
co^modite of spodiu^: and that is that spodium taken heals the blodye flixe:
by reason that of hit own virtue hit co^fortethe the liver: and so the liver
fortified (which is the original fountain of bludde) the blud is there
better retained. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de spodio.
And Auicen says / that spodium is the roots of redes burned. And hit is
said / that these rotes / moved by the wind / and rubby^ge them self to
gether / burn one a another. Yet Simon the Ianway says / that spodium is a
thing whose beginning is unknown unto us: hit seems to be a thing burnt /
and divisions of redes burned. And hit does not only help the bluddye flyxe
/ but also the laske and spuynge / as Rasis says. Hit helps also a sharp
ague / and is comfortable against the shaking thereof / and for over much
avoiding of coler hit helps the stomach / as Auicen says. And as spodium
does help and comfort the liver: so there be other medicines / that have
like aspecte and like proprete to comfort other special members: as mace the
heart: musk the brain: lykeres the lyghtes / caper the spleen / and galyngale
the stomach / as appears by these verses.

Gaudet eparspodio / mace cor / cerebrum quoque musco.
Pulmoliquiricia / splen / epar / stomachusque galanda.
Vas condimenti preponi debet edenti.
Sal virtus refugat / and non spaciumque saporat.
Nam sapit esca male / que datur absque sale.
Vrunt persalsa visum / spermaque minorant.
Et generant scabiem / prur^tum / sieve vigorem.
This text opens.iij. things. First he puttethe a general doctrine
observed every where: that before all other things salt must be set upon
the table / as the vulgar verses teach us: Sal primo poni debet primoque
reponi.
Omni^ mensa male peronitur absque sale.


Secondlye he touchethe.ij. wholesome things of salt. First / that salt
resists venom for.ij. causes. First for that salt is a drier: and so with
hit drines / dries up the humidites yt would corrupt. An other cause is / that
salt dries and supresseth the humidites / drawing them out of the body / and
so shuts the poores / and consequently stops the entrance of venom /
which is wont to enter by the poores. The.ij. wholesome thing is / salt
makes man's meat sauorie. For co^monlye we se no meatis sauorie without salt
/ as says the third verse. Thyrdly ye auctour opens.iiij. inco^ueniences
of salt or meats to much salted. First / very salt meats mar the sight
/ for.ij. causes. The first is / that salt things dry over much / which is
contrary to the eyes / the instrumentis of syghte / for the eyes are of the
nature of water / (...) in de sensu and se^^.
as the philosopher says. The.ij. cause is / for that meats very salt
engendre ytche and nyppynge / in manner as is before said. Of mordicatiue meatis
being in the stomach / fumes mordicatiue are lyfted up / which by their
nyppynge hurt the eyes / and make them very read. And therefore we se that
they that make salt / have commonly redde eyes. The.ij. hurt is / that very
salt meats diminishe ye sede of generation: by reason that very salt meatis
dry right much all the humidites of the body: wherbye also the sede of
generation is dried / and so lessed. The.iij. hurt is / it engenders the
scabbe: by reason that salt enge^dreth a sharp bytynge humor adu^t / which
causes ye scabbe. The.iiij. hurt is / hit augmenteth ytche: by reason hit
engendrethe a mordicatiue ytchynge humor. And these.iiij. hurtis Rasis
remembers speaky^ge of salt / thus: Farther hit burns their blud that take
great quantite thereof: hit febleth their sight / minisheth the sede of
generation: and enge^dreth ytche and scabbe* and besides these hurtis / very
salt meat engenders ring worms / dry scurfes / morphewe / lepre / in them
that be disposed there unto / and sleathe the passage that the urine ronnethe /
when they are long continued: yet when hit is a little poudred hit takes
away lothynge / and makes one to have a good appetite.

Hi feruore vigent tres salsus / amarus / acutus.
Alget acetosus / sic stipans ponticus atque.
Vnctus et insipidus / dulcis dat temperamentum.
Here are put the qualites of all sauerines. First he says / that these.iij.
sauerinessis or relishes / salt / bitter / and sharp / heat the body that
receives them. Secondly he says / that these.iij. sauerinessis / terte /
stipticall / and ponticke / cool. Thyrdly he says / yt these.iij. relishes /
unctuous / unsavory / and sweet / are temperate / they make the body neither
hotter nor colder. Farther after Auice^ / there be.vii^. talages or
sauerinesses / that follow vnsauerynes: and they be / sweet / bitter /
Auicen.ii. can. tract. i. cap. iii.
sharp / terte / pontike / stiptike / and unctuous: and to nombre vnsauerynes
for sauerynes / as ye text does / there be.ix. and than sauerynes is taken for
every thing iuged by the taste. And among these talages there be.iij. hot /
as says the text / salt / bitter and sharp: and as Auicen says / ye sharp
is the hotter / and next is salt / and than bitter: for as much as sharp is
stronger to resolve incidentis and scour / than bitter. And than salt is like
bitter / broken to gether with cold humidite. And of these talages.ii^. be
cold / eger / stiptike / and pontike. But pontike is colder tha^ the other:
and next is stiptike / and than eger. And therefore all fruits / that come to
any swetenes / have first a talage pontike / of a vehement coldness: and after
that by digestive heat of the son / the fruits be digested / there apperethe
in them stiptisite: and after they decline to sowernes / as grapes / and than
to swetenes. And though terte be not so hot as stiptike / yet through hit
subtilite and persynge / is in many of more coldness. And after Auicen po^tike
and stiptike are in talage very like: but yet the stiptike causethe the upper
part of the tongue to be sharp and roughe / and pontike causes the tongue to
be roughe within. And.iij. of these talages are temperate / neither exceeding
hot nor cold / as sweet / unctuous / and unsavory: for though sweet be hot
/ yet therein apperethe no mighty heat / as Rasis says. And every talage has
hit own operations / as Auicen and Rasis say. The operations of sweet says
Auicen / be digestion / sokynge / and encreasynge of norishement / and nature
louynglye desires hit / and the virtue attractiue draws hit. And after Rasis
/ sweet engendrethe much ruddye color / and opilations of the liver and
spleen / specially if the said members be apt there unto. And thereof follows
ye flixe. Hit mollifieth the stomach / and comfort the breast and lightis /
hit fatteth the body / and augmenteth the sede of generation. The operations of
bitter / after Auicen / be sharpynge and washing away. And after Rasis /
bitter heateth and dries strongly / and lightly reduces the bludde to adust
malice / and augme^teth ruddye color in the blud. The operations of pontike
talage / after Auicen / is contraction / if the ponticite be feeble / orels
expression / if hit be strong. And after Rasis / pontike cools the body /
driethe the flesh / and diminishes the bludde / if one use hit often. Also hit
comfort the stomach / byndethe the womb / and engendrethe melancolye
bludde. The operation of stiptike talage after Auicen / are contrary /
thyckyng / hardnynge / and holding. And after Rasis the operatio^s thereof are
like pontike / though they be weaker: for he seems to comprehend stiptike
talage under pontike: for of stiptike he says nothing expressly. The
operations of unctuous talage / after Auicen / are sokynge / slipperines / and
small digestion. And after Rasis / hit mollifiethe the stomach / makes one
laskatyue / and fyllethe one or he has taken any necessary quantite of meat:
and it heateth / specially them that be vexed with a fever: and that have a
hot liver and stomach. Hit moysteth and soketh the body: but hit augmenteth
fleme and sleep. The operatio^s of sharpnes be resolution / incision / and
putrefaction after Auicen: And after Rasis encreaceth heat / and lyghtlye
enflameth the body / and burns the blood / turnethe hit in to read coler /
and after in to black. The operations of salt talage / after Auicen / is to
scour / wash / dry / and let puttifaction. The operatio^s of sharp talage /
after Auicen / is to cole and divide: and after Rasis / hit refrayneth coler
and bludde / and restrayneth the bealye / if the stomach and guttis be clean:
but if there in be much fleumatike matter / hit makes the bealye laske /
cools the body / and eke weaketh the virtue of digestion / proprely in the
liver. It hurts the senowes and senowye members / it dries the body: but hit
stereth up the appetite. But of vnsauerynes operations Rasis says / that some
unsavory thing norisheth well / and that is such as is temperate. There is
other some that heateth temperately / and an other that cools temperatly /
and if moystnes be joined there with / hit moystethe / and with a dry thing /
hit dries.

Bis duo vipa facit / mundat dentes dat acutum
Visum / quod minus est implet / minuit quod abundat.
Here are declared.iiij. co^modites of wine soppis. The first is / they purge
the tethe / by reason they stycke longer in the tethe / tha^ wine alone or
bread alone: therefore the fylthynes of the tethe is the better consumed / and
the tethe the better purged. The.ij. co^modite is / that hit sharpeth the
syghte: for it lets the ill fumes to ascend to ye brain: which by their
mynglynge to gether / dark the syghte. And this is by reason hit digesteth all
ill matters being in the stomach. Thyrdly / hit digestethe perfectly meats
not well digested: for it closes the mouth of the stomach / and conforteth
digestion. Fourthly / hit reducethe superfluous digestion to mean. All this is
of truth / so that the breadde sopped in wine / be first tosted / or dried
on imbers.

Omnibus assuetam iubeo seruare di^tam.
Approbo sic esse / ni sit mutare necesse.
Est hipocras testis / quoniam sequitur mala pestis.
Fortior est metha medicine certa dieta.
Quam si non curas / fatue regis / et male curas.
Here are certain doctrines. The first is / that hit is good for all folks
to keep customable diete. To keep diete*
And by diete is understand the ministrynge of meat and drink. The reason is
this. Breaking from customable use hurts grievously: for customance is an
other nature: Therefore / as hit behooves us to keep nature / so like wise hit
does custom: and specially if the customable use be laudable. And as hit
behooves to keep the wont administration of meat and drink: even so hit
behouethe us to observe custom in other things not natural / for the self
reason. Wherefore if a man wont to labor much / will for go this custom and
live ydelly: or labor much less: or go in hand with other labor: or take
an other time / or a noway: undoubted it shall right much infeble him. So in
like manner it is in man's diete / in his sleep / in his watch / and such like
accidentis. For truly good custom in all thing must needs be observed / if hit
be laudable or indifferent in goodness or hurtfulnes / in respect of hit /
whereto the change is made. And wytteth well / that they that be accustomed to
labor / and exercise them self in any kind of labor / all be hit they be
feeble or old / hit greueth them less / and labor more strongly tha^ if they
were yo^ge fellows / unaccustomed / as Hippocrates says.ii. aphorism^. by
reason that these feeble or old persons have more inclination and custom to
these labors: For now the custom before taken is lyghter / as is said in
the aforsayde aphorism. And this is the cause / why we se old and feeble
crafts men / to do that stronger and younger than they can not do / and hit
greueth them less: as a feeble old mylner to lift a greatte weyghtye sack: A
smythe to awey with greatter hammer labor / than a younger man not thereto
accustomed. The.ij. doctrine is / that greatte harm folowethe change of diete
/ as Hippocrates says: outcepte hit be needful to change hit. First hit is
nedeful to change it / wha^ grievous diseases should grow thereby: as custom to
feed on ill meats / which at length of necessite will bread in us ill
diseases. Such a custom and like must needs be amended and changed by
little and little / but not suddenly. For all sudden cha^ges hurt vehemently
/ specially from a thing customable / to vnaccustomable. Secondly / it is
nedeful to change / to thentent / it less grieve us / if we happen to change
our diete. For he yt uses him self to all manner diete / shall hurt him the
less. And this eke must be understand of other things not natural / for as
Hippocrates says.ii. aphoris. A thing long customed / though hit be worse
than these we have not used / hurts the body less. Therefore hit behouethe us
to use things unaccustomed. And here is to be noted / that every man should
take heed / how he accustomethe him to one thing / be hit never so good /
which to observe were needful. Example. If a man custom him to one manner
meat or drink / or to abstain holly from them / or to sleep / or to know a
woman carnally / it were very dangerous for him / if he other while must
abstain from this custom. Therefore every body should be disposed / to endure
heat and cold / and to all mocions and norisheme^tis / so that the hours of
sleep and watshe / the house / bed / and garmentis / may be changed without
hurt: which thing may be done / if one be not to nere in observing custom.
Therefore other while hit behooves to change customable things / Thus says
Rasis. The third doctrine is / that the stronger and nere way in healynge a
pacient / Rasis.iii. Alm^. ca. de conseruat. consuet.
is to ministre a certain diete: For which if the physician does not care /
and will ministre an other undue diete / he foolishely governs his pacient /
and healethe him ill. And note / that there be.iij. manner of dietes / gross /
which is holle folks diete / Three manner of dietes.
sklender diete / which is to give in manner nothing: The third is mean
diete / which absolutely is called sklender. And this diete is divided in to
sklender diete / declinynge to gross diete: as the brothe of flesh / rere
roasted eggs / small chickyns: and declinyng to sklender diete / as mellicratum
/ and wine of pome garnades: and mean diete / which is called certain diete
/ as barley ieuse not bearen to gether. And this certain diete is wholesome in
many diseases / but not in all. Hit is not wholesome in long diseases: for in
such diseases / the might of ye pacient / with such mean diete / can not
endure to consume the sickness / without great debilite: Therefore in such
diseases / the meat must be engrossed. Like wise it is unwholesome in sharp
diseases / as these that end within.iij. days space or sooner: for in such
most sklender diete is best / as Hipp. says.i. aphoris. there: The most
sovereign help is to diete the pacie^t after his strength and corporal might.

Quale / quid / and quando / quantum / quoties / vbi dando.
Ista notare cibo debet medicus dietanda.
This text reherseth.vj. things / to be considered of the physician in
ministryng of diete. First / of what qualite the meat ought to be: for in
hot syckenes / we must diete the pacient with cold meat: in moist
sickness dry meat / and in dry sickness moist meat. Yet the natural
complexion must be observed with diete like thereto: For Gal. says: Ga. ^. teg.
The hotter bodies need the hotter medicines: the colder bodies / the colder
medicines etc. The.ij. thing is / of what substance the meat ought to be: For
they that be strong and lustye / and exercise greatte labor / must be dieted
with grosser meat: for in them the way of digestion is strong: and so they
ought not to use sklender meats / as chyckyns / capons / veale / or kydde:
For those fleshes in them will burn / or be digested over soon: wherefore they
must needs eat often. But noble men and such as live restfully / must use
diete of sklender substance: for in them ye virtue digestive is weak / and not
able to digeste gross meats: as bacon / befe / and fish dried in ye son.
Like wise they that be sick of sharp diseases / ought to use more sklender
diete / than they that be sick of long diseases / as a fever quartane.
The.iij. is what time diete ought to be given: for they yt be in health ought
specially to regard custom. Wherefore they that rise yerly in somer / and eat
but.ij. meles a day / ought to eat about the hour of.x. or a little before:
and not to abide till noone / because of the over great heat. Like wise they
ought to suppe about the hour of.vj. or a little after. But in winter they
ought to dine at a.xj. of the clock / or at.xij. because of the long
slepynge: and than to suppe at.vij. a clock / or a littell after. And
specially custom should be kept. Time also in dietynge of sick folks / must
be considered. For they that have an ague / when it begins to vex them / or
a littel before or after / they should eat nothing: for if one eat a little
before / or when the fytte comes: thereby nature / that should entende to
digest the meat / is diuerted an other way. If he should eat sone after the
fytte is gone / hit were unwholesome: for the virtue of digestion is very weak /
by reason of the fytte paste: Therefore he must eat so long before / as the
meat may be digested or ye fytte come. Orels so long after the fytte is gone
/ when nature is come to due disposition. This is of truth / outcepte ye
dread great febleshynge of nature: for tha^ at al times he must eat. For when
so ever ma^s strength be feblished by any chances / he should eat forth with
as says Galen / in the gloss of this aphoris. Conte^plari aute^ etc. Fourthly
/ the quantite of the meat must be considered: For as hit is before said / in
somer we must use a small quantite of meat / at every meal: for than the
natural heat is feeble through the over great resolutions. But in winter we
may eat a great deal of meat at a meal. For tha^ the virtue digestive is
strong / when the natural heat is vnied / through circu^stant cold as we
said at Temporibus veris etc. The.v. is / how often we should eat in a day:
For in somer we must eat oftener than in winter: in autumpne and ver a
little at each meal / as is before said. Like wise / if the virtue digestive
be weak / we must eat little and often: but if the virtue digestive be
strong / we may eat much / and make few meals. Syxtlye / the eating place
must be considered: which should not be to hot nor to cold / but temperate.

Ius ca^lis soluit / cuius substantia restringit.
Vtraque quando datur / venture laxa^e paratur.
This text declares.iij. things. The first is / that the brothe of
colewortis / and specially the first brothe if they be sodde / leuseth the
bealy: by reason that in the leaves and utter partis of colewortis / is a sopy
scouring virtue / weakly cleuynge / and lightly separable by small decoction
or boylynge: which spredde abroad by the same water is made laxatiue. And this
is ye skele that the first water colewortis be sodde in / laxe rather than the
second. The.ij. is / that the substance of colewortes / after they are boiled
/ restrayneth the bealy: by reason that all their virtue laxatiue is taken away
by the decoction: and the erthye dry substance remains / which byndeth ye
womb. The.iij. is / that both taken to gether / the brothe and substance of
colewortis / leuse the bealye: by reason the scouring sopy virtue remains in
ye water / which leuseth all. And note that colewortis engendre melancoly
humors / and ill dreams / they hurt the stomach / norishe little / duske
the sight / cause one to dream / and they provoke menstruosite and urine / as
Auicen and Rasis say. Farther more note / that colewortis / the decoction or
sede thereof / keep one from dronkennes / as writes Aristottell.iii. partic.
problem. asking for what skele colewortis keep one from dronkennes. And this
thing is affirmed of Auicen and Rasis. The reason / as some think / is the
gross fumes / Auicen.ii. canone. Rasis.iii. Almansol.
that by eating of colewortis are lyfted up to the brain / engrossynge the
fumosites of the wine / which engrossynge let them to enter to ye brain.
Aristotell in the foresaid place says / that al thing that draws to hit the
moystnes of the wine / expellethe hit from the body / and that coleth the body
/ keeps hit from dronkennes: cole wortes are of such nature / ergo etc. And
that colewortis are of this nature / he prouethe thus: By the ieuse of
colewortis / the undigested humidites of ye wine / are drawn from all the
body in to the bladder: and through it coldness left in the stomach / which
coleth all the body / the persynge thereof is fordone. And so by this mean it
kepethe a man sobre. For the subtle superfluites that naturally could not
discende / by reason the heat of the wine stereth them to ascend upward
toward ye brain: are repressed down / and by virtue of this ieuse drawn to
the bladder.

Dedixerunt maluam veteres / quia molliat aluum.
Malue radices rade dedere feces.
Vulue nocuerunt / et fluxum sepe dederunt.
(...)e^.
Here are put.iij. propretes or effectis of malowes. First / malowes mollify
the bealy. For hit is one of them that mollie. There be.iiij. that mollify:
malowes and double malowes / branca / vrsina / and mercury / of which most
commonly clisters be made / to mollify al indurate and hard mattier in man.
There be.ij. sortis of mallows: the one bearethe a bludde read flower / the
other a white flower: and this of hit proprete does mollify more than ye
first. The.ij. effect of mallows is / yt malowe rootis shaued / and
suppositories made of them / such as phisitia^s are wont to make of mercury /
draw out of man the indurate matter and dregs / The.iij. effect is /
malowes cause the me^struous flixe in women / and that through the great
moystynge and slipperines thereof: whereby ye veins about the matrice sone pour
out / as Platearius says / and as appears by experience.

Mentitur menta / si sit depellere lenta.
Ventris lumbricos / stomachi vermesque nociuos.
Here the auctour says / that a mynte should not be called a mynte / outcepte
it have might to kylle worms in the bealy and stomach. A mynte has a great
strong savor / and is right bitter: and therefore as worm wodde kills
worms so does the mynte. And ye ieuse thereof / as of wormewod / must be
drunk and not the substance. Yet note / because hit is hot and dry /
burning the blud / hit is unwholesome in way of meat in the regiment of health.
But yet in medicines / it is wholesome / for hit comfort the stomach / and
heateth hit / and stynteth yexynge and digesteth / and prohibitethe vomit
flematike and sanguine: and through inflation stereth to bodily lust / and
prohibiteth spittynge of bludde: hit is very wholesome against bytynge of a mad
dog: and if ye crymble mynt in to milk / hit will never turn to make a
chese / as Auicen says.ii. can. cap. de menta.

Cur moritur homo / cui saluia crescit in horto?
Contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis.
Saluia confortat neru^s / manumque tremorem
Tollit / et eius open febris acuta fugit
Saluia / castoreum lauendula / premula veris
Nastur athanasia sanant paralitica membra.
Saluia saluatrix natura consiliatrix.
In this text ye author touches principally.iiij. things. First he shows
the greatte vtilite of sage / asking as though he doubted: The bou^te of sage.
wherefore man diethe / that has sage growing in his gardeyne. He answers in
the.ij. verse / that no medicine growyng in the gardeyn can withstand death al
though in the gardeyne grow medicines that keep the body from putrefaction /
and defend that natural humidite be not lightly consumed away / as techeth
Auicen / Auic. iii.i. ^p. sing.
saying: The science of physic does not make a man immortal / nor hit does
not surely defend our bodies from outward hurt full thingis: nor can not
assure every man to live to the last term and day of his life: but of.ij.
things hit makethe us sure / that is from putrefaction and corruption: and
defends that natural moisture be not lightly disolued and consumed. Secondly
/ he puttethe.iij. effectis of sage. The first is / The ver^ue of sage
that sage comfort the senowes: for it driethe the humidites / by which the
senowes be let and leused. The.ij. is / hit takes away the shaking of the
hands: by reason that it comfort the senowes / as is said / now all
thing co^fortynge the senowes / remoueth trembling / for trembling comethe
of feebleness of the senowes. And therefore some old men and women specially put
sage leaves in their meat and drink. Thirdly sage lets the sharp ague to
assail us: by reason that hit driethe humors / hit lets them to putrify /
whereby a sharp fever might be engendered. Farther note / that sage is hot and
dry / and therefore hit is not very wholesome alone in way of meat. Yet
because sage comfort the senowes greatly / folks in health use hit much.ij.
manner of ways. Sage. Wine.
First they make sage wine: which they drink specially at begynny^ge of
dinner or souper. This wine is wholesome for them yt have the palsy or falling
sickness / moderately taken / and after the purgation of the accident mattiers.
Secondly they use sage in sauces: for it ste^ethe up a ma^s appetite / and
specially when the stomach is full of ill humors / raw and undigested. There
is.ij. kinds of sage. One yt has great broad leaves. Two kindis of sage
An other commonly called noble sage / whose leaves be more narowe and less:
phisitio^s call it silifagus. Thyrdly thautour reherseth.vj. medicines good for
the palley. Hit is said / that sage / castorie / that is a castors stones /
lauander / primerose / wattercresse / and tansey / cure and heal members
enfect with palsy. Why sage does help it we have showed / for hit comforts
ye senowes / which by palsy be weaked. And eke because sage is hot and dry
/ it consumes the flematike matter remaining in the senowes / whereof ye
palsy grows. And that castorie is wholesome for the palsy appears by that
hit is most comfortable / heatynge and dryenge of the senowes: For Auicen
says thereof / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de castoreo.
that hit is subtiler and stronger than any other that heateth and dries. And
after he says / that hit comfort and heateth the senowes / the shaking /
the moist crampe / and benomed members caused of the palsy. And eke he says:
there is nothing better for ventosite in the ear / tha^ to take as much as a
pease / and tempre it with oil of spike / and so let it drop in to the ear.
Castorie has many other virtues which Auice^ reherseth. Castoriu^ is the
stones of a see beast called castor. The oil also of Castorie is as specially
good for the palsy / as castorie after voidynge of the matter: for than hit
consumes the resydue of the mattier that remains / and comfort the
senowes. Of laue^der apereth: For with hit sweet savor / it comfort the
senowes / and with hit heat does consume the palsy mattier. And also of the
primerose eke appears / for with hit sweet savor and heat / hit comfortethe
the senowes. This flower is called premula veris / because hit is the first
sweet flower that spryngeth in ver. The.v. is a watter cresse / for hit is
hot / dry / subtle / incisiue / and resolutiue: whereby it takes away ye
mattier of palsy / And Auicen says / hit comfort all mollification of the
senowes / for hit heateth / and drawethe out fleme / and cleanses the senowes
from fleme: and physicians counsel us to eat water cressis in lent because
lenten meat is flematike. Watercresse is a common herb growyng in cold /
stony / and watrishe places / where as be many well springes. The.vj. is tansey:
The virtue of this herb is to purge fleme / and with it heat dries the
senowes. Also hit purgethe a man of worms / and the mattier whereof they be
engendered. And therefore french men use commonly to fry eggs therewith in ye
ester weke / to purge away the fleme / engendered of fyshe in the lent: whereof
worms are soon engendered in them thereto disposed. In the end of the text
the auctour says / that sage is called the sauer and keeper of nature.

Nobilis est ruta / quia lumina reddit acuta.
Auyilio rute vir quippe videbis acute.
Ruta viris coitum minuit / mulieribus auget.
Ruta facit castum / dat lumen / et ingerit estum.
Cocta facit ruta de pulicibus loca tuta.
This text declares.iiij. propretes of rue. iiii. propretes of rue Auicen.ii.
can. ca. de ruta.
First hit sharpeth the sight / and proprely the ieuse thereof / as Auicen
says: and as is before said at Allea nux ruta. The.ij. is / rewe diminishethe
ye desire of carnal lust in men / but in women rewe augmenteth hit: by reason
that rue by hit heatynge and dryenge diminishes the sede of me^ / which is
subtle and of the nature of the air / but in women rue makes subtle and
heatethe the sede: for in them hit is wattrishe and cold: and therefore hit
sterethe them more to carnal lust. The.iij. is / rewe makes a man quick /
subtle / and inuentife: by reason that by heatynge and dryenge / hit makes a
man's spiritis subtle / and so clerethe the wit. The.iiij. is / that the
water that rue is sodde in / To kylle flees.
cast and sprinkeled about the house / riddeth away flees / and as physicians
say / it kylleth them. And after Auicen: when the house is sprinkeled with the
water of wild gourdes / the flees lepe and flee away: And like wise does the
water that black thorn is sodde in. And after Auicen says / Auice^.vi.iiii.
tract. iii. cap. de effug. pulicum.
that some have said / if goottis bludde be put in a pyt in the house / the
flees will gether there unto and dye. And like wise if a logge be anointed
with the grease of an yrchyn / ye flees will gether thereto and dye. Flees can
not abide the savor of colewortis / nor leaves of Oleandre. Some say / that
nothing is better to avoid flees than things of strong savor: and therefore
rewe / myntis / horse myntis / and hoppis be good / and above all thyngis horse
dounge orels horse stale is the chief. Also the house spryncled with ye
decoction of rape sede kylleth flees. And the parfumyng of ye house with a
bulls horn / driuethe away flees. Yet to take flees / nothing is better /
than to lay blankettis on the bed / for therein they gether them self.

De cepis medici non consentire videtur.
Colericis non esse bonas dicit Galienus.
Flegmaticis vero multum docet esse salubres.
(...)
Presertim stomacho. pull chrumque creare colorem.
Contritis cepis loca denudata capillis.
Sepe fricans poteris capitis reparare decorem.
(...)
Here the auctour speaks of oynions / and declares.v. things. First /
touching their operation physicians agree not: For some say they be good for
flematike folks: and some say nay / as Rasis / which says / that they
enge^dre superfluous and flematyke humors in the stomach. Secondly / Galen
says / they be right hurtful for colerike folks: because as Auice^ says /
oynio^s be hot in the third degree: and therefore they hurt hot folks / as
colerike be. Thirdly oynio^s be wholesome for flematike folks: For they be hot /
persynge / subtle / scouring / and openyng / wherefore they digest / cut /
make subtle / and wype away fleumatike and cla^my humors / grown in the
fleumatike folks. Fourthly / oynions be wholesome for the stomach / for they
mundifie hit from fleme / and heat hit. And therefore Auicen says / that hit
/ that is eat of the oynion / through the heat thereof comfortethe a weak
stomach. And eke therefore they make a man well colered: For it is impossible
for one to have a lyuelye coler / if his stomach be very fleumatike / or
filled with ill / raw / and flematike humors. The.v. is / oynions sodde and
stamped / restore hears again / if the place where ye hears were / be rubbed
therewith. This is of truth / when the hear gothe away through stoppynge of
the pores / and corruption of the mattier under the skin. For the oynions
open the pores / and resolve the ill mattier under ye skin / and draw good
mattier to he same place. And therefore / as Auicen says / often rubbyng with
oynions is very wholesome for balde men. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de preal. Et
vii.iii. ca. de curatio^e alo perie.
Wherefore the text concludethe / that this rubbing with oynions prepares ye
beauty of the heed: for hears are ye beauty of the heed. For a farther
knowledge of oynious operation / witteth / that they stere to carnal lust /
provoke the appetite / bring color in the face / myngled with honey they
distroy wartes / they engendre thyrste / they hurt the understanding (for
they enge^dre an ill gross humor) they encreace spittell / and the ieuse of
them is good for wattrynge eyes / and does clarify the syghte / as Auicen
says. Farther note / that oynions / honey / and vinegar stamped to gether / is
good for bytynge of a mad dog. And therefore some add these.ij. verses unto
the forsayde text. Appositas perhibent morsus curare caninos.
Si trite cum melleprins fuerint et aceto.
But of this is spoken before at Allea nux. etc.

Et modicum granum / siccum / calidumque sinapis.
Dat lachrymas / purgatque caput / tol^tque venenu^.
Here the auctour touchethe.ij. things. First he puts the co^plexio^ of
mustarde sede / of mustard sede.
saying / that mustarde sede is a little grain hot and dry: which is
true: for it is hot and dry unto the.iiij. degree after Auicen.ii. canone.
cap. de sinapi. Secondly / he puts.iij. propretes or effects of mustarde
sede. The first is / it makes ones eyes to water: For with hit greatte heat
/ hit makes subtle and leusethe the humidites of the brain: whereof than by
their flowynge to the eyes / the tears come. The.ij. effect is / hit purgethe
the brain / mundifienge and clensynge away the flematike humidites of the
heed. Also hit purgethe the heed / put in to the nose thyrllis / by hit
mordication prouokyng one to nese. And therefore hit is put in their nostrils /
yt have apoplexy / for by reason of nesynge the brain is pourged. And like
wise mustarde sede / through it great heat / does dissolve and leuse such
flemes as stop the cundites of ye brain: of which follows apoplexy: And
thus hit apperethe / that mustarde sede is a great leuser / consumer / and
clenser of flematike humidites. The.iij. effect is / hit withstandethe poison:
Auice^. loco prealleg.
For Auicen says / that venomous worms can not abide the smoke of mustarde
sede.

Crapula discutitur / capitis dolor / atque grauedo.
Purpuream dicunt violam curare caducos.
The prophets of (...).
Here are put.iij. propretes or effectis of violettis. First / violettis delay
dronkennes: by reason that violettis / have a temperate sweet savor / which
greatly comforts the brain: For a strong brain is not lightly over come
with drink / but a weak is. Also a violet is cold / wherefore hit colethe the
brain: and so makes hit unable to receive any fume. The.ij. is / violettis
slaketh heed ache and grefe / that is caused of heat / as Auicen / Rasis Alma.
and Mesue say: by reason that violettis be cold / they withstand hot
causes. The.iij. is / violettis help them yt have the falling syckenes. Though
some say thus / yet this effect is not commonly ascribed unto violettis. And
therefore if violettis have this proprete / hit is but by reason of their sweet
smell / that comforts the brain: which strengthed / is not hurt by small
geefes: and consequently falls not in to epilencie (which is called the
little apoplexy / chaunsynge by stoppynge of the sensible senowes.

Egris dat somnum / vomitum quoque tollit ad vsum.
Compescit tussim veterem / colicisque medetur.
Pellit pulmonis frigus / ventrisque tumorem.
Omnibus and morbis subueniet articulorum.
This text openethe.vij. propretes of nettyls. First nettyls cause a sick
body to sleep. For hit is subtiliatiue / cuttynge / and scouring of fleme and
gross humors / greuynge nature and lettynge sleep. Secondly it does away
vomit / and custom thereof: by reason that vomit and parbrakyng is caused of
a cla^my humor / which the nettel cutteth. Thyrdly / the nettell fordothe
old coughe: and specially honey / wherein nettell sede is tempered. For the
nettell auoydethe cla^mye fleme out of the breast / as Rasis says. Auic. ii.
ca^. cap. de vt.
And Auicen says of the nettell: that when hit is drunk / with water is is /
ther^yll drunk with wine / healethe the bealy ache: For hit asswageth
inflasion caused of gross ventosite / whereof the ache comes / for hit leuseth
ventosite of the stomach and all other guttis / and opens stoppynge / and
there unto the wine helps. Thyrdely / cherfyil cessethe vometynge and the
laske: by reason hit is hot in the.iij. degree / and dry in the.ij. it
digesteth / and dries that mattier whereof vomit comes. And this is very
truth / when vomit or the laske come of cold flematike mattier. And besides
these effectis / hit provoke urine and the menstruosite / and swageth ache of
the sides and raynes / and specially taken with mellicratum. Enula campana
reddit precordia sana.
Cum succo rute / si succus sumitur huius.
Asfirmat ruptis nil esse salubrius istis.
Here the text opens.ij. effectis of enula ca^pana. Elfe doc^e ^worte or
horse ^ele.
First / hit comfort the heart string / that is / the brymme of the
stomach is proprely called the heart stringis / orels the vital members / that
is / the wyndye members / which be nere the heart / and specially the heart
rote. That hit comfort the brymme of the stomach appears / in that the
sweet smellyng rote of enula comforts the senowy me^bres. The bry^me of the
stomach is a senowye membre. That hit comfort breathy members appears. For
wine made of enula / called vinum enulatum / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de enula.
cleanses the breaste / and lyghtis / or longes / as Auice^ says. Also enula
swalowed down with honey / helps a man to spytte: and it is one of those
herbs / that rejoice and comfort the heart. The.ij. effect is / the ieuse of
this herb / with the ieuse of rue / is very wholesome for them yt be burste /
and that is specially wha^ the burstennes comes by ventosite: for these.ij.
ieuses dissolve that. And besidis these effectis / enula is good for a stomach
/ filled with ill humors: and it opens opilatio^s of the liver and spleen /
as Rasis says. And hit comfort all hurtis / cold grefes / and motions of
ventosites / and inflasions / as Auicen says.

Cum vino coleram nigram potata repellit.
Sic dicunt veterem sumptum curare podagram.
Here are put.ij. effectis of hill worte. A remedy for coler.
First hill worte / and principally the water thereof taken with wine / purges
black coler. Secondly / hilwort / heleth an old gout. For the proprete of
this herb is to melte and dissolve fleme: whereof / very often / the gout is
wont to be engendered. And note / that after Platearius / hill worte is hot
and dry in the third degree. The substance thereof is subtle / the virtue
comfortable / through the sweet smell / of hit substance hit openethe / and of
hit qualites draws: of hit fyrie substance or nature / hit consumes / by
burning and drienge.

Illius succo crines retinere fluentes
Alitus asseritur / dentisque curare dolorem.
Et squamas succus sanat cum melle perunc^us.
Here he puttethe.iij. effectis of water cresses. water cresses.
First / watercresses reteyne hears / falling away / if the heed be
anointed with the iewse thereof / orels if the ieuse or water thereof be drunk.
This effect Auicen touches saying: Aui. ii. ca^. cap. de (...).
The drynky^ke or annoyntyng with watercressis cure tothe ache: specially if
the ache come by cold: for it persethe / resoluethe / and heatethe / as
apperethe at Cur moriatur homo. Thyrdly / ye ieuse of water cresse taken with
honey / or the place anointed therewith / does away skales that cleave to ones
skin: by reason yt such skales be engendered of salt fleme. Watercresse as
is said / purges all fleme: therefore if hit be drunk / hit resists the
cause of skales: and the place anointed therewith auoydeth the skales / and
specially myngled with honey: for that is a cle^ser / and so helps the cressis
to purge. Beside these effectis / cressis dry up the corruption of the bealy /
cleanses the lyghtis / heateth the stomach and liver / and is wholesome against
the grosnes of the spleen: proprely wha^ thereof and honey / a plaster is made /
it causes one to cast up coler / hit augmenteth carnal lust: and by
dissoluynge auoydeth out worms / and provoke menstruosite / as says Auicen.

Cecatis pullis / ac lumina matter hyrundo /
Plinius vt scribit / quamuis sunt eruta / reddit.
of celendine.
Here is put one notable thing of Celendine. When young swalowes be blind /
the da^me brings celendine / and rubbeth their eyes / and makes them to see:
whereby the auctour shewethe / hit is wholesome for the sight. And this appears
plainly / since hit is commonly put in medicines against feebleness of syghte.
Celendine has ieuse and is well known. And why swalowes know it better tha^
other birds may be / by cause their young be oftener blind: swalowes donge
does make blind: and so the da^me do^geth some time in the yonges eyes / and
makes them blind. And after Platearie / celendine is hot and dry in
the.iij. degree. And of it qualites and substance / hit has virtue to dissolve
/ consume / and draw. And the rootis thereof stamped and sodde in wine / are
good to purge the heed / and woman's priuite from broken moist humors / if the
pacie^t receives the smoke thereof at the mouth / and after gargyse wine in ye
throat.

Auribus infusus vermes succus necat vsus.

Here thauctour reherseth.iij. things of wylowe. To kylle worms in ones
ears. Auicen.ii. can. ca. de salice.
First / the ieuse of wylowe poured in to ones ear / kylleth worms: by reason
of the stiptisite and dryenge thereof. And after Auicen nothing is better to
heal matterynge at the ears / than the ieuse of wylowe leaves. Secondly / the
rynde of wylowes / sodde in vinegar / does away wartes. And Auicen says /
wylowe ashes with vinegar / To void wartes.
draws up wartis by the rotis: by reason of ye ashes vehement drienge. Yet to
distroy wartis / nothy^g is better / tha^ to rub them with purslane. This
purslane does of hit proprete and not qualite / after Auicen. Thyrdlye /
Auicen.ii. can. ca. de portulaca.
wylowe flowers and ieuse of it fruit / lets the birth of a child: for
through hit stiptisite and drought / hit causes the child to be borne with
great pain.

Confortare crocus dicatur letificando.
of saffro^.
Membraque defecta confortat epar reparando.
Here are put certain wholesome things of saffro^. First / saffron comforts
man's body / in gladdyng it. And wytteth well / that saffron has such proprete
/ that if one take more thereof than he ought / hit will kylle him in reioysynge
or laughing. Auicen says / (...). ii. ca^. (...) de ^reco
that to take a dra^me and a half / will kylle one in reioysynge. Secondlye /
saffron comfortethe defective members / and principallye the heart. Hit
comfort eke the stomach / by hit stiptisite and heat: and for the same
cause restores the liver / and specially through hit stiptisite / which will
not suffer the liver to be disolued. Yet to use hit over much / induseth
parbrakynge / and marreth the appetite. Of this Auicen warnethe us / saying:
Hit causes parbrakynge and marreth the appetite / because it is contrary to
the sharpenes in the stomach / which is cause of appetite. Besides these
propretes / faffron makes one sleep / and dullethe the wits / and when hit
is drunk with wine / hit makes one drunk / it cleanses the eyes / and
lettethe humors to flow to them / hit makes one to breath well / it stereth
to carnal lust / and makes one to pysse.

Flegma vires modicas tribuit / latosque breuesque.

Hic somnus lentus / piger / in hac sputamine mul^us.
Et qui sensus habes pingues / facit color albus.
This text shows certain propretes of the co^plexio^ of fleme. First /
flematike folks be weak / by reason that their natural heat / which is
begynner of all strength and operation / is but feeble. Secondly / flematike
folks be short and thycke: for their natural heat is not strong inoughe to
length the body: and therefore hit is thycke and short. Thirdly / flematike
folks be fat / because of their great humidite. Therefore Auicen says / that
superfluous grese signifies cold and moistnes: For the bludde and the
unctious mattier of grese / persynge through the veins in to the cold members
(through coldness of the members) do conieile to gether / and so engendre in
man much grese / as Galen says in his.ij. book of operation. He says after
/ that sanguine men are myddell bare between the long and the short. Fourthly
/ flematike folks are more inclined to ydelnes and study than folks of other
complexion: by reason of their coldness / that makethe them sleep. Fyftlye /
they sleep longer / by reason of their great coldness / that provoke them to
sleep. Syxtelye / they be dull of wit and understanding: for as temperate
heat is cause of good wit and quick under sta^dyng: so cold is cause of
blu^t wit and dull understanding. Seue^thly / they be slouthful / and that is
by cold: for as heat makes a man light and quick in mouyng: so cold makes
a man heavy and slouthful. The.viij. is / they be lumpyshe and sleep long.

Reddit fecundas permansum sepe puellas.

This text opens.i^. co^modites of lekes. First often eating of lekes make
young women frutfull: Of lekes.
by reason as Auicen says / Auicen.ii. can. ca. de porro.
lekes delate the matrice / and takes away the hardness thereof: which lets
the conception. Secondly lekes stynce bledynge at the nose / as Auicen says.
Many other effectis of lekes are rehearsed at Allea nux ruta.

Quod piper est nigrum non est dissoluere pigrum.

Lencopiper stomacho prodest / tussisque dolori.
Vtile preueniet motum febrisque rigorem.
Pepper.
This text declares many co^modites of pepper: and first.iij. of black pepper.
First / black pepper / through hit heat and drines / leuseth quickly: for
it is hot and dry in the.iij. degree. Secondly / hit purges fleme: for it
draws fleme from the inner part of the body / and consumes hit. Like wise
hit auoydethe fleme out that cleuethe in the breast and stomach / heatynge /
subtilynge and dissoluynge hit. Thyrdly / hit helpethe digestion. And this
appears by Auice^ / Auic. ii. ca^. cap. de pi^.
saying: that pepper is digestive causynge appetite. And this specially is to
be understand by long pepper: which is more wholesome to digest raw humors
tha^ either white or black / Gal. iii. de reg. sanitatis. ca. vii.
as witnesses Galen. Secondly / he declares.v. wholesome things of white
pepper. First / white pepper comfortethe the stomach. And this appears by
Galens words / saying: that hit comforts ye stomach more than ye other.ij.
To this agrees Auicen / Auic. loco preal^eg.
saying: white pepper is more wholesome for the stomach: and more vehemently
does comfort. The.ij. is / pepper is wholesome for the coughe / specially
caused of cold fleumatike mattier / for hit heatethe / dissoluethe / and
cutteth hit. To this Auicen assenteth / saying: When pepper is ministered in
lectuaries / it is wholesome for the coughe / and aches of the breaste. Thyrdely
/ white pepper is wholesome for ache / and that is to wit of the breaste / and
ve^tous pain. And for that all pepper is good: for all pepper is a dimynysher
and a voyder of wind. And Auicen says: that white pepper and long is
wholesome for prickynge ache of the bealye / Against belyache.
if hit be drunk with honye and fresh baye leaves. Fourthly / pepper
withstandeth the causes of a cold fever / for it digesteth and heateth the
mattier. Fyftly / white pepper is wholesome for a shaking fever / by reason that
pepper with it heat comfort ye senowes / and consumes the mattier spredde
on them. And Auicen says in rubbing it is made an oyntme^t (with vnguentum)
wholesome against shaking. These.v. propretes are ascriued to ye other ky^des of
pepper / as Auice^ says. And beside these effectis / pepper heteth the senowes
and braunes of man's body: it mundifieth the lightis / and a little thereof
provoke the urine / but much leuseth ye bealy / as says Auicen. There
be.iij. sortis of pepper / white pepper / called lencopiper / long pepper /
called macropiper / and black pepper / called melancopiper. Hit is called
white pepper that is very grene and moist: and when it is a little dried / and
not perfectly ripe / hit is called long pepper. But when hit is perfectly ripe
/ hit is called black pepper.

Et mox post escam dormire / nimisque moueri.
Ista grauare solent auditus ebrietasque.
Hurtefull to the herynge.
Here are touched.iij. things that grieve the heryng. The first is / immediate
sleep after meat / and that is if one eat his fill. For the immediate sleep
will not suffer the meat to digeste: and of meat undigested are engendered
gross undigested fumes: which with their grossenes stop the cundites of
heryng: and eke they engrosse and trouble the spiritis of herynge. The.ij. is
to much mouynge after meat: for that also lets digestion / and the due
shutting of the stomakes mouth: by reason that than the stomakes mouth
closes not so easily / as by a little walkyng / whereby the meat discendethe
to the bottum of the stomach. For wha^ the stomach is not shut / many fumes
ascend to the heed / that grieve the herynge. The third is dronkennes / whereof
many fumes and vapors are engendered / which asce^de to the heed / and organ
of herynge / troublyng the spirit thereof / and greuynge the herynge. And
dro^kennes does not only hurt the herynge / but also the syghte / and all the
sensis / for the same cause / as is before said. Auice^.iiii.^ii. cap. ii. de
conseruat. sanit. auris.
There be.iij. things / as Auicen says / that hurt the ear and other
senses / lothynge / repletion / and sleep after repletion. And some text has
this verse: Balnea / sol / vomitus / affert repletio clamor. Which things
grieve the herynge / but specially great noise. For Auicen says / if we will
here well and naturallye / we must eschew the son / laborious baynynge /
vomit / great noise / and repletion.

Metus / longa / fames / vomitus / percussio / casus.
Ebrietas / frigus / tinnitum causat in aure.
Here are touched.vij. things / which cause a hummynge and a noise in ones
ear. The first is / fear / and after some / motion. The cause is / for in
fear / the spiritis and humors crepe inward toward the heart sodaynlye: by
which motion ventosite is lightly engendered / which entering to the organ of
the hearing causes tyngynge or ryngynge in the ear. By corporal mouynge
also humors and spiritis are moved / of which motion ventosite is lightly
engendered / which coming to the ears causethe ryngynge. For ryngynge is
caused through some mouynge of a vapor or ventosite about the organ of the
heryng / mouynge the natural air of those pipes contrary to their course.
The.ij. is great hunger: Auice^.iiii.iii. cap. ix.
Auicen shows the reason saying: that this thing cha^cethe through humors
spredde and resting in man's body. For when nature fyndeth no meat / she is
converted unto them / and resoluethe and moves them. The.iij. is vometynge:
For in vometynge / which is a laborious motion / humors are specially moved
to the heed. In token whereof we se the eyes and face come read / and the
syghte hurt. And thus also by vometyng / vapors and ventosites are soon
moved to thorgan of the herynge. The.iiij. is often beatynge about the heed /
specially the ear. For thereby chances vehement motion of the natural air /
being in the organ of the herynge. For when any membre is hurt / nature is
hurt. The.iiij. is the wind / and specially the southe. Hippoc. apho. illo.
^as^rini flatus etc.
Whereof Hippocrates says: the southe wind is mystye / and duskethe the eyes:
for that wind fyllethe the heed with humidites / which dulle the wyttis and
dark the syghte. The.v. is pepper / which through ye sharpenes thereof /
engendrethe fumes that byte the eyes. The.vj. is garlyke / which also hurts
the eyes / through it sharpenes and vaporosite / as is said at Allea nux.
The.vij. is smoke / which hurtethe the eyes / through hit mordication and
drienge. The.viij. is lekes: For by eating of them / gross melancolye fumes
are engendered: whereby the syghte is shadowed / as is before said / at Allea
nux ruta. etc. The.ix. is oynions / the eating of which hurtethe the eyes /
through their sharpenes. The.x. is lens / the much eating whereof / as Auicen
says / dusketh the syghte / through the vehement dryenge thereof. The.xj. is to
much weeping: which weakethe the eyes / for hit causes debilite retentiue of
the eyes. The.xij. is beans: the use whereof engenders a gross melancoly fume
/ darkynge the visible spiritis / as lekes do. And therefore the eating of
beans / inducethe dredefulle dreams. The.xiij. is mustarde / the use whereof
febleth the sight through hit tartnes. The.xiiij. is to look against the son:
and that is through the vehement splendor and bryghtenes thereof: whereby the
syghte is distroyed: as apperethe by experience. For the vehement sensiblenes
of a thy^g / not proporcioned to man's sense / as the son beams / corrupt
man's sense. The.xv. is to much carnal copulation / and specially after
greatte fedynge or repletion / or after great voidy^g or emptines: but this is
all redye declared. The.xvj. is fire / the beholdynge whereof / causethe
vehement drines in the eyes / and so hurts the syghte: and eke the bryghtnes
thereof hurtethe the eyes. And therefore we se co^monlye / that smythes and such
as work before the fire / be read eied and feeble sighted. The.xvij. is to
great labor / for that eke dries vehemently. The.xviij. is smiting upon the
eyes / which hurts the eyes and sight / for it makes them bludde shot /
and troubles ye vissible spirit: and other while engendrethe impostumes.
The.xix. is to much use of te^t or sharp things / as sauces: and that is
through the tertnes of fumes of them engendered. The.xx. is duste / or walkyng
in dusty places: in which duste flees light lyin to the eyes / and duskethe
the syghte. The.xxj. and above other hurtful to the eyes and sight / is to
much watch: For to much watch inducethe to much drynes in the eyes. And
generally all repletions hurt the eyes: and all that driethe up nature: and all
that trouble the bludde / by reason of saltnes or sharpenes. All dronkennes
hurts the eyes: but vometynge comforts the sight / in that hit purges the
stomach: and hurts hit / in that hit moves the mattiers of the brain /
dryuynge them to the eyes. And therefore if hit be needful to spue / hit must
be done after meat without constraynynge. Also to much sleep incontinent
after meat / and much bludde lettynge / and proprelye with ventosites /
hurtethe the syghte as Auicen says.iii. tract. iiii. ca. iiii. where he
expresses many of the forsayde causes.

Feniculus / verbena / rosa / celidonia / ruta /
Ex istis fit aqua / que lumina reddit acuta.
This text recitethe.v. herbs / whose water is very wholesome for the syghte.
To clarify the eyes.
The first is fenell / whose ieuse put in to the eye / sharpeth the syghte /
after Rasis.iij. Alm^. The.ij. is verueyn / whereof the water is of many
physicians put in resceytes wholesome against feebleness of syghte. The third is a
rose / whose water does comfort the lyuelye spirit and syghte. The.iiij. is
celendine / whose ieuse is citrine / hit is called celidonia / that is /
gyuynge celestial gifts. The.v. is rewe: ye water of those.ij. herbs is
wholesome for the syghte / as physicians commonly say.

Sic dentes serua / porrorum collige grana.
Ne careas iure cum iusquiamo simul ure.
Sicque per embotum fumumque cape dente remotum.
Here the auctour recites certain medicines for tothe ache. For tothe ache.
He says / Lykes sede and henbane burned to gether / is good for the tothe
ache. They must be ministered on this wise: The ieuse of he^bane with the like
sede must be burned to gether: and the smoke must be resceiued through a fonell
/ on the side that the ache is. The virtue of the he^bane takes away the
feeling of the pain. And the virtue of ye like seeds fume kylleth worms:
which other while lyenge in the concauites of ye tethe / cause intolerable
pain / as Auicen says / ii. canone cap. de porro.

Nux oleum / frigus capitis / anguillaque potus.
Ac pomum crudum faciunt hominem fore raucum.
This text declares.vj. causes of horsenes. The first is eating of nuttis:
for nuttis dry much: and therefore they asperate the voice / and make it like
a cranes voice. The.ij. is oil / the use whereof may engendre horsenes: for
some cla^my partis thereof cleue fast to the pipe of the lyghtis / causy^g
horsnes. Secondly / hit may make colerike folks hoorse for that in them ye
oil is lightly enflamed / and so that inflammation causes exasperation and
horesnes: but the first cause seems better. The third is cold of the heed:
For cold of the heed does press to gether the brain: whereby the humors
discende toward the throat / and the pype of the lyghtis: enducynge horsenes /
through to much moystnes of the pipe. The.iiij. is eating of yeles: for the
eating of them multiplieth cla^my fleme: which coming to the lyghtis /
stycke there still / and cause horsnes. The.v. is over much drinking /
specially toward bed. Now the vehement wetynge of the pipe of the lightis
/ does chieflye cause horesnes of the voice / as all physicians say. The.vj.
is raw apuls / for in that they be raw they encreace fleme: and if they be
not ripe / but sharp and sower / they make the throat roughe.

Ieiuna / vigila / caleas dape / valde labora.
Inspira calidum / modicum ^ibe / comprime flatum.
Hec been tu serna si vis de pellere reuma.
Si f^nat ad pectus / dicatur reuma catarrus.
Ad fauces branchus / ad nares esto corisa.
Here are touched.vij. things that cure ye reume. The first is abstinence
from meat / ^or the (...).
or fasting / for thereby the mattier of reume is dimynyshed: for abstinence
dries / and the mattier is better ryped and consumed: For when nature fyndethe
no matter of food / whereon she may work: she works upon reumatike mattier
and consumes hit: and so the heed is less filled therewith. Wherefore Auicen
says: that a man having the catar or the pose / should take heed he fylle
not him self with meats. The.ij. is watch: for watch dries the brain /
and withstandeth that ye vapors ascend not to the heed. The.iij. is hot
meatis and drynkes: for through their heat the cold mattier of the reume is
digested. The.iiij. is to labor much: for thereby the mattier reumatike is
consumed: by reason that much labor dries up ye superfluites of the body.
And instead of val^e some textis have vest: and than the sentence is / that
warm garme^tis is wholesome for the reume / specially when hit comes by cold
mattier. The v. is inspirynge of hot aier / and specially if the catarre
proceed of cold matter: for by breathyng of warm aier / the mattier is warmed
and riped. The.vj. is to drink little and endure thyrst: for thereby the
reumatike mattier is consumed. And eke by little drinking the heed is not
filled as with much drinking. The.vij. is to hold ones breath: for that is
specially good in a catarre / caused of a cold mattier: by reason that this
holdy^g of the breathe heatethe the partis of the breast: and so the cold
fleumatike mattier / causynge the catarre / is better digested. These things
and many other Auicen touches / saying: Auice^. loc^ prealleg.
Hit behouethe to keep the heed warm continuallye. And also hit must be kept
from the north wind / and proprely after the southe. For the southe wind /
repleteth and makethe rare. The north wind / constrayneth. Also he must
drink no cold water: nor sleep on the day time: He must endure thyrst /
hunger / and watch: as much as he can: for these things in this sickness are
the beginning of health. Rasis.ix. Almauso^.
Farther more Rasis bids him yt has ye reume / to beware of lyenge up
right. For by lyenge up right the reumatike matter flows to the hinder
partis of man / where as be no manifest issues / whereby the mattier may void
out: Therefore hit is to be feared lest hit flow to the senowes / and cause the
crampe or palsy. And like wise he ought utterly to forbear wine: for wine is
vaporous: and in that hit is very hot / it dissolueth the mattier / and
augmenteth the reume: And like wise he must not stand in the son nor by the
fire: for the son and fire leuse the mattier and augmenteth the reume. In the
last.ij. verses thauctour puttethe difference between these.iij. names /
catarrus / branchus / and corisa. And the difference stands in ye mattier
flowyng to one part or an other of the body: Wha^ the mattier ro^nethe to the
breaste partis / hit is called catarrus: when hit ronneth by the nose / it is
called corisa: when hit ronnethe to the neck / hit is called branchus. But
this word reume does note and signify generally all manner of mattier flowyng
from one membre to an other.

Auripigmentum sulphur miscere memento.
His decet apponi calcem commisce saponi.
Quattuor hec misce. commixtis quatuor istis.
Fistula curatur / quater ex his si repleatur.
Here the auctour puts a curable medicine for the fistule / For the fistule.
saying: that a plaster made of auripigmentum / brymstone / white lyme / and
soap myngled to gether heals the fistule. For these thyngis have virtue to
dry and mundifie: which ententions are requisite in healynge a fistule.
Platearie says / auripigmentum is hot and dry in the.iiij. degree: it
dissolueth and drawethe / consumethe / and mundifieth. Brymstone and soap as he
says / are hot and dry: but brymstone is more vehemente: for hit is hot
and dry in the.iiij. degree / but soap is not. Auicen says / that lyme
washed / dries without mordicatio^ / and makethe steddye. The fistule is a
rounnynge sore / which auoydeth mattier more or less / after the diversity
and course of the moon. Auripigme^tum is that ye grauers faste^ bras and other
metals with to stones.

Here thauctour nombreth the bones / tethe / and veins in man's body. First /
of bones.
he says there be CCxix. bones. Yet after the doctors of phisike / as
Hippocrates / Galen / Rasis / Auerroys / and Auice^ / the bones in man
be.CCxlviij. And though herin be variance / yet there is a master of physic
that says:

Ossa ducenta sunt / atque quater duodena. Secondly thauctour says / that a
man most commonly should have.xxxij. tethe. The no^bre of tethe.
But yet hit chances that some men lack.iiij. the last tethe: which be
behind them that we call the grynders: and these have but.xxviij. tethe. Some
lack these iiij. last tethe in child hod only: some other lack them till
they be very old: and some all their life. Aui. i. doct v. cap. de anoth.
de^denttum.
Here is to be noted / yt after Auicen / the.ij. foremost tethe be called
duales: and.ij. on either side of these twain / are called quadrupli. There
be.ij. in the upper iawe / and.ij. in the nether: al these tethe were ordained
to cut: and therefore some call them cutters / and specially the duales. Next
unto those quadruples / are.ij. tethe above / and.ij. benethe. called canini /
whose office is to break hard thingis. After those be.iiij. other on either
side called grynders.iiij. above and.iiij. beneth. After those some have a
tothe called sensus / on either side / and as well above as benethe. These also
are ordained to grynde man's meat. And so the holle nombre of ye tethe
is.xxxij. orels.xxviij. in them that have not ye tethe called sensus. There is
than.iiij. duales iiii. quadruples.iiij. dog tethe.xvj. grinders / and.iiij.
sensus. Thyrdly the text says / that there is in man CCClxv. veins / as
appears in the anothamie.

Quatuor hu^ores in humano corpore constant.
Sanguis cum colera / flegma / melancolia.
Terra melan. aqua / fleg. et aer / sanguis coler ignis.
Here the auctour declarethe the.iiij. humors in man / as bludde / fleme /
coler / and melancoly. And showing the nature and complexion of them / he
compares each to one of the.iiij. elements. Melancoly is cold and dry and
so compared to the earth / which is of like nature: Fleme is cold and moist /
and so compared to water. Bludde is hot and moist / and so compared to the
aier. Coler is hot and dry / and so compared to fire. These things are
declared in these verses.

Humidus est sanguis / calet / est yis aeris illi.
Alget / humet / flegma / sic illi yis sit aquosa.
Sicca calet colera / sic igni fit similata.
Melancolia friget / siccat quasi terra.
Aui. i. doct iiii. cap. i.
For a farther knowledge wittethe well / that after Auice^ / there be.iiij.
humors in ma^s body / blud / fleme / coler and melancoly / as is said. The
best of them is blud / first by reason hit is the mattier of man's spiritis: in
whom consistethe man's life and operations. Secondly because hit is comfortable
to the principles of life / hit is temperatlye hot and moist. Thyrdly /
because hit restores and nourishes the body more than the other humors: and
it is called the treasure of nature: for if hit be lost death follows forth
with. Next to bludde in goodness is fleme: First by reason that if need be /
hit is apt to be turned in to bludde. Secondly / because hit is very nere
like humidite / which is as fu^datio^ of life. After fleme in goodness is
coler: which is partner with natural hete so long / as it keeps convenient
measure. Than follows melancoly / as dregs and durte removed aparte from the
principles of life / ennemy to joy and liberalite / and of nere kynred to age
and death. Secondly note / that in the division of humors / there is.ij.
kinds of blud / that is to say / natural and unnatural. Natural blud is
ruddye: that is to say / vein bludde ruddye and obscure: and artery bludde
ruddye and clear: without ill savor: and in comparison of other humors / is
very sweet. Unnatural is double: the one is unnatural in qualite / that is to
say / which is changed from good complexion in it self: orels by myngly^ge of
an other humor. There is an other unnatural bludde / which through
mynglynge of other humors / is ill both in qualite / substance / quantite /
and in proportion of the one to ye other. And this is double: for the one is
not natural / by mynglyng of an ill humor / that comes to him from without.
The other is unnatural by mynglynge of an ill humor / engendered in the self
blud: as when part of the blud is putrified / and the subtle part thereof is
turned in to coler / and the gross part in to melancoly: orels that coler /
or that mela^coly / orels both remains in the blud. And this unnatural blood
/ by mynglynge of an ill humor / varieth from natural bludde many ways.
First / in substance: for hit is grosser and fouler: since mela^coly is myngled
therewith: orels hit is more subtle / when wattrishenes or citrine coler is
myngled therewith. Secondlye in color: for some time / when fleme is myngled
therewith / hit enclineth to whitenes / or through melancolye to blackenes.
Thirdly in savor: for by myngly^g of putrified humors hit is more stynkynge:
orels by mynglynge of raw humors hit has no savor. Fourthly in talage: for
by mynglyng of coler / hit enclineth to bitterness / and by melancoly to
sowernes / or by fleme to vnsauerynes. Also of fleme there be.ij. kinds /
natural and unnatural. Natural is that / which within a certain space will
be bloudde: for fleme is undigested bloudde. There is an other spice of fleme /
which is sweet and some what warm / if hit be compared to the bodily hete:
But comparynge hit to ruddye blud and coler / hit is cold. Fleme is naturally
white: and this is called sweet fleme / extendynge this name sweet to all the
talages delitynge the taste: for other wise this natural fleme is not sweet:
but unsavory and watrishe / and very nere the talage of water. And to this
fleme / nature has not given a propre mansion / as she has done to coler and
melancoly: but nature makes it run with the blood: for it has a very nere
similitude to blood. And of this fleme there be.ij. necessites and one vtilite.
The first necessite is / that hit be nere the members / so that their virtue
may digeste and turn hit in to bloudde: and that the members by hit may be
nourished / when they have lost their natural food / that is for to say /
good bloudde / through restrynte of material blood / which restreynt is
caused of the stomach and liver / through some causes accidental. The.ij.
necessite is / that hit myngle with the blood / and make hit apt to nourishe
the me^bres of flematike complexion / as the brain and nuche: for that that
must noryshe these me^bres / must be well myngled with fleme. The vtilite of
fleme is that hit moist the joints and members / that move much / lest they
wax dry through the heat that comes of their mouynge and rubbing.
Unnatural fleme may be divided. First in hit substance: and so some thereof is
muscillaginosu^: and that is fleme / to ones semynge / diverse: for in some
part it is subtle and thynne / and in some other gross and thycke: it is
called muscilaginosu^ / because hit is like muscilages / drawn out of seeds.
There is an other fleme that appears egall in substance / that is in subtilite
and grossenes to ones demynge: but for a troth hit is diverse in every part:
this is named raw fleme. And this encreasethe in ye stomach and entrayles. And
to avoid hit out of the stomach / Hippocrates byddethe us spue twyse a
monethe: and to void hit out of the guttis / nature has ordained coler to
run from the chest of the gall to the entrayle ieiuniu^ / and so forth to
the other lower guttis / to scour away that fleme from the brymmes of the
entrayles / and to cause hit to discende down with the other dregs and
fylthe. Some time this fleme is increased in the veins / specially of old
folks / by minishyng of their digestio^: and there remaining / is by little
and littell augmented and engrossed / hurtynge nature / which can not by the
veins / thereto ordained / void hit out / yet it does that is possible to keep
it from the heart / and other inward members: and drives it to the outward
members / and specially to the legs: for by hit heaviness hit naturally draws
to the lower partis of man: And this is the cause why old folks legs are
swollen / and that if one press down his finger therein / there taryethe a
hole: specially toward night / and in fat folks / and such as were wont
to be nourished with moist meats. There is an other spice of fleme / very
subtle / and wattrishe / like unto water / some what thick: This fleme is
very often myngled with their spittyll / that have ill digestion / and of
those that be great drinkers: it runs from ye brain to the nose / as hit is
wont in the beginning of the pose: and when by decoction and boylynge in man
/ hit comes gross / hit is turned in to fleme / gross / white / and
muscillage. There is an other fleme gross and white / called gipseum: the
subtle partis of this fleme is dissolved / through it long bydynge in the
iointis: and the grossenes thereof / remains in ye ioyntis as hard as stones.
This fleme enge^drethe a gout incurable. There is an other fleme thycke and
gross / like to molt glass / in color / cla^mynes and weight. Secondly
unnatural fleme differethe in talage: for there is certain fleme / yt is
sweet / which is by mynglynge of bludde with fleme. And under this is
contained the unctuous fleme: which is engendered by mynglynge of unctuous
blood and fleme. There is an other manner of unsavory fleme / caused of rawnes:
as certain glassy fleme. There is an other salt fleme / caused by mynglynge
of coler. And this is more bytynge / drier / and lyghter / tha^ any other fleme
/ through the coler / mingled therewith / which is dry light / and sharp. And
this fleme is often found in their stomakes / that be flematike / that drink
much strong wine / and that use salt and sharp meats / and cleuynge to the
stomakes / causes other while thyrst intolerable: and runnyng by the guttis /
hit some time flees them: and causethe the bluddy mensyn: and in the fundeme^t
often times induces strong ^o stiuenes. There is an other fleme that is sharp
by mynglynge of sharp melancolye therewith: and some time / through boylynge
of fleme: as hit chances in the sweet ieuses of fruits: that first boil /
and after wax ripe: And this fleme appears oftener in their stomakes that
digest ill / than in other partis. For naturally coler flows to the mouth of
the stomach / to stere up thappetite: which desce^dyng downewarde / some time
myngled with fleme / makes it sower: and this is perceived by sower
belchynges. And other while this fleme is engendered in the stomach by boyly^g
with a weak heat. There is an other fleme called pontike / which is some
time caused by mynglyng of po^tike melancoly. But this is seldom / by reason
that pontike melancolye is very scarce. Hit is some time caused through
vehement coldness thereof: whereby the moystnes thereof is co^ieyled / and some
what altered to erthynes: and thereupon comes no weak heat / which causynge
it to boil / should convert it in to sharpenes: nor no strong heat / which
digestyng hit / should turn it in to blud. There be.ij. kinds of coler /
natural and unnatural. Unnatural coler is the foam of blud / whose coler is
ruddy and clear / that is / citrine / in the last degree of citrines: as
saffron heedes: and hit is light and sharp: and the hotter the more read it
is. And after this coler is engendered in the heed / hit deuideth in two partis
/ one part gothe with the blood in to the veins / the other gothe in to the
purse of the galle. The part that gothe with the blood / enters therewith
both for necessite and profit. Hit is needful that hit myngle with the blood
/ to nourishe ye colerike me^bres. Hit is behoueful / that hit make the blood
subtle / and cause hit to enter in to the veins. The part that gothe to the
purse of the galle / gothe eke thither for necessite and profit. The necessite
is double. The one is needful for all the body / to mundifie hit from
colerike superfluites. The other necessite is in respect of the galls purse.
The profit also is double. The one is to wash ye entrayles from dregs / and
cla^my fleme / cleuynge to them. The other is to prick ye guttis and musculs /
that they may feel the thing that hurts them / and void all other
fylthynes. The proof of this is / that colike chances oftetymes by stoppynge
of the hole that comethe from the purse of ye galle to the guttis. Unnatural
coler is double. For one is unnatural through outward cause myngled there
with. The other is unnatural through a cause in it self: for the substance
thereof is not natural. Coler unnatural through an outward cause / is an
other known and famous: And hit is that that fleme is myngled with. And it is
called famous or notable: by reason hit is often engendered. And of this kind of
coler comes ye third / well known. There is an other yt is less famous / and
that is hit / wherewith melancoly is myngled Famous coler is either citrine /
and engendered by mynglynge of subtle fleme with natural coler / orels hit is
yolkye / like to yolks of eggs / and is engendered by mynglynge of gross
fleme with natural coler. Coler of less fame is caused.ij. ways. One is when
the coler is burned in hit self / and turned to ashes / from which the
subtle part of the coler is not separated / but myngled therewith. And this
coler is the worste. An other is / when melancoly comes from without / and
mynglethe hit with the coler. And this coler is better than other / and is
ruddye in color: hit is not clear nor flowynge / but more like to vein
bludde. This unnatural coler / having his own propre substance / without
mynglynge of any other humor / is often engendered in the liver: by reason that
the subtilnes of the blood burns hit self / and tourneth in to coler / and
grossly in to melancoly. An other coler there is / engendered in the stomach of
ill meatis not digested but corrupted: orels it is engendered in the veins by
other humors. And of this coler be.ij. kinds. For one is called coler
prassiue / like the color of ye herb called prassion: which is engendered of
the yolkynes when hit is burned: for ye burny^g causes a yolky blackenes i^ ye
coler / which myngled with coler citrine / enge^dreth a grene coler. The other
is called rusty coler / like to rusty iron: and it is engendered of passive:
wha^ prassiue is burned only till the humidite there of be dried away: and
through hit drines begins to wax white. And these.ij. last colers be ill
and venomous / and yet rusty is the worse. Like wise there be.ij. kinds of
melancolye / natural and unnatural. The natural is the dreggis and
superfluite of good blood / whose talage is between sweet and pontike. And this
melancoly / when hit is engendered in the liver / is parted in.ij. partis. Of
which one enters with the blood / and there with remains in the veins. The
other is conveyed to the spleen. The first part enters with the blood for
necessite and profit. Hit is needful that it myngle with the blood / to
norishe the melancoly / cold / and dry members / as the bones. The vtilite is
to make thycke the thynne blood / to stynte the superfluous runnynge thereof /
to make it strong / and to strength these members in to which hit must be
converted. The other part / that needs no blood / gothe to the spleen both
for necessite and profit. The necessite is double / one universal through
out the body / to purge hit of mela^colious superfluite. The other is but
particular / only to govern the spleen. This mela^coly is also profitable for
man's body / for hit runnethe to the mouth of the stomach / straynynge out the
humidites / that hit fyndeth there / as a woman straynynge a cowes dugges /
drawethe out the milk. This vtilite is double. First hit constrayneth /
thycketh / and comfort the stomach. Secondly / by reason it moves the
mouth of the stomach / through hit egernes / hit makes one have an appetite
and lust to meat. Unnatural mela^coly is as a thing burned or ashes in
respect of other humors. Of this there are.iiij. famous kinds / though there
be many not famous. The first is ashes of coler: and this is bitter. The.ij. is
ashes of fleme: and if the fleme that is burned were very subtle and
wattrishe: than the melancoly thereof engendered will be salt in talage. But if
the fleme be gross yt is burned: than the ashes thereof / or the melancoly of
hit engendered / enclyneth to sowernes or ponti^ite. The.iij. is ashes of blood
/ and this melancolye is last / a little drawing to swetenes. The.iiij. is
ashes of natural mela^coly. And if natural melancoly / whereof so it be / be
subtle: tha^ it will be very sower. And wha^ hit is cast out upon the ground
/ hit boyleth and sauoureth of the air / and causes both flies and beastis to
void the place. But if the natural melancoly be gross / the unnatural
thereof inge^dred / shall not be so sower.

Sanguine folks.
This text techeth us to know sanguine folks. First / a sanguine person is
naturally fat. But we may not understand / that sanguine folks be proprely
fat: for that is a token of a cold complexion / Auice^.ii.i. doct. iii. cap.
iii.
as says Auicen: But they be fat and fleshye with all: for fat in
sanguine persons is taken for fleshye. Auicen says: that abundance of ruddy
flesh and styffe / signifies a hot and a moist co^plexio^ / as a sanguine
person is. For thabu^dance of ruddy flesh / witnesses fortitude of virtue
assimilatiue / and multitude of blood / ye work and wax by heat and moisture
/ as witnessethe Galen / saying: Thabundance of flesh is engendered by
abundance of blood. For heat perfectlye digestynge / and the like virtue to
flesh makethe the flesh fast and styffe. Also Auicen says: every fleshye
body without abundance of fat and greece / is sanguine. Galen. ii. ^egni.
Whereto Galen asse^teth. Secondly / the sanguine person is merry and iocunde /
that is to say / with merry words he moves other to laugh: orels he is glad /
through benignite of the sanguine humor / provoking a man to gladness and
iocu^dite / through clear and perfect spirits engendered of blood. Thyrdly he
gladly hereth fables and merry sportis / for the same cause. Fourthlye he is
enclyned to lechery / through heat and moystnes / provoking to carnal
copulation. Fyftly / he gladlye drinks good wine. Sixtlye / he delyteth to
feed on good meat: by reason the sanguine person desyrethe the most like to
his complexion / that is good wynes and good meats. Seuenthlye / he laugheth
lightly / for blood provoke to laughy^g. The.viij. is / the sanguine person
/ has a gladsome and an amiable countenance / through lyuelynes of color /
and fairenes of complexion. The.ix. is / he speaks swetelye / through
amiablenes of sanguine nature. The.x. is / he is apt to learn any manner of
science / through lyuelynes and perspicuite of his wit. The.xj. is / he is
not lyghtlye angry: and this comes through moystnes abatynge the fervor of
coler provoking to anger. The last.ij. verses recite some of the forsayde
tokens / and also some other. First / a sanguine person is free / not
covetous but liberal. Secondly he is amorous. Thyrdly / he has a merry
countenance. Fourthly / he is most part smiling: of which all the benignite
of the blood is cause and prouoker. Fyftlye / he has a ruddye color. For
Auicen says / that ruddy color of the skin / signifies abundance of
blood: And this must be understand of brighte ruddy color and not dark:
such as is wont to be in their facis that drink strong wynes abundantlye /
and that use sauces and sharp spices: for such color signifies lepre to
come. Syxtly / he gladlye singethe and herethe syng^ge / by reason of his merry
mind. Seue^thlye / he is fleshye / through the cause before said. The.viij.
is / he is hardy / through the hete of the blood / which is cause of boldness.
The.ix. is / the sanguine person is benign and gentyl / through the bounte of
the sanguine humor.

Est humor colere / qui competit impetuosis.
Hoc genus est hominum / cupiens precellere cunctos.
Hi leuiter discunt multum comedunt / cito crescunt.
Inde magnanimi / sunt largi summa petentes.
Hirsutus / fallax / irascens / prodigus / audax.
Astutus / gracilis siccus / groceique coloris.
Here the auctour teaches us to know a person of colerike complexion. First
/ he is hasty / by reason of superfluous heat / that mouethe him to hastynes.
Auice^.ii.i. doct. iii. cap. iii.
And therefore Auicen says / that deeds of excessive motion / signify heat.
Secondly / the colerike person is desirous of honor / and coueteth to be
vppermoste / and to excelle all other: by reason that superfluous heat makes
ma^s mind prone to arroga^ce and fool hardynes. Thyrdly / they learn lyghtlye
/ by reason of the subtilnes of the colerike humor. And therefore Auicen says
/ that the understanding / promptnes and quick agilite to intelligence /
betokenethe heat of complexion. Fourthlye they eat much: for in them the
heat digestive is stronger / and more resolutiue than in other bodies. Fyftly
/ they encresse soon / through strength of natural heat in them / which is
cause of augmentation. The.vj. is / they be stout stomaked / that is they can
suffer no injuries / by reason of the heat in them. And therefore Auicen says
secunda.i. doctrina.iii. cap. tertio: that to take every thing impa^iently /
signifies heat. The.vij. is / they be liberal to those that honor them.
The.viij. is / they desire high dignites / and officis. The.ix. is / a
colerike person is hearye / by heat opening the pores / and mouyng the
mattier of hears to the skin. And therefore hit is a common saying / the
colerike man is as heary as a got. The.x. is / he is disceyuable. The.xj. is
/ he is soon angry / through his hot nature. And therefore Auicen says: often
angry / and for a smal^ cause / betoketh heat / through easy motion of coler
and boylynge of the blood about the heart. The.xij. is / he is a waster / in
spendyng largely to obtain honors. The.xiij. is / he is bold: for boldness
comes of great heat specially about the heart. The.xiiij. is / he is wylye.
The.xv. is / he is skle^der membred / and not fleshie. The.xvj. is / he is
lean and dry. The.xvij. is / he is saff^on colored. And therefore Auicen
says: that coler signifiethe dominion.

Restat et adhuc tristis colere substancie nigre.
Qui reddit prauos / per tristes pa^a loquentes.
Hi vigilant studiis / nec men's est dedita somno.
Servant propositum sibi / nit reputant fore tutunt.
Inuidus et tristis / cupidus / dextreque tenacis.
Non ex per^ fraudis / timidus luteique coloris.
Here he declares some tokens of a melancoly person. First / mela^coly makes
folks shrewde and ill manered: as they that kill them self. The.ij. is great
heuines: for melancolye folks are most part sad / through their melancoly
spiritis / troublous and dark: like as clear spiritis make folks glad.
The.iij. is / they talk little / by reason of their coldness. The.iiij. is /
they be studious / for they covet always to be alone. The.v. is / they are no
slepers / nor sleep not well / by reason of the over much drines of the
brain: and through melancoly fumes / they have horrible dreams / yt wake them
out of their sleep. The.vj. is / they be steadfast in their purpose / and of
good memory / and hard to please: and this comethe through their drines.
The.vij. is / they think nothing sure / they always dread / through darkness
of their spiritis. In the.ij. last verses he recitethe some of ye forsayde
signs and other. First / the melancolye person is envious. The.ij. he is
sad. The.iij. he is covetous. Fourthly / he holds fast / and is an ill
payer. Fyftly he is simple / and yet disceitfull: and therefore melancoly folks
are devout / great reders / fasters / and kepers of abstinence. Syxtlye / he
is fearful. Seventhly / he has an earth ye brown color: which color if hit
be any thing grene / signifiethe the dominion of melancolye / as Rasis
says.ij. Alman.

Hi sunt humores / qui prestat cuique colores.
Omnibus in rebus / ex flegmate fit color albus.
Sanguine fit rubeus / colera / ^ubea qu^que ruffus.
Si peccet sanguis / facies ^ubet / extat acellus.
Inflantur gene / corpus nimiumque grauatur.
Est plusquam frequens plenus / mollis / dolor ingens
Maxim fit stontis / et constipatio ventris.
B^caque lingua sitis / et somnia plena rubo^.
Dustior adest sp^ti / sunt act^a duicta queque.
Here the auctour puttethe ye colors that follow the complexions. A flematike
person is whitely colored: the colerike is brown and tawnye: the sanguine is
ruddy: the melancoly is pale / colered like earth. Afterward the text
declares.xij. colors / signifienge superfluite of blood. The first is when
the face is read / by ascendyng of blood / to the heed and face. The second is
/ when the eyes bolle out farther than they were wont. The.iij. is / when the
eyes are swollen. The.iiij. is / when the body is all heuye: for nature can
not sustain nor govern so great qua^tite of blood. The.v. is / when the pulce
beats thycke. The.vj. is / wha^ the pulce is full by reason of the multitude
of hot and moist vapors. The.vij. is / when the pulce is soft / through to
much humidite / mollifienge the mattier. The.viij. is ache of the forheed. The
ix. is wha^ the bealy is costife / through great hete that dries up the
fylthy mattier. The.x. is wha^ the tongue is dry and rough for like cause.
The.xj. is great thyrste / through drines of the stomakes mouth engendered of
great hete. The.xij. is when one dreameth of read things. Auice^.ii.i. doct.
iii. cap. vii.
This Auicen affirms saying / Sleep that signifies abundance of blood / is
when a man dreameth he sees read things: orels yt he shedeth much of his
blood* orels / that he swymmeth in blood and such like. The.xiij. is / the
swetenes of spyttell / through swetenes of blood. Here is to be noted / that
like as there be tokens of abundance of blood / so there be signs of the
abundance of other humors / as in these verses following:

Accusat coleram dextre dolor asper alingua.
Tinnitus / vomitusque frequens / vigilantia multa.
Multasitis / pingr^s / egestio / torsioventris.
Naul^ a fit morsus cordis / languescit ore^is.
Pulsus (...) est grocilis / d^us / velo^que calescens.
Aret / amarescit / incendi asomni^ fingit.
The tokens of abundance of fleme are contained in these verses following.

Flegma supergrediens proprias in corpore leges.
Os facit incipidum / fastidia cerebra / ^il^as.
Costarum stomachi / simul occipitisque dolores.
Pulsus adestrarus / ettardus / mol^s / inanis.
Precedit fallax / fantas^ata / somnus aquosa.
The signs of abundance of melancoly are contained in these verses following.

Humorum pleno dum fex in corpore regnat.
Nigra cutis / durus / pulsus / tenuis et ^rina.
Solicitudo timor / et tristicia / somnia tempus.
Accrescet rugitus sapor / et sputaminis idem.
Leu^que precipue tinnit et sibilat auris.
Denus septenus vix fleubothomia^ petil annus.
Spiritus vbe^ior erit per fleubothomiam.
Spiritus ex potu vini mox multiplicatur.
Humorumque cibo damnum lent reparatur.
Lumina clarificat / sincerat fleubothomia.
Mentes / et cerebrum / calidas facit esse medullas.
Viscera purgabit / stomachum / ventremque ^oerce^.
Puros dat sensus / dat somnum / tedia tollit.
Auditus / vocem / vires producit et auget.
Here thauctour speaks of blood letting. First he shows what age is
required to be blood lette^ / saying: At.xvij. year of age one may be let
blood: And touching this Galen says: Gale^.xl. ^e iugenio
that children should not be let blood / oneles they be.xiiij. year old at
lest: because children bodies be sone resolved from outward heat: and
therefore by voydynge of blood they should be greatly weaked. Also for that
they need to nouryshe their bodies and augment them / they should not diminishe
their blud. And eke for that they be soon dissolved from outward heat / hit
suffiseth / wherefore they need not to be let blood. And wittethe well / that as
blood lettynge is not convenient for children / so it is unwholesome for old
folks / as Galen says: Gal. lx. tegni.
For the good blood is littell and the ill much: and blood lettyng draws
away the good blood / and leaves the ill / as Auicen says: and therefore
blood lettynge is vnco^uenient for such persons. Aui. iiii.i. cap. x.
Seco^dlye / he puttethe the hurt of blood lettynge. Of necessite with
voidynge of blood / done by bloudde lettynge / man's spiritis being in the
blood / do grealye avoid. Thyrdlye / he shows how the spiritis should be
cherished and restored: and that is by drinking of wine after the blood
lettyng: For of all thing to norishe quickly / wine is best as is before
said. The spiritis also be cheryshed and restored by meatis / but that is not
so quickly as by wine. And the meat after blood lettynge / must be light of
digestion / and a great engendrer of blood / as rere eggs / and such like.
And all though meat restore the spiritis after blood lettynge / yet let ye
pacientes beware of much meat the first and.ij. day. For Isaac says in
dietis: that they must drink more than eat: and yet they must drink less
than they did before blood lettynge: for digestion is weaker. Fourthlye / the
auctour puts.xj. conueniences of blood letty^ge duly done. First /
temperate blood lettynge comfort the syghte: for diminishynge of humors
does eke diminishe fumynge to the heed / and the repletion thereof / darkynge
the sight. Secondelye / hit clerethe and makes pure the mind and brain /
through the same cause. Thyrdly / it heateth the mary: for it minishethe the
superfluites / that thereto come and cole it. Fourthly / it purges the
entrayles: for nature vncharged of blood / digesteth better raw humors that
be left. Fyftly / blood lettynge restreyneth vometyng and the laske: for hit
diuerteth the humors from the interior partis to the outward: and specially
letty^ge blood of the arms / as Auicen says: For lettyng blood of the feet
stops not so well: yet perchance the blood lettynge shall augmente the laske
/ and that.ij. ways. First / by blood lettynge nature is discharged of her
burden: and tha^ comforted / hit provoke other vacuations. Secondly / if the
laske be caused by great weakness of virtue contentiue: For than / for that by
blood lettynge virtue is weaked / the laske is augmented. The.vj. is that blud
lettyng clereth the wyttis: For it minisheth vaporation that gothe to the heed
and troublethe the wyttis. The.vij. is hit helpethe one to sleep / for thereby
many humors be voyded / by which sharp vapors and diverse are lyfted up /
lettynge one to sleep. The.viij. is / hit takethe away tediousnes and over
great grefe: for thereby virtue is vnlode^ of grefe: and eke with the blood
mela^coly / the dregs of blood / which induces tediousnes and grefe / is
drawn out. The.ix. is / hit comforts the herynge: for thereby the vapors and
humors ascendinge to the heed / and letty^ge the herynge / are diminished.
The.x. is / hit comfort the voice: for thereby the superfluites and humidites
/ that may come to the breaste or pype of the lyghtis / and let the voice / are
diminished. The.xj. is / hit augmentethe the strengthes: for thereby the body is
unladen of hit grefe / wherefore virtue is augmented.

Tres insunt istis Maius / september / aprilis.
Et sunt lunares / sunt velut ydra dies.
Prima dies primi / postremaque posteriorum.
Nec sanguis minui / nec carnibus anseris vti.
In seen vel iuuene / si vene sanguine plene.
Omni mense been / confert incisio vene.
Hi sunt tres menses / Maius / september / aprilis.
In quibus eminuas / vt longo tempore viuas.
Here thauctour says / that these.iij. May / september / and aprile / are the
months of the moon: and in them are days forbidden to let blood / that is
the first of May / and last of september and aprile. Though this be a
common rule / yet hit is false. For the forsayde days may be as good and
worthy to be chose^ as the other / after the diversity of constellation in
them. Farther / the auctour says / yt in those days none should eat goose
flesh: which also is false and erroneous / and very witchecraft. I think
thauctour had this saying of the jews / which observe such manner. Secondly
he says / yt men of myddell age and young folks / whose veins be full of
blood / may be let blood every month: for those may well resist resolution:
and in them is great qua^tite of good blood. Thyrdly he says: that blud
lettyng for man's health / must be done in one of these.iij. months / may /
september / and aprile. but yet with difference. for in aprile and may the
liver vein must be let blood / because than in vere time the blood
increases: and in september in the spleen vein / because of melancoly /
which than in autumpne increases.

Frigida natura frigens / regio / dolor ingens.
Post lauachrum / coitum / minor etas / atque seniles.
Morb^s prolixus / repletio potus et esce.
Si fragi^is vel subtilis sensus stomachi sit.
Et fastiditi tibi sunt fleubothomandi.
Here thauctor puts.xij. things that let blud lettyng. The first is coldness
of complexion. for as Galen says: blood lettyng cools and augmenteth
coldness: because / as Isaac says / blood is the fou^dacion of natural hete:
and in that blood lettyng voydeth blood / hit voydeth hete / and so
consequently cools. The.ij. is a fervent cold country / under which a cold
season should be co^prehe^ded / which also lets blood lettyng: for in a
country and season very cold / the blud is closed in the depest partis of the
body: and the blood that taryeth in the utter partis / the cold makes thycke
/ which to void is no wisdom. The.iij. is fervent ache: under which eke
may be comprehended great infla^mation of the body: for if one in such
accide^tis be let blood / there follows motion agitatiue / contrary to nature
/ and greatter infla^mation / which weaketh nature more. The cause of this
motion agitatiue is attractio^ to diverse partis: for by blood lettyng
attraction is caused to the place yt is let blud: and by great ache /
attractio^ is caused to the place of ache. The cause of greatter infla^macio^
is / yt by blud lettyng ye humors be moved / whereby they be more inflamed. And
this is truth when blud lettyng is little and artificial. Yet if it be done
till one swou^d hit is wholesome in the forsaide cases: for this blood lettyng /
when it ouercometh the attraction of the ache: it causes not motion agitatiue.
and like wise it takes away infla^mation / when there be no humors / that
should move hete / and cause more infla^macion. This is Galens mind / saying:
Gal. in common. illius apho. que egerunt.
there is no better medicine for an i^postume of fervent infla^mation / fevers
/ and a great ache / than blud lettyng. The.iiij. is baynyng / specially
resolutiue: for that lets blood lettyng: for that were vacuatio^ upon
vacuatio^ / which nature can not esily bear. The v. is carnal copulacion:
for i^mediately there after one should not be lette^ blood / because of double
weakyng of nature. The.vi. is to old or to young / as it is before touched. Of
this Auicen says: Take heed how thou let one blood in any of the forsaid
cases: outcept thou trust in the figure / in solidite of the musculs / largenes
of the veins / ye fulness of them / and ruddy color. The.vii. is long
sickness: for by such letty^g of blud / nature is doubly febled / both by the
long sickness and diminishio^. This is of truth says Auicen / outcept there
be corrupt blood / for than blood lettyng is wholesome. The.viij. is great
replecion of drink. The.ix. is to eat to much meat: and under this is
comprised meat undigested. The cause hereof (as Auicen says) is this: there
be.iij. things that draw to them / that is voydnes / hete / and secret
virtue or proprete. Than if the veins be empty through voydyng of blood / they
draw to them from the stomach or liver / undigested or superfluous meat or
drink: which undigested meat common to ye me^bres / can not be amended /
that is / digested: for ye third digestion can not amend the fault of the.ij.
nor the second of the first: if the fault be so great yt hit can not convert
into the me^bres: hit there remayny^g may cause some disease. The.x. is
feebleness. Gal ii. (...).
for blood lettyng is a strong voyder / as Galen says: therefore a feeble
person may not endure great diminishyng of blud. The.xi. is subtle
sensiblenes of the stomakes mouth: which is called the heart string: for of
such blood lettyng swou^^yng follows easily. And under this / weakness of the
stomach is eke comprised / and easy flowynge of coler to ye mouth thereof /
endusyng vometyng. Wherefore they yt have the forsaid accidents should not be
let blood: for by blood lettyng the humors moved be enduced to the stomakes
mouth / as to a place accustomed: and because hit is a weak and an impotent
membre to resist that flixe: therefore by such lettynge of blood many
inconveniences chance. This is one cause why many swou^d / wha^ they be let
blood: by reason the coler flows to ye stomach: which bytynge the stomach /
pyneth ye heart and stomach so / that hit causes one to swou^de. The.xij. is
lothyng: for if in this lothynge one be let blood / when the veins be empty /
they draw to them ill mattier causyng lothesomnes. Auicen touches many of
these.vi. last accidentis. And besides the forsaid accidentis there be other
that let blood lettyng. First voydyng of menstruous flixe or the emeraudes: for
one diseased with either of these should not be let blood: yet it may be done
to divert the flixe or matter. The.ii. is rarenes of composition: for in rare
bodies is much dissolucion: and therefore this resolution suffiseth them
without euacuation / as Galen says.ix. teigni. The.iii. is rawnes and
cla^mynes of humors: for than beware of blood lettyng / because it increases
rawenes of humors: and therefore in long sickness ye should not let blood: for
rawnes of humors encreseth / strength febleth / and the sickness prolo^geth.
And therefore Auicen says / that in long sickness before one is let bloub / he
should take a laxatiue / although he need both. Rawnes of humors is caused.ii.
ways. One is through abundance of humors chokyng natural hete: which
chokynge bredeth raw humors / and than blood lettynge is wholesome. Wherefore
Alexander says: Lettyng of blood in ye beginning of the dropsy is wholesome:
Alex. ii.ii. ca. de hydroppist.
when it comes by abundance of me^struous blud / that through some cause is
prohibited to issue: or by abundance of the emeraudis: For like as a lyttel
fire is quenched under a great heap of wodde: like wise natural hete is
suffocate with abundance of humors. The.ij. cause of raw humors / is feebleness
of natural hete / as in folks of feeble complexion / or that have been long
sick / or be very aged: for than ye said blud lettyng is unwholesome: because
hit augmenteth rawenes: for the blud that observes hete / is drawn out / and
so the body is made cold and the humors more raw: Therefore the blood must be
left to digest these raw humors. The.iiij. is undue disposicion of the air /
either to hot or to cold: for much hete causethe strong resolucion: and
great cold makes ye blud thick and unapt to issue or avoid.

v. things in blood lettyng.
This text declares.v. things that ought to be done about blood lettyng: some
before / some at the time / and some after. The first is anoyntyng / which
other while is used in the blood lettyng / as to anoynte the place or vein yt
is opened: to aswage the pain: sometime hit is used after blud lettyng to keep
the gashe that it close not up to soon / that the humors left in the veins
may have some respiracion / and some ill fumes void out. The.ij. is to dry^ke /
and specially wine / which is good in blud lettyng / if one hap to swou^de:
and also hit is very wholesome after blud lettyng / to revive the spirits and
engendre new blud / which thing in practyse all physicians observe. The.iij.
is baynyng / which is wholesome.iij. days before and.iij. days after blud
lettyng / and not the same day. Hit is good before / if one think he have
gross humors within him: for baynyng leuseth and moves humors: and for the
said cause / hit is wholesome to take a sharp syrope before / to move / dissolve
/ and make subtle the humors. And therefore / when ye will let one blud / ye
must rub the arm / that the humors in the veins about may be made subtle
and prepared to issue out more esily. Hit is holsom after blud lettynge / that
the residue of humors and vapors left behynd / may be leused. Hit is not
wholesome the same day / for baynyng makes ye skyn lynnowe / which made lynnowe
/ will not abide ye stroke given in blud lettyng / and that is dangerous.
The.iiij. is byndynge with lynnen clothes / which is very wholesome to stop the
blud after euacuation thereof: and before bledyng / to draw the humors to the
veins / and to cause them to swel / and better to appear. The.v. is moderate
walkyng before blud lettyng to dissolve and make subtle the humors: afterward
to leuse the residue of the humors left behind. Here note / that some use to
be let blud fasting: but some other say / hit were better to eat a rererosted
egg first / and thereto drink a draught of wine / about the hour of.ix. or.x.
before dinner / and forth with to be let blud. The cause is / wha^ ye stomach is
empty / nature reteyneth still ye blud more strongly / lest she should lack
norishement: but when one has eat a lyttel norishyng meat / as wine and
eggs is / than nature suffers ye blud better to issue.

Exhi^ara^ tristes. iratos placat amantes.
Ne sint amentes fleubothomia facit.
^
Here be declared.iii. effectis of blud lettyng. First it makes a sad person
merry. Secondly it appeseth angry folks. The reason is this: much mela^coly
myngled with the blud / causes heaviness / and much coler causes a^ger:
which.ij. humors / as they be myngled with the blud / are drawn out by blud
lettyng. Thirdly hit keeps lovers from furious rauyng / for it remoueth the
blud from ye heed auoydyng it by the other exterior partis. Farther note / that
there be.v. causes of blud lettyng. The first is / that the abundance / whether
it be in qualite / or quantite / or both / should be voyded. For as Auicen
says / two manner folks must be let blud. One is they that be disposed to be
sick / that have abundance of blud in quantite. The other is they yt are sick
already / through the malice of humors or blud. But there is difference in
these.ii. blud lettynges. For blud lettyng for the abundance of blud ought to
be much: but wha^ it is done to avoid ill blud / it must be moderate / as
Galen says.ix. metategni. And therefore they do very ill yt let them self
blede till they perceive the good blud issue / for perauenture all their blud
shall ru^ne out / er they se any good blud appear. Therefore they should void a
lyttel at ones: and after the mind of Galen / in this case: before they let
one blud / they should give him good meats / to enge^der good blud / to fulfill
the place of the ill blud avoided: and after within a little space / to let him
blud a lyttel and a lyttel. This is called direct letty^g of blud: for it is
done to avoid abundance of blud / and of such humors as should be avoided.
The first indirecte cause is the greatness of ye disease / and greatness of the
apparent vehement infla^macion: for as Gale^ says / there is no better medicine
for an i^postume of vehement infla^macion / fevers / and great ache / Gal. in
common. illiu^ apho. qu^ egerunt.
tha^ blud lettyng. The.ii. indirect cause is / that the mattier which must be
avoided / be drawn to y^ place from whens it must be avoided. And therefore in
retencion of ye menstruous flixe and emeraudis / the great vein in the ^ote
called sophena / must be opend / as Galen says / to draw down the mattier of
ye blud. The.iij. indirect cause is / to draw ye humors to the place contrary
to that place that they flow to / to divert the mattier from yt place. Therefore
/ for to much abundance of me^struosite / the vein basilica must be let blud
/ to turn the mattier to ye contrary part / and so to void hit from hit
propre course. And therefore he yt has a pluresie on his lift side / must be
let blud on the right side / to divert and draw the mattier to the place
contrary to yt place that it inclines to. And like wise if it be on ye right
side / to let blud on the lift. The.iiij. indirect cause is / that by lettyng
of blud one portion of the mattier may be avoided / that nature may be the
stronger upon ye residue: and so lettyng of blud is wholesome / when ye body is
full / lest impostumes grow: for ye regiment of nature is feeble / i^ regard of
these humors: wherefore a portion of ye mattier is voyded / lest through
unableness of nature in gouernyng the mattier / ye mattier should flow to some
weak place and bread an impostume.

Fa^ plagam largam mediocriter. vt cito fumus
Ex^at vberius / liberiusque cruo^.
Here thauctor says / yt the gashe made in lettyng o^ blud / ought to be of a
mean largenes / that the same and gross blud may esily issue out: for when ye
gashe is strait / the pure blud only goth out / and the gross abith still in.
And note / yt sometime the gashe must be great and sometime small. The gashe must
be great for.iii. causes. First / because the humors be gross / and gross
blud must be voyded: as in them yt be mela^coly. Secondly / in winter ye gashe
must be great / for cold engrosseth the humors. Thyrdly / for thabu^da^ce of
humors / for they avoid better by a great gashe than a small. But the gashe
must be small / when the person is of weak strength / that the spiritis and
natural hete avoid not to much: and like wise in a hot season / and when
the blud is pure.

Sanguine subtracto sex horis est vigilandum.
Ne somni fumus ledat sensibile corpus.
Ne neruum ledat non sit tibi plaga profunda.
Sanguine purgatus non carpas protinus escas.
Three things must be consydred wha^ one is let blud. First / yt he sleep not
within.vi. hours after ^est ye fumes engendered by sleep asce^de to the heed
and hurt ye brain. There be other causes. First / lest he in sleep turn him
on the arm that is let blud and thereby hurt him. The.ii. is / lest ye humors
by sleep flow to ye peynful member / by reason of the incision / and so bread
an impostume. For Gale^ says / that if impostumes bread in ye body / or in a
member hurt: the humors flow thereunto. But Auicen assigns an other cause /
that by such sleep may chance co^fraction of the me^bres: The cause may be as
Galen says / that sleep is unwholesome in the ague fyt: for natural hete goth
inward / Gal. ii. apho. super illo. In quo etc.
and ye out ward pertis wax cold / and ye fumes remain unconsumed: whereby
the rigor is augmented / and ye fever fyt prolonged. Also by mouyng of ye
humors i^ letty^g of blud / fumes are reised up to ye senowes and braunes of
ye arms: which remaynyng unconsumed / wax cold in sleep / and ingrosse in
the utter parts. And therefore if one sleep i^mediately after lettyng of blud /
they cause confraction of the senowes and braunes of tharmes. Secondly / he
says / that one in lettyng blud must beware / yt he make not ye gashe to deep
/ lest he hurt a senowe or an artery string under ye vein: for hurtyng of a
senowe causes a mortal crampe / or loss of a member / as an arm or a finger:
and hurt of an arteri string / causes bledyng incurable. The.iiij. is / one
ought not to eat i^mediatly aft he is let blud / but he must tarry till ye
humors in him be in qete / lest ye meat er hit be digested be drawn together
with the blud / to succor the hurt membre.

Omnia de lacte vitabis rite minute.
Et vitet potum fleubothomatus homo.
Frigida vitabit. quia sunt inimica minutis.
Interdictus erit minutis nubilus aer.
Spiritus exultat minutis luce per auras.
(...) subtle / and to ru^ne through out all the body / outcept the matter be
furious. The.ii. is abundance of the matt^er: for Gale^ says on ye aphorism:
Inchoantilus morbis. etc. yt it is than behoueful to be let blud / or take a
medicine laxatiue / to alleuiate nature loded with abundance of mattier.
The.iii. is greatness and sharpenes of the sickness / as when there is a great
and an acheful impostume / though the mattier be lyttel. Gal. xiii. (...)
For Gale^ says: if the impostume be great / ye must let blud at the beginning
though there be but lyttel mattier: lest it break or open er it be ripe:
therefore to eschew many inco^uenie^ces blud lettyng must be done. (...) is so
(...) either to (...) or death (...)
The.ii. rule is / yt blud letty^g may not be done on the day of mocio^ of the
sickness as in crisis) nor no other vacuacion nor diuertyng of mattier from the
place that nature sends it to. Nor like wise in the ague fyt. For Galen
says.i. aph. that wha^ the sickness is in hit estate neither blud lettyng nor
laxatiue should be done: for than the matter rypeth / which rypeth better by
quietness tha^ ^rryng. The.iii. rule is / yt lettyng of blud should not be done
in begy^nyng of the sickness / when crisis is removed: for Isaac says in his
book of vrins / that though the heart be the enge^drer of the blud and spiritis
/ yet the blud is fundacio^ of natural hete / and susteyneth hit: for hete is
naturally thereof engendered: and therefore one voydyng blud voydeth hete: which
should digest the mattier of the sickness: and so consequently the sickness is
prolo^ged / and strength weaked. And therefore hit is to dread / lest through
lengthynge of the sickness / and weakyng of ye stre^gthe / nature should fail.
The.iiii. rule is / that ye body having dregs or filth i^ the guttis / should
not be let blud. The cause is: there be.iii. things yt draw to them / hete
emptynes / and all the shap: now the veins e^pted by lettyng of blud / dawe
to them from the next me^bres / as the guttis and stomach / whereby yt bealy is
indurated / and the mattier in the veins more infected: the miseraike draws
the humidites of the ordeurs / and the ordeurs are dried the more: therefore ye
must first mollify the bealy with clisters or suppositories / except it wax
laxatiue alone. The.v. rule is / That lettyng of blud should not be much used:
for by often vsyng thereof / one waxyng old / falls in to diverse diseases / as
epilencie / apoplexy / and palsy: for by remouyng of ye blud and hete / many
flematike superfluites are engendered / that cause these diseases. The.vi. rule
is / that a woman me^struate / or with child should not be let blud. A woman
with child should not / for thereby the hete that digesteth meat is dimin^ and
the food of yt that she goth with / taken away: specially when it that she
goth with waxes great / for tha^ it needs more food. This says
Hippocrates.v. aph. wha^ the menstruosite keeps due curse and voydeth
naturally enough / letty^g of blud should not be done / but when it voydeth to
much / than to divert the mattier it must be done: for nature would not be let
of her operacion. The.vii. rule is / that after the colerike passion one should
not be let blud: for by reason that lettyng of blud sturreth up the humors / a
colerike on the right side of the body stands ye member that engenders blud
/ that is the liver: and the receptacle of coler / the galle. Autu^ne
enge^dreth melancoly / which is gethered to gether / and not resolved by
wenter: therefore in ver^ and winter / those veins should be let blud / in
which mela^coly has dominion / which be the lift side veins: for ye splen
is on the lift side of the body / which is the receptacle of mela^coly.
Secondly he says yt these.iiii. me^bres / the heed / the heart / the foot / and
the liver after the.iiii. seasons of the year / must be empted: the heart in
ver^ / the liver in somer / the heed i^ winter / and the foot in autumn.

Dat saluatella tibi plurima dona minuta.
Purgat epar / splenem / pectus / precordia / vocem.
Innaturalem tollit de cord dolorem.
Here he touches.vi. co^modites that come by lettyng blud of the vey^e called
saluatella. hit is the vein on the back of ye hand / between ye myddyll
finger and ring finger. First / it purges ye liver / Secondly it cle^set^
^ene. Thyrdly it mu^difieth the breast. Fourthly hit preserves the stomakes
mouth from hurt. Fyftly hit does away hurt of ye voice. Sixthly / hit does away
unnatural ache of the heart. The reason of all these co^modites is / because
the foresaid vein auoydeth blud from al these places / as after it shall
appear. For a more ample declaracion hit is to wit / that in lettyng of blud
/ other while the veins be opend / and sometime ye arteries. The openy^g of the
artery is dangerous: the chief cause hereof is the ouermoche bledyng: which
is caused.ii. ways. One is through fervent hete of the artery blud. for a
hot thing is soon mouable / and delateth and opens ye artery: and
therefore hit helps much / to void ye blud in lettyng blud the artery.
The.ii. cause is mobilite of ye artery: and therefore the wound or gashe in it
is slowlier healed: for wou^des without rest can not heal. Yet this letty^g of
blud is wholesome.iii. manner wise. First / when there is abu^da^ce of subtle
blud i^ the body. Secondly when ye blud is vaporous. Thirdly when it is hot.
For subtle blud / of which natural blud and spiritis be engendered / rests
in the artery: but gross blud that norisheth the me^bres / rests in the
veins. Like wise vaporous blud is contained in the artery / and sanguine blud
in the veins. Also the hottest blud / which of the heart the hottest member
is engendered and digested / is contained in ye artery / and the other b^d i^
the veins. Secondly note / ye veins are opend in many me^bres / sometime in ye
arm / or in the great hand or small / sometime i^ the foot / somtym^ (...)
nose / in the forheed / in the lyppes / sometime under the tongue or i^ the ruff
of the mouth / sometime in the corners of the eyes toward the forheed. From the
arm pyt to the elbowe are.v. veins to be opend / as Rasis and Auicen say: One
is called cephalica / which is the heed vein: the.ii. is called basilica /
which is the liver vein. The.iii. is mediana or cardiana or nigra after
Auicen / or matrix after Rasis. The.iiii. is assellaris. The.v. is funis
brachii. In the less hand is saluatella: so that in the arm / in that it
co^teyneth the more and less hand / are.vi. veins to be ope^d. Cephalica
empteth the partis above the neck: and therefore to open hit is good for
diseasis of ye heed / ye megrym and other hot grefes / or caused of hot
mattier. This vein begins at the shulder / and goth forth toward the lift
side of the arm. Basilica empteth the parts under the neck / as from ye
breaste and liver: and therefore lettyng blud of this vein is wholesome for
diseases of the breast and liver / and right good in a pluresy. This vein
begins at the arm hole / and goth alo^ge to the bowyng of the arm. Mediana
is between these.ii. said veins / and is co^pact of them both: for it is ye
bra^che of each. And it is eke median in vacuation: for it voydeth from al
about / under / from / and above ye neck. Wherefore it is the universal vein
to all the body in voydyng: not universal (as some say) because it begins
at ye (...)* but because it is ye bra^che of cephalica and basilica. Therefore
if ye would let cephalica blud / and it appears not: ye should rather take
mediana tha^ ^ica. And like wise if ye would let basilica blud / and it appears
not / ye should rather minishe mediana than cephalica: for it agrees better to
both / than one of them with the other. Saluatella is the vein between ye
myddell and ring finger / more declynyng to ye myddell finger. Hit begins
of basilica. This vein is opend in the right hand for opilacion of the liver
/ and in ye lift hand for opilacio^ of the spleen. There is no reason why it
should be so as Auicen says / but experience: which Galen found by a dream
as he says: He had one in cure / whose liver and spleen were stopte / and he
dreamed to let him blud of this vein / and so he did / and cured the pacient.
This vein is let blud / puttyng ye hand in warm water / to engros and dilate
it / because it is subtle: and yt the gashe should not close to soon / and to
make ye gross blud thynne. Assellaris is under basilica / and appears i^
byndyng the arm: and like judgment is of it as of basilica. Funis brachii is
over cephalica / orels the hyndermost bone: and is of one judgment with
cephalica. Therefore as Auice^ and Galen say / though in openyng of veins / be
universal vacuacion of all the body: yet not from al veins egally: nor like
ieoperdy is not in all. For Rasis says cephalica is ye surer / and basilica
more to be feared: and cardiaca is to fear / but not so much as basilica.
Cephalica is surest: for there is neither senow (...) above nor dnder hit: but
under cardiaca is a ^owe: and upper above it is a subtle senowe: therefore hit
is to fear lest it should be cut. Basilica is (...) ieoperdous: for under it
is an artery / and nere (...) ^now and a muscul. Saluatella is not ieoperdous:
and therefore ye bett to open it / it would be put in warm water. In ye foot
be.iii. veins / sciatica / sophena / and the ha^me vein. These be opend when
we woll draw the blud to ye lower pertis / as in prouokyng me^struosite: and
the ha^me vein is better than sophena or sciatica / for it is nerer the
matrice. Sophena draws blud from ye yard / coddis / and matrice: and sciatica
from the ancles raynes / and other me^bres toward man's lift side. sophena from
the matrice and me^bres there about / tho they be branches of one vein. In the
myddis of the forheed is a vein / which is opend for old diseasis of the face
/ as morpheu / dry scurfe and scabbe. and for disesis of the eyes: but first
cephalica must be minished. There is like wise a vein in the nose / and in
openyng of each the neck must be bound / and one opend after an other: and by
byndyng the neck they will better appear. There be veins in the lips which
be opend for i^postumes i^ the mouth or go^mes: but cephalica is first
minished. The.4. veins i^ the ruff of the mouth ope^d / avail against reumes
flowyng to the tethe / and causyng them to ache. These veins apere plainly /
and must be ope^d wha^ the mattier is digested. There be veins i^ the corners
of the eyes / toward the forhed / and they be ope^d for disesis of the eyes /
cephalica first minished. Also there be veins under ^he tongue / which are let
blud for the swynal^ ^ephalica first minished. The veins in the timpu^s be let
blud for the megrym and for great and (...) heed ache. And those be the veins
/ yt Hippo^ and Galen call iuueniles: the incision of which makes a man
unable to get children. Also i^ the neck be veins / called guides: which
must be opend in the beginning of lepre: and specially for stoppyng of the wynd
pipes / and in the swynacy / which lets one to draw his breath.

Here thauctor notes.ii. things. First / A medicine for the heedach caused by
dri^kyng
if heedache come by to much dry^kyng specially of wine / or of any other
dry^ke / yt makes folks dronke: one must drink cold wat upon it: which with
it coldness ingrosseth the fumes lifted up / and lets them to hurt the
brain. The.ii. is / that if the top of the heed or forheed be grieved with to
much hete: than the tympuls should be moderately chafed / and after washed
with warm water that moderwort is sodde in: for motherworte is cold and
cools.

Here thauctor notes diverse things. First / yt much fasting in summer
dries the body: for in that that somer of hit nature is hot and dry / it
^esolueth the humors: the which also be resolved by often sweaty^g in somer:
and so fasting thervpo^ dries ye body much more: for wha^ the humidite of
meat is gone / ye hete of ye body works on hit own humidites / drieng them
up. Wherefore Hippocrates says: Hunger is expedient for those / yt are very
moist: for hunger dries the body. The.ii. is: that vometyng ones a month is
holsom: for thereby hurtful humors / contained in all the circute of the
stomach are voyded. To this agrees Auice^ / Hip. ^. pert. (...).
saying: Hippocrates byddeth one vomete each month twyse.ii. days one after
an other / that ye ii. day may avoid it that the first day co^ude not: this
conserueth health / scouryng the stomach from fleme and coler. The stomach has
nothy^g to purge it / as the guttis have red coler. Auicen puts other
profits of vometyng well done. First hit is good for heed ache / caused by
moist vaporous mattier ascendyng from the stomach to the heed: but if heed ache
come of hit own hurt of ye brain / tha^ vometyng does (...) hurt tha^
profit. Secondly it clereth the sight ^rke^ by vaporous mattier of the stamake
/ orels not. The.iii. is / hit does away wamblyng cau^ (...) ^make / in
auoydyng the humor that (...). The.iiii. is / hit comfort the stomach / in
to the which coler is descended / ye which corrupts the meat. The.v. is /
hit does away lothyng or aborryng of meat. The.vi. is / hit does away the
cause / that makes one have a lust to sharp / ponticke / and sower things:
the which cause of these disposicions removed / puts away the effect
thereof. The.vii. is / vometynge is wholesome for the laske that comes before the
dropsy: for hit auoydeth the mattier of ye said laske / and purges the
stomach. The.viii. is / hit is wholesome for the grefes in the raynes and
bladder: for the mattier flowynge to these parts / hit diuerteth an other way.
The.ix. is / if vometyng be done by constraynt of elborie / hit auoydeth the
mattier / whereof lepre grows: hit amendeth the first digestion / that the
other digestions may the better be done. The.x. is / hit makes one to have a
good color. The.xi. is / hit purges ye stomach of a humor / that causes
epilencie. The.xii. is / by strong constraynt hit remoueth a stoppynge mattier
/ ye which causes ictericie: And like wise hit auoydeth a flematike mattier /
which commonly is cause of this stoppyng. The.xiii. is / hit auoydeth the
mattier that causes asma: the which is a disese causy^g one to draw his
breath peynfully: and eke hit comfort the spiritall members / by whose hete
/ the superflu^ causynge asma / are consumed. The.xiiii. is / hit (...) ^lsome
against shaking and palsy: for hit auoy^h the mattier that is cause thereof.
The.xv is ^s holsom for one that has great black sore^ his lower parts: for
hit turns the humors away from thence. Al though vometyng duly and well done
be cause of these co^modites: yet when it is unduly done / hit induces many
hurtes: for it febleth the stomach and makes it apt for mattiers to flow
into / hit hurts the breast / the sight / the tethe / old heed ache. etc. as
Auicen says.iiii.i. cap. xiiii. The.iii. thing that is noted in the text is
/ that there be four seasons of the year / ver^ / somer / autumpne / and
winter. Ver^ in respect of other seasons / is hot and moist / though hit be
temperate in it self / as Galen says in his book of complexions: whereof hit
follows / yt this season is more apt to let blud in than the other: for hit
does more encreace humors. And therefore in this season moderate use of carnal
copulacion / te^perate mocio^ / laske / flixe / and swette / is convenient: and
like wise te^perate bathyng to diminishe replecio^. This season is eke good to
take purgacio^s in. The.iiii. is / somer heteth and dries: and therefore hit
increases read coler / hot and dry. And for this cause in somer we must
feed on cold moist meats / to diminishe the feruentnes of hete and drought:
and than we must absteyn ^ from carnal copulacion / which also dries: and
from often bathyng / and be let blud seldom / for like cause. We must use
quietness and little mocion: for (...) ^s does moist / and much mocion dries
(...) ^is season in special we must use moderate ^ (...) drink: for
superfluous drynkyng of cold^ ^nke / by reason that the pores be open / does
man ^e body suddenly a cold / or causethe the palsy / or laxite of the
members / orels sudden death: From the which he defend us / that lives and
reigns eternally. Amen.
