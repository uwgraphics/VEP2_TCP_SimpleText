BIBLIA

Veritas.

Heresia.

Hendrick Laurentz excud. Amstelrodam. 1628.


GReat King protect us with thy gracious hand,
Or else Armenius will over spread this Land:
For if in England the enemy does appear,
This is the shape of him we need to fear.
He raises Factions, and that brings in iarres,
Which broacheth Errors, and vpholds the wars:
The Netherlands ruin, he sought to bring,
In England now he does the self same thing.
To rail, to write, to publish bitter gall,
To change Religi^n, and subvert us all.
His Squint-eyed looks and Lansa-Wolsa gown,
Shows how Religion h^ will soon throw down.
His grynding pate with weather-Cocks turned brain,
Seeks the Churches tenets for to stain:
The Crystal streams of truth he shuns most pure,
The trial of Gods word he will not endure:
But unto Error cast his blinking eye,
Presuming Truth does not the same epsy.
Heresy upon a stately Beast does stand,
Armenius bids him welcome, holds his hand.
Truth by her brightness, and her sincere heart,
Shows that with Heresy she takes no par.
Treades on their Mounteb ink and Cozning tricks,
Blown in his ears, by Pe^agius and Jesuits.
Which makes his Wind-mil for promotions grace
Publish his Books abroad in every place:
And begs protection for his works of wonder,
Which against Truth he bellows forth like thunder.
Thus does Armenius to preferment rise,
By Equiuocating and his Cheuerill lies:
And Truth to all appeals to open view,
Bidding all Heresies for ere adieu
Desiring our great CHARLES to take to heart*
And by the Parliament make Armenius smart.
Which being done England shall ever bless
The King, the State, the Churches happiness,
And if for telling truth, I burn or frye;
What then deserves he that tells a lie? 1628.
