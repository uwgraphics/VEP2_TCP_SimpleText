Wyllyam Hunnis to the reader.
I Have here picked out (most gentle reader) these psalms following which no
late writer has hitherto touched, and yet for the excellency of the matter in
them contained, seemed most worthy this labor and pain. And this enterpryce I
have taken in hand not in tendynge thereby any praises or glory should
redounde unto me but chiefly for this purpose that those, which in psalms and
pleasant songs has delight, might hereof receive some pleasure or profyt.
Read them therefore most gentyl reader with judgment judge with discresion.
And although that in some places they be not so eloquentlye turned as
paraduenture the matter of them requires, yet for the exceeding profit that
does proceed of them, reiecte them not, but accept my good will, which wholye
endeavored my self and go about to satiffye, and to accomplish thy desire to
profyt every man and disprofit in no wise, which thing if I do obtain, I have
that I look for, if not, yet I ought to be pardoned, forasmuch as my good will
to please and profyt failed not, but power only lacked. Hereafter god willing
other things shall be taken in hand of me, both more wyllynglye and also
finished more exactlye, if I do perceive these the first fruits of my labors
and pains to be acceptid and taken in good worth Fare well.

But set thou up thy self o god

So that the wicked men in earth
may quyte be overthrown
They lie in wait, and have laid forth
a net to take me in
A pytte allo they made for me
But they be caught therein.

HOw good it is to praise the lord
no tongue can it express
A joyful and a pleasant thing
the lords praise is doutles
The lord does build Jerusalem
So that it shall remain
And the outcastes of Israel

The lord does heal, the contrytt heart
and medecyne does him give
And in his sycknes, thus says he,
thou shall not dye, but live
The sterrys also he does number
and callyth them by name,
And every one in order due,
does ansuer to the same
Great is our god, and eke his power
his wisdom has no end,
He settyth up the meke in heart,
the wyckyde do contend,
O sing unto the lord our god,
a song of thanckfulnes
Sing praise upon the ^unyd ha^^
his goodness to express
For he does hyde ye heuens with clouds
that no man may it se
And does prepare the rain for earth
to water the plant and tree.
And on the hills that be so hye
he makes grass to grow
And al is for the use of man
such kyndenes he does show
And eyke the bestes, that be in feilde
he helps, them at need
And the young rauyns, that call on him
he does them al ways feed
As in the strength of horsys great
the lord has no delyght
Nor neither in the legs of men
that be so full of might
The lords delyght, is in those men,
that fear, and do him serve,
And they which put their trust in him,
for mercy shall not sterue
Jerusalem, Jerusalem
praise thou the lord above,
And thou Syon do not forget
his mercy and his love.
For he has fortified thy gates
With bars that be right sue^
And he in the has blessed thy sede
for ever to endure.
And in thy borders, he has set
peace in every place,
With grain and corn he has the filled
of him thou found such grace.
He sends forth his holy word
the world to run about,
That every man might know his power
and therein have no dout
He gives snow whyter then woll
as we oftene do se.
And skateteth the hory frostes
list ashes made of tree.
He casts forth his yse abroad
Whose cold no man may bide
Again his word sone does them melte
throughout the world so wide
To Jacob then the lord did show
his word both pure and right
And Israel his ordinance
to keep both day and night
He has not dealt with any land
such kyndnes for to show
Neither his words nor yet his laws
the hethen does not know.
Praise we the father. etc.

THe lord our god of Israel
Be blessed now therefore

Even since the world begone
Whose sayings true shall still remain
until the world be done.
That we should thus be saved than
from all our enemies hands
And from those gyantes crueltye
that would us tie with bands.

Of promys that is sweet
And eke the oath, perform will he
which long before was sworn
Unto our father Abraham
before that we were borne
That we being delivered
out of the wicked hand
Might serve the lord in love and fear
as well by sea as land.
In holiness and rightousnes

For thou shall go before the lord

Might se to guide their feet in peace

A THANKESGEVINGE TO god for delyuerynge from adversity. Ecclesiastus the
last.
I Thank the lord and god my king
And praise the Christ my savior
Early and late whiles I here live
Always to exalte thine honor.
I will yield praise unto thy name
For thou have been my buckeler
Against those men that sought my life
Thou art my aid and soccoure
And have preserved my body
Iro^ them that thought to destroy it
With their false and traiterous tongues
Yet could they nothing anoye it
Thou gave me the vpperhande
Of them that rose up against me
So that my foes could find no cause
Of right to triumph over me.
When I was compassed round about
And no man by that could help me
I looked back but none was there
that then might help or succor me
Then lord thought I upon thine acts
And had in mind thy great mercy
Namely of old how thou do them
Preserve that put their trust in the
Thus lift I up my prayer then
and prayed for delyueraunce
Thou lord dyddest hear me by and by
Whereof I had perseueraunce,
Therefore will I acknowledge the
So long as life does in me bide
I will not stynt thy name to praise
Throughout the world so wide:
Finis.
The complaynt of a sinner.
ALas wretched sinner that I am
Comfortles and of men forsaken
A sinner into the world I came
From whence I know I shall be taken
yet of my sinful life amendynge
to the I try O Lord sweet Jesus.
Miserere mei deus:
I have offended both heaven and earth
Now whether shall I go or turn me
I have transgressed from my birth
The laws of god and that greuouslye
To whom should I for succor fly
But unto the o lord sweet Jesus
Miserere mei deus.
To heaven I dare not lift up mine eyes
I have so sore sinned against it
Yet lord thy servant do not despise
Which wyllyngly does now repent it
Al sins have thou forgiven and granted
To him in faith that does cry thus
Miserere mei deus.
In earth I find no place of defense
I have been so noisome unto it
Shall I despair in this my offense
Then am i dampened God forbid it
My soul shall cry in the lords presence
Evermore continuallye thus
Miserere mei deus.
Mercy is with god my savior
And he only shall be my refuge
He will not dispice his creatoure
Ne yet forsake his own image
But gives increase of knowledge
To him that in faith does still cry thus
Miserere mei deus.
