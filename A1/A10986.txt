THE PROLOGVE.
EN into Courts is Curiosity,
Manheid, manners; nurtour and co^^tasie,
Gif in the heid greit vertew dois auan^^
Sa in members I think sicly ke should be.
Curage, kyndnes, gentrice and honesty
To do the heid service and observance,
To God alone also for his plesance
And faileing that, all is bot fantasy,
For warldlie mirth wald have sum temperance.
Sum cummis to court to serve their King and Queen
To conqueis lands sum settis their courage clean,
Greit Lordis and Lairdis the court wald hald in hand
Sum their kynnismen to Court causis conuene.
Sum for to se, and vthers to be seen.
With braid Buklars brawling with birneist brand
Sum their gat fais, vthers sum freindschip fand
Sum gettis pleasure, vthers gettis tray and tene
Ze ken the Court can nocht ay stabill stand.
In Court that time was good David Lyndsay.
In vulgar tongue he bure the bell that day
To make meter, richt cunning and expart,
And Master Iohne Ballentyne suith to say
Make him marrow to David weill we may.
And for the third, Master Williame Stewart,
To make in Scottis, richt weill he knew that Art.
Bischop Durie, sum time of Galloway,
For his pleasure sum time wald tak their part.
And I my self with small Intelligence
Thocht in that case to schaw my diligence
To manifest my waik wit and Ingyne,
At their foursum as king leif and license,
With hat and hand keiling with reverence
Me for to leir ane lessoun or a line
Of their prettick to me ane point propyne.
They said go to, schaw sum Experience
And I thairfoir to them promeist the wine.
Sa at their four, quhen I had leif purchest,
To them (said I) quhat matter is ^etest?
For to begin (quod they) we wald e drew
Sum Dialog, or argument that is best,
And that will make our matter manifest.
Sa folk may know the false Tale be the true,
For Dialogs (quod I) weis get anew.
And sa fra them Incontinent me dressed,
And tuke good nicht, and said good schirs adieu.
Bot it knew not quhat my matter should be
Quhidder of mirth or it of gravity.
After Supper to bed I maid me boun,
Sa in my sleip me thocht I saw swythlie
Lady Venus, cumming and spak to me,
And said I am, cum with the for to ressoun,
Thairfoir my wordis, se that thou not chessoun,
Tuitching my stait, honor and dignity
Foret me nocht quhen thon makis thy Sermoun.
Sa on the morn quhen time was for to rise
I thocht I wald begin my Interpryse,
And rememberit on Venns Lady Queen
Kest in my mind ofter nor anis or twyse
That she bad me with her matter auyse,
And I knew small quhat her matter did mean
Considdering at me her self had been.
I wist nocht weill quhat matter to deuyse,
Her for to pleis, and to eshaip her tene.
And sa at schort my pen I tuke in hand
Began to write at Queen Venus command
Ane lytill Quair, I ken nocht gif e know it,
Embrowd about with barbarus terms bland
And with trym terms may vsit up on land
As to the Name Dame Venus Court they caw it
I wait nocht weill gif ever Schiris e saw it,
Delyuerit it unto my Masters sour
Quha it ressauit, and reddelie red ouir.
This lytill Quair, quhen they had red and endit
Sum said that hard, they greitlie it commendit,
And sa beliue delyuerit it again
To every verse thairin they condiscendit,
And said they wist, thairwith nane was offendit
Except it war ane prydfull pure Putane,
At quhais wordis men wald tak small disdane,
Quha that fand faltis, all four they wald defendit it
Be word and died, with micht and all their mane.
Ane proper wenche come to me on ane day
Ane of my Ants, bot thairto I say nay
My buke to borrow, greitlie scho did Inquyre
Ane wed thairfoir scho said scho wald down lay
Quhill scho it red, within ane Oulk or tway.
Sa I grantit that thing scho did desire,
Bot in few day is my Ant begouth to tire
Her Pyat tongue, her poet tongue I should say
Micht suffice weill to preiche in barn or byre.
My buke again scho brocht and callit it good
And said sum terms was scho not understood,
Because they war sa heich and curious
Meruellit at me how I durst ever dude,
Aganis women to speik sa ruch and rude,
And said I trow our mind was furious
Quod I Lady the matter standis thus
Quhen two arguis, in ane or they conclude
On force their talk mon be contrarious.
Thairfoir Maistres I mon hald ow excusit,
I traist sic terms befoir few times e vsit,
Or at the leist, e come nocht quhair they grew
I hard sum say that e war greitlie rusit,
And e our thocht and mind on sic terms mufit
Both into Greik, in Latin and Hebrew,
Now I persaue that they Tales are not true.
Thairfoir trewlie my self should have the pyne,
I was to bald to cast Peirlis to the Swyne.
Than scho me prayit with wordis sweit and fair
To be sa good to tak ane other Quair
In planer terms, and it in Meter make
Anents women, not tuitching them sa sair,
For our requeist (said I) I will do mair.
Ane other Roll I chancit in hand to take,
It to perform for that fair Lady is sake.
Maid and compylit be the wise Sages seuin,
Quha was that time may sapient under heuin.
For narurall wit, they ar all haldin plane
The springing well, and only fresche Fontane
The perfyte ground, and rute Original
Of this story, now following but lane,
Thairfoir my self, as now I am constrane
It to translait, in our tongue natural.
Quhair I it fand into plane prois at all
Without color or feit, now I again
In rural ryme, to set it forth I sall.
The fault I said, for her saik I should mend it
Quhair scho befoir with strange termis was offendit.
I promeist her of honesty to quyte them,
And with town terms my bow it should be bendit
Fra Clerklie terms my pen should be suspendit
And in my verse be na way I should write them,
Ze sall all know doutles that I despyte them.
On this debait than we war condiscendit,
At her desire I sall eschew to dyte them.
Sa we aggreit (quod scho) good Schir adieu
Quod I Lady, forsooth richt sair I rue,
With sa dry mouths, that we two should depart
Quod scho but dout, as I am traist and true
Sum other time my self sall ow persew,
Bot not as now, their is time after wart,
Quhen ever e pleis (quod I) welcum my heart,
For verray shame me thocht scho changeit hew,
Than turnit her bak, and sa we did depart.
Incontinent but any mair delay
I thocht it best my pen for till assay
This lytill buke in verse for to compyle
Quhair it befoir into plane prois was ay,
Gif I culd find any good wyle or way
To steir it up into ane better style,
That I should not this fair Lady begyle,
Considdering the same on hand I tuke
As e sall heir, thus I begin my buke.
Finit Prologus.
To the Reidar.
BECAVS I was reprouit of befoir,
That I should not in Clerklie terms gloir:
Bot in plain speiche my buik for to addres
With commoun talk, bot it never the les
This Tale of auld I hard quhilk is richt true,
And richt weill knawin, that neid often makis vertew
Thairfoir on force, because strange terms I want
I have na dout, bot heir they sall be skant.
Thairfoir in time I think best to deny them,
Zone fair Lady me think scho settis nocht by yame
Ane other cause siclike I wait e ken
For to bring but its Ill that's not their ben.
Nor their is nane, I wait in all this town
Except he have it, that can put on ane goun.
Of ane twme Twn, nane can draw out licour,
Nor of ane fule to make a wise Doctor.
For quhy wit wants, quhair wisdom should cum fra
Into this case, the matter stands sa.
Force me compellis, strange terms to forbeir,
Within my box thairs few to get or leir.
Quhair Gold is skant, silver mon us content,
Even sa it stands but dout at this present.
Praying hartlie this Tale in patience tak,
A man can sell nathing out of his pak
Bot as he hes, than present for the time,
Ze may persaue that be this roustie ryme.
Beseiking ow good Reidars to excuse it,
Not to detract, nor it ouir hie to ruse it.
This I wald wis my friends e wald do so,
Than in Goddis name to purpois let us go.
Heir beginnis the seuin Seages, translatic forth of prois in Scottis meter be
Iohne Rolland in Dalkeith.
IN Eldaris dayis often times it hes been tauld
That Rome hes been ane ^^etie of the auld
Of running Clerks and wonder vaileand men,
As ancient Acts makis us for to ken.
Ou^r all the world it had Preeminence,
All pepill maid to it Obedience.
With greit Captanes, Kings Knichts and Empreours
Kene men of weir and cruel Conquerours,
Of townis and towris, greit villages and cicteis,
Triumphand far abone their Enemeis:
Subdewand them to lest and servitude,
Not regarding their lynage, kyn nor viude.
Conquest grit realms, lordschips and rowms braid
Their commoun weill sa (...)ruellous rich they
That all countries and kigdomes the^ about maid
Of their fell feir greit dreddour had and dout.
That they on force beh^^d to make homage
Orellis have lo^st vaith life and heritage.
For they war sa repleit of all riches
(...) into weiris ve martial besynes.
They tuke na cure of na ma^ms favor nor feid
Sa they become of all the world the heid:
And had thairof the haill Authority,
Bot this was not in time of Papistrie,
For fra that time y^ Papis was maid in Rome,
Of all vertew that Cietie was maid tome.
And day be day fra all vertew decrest
Continually the self^t ay oppressed.
For three strangers raise up in that Cietie,
Quhilkis of befoir na way wald sufferit be,
The commoun weill cause they war ay agane
Thairm thairfoir they wald not those remane
Bot fra Papis come that Nobill town within
It did abound sa sair in deidly sin,
And that na stait to Clergy was compairs,
Sa weill they treit their three uncouth strangairs
Quhilk three their was, the first lurkand haitrent
The secund was, oung counsall and consent,
Singular profit it was the third I wis,
Quhilk three was cause to gar Rome go amiss.
And causit it tine the greit triumphand Name,
And to be callit the house of warldlie schame.
Tint the greit rowmes and warldlie possessiou^s
That they conquest fra diverse other Crowns.
All sit become throw wickitnes and vice,
Of the Papists, and their foul Merchandice.
For they wald gar ane pound of meltit leid
Bring them again the wecht of gold sa reid.
And gar the hippis of ane deid Zow or skin
Assole ow of all our deidly sin,
Incontinent in heuin up to be brocht,
Contrair Gods will, quhidder he wald or nothe
Bot not the les, lang time befo^r their dayis
Ane Empreour was as the Story sayis,
Quhilk hecht to Name ^ontianus at richt,
Ane Nobill man of wisdom and of micht.
G^d^t his Realm be wisdom and vertew,
To his pepill erempilis daily schew,
Of wisdom wit and Liberality,
Quhairthrow the hartis of all his folk wan (...)
That nane cairit to wair with him their life,
Ane Kings Douchter he had unto his wife,
Cal^^t Clara, ane woman verteous,
Fair and gudelyke and wonder gracious.
Quhilk ane knaif child of him scho did co^saue
Bot him alone na ma God to them gave,
Quhilk was callit D^oclesiane to Name,
Fair and well fauourit, both of fassoun and fame
Quha daily grew in vertew and gudnes,
Ilk man him lufit for his greit gentilnes.
For he was courts, cumlie and richt kind,
Fra all fulische alluterlie declynd.
Sa quhen he was seuin eir auid or neir by
This Empress tuke ane meruellous malady,
That scho behuid for to tak bed on force,
With sair seiknes sa troublit was her Corre.
Persauing weill be her Intelligence
For to eschew fra deid was na defense
Bot of her life schortlie to have ane end.
Sa for her spous the Empreour sone scho send.
With humbill heart and Inwartlie praying.
That he wald ^um to her but tarying.
Gif ever he wald se her upon live
Sa was fra hand direct sone ane Missyue.
Poist after Poist, quhair he lay in weilfair,
Sone till him come, and culd the cause declair,
But mair abaid, with wonder sor^e heart,
With few horse men fra his Camp did depart.
And quhen he come to the Empress presence
Scho said till him with humbill reverence.
O My good Lord, howbeit that I be seik,
Ze licent me my ^rand to ow speik.
Sa that it be only to our plesour,
And als siclike unto our greit honor,
He said Lady I se ow in diseis
Notwithstanding say on quhat ever e pleis:
And it sall be to me na vilanie,
Sa it eik not our greit Jufirmitie.
My Lord scho said, this seiknes I persaue
Or it depart will drive me to my grave.
He said Madame be e of good comfort,
Ze will recover our health I traist at schort,
For I sall send for all my ding Doctouris,
Phisitianes, and my Philosophouris,
My cunning men, and my Medicmars,
My Cirugians and als my Potingars,
My Practicianes quhilkis ar suttell and slhe.
That daily deilis with Flewbothomie.
They will consult, and Ilkane als persaue
All our seiknes, and sa health sall e have.
For seiknes is als natural as heill,
Thairfoir dout not y^ deith sall with ow deill,
At this present, bot e sall sone recure,
Quod scho my Lord of a thing I am sure,
This malady sa haldis me at the heart
Quhill I be deid, na way it will depart.
Quhairfoir my Lord, richt humbly I require,
Ze wald Incline our heart to my desire.
He said desire at me quhat ever e will,
I will it grant, thocht it be contrair skill
To comfort ow, and help ow fra diseis
Thairfoir say on, it sall me not displeis.
Scho said my Lord I thank ow gretumlie,
Quod he Madame say on quhat ever it be.
Scho said my Lord, plesit our Nobill grace
Of my desire, this is the verray case,
Quhen I depart out of this present life,
It will ow pleis to have ane other wife,
And as e know we have na barn bot ane,
Nor never had, bot only him allane:
Quhilk ouir all thing anixt our awin persoun
I wald war weill to this Ilk prouisioun.
After our deith with all wit and wisdom,
Reule his pepill, and gyde this greit Kingdom
And ouir all thing my Lord may I require
Into this point, e will grant my desire,
That our Empress percha^ce quhat cuerscho be
Upon my Sone have na Authority,
Na Governance, power nor it gyding
Bot e him put to other nurisching.
Far fra her sicht, and fra her company,
To that effect, that he may viceles be,
Of all vices, and sic thing as gais wrang
And ay to be, greit cunning men amang.
My Lord hartly this humbly I require
Into this point to fulfill my desire.
For weill I know, displesours ar to cum
That he sall do, or ellis he salbe dum,
Quhairthrow only his life he will recure,
My Lord I know but dout this salbe sure.
He said Lady our will e sall not want,
Thocht it war mair, richt hartly I it grant,
For that is my desire asweill as ouris
It salbe done, Madame at our plesouris.
Scho said my Lord I thank ow with my heart
God save our grace, for now I most depart.
This being said, scho tuke ane fell passioun
And ane lang space scho lay in deidly swoun.
Sa in schort time withouttm mair remeid,
Her natural det scho completit of deid.
With all triumph her funeral service
Was dewlie done, as that time was the gyse
La^g time after the Empreour maid murning,
And all his Court, for her sair departing
Na menstrell mirth nor it na merines
Into his hall was seen nor na blyithnes,
Bot heuines, greit dule and gravity
Into the Court, and all the company
For that good Queen, all solace was away,
Woir the dule weid Ilk ane for eir and day.
MORALITAS.
OF this matter sum thing we may collect
Of this Empri^e hauand ^a greit respect
And Inwart ^u^e unto her Sone alone
Of her awin health scho tuke ^ot ly^^ll rek,
Bot thocht scho wald his weilfair nocht neglect
Befoir to deith her self scho wald dispone
Quhilk causit her sit matters to propone
To her husband, for the samin effect
Her Sone to ring after that scho was gone.
Siclyke e may considder the greit rair
The thocht and mind scho tuke both lait and air,
Anent her Sone scho suffering sair sciknes
Prouyding als for his wealth and weilfair,
Desyring him of cummers to be clair
With the new Queen, he should have na entres,
Nor scho with him in any besynes,
For sum causis that micht occur perchance
That scho should have of him na Governance.
Alswa appeiris sum part of Prophecy,
And greit foirsicht hes been in this Lady,
Perrellis to cum, sa perfytelie to know
Scho being tuichit with sair Infi^mitie.
Praying to put, her Sone fra company
Of all the Court, and als of Ladyis aw*
And in special, fra his Mother in Law.
Inconnenients to eschew that ^^cht be
Sa scho desyrit, her Sone him for to draw.
The hartlie lufe siclyke e may persaif,
That this Lady to her husband did half,
Ran bring to him, honor and reverence,
And he to her, siclyke all things gave,
That scho desyrit, or at him scho wald crave:
Not regarding, thocht it had been offense,
And for her saik, quhen scho was deid and hence
He commandit that na blyithnes should be
For eir and day into his compa^e.
Thairfoir I say to ow in Marriage
Both into auld, and into tender age,
Quhat ever chance, e suid have Cheritie
B^ue Ill wordis cum, than lat our malice swage.
B^ue place to Ite, and harbrie not outrage,
Crabit at anis, na way both e should be
Ane meik answer slokin^ Melancholy,
Ze ar conionit ane flesh and Saulis two,
Than keip good lufe, the Scripture biddis sa.
How the Empreour committit and delyuerit his Sone to the seuin Doctouris of
Rome to leir.
THIS Empreour upon a time he lay
Intill his bed, and to him self culd say
I have na barnis bot ane Sone to my air,
I think it best that he war put to lair,
Stn he is oung, and into tender age
To leir wisdom he will tak mair curage
After my deith, this Realm that he may gyde
This I think best in time for to provide.
Sa on the morn he cryit after his clais,
And in dew time but mair abaid vprais.
Gart call his Lords, and counsall till him sone,
In this matter quhat they thocht to be done.
Schawing to them at lenth the haill matter
To his Lady quhat he had promeist air.
They answeritall, my Lord their is in Rome
Seum wysest men that is in Cristindome,
Quhilkis in learning all other they preuaill
In all wisdom, and Science Liberaill.
They ar but dout the seid of Solomon.
For to discus Problewm or it Questioun.
Lat ane Message to them be send but mair
Deliver them our Sone unto the lair
Of their counsall the Empreour was content,
for their Doctors ane Message sone was sent,
Under his Seill, and als his awin hand writ
To the Doctouris he bad deliver it.
Sa sone as they the letters all had red
To their veyage but tarry sone them sped.
Quhen they come to the Empreours presence
They salust him with laud and reverence,
On their best wise, as to them culd effeir
He said to them e ar all welcum heir.
I speir at ow have e any knawlege
Quhairfoir I send to ow seuin my Message.
They answerit him the cause na way we know
Quhill yt our grace will witchaif for to schaw
Zour graces will quhen e have schawin us to
That to fulfill, our power we sall do.
To quhome he said, I thank ow Masters all
Now unto ow my erand schaw I sall.
Ane Soue alone, na ma barnis I have,
Nor all my time na ma God to me gave:
Appeirandlie he is to be mine air,
Thairfoir I wald he war put to the lair:
To cunning men for to have their doctrius.
And in outh heid be under Discipline,
To that effect, after my fatal det
Into my place with honor he beset,
To reule his Realm with wisdom and Justice
Quhilk in ane Prince should cuerring alwayis.
Thairfoir I wald e seum should him ressaue,
And him to leirne and into gyding have,
And e sall be rewardit weill thairfoir,
Sa haill and feir agane e him restoir.
They thankit him all seum with reverence,
That he to them of his Sone gave credence.
Bot the first Master callit Pantyllas
Began and said, because he eldest was,
My Lord I sall, and pleis our Nobill grace
Cause our ane Sone within seuin eiris space,
Be als cunning in all the seuin Science,
Of wit, wisdom, and all Intelligence
As I, and all my marrowis that heir standis
Or any man, within our boundis and landis
Sa that e will deliver him to me,
This sall I do in pane of honesty.
The secund Master namit Lentalus,
Their wordis said unto the Empreour thus.
And pleis our grace deliver him to me
Within ser eiris he sall have mair Elergie,
Mair cunning craft in all the seum Science
Nor I and all that now is in presence.
And as e know I have seruit our grace
Sen I was man, in all my lyfis space.
And for rewaird I seik na other thing
Bot our ane Sone to have in governing.
Than spak the third ye namit was Craton
With our good grace I saillit the sey upon,
In greit perrellis, and dangerous weilfair
And of our grace rewaird I seik na mair,
To be sa good, to me deliver wald
Zour only Sone in governance to hald,
And I promeis that within eiris five
He sall be mair cunning and Scientiue,
Nor I and all my marrowis heir about
Dato our grace this I sall do but dout.
Than spak the fourt to name hecht Malqup, drak
And pleis our grace my service for to tak
In good sessoun, in thankis and plesouris
For I my self and my Progenitouris
Hes seruit ow, and ours our lyfis space
And na rewaird desire I of our grace
Bot to witchaif on mesa greit credence,
As for to leir our Sone perfect Science:
And for to be of cunning mair perfect
Nor I and all my marrowis can Indite.
This sall he do within nirt eiris four.
Or I Science and cunning sall gif ouir.
Tha^ spak the fyft, Josephus hecht his name
Lord I am auld and never vndefame
On our counsall, and hes been money eir,
Wald e leif me our ane Sone for to leir
I sall him tetche but dout in eiris three
Als greit cunning, and als perfect Clergy
As I my self, and all my marrowis can,
Or ellis e sall call me na honest man.
Na mair rewaird of our grace I desire
Thocht all my life I have seruit our Impire.
Than spak the sert was namit Cleophas
Ane Nobill man, and cunning Clerk he was,
And said siclike as the laif said befoir,
Of our good grace rewaird I seik no moir
Bot our ane Sone to have in governing
Inform and teiche, and into Science bring
In cunning he salbe within two eir
That he sall have na peregall nor peir.
Na mair rewaird at ow now ask will I
Quhilk our good grace I traist will not deny
Than said the seuint greit Master and doctor,
Unto our grace I will do sit plesour,
Give me our Sone in credence and gyding
Within ane eir I sall hun give leirning,
Sa profoundly in all the Science seuin,
And of all Science vnderueth the heum:
That in wisdom he sall have na conipair
Unto our grace this schortlie I declair.
For giftis of gold, nor geir I not re gaird
Nor for labouris I covet na rewaird
Bot our good will quhe^ the eir is forth gane
The Empreour hard, andtha^kit them Jikaus
And said I am Inde(...) to ow ^ll
^nrecompansit nane of ow their be sall.
Bot not the lessen I find ow sa kind
And with good willis hes schawin me our mind
Gif I should him commit till ane of ow
Than all the rest micht weill believe and trow
That to that ane I had mair affectioun
Than to the rest, quhilk should cause discentioun:
Discord Inun and also variance,
Qahilk in na sort amang sic men should chance.
Thairfoir to ow comunetlie all in ane
Heir I commit my Sone Dioclesiane.
My afald barn and cik my only Air,
With ow to be Instructit weill in lair.
And him to gyde in alkin honest sort,
Quhylis to wisdom, and quhylis to game and sport:
As e will answer Jik ane unto me.
In pane of credence and of our honesty.
For be he weill, eum sa I think my sell
Do as e pleis, as now na mair I tell.
Their dyng Doctors the sweit langage heiring
Of their good Lord, and alswa persauing
The greit credence, and siclyke the kyndnes
That he had schawin unto their semp^^nes.
They thankit him Ilkane upon their kneis,
Man after man, all seuin in their degreis.
Sayand to him, that his grace should be sure
Of their laubours greit diligence and cure.
The Empreour tuke his Sone be the hand,
And bad that he, at their bidding should stand.
And in na sort that he should them offend
Onto the time agane he for him send.
And sa at schort the barn delyuerit he,
Quhome they ressauit with all humility.
This being done, Ilk ane they tuke good nich^
To Romes Court the way they held on richt.
Their seuin Masters their veyage passing on,
Ane of them said quhilk namit was Craton
To his fellowis, sayand my brether deir
Sen we this Child in Governing hes heir,
I think not best to Romes town that we ride
Gif we list weill this barn gouetus and gyde:
For diverse causis and Impediments,
That may occur be Inconuenients.
Cysting the Child to money sport and play
And to neglect his study day be day.
For fra greit men get knawledge quhat he be,
They will coue^ daily his company.
Sa fra study he salbe a^ abstractit,
And we all seuin with greit displesure lackit.
The other sex said all with ane consent
His counsall was good and convenient,
And was said to the purpois by and by,
And with good will to the same wald apply
This to eschew, I wald remeid war found
For weill I know within ane lytill ground
To build upon, their is ane proper place,
Quhilk to us all war pleasure and solace.
Fra Romes town bot three miles distant.
Quhat thing we ueid, we myster not to want.
Let us pair make ane house both rowme and squa it
Quhair at quiet the child may leirne his lair
We sall gar paynt upon the wallis about
The seuin Science, with greit Storyis all out,
Sa that this Child may se vesie and luke,
And tak doctriue, asweill as in his buke.
This Counsall than applesit shame ever ilkane
The house was biggit sone of lyme and stane,
And weill compleit, as it best culd effeir,
Quhairin they all stud^it the seuin eir.
Quhilk been outrun, and all compleit togidder
The seuin Masters amang them did co^fidder

The Child walknit befoir the Sone rising,
And lyftit up his Ene unto the sky
And to the rufe of the house seruently,

And the wrytingis delyuerit sone hes he,

Both for commoun wealth and Croune, gif airs chancit faill

To cause him tak ane new Queen

Gif this Air war gane.
And sa belyue but pley to counsall be applyit
Cause it was the commoun weill he durst not deny it
Bot it his first Queen's desire, in sum part past by it
That to the court the child brocht, quhair he was sair inuyit
The Empreour not knew
Ze ken of auld this true Tal^
Nyce is the Nychtingale
The Empreour gave her credrence hale
And never word true.
Quhen women speikis fairest they ar may falls found,
They gar sweit li^our swym above, and g^ll is at the ground
They shaw them like ane turtill dow, and bytis as ane hound
The Empreour was dessau^t sair, as sone was after found
They war ay and salbe
Sa quesitiue both nicht and day
The Empreour culd na g^it say nay
Bot men should not trow that they say
Sa often because they lie.
How the seui^ Maisteris after the ^icht of the Empreouris Letteris wald first

commandment or not.
ALS sone as yir seuin masters had ouirsene

On the nixt nicht, all seuin with ane consent
Past to espy the sternis and Firmament.
To tak Jornay gif it was prosperous
Or contrair way, gif it was dangerous.
For to fulfill the Empreouris command,
Or gif they durst the samin to ganestand.
Anon they spy into the Firmament
Ane stormy stern that troublit their Intent.
Persauing weill be the stern gif that they
Their Jornay tuke, and raid that sam(...) day
To them affirt, be the Empreouris command
The Child but dout in greit perrell should stand,
For the first word that he spak in presence
Of his Father in oppin audience,
Should be the cause of his greit schamefull deid
This to eschew they culd find na remeid.
Quhairof they wa^ all sad and wounder sorry
And wi^t not weill to travel or to tarry,
Ane other stern than they beheld also,
Schawing to them to the King wald not go
And keip the day, quhilk was affixt them to,
To want their heids, their was nocht ellis ado
Ane of them said quhair two Illis dois appeir
Let us that tak quhairin lyis leist dangeir.
It is better surely I say for me
For this Impire that we all seuin should die,
And other seuin u^clicke as we are all
Or this oung man should suffer ouy thrall.
Thairfoir ^at us all seuin with ane Intent,
Our awin personis to the Empreour present,
And let the Child at have alone remane
To se give we, tarry or cummis agane.
And sa they war all seuin richt sorrowfow,
Pan^ing alwayis, quhat mean fassoun or how
They micht eschew this Inconvenient.
Sa this oung man come down Incontinent,
Fra his Chalmer, quhair he was studiand,
His seuin Maisteris all sittand their he fand.
Richt sorrowful, and sad in countenance,
He them Inquyrit, quhat was the cau^ and chance
Of their sadness, they said this standis the case,
We all beleuit till had of ow solace,

Bot now Fortoun hes been to ow sa hard,
That all sit thing to greit wanhap will turn,
Quhairfoir we all hes greit ^aus for to murne,
For all our Jo^, and our Felicity
Is like to turn to greit adversity.
He said Masters I pray ow to me schaw
How the case standis, it e will let me know.
They said the case that we can schaw to ow
Into the self is wonder sorrowfow,
For our Father the Empreour and King
Unto us seuin hes se^d ane schairp writing,
Commanding us withouttin tarying
On pan^ of lyfis that we ow ti^l him bring,
Juroutment at the nixt Penthecoist,
Their his wrytingis he hes send at the poist,
To quhat effect, we know not his Intent.

And we can se na other thing appeir
Bot haistelie without any remeid,
And e speik a(...)s e sall thoill suddand deid.
G^f we delay, and bring ow not him till,
Our deid is dicht, and in our Fatheris will*
The Child answerit agane richt humbly
I sair repent that sic ane thing should be.
Can e not find in that case na remeid
Bot outher I. or e to suffer deid?
Zit I mon pas and all the sternes spy
Gif I can find any remeid thairby.
That may put of that deidlie dolent hour,
And satisfy my Father the Empreour.
Incontinent he veseis ouir his buikis,
Sin^ after that unto the sternes he luikis.
Amanxg the rest ane proper stern he saw*
That was richt cleir perfect and wonder smaw
Quhairby richt weill considderit he the case,
G^ue that he culd abstene seuin dayis space
Fra all speiking and hald him self as dum

And axll their lifis in na perrell to be,
Quhilk sterue he leit all his seuin Masters se.
And said Masters behald and weill persaue,
Give I my self as dum man most me have.

All the perrell I sall avoid away.
And e ar seuin of all the world may wise,
I think it is bot ane small Interprise,
Ilk ane of ow to save my life ane day,
Quhen that is done, than sum thing I sall say,
That e and I fra all perrell salbe
The Maisteris s^uin concludit perfitelie.
All that he said was wonder Just and true,
For be the stern the sa(...) weill they knew,
And randerit thankis to Potestatis divine,
That their Scoller had sa perfect Ingine,
Of cleir cunning, sic ane stern to considder
Quhairby that they should all be saif togidder:
And out of dout, and all danger of deid,
Seuin dayis put by, him self to find remeid.
The first Master, Pantillas was his Name
Said that he should under the vane of schame,
For the first day befoir the King to stand,
To save his life partly he tuke on hand.
Quod Lentulus, quhilk was the nixt Doctor,

The secund day, and sa said all the rest,

This being said, all seuin with ane consent,
They cled this Child in ane new abilement,
In goldin clais, as effeirit his estait,
Sine lap on horse and fordwart maid the gait,
To Romes town, with all the speid they had
For to obey as the Empreour them bad.

And hald in honor our Parents.
Sa did this Child quhen that he saw
His Father be the way cummand
Down of his horse he lichtit law
On his kneis tuke him be the hand,
Als quhen his Father gave command
Hun for to speik, he bowit his heid
with humbill heart to him menand
I dar not speik for feir of deid.
Sit thing his Father na way kend
Bot quhen the Queen come in presence
Jucontinent he bad him wend
with her to Chalmer, and go hence
The Child with all Obedience
Past at command howbeit he knew
That it wald cause ane greit Offense,
Kend weill that race that he wald rue.
Euin sa we should be all and ane
To our Parents Obedient,
And give our awin be deid and gane
The Principal ay, is remanent,
That is our Father all Potent
^e feidis us with his haly hand
Than let us set our hadl Intent
On our best way ke^p his command.
How the Empress led Dioclesiane to her Chalmer for to make merines, quhilk
appeirandlie he withstude.
THE Empress than su^ Ladyis callit her till
Sayand this is my utter mind and will,
That e prepair my Chalmer and my bed
With Silk badkins, that it be weill ouirspred
And all the house weill houng with Tapestrie,
They said Madame, as e bid sa sall be.
Than the Empress tuke Dioclesiane
Be the richt hand, and to Chalmer is gane,
And causit avoid all the Chalmers anon,
Nane baid thairin bot they two them alone.
Scho thocht not best nane other their should bide
And set him down befoir her awin bed side:
And said to him their wordis in ane part
O best belouit Dioclesiane my heart:
Often times I have hard speik of our beauty,
Zour wit, wisdom, and our greit courtasie,
Zour greit vertew or ever I ow saw,
I covet ow much both to se and know,
I am richt blyith my sweit Dioclesiane,
That we two now ar sa secreit alane.
I wald have given within this eir ago
Ten thousand pound for to have had it so.
And I am glaid that now I may behald
The samin thing that my heart alwayis wald.
And I have causit our Father for ow send
To that Intent, and for that fynall end,
That I may have of our body solace,
And now sen we are heir in secreit place,
For without fauir I say to ow planel^e
I have keipit my clean virginity
To ow trewlie, unto this present hour
Notwithstanding our Father the Empreour
Hes maryit me, it I wald not consent
In that behalf to fulfill his Intent:
Bot at all tines hes waitit upon ow,
Quhairfoir of me e tak our pleasure now:
And speik to me, and let us go to bed,
Sen I my self now thairto hes ow led.
Quhat ever scho said, quhat ever scho did or wro rht
For all her talk ane word he answerit nocht
Scho seeing that, to him scho said agane,
O my sweit heart, and good Dioclesiane,
I sweir ow heir, be Peter and be Panil,
In our keeping e have my life and Saull.
Quhat is the cause to me e will not spetk?
Schaw me of lufe sum takin I beseik.
For as e know I am ane oung Lady,
And to perform our will am heir reddy.
Sa in her arms diverse times scho hynt.
Him to have kissed, to his mouth maid ane mynt,
He turnit his heid, and wald not thole her kis
In her a win mind (quod scho) quhat thing is this
That to this man profferis my body,
And be na way he will consent to me.
Diorlesiane my only lufe sche said
Sen that my lufe sa firm is on ow laid:
Quhy do e this, to be to me unkind,
Knawing richt weill e have my heart and mind
And their is nane that may persaue or se,
Quhat that is done into this house bot we.
Thairfoir grant me the thing that I ow ^raif,
And e thairfoir my Madinheid to haif,
He wryit his face away and his visage.
For bena way he lykit her langage.
Persauing than that scho culd not obtene
His lufe nor favor, bot it denyit cleue.
Scho said my lufe, and sweit Dioclesiane
Behald my Payis, behald my quhyte breist bane
Quhilk heir I put in our will and plesour
And clean forsaikis our Father the Empreour.
For quhy he is both febill waid and auld,
Lene of body and als of nature cauld.
In his outh heid sa vaileant hes been
That new in eild he is consumit clean.
That he skarslie may stand upon his feit,
Quhairfoir to me nor sic he is not meit.
At our pleasure thairfoir my body tak,
He seeing this, his heid he t^rnit bak,
That be na sign, nor other countenance
Into na sort he wald do her plesance.
But in sa far as he culd him remufe,
Scho micht persaue that scho wantit his lufe.
Quod scho agane, gif it plesis ow norht
To speik to me, nor it schaw me our thocht.
As may perchance be done for sum good quhy,
Into that case, ercuse ow weill will I.
Zit not the les, I wald e did Indyte
Upon paper, and our mind to me write,
Ze pleis not speik, tak their paper and Ink,
Beseikand ow to write me quhat e think.
Gif efterward our lufe I may obtene,
In secreit wise, that nane wait quhat we mean.
Sa the paper and Ink he did ressaue
And wrait as heir after e may persaue.
O Lady fair I pray God me defend
Fra sic mischance that I se ow Intend,
Gif I defoull my Fatheris awin Orchaird,
My Fatheris Ire I get for my rewaird:
Nor I wait not quhat fruit thairof sall spring.
And als I know richt weill ane other thing
That Goddis wraith but faill sall fall on me,
Thairfoir at schort lat all sic folly be.
Provoke me not na farther hidderto,
For I will schaw the matter gif e do.
Als sone as scho the Cheoull had out red,
Under her feit Incontinent it tred.
And syne agane with her teith scho it raif,
Thairof the Tert, that na man should persaif.
All her heid geir scho kest it on the flure
Raif down her clais, and all her rich vesture.
Raif down her hair, and skartit her visage,
Quhill blude ran down ouir all her personage.
That all micht heir scho cryit with ane loud voce
Fie help for schame, or I my life will lois.
This rude Ribald wald reueis me with schame
Persaue this Child now give he seruis blame.
Was never woman sen first the world began
Sa cruelly dressed, with ane unfaithful man.
That I lippinnit na harm should to me done,
O e my Lords, cum heir and help me sone.

How the Empress complenit to the Empreour of the shame done to her be his Sone
Dioclesiane.
THE Empreour with his Lords in the hall
Hard the loud schout, and sort preteous call
Of the Empress all haistelie they forth rau
Money greit Lord, Knichts and gentilman.
The Empreour come first quhair y^ was y^ queen
And said Madame, quhat have e hard or seen
To do ow noy, anguische or displesour
O fie scho said heir is ane greit Tratour
Ze call our Sone, bot our Sone is he notht.
Had he been ouris sic thing he had not wrocht
I wait it was never hard of beforne
In all this world sen any man was borne
That sic ane knaif sa hie thing to presume
As to defoull the great Empress of Rome
Thairfoir my Lord sen e ar Empreour
This matter may rynds to our greit honor.
Correct e not sic thing and make remeid
I reck nathing how sone that I be deid.
For good causis to Chalmer I him led,
Sine like ane knaif he wald defoulit my bed
I chereist him with wordis of greit comfort,
To speik to me, I did him often erhort.
On foull badrie his mind was only set,
Fra time he saw his willis he culd not get
At his pleasure, he maid him me deforce
Contrair my will, and sa hes rent my Corce.
With effusioun of blude all abundant,
And believing na other thing Instant
Bot haistie deid, war not I gave aue schout.
Considder weill gif I stude than in dout.
^e may persaue be my ab(...)ement
The treuth heirof how that he hes it rent.
The sin and schame of this harlot to fle
Ilk man map know how he hes done to me.
Thairfoir my Lord, as I have said befoir,
I ow desire e wald cause to restoir
My greit honor, and my worschip agane
That this Rebald falls Dioclesiane
Wald fra me rent forcelie aganis my will,
Or cllis our bed I sail never cum till.
Quhen that the ^ing this matter hard and saw
He was Inflambit with cruel Ire and gaw.
Malice wodnes, and greit Melancholy,
Was na remeid bot that his Sone should die.
Callit Sergandis and gave them strait command
On ane Gallous they should him hang fra hand
Tha^ said the Lords y^ stude the Empreour neir,
And pleis our grace sum of our wordis to heir.
Lord as e know, e have na Sonnis bot ane,
Quhairfoir we all hes greit cause to make mane,
And gif e had we think all verralie
^our present Sone war abill for to die.
Bot not the les with sa haistie Intent,
We think not best we say with ane consent
^our only Sone that e sa sone put down
Without ordour of Law or promsioun
The Law is maid to punische trespassouris
All geuin to evil and mischant transgressouris
And gif sa be that he be found the same
Than be ordour lat the Law him condame:
That ^a man say that the greit Empreour
His only Sone in wodnes and furour
Without the Law hes put his Sone to deid,
Pleis our greit grace to this matter tak heid.
The Empreour to sic wordis gave audience,
And said my Lordis of me e have credence
Within this Realm to leid Justice and Law,
Thairfoir I will consent weill to our saw.
And als I think it richt expedient
He be condampnit in ane plane Judgment.
Than command was to put him in presoun,
Their to remane without any ransoun,
Unto the time that Justice Court should stand
Than four Jewellours ressauit him fra hand,
In deip presoun richt schairplie him Inclusit,
Q^hairin befoir the Child was never vsit.
Now lat him sit, God cover him of cair,
Of the Empress let us speik farthermair.
Quha perseueirit in malice and greit Ire
Aganis this Child, as any byrnand fire.
As soon as scho had gottin true knawledge,
That this oung man was put in presonage
Not put to deid, sa suddanlie as scho wald,
Scho cryit, schoutit, and muriut monyfald,
That the Palice scho causit be all on steir
It was greit pane her for to se and heir
Than her Ladyis to her Chalmer thocht best,
Her to conuoy, thairin for to tak rest.
Quhe^ (...)ht was cum, ye King to Chalmer past
And fand his Queen weiping and murning fast
Wringing her hands sobbing and siching sair,
The King was noyit to se her make sic cair.
To quhome he said, O my deir Lady gent,
Quhat is the cause that e sa sair lament?
Scho said my Lord, know e not all the ^ace,
How our cursed Sone hes maid bludie my face.
And wald me put to utter displesour
War not our self, and vthers maid succor.
^e cammandit, him for to hang fra hand,
Zit not the les, on life he is leifand.
Nor our command is not obeyit at all,
Nor it my schame na way is maid to fall.
Quhairfoir my Lord, I think that e stand (...)
Upon our Sone, to leid Justice and law.
Than to the Queen the Empreour can say,
Madame sa sone, the morn as it is day
All our desire to fulfill and Intent,
He sall but dout thole Justice in Judgment.
Quod scho my Lord, sall he it leif sa lang,
Quod he Madame, lat this ane nicht ouirgang
Than micht sic chance on ow cum haistelie
As on ane Burges come of this Cietie.
As it was schaw in the treuth unto my sell,
Quod he Madame, I pray ow that to tell.
At our pleasure (quod scho) it salbe done,
Sa her Sermon on this wise began sone.
MORALITAS.
ZE se this Queen be wayis wrang
Willing put down this proper Chyle
Be cursed consait and lesing strange,
To deid him to convict and fyle
And als her King persuaid, to trow all that scho said
With money wrink, falls way and wyle
Bot it scho was set by her style, be good counsall he had.
Quhilk causit him to prolong the time
Be good counsall unto the morn
Quhair they best culd try out the crime
And clen ge the caffe out fra the corn
It is good to put by, ane evil hour sa say I
Or ane Innocent be forlorn
And he of sa greit lynnage borne, this is my cause and quby
For give this Queen had gottin her w(...)
The King had it repent it fair
Without tin counsall or good skill
For to distroy his Sone and Air
Quhilk greit piety had been quhil the treuth had been seen
^uengeance on her ever mair
This Child that caryit in sic cair, And cursed be sic a Queen.
Quhen thou oung man cummis to good age
Give any tune it chancis the
Be gift of God wit and knowledge
Ane chosm Judge than for to be
Give any fault be done, cause to correct it sone
Bot first that thou ba^th heir and se
The talking of the nixt party, than thou thy wit adione.
Give their occurris cause or querrell
Be not to swyft to give sentence
For thairin standis richt greit perrell
Dout and danger with negligence
Be the matter obscure, than thou should be richt sure
Be witness and Experience
Lat Ilk ane use their dew defense, euin to rich as to p^^^
Se thou use ay ane good Counsall
Of that be sicker at thy side.
And sa lichtlie thou sall not faill
Quhat ever chance for to betyde
Good counsall is the ground, quhair faithfulness is found,
It can persaue and als provide
And fra all perrell for to gyde, within ane lytill stound.
For give thou haistelie pronounce
Sentence ouir sone to rich or pure,
The same na way thou may renounce
Nor in na sort agane recure
Without tin ^ak and shame, dishonor and defame
Thairfoir thou should be wonder sure
That thou to na man do Iniure, or else thou seruis balm
Now to ow Judges I will say
Eschew fra wraith and greit furour
Lat mercy meis our mind always
Lat ressoun reule our greit Rankcour.
In na point be partial, our Balance beir equal
Than do e God ane greit plesour
And to our self purches honor, and wynnis good word of all
To know quhat the Empreour, the Empress, the oung Child, and the seuin
Doctouris signifyis.
OR we proceid it farthermair,
Of this matter sum thing will schaw
Quhat ilk thing menis for to declair
The matter better e will know.
This Empreour that leidis the Law
He signifyis a mannis persoun
That walteris betuix wind and waw
Into this world ay up and down.
His Sone betakins the Saull of man
Quhilk in the corpse is ay Inclusit,
The Empress Signifyis Satan,
Quhilk ever oppin malice musit.
The seuin Doctouris a seuin vertewis
Fechtand contrair seuin deidlie sinnis,
Quhilk that the silly Saull persewis
Fra to distructioun it beginnis.
The seuin dayis this Child is dum
Of mannis life they ar the space,
For in this world fra he first cum
De nener hes perfyte solace,
Quhill that God tak him in his grace,
And foret all this warldlie lust.
Than speikis he to God face to face
Quhen that the Devil he hes vincust.
Euin sa of this Empress Tale,
Tauld for to tempt the Empreour
Trowand perfytelie to preuaill
And of this Child to be victour
Tellis on her Tale for his plesour
Of quhilk the Empreonr was content
As e sall heir good Auditour
Thairfoir to purpois let us went.
The first Tale of the Empress is of the good tree that grew in the Burges
Gardine, and for the Imp that grew beside it he gart cut the greit tree.
IN Romes Town remanit ane rich Burges
Quhilk had at wealth all mirth and merines
With fair biggings, quhilk was both braid and hie
With gay gardings, yat was plesand to se
Of alkin flouris he had thairin ane part
That was to get about in every art.
To tell their Names I neid not now tak tome
Few was siclyke, sa plesand in all Rome.
In this Gardine their grew ane Nobill try
Quhilk every eir brocht forth fruit good ple^tie
Sine by all this the fruit that on it grew
Was sa done sweit, and of sa greit vertew.
Quhat man that had any sair Malady,
As is Liper, Erces or Popplecie.
Sa sone as he of this fruit gat ane taist,
Of all seiknes he wald be haill in haist.
And sa it chancit upon ane haly day,
This Burges went in his Garding to say
His Orisouns, and behalding this try
Ane gay oung Imp behynd it quyetlie
He saw growand, quhilk was proper and fair,
Incontinent he callit the Gairdnair.
He said good friend se e be wonder sure,
And of this Imp daily that e tak cure,
For I believe to have ane better tree
Of that oung plant and better be sic three
Nor is the auld, quhilk I can not auance
That pith Inlaikis, sap sapour and substance.
Howbeit this tree be far growin it abone,
The Gairdnar said. Master it sall be done.
Within few dayis to schaw the for certane
To se this plant the Burges come agane,
Quhilk as he thorht, was not half sa plesand
As it was quhen, the first day he it fand.
To the Gairdnar he said how can this be
My tender plant, appeiris not to me
Half sa plesand, as it was the last day.
He said Master, now tak tent quhat I say
Na wonder is, this auld tree is far mair
And fra the oung takis all substance and air.
Be the ressoun the branches ar so braid.
Sa the oung plant is sa vnliklie maid.
For gif this plant gat the substance and air
That this tree gettis, belyue it wald grow mair,
Nor is the auld for eild almaist is deid,
The Burges said thairof I wait remeid.
Cut down the bewis and branches of the auld.
Quod he Master, I sall do as e have tauld.
And sa he did, syne after in schort space
To se the plant, agane come the Burges,
And saw richt weill, that the same tender plant
Sum neidfull thing it did Inlaik and want.
To the Gairdnar he said how chancis this
My tender plant it dois misthriue I wis.
Schaw me the cause thairof without lesing,
He said Master. I suppois of ane thing,
That is the hicht of this greit growand tr^
Haldis away the Sone as thinkis me.
Quhilk geuis life, and nurisching but dout
Co alkin thing that ever grew thairout.
And als the rane it may not cum it neir
Quhilk nurischis also sum time of eir.
Their two wanting, their is na tree ean thrine
The Burges said, that sall we mend beliue.
Cut the auld clean, and quite down be the rute,
For I suppone we sall get better fruit,
Of this oung tree, nor of the auld was had,
The Gairdnar did as his Master him bad.
Cuttit the auld, and leit the oung stand still,
Sa he obeyit his Masters mind and will.
After schort time as this was done and wrocht,
Both auld and ou^g perischt and come to nocht
Quhairof greit harm and dule come to the pure
For quha was seik, of their health they war sure
Hauand recours unto that Nobill try
Quhilk to cut down, it was ane greit piety.
And quhen the pure persauit it was cut down,
They cursed waryit, with money malesoun.
That any way thairto gave their counsel,
Or helpit thairto they quite condampnit to hell
For quhy the pure of all Infirmiteis
War ay weill cutit of all their Maladeis.
Quod scho my Lord now have e understand
Quhat I have said, quod he that I warrant,
Quod scho the Mairch heirof I sall declair
The quhilk pertenis to our vnsonsie Air.
The declaratioun of this Tale tauld be the Empress.
THIS auld tree is our awin Nobill persoun,
That with counsall of our Lordis of renou^
The pure and seik dois ay help and supply
Be our Justice and greit Nobility.
This oung plant is, our awin buthriftit Air,
Zow to distrop, he castis him ever mair
Be his cunning growand up gre be gre.
As did the Imp behind the mekle tree.
And for to cause to cut the branches down
Quhilkis ar our Lordis nixt our awin persou^
That he may ring and sit into our chyre,
This is his mind that he dois may desire,
Of this matter than quhat sall after fall
All the folk sall murne, weip schout and als call
And wary them that cuttit down the tree,
Quhair that they wont to get help and supply
Or gave cou^sall this oung Imp for to nurische
Bot it distroy or it bure fruit or flurische.
My counsall is thairfoir the Imp cut down,
Sen it our self ringis in our hie Renoun.
And suffer not the oung Imp for to grow,
For he sall do daily that ever he dow
Zow to distroy, and our body put down,
And purches not the Maledictioun
Of the pure folk quhome to e war saifgaird.
Thairfoir in haist tak our sone forth of waird
And but delay, on Gallous gar him hing,
Ze doing this, e do like ane wise King.
The Empreour said, Madame now be the rude
Zour counsall is, both hailsum, wise and good
The morn he sall go to the deid may vylde,
Howbeit he be my only gottin Child.
The morn become, he callit his Lordis all
Togidder past unto the Justice hall.
The Empreour him selfsat in Judgment.
On pannall put his Sone Incontinent.
And sa at schort he was condampnit to deid,
To be hangit, on Gallous but remeid.
With mortal sound than passand him beforne
Of rrumpet, schawme, and als of blawing horn.
As the use was quhen any man should die,
Should be conuoyit with siclyke menstralie.
And as he past down throw the greit Cietie,
The pepill murnit, sayand it was piety,
The only Sone of the Empreour to hang
Money murnit, money their hands wrang.
In mean sesoun as he past down the streit.
His first Master Pantillas culd him meit.
The Master saw he was to Gallous led,
With speid of Spurris, to the Palice him sped.
To quhome the Child sa sone as he him saw,
Down with his heid than he Inclynit law.
As he wald said Master gif e be kind,
Now in my neid, I pray have of me mind.
For I am now, without e get mercy
Condampnit heir, on Gallous for to die.
Ze may weill wit than he na tarry maid,
Bot in all haist unto the Palice raid,
Zit not the les unto the Ministeris.
Prouestis, Sergands, Jewillours and Officers
He maid requeist, that they should haist nathing,
For he beleuit to get grace fra the King.
To save his life, he sall not die this day,
Than war they glaid, to ow the suith I say.
All in ane voce the pepill bad him haist,
Sa without baid he raid as he war chaist.
At the Palice he lichtit of his horse,
Quha should him dicht, he tuke bot lytill force.
Of the Empreour belyue he gat presence,
To quhome he gave on kneis greit reverence,
As him effeirit, to guhome the Empreour said
War not I will our reverence not degraid,
Ze and the rest richt sair should puneist be,
For our rewaird, e serve na mair of me.
He said my Lord and pleis our Nobill grace
Tha^ I have spent richt Ill my seum eiris space
Taking laubouris on our sone day and nicht,
In good doctrine him teichand as I micht.
Zit our laubouris at all we nocht regaird,
Bot beleuit weill to get better rewaird.
The empreour said thou leis Doctor but dout
First unto the, sine to the rest about,
My only Sone weill speikand haill and feir
I delyuerit, now e have brocht him heir
With na manners, bot doytit, daft and dum,
And mair at tour to schaw the all and sum
Thocht he be dum sic thing mon cum on chance
Be Goddis will or his good Ordinance.
Bot by all this he purposit quhilk was wors
My awin Lady, on maistres to defors.
And all her face with her rich Ornament,
In greit malice he hes all reum and rent.
Thairfoir this day he sall not faill to die,
And after him thou and thy company.
The Master said with wordis mylde and meik
As for our Sone e say that can not speik.
The Lord of all that matter weill he knawis,
As e sall know he is not dum but cause.

Ane thousand him sall heir speik on ane day.
As for our wife, my Lord quhair e allege
Quhair that he wald, have done to her outrage
On treuth my Lord I sall schaw ow but weir
In company with us this money eir,
As is weill kend, continually hes beue
Sic thing of him was never hard nor seen.
Thairfoir good Lord for our greit reverence
To sic void sawis gif not ouir sone credence.
For give e cause our only Sone to die
For the false wordis of our wyfis vanity.
On chance it sall far wors to happin ow,
Nor to ane Knicht, quhairof I sall tell now,
That for the wordis of his vane wantoun wife,
Gart him bereif his gay Grewhound the life.
Quhilk sauit his sone fra slauchter of the serpent
Than said the King tell me forth that Legent.
Pantillas said than to his Souerane
Gif I sa did, than war my Tale in vane.
For or my Tale war all compleit but dout.
Of our ane Sone the life may be put out.
And than my Tale for nathing it war tald.
Bot gif our grace of our greit mercy wald
Reteir our Sone fra the Gallous agane,
Than I wald think my Tale war not in vane.
Thairfoir gif that our Grace plesis to heir,
Ze cause our Sone quhill the morn reteir.
That being done, than on the morn e may
Do our Intent quhen it is fair licht day.
The Empreour than schortlie to conclude.
With heuie mind this talk weill understood.
And causit the Child for to be callit agane
Unto the morn in presoun to remane.
Than this Doctor richt plesandlie began
To tell his Tale but aw of any man.

And his was not witles, both tree and fruit he wantit
The gardner not saikles, to cut sa sone that grantit.
It was evil done, sa sone, to cut it down
Thocht it above, con^one, waid not weill soun
With the oung tree, to be, at diuisioun

The Tale of Pantillas the first Doctor.
INTO ane Realm their wynnit ane vailea^t knicht
Of nobill fame, of greit riches and micht
That had ane sone, my Lord now as e have
To three Nuresis to foster he him gave,
The first Nureis to give him suck and feid,
The nixt him wesche, and keip him clean at neid.
The third to bring him unto sleip and rest,
The Nobill Knicht for his barn thocht it be st.
This Knicht also he had ane gay Grewhound
That nane mair swyft, did rin upon the ground
Also he had ane Falcon fair of flicht,
Richt swyft of wing quhen scho likit to licht.
Their two the Kincht lufit abone measure,
Because often times they did him greit pleasure.
This Grewhound was sa swift and of sic speid
Quhen he was lousit his pray he gart ay bleid
And the same pray brocht to his Lord anon,
This was ane cause he ^^fit him allone.
Also quhen that this Knicht past to battle,
Gif that his chance that time wald not preuaill
Into his mouth his horse taill wald he tak,
About his luggis, often times he wald it srhaik.
Syne oull and cry, as he wald quyte rin wode
Sa be that Sign, the Knicht wrill understood
Gif at that time he wald further dr^o,
And sa often times lest him to battle go.
His Halk also was safeirce in her flicht,
Sa swyft of wing* and als sa wonder wicht
That scho was never east of till assay,
Bot without fault scho brukit ay her pray.
Their war causis this Hound and Halk he lufit,
Because to mirth they rasit him often and mufit.
Also this Kniche kest all his haill Inteut
In horse rinning, Justing and Tornament.
Sa on ane day he causit to protlame
At his Castle, to set fordwart his Name
Quha wald cum their to Tornay or Justing,
Breiking of speiris, and als of horse ryn^^ng.
At the set day, to be matchit should not fai^^,
This was the cry, and sa to schort my Taili,
The Knicht him self first enterit in the field
To the tornay, with harnes horse and s^heild.
Sine after him past his fair Lady gent
With her Ladyis to se the Tornament.
Sine after that, past all the Nuresis three
The Tornament for to behald and se.
Lokking the dures, leuing the barn alone,
Traisting Ischie nor entry should be none:
Quhill the Tornay, and Justing should be done
Than in all haist, they should return richt sone,
Beleuand weill the barn not to awalk,
Nane being their, bot the Hound and the Halk.
And the oung Child, that in the Creddill lay
Except their three, the rest all past away.
That na man knew, lay lurking in the haw
Ane greit Serpent befoir na man did know.
Quhen scho persauit the house sa desolait,
And nane thairin that durst with her debait.
Out of her hole sone scho put forth her heid
At this Infant hauand ane cruel feid.
Quha lay sleiping in the Creddill alone,
Him to deuoir, at schort sa is scho gone.
The Falcon this behalding quhair scho sat,
Upon her Perk, to do scho wist not quhat,
Bat with her wingis scho russillit and rang her bell lis
Almaist scho had al schakin yame in schellis
Sa with the noyis and beir quhilk maid the Halk
This good hound raise, and of his sleip did walk
And quhen he saw that the Serpent did creip
Towart the Creddill, quhair that the barue did sleip
With ane fell faird on the Serpent he ran
And sa at schort their two to fecht began,
Sa cruelly, that it was greit meruaill
Quhilk of the two at that time should preuail^
Ane to deuoir the other to defend
Their two at lenth togidder did contend.
Sa lang at lenth their two togidder faucht,
Amaist the hou^d al quyte had loist his maucht.
Sa cruelly he was woundit in blude,
That all about quhair that the Creddill stude,
Was blude berum, that meruell was to se,
Betuir sit two sa bauld bargane to be.
The Grewhound than persauing his awin blu de
Into his heart worcester sa cruel and wode,
With ane fell faird upon the Serpent ran.
Sa them betuix ane new bargane began.
With sic malice, melancholy and Ire,
Quhil ane was deid, yat nane of yame wald tire
Nor leif the field, quhill it chancit at the last,
Betuix them two, the Creddill ouir they cast.
With boddum up, and on the Toris it stude,
Quhair it was all about berun with blude.
Sa it become, and fell be Goddis grace
That the four Toris sauit the Childis face.
And sleipit still with visage toward the ground
Their two fechtand the Serpent and the hound
Quhill at the last the hound into certane,
This fell Serpent he hes ouircum and slane.
And sauit the Child fra perrell in that tide,
Quhen all was done, down be the Creddill side,
Licking his woundis lan down this nobil hou^d
For fechting fair and sa on sleip fell sound.
Beside this Bab, qu^^lk in the Creddill lay,
Nane in the house, bot only their same tway.
The Bab sleiping, and ^is^ na kind of Ill,
The hound werie, and foch(...) forth his till.
The Serpent slane, as I said ow befoir,
The Babie saif, and the hound woundit soir.
And so anon after this tornament
Ilk man woman unto their ludgeing went.
To tell that day quha wan the Interpryse,
That erand now to my matter not lyis.
Thairfoir as now that thing I will lat be,
And let us speik of the Nuresis three.
Quha first come hame and enterit in the haw,
Sa sone as they the blude and creddill saw.
Wringing their handis and ryfing down their hair
Crying allace woe on us ever mair.
Our only Child our Bab and fosterbarne
Is quyte deuoirit, with ane Dog and forfarue.
Allace for woe, allace quhat sall we do,
We ken na place for succor to rin to.
Give our Master perchance us apprehend,
Their is nane may fra his handis us defend.
Bot always sall on us cum suddand deid,
We know na way quhair we may find remeid,
Sen sa is cum let us in haist all three
To save our life, but baid away to fle.
Euin sa they did, and left the house alone,
But mair counsall all three away is gone.
And had na wit nor wisdom in their heid
To se quhidder the barn was quick or deid,
Nor lift the Creddill, and to persaue the case,
Bot ran away all three crying allace.
And as they war sa passand forth the streit,
Their awin Maistres they thancit for to meit
With her Ladyis cumming fra the ^ornay,
Scho persauing her Nuresis in the way,
Richt sair murning and ryfing down their hair
All woe begane, repleit of sturt and cair.
Sone scho Inquirit at yame how stude the case
They answerit her a thousand tunes allace.
Quhat sall we say for wordis to multiply
Their is na bute all man the case may se.
Aue Devil Madame into ane Doggis skin
Hes slane our Sone, alone our hall within.
To the quhilk Dog my Lord gave may delight,
Bot now he hes of our Sone maid ow quite.
In takin it quhair that the Creddill stude,
The Dog sleipis still new bathit in his blude.
He was the Dog that my Lord lufit best,
He was na Dog, bot with ane Devil possessed,
Thairfoir Lady, for us is na remeid,
Bot outher fle, or else to bide the deid.
Thairfoir Madame of us e have mercy,
This is the cause that causis us to fle.
This scho heiring, anon fell to the ground,
Without mair space into ane deidlie sound.
And it at last Ladyis gart her awalk,
Held up her heid, quhill scho began to talk,
And said allace, my deir Sone art thou slane.
Sall thou never play on my kne agane?
Sall I never with my Pay se the play?
Allace how sone art thou sa went away.
Sall I never the lauchaud on me se?
Allace how is the dolor chancit me?
Quhairin I had my only may plesour,
Saifand my Lord, both be tide time and hour
Is now but dout, with ane Dog clean deuorit,
And never agane to the life be restorit.
Quhat sall I say, this is ane cairfull case.
My only Sone is deid and gave allace,
Sa scho murning in greit dolor and woe,
The pepill about, that seeing did richt so.
Murmt richt sair, and of her had piety,
In sic dolor, that Lady for to se.
In the mean time the Knicht fra his Tornay.
Reteirit hame, and sa saw be the way
His aw(...) Lady, lamenting in dolor,
Requirit the cause of all her displesour.
Scho sayis my Lord, allace and ever mair
I can not speik for greit dolor and cair,
Is happ(...)t us ane wonder cruel case,
Our Sone is slane, for ever mair allace
With our Grewhou^d quhome yt sa weil e lufit
Now all that lufe on our Sone he hes prufit.
He hes him slane, in Creddill quhair he lay,
^our Nuresis all three ar fled away.
And it the place quhair that the Creddill stude
^our hound lyis sleiping in our Sonnis blude
This our Grewhound withoutt(...) helpis ma
Our only Child all quite hes taken us fra.
Quhairfoir my self unto the hour I die
Sall never eit, quhill I reuengit be
Upon our hound, quhilk hes my ane sone slane
Nor in our bed sall never cum agane,
Quhill he be deid that gart my ane Sone die,
Bot woe allace, this is na mendis to me.
Howbeit it be ane syithment to my heart,
^it my greit woe it slokins in sum part.
Thairfoir my Lord, gif e think it be done,
Without delay, gar sla our Grewhound sone.
The Knicht heiring their sorrowful tidance
How to his Sone had fallin sic mischance.
Hamewart in haist but baid he maid him boun
And in the clois quhen he was lich^it down
The Grewhound hard horsemen into the clois,
Amang the laif he knew his Maisteris voce,
And up he raise in the blude quhair he lay
To his Master the hie gait come his way,
Faint and foirfocht, come fawnand to his feit
As he had wont, his Master for to meit.
Into greit Ire, quhat is their mair to say,
With his scharp sword he claif his heid in tway
And that only for ane word of his wife
Gat his rewaird, that sauit his Sonnis life.
Than past the Knicht but baid unto the haw,
Persauit the blude, and als the Creddill saw.
He liftit up the Creddill as it stude,
Fand the barn haill, and als mekill spilt blude
Persauand sine of the Serpent the heid,
The skin and taill, that had fochin to deid.
And fand his Sone withouttin wan or wound
Allace he said for my good gay grew hound.
That I have slane withouttin any cause,
Bot only for the void vane wordis and sawis.
Of ane woman, that hes talkit in vane
Quhairthrow I have, but cause my Grewhou^d
Quhilk I persaue hes sauit my sonnis life slane
Fra the Serpent, throw his debait and strife.
Woe to the hour that now I drew my sword,
Woe to the hour that hard my wifis word.
Woe to the hand that suddand straik that gave,
To my best hound that my so(...)s life did save
Quhilk I lude best, without any compair,
Saifing my wife, my only Sone and Air.
Quhilk at this time hes sauit fra the deid,
And for rewaird, now he hes loist his heid.
But dout I wald have geuin a thousand pound
Of good money, or I had slane my hound.
Bot sen sa is I se is na remeid.
My Sone is saif, and my good hound is deid,
That faucht for him, and only sauit his life,
And I him slew throw ane word of my wife,
Bot fra thine forth heir I solemn ane vow.
That Jik man sall gif credence to and trow.
Heir I forsaik all Tornay and Justing,
Heir I forsaik all Halking and Hunting.
Heir I forsaik rynning with scheild and speir,
Heir I forsaik all faitis of men of weir,
In Cristindome bot it not manlynes,
Heir I forsaik all armor and harnes.
For I will pas now to the Halie land,
And fecht with Jowis, quhill I may strike or stand
Contrair Gods fais and thairto end my life
This vowit yis knicht for ane word of his wife
That unto her gave sic haistie credence,
Withouttin cause or it Experience.
Thairfoir my Lord our good Grace I require,
Gif not sa sone credence to the desire
Of our Empress, thocht scho be diligent.
Aganis our Sone greit lesingis to Invent.
For e may weill be this same Tale persaue
Quhat the knicht gat that sa sone credence gave
Unto his wife, and to her wordis vane,
That sauit his Sone yt same hound hes he slane
Thairfoir good Schir, and pleis our nobill grace
I wald e gave na credence in this case
Unto our Queen, to put our Sone to deid,
For e will rue quhen their is na remeid.
As did this knicht, his Nobill hound that slew
Remeid bypast, than he began to rue.
My Lord he said, have e betane this Taill.
The Empreour said, that I have done but faill
For that good Taill that e have tauld to me,
As for this day, my Sone he sall not die.
The Doctor said gif that e do sir thing
Ze do wisely, and like ane Nobill king.
Thankand our Grace, that only for my saik
Zour Sonnis deid, only e have done slaik.
And sa tuke leif at the good Empreour
To his marrowis past hame with all plesour.
MORALITAS.
THIS Tale us tellis, quha list thairto tak tent
That Nuresis should not be negligent
To keip their Babis quha can not keip their sell
Fra fire, watter, and all siclyke perrell.
That may happin to any Innocent.
For in to treuth my self this matter saw.
In Edinburgh town west underneath the waw
Thairfoir mair sure the matter e sall trow.
That ane Infant was swellyit with ane sow.
The guttis raif forth, both lung Lever and gaw.
The Mother left the oung ane on the flure
In blankets sit, quhilk barn her awin self bure,
Past her way forth, and or scbo come agane
The gredie sow had this oung Babie slane.
This my self saw, I may say it mair sure.
Thothe I not saw this other I hard tell
How ane woman past forth bot to the well.
And left her Bab, in the Creddill sleipand
Or scho returnit, the house was all byrnand.
And the oung Bab, deuorit with fire sa fell.
Money mischeifis and also greit offencs
Des often occurrit be Nureis negligence,
That their Babeis leifis in the house alane
Quhilk is the cause of money barnis vane.
As is often seen be good Experience.
Thairfoir Mothers and Nuresis I protest
Quhen that e put out oung Babeis to rest
Leif not the house alane all desolait
Quhat may be chance often times richt small e wait
To cshew danger do e the liklyest,
Als in this Tale I find ane other thing.
How the Serpent lay in the hoill lurking
Wait and quhill that the house was at quiet
Money seruand is now preuilie play is the Diet
Much taking out, and small good will inbring.
Their to Serpentis richt weill I may compair
Fra their Maisteris ay takand lait and air
As Beif, Bacon, malt, meill both claith and coilis.
Takand ay out, and hydand into hoils.
Their ar Serpents I say to ow but mair.
As to this knicht, quhilk his good hound hes slane
That sauit his Sone fra all perrell and pane
Ze may persaue be good Experience
It is not good to gif haistie credence
To wyfis wordis, that are both falls and vane.
Unto the time they had perfytelie seen
How the haill cause and matter it had been.
Quhen they had ^^nawin the utter verity
Than had been time the Dog to have gart die,
Also the Nureis na way I can make clean,
Sine throw the word of ane vane wickit wife,
Quhilk often is cause of mekill sturt and strife.
Causit him to do the thing he did sair rue
Because the treuth that time clean he misknew.
And gart him reif fra his good hound the life.
Quhilk Instantly for suik rynning of speir,
All merynes, and honest fait is of weir,
All vaileant acts of Justing and Tornay

Ze Maryit men tak heir Experience,
And siclyke als perfyte Intelligence
Fra haistie word is of our wyfis to eschow
For they will say, and gar ow traistlie trow

O wickit wicht, thou dois all that thou can

Quben may he makis him self for to distroy

To pray to him doutles thou had greit neid.

Now beit thairto that e gif great credence,
To set it forth e make richt small defense.

Now with ane Bair and Scheiphird it befell.
UPON a time their was ane Empreour
Of greit wisdom, greit puissauce and honor
Ane fair Forest he had plesand to se
Both gay and trim, with money semelietre.
Quhairin their was rinning ane grit wild bait
Both day and nicht he maid thairin repair.
All kind of folk that this Bair micht ouirta.
Without merci^ he did douoir and sla.
Sa that nane durst out throw the Forest pas,
For dout of deid, the way sa perrellous was.
Quhairof the King was heuie in his mind,
That his pepill was slane on siclike kind.
With ane dum beist deuorit to the deid,
And be na way thairof culd get remeid.
In his Impyre, ane cry he gart proclaim,
On his behalf, Authority and Name.
Quha wald debait or bauldlie tak on hand
With that brym bair in battle for to stand,
And him vincus be strenth of stalwart straik,
His aue douchter he should have to his maik,
After his deid, his Realm as he war Air,
This he should have, quha ever slew the Bair.
This was proclamit throw his Kinrik and la^d
Bot nane was found, the deid wald tak on hand
Ercept ane Hird that in him felf ^uke he^d
Micht I this Bair quod he bring to the deid.
Not o^lie I, bot all my k^^ also
Should throw that deid bruik ever waldlie Jo.
And ever mair in estimatioun be.
Sa I had hap to gar that dum beist die.
Quhilk I sall do or else to lois my life,
Se I that Bair, we salb* at the strife.
And sa he tuke his Scheiphirdis staf in hand.
Past to the wod, quhair he the Bair sone fand.
^e may persaue how sone the Bair him saw,
Without delay toward the Hird did draw,
With sic ane faird and als ane felloun feir.
The silli^ Hird durst never cum him neir
To save his life, to se gif he had hap,
But mair debait up in ane tree he lap.
Incontinent quhen that the Bair sa saw
The tree to bite began and als to gnaw,

That the tree crop he should gar turn dounwart,
Bot it the hird bethocbt him on ane wile,
Now that he should this brim bauld bair begile.

Of Nobill fruit, quhilk ay the hird did pow
Quhilk he kest down ay to the Bair to cit,
Quhairof the Bair was blyith that he gat meit
And fillit him so that he list weill to sleip,
The hird that saw, and down the tree did creip.
Be that ane arm he hang into the tree.
With that other the Bair richt quyetlie
Upon the womb richt softli^ can he claw,
The Bair sleiping persauit w^ill he saw.
At the tree rute, the Bair quhair that he lay
With his Braig knife his throt ^uttit in ^way.
Sine brocht his heid unto the Empreour
With all blyithnes, triumph and greit honor,
Saying good Schir, and pleis our nobil grace
Zour greit w^ld bair I have him killit throw race
Not douting bot, our cry e will fulfill,

Quhat ever he was, that wald kill our wild Bair

Quhen all our Court refusit the same to do
With ane stout heart I set my mind thairto.
And now on case the same man chancit am I
And I desire our Grace fulfill our cry*
The Empreour said, all that I causit proclaim
Compleit I not, it is to my defame.

For euin with this scheiphird stude, outher to do or else to die
He was sa stont and sture, of his life tuke na cure,
Thairfoir wald thou estemitit be, set all on adventure,
And for to purches honesty.
To dignity wald thou the dres, and conqueis the honor
Thou should not sleip in Idilnes, nor tak all thy plesour
Set all on ser and seuin and perchance cast eleum
With prayer sa and good laubour, a man may co^queis beuin
Denu^ing the of all rankour.
Ane reproach to the Empri^e.
THE crukit compansouns of our wild Bair
Will win ow na warisounis, to ow I declair
Of hell thou art the snair, plutois playfule in plane
In hell than hald the their, and cum not heir agane
Bot still their ay remane, to be houng be the hals
Into perpetual pane, because thou art sa falls.
THE morrow come, and but mair auisement
The Empreour set him self in Judgment.
Condampnit his Sone on Gallous for to die,
Without respect, that alkin man micht se.
He being led out throw the streit and town
With greit regrait, and sair lamentatioun.
The nixt Master come than the way ridand,
And saw the Child to the Gallous gangand.
Quhairat he was both sad and sorrowfow,
Bot it the Child to his Master did bow,
Inclynit his heid, as he wald said him to,
Master make speid, e ken quhat is ado.
The Master than prickit sa in that stour,
Quhill he lichtit befoir the Empreour,
With reverence, as weill culd him effeir,
And at his Grace richt humbly culd he speir.
O my good Lord quha geuis ow this counsel
Withouttin cause our awin sone down to quell
It is our wife that siclike garris ow do?
Perchance e sall upon war hap cum to.
Tha^ cha^cit ane knicht yat throw his wifis falls
Was put to schame, without querrel or cause saw is
Than said the King, good master I require ow
Schaw me that Tale and blyithlie I sal heir ow
My Lord he sayis, will e gar call agane
Zour only Sone, quha is to suffer pane,
I sall ow tell my Tale forth to the end.
And sa the King agane for him did send.
Put him in waird quhair that he was beforne,
Quhill that the Tale was done and til y^ morn
Sa the Master the secund Tale began
Befoir the King, and money Nobill man.
As e sall heir, thairfoir gif audience,
But mair delay, and to our reverence.
The Tale of the secund Master.
IN ane Cietie their was ane Ancient Knicht
That had maryit ane Lady fair and bricht.
As e have ane, my Lord to our plesour
And held her up in all eis and honor.
Lufit her sa weill, above all eirdly thing,
Sir as e do our Queen my Souerane King.
He lude her sa, he culd not eit nor drink
But her presence, sa on her ay did think.
And als at euin quhen all folk to bed past,
The ettis and dures siclike he lokkit fast,
And all the keyis under his heid they lay,
Euerilk nicht quhill morn that it was day.
And at ilk morn quhen he thocht time to rise,
Oppinnit the dures him self as was the gise.
In that Cietie was ane custom and Law,
Cryit oppinlie that Ilk persoun micht know.
At ane set hour ane Bell was roung at nicht,
That all micht heir, and understand full richt,
And thairefter withouttin mair delay
The watch was set to walk quhill it was day.
Sine after that, gif they culd any meit
Gangand allone, or walkand on the streit.
Sone they war taken, and unto presound led,
Quhill on the morue that all men raise fra bed,
They war fast bound to ane stock or ane tree,
To their greit schame, that all the town micht se
Sine after that, Enduring their lifetime
They war repute as guilty of ane crime,
And haldin forth fra all good company,
This was the Law that time of this Cietie.
This foirsaid Knicht quhairof I spak of air,
Was growin in age, ane auld man and ane hair
His rampand rage of outh he had compleit,
And had slokinnit of bedsolace the sweit.
How beit he lude his Lady weill aneuch.
Zit as e ken, mair graith ^pertenis the pleuch.
And scho persauit of sic craft he did faill
Scho tuke in heid ane other to assaill,
And sa scho did, ane man of tender age
In lust is bour for to win vassalage.
Quha had ane quyer Chalmer in the town.
Sa every nicht after this Knicht lay down,
Under his heid the key scho staill away,
To her oung lufe scho went quhair that he lay
And sa scho did, als often as ever scho list,
Tuke forth the keyis that her husband not wist
And quhen scho come fra her tryst and her trane,
Scho laid the keyis under his heid agane.
So it befell upon ane winter nicht
Ane walking come upon this Elderin Knicht
He culd not sleip, it walking as he lay,
He turnit about and mist his wife away,
Upon her Name he cryit ofter nor thrice,
Scho answerit not, than he begouth to rise,
Socht all the house be na way culd her find.
And wist not weill gif scho was out or in.
Socht his bed heid quhair that the keyis lay,
Quhat wald e mair they war all taken away.
Past to the ettis, all oppin he them fand,
But mair auise he closit them fra hand.
In ane windo that oppinnit up to the gait
Mekill of the nicht their sat he at the wait,
And quhen it was about the third Cok craw
Makand her hame, his awin wife he saw,
Quha fand the ettis upon her lokkit fast,
Ze may weill wit that scho was than aghast.
Never the les because the ettis was lokkit,
For to win in peirtlie thairat scho knokkit.
Than said the Knicht, O thou woman unclean
Thinkis thou honor on streit now to be seen?
O wickit wife, and woeful waryit wicht,
Quhy hes thou now dissauit thy awin Knicht
Of quhom thou knew all hail thou had y^ heart
Of thy bawdrie now I am weill expart.
For this is not the first time thou hes done
Sic harlatrie, thou sall rue be one Moan.
Quhill the watch cum their still e sall remane
And as Law will, thairefter thoill the pane.
Than said the wife, my Lord quth^ say e sa,
Quhair I was now their was witness far ma.
My Motheris Mand scho come and fetchit me,
Quhilk lyis richt seik, and is in point to die.
And than because I saw ow weill on rest,
To wakin ow I thocht it not the best.
That gart me steill the keyis fra ow away,
I thocht pity to walkin ow as e lay.
For quhy e ken e ar febill and auld
To walkin ow of our first sleip e wald
Been seik the morn and wonder Ill disposit,
Thairfoir craib not, that our ettis was vnclosit
And my Mother als is sa wonder seik,
Ane word to me, skarslie scho had to speik.
Anoyntit ellis, and maid her latter will
And now my self hes haist it me ow till.
Thairfoir good Lord I pray ow hartflulie
Tak na suspect, nor think na fault in me.
For I had never sic thing in my thocht
Sen the first time to our bed I was brocht,
Nor never had sic thing into my heart
Nor never sall, quhill deid us two depart.
Thairfoir I pray, e let me not be taken
With the tou^ watch, heir standing mine alane
For now the hour approches wonder neir.
That the watch rise, and they will find me heir,
Quhilk is to me ane everlasting schame,
And als to ow it is ane greit defame.
War I gnltie or it committit crime.
I wald witschaif e held me out this time.
Than said the Knicht doutles e cum not in,
For na prayer of ow nor all our kin.
Qahill that the watch betak ow in the snair,
Than quhair e war, to them e mon declair.
Than the wife said my Lord gif sa e do
In greit defame of us both it cummis to,
And all our kin Alpa and our freindis,
And all other that ather of us pertenis.
Gif I he heir now with the town watch found
I rather gif ane hundredth thousand pound.
Quod he Ill wife, and woman far defamit.
Thou hes sa done, yat thy self thou hes schamit
Far better war for thn fait puneist be,
And heir thaill schame, that all mankind may se
Nor for to thoill punischment after deid,
In birnand hell, quhair their is na remeid.
Than said the wife my Lord I ow require,
In this ane point to fulfill my desire.
Now for his saik that deit upon the tree,
Thoill not sic schame sa saikles cum to me.
The Knicht answerit unto his wife agane.
Ill wiekit wife, thy wordis ar all in vane.
Thou cu^mis not in unto the watches know,
And be puneist after the course of Law.
Than said the wife I persaue this is done
All for Juuy, and e ar Inoportune.
Than sen sa is e ar Impatient,
I will ow schaw in few wordis my Intent.
My Lord e know at this et standis ane well
Quhairin but dout now I sall drown my sell.
Rather nor I and all mp kin be schamit,
And als our self sall not chaip vndefamit.
Tha^ said the Knicht wald God yat sic had been
Lang time befoir I saw ow with mine Ene.
Sa as their two togidder was at talk
The Moon worcester dark and hid was under walk
Than said the wife, my Lord and be our will,
That I heir bide, the same I mon fulfill.
Or I bide heir and for to schame my sell
Rather I sall be drownit in this well.
Bot I will do as ane good Cristin wicht,
Aucht to her Lord, and to ane Nobill Knicht.
Zit or I die my mind is and Intent
Befoir ow heir to make my Testament.
Heir to the Lord first I bequyth my Saull,
My banis to ly in the Kirk of Sanct Paull,
As for my gudes, had I ten thousand pound.
Ten thousand ky gangand upon the ground.
Als money Plewis gangand upon the land,
Als money scheip as thairvpon micht stand.
I wald leif all unto our awin persoun,
Them to dispone at our awin diseretioun.
And gif e pleis any thing for to deill
Into Almus, for my weill and Saull heill,
That I refer to our awin wit and will,
Quhat ever e pleis, the same for to fulfill.
For weill I wait e will do botthe richt,
I say na mair my sweit husband gudnicht.
As scbo that said, in her arms culd scho tak
Ane mekill stane, and in the well did swak.
That being done, scho come richt preuilie
To the et cheik, and stude their quictlie.
The Knicht heiring the stane fall in the well,
Beleuit weill it was the Lady sell.
And said allace my wife is drownit but dout,
Sa in ane fray the Knicht come rinnand out,
And to the well he sped him but mair baid,
The wife that saw, in at the et scho slaid,
And closit the et richt wander sure and fast,
To the windo in haist scho culd her cast.
In the mean time the Knicht stude at the well,
Murning richt sair and saying to him sell.
Woe be the hour that ever I was borne,
My lufit wife allace is now forlorn.
Woe be the hour that ever I closit my et,
Woe be the hour in my windo I set
To spy my wife, quhilk I wait was saikles,
I am the wite now of her deid doutles.
Allace allace now is their na remeid
Throw wilfulnes of us both scho is deid.
The Lady hard, in windo quhair scho lay,
And to the Knicht with sturdit wordis culd say
O e auld fule that should be callit ane Knicht.
Quhat do e their standing this time of nicht,
Out of our bed walking sa wonder lait,
Waitting our hures and harlotis on the gait.
Micht it not serve my body at our will,
Bot e wald pas our auld huredome until.
This is nichtlie e use the same passage,
Ze sall repent richt sair our auld fulage.
The Knicht kuawing the voce of his awin wife
He was richt blyith that scho was it on life.
Saying Lady weill is me ever mair,
Loving to God that I may heir ow their.
For I beleuit e had been in the well,
Quod scho auld fule keip the out of it thy sell.
Thou seruis better for to have punischement,
For thy baudrie, nor halie gaitis to went.
Quod he Lady lat e sic langage be,
Quhat is the cause e say sic thing to me?
Quhen I lockit the et e sall me trow
I did nathing bot to have chaissit ow.
For in na wise I never did Intend
Zow to displeis, or any way offend.
For quhen I hard the noyis into the well,
Unto my heart their straik ane cruel knell,
And in all haist e saw as I come down
Zow to preserve, that na wayis e fuld droun.
Auld dosinnit Carll (quod scho) I heir the lie,
Thou was ouir peirt to Judge sit thing to me.
Bot I persaue this Proverb is richt true,
The Iniust often the Innocent dois persew.
Thou leis to me, and hes done money time,
Ever the gilt quhen thou committis the crime,
As thou dois now, that never to the faillit.
Bot thy greit slicht as now I have assaillit,
And hes the taken into the sicker snair,
Quhairfoir but dout for me thou sall stand yair
Quhill watches cum and with them to be sens
In times bygane ane auld fule thou hes been,
That me lichtlyit, thy awin wife and disprsit,
And to thy hures eid often times disagisit.
And ever hes done, sen first time I the kend,
All thy lifetime in lownrie thou hes spend.
Bot God will not lat sit vnpuneist be,
For money fault thou hes done often to me.
For he is Just, and will have sit thing schawin
And I sall make it unto the pepill knawin.
Thairfoir stand still, thou cu^mis not in but dout
Quhill the watches and al Nichtbouris about
Quhat ane thou art, they may perfytelie know
And thairefter to bide the straik of Law.
Than said the knicht, Lady I have meruell
To ^uhat effect should e sit to me tell.
Ze know richt weill that I am auld and hair,
And in this town I have been ever mair,
And weill I wait* quhair my name was proclamit
Unto this hour for na taus was defamit.
Thairfoir Lady for the good Lordis Name
Thoill me cum in, and let me not tak schame.
Scho said ald fule thou spe^ds thy speich in vane
Their sall thou stand, and thoil of law ye pane
Better it is to thoill heir patiently,
Nor ever mai^ in hell condampnit be.
Solomon sayis three things that God dois hait
Ane pure proud man abone his awin estait.
Sine ane rich man in consuctude to lie,
And ane auld man ane fond fule for to be.
And sa but dout e bruck their vices three,
Quhat neid had e sa far to lie on me.
As for riches e have riches at will
Quhy should e than our speiche with falset spill,
As for ane Fule, e ar ane wonder touth,
For as e ken the flour of all my outh,
At our pleasure e have had ever mair,
Zit to baudrie e eid both lait and air
Thairfoir God hes done wonder weill ^ow till
Thocht e contrair both his command and will
Hes perseuerit still in our harlatrie,
Zit he will not thaufoir e perischit be,
Bot leut ow grace our sinnis heir repent
Thairfoir e mon bide Law and Judgment.
Than said the knicht my Lady best belufit,
Howbeit God be contrair ane sinner mufit,
Zit not the les as all sinnaris should trow,
God of his grace is to us mercyfow.
Quhat time we will forbeir and als repent,
Than God forgeuis our sins Incontinent.
Thairfoir Lady sen sic grace God us sendis
Now let me in, and I sail make ane mendis.
Than said the wife with voice stout and austeir
Hence the harlot, quhair deill gar we this Freir
Talk quhat thou pleis, bot trewlie you sall trow
Thou cummis not in, and heir I make ane vow
And as they spak their wordis them amang,
In the mean time the watches bell they rang.
Than said the knicht, good wife let ly sic things
Heir e not now how that the watch bell rings
Suffer me not for ever to tak schame,
Quhilk is forsooth degrading of my Name.
Quod scho e wait not quhat one ringing menis
To the weilfair of our saull it pertenis.
Thairfoir e man tak all forth pacientlie
For our penance e mon thoill opinlie
Ane trespassour but dout lang have e been
To GOD and me, as fall be hard and seen.
In the mean time their twasum as they talkit.
Up throw the streit the watches come yt walkit.
Sone into handis they tuik this Nobil knicht
With greit meruell how he into the nicht
Upon the streit durst forth of ludgeing be,
They to him said it was na knichts dewtie:
Considering weill the dout of Law he kend,
He was to bauld the contrair to pretend.
Scho heiring this with a loud voice scho cryit
O my good friends, the treuth now e have spyit
Of that Truikour, and als ane dotit Fule,
That his foul lust on na wayis he culd cule.
Bot upon hures forth passing on the nicht,
Pans e gif sic pertenis to ane auld knicht.
That my body at plesour had all time,
Considre now gif he committit crime:
Wit^ hures all nicht, and (...)g in at morn
Bot of sit faulus I have him often forborne.
Believing ay sit faultis he should have mendit,
Bot e may se gif he hes now offendit.
Thairfoir gif e of sic hes correctioi^,
Conform to Law ^ pun^is his persoure
That sit auld deuili^s as he sa lang hes bent
Tak ^rampili of him befoir their en^.
For he hes been to me ane gr^^t tratour,

Than the warches ^uik him Incontinent
To deiy presoun with him in (...) they went.
Quhill day was sicht, and (...) the Sour ^rais,
With him the watch unto the (...) ga^s,
Schawing to him the fassoun to the end,
How on the ^cht they did him comprehend:
And how to them his wife sit plaintis maid,

The Dortour then said hu(...) the ^ing,
And pleis our grace e have Understanding
Quhat I have said, th^^preour said rich weill

The Ma^ster said it sall worse happin ow
Nor chacit this knicht for treuth yis e sal trow
Gif that e do for the wordis of our wife.
^ut down our sone, and reif fra him his life.
The Empreour said that wise was far to blame
That her husband put to sic oppinschame,
And he sa^kles the foull Ill her betide.
Scho was the worst, that it did gang or ride.
And for that Tale that thou hes tauld to me,
This day but dout my Sone he sall not die.
The Master said my Lord e doing so
Within few da^s batth pleasure and greit Jo
Of our ane Sone e sall have Schir but faill.

THE Empress hard how all the matter eid
And how the Child was not it put to deid
For very sturt in her mind was richt woe
It was may like her heart to brist in two.
To her Chalmer than scho past sone within,
And their began to skart and rife her skin.
And cryit aloude that ever I was borne,
Into my Cude, sen I had been forlorn.
I being Child to ane sa greit a King,
That I should thoill, and suffer sic ane thing,
As of one Devil, and ane rank Renigald,

To my greit schame, and warldlie dishonor,
I being Queen unto the Empreour:
And can heirof get na mendis nor remeid,
I pray to God gif I war fairlie deid.
Sa this was schawin unto the Empreour,
How his Lady was (...) sic displesour.
Into all haist to her Chalmer he went,
And said Lady, I pray ow not lament,
Sa Inwardly, for it becu^mis ow nocht,
Tak not sa far nouther in mind nor thorht.
Scho said my Lord, the lufe I aw to ow
Makis me mair sturt, in heart mair sorowfow
Nor displesour of one dum Deuillis deid,

The Inwart lufe that I unto ow heir,
Sa causis me remain still with ow heir:
Or ellis I had to my Father departit,
To my country, war not I am sa harti^
To our behufe and pleasure nicht and day,
That is the cause I will not pas my way.
For gif I did than ane cause it wald be,
Of greit discord, and Inammitie:
Betuix my Father and ow for ever moir,
This is the cause I will not pas thairfoir.
For weill I wait he wald reuengr my querrell,
And to conqueis, put all this Realm in perrell.
For my father he is ane puissant Prence
Of diverse Realms, and of greit Reverence.
Wist he trewlie of my greit displesour,
I wait he wald Incres sa in rankour,
That this country for that should sair repent
That is the cause fra him I me absent,
For our plesour, and it e will not trow.
That I wald do sic pleasure unto ow.
The Empreour said Madame be weil Inclind
Lat sic malice remove out of our mind,
For sa lang time as God will len me life,
I think never to faill to ow my wife.
My Lord said scho, I pray God e leif lang,
Howbeit that I thus leif in threip and thrang.
Bot I dreid sair and heuilie I feir,
That it chance ow that cha^cit this hinder eir
Of ane greit Knicht and of his Sone alone,
After the time that his Father was gone,
Throw suddand chance departit to the deid
Zit his awin Sone wald not bury his heid.
The Empreour said, that was ane felloun feid
The Son^ wald not bury the Fatheris heid.
That exempill I pray ow to me schaw
Scho said my Lord will e tak tent and know
It sall do ow greit good I tak on hand,
Quod he schaw forth, and let me understand.
Sa scho began with all erpeditioun,
As scho best culd to say forth her Sermon.
IN this Cietie that now is callit Rome,
Quhilk in pai dapis was heid of cristindome
Their dwelt ane Knicht, the suith ow for to say
Had bot ane Sone, and he had Douchters twap
This Knicht was geuin to Halking and Hunting
Greit Tornamentis, and to swift horse rinning.
To merynes and all kind of plesour,
That micht hald up and forth set his honor.
Sa every eir sa greit riches he spent,
Quhilk thrice ouircome his Rentall and his rent
Quhairthrow than grew to him skant of riches
His daily cheir, and expens did decres.
In that mean time their was ane Emprour
Octauiane. ane man of greit honor,
Quhilk in riches, sa richly did abound,
That his compair was not upon the ground.
That in so much, he had in his treasoure
Of Gold silver, the quhilk fulfild ane Tower.
Quhilk gold and Tower, thocht he it had at large
To ane greit Knicht to keip he gave in charge.
This other Knicht quhome of we spak of air,
That had spendit his rent and mekill mair.
On Idill gammes, as Hunting and Halking.
Lait sitting up, and out of time spending.
To sic pureteth, he grew and greit thirlage,
That he behuid to sell his heritage.
He callit to him his Sone quhilk was his Air,
And all the case to him he culd declair.
This is the case, but dout my Sone said he,
I am compeld, sa with greit poverty,
That I on force, and neid mon sell my land,
Except remeid cum at sum other hand,
Quhairthrow I may, Enduring my life dayis
Leif honestly, this to his Sone he sayis.
For gif I chance to sell my heritage
Ze ken my douchters will want good Marriage
He said Father, gif sa it with ow standis
That e on neid, analie mon our landis,
At our pleasure, quhairof I am content
Do as e pleis, for thairto I consent.
The Father said, now I have taken in thocht,
Ane good consait, and tell it will I nocht
Bot unto the, I know the Empreoure
Of Gold and rent he hes fulfillit ane Tower.
Let us two pas, with Instrumentis be nicht,
And brek the Tower with sutteltie and slicht.
We sall obtene riches abundantly,
Sall us vphald ever in honesty,
Than said the Sone schortlie to make ane end,
Their is na man that counsall can amend.
It is better tak fra the Empreour
Part of his Gold, his Silver and treasour.
Than e to sell our land and heritage,
Quhairthrow our barnis, sal leif ay in thirlage
Sa in ane voce their two did condescend
To brek this Tower but tarry they Intend,
Sa on ane nicht with Instrumentis they past
And throw the Tower ane hole they gat at last
Wan to the Gold, at larges quhair it lay,
Furneist them sekkis, and vnscryit come away
Payit all his dettis, and leifit als merylie
As of befoir, in alkin game and glie.
In Halking Hunting and in Tornament,
Quhil at the last the Gold was gane and spent.
In the mean time, the keipar of the Tower
Quhilk had in charge all this Gold and treasour
Persauit the hole, and the Gold stollin away,
He was sorry, and wist not quhat to say.
Into all haist past to the Empreour,
And schew how theifis had stollin his greit trea sour
The Empreour said, in Ire all angerlie
Quhat is y^ cause thou schawis sic thing to me?
To the I gave, as to ane true seruand
My Gold to keip, and that thou tuke on hand
At the agane I ask it to restoir,
As it becu^mis, thou sall thoill panis thairfoir.
Quhen that this Knicht the Empreour sa hard say
He said na mair bot humbly come his way,
And saw their was na matter to debait,
He vmbethocht him self of ane consait,
Thinkand richt weill that they wald cu^ agane
To seik mair gold, to taint yame with ane trane
Befoir the hole ane Ewn he gart prepair,
Middillit with pick birdlime and siclike wair.
Sa thick and teuch, that quha thairin cu^ wald
Contrair tha^r will, yair still it wald yame hald
And nane micht cum into that hole agane,
Bot he most neidis fall in that samin trane.
Not lang after as I befoir have said,
This other Knicht, quhen the Gold spendit had
He and his Sone agane went to the Tower,
To steill mair Gold than fra the Empreoure.
Sa the Father first in the hole he went,
And in the Twn he fell Incontinent.
In to the nek, and their stak as ane stane,
Considderit weill that his Fortoun was gane.
Said to his Sone cum thou fordwart no way,
For at this time, I am taken for the pray.
Cum thou fordwart thou sall not faill to die,
And nane of us ane other may supply.
Than said the Sone, gif e may not eschaip,
Than ar we both but dout taken in the raip.
God us defend Father that sa no be.
Bot at this time e get sum help of me.
And gif I nocht may help ow now my sell,
In haist I will both help and seik counsel.
The Father said I se is na remeid,
Bot with thy sword thou mon strike of my heid
And quhen they find my deid body heidles,
Than sall e all of this schame be saikles.
Sa nane sall know quhat persoun did this deid
Nor in quhais breist this bargane did inbreid.
Than said the Sone now Father be the Rude,
Zour counsall is both honest Just and good.
For gif sa chancit, in this case e war knawin,
Siclike our schame till all men should be schawin.
Sa should we not eschaip the cruel deid,
Sa I think best that I smite of our heid.
And euin with that, as he had said the word,
Out of the scheith anon he drew his sword.
His Fathers heid he hint of haistelie.
And in ane gutter he kest it neir hand by,
Quhe^ this was done tha^ past he hame his way
To his awin house unto his Sisteris tway.
Schew them the case, and all the matter haill.
Quha sair did weip priuelie and bewaill.
Sone after this the keipar of the Tower,
Quhilk had in charge the gold and the treasoure
Quhair the hole was, within the Twn he fand,
Ane heidles corpse unto the nek standand,
Quhairof he had both meruell and dredour,
In haist he past and tauld the Empreour.
Incontinent throw all the town than eid,
How their was found ane body but a heid.
Into the Twn the quhilk the knitht did set,
Quha staill the Gold, to tak him in the Net*
Than to this Knicht the empr^our said but faill
Tak the deid corpse and k^^t to ane horse taill,
And draw it throw the streitis of the Cietie,
And persa^e weill quhair any murmr be.
Any sorrow, sturt greting or murning,
Than e may weill p^^saue quhair that si^ thing
Be attayntit, quhait any persoun murnis
They ar gyltie, and wait of siclike turnis,
And is principal, of that Ilk house but dout
That staill the Gold, thairfoir seik weill about
Gifsi^ e find tak them and all their fellowis
Without mercy gar hang ^ame on yt Gallowis
The Officers without delay they went
And completit the Empreours commandment.
Quhen the Douchters the deid corpse saw cu^ by,
For Inwart woe they gave ane hiddeous cry.
For kindly lufe and Fatherly piety,
To se that corpse sa drawin throw the Cietie.
Quhen yair brother, the sone of yat deid knicht
Hard them sa murne bethocht him of ane s^^h^
Quhairfoir yt corpse throw ye Cietie was drawin
To the pepill the ^aus was richt weill knawin,
And wist na way for to eschew the ^ace,
Sa he him self sair woundit in the face.
Quhill that the blude abound autlie come out,
That the Sisters of his life had greit dout.
The officers persauit the weiping,
The noyis the cry the sturt and the greting
Into the house they enterit but delay,
And demandit quhairfoir they maid the fray.
Than said the Sone, quhen my Sisters me saw
Sa sai^ woundit, as now our self may know.
T^ay great and cr^^t, and mu^^t in their mude
And as e know, few women may se blude.
This was the ^aus of their greit lamenting
Of m^ Sisteris we know na other thing.
The Officers heirto they gave credence,
Because they gat na mair experience,
B^t went their wayis dissauit all and bl^ndit,
Cause ye richt way they culd not seik nor find it
Sine t^^k the corpse of this same heidles knich^
On the Gallous leit it hing day and nicht:
Till all pepill did wonder and meruell
Of the stollin gold quhen they the tail hard tell
And it the Sone after the Fatheris deid
Wald not bury in the Kirkaird his heid,
Nor of the treis his body wald down take
This did the Sone for his awin Fathers sake.
Ze may persaue the greit lufe and favor
To his Father he had all time and hour.
The Empress said, good schir and pleis our grace
Quhat I have said, have e weill taken the ^ace^
The Empreour said, Madame sa have I seill
Quhat e have said, I have it taken richt weill.
The declaratioun of the Empress third Taill.
THE Empress said I am richt wonder we
That of our self and our Sone it be so,
For his sonnis saik this Knicht as I have tald
Quhen he was pure his lands he left vnsald.
Quhen he wantit he had nane other schift
For his Sonnis saik than he committit thift.
And that his barnis after that he was deid
Should have na schame he causit strike of his heid
And it his Sone wald not do si^ rewaird
To bury his heid in Kirk nor it Kirk aird:
Nor he wald not nouther be nicht nor day
Down of the treis his body tak away.
In the same sort both ^^cht and day e laubou^
For to promoue our Sone to greit honor.
Bot day and ^^cht he s^^^is his Intentioun
Zow for to put to utter confusioun.
And ow destroy, is daily his desire,
That he may ring, and bruik the haill Impir^
My counsall is e rather put him down
Or he fra ow get the Impire and Croun.
The Empreour said, sa mot I thrive and the,
Ane good erampill now e have schawin to (...).
I micht have tholit after his Fathers deid.
Zit be sum slicht to cause bury his heid.
Trewlie my Sone he sall na langer ^haip,
upon the morn be hing it in ane raip.
To officers anon he gave command
To tak his Sone, and to hang him fra hand.
Down throw the streit they led him haistelie,
To the Gallous, but mercy for to die.
And as they led that oung man throw y^ streit
All the pepill began to murne and greit,
Sayand allace the Empreours only Child,
To the Gallous is led their to be filde.
Allace said they, quhat is his Fathers mind
To his ane Sone for to be sa unkind?
Now this is thryis condamp^it he hes been
And few can tell quhat dois the matter mean.
Bot all this cu^mis be the Quenis falls consait,
That he is led sa often down throw the gait.
In the mean time down ehe gait is he gone
The third Master come rydand namit Craton
And saw the Child sa wonder neir the deid,
To his Master it he Juclynit his heid,
As he wald say, Master have mind of me,
Do e not weill, their is na dome bot die.
The pepill cryit good Master haist and ride,
And for our child good help that e provide.
S(...) in all haist but any mair delay,
To the Palice he spurrit his good Palfray.
And quhen he come befoir the Empreour,
He hailsit him with reverence and honor.
Qaha maid answer to the Master again,
Thorht e be rum, our vepage is in vain:
Zour cumming heir sail nathing ow euaill
Ar e cum heir to flatter me with our taill?
The Master said within seuin eiris space
Better rewaird I have seruit at our grace:
Zit I believe to get better rewaird,
And pleis our grace that my talking be hard.
Rewaird (said he) at my hand serve e nocht,
For the dum boy to me that e have brocht.
Ze serve all seuin the very painful deid,
I^k ane of ow to Gallous for to leid:
For I delyuerit my Sone spcikand to ow
Quite du^ but syerche e seuin hes maid him now
And als he wald have defoulit my Queen,
Contrair her will, as is weill hard and seen.
The Master said, quhair e say he is dum,
Will e suffer bot ane schort time to rum
I find ow heir the michtie God to borrow
That he sall speik or the fyft day at morrow
For he that maid the dum man for to speik,
The deif to heir, to health restoir the seik,
He will restoir our Done to speik again:
Within few dayis and that I say in plame.
And quhair e say he wald deforcit our Queen,
Gifony man hes ever hard or seen
Sie conditiounis outher be lair or air
Sen he with us remanit or maid repair.
That he is gultie of all that e have said.
Than I thairfoir to die am wonder glaid.
Bot Solomon sayis richt weill in his buke,
Quha lykis thairin to reid and for to luke.
Na malice is nor was, nor it be can,
Abone malice of ane Ill geum woman.
That sall I preif be ane exampill good,
That women ar the Fontaine and the flude,
The verray rute, and special Inuentioun
Of all falset, lesings and deceptioun.
And gif e put our Sone now to the deid.
For our wifes wordis, her falset and her feid.
It sall chance ow, as it did to the man
That slew his Py throw slicht of the woman.
Quhilk Bird he lude abone all other thing,
And ay the treuth it tauld him but lesing.
The Empreour said I pray the tell me that
Betuir the man* the wife, and the Pyat.
The Master said* our Sone again gar caw,
That he thoill not the utter charge of Law.
Than sall I tell my taill to our plesour,
To our profeit, our weilfair and honor.
The Empreour said Master for this ane day
He sall not die, cum after quhat sa may.
The Master said God tha^k our grace again
Sa he his taill begouth as followis plane.
MORALITAS
WOE will continue at this place.
The Doctout is ^aill ane lytill space
And silm thing we will tell
Of the Empress comparisoun
Now scho comparit the Kingis persoun
Unto ane theif sa fell.
Scho compairit the Empreour
To the false Knicht that brak the Tower
Duheu he suid sauid his land,
For pureteth was compellit to steill.
Luik e gif scho compairit it leill
And sa weill scho it fand.
This Knitht committit tratourie
That staill sra the Authority
Outher greit thing or smaw
Quhairfoir be seruit for to bing
For quha that steillis ocht fra ane King
They may not bide the Law.
Siclyke this Knicht as was weill knawin,
Out throw the Lietie he was drawin
To his greit lack and schame
Syne bangit on the Ballow treis,
Persaue gif their two weill aggreis
To the Kingis greit defame.
And her awin Empreour comparit.
To ane pure Knicht was ail disparit,
Ane (...) ratour and ane theif.
That scho sa wald was ^^ist lyklie,
That the Empreour sasuid be,
God send her ane mischief.
As to the Knicht wald sauld his land,
And wox sa wonder pure in hand,
And alwayis superspendit:
Qnha ever spendis by their dew rent,
But faill sall after sair reyent,
Quhen he may not amend it,
Ehasrester cummis necessity,
Hounger, pureteth, and poverty,
To ste^^l that he must neidis.
Than tynes he honor and manbeid,
And thairon followis schame and deid,
Of Ili spenoing this spreidis.
Had this Knicht spendit with measure.
According to his awm treasour.
after his faculty.
He suid not neid to brek ane Tower
Nor stollm gold fra the Empreour
Nor pure neidit not be.
Bude Schirs that hes rent and riches,
Be not in spending sa rekies.
Bot with ressou (...) ticht:
For than on force e mon seli land.
Or ellis tak sum eueill deid on hand
As did this heidit Knicht.
Quha chaipit anis and past again
Still ay in stouth for to remain.
Quhilk all man should forbeir.
It may chance anis a man to siu
Bot he suid na way ly thairin.
Nor still to perseueir.
For as that ane Knicht fand a wyle
That other Linicht for to begyle
And tak h^n in the net.
Euin sa the Feind ^s fyndand ay
Sum new gait to fang in his pray
Quhilks ay to sin ar set.
The birdlyme is to hald them still:
And ay in pleasure tak their will,
For as the gold was sweit.
That causit this Knicht to ruin again
That is in sinay to remain.
Quhill they ald up the Spreit.
Than art thou sicker in the snair.
Quhen deid cummis thou dow do na mair
Bot to the Galious led.
That is to hell without remeid,
Than all thy gold that was sa reid
It standi^ the in na steid.
Tha^rfoir quha wald leaf in honor
Se they their geir spend with measour
Be not ouir Liberal.
Spend not in Prodigality,
Bot as affeiris thy Faculty
Or doutles want thou sall.
Sum time may chance a mau spend may
Upon ane day, nor be may spair
To spend in vthet nine
I grant. bot it e should considder
Put spairing dayis and them togidder
And sa small sall e tyne.
Of spending is three kind of branches,
The first to spend he never stanches,
Salang as he hes heill,
Bot ever spendand in ane rane,
Quhill all that he hes is quyte gane,
On force this man mon steill,
The secund spendis with greit honor,
with houestie and greit measour
Nouther mekill nor skant,
Bot sum time spairis and sum time speudis
And gydis weill that God him sendis,
Sa this man can not want.
The third he is sa greit negart.
To speud hes nonther band nor heart,
And ay sayis he hes nocht.
Ever spairand and ever wantis,
And to have geir he never grantis
For all that ever he wrocht.
Of their three let us tak the middis,
The wise man that expreslie biddis
Thairfoir I ow bescik,
This is na honest man to grief,
Bot se that e put not our s^e^f
Farther nor hand may reik.
Ane reproach or reprufe to the Empress.
COrruptit cors unclean. thou spring and well of vice,
Thou fikkill feindis Queen, thou perrellous Ill Empress,
Thou cruel Cocatrice. and kyndlie Cocadrill
For all thy taillis nice, thou sall not get thy will
Falls gyglot gangland gill, thou poysonit spewand spout,
Thy banis brint on ane hill, I think to se but dout.
The Tale of the third Master, of the Burges Pyat.
UPON a time their dwelt in ane Cietie,
Ane Nobill man and a Burges was he:
That had ane bird weill fed up in a Cage,
Quhilk we a Py do call in out langage.
This bird scho was sa weill leirnit to speik.
That scho culd talk Latin Hebrew and Greik
And quhen seho had their langages perfect,
Her Master tuik of her ane greit delight.
Sa be process na thing scho hard nor saw
To her Master Incontinent wald schaw.
This Burges man he had ane wife richt fair,
As now e have, wantoun and debonair.
Quhilk ouir all thing he lufit all the best,
Bot be contrair, her lufe sa was not dressed.
Because it passit far fra the Burges micht
Her appetite to compleis day and nicht:
As scho desirit. at her pleasure to half,
Quhat wald scho tha^ bot cheisit ane other knaif
With her to play as scho thocht may plesour,
Quhome scho best lude and held him in favor.
And sa behude her husband on ane day
To other tounis in veyage make Jornay,
For Merchandice to ^y and for to sell,
For Merchand men at hame an may not dwell
Bot in this world to wander, wirk and win,
Quhill of this life that they depart and twin.
Bot it this wife had not sic thing in mind
To her pleasure her thocht was all Inclynd.
Sa quhen her spous forth of the town was went
Without tacy than for her lufe scho sent.
That they micht make good their and mirrines
As the good wife thocht best scho culd adres.
And sa they did at their awin appetyte,
Quhen (...)faris meitis of vthers takis delight.
This saw the Py, on her Pirk quhair scho sat,
Quhat mirrines that her husie was at.
And to her Master tauld quhen he come hame
And causit her husie to get outrage and blame.
Sa them betuir raise up ane bargane stout,
Quhill money of their nichtbouris hard about.
The good wife said, now weill Schir I persaue
Quhat greit favor and lufe to me e have.
And said e gifmair traist unto our Py
Nor unto me, and mair her sittis by.
Bot sa lang as our Pyat is on life
It sall not faill bot we sall be at strife.
The Burges said, my Pyat can not lie,
All that scho seis the treuth scho will tell me.
For scho can not be na way nor Ingme,
Any lesing into her heart deume.
And thairfoir I have mair cause for to trow
All that scho sayis far better than craist ow.
Sa day and nicht continually they chide,
Quhill on a day the Burges buskit to ride.
In far countries to do his Merchandice,
As it effeiris sic men, and is the gise.
Bot als sa sone as he his wayis went,
For her luifar scho send Incontment.
To make her blyith, greit solace and good their,
Bot on the day he durst never cum neir.
For greit sclander of pepill and commoun vois,
All the lang day quhill nicht he held him clois.
As the nicht come, he knokit at the gin.
Scho was reddy thairat, and leit him in.
Scho said e ar richt welcum unto me,
^e may cum in, for na man will ow se.
He said my lufe, our Pyat sair I feir,
For scho will tell all scho can se or heir.
For scho raisit sic taillis betuix us ellis
That all the town to other plainly tellis.
Scho said feir not, bot bauldlie enter in
On me I tak both perrell and the sin.
Sa he enterit and tuik na mair in thocht,
And be the hand throw the hall scho him broche
And as their two throw the hall maid passage
The silly Py quhair scho sat in her Cage,
To her husie scho hard her luifar say
We sall be blyith and make mirrie quhill day,
For e ar scho that I lufe all the best,
Bot I feir sair the Pyat us molest.
Quod scho feir not, I bid not for to lie ow
It is sa mirk the Pyat will not se ow.
Than said the Py, how beit I may not se,
I heir thy voice, for richt weill ken I the.
To my Master thou dois ane greit I niure,
For of his wife thou makis a commoun hure.
And his best bed quhilk he beleuis is clean:
Thou defuileis, quhilk is weill kend and seen
Quhilk my master quhe^ he cu^is hame sal know
And the true treuth swyithlie I sall him schaw
Than said her lufe, my heart tauld I ow not
That we wald both be spyit be the Pyot.
And tell the treuth of both scho hard and saw,
And every word make her Master to know.
Tak e na feir thairof than said the wife,
Lone talking sall perchance coist her the life.
And this same nicht I sall reuengeit be
Upon the Py, as e sall heir and se.
Sa they to bed past both withouttin feir,
Bot quhat become the Pyat e sall heir.
About midnicht up this good wife scho raise,
Cryit on her Maid, and put on both their clais,
Incontinent ane lang ledder they gat,
And to the rufe of the house they it sat.
And tyruit the house abone the Pyats Cage,
Quhair y^ fireflauchts and rain micht get passage
Blenks of Candill about the Pyats heid,
May like fireflauchts with cauld water yair eid
Small stanis like peis upon her heid they kest,
May like hailstanis, sa this pure Py was dressed
Sa all this nicht without any remeid
Was this Py pynit, almaist unto the deid.
Sa on the morn away the oung man staw
At ane bak dure, quhair nane him hard nor saw
Sa this Burges come hame within few dapis
And to his Py first he gais to and sayis,
O my best bird, now tell me of thy cheir,
How hes thou fairne sen I departit heir?
My bird (said he) quhat hes thou seen or hard?
Tell me the treuth for thy gudlie rewaird.
Master (scho said) I sall ow trewlie tell,
Quhat that I hard, I saw and quhat befell.
Ze war not past of this town day and nicht.
Quhe^ that our wife did to ow greit vnricht.
Ane other man into our bed scho laid
And all that nicht togidder they two played.
And I them schew y^ they war both to blame,
That I should tell to ow quhen e come hame.
Master but dout this is ane treuthfull taill,
Zour wife is not I se for our auaill.
To the nixt point, at me quhair that e speir
How I have fairne, in quhat sort was my cheir
In our absence surely I say ow richt
Sa greit ane storm as their was isternicht
Baid I never, sen first time I was clekkit,
Nor it my deid sa sair I not suspekkit:
As that same nicht, but dout I say ow plain,
For verray feir of fyreflauchts hale and rain.
All the nicht ouir it ranit sa on me,
That I beleuit but dout drownit to be.
Than said the wife, Schir e believe our Py,
Now e may know quhat kin a woman am I.
Ze may now se, and alswa may persaif,
In times bygaine how that our Py did raif.
Ane fairar nicht was never on the plain
Nor was y^ nicht that scho sayis it was rain:
Ane fairar nicht, ane softer and mair cleir
Mair plesand nicht I had not all this eir,
Thairfoir e sall in all times forth to cum,
Gif her na faith na mair nor scho war dum.
Than this Burges wist not weill quhat to say
Bot to nichtbouris sone past he on his way
And demandit gif sit ane nicht was fair
That his Pyot tholit the cauld and ^air.
They said nichtbour, I walkit all that nicht,
Mair solatious, mair softer and mair bricht
Mair stabill ane nicht, mair curious and cleir:
Nor was that nicht saw I not this seuin eir.
Unto his house this Burges bownit hame,
And thocht richt weill his wife had seruit na blame
The silly Py he put all in the wite,
And of all faults he thocht his wife was quite.
And said to her I find ow traist and true
Quhairfoir e sall have na cause for to rue.
At my nichtbours I have speirit all about
Euin as e say Ilk ane they say but dout.
Ane fairar nicht they said culd not be found,
Nor was that nicht, mair softer and mair sound
And it requyris to other quha offendis
With all their heart for to make them amendis.
To ow thairfoir ane garmound of the new
I promeis ow, because I find ow true.
Scho said good Schir saving our reverence
Ze said not sa quhen e gave firm credence
Unto our Py, quhilk falsely on me leid,
Say and that I committit sic ane deid:
That never was into my mind nor thocht,
Nor in this world sic thing I never wrocht.
With her lesingis betuir us scho hes sawin
Ane greit discord, quhilk all about is knawin,
Quhairthrow I am blasphemit and defamit,
Throw all the town, be our falls Py and schamit,
Quhairfoir na meit nor drink sall do me good,
Quhill that I se our falls Pyats heart blude.
Than the Burges unto the Pyat past,
And said falls Py, tell how become this cast:
Upon my wife sa falsely for to lie,
Causing discord often times with her and me.
Is this the thank, the gansell and good deid,
Thou rauders me, sa weill I culd the feid.
With my awin hands, with meits delicait,
Airlie at morn, and als at euin lait.
Throw thy lesings thou hes maid throw the tou^
Ane greit sclander, and foull defamatioun.
Qahairto scho gave na mair consent nor reid.
Nor I my self gave unto Goddis deid.
The silly Py hard her Master say so.
Intill her heart scho was richt wonder woe.
Master (scho said) God knawis gif that I lie,
^our self will traist the verray thing e se.
And weill I wait the thing I said to ow,
I hard and saw, quhy should I not that trow.
The Burges said, I heir the loudlie lie,
Kennis you not weill this taill thou tald to me,
Their was ane nicht sa troublit in the Air
With storm, fyreflauchts, hale, rain and mekill mair
Of Ill wedder thou had na other reid,
Bot bydand ay the bitter hour of deid.
Quhilk is richt falls, and never a word is true,
Thairfoir but dout thy falset thou sall rue:
And fra hence forth thou sall na lesingis make,
Nor of true taillis thou sall not make ane trak.
And in special betuix me and my wife,
The Law will weill that it coist the thy life.
For the greit leis thou did Invent and forge,
With this same knife I sall cut out thy gorge.
Sa in greit wraith he tuik her be the nek,
And with ane knife her heid he did of snek.
The wife saw that, and scho was wonder glaid
To her husband with mirrynes scho said:
Now e have done as ane man of prudence,
Howbeit befoir e gave ouir greit credence
Unto our Py, quhilk ay richt falsely leid,
My heart is blyith quhen I se her bleid.
Now we may leif all our lifetime in rest,
Din scho is gone, that did us ay molest.
For scho was ay the verray Instrument
Betuix us two. all lesingis did Invent.
Be blyith said he, that Instrument is hence,
Forsooth to her I gave ouir greit credence.
Now I know weill all that scho said was falls,
Bot now thairfoir scho hes loist life and hals.
The Burges than blent up about his bigging
And saw ane hole tyruit in the house rigging,
And weill persauit ane lytill Ledder stand,
Ane watter tub, with stanis watter and sand,
Quhilk was down cast upon the silly Py,
Than the Burges weill understood quhairby,
The pure Pyat had cauld her taill richt crew,
All the falset and fassoun than he knew:
How they had causit the Pyat for to lie,
Throw their falset and greit subtilitie.
Now of my wife the falset I persaif,
In time bygaine how scho hes played the knaif.
Not regarding sin schame nor honesty,
Bot on her lufe lyand in harlatrie.
Full woe is me how greit ane ^ule was I,
For her falset to slay my silly Py,
Quhairin I had my pleasure and delight,
Allace, allace, my wife had all the wyce.
Bot in na way my self I can excuse,
That her counsall sa greithe I did use.
Bot in ane part but dout sa I was blindit,
And now the treuth full sickerlie I find it.
Wa worth the time I gave her sic credence,
Or till htr taill I gave sir audience.
Wa worth sic wifes, that are sa Ill Inclinde,
Ever having sic feneit heart and mind.
With dowbill heart full of subtilitie,
I ow assure they ar evil company.
Because my wife hes wrocht me sic like woe,
Heir I gif ouir all mirth, blyithues and Jo.
All Merchandice, houshalding and harbrie,
In time cu^ming, and Pilgrim I will be.
And markis me heir unto the halie land.
Because I find na faith in woman stand.
Sa this Burges for credence that he gaif
Unto his wife, left land and all the laif.
The Master said unto the Empreour,
Schir have e taken this taill into favor:
And quhat it menis, the samin understand.
He said richt weill, Master I tak on hand.
The Master said was scho not ane falls wife
With her lesingis gart reif the Py her life.
The Empreour said, scho was of falset fow
Her greit lesingis nor her life I allow.
Of the pure Py, sairlie I do repent,
That loist her life for saying verament.
Surely Master ane good taill e have tald
And for our saik this day I sall gar hald
My Sone vndeid, the morn quhill it be none,
God thank our grace (quod he) that sic hes done
To the Lord God hartlie I ow commend,
Sa this Master with blyithnes hame he wend

For quhen they mark to do ane m^s.
A thousand sundry gaitis they have
To bring their matter to quheu they have ocht ado.
The wisest men they ay dissaue
And this Burges amang the laue.
It is not sa (quod scho)
Sa priuelie scho did provide,
A posset for the sil^^e Py,
And with sic craft scho culd it gyde
Changeing the wedder and the sky
Thy gadettis did begyle, the pure Py with sic wyle,
Hurde of huredome upon the fie,
Gluttoun of Glue all we may cry
Thou art ane veschell vile.
The sals that thou seruis at my hand
I can not weill Indyte,
To gar thy husband understand
Of sic vengeance thou had na wit
O rank rampand Lyoun, to mischief ever bouk.

For quhen they speik fairest, their taill is ay falsest
They will never gif ouir their cause
Thocht all the world the contrair knawis

At sum time scho will cause a man
To do the thing he will repent
Quhen it is done na way scho can

That this ane day the child thou hes gart save
With thy true Taillis and exempill perfyte
Believing weill sa sall do all the lau^:
Thocht the Empress with her Taillis wald dissaue
The Empreour, all for the Chyldes dispyte,
Bot at the last I wait he will her quyte
Quhen he and e the suith weill dois persaue.
Quhair e find fault their sall e lay the wit.
The Fourt Taill of the Empress.
QVHEN the Empress hard ye child it on lius
Scho great richt sair, and all her hair did rine
Sapand allace wa worth the time and hour
That I was wife unto the Empreour.
Crying, murning and ryfing down her face.
Quhill the greit noyis past out throw all ye place
The Empreour hard the murmr at the last,
In continent he to her Chalmer past:
Inquirit the cause of all her greit distres.
Scho cursed the time that scho was maid empres
W^ld God (said scho) quhe^ I come to their parts
Howbeit that I had four and twenty hearts
Within my bowk, that they had all beue ren^
In small pecis, or I war daily schenc.
On sic fassoun as I am day be day,
Bot that our grace sayis nouther e nor nay*
Bot quhylis e san but dout our Sone sall di^
And other quhylis in greit dispyte of me,
Ze continue his life and takis na cure
Of my greit sturt the greit schame and Iniur^
He did to me and als schame to our sell.
Of this matter quhairto should I mair tell:
For it is knawin out throw the haill country,
To quhat greit schame he purposit to brocht m^
Bot e throw sleuth dillis dou^ and latis ouirdriu^
Sa day be day our Sone is it on live.
The Empreour said I pray ow stand content
And without dout the morn Incontinent,
He sall have Law, without any remeid,
Te be hangit on Gallous to the deid.
Bot isterday it was a principal cause,
That he thoillit not the Judgment and the lawis
Was for a Taill that the Master me tald
Zea, than (said scho) that is y^ thing they wald
Prolong the time, lipning the Court sall change
Gif e do sa, that is ane matter strange.
For their fair wordis good Justice for to brek,
Sa unto GOD e have ane small respek.
Bot I feir sair e with our Masters seuin,
It sall ow chance the same exampill euin,
As anis it chancit into this same Cietie,
Ane Empreour and seum Maisteris had he:
Quhome to he gave credence both day and nicht,
Than him begyld with their falls fraud and slicht
The Empreour said, that taill I pray ow tell
With the Masters and Empreour how it fell.
Scho said quhairto or to quhat fect should I
Tell any taill, quhen it is not set by,
For isterday ane taill to ow I schew,
Quhlik in the self was verray Just and true
For our honor and profit I it tald,
Thairon to think, it on na wise e wald.
For our honor and profit quhat I will say,
Upon the morn the Masters dois away,
And with their taillis daily turns up side do^
Quhilk is but dout for our distructioun.
As in this taill that I sall tell to ow,
And pleis our grace, for treuth e sall it trow.
He said Madame hartlie I ow require,
I pray ow tell, for it is my desire.
That be the same I may the warrar be,
And to eschew falset and subteltie.
Thocht I delay my Sonis saik for ane day,
It not anserris nor clenclie takis away.
I sall it schaw (quod scho) be it our will,
Sa e will give good thocht and mind thairtil
Quod he tell on, and I sall heir it than,
And sa at schort her taill thus gaitis began.
UPON a time I red intill ane Quair,
In this City sum time seum Masters wair
Throw quhais science greit wisdom and leirning
All the Impire was rewlit be their gyding.
The Empreour quhilk at that time did ring.
But their counsall, he tuik in hand na thing.
Sa he them held in sic eis and dainne,
That he culd not weill want their compani^.
They persauing his heart to them sa kind.
His gudelie will, his daily thocht and mind,
That he culd do nathing but their auise,
They war all seuin haldin sa wonder wise.
They kest in mind ane wonder subtell thing.
Be sorcerie* In chant meant and cunning.
That how lang time the Empreour he baid
In his Palice, nouther past forth nor raid.
Bot thairin still held him in company,
He saw als weill as ouy man culd se.
Fra his Palice gif he past any time,
Throw their slicht craft he should not se a stime.
And this they did to the samin Intent,
That they micht mair their liberty frequent,
And Jutromet and use the samin thingis
That apperte^t to Empreours and kingis.
And to dispone at their will all his rent,
This was their mind, their thocht and als Intent
Be the quhilk thing their Masters did purches
Unto them self gold geir and greit riches.
And it howbeit throw their greit sorcerie,
Than maid this king a stime he micht not s^
Of his Palice, quhen he past ay was blind,
Amang them all the way they culd not find.
With all their craft again to gar hun se,
Out of his Palice, bot ever blind was he.
Avone all this* their Masters fand sic craft,
All the Impire almaist they maid clean daft*
Gif any man had dreamit ane uncouth dreme,
The haill knawledge thairof they should expreme
And make thairof Interpretatioun,
For ane Du^at or it aue French Croun.
Quhair^y they gat mair gold and greit tresour
Almaist als much as fra the Empreour.
Sa be this way, and vthers falls and she,
Than conqueist gold greit riches in plenty,
Mair in respect nor had the Empreour,
And to them seum geum daily mair honor.
Sa on ane day quhen that the Empreour,
With his Empress togidder with honor
At their Cablil, to sich in heart began,
The Empress saw* persauit and said than
Quhat is the cause schaw me of our dolor,
Quhy sich e so or takis ow displeasour?
The Empreour said to his Empress agane,
Have I not cause of sorrow and greit pane,
That I sa lang in sic sort should be blind,
And can thairof ua good remedy find.
My Lord (said scho) will e tent to my Taill,
On houestie it sall help and preuaill.
Gif e will do after as I ow say,
Ze sall allow my Taill ane other day.
In our Impire seuin greit Masters e have,
And I believe than seum dois ow dissaue,
And at the cause of all our greit diseis
And all our rowmes yai gide euin as yai pleis
And to them selfis appropriatis our rentis,
Throw their falls wayis and subtel Incha^tme^tis
Gif it be so that they ar found gyltie
Ane schamefull deid doutles they serve to die.
Chairfoir my Lord for all their seum e send.
And speir at them gif they can help to mend
Zour greit diseis, and sair In^irmiti^
Quhair our sicht faillis, again to gar ow se.
Gif they say nay, and can find na remeid,
Charge them schairplie under the pane of deid
And sa e may consider weill and se,
Gif they be cause of our greit Malady.
The Empreour allowit weill this taill,
And thocht richt weill it was for his auaill.
Incontinent was send to them Message,
For to compeir anon they tuik veyage,
And come kneilling befoir the Empreour,
Quha them ressauit in fredome and favor:
And schew to them his greit Infirmity,
How he was blind, and had sic Malady.
And how sum time that he saw wonder weill
And other times how he saw never ane deill.
Tha^ chargeit he them schairplie on pane of deid
Incontinent they seuin should seik remeid.
For it was schawin to him for verity,
They war the cause of his Infirmity.
And gat they not remeid Incontinent
Unto the deith they should be all torment,
Unto their seuin thus said the Empreour,
Quhairof they stude in greit feir and dredour.
Than said their seuin agane with ane consent,
Ze charge us seuin with Inconvenient.
With siclike charge our grace now putis us to
It passis far our power for to do.
It is sa hard and difficill ane thing,
That we can not to good purpois it bring,
Into schort time* bot gif it pleis our grace
For to grant us respet for ten dayis space,
We sall ow gif answer convenient.
Quhairof we traist, our grace sall stand content
Of their answer the Empreour was appleisit,
Believing weill of seiknes to be ^isit.
Sa their Masters unto their counsel past,
To se gif they culd find the way or cact,
Fassoun, Ingine, supply, mean or remeid,
Or any help to save them self fra deid.
And for to haill the Kingis Infirmity,
They kest the way, for them it wald not be.
Quhairfoir they war all seuin richt sorrofow
And said get we na help nor remeid now
To help this charge as we Ilk ane dois ken
Without remeid we are all bot deid men.
Thairfoir let us make travel all fra hand,
Seirche and seik forth Ilk ane in sindrie land
Gif that we can in any country find
In time cu^ming the Empreour be not blind.
And sa they socht in money sindrie town
Be eist, be west south, north both up and down
It hapnit them to ride upon ane day
Throw ane city quhair barnis was at the play
In the mean time come to them ane auld man
And said Masters I pray ow gif e can
Of my nichtis dream to make Interpretatioun
And for our wage I sall ow gif ane Croun.
Ane of the barnis that was than at the play,
To the Masters hard that man siclike say.
And said good man eis gif ane Croun to me,
Quhat menis our dream I sall ow tell trewli^
The auld man said I dreamit this hinder nicht
That in my aird of watter sprang up richt,
A fresch spring well quhairfra come money spri^gs
Throw all y^ ^ird now tell quhat menis sic things
Than said the barn tak e ane spaid good man
In the same place, pas and delf gif e can,
Quhair that e thocht the water fust vpsprang:
Their e sall find within ane space not lang
Ane hurde of gold that sam(...) hoill within,
Sall make ow rich for ay and all our kin.
Sa did this man as the oung barn co^mandit
And as he said, this man richt sa he fand it.
Than past this man to this oung Child agan^
And thocht he wald rewaird him for h^s pane.
And offerit him ane pund of reddy gold,
Quh^lk be na way ressaue fra him he would.
And said good man, na gold I will ressaif
Bot pray for me, at ow na mair I craif.
The seuin Maisteris persauing all this thing,
How ane oung Child of eiris being sa ing
With sic wisdom the ma^ns dream did expone,
Said to them selfis we meruell quhilk is one,
Of sa oung eiris makis sic Interpretatioun
And sine thairfoir takis nouther gold nor croun
Sa at this child their seuin Inquyrit the Name
He said Merling, quhairof I thing na schame.
Quod they our name bruik weill with all weilfai^
We persaue weill e have wisdom and lair.
Ane greit matter we have to ow to schaw,
Of the quhilk few or nane bot we dois know.
Than said the Child schaw me forth our intent
And e sall have answer Incontinent.
Quod they oung Child this is the verray case
Ane Malady haldis the Empreouris grace.
Sa lang as he in his Palice will bide,
And not thairout nouther to gang nor ride,
He seis als weill as ane that ever was,
Bot als sone as he fra his Palice pas
Their takis him than sa greit ane Maladi^.
That all about a stune he may nocht se.
And gif e can the cause heirof discus,
First e sall have ane good rewaird of us,
And secundlie, remeid gif e can find
In time cu^ming the Empreour be not blind:
Out of Palice quhe^ he plesis to pas,
He will ow gif rewaird quhat e will as.
Than said the Child his Malady I know,
Als the remeid thairof I can him schaw.
The Maisteris said we pray ow richt hartlie
Pas with us seuin and beir us company,
Quhill we cum to the Empreouris presence,
Quhair e sall have rewaird and reverence.
Than said the Child Schirs I am reddy now
Pas quhen e pleis and I ^all gang with ow.
And sa all aucht Incontinent past hence,
Quhill they come to the Empreouris presence.
And quhen they come befoir the Empreour.
They hailsit him with reverence and honor.
And said good Lord, sindrie lands haif we soch^
To get ow health and heir we haif ow brocht
Ane good oung Child yt knawis; our Malady
At our pleasure will find help and supply.
In time cu^ming that e sall weill persaue,
^our daily health, and na seiknes to have.
Nouther in ane, nor in nane other pairt,
He hes sic wit in good cunning and Airt.
The Empreour unto their Masters said,
Of our t^thance I am richt wonder glaid.
All that he sayis will e seuin tak on hand,
^e Schir said they at that same we will stand.
For we have seen be good experience,
His greit wisdom, craft and Intelligence.
The Empreour than unto the barn he said,
Sen sic a thing good Child is to ow laid:
The cause thairof at ow I wald Inquire,
And sine my health than harthe I desire.
Than said the Child and pleis our nobil gra^^
We two alone mon talk ane lytill space,
In our Chalmer I sall ow schaw trewlie,
The cause of all our great Infir(...)e.
And quhen he was into the Chalmer led.
He causit cast of all the clais of the bed.
^uh^^k into haist the Empreour causit be done
My Lord he said now heir e sall se sone
Ane meruellous thing* quhilk e hard never tell
Under the bed their was ane mekill well,
Of quhilk their raise ane foull smuke and a rei^
That wald have maid a man both blind and seik
Out of this well their springs seu(...) greit sprigs
The Empreour than he meruellit of si^ things
Under his bed to be and he not wist,
Sa greit a well sa foull ane reik and mist.
He said my Lord, heir planelie e may se
The ^erray cause of our Infirmity.
Without e put their spr^^gis and well away,
To get our sicht agane na wise e may.
The Empreour said I pray ow to me tell,
The nerrest way for to undo this well.
Than said the Child their is na way bot an^
^^f it pleis ow on force it mon be taken.
The Empreour said I pray ow richt hartlie
Schaw me the way* gif sic ane thing may be
Gold nor gudis on na way will I spair
Sa that the treuth to me e will declair.
Gif mannis craft, his natural wit or micht,
Perfect cunning with ^ude science or sliche,
Subtell I^^me* A^rt or experience,
Mi^h^ help my sicht, or thairfoir find defense.
I wald not cure for to gif gold plenty,
S^a^^ for na co^st sa that e gar me se
Without my place als weill as I do in,
Sa our rewaird fra me weill sall e win.
Now sen our grace to me hes g^um credence,
I sall ow schaw be good ^rperience.
The verray treuth their seum springis e se spring
Out of this well* tha^ ar na other thing*
Bot the same seuin Masters be their science,
Quhome to e gif sa firm and greit credence,
Quhilk be their craft cunning and Inchautme^t
Zow to make blind, this well they did Inue^t.
That hiddertillis, both ow and our Impire
Lang time nygane hes reulit at their desire.
About our place ever hes maid ow blind.
To that effect that na fault e should find
Done any way be them or their consent,
That their greit gyle should not be maid patent,
Nor heir co^pla(...) of our Barrou^is and Lordis
Bo^ they allone to aggre si^ discordis:
Nor that Justice should ring into our land,
Bot all sic things should ly into their hand.
And our subiectis to spuile every day,
All that was grene* to ow it should seem gray,
Ze not seeing now should tha^ all be deid,
For our k^ndnes, they can find na remeid.
The Empreour said, now e have to me s^hawin
Of my blind^^s, the cause and maid it knawin
Now the remeid thairof I wald e fand,
Ze sall not want both gold, Lordschip and land,
And p^eis our grace now to ow sall I tell,
The verray treuth* will e do my counsel.
Of our blindues gif e desire remeid.
The first Master, tak and str^ke of his heid,
Than e sall se the first spring of the well
Be quyte away this is the treuth I tell.
Sa ordourlie* quhill they be Ilk ane slane,
And sa e sall recure our sicht agane.
This being done* the well away sall went,
And sa at eis ^ sall get our Jutent*
Quhilk in good haist was done as they thocht ^^cht
And sa agane the Empreour gat his sicht.
And this oung Child rewardit richt richly
Maid him ane Lord and Air of ane country.
Than said ^^ho Lord have e persauit this taill
That I have schawin, for our good and auail
He said richt weill, and thankis ow hartfullie.
For that good Taill that e have tauld to me.
In the same sort their seuin Maisteris said scho
unto our grace they purpois for to do.
Be their falls Taillis, and siclike feneing,
That our cursed Sone may a^ above ow ring
Quhilk God defend* ay quhill the hour I die,
That I never ane other Empreour se.
This Taill (quod scho) I sall make to ow cleir,
Quhat that it menis and pl^is our grace to heir.
He said say forth, e sall have audience,
And commandit Ilk ane to keip silence.

Quhilk well can not richt soue distroyit be,
Ercept e first gar the seuin Masters die.
This being done, the well sa sall e waist.
Gar sla our Sone of this e gif me traist.
Sa well and springis fra tha^ d^stroyit be,
Than e may have all at tra^quillitie.
Zour haill Imp^re weill into piece and rest*
Fors(...)th (quod he) Madame I think that best
Incontinent than gave he strait command,
To the Gallous to leid his Sone fra hand,
Down throw the streit as Officers him sed.
Ane Muster come and at the spurris him sped.
To the Empreour with all good reverence.
Qahome to he said, pas sw^ith fra my presence,
For the good saind that e have send to me:
Ze serve all seu(...) on Gallous for to die.
I send ow seuin my Sone ri^ht weill speiking
Now he is dum, and do can na kin thing.
Bot only ane, this thing I may detest,
Be violence my Queen he wald oppressed.
Thairfoir rewaird na thing e serve of me.
Bot e all seuin with him sall hangit be.
The Master said* I seruit ane better thing.
To my rewaird* nor on Gallous to hing.
Quhair our grace sa^^s* yt now our sone is d^^
God knawis the cause* the time is not it cum.
Of his speiking the time will cum at schor,
Thairfoir I pray our grace to tak comfort:
And e sall se the day approach rich^ neir.
That he sall speik* quhil all this place may hei^
As to our Queen in that point quhair e tell
It is not prou^^ nor nouther is gospel.
Nor for the wordis of ane singular persoun,
Without mair prufe, our sone should not put dou^,
And gif e do for the wordis of our wife
But good knawledge fra our Sone tak ye life.
It sall be war with ow I dar weill say,
Nor chancit a man and his wife on ane day:
Quhilk I sall schaw to ow be narratioun,
And preif the same be good probatioun.
The Empreour said, trow e to do with me
As seuin Maisteris did anis in this Cietie
With their falls taillis unto their native King
Nay, nay, not sa, it sall not be sic thing.
The Master said, the fault of ane or two
Should not redound to rebuke blame or woe
Of all vthers, for it is richt weill kend
Both good and Ill is to the warldis end.
Bot of ane treuth ane thing I sall ow schaw,
Put e our Sone to deid for our wifes saw:
It sall ow chance as did this hinder eir
Unto ane Knicht gif e pleis e sall heir.
The Empreour said I pray ow schaw me richt
Quhat thing become, or chancit to that Knicht
The Master said again our Sone gar call,
Sa to the deid that he na wayis be thrall.
And keip him still my taill quhill I have tald
Than our awin will e have euin as e wald.
Quhen I have done tha^ tak our awin plesour,
I will sa do than said the Empreour.
And sa his Sone again he gart them caw
As for that day he should not thoill the Law.
Sa this Master his exampill began,
And tauld his taill forth like ane cunning man
Bot it his taill farther or we forth set
The Quenis last taill we will not it foret.

The Taill of the Fourt Master.
UPON a time their was ane eldering Knicht
Wise and witty, full of riches and micht.
Had leuit forth money dayis of his life,
Without children, Lemman or maryit wife.
Diners times his freindis come him till,
To se gif it was his pleasure and will
To tak ane wife, and barnis to forth bring,
Throw their counsall he grantit to sic thing.
Sa at the last they gat his wife to be
The Prouestis dochter of all that greit Cietie,
Quhilk was richt rich, weill fauourit and fair
Weill maid at will and was her Fatheris air.
Fra he her saw, he was sa taken in lufe,
That he his heart fra her culd not remufe.
Thocht lufe and favor betuir them micht be scne
Zit all their space na barnis was them b^tucne
Unto the Kirk as scho past throw the streit,
With her Mother scho hapnit for to meit.
Ather other hailsit with greit blyithnes,
And sa began to talk in mirrines.
The Mother said my dochter tell me how
Ze pleis our spous, or how dois he to ow?
Scho said richt Ill, and not with him content,
For he is auld, febill, and Impotent.
Quhen e me staikit upon sa auld ane stick,

For or I come with him in naikit bed
To be drownit I had rather be led:
Or ly with swyne, or I lay be his side,
My flesche it vggis quhen y^ I tuitche his hyde
Hald me excusit I pray ow hartlie Mother,
For it is force that I mon have ane other.
The Mother said my good douchter and deir,
Heir I the pray sic fulischnes forbeir.
With our Father money eiris I have been,
Sic thing of me was never hard nor seen.
Mother scho said, of that na meruell is,
For e two met in outhheid Joy and blis.
And sa I^k ane togidder had solace,
It is not sa with me into this case.
Or I him gat e ken his strenth was gane,
He lyis als still beside me as ane stane:
For he is waik auld, cauld, wai^it and dry,
And as e ken Mother sa am not I:
Bot in my flouris, of outhheid blumand grene
Compair thairfoir is not us two between.
Of his body I can get na solace.
To me thairfoir it is ane heuie case.
Scho said douchter gif sic thou hes in mind,
And to fulage thy heart is sa Inclinde.
Tell me thy mind without feneing in breist,
Quho^e will thou lufe quod scho) mother a priest
The Mother said, gif sic thou wald desire,

Or ane gay Knicht, nor a Priest to thy lufe,
Scho said Mother, thairin I ow reprufe.
Gif that I lude a Knicht or it a Squyre,
Within schort time of my lufe they wald tire.
And tell ouir all into their merines,
And sa me schame, to my greit lithtlynes.
It is not sa e ken with men of Kirk,
For with wisdom and wylines they wirk.
And is als laith their honesty to tine,
In sit affairis, as I wald to do mine:
And counsall keip als quyetlie vnschamit,
As e or I, with our spous wald be blamit.
Also Kirkmen been mair kind to their lufis,
Than vtheris ar, als weill the prettick prufis.
Scho said dochter heir my good counsall now
And it sall be ane good profit for ow.
Auld men e ken ar wonder cautelus,
Wily and fell, and richt outrageus.
In ane manner e sall our husband preif,
Him for to temp, or anger him or grief.
Than gif e chaip but reprufe or smyting,
Lufe quhome e pleis, at our lust and lyking.
The dochter said, sa lang I may not bide,
In all good haist sum lufe I mon provide.
God hes me send sa unhappy ane weird,
That I can get na solace in this cird.
And e our self Mother asweill e ken
Quhat Ill occurris to want pleasure of men
And I rather drink water for ane eir,
Or I sa lang pleasure of men forbeir.
The Mother said dochter for my blyssing,
By^e quhill thou preif or temp him with su^ thing
For our blyssing scho said I will do mair
B^t him to preif, I pray ow to declair.
In quhat fassoun, or q^hat way it may (...)
Scho said dochter that salf I haistelie.
In our Orchard their is ane tree that standis.
The maik thairof they say is in few landis.
In quhilk our spous hes greit lufe and lyking,
Await sum day quhen he gais in hunting.
Cause the same tree Incontinent be cuttit,
And bring it hame or ever our husband wit it.
Thairof make fire agane his cu^ming hame,
Than gif e chaip without reprufe or blame.
At our pleasure than e may tak the Priest,
This e will do for our Motheris requeist
Scho said Mother our counsall I will do
Howbeit in treuth I am richt laith thairto.
Ilk ane hame past unto their awin ludgeing,
The knicht meruellit of his wifes tarying.
Scho said good Schir as I went west the streit,
With my Mother on chance their culd I meit.
Scho speirit at me gif e war in glaidnes.
I said euin sa and than hame did me dres.
After denner the King past in hunting,
Bot his good wife thocht on ane other thing.
And thocht that her purpois fuld cum to end,
Incontinent for the Gardner scho send.
Quhome to scho said cut down this tender tree,
That I thairof man make on haistelie:
Ane greit warm fire agane my Lords cu^ming
He will beliue cum hame from the hunting.
This day is sour, sa wonder schairp and cauld.
And as e know he is febill and auld.
Quhen he cu^mis hame that he sall not want fire
Thairfoir cut down and e sall have our hire.
To quhome he said saif our pleasure Madame,
Cut we this tree but dout we will get blame.
For our husband far better lufis this tree
Ten times ouir, than all the treis heir be,
Bot not the les Madame at our desire
Other fallm wod I sall get to be fire.
Quhairof my Lord (quod he) will stand content
Nay, nay (said scho) cut down Incoutment.
He said na way this tree I will destroy,
For it will put my Master to greit noy.
Scho heiring that, he wald not do command,
The Gardnaris Ax, scho hint into her hand.
The tender tree scho cuttit at the rute.
That fra thine forth it should never have fruit.
Causit seruandis the samin hame to beir,
Of her husband thairof taking na feir.
The Knicht at euin fra hunting cu^ming hame,
Huuting the wild in Forest with the tame.
His wife him met, and said gu^e Schir I know
Ze ar werie and wonder cauld with aw,
I causit to big ane fire to ow thairfoir,
To make ow cherie, and mirrie be the moir.
I thank ow dame said he with all my heart,
Get I good cheir, than e sall have our part.
Than in he come, and sat down on ane bink,
Befoir the fire, and cryit for meit and drink.
Quhilk in all haist to him richt sone was brocht
And thairof dra^k blyithlie quhil he good thocht
In the mean time the smell persauit he
Of his oung plant, and best belouit tree.
To him he callis the Gardnair richt sone,
And said mischant, quhat hes thou to me done?
Weill I persaue my plant birne in the fire,
Thairfoir at me thou hes not seruit thy hyre.
He said my Lord, it is true that e tell,
Nane did that turn bot our awin wife her sell.
Than said the Knicht I wait that can not be.
That my awin wife wald do sit thing to me,
For weill scho knew that tree I lufit best,
Be twenty fauld nor I did all the rest.
I wait scho wald never consent thairtill,
Because scho knew that it was not my will.
Scho said good Lord I cry ow heir mercy,
For it was I that cuttit down the try.
Knawing richt weill e war werie forgane,
Cauld, waik and tyrit, and good fire had we nan^
And I did it our curage to refresche,
To make ow blyith, and to comfort our flesche
That was the cause I gart this fire on make,
Only for ow, and for nane vthers saik.
Quhen the Knicht hard it was the samin tree.
Onto his wife he said richt angerlie:
O wickit wife how durst e be sa bald,
To cut the tree, that I in na wayis wald
Seen been cut down for greit riches and rene,
I make ane vow e sall it sair repent.
And knawing weill, I lude it all the best,
Ze have me maid ane fault richt manifest.
Quhen that scho saw her husband discontent,
Than scho began to weip and als lament.
On feneit sort her self for to excuse,
At siclike time as women often times dois,
Schir I it did for our utility,
And e it takis agane ouir crabitlie.
For I beleuit to win thairthrow good deid
And now I get greit magrie to my meid
For it that I do ever for the brst
Ane ^euin rewaird I get ay reddyest.
I had rather be brint intill ane coill
Nor for good mind sit outrage for to thoill.
Than scho began to weip and make murning,
Incontinent the Knicht that persauing,
And sa at schort was mouit with mercy,
And said my Joy our murning now lat be.
In time cu^ming se that e not me mufe
To displesure nor hurt the thing I lufe.
Thairfoir be war, the dayis of our lifetime,
That never agane e commit sic a crime.
As for this time heir I forgive ow clean,
Ceis weip na mair, be still and dry our Ene.
Than the nixt day to Kirk scho went agane,
Met her mother quhome of scho was richt fane,
Good morn mother (quod scho) with heart and breist
Now weill aneuch faith I may lufe the Priest.
And I have done euin as e counsallit me,
My handis cut down his best belouit tree,
Sa our counsall I did intill all thing,
Bot fra he saw that I maid sit murning
He chereist me, and hes forgeuin me quyte,
Thairfoir Mother put me not in the wit
Howbeit I lufe the Priest with all my heart,
For my good man he keipis me not a part.
The Mother said thocht auld men anis forgeif,
In time cu^ming after and e them grief:
They will trewlie pans the nixt fault agane,
And puneis it perchance with dowbill pane.
My counsall is temp him ane other tide,
Allace Mother (quod scho) I may not bide.
For I suffer mair pane for one same Priest,
Nor I can schaw or think into my breist.
Anerdone me my sweit Mother thairfoir,
Of our counsall now I will tak no moir.
The Mother said, for the lufe thou should have
To me, because my Cors did the consaue:
Of my bosum, as ane Bab did the beir,
And for the blyssing of thy Father deir:
In this behalf it temp him anis agane,
Gif e get quyte than I forgive ow plane,
To lufe the Priest, or ouy that e pleis,
Scho said that taill to me dois greit diseis.
Fra my pleasure for to remain sa lang,
Forsooth Mother e ar sa far in the wrang.
Nevertheless for my Fatheris blyssing
^it anis agane I sall give him temping.
How it sall be, first e mon to me schaw,
All the fassoun I pray ow let me know.
^our husband hes quod scho ane litill hound
He will not cois for money merk and pound,
He lufis sa weill, that nichtlie in his bed,
He makis his couche, and with fine meit is fed
With his awin hands se e the same hound keil
Befoir his Ene, sa e may wit richt weill
This being done, be e not puneist than,
Go lufe the Priest, or any other man
I gif ow leif, I sall ow never blame,
Sa it be not to our greit sin and schame.
Scho said Mother I will our counsall do
At this present, quhat e will charge me to.
For their is not ane barn I wait leuand,
Sa feign wald keip of my eild the command
Of her parents, and now withouttin skaith,
I will obrene the blyssing of ow both.
And now Mother remember in our thocht
For our blyssing I did ellis wald I nocht.
And than scho said my sweit Mother adieu.
Quhat thocht I have I pray God gif e knew.
Than come scho hame and put of as scho micht
That langsum day, quhill it come to the nicht.
And sa at euin commandit that her bed,
With purpour clais and silk should be ouir spread.
Quhilk the seruandis at her command hes done
With coistlie clais the bed they spread it sone.
And quhen the bed was this at reddy maid,
The litill hound thairon hes him down laid.
As his custom was and conswerude,
Als the good wife knew weill that he wald dude
And up scho raise with mind malicious,
With haitrent heart and vult richt venomous.
Be the hind heillis this hound than did scho tak
And all his harms out on the wall scho straik.
Sayand quhat devil dois this tyke on our bed,
That is sa rich and all with silks ouirspred.
Quhen the Knicht saw his litil hou^d was slane
Fra crabitnes na way he culd refrane.
Bot till his wife with angry heart can say,
Wickit woman out of my sicht away:
How culd thou find into thy cruel mind,
To sla the hound that to me was sa kind?
And ouir all hounds with my awin heart was lufit
O wickit wife Mahoun thy heart hes mufit,
To do sic thing and me to Ire Incres,
O cursed catiue woe to thy cruelnes.
Scho said good man have e not richt weil seen
How this foull tyke with his feit sa unclean
Upon our bed hes line and fylit the same
Have e pleasure thairof or any game,
Foull traikit tykis vyon our bed to ly,
Thocht e pleis sa, the same it pleis not I
To spill our bed that is sa precious,
Couerit with clais sa clean and curious.
With his foull feit cum new forth of the mire,
I rather have brint the bed and all in fire.
Than said the knicht with ane angry visage,
Knew thou not weill, that I had greit curage
Into ane Leische my hound for to se led,
Ane hunder times, nor lying in my bed.
I rather geum all my horse quhair they stand
Or e had taken sic wickit deid in hand.
Than quhen scho saw the knicht sa discontent,
And in sum part raisit in matalent:
To weip and rair in all haist scho began,
Sayand allace that ever I knew ane man.
For quhen I was into my virgin flouris
I knew nathing of their schairp winter schouris
For any tyke in this wise to be schorit,
Quick in my grave I had rather be smorit.
For all that I for the best dois pretend,
Ze ay allege that I thairin offend.
Howbeit my mind be ever true and good
I get na thank, this schortlie I conclude.
Than this auld knicht persauing the greit cai^
Weiping, murning with reuthfull heart and sai^.
As he beleuit, he said lat be sic thing,
And at this time e make na mair murning,
I pardone ow, under protestatioun
In time cu^ming e make na occasioun,
Me for to mufe to anger or to Ire,
For gif e do, at sum time I will tire.
Ze know richt weill e cuttit down the tree,
And now at schort my hound e have gart die.
Do not siclike I harthe ow requeir,
For gif e do, na mair I can forbeir
To puneis ow, for all that is gane by
To the vtrest remember weill sall I.
Thairfoir be war make me not discontent
At ow na mair, and sa to bed they went.
Sa on the morn at time up sone scho raise
With mirrie mind, and put on all her clais.
Went to the Kirk, and sa her Mother met
Believing weill of her good leif to get:
To lufe the Priest, and fyld her husbandis bed,
Bot as God wald sic thing was na thing sped
They hailsit other as they thocht best be done,
And in talking togidder they fell sone.
Scho said Mother ouir lang for our requeist,
I have the lufe forletit of the Priest.
For now I have temptit my husband twyis
Hangit be I quhen that I tempt him thryis.
Be our counsall ane greit thing I have done,
By my consait money stages abone.
For as e bad I cuttit down his try,
And now laitlie I gart his good hound die.
And both their faultis he hes forgeuin me quyte
In time cu^ming to me e put na wit.
With all my mind and heart within my breist,
In all good haist I will ga lufe the Priest.
The Mother said I pray the douchter deir,
With patience two wordis thou wald me heir
It is weill knawin with ma nor I can tell.
That ay auld men ar sle and cruel,
And will think on upon faultis done befoir.
Howbeit sum time they will not chyde nor schoir
For it is said, and als richt weill I wait,
That cruelty it is appropriat
To eldering Knichtis y^ in outh hes been kene,
Sine in their eild they turn to tray and tene.
And for sum fault will puneis with rigor,
As they in mind it takis in displesour.
Z^t my counsall thairfoir I wald thou did,
And thairefter I sall the not forbid:
Lufe quhome thou list, or quhome you lykis to lufe
Their is my hand I sall the not reprufe.
Zit temp him anis as we can best devise,
For it is said that all things thryfis bot thrice.
Scho said Mother I heir ow talk in vane,
Knew e the thocht and nichtlie burning pane,
That I suffer continually in heart,
I wait e wald not tak my contrapart.
Ze ar Mother ane woman as I am,
Quhat wald e say, gif e wantit the game
Of my Father, that e richtlir bruik,
For ane new lufe but dout sone e wald luik.
With all our pith the same e wald purches,
And haist the same with all our besines.
Into this case now put our mind to rest.
To lufe the Priest good faith I think it best.
Scho said dochter for the greit pane and cure
I had of the that time quhen I the bure.
And sor the fude thairof quhilk that the fed,

Till the third time, I pray the him to prufe,
As thou will have my blissing and my lufe.
Deny me not this sober small petitioun,
And I promeis to the ane sure conditioun.

To thy pleasure, and als Intandement.
And never say that thou hes done ane mis,
My sweit dochter I pray the grant me this.
As thou will have my blissing on thy banis,
My small desire I pray the grant me anis.
The dochier said, Mother I ow declair,

That I may not sa lang abstene thairfra,

For the greit charge first that e say to me,
And sine agane e have promeist trewlie
Into this case to further forth my cause,
Gif I had neid the richteous God it knawis
Thairfoir schaw me the manner and the way,
How I sall temp him to the third effray.
The Mother said on Sunday nixt cu^mand

Her Mother weill persauit the fassoun.

The m^it is spilt and f^lit ar all clais.
The K^^cht ^hangeit countenance in his face,
And smylit for scorn that sa occurrit the ca^e.
And sufferit ouir with blyith dissimula^^e.

And commandit ane new Tabill be set

And prayit his gaistis for to be blyith and glaid
How beit his Tabill was reckleslie down laid.

Making good their to all the company,
With mirrynes welcu^mand them glaidlie.

The dennet done, they thankit all the Knicht
And als his wife, and bad them both good nicht
On the nixt morn the Knicht airlie he raise,
In name of God, first to the Kirk he gais.
And after he had his deuotioun done,
To a^e Harbor but tarry past he sone.
Saying Master ar e gudlie expart,
In blude latting, or Insicht in that Art?
He said good Schir I am expart trewlie
Of every vain within a mannis body,

In drawing blude thairof greit craft I can.
Than said the Knicht thairof I am content,
Cum on with me and e sall have payment.
Sa the Harbor hame with the Knicht he went.
And be the gait he tauld him his Intent.
And sa they come unto the Knichtis ludgeing,

He said good dame get up for e men rise,

Scho said good Sthir sen my Mother m^ (...)
Blude upon me was lattin never mair.
And now thairof sen I want conswetude,

Than said the Knicht, forsooth e ar the war,
To lat ow blude sa lang that e defar.
Think e not on quhat faultis e have maid me
First e hewit down my Nobill plant and tree.
Quhilk e knew weill that I lude all the best,
And sine e know how that my hound e dressed.
And isterday our freindis being present,
At the Tabill sa cruelly me schent.
Gif I suffer that e do the fourt wrang,
In conswetude and use sa e sall gang.
Within schort time e sall me sa constrane,
To utter schame, that I can noe refrane:
My self fra schame, without I find remeid,
And I find weill sum fault is in our heid:
Of corrupt blude, that mon be lattin out,
And als wild blude in our body but dout.
That fra thine forth e sall na mair heir blame
Nor anger me, nor it put me to schame.
He causit seruandis but any mair abaid
In the Chalmer ane greit fire to be maid.
S^ho seeing that scho trowit without remeid
Into that fire for to be brint to deid.
Tha^ cryit scho loud for Gods saik grant mercy
And I promit ow a thing faithfully.
In all my dayis I sall ow never grief,
Sa this ane time that e will me releif.
And have piety. I grant I did trespass,
Thairfoir good Schir mercy at ow I as.
Than said the Knicht be him that mercy maid
Streich e not forth our arm but mair abaid:
Quhair I Intend bot of our blude have part,
I sall have all the heart blude at our heart.
To the Harbor also he said in plane,
Se that e cut ane greit hoill in the vane.
Or be Sanct George the same thing e sall have
For our rewaird, that scho should now ressaue.
The Harbor seeing he gat sa sair ane charge,
He maid ane woo^d, that was both deip and large
On that ane arm, quhill that the blude ran dou^
Abundantly, and with greit effusioun.
Quhilk for to stanche the Knicht wald nathing thou
Bot rather bad make mair larger the hoill
Unto the time he saw her change color,
That wound to stanche he causit the Harbor
And bad him strike into that other arm,
Als grit ane wou^d, quhairof he thocht na harm
Scho said husband have mercy now on me,
I am sa waik, I traist schortlie to die.
Tha^ said the Knicht e should have thocht on this
Anis* twice, thrice, quhen e committit mis.
Quhilk causis me richt sair aganis my will,
Of our wild blude sa mekill to se spill,
For I sure ow he leuis not upon life,
That wald have drawin sa much blude on my wife
Except my self thairto had geuin cousent,
But dout that ane of us should sair repent.
Bot at this time our awin licht wilfulnes,
Hes causit me on this manner ow dres.
For e have done sic wickit turnis three,
Quhairfoir but dout that puneist e mon be.
Than the Harbor causit her lay forth on breid
That other arm, that he micht cause her bleid.
And than he straik upon that other side
Into her arm ane wound both deip and braid
Quhill that the blude abundantly ran down,
That all beleuit that scho should fall in swoun.
With ane waik voice scho cryit richt pieteouslie
My sweit husband have mercy now on me.
For I believe because I am our wife
Ze covet not that I should lois the life.
Than said the Knicht to the Harbor agane,
I think it best that now e stanche one vane
Now presently, na mair e lat it bleid,
The Harbor said, sa sall I Schir in deid.
That being done, the Knicht he gave command
To his seruandis, that they should sone fra hand
Put her in bed that scho micht get sum rest,
The Harbor said good schir I think that best.
Than bad his wife remember in her mind,
In time bygane sa Ill scho was Inclinde.
And mis amend, or I hecht be the Rude,
Do e not sa, I sall se our heart blude.
Than the harbor at this good eldering knicht
Ressauit his wage, and at him tuik good nicht.
Than the seruandis in mind they thocht it best
Their awin husie to put her to sum rest.
Sa in her bed they happit her esilie,
Quhen they beleuit nathing bot her to die.
Scho being laid sa softly in her bed,
Heuie at heart, richt faint and all forbled.
Ane damisell scho bad into all haist,
Fetch her Mother or scho eildit the Gaist.
Quha in all haist that to her Mother tald
Zour dochter the spreit scho will vpald.
And cum e not, I say to ow trewlie,
Scho is sa faint, we trow all scho sall die.
Than the Mother Inquyrit secreitlie
Quhat was the cause of her Infirmity.
The damisell to her the fassoun said,
Quhairof y^ Mother was wonder blyith and glaid
That her dochter sa trimly was correctit,
Howbeit that scho the samin not suspectit.
Sa ou scho come unto her dochters place,
To considder the fassoun and the race.
And als sone as scho hard her Mother speik,
My sweit Mother (said scho) I ow beseik,
To set ow down and rest at my bed heid,
For I believe na thing bot only deid.
Of my body so much blude I have bled,
That I on force behuifit to tak bed.
Throw very fault of febilnes of blude,
That of my life I trow to be denude.
The Mother said, my sweit dochter and deir,
Tauld I ow not ane word was not in weir:
That ay auld men was schairp bitter and fell,
Richt outrageous, dispitefull and cruel.
Howbeit sum time a fault they wald ouirse.
Zit at the last they wald it puneis hie.
My dochter now ane questioun I will speir,
Howbeit e be richt waik now lyand heir.
Tell me the treuth and oppin to me our breist,
In time cu^ming gif e will lufe the Priest.
Quha said agane, allace Mother lat be,
Ane warldis schame mot tak all Preistis for me
The heich vengeance of the greit God abufe,
Mot quell them all or I ane of them lufe.
Bot my husband that is both deir and sweit,
Their is na man in world for me sa meit.
The Mother said, quhy should e have dispite
At the pure Priest or give him any wite:
For I believe our mind he never knew,
Nor in sic race he did ow not persew.
Bot weil I know quhat thing y^ gart ow dude,
The wantones and abundance of blude.
Quhilk I believe at this time now e want,
For e behude have sum thing ow to dant.
Mother (said scho) I pray ow let me rest,
Abone all men my husband I think best.
The Master said than to the Empreour,
Schir have e taken this taill weill in ordour:
And considerit thairof the moral sense,
The Empreour said Master be my conscience
It is the best and wonder lefull taill
That I have hard this money eir but faill.
To her husband scho did schrewde turnis three,
First scho cuttit his nobill tender tree:
Sine slew his ho^^ quhilk was bot a dum beist
And than thridlie misfassonit all the Feist.
Gif he had thoillit the fourt for to been done,
It should have brocht him to confusioun sone.
The Master said I counsall ow heirfoir,
Tent to our wife, gif her credence no moir.
Slae our sone (for her wordis) vnoffendit
Ze sall forthink quhen e can not amend it.
The Empreour said, I say to ow trewlie,
My sone this day for our saik sall not die.
The Master said, I thank our Nobill grace,
That for my saik hes pardonit him sic space.
Sa tuik his leif, as culd him weill effeir,
And sa hamewart to his awin house culd speir.
Or we proceid now to the Empress taill
Sum we will talk of the Doctouris but faill.
MORALITAS.
ZE may persaue now be this taill
Good counsall is of greit auaill
Qnha that will tak it weill in heid
Fra vice to vertew it sall him leid
And ay be reulit with ane good reid,
This is forsooth but faill
Good counsall is ane precious thing
Outher to Empreour or King
It lattis all thing for to ga wrang
The King nor Empreour never rang
And gif they want good counsall lang
with reule they sall not ring.
All greit perrellis it settis on side
With wisdom it dois all provide,
God it grantis to all degreis
Bot money sa fast fra it fleis
Quhill they be set upon their kneis
They have na grace to gyde.
This oung woman had fair offendit
Gif her Mother had condiscendit
To her dochteris unwise consait,
In her contrair scho maid debait
And gart it gang ane other gait
Good counsall sa defendit.
The Mother was greit till allow,
That causit her dochter till her bow,
Throw good counsall anis, twyse and thryse,
Saying dochter and thou be wise
Tak not in hand sic Interpryse
Except thou it auow.
And sa be counsall of her Dame
Scho continewit her glaikit game
Howbeit scho rang in rampand rage.
Good counsall causit her to assuage.
Quhill that the Harbor for his wage
Maid her meik as a Lam.
Say e not bot it was despyte
First cuc the tree, the hound to smite,
Syne cast the Tabill sa rekleslie
How can scho weill excusit be
Scho was wyteles a lytill we
Wantones had the wit.
And heit of blude was abundant,
Quhairof sum part scho micht weill want
Her husband than tuik weill in heid
How be thairof should get remeid
Quhair her blude was he laid cauld leid,
And this way culd her dant.
Sa quhen the Mother come to se
Quhidder gif scho wald leif or die
Quha said dochter for my requeist
Now lay thy hand to thy awin breist
And se gif thou will lufe the Priest
Ceis Mother lat that be.
For had not been our good counsel
But recure I had schamit my sell,
And as e ken I was richt thra
For all our sawis, to cum thairfra,
Now thankis to God it is not sa,
Good counsall beiris the bell.
The Priest of all this was wyttles
Of my baudrie and brukilnes
For he thairof never thing knew
Nor I to him sic thing not schew
Bot was in purpois to persew
Thairfoir he was saikles.
Zoung women heirfoir in our flouris
Thocht e think pride of Paramouris
Tak heir exampill how I am,
And set on side sic sawreles game
Or e sall sair repent the same
The time was mine as ouris.
Ze auld men that are cum to age
Zoung women into Marriage
In na manner is for ow meit
They ar wantoun and full of heit
To ow is sour that they think sweit
And skant to get for wage.
Thairfoir in time e should correct tham^
With aw and laubour e should brek tham^
Let them not braull on every bink.
For as e brew sa sall e drink
Perchance have matter to forthink
And greit cause to suspect them.
To this talking e should tak tent
Or efterwart e fall repent
Quhen e ar maid Johne Thomsounis man
Than sall e braull, than sall e ban
And quhen remeid nane find e can
Bot all with schame ouirschent.
Now e ar warnit, I bid adieu
We are ouir good quhair we are true,
Their is ouir few is faithful found
Sum cuttis the tree, sum killis the hound,
Sum castis the Tabill to the ground
As I did, that I rue.
Ane praise to the fourt Doctor.
LAVDE, honor, praise, and thankis ane hunder fald
To the Doctor for the Taill thou hes tald,
That sauit hes the Chyldis life for ane day,
And quenched hes the Empreouris boist sa bald
In greit malice, quha that but mercy wald
His awin sone slain, bot thou him causit say nay
Thocht one quick Feind dois all that ever scho may
To have him slain, bot we sall all defy her
Within few dayis on reid weir we sall cry her.
The Fyft Taill of the Empress.
THe Empress heiring y^ child it was not deid
Ane new consait than tu^k scho in her heid,
Throw all the town gart fie in alkin artis
The carage horse yat wald draw wanis and cartis
And fil^it the same with alkin kind of geir,
Her Ornamentis and clais that scho should we^e.
Maid her to pas unto her Father hame.
Saying scho wald na langer thorll sic schame.
As scho did daily that all man micht se,
And thairupon culd not reuengeit be.
Quhairfoir scho wald at her father seik mendis
Quhome on scho said all her hope clean dependis
The seruandis sa persauing her Intent
To the Empreour they schew Incontinent.
Quha past to her in haist but mair process
Inquirit the cause of all sic besines.
Quhair mark e to, or quhidder will e go
Quhat is the cause that e ar muifit so?
Scho sayis I will but any mair delay,
To my Father the hie gait make the way.
Quhair I may have both solace mirth and game
Bot now I have the contrair of the same.
Thairfoir I mon persew quhair I may get it,
For at this time e gar me quyte foret it.
The Empreour said will e get mair solace
Nor bide with me, I trow into na place.
For I had hope their was na man on life
Was better lude nor I with his awin wife.
Now I persaue the verray clean contrair,
That bowi^s away in other place to fair.
Scho said my Lord, for that cause I depart
For I lufe ow with sa perfect aue heart,
That I rather of our deith to heir tell,
Nor be present, and for to se it my sell.
Of our Maisteris e tak far mair delight,
To heir their taillis all tauld in my despite:
That I am quite put forth of our credence
Ze gif to them sa Inwart attendence.
Thairfoir it sall chance ow or all be gane
Far worse nor did unto O^tauiane,
Quhilk this Impire as e now presently
Had for to gyde, and deit in misery.
He was sa falls, and als sa covetous,
That his subiectis held him sa odious.
They war constranit for his greit falsitie
To eird him quick for all his dignity,
Because Ilk man sa covetous did him hold,
They et his mouth full of het meltit gold.
To quhome quod he, let not sic thing be said,
That of falset the blame to me be laid.
Scho said but dout the blame lyis all in ow,
For day be day all time e gar me trow
Zour Sone should die, and it he leuand is,
And weill e know that he did me greit mis.
Thairfoir believe that farther mair from hence,
In that behalf I give ow na credence.
The Empreour said it becu^mis not ane King,
Without counsall to discus every thing.
And in special for to give Judgment
On my awin sone without good auisement.
Thairfoir Madame I pray ow hartfullie,
That e wald schaw sum good exampill to me:
Quhairthrow I may my realm with wisdom gyde
And to my self ane esie life provide.
Scho said I sall ane story to ow schaw,
Quhairby e may weill and perfitelie know
To reule our Realm, and hald our self perfect
Sa e will make ow of the seuin Maisteris quite
Of their counsall e ar ouir covetous
And of their taillis e ar ouir desirous.
Zit not the les my taill forth sall I say,
And gif e pleis the sentence beir away.
BEfoir our dayis their was both hard and seen
Kingis, Empreouris into this town hes been
Amang the rest I remember on ane
Quhilk callit was to Name Octauiane.
Sa covetous as he was to win gold,
I never red ane formit on the mold.
The Cietizanis that time as I hard say
They had greit weiris with all about the^ lay.
And all Natiounis richt cruelly they dantit,
Quhair they tribute or any manrent wantit.
Quhill that it come to sic het point of weir.
That all Natiounis in their contrair did steir.
In that mean time yair was ane master Clark
Dwelling in Rome, richt cunning in his wark.
Callit Virgill, the quhilk in Arsmetrik,
He was sa sle, that nane was found him sik.
The Cietizanis this Clark they did require,
That he wald wirk, and win fra them good hire
To find sum way be his craft and cunning
For to Ingraue sum Image or sic thing,
Of his pretik, Ingine or Industry,
Subtell science, or it Nycromansie.
Quhairby yt they micht have perfect knawlege,
Quhen Enemeis to weirfair maid veyage:
And to eschew fra all adversity,
And seik fordwart their awin prosperity.
Quhairby they micht provide their purueya^c^
For good or evil quhidder that it did chance.
The Cietizans than with this cunning Clark
Maid ane accord, and sa fell to his wark.
Within the town he buyldit up ane Tower,
Of ane greit hicht, and als of greit valor,
And set upon the samin Towris heid,
Greit Images of Irne, Tin, bras and Leid.
To the number be their awin discriptiounis,
As their was than in all the world of Regiou^is
In the middis of that samin Tower of hicht,
Ane greit Image he set to all mannis sicht.
And in the hand it bure ane goldin ball,
As it should been the Master of them all.
And Ilk ane had of the rest be them sell,
Into their hand ane lytill ring and bell,
And turnit their face to the same Regioun,
To them assignit, and tuik dominioun.
^if any Realm or Regioun up wald rise,
In contrair Rome, or rebel any wise.
Than that Image to any Ilk Regioun,
It had respect, or it dominioun
Wald mufe the face, and also ring the bell,
And them to warn it wald not faill to tell
Than the Romany or any fais wist,
That rebellioun raise for to resist.
And armor them into all faitis of weir,
As them become, or to them culd effeir.
And sa small land their was in Christindome
Bot be that way was maid subject to Rome.
Quhairthrow yai wa^ grit worschip and honors
Ouir all the world they war callit conqu^rours
This being done this nobill cunning Clark,
In Romes town he maid ane other wark.
Quhilk was ane fire continually burning,
Both nicht and day, and never had slokning.
To the pepill being ane greit comfort,
Solace and mirth, blyithnes and mekill sport.
Two bathing fattis he maid within the town.
To commountie greit consolatioun.
The ane was cauld, preparit for simmer sessoun
The other het, for winter quhilk was ressoun.
^if any man his body wald refresche,
Pas to that ane thairwith he micht him wesche
Betuix their Bathis, and this continual licht,
Ane Image maid of greit stature and hicht.
With sic Ingine, sa lang as their it stude
The fire should birne, and ay the Bathis do good.
In quhais foirheid was writin with letters fine
Quha strykis me down greit treasure sal yaitine
And mair atouir it may fall sic ane chance,
Quhen yai have done to tak ane greit vengeance
This Image was maid with sic craftines,
Till that it stude, and thoilland na distres.
The fire lestit, and never mair eid out,
The baths two stude in yair awin ply but dou^
Quhill at the last ane cunning Clerk come by,
And this Image perfitelie culd es^^.
The writing red, and to him self he said,
Quhat kin vengeance can on ane man be laid.
Or quhat treasure may any man now t(...)e?
That strykis the down or puttis the to ruin.
Bot I believe rather hid for to be,
Under thy feit sum greit sowmes of money.
Sum rich Jowellis of gold or sum treasour,
That thou art sa set up with sic honor.
This I believe, and is the liklyest,
And sa at schort that Image down he kest,
To that effect sum treasure to obtene,
Bot nane he gat, because nane their had been.
Bot sa sone as that Image fell but dout,
Incontinent the fire was quenchit out.
The Baths two was vanischit out of sicht,
Did never good, nor after had na micht.
The pure pepill heirof was wonder sorry,
That they war sa destitute of sic glory.
Both of their Baths, and of their lestand licht
Quhilk to them did greit comfort day and nicht
Saying Ilk ane with loud voice to the air,
Cursed mot he be for now and ever mair.
That us sa quyte of comfort hes maid clean,
That we sa lang in conswetude hes been.
For his pleasure and profeit singulair,
^o be to him with sturt and mekill cair.
Zit not the les their treasure gat he none,
And our plesures all quyte away is gone.
In this mean time was leuand Kingis three,
^o quho(...)e Romany had done greit vilanie,
Be greit murder and malice them molest,
With cruel weiris, and slauchter them oppressed
On quhome they wald richt fane reue^geit been
Sa to counsall their three Kingis did conuene.
With yair Barrou^s, yair Lords and yair knichts
And vthers men of greit wisdom and michts.
How that they micht on Rome reuengeit be,
For their slauchter and their greit vilanie:
Unto them done in diverse times went,
And culd na way on them get assythment.
Quhen diverse dayis they had at counsall been
Sum of them said this auaillis not ane prene,
Their michtis is far above all our puissance,
Thairfoir we think sum other conuoyance:
We mon attempt, and new consaitis considder,
Thairfoir lat all our wittis now ga togidder.
Than four auld Knichtis y^ was of cou^sall good
Befoir their King and Lordis up they stude,
Saying their wordis we think we wirk in vane,
On this matter sa lang for to remain.
For treuth it is quhil yair greit tower vpstandis
With Images and bellis into their handis,
Quhilk warnis the^ quhen any Region^ will rise,
In their contrair, than pas they to devise
Remeid thairfoir, quhat land aganis them stei^
With all defense, and cruel fait of weiris.
Sa we mon rin upon ane other burde,
Eschew the deip, and cast us to the furde.
Than said the Kingis quhat think e best to do
Quod they pleis e our counsall to stand to,
Sa that e will thairon to make the coist.
We sall ow pleis or ellis our heidis be loist.
Than said the Kingis for coist se e not spair,
Thairof e sall be answerit and far mair.
Than said the Knichtis the matter standis thus
Octauiane e know is covetous,
And lufis gold e ken above measure,
Thairfoir he mon be blindit with treasure.
The sicht of gold will gar him sa Inclinde,
To all our sawis, he hes gold sa in mind.
Pakkit richt weill four Punsiounis to the heid
Ze mon furneis of cuineit gold sa reid.
With good conuoy and ordourlie expense.
Quhill that we get the Empreouris presence.
This being done, get e not our Intent
We sall all four tine landis life and rent.
The Kingis said, go to it sall be done,
They maid fordwart, the gold was gottin sone
Four full punsiounis of gold that was sa bricht
To Romes town they brocht within the nicht.
Na man knawing quhat their within was closit
To their purpois quhen yai the^ thocht disposit
Their four Punsiounis into four sindrie artis
In Romes town they hid at diverse partis.
Sum in Fuseis, in draw wellis and in dykis,
Laich in the eird, and sum they sank in sykis.
This being done, they come in quyetlie,
To their hostage, and lay down preuilie.
And on the morn at time of day they raise,
With good Intent, and to the Palice gais.
And sa belyue as they past up the streit,
It chancit them the Empreour for to meit.
They hailsit him with reverence as effeirit,
Agane at them richt patiently he speirit:
From quhe^ce they come or quhat service culd do
To quhat science they war may abill to.
Quha answerit him into their best maneir,
From far countries to our grace cu^min heir.
We are spa men, suithsayaris and deuinouris,
To serve our grace, and als our counsa(...)ris.
And can discus all dreams sa cunningly,
And tell thairof the treuth and verity.
And all hid geir that is put out of sicht:
We can it find, and thairto ga at richt.
Be our awin dreams our craft is and Ingine,
Thocht it war hid ane thousand eiris sine.
And we have hard that our grace hes pleasure
In sic behalfis, and thairon takis cure.
And gif our grace at us sic will require.
We are reddy to fulfill our desire.
Be day or nicht into all kind of sort.
With heart and mind our grace for to comfort.
The Empreour than considering in his mind.
How their four men to sic thingis was Inclinde
And knew richt weill that into Romes Cietie
Greit sowmes of gold was hid richt quietly.
Quhairof he culd get na perfect knawledge,
Except sit men as their he had in wage.
Sa couetice and gredynes of geir,
Haistie credence, quhilk all men should forbeir.
Blindit his thocht, and causit his wittis foruey
Gart him ouir sone to their bidding obey.
And sa at schort the Empreour is aggreit,
With their four men, and faithfully them feit.
Quhome to he said, good schirs I will ow prufe
And gif e be sic men for my behufe
As e have said, e sall have good rewaird,
Ilk ane of ow but dout sall be ane Lord.
And Intreitit with thankis into my house
Amang my Lordis, with giftis glorious.
They said agane and pleis our Majesty
Na mair rewaird at our grace covet we
Bat the ane half of that we do obtene,
Under the eird, as sall be cleirlie seen:
Be our Ingine, our dreamis and our slichtis
Within few eiris we mark to me^d our michtis
The Empreour said go do as e devise,
Ze tak on hand ane honest Interprise.
Than said they all unto the Empreour,
This nicht my Lord gif it war our plesour:
To the eldest of us four to grant leif,
His cleue running the samin nicht to preif.
Be his awin dream quhat he can comprehend
And quhat thairof sall be the final end.
And thairefter we sall in dayis three,
Schaw to our grace thairof the verity.
Quhat it betakins, and quhat thairof sall cum.
To our pleasure e sall know all and sum.
The Empreour said, go to I am content,
Sa tuik good nicht, and all four forth yai went
Merry in heart, richt wonder blyith and glaid.
Sa good answer that they obtenit had.
Past forth that time in scorn and derisioun,
Believing weill the greit tower to get down.
Three dayis and nichts being past and compleit
Their four kest them with the Empreour to meis
The eldest said, and pleis our Nobill grace,
To pas with us, and we sall schaw the place
Quhair that ane twn of reid gold lyis hid
The Empreour said I will do as e bid.
Than haistelie they come unto the place
The eldest said and pleis our Nobill grace
As I believe their is of gold sa cleir,
Ane twn streik full in this place lyand heir.
Euin sa my dream to me forsooth it schew,
And I dout not bot we sall find it true.
Than they all four to delf they fell fra hand,
And as he said richt sa the gold they fand.
Quhilk gold befoir into the samin place
Them selfis had hid, ago bot ane schort spa^^
Zit not the les the Empreouris fantasy
Trowit they had found the gold in verity.
Quhilk quhen he saw he was richt wonder glaid
With mirrie cheir, and to them four he said.
Of this found gold the ane half e sall haut,
The other half I sall cause to ressaue.
The (...) dreamer said to the Empreour,
Now fallis to me, gif it be our plesour,
My nicht about to dream gif I can find,
Any mair gold, gif sum be left behind.
The Empreour said god send ow sic furthera^ce
As this Ilk day our brother gat throw chance
The nixt nicht come, and siclike did the day,
This nixt dreamer to the Empreour can say.
Be of comfort, and gif it pleis our grace,
This nicht I dreamit of mair gold in ane place
Quhilk in schort time our nobil grace sal know
And godwilling the same sall to ow schaw.
And sa he did, quhairof he was richt bl^ith,
Quhome to glaidlie thempreour said full swyith
Tak our awin part, and I sall tak the other,
For e have done als weill as did our brother.
Sa did the third on the samin Ilk wise,
Alswa the fourt tuik the same Interprise.
Ilk ane of them fand to the Empreour
Ane twn of gold, with riches and treasour.
They causit the King to them give confidence
As they had found the gold be their science
Them selfis did hide that gold under the ground
And causit all trow the same that yai had found
The Empreour sa with gold he was begylit,
And with their slicht and science was ouirsylit.
Notwithstanding the ane half he them gave
Na wayis traisting that he should them dissaue.
And quhen ather of them had taken their part
The Empreour was richt Jocund in his heart.
He them auancit, and said yai war may true
Of suithsayaris, that ever he it knew:
And may expart into their awin science,
That ever was, be his Intelligence.
They persauing the Empreour was content
Of their doingis, they said with ane consent,
My Lord we have Ilk ane our nicht about,
Dreamit our dreams, quhilk e have hard but dout
Of very treuth, and hes preuit in deid
Zit farthermair will e thoill us proceid,
That we all four togidder dream this nicht
Sa sall our dream have the mair stre^th and micht
We traist gif their within this Cietie be
Any hid gold, greit Jowellis or money,
We sall it have be our dreams and Ingine,
Thocht it war hid ane thousand eiris sine.
Quhairthrow our grace salbe enrichit with gold,
That our compair sall not be on the mold.
And we dout not, bot richt weill vnderstandis
That their is gold ten thousand of thousandis
Within the wallis hid of the same Cietie,
Quhairof but dout good knawledge get sall we
The Empreour said go to I am content,
Sa that e find quhair their is gold and rent.
They tuik good nicht all four and said adieu
Except the^ selfis was nane their minves knew
Sa on the morn approaching the nynt hour,
They come all four befoir the Empreour.
Quhome to they said with gudlie countenance
My Lord be blyith, for we have good tythance.
For we all four hes dreamit this samin nicht
Intill our sleip we have seen sic ane sicht,
Of birnand gold sa wonder greit plenty
So much at anis I trow few saw with E^*
Will e suffer the samin to be socht
To our profeit but baid it sal be brocht.
Than sall e have of gold sic abundance,
That all the world for gold sall ow auance.
Of the greit Tower (quod they) into the ground
All this riches of gold is to be found.
The Empreour said the greit God me defend,
To sic ane wark that I never Intend.
The michtie tower quhair yt the Image standis,
For to put down with any mennis handis.
Quhilk was buyldit be Clerkis sa bounteous,
Sa done coistlie of sowmes sa sumpteous,
Als warnis us be their small bellis ringing.
Of enemeis gif they be vprysing.
Of all Regiounis outher be far or neir,
Gif they pretend aganis us to make weir.
Thairfoir I can be na way give consent,
To steir that tower for any gold or rent.
They said my Lord have e not found all true,
That we all four in any sort ow schew.
He said our wit and science I commend,
And als our treuth surely I will defend.
Also our craft, our lawtie and honor,
Bat I can not consent to (...)tche the tower:
Qu(...)k is to us greit consolatioun,
I will not thoill na way to put it down.
They said my Lord will e give us credence,
With our awin handis, and on our awin expense,
We sall not faill to obtene the treasour,
And in na sort thairby to hurt the tower,
Nor Images, nor it the bellis that ringis,
To save all sic we can do sindrie thingis.
We sall it do sa quyetlie in the nicht,
Nane bot we four thairof sall get ane sicht.
Gif it be done on daylicht patiently,
The pepill than should cry out oppmlie,
And rumor rise, out throw the haill Regioun,
That e for gold should tak the greit tower down.
We sall wirk sa that nouther ground nor tower
Sall thoill distres or it tak displesour.
The Empreour said quhen all folkis ar at rest,
To find the gold go do as e think best.
And I the morn sall cum and vesie ow,
Quhat gold e get, and quhair e wirk and how
Tak their my King for ane takin expres
Within the tower that e get glaid entres.
Their four come on at eum quhen it was lait,
Unto the tower they make the neirest gait.
Callit the Capitane, the King unto him schew,
Quha said to them, the King richt well he knew
He them inquirit quhat was their greit credence
And they him schew the haill taill and sentence.
And sa at schort their four fell to labor,
To pyke and holk, and, undermine the Tower.
Quhill it had nouther power, strenth nor micht
Within three dayis vnfallin to stand up richt.
This being done, on the third morn or day,
They lap on horse, and priuelie staill away:
To their awin land with greit blythnes and Joy
That fand the cast that greit Tower to d^stroy,
Bot or they wan forth of sicht of the town,
They stood all four and saw the tower fall down.
Sa on the morn quhen all folk did up rise,
They saw the tower was fallin on sic ane wise.
The Senatouris thairof tulk discomfort,
To the Empreour the fassoun culd report.
And said good Lord, how hes occurrit this case
That our greit Tower is fallin in sa schort space
Quhilk daily was our watch and comforting
Contrair our fais, and maid us ay warning.
He answerit them to me their come four men,
Quhilk of befoir I never did them ken.
And schew to me that they war suithsayaris,
Bot now I se that they a^ all greit dissaueris.
And swoir for treuth, and also to me schew,
Throw yair dreaming quhair gold was hid pai knew
And gart me trow wtin the towris ground
Ane thousand milliou^ of reid gold should be found
And not hurting the Tower nor it Image,
To do the same I gave them gudelie wage.
And sa to them I gave ouir greit credence
Quhairthrow is fallin greit Inconvenience.
They answerit him for our greit couatice,
Zour gredynes and birnand avarice,
And for our lufe to gold and greit delight,
That e thairof had sit ane appetite.
Sall we thairfoir be all destroyit at anis
Nay, the first wraik sall fall upon our banis.
But mair process to the Tolbuith him led,
And on his bak they kest him in ane bed,
And powrit his mouth of meltit gold their fow
Saying to him tak the aneuch of it now.
Thou covet gold with sa gredie desire,
Thou hes us tynt and all the haill Impire.
Fulfill thy lust of gold quhilk thou sall have,
This being done, they put him quick in grave.
For gredynes of gold this was his end,
Quhilk at his deid ane myte micht not him me^d
Not lang after come on their Kingis three,
All in w^irfair, with prepotent arnue,
Knawing richt weill the tower was cassin down
And sa they laid ane greit seige to the town,
Quhilk they ouircome, and kest down clean ye wall
And sa at schort Rome was destroyit all.
The Empress said have e taken weill my Lord
Their wordis in heid that I now did record,
Thankis ow forsooth, thairfoir Madame said he
For e have tald ane nobill taill to me.
Than culd scho say this tower with the Image
Betakins nocht bot their awm personage.
For ^u^k sa lang as e leif in this life,
Their is na Kings that dar raise weir nor strife
In our contrair, or it within our land,
Sa lang as e is now on life leuand.
And that our sone dois wonder weill considder
With the counsall of his Masters togidder.
With their falls taillis and feneit narratioun,
How they sall find the way to put ow down.
Ouir greit pleasure to heir them ay e have,
And their mind is but dout ow to dissaue.
As their four men this Tower to ruin brocht,
Their Masters sa wald bring ow eu^ to nocht
And undermine and cast ow under fute,
This is the cause they daily to ow suit.
The Images that sa greit money coist,
Is our five wittis, quhilk they believe is loist.
For sa barnelike and soft they ow persaue,
The haill Impire fra ow sa wald they have.
The Empreour said that Ilk taill that e sell,
I persaue weill may be tald be my sell.
Thairfoir they sall not make of me the tower,
Nor it change me as did that Empreour.
All is falset that they deill with I se,
Thairfoir the morn my Sone sall hangit be
The Empress said, will e our Sone gar haug
Ze salbe blyith fair weill and als leif lang*
Sa the nirt day the Empr^our gave command,
To tak his Sone and hang hun up fra hand.
To the Gallous as they war him leidand,
The Fyft Master come forth the way rydand.
To the Palice he raid hard at the poist,
For feir and dreid that the Child should be loist.
Quha come lawlie befoir the Empreour
And on his kneis him hailsit with honor.
Quha wryit his face, and wald not on him luik
Bot at him greit Indignatioun tuik.
My Lord he said it is not our honor,
My pure hailsing to tak in displesour.
Thy cu^ming heir * quod he) I covet nocht,
Nor thy hailsing, nor nane that heir it brocht.
For e have seruit at my hand all to die,
For displesure that e have done to me.
He said my Lord I never did the deid
Unto our grace, to get si^ to my meid.
As for our Sone, quhair e say he is dum,
We reckin that unto our greit wisdom.
As e will se heirefter in few dayis,
As to our wife quhair e allege and sayis:
Be her sayingis that he wald her eschamit,
But don't thairof he aw not to be blamit.
For weill I wait thairof he is wyteles,
As is my self, and of the same saikles.
Thairfoir my Lord sic thing believe e nocht,
For the contrair to ^^cht it sall be brocht.
For our Sone is to vertew sa Inclinde,
I wait sic vice was never in his mind.
And gif e will for our wifes wilful sawis,
^udo our Sone without process of Lawis.
It salbe worse to ow nor ever was
To the Doctor and cunning Ypocras.
That causit sla the Doctor Galiene,
His Cousing deir Master of Medicine.
The Empreour said, Master tell me that taill
Perchance it may for our cunning auaill.
The Master said, gar call our Sone agane,
And all the suith I sall schaw ow in plane.
Unto our grace gif I tald my narratioun,
In the mean time our sone should suffer passiou^
The Empreour than he causit his seruands pas
And put his sone in presoun quhair he was.
And sa that day he chaipit fra the Gallous,
The Master tha^ tald forth his tail as followis

The Quenis taill sum thing we mon declair.
MORALITAS.
SAY e not bot this Nobill Queen
That ay befoir sa good hes been
Callit her Lord falls befoir his Ene, said oppi^lie
That he of falset was not clean, reid e and se.
In the beginning of her last Taill
Quhair ^e should have the honor haill
Judge e gif scho did till him faill, in her langage
To call ^ir King sa vile ane thing, with greit outrage.
Bot women hes sic conditioun,
Quhen they ar noyit to want ressoun
They spout than like ane Scorptoun by ordour clean
Because quyte gane is discretioun, as did this Queen.
Alswa the Empreour far did faill
Sum hid conditiouu of small auaill
Quhilk that he maid be his counsel, to their consent
Forsooth ane King should wirk nathing, but auisement.
Sa was seen of the casting down
Of the greit tower of Romes town
Quhair he maid preuie compactioun, that nane did know
With uncouth men of strange Natioun, as deid did schaw.
Ze Lordis and Lairdis of greit honor
Do not as did this Empreour
Put all his hope into creasour, and greit riches
And loist his life within ane hour, for gredynes.
His gredynes sa weill was kend
It walkit to the warldis end
His fais quhome to he did offend, gat wit expres
How his plesour was in treasour, and gredynes.
Belyue they fand ane quick Ingine
Send him ane subtell hid propine
Quhilk causit him his honor tine, in schort process
And put all Rome to greit ruin, for gredynes.
For strangeris come with their vain wind
And falls flattery maid him sa blind,
Sic gold and treasure they should find, throw subtelnes
That they sa said he was richt glaid, for gredynes.
They schew him they had sic science
In dreaming sic experience
Of gold to get sic confluence, be besines
Bot he gave ouir haistie credence, for gredynes.
Quhilk causis greit mischief to be
As we may weill persaue and se
Gettis may credence quba best can lie, throw wickitues
Of half ane taill they will make three, for gredynes.
And can bring ane taill of nocht
And say the thing that never was wrocht
Nor never said nor never thocht, of wilfulnes
Sum give it credence euin as it docht, for gredynes.
And euin sa did the Empreour
Gave sic credence unto their four
To furneis gold and greit treasour, to his hienes
Gave them leif to cast down the Tower, for gredynes.
Quhilk ever was to Romes town
Sic comfort and consolatioun
Gif they thocht good to sum Regioun, they waid them dres,
Bot it the Tower was cassin down, for gredynes.
It is ane poysonit Pestilence
For to give ouir haistie credence
To ane taill not worth audience, throw haistines
The taill teller than tynes mence, for gredynes.
Their is money ma than anew,
Will make ane taill was never ^rew
Nor it them self it never knew, bot as they ges
Sum will say falls and after rue, for gredynes.
Their is diverse tynes their honor
Their worschip, riches, and plesour
Often times in vain makis greit laubour, with small Incres
And often is ordorit by good ordour, for gredynes.
For gredynes causis greit grief
Inuy, Malice, and mischief
Money for Muttoun and for Beif, into mirknes
Is hangit like ane commoun theif, for gredynes.
Thairfoir good Schirs I hartlie pray ow
Cast gredynes on side far fra ow
With Jocund mind pas and ga play ow, in merynes
Their is na better charm I say ow, for gredynes.
Now their three Kingis quben they did heir
The Tower quhair of they stude sit feir
Was cassin down but scheild or speir, throw wilynes
In all haist maid them to the weir, for gredynes.
For first they fand ane wily way
For to put Rome in grett affray
And thocht they wald it first assay, to get entres
For they wald make it their first pray, for gredynes.
Beliue they come and seigeit the town
In all good haist the wallis brak down,
And put them selfis in possessioun, with all blyithnes
And fra the Empreour rest his Croun, for gredynes.
Now Schirs this is the fynall end
To gredynes quha will pretend
Quhen they can not them self defend be manlynes
Away with vengeance all dois wend, for gredynes.
Their is two pointis into this taill
Them to forbeir is good and haill,
The first is gredynes but faill, of gold and geir,
Haistie credence often times brewis baill, their two forbeir.
Ane reproach to the Empress.
OCATIVE Queen and cruel, and rute of all mischief,
O falls flesche faint and fruell, greit grounder of all grief.
Wyld rauins sall ryfe thy beif, wod dogis thy banis sal gnaw
Or ever thou get releif, thy luddis sall thoill the Law.
We sall gar all man know, and als perfytelie se
Thy deidis the treuth sall schaw of thy hid harlatrie.
The Taill of the Fyft Master.
BEfoir this time ane Phisitioun their was,
Ane cunning Clerk, and namit Ypocras.
Quhilk in Physic and other heich science,
Ouir all other he had preeminence.
Als had with him ane kinsman of his awin
Callit Galiene quhais cunning was weil knawin.
All his Ingine and wit he did apply,
To leir Physic, and the same occupy.
As his uncle at sic times had befoir,
Quhairthrow he wan greit honor, laud and gloir
Bot in so much Galiene was not sa ald,
Zit he excellit his uncle monyfald:
In Physic airt, and into Medicene,
He was mair schairp and quicker of Ingine.
Than Ypocras persauing in his heart,
That Galiene in craft was sa expart,
Oreiding thairfoir that he should him excel,
And fra his gloir and profeit him expel.
And thairfoir hid als mekill as he micht
Fra Galiene, of the craft hid the slicht.
Than Galiene this weill he did persaue,
Rest him daily the mair and mair to have
Of Physic airt the mair he did obtene,
On day mair than befoir in fyftene.
Quhairby the Doctor tuik in his consait,
That Galiene should grow to greiter stait.
Thairfoir at him he had lurking Inuy,
How beit he had na querrell cause nor quhy.
In this mean time the King of ^ngarie
Send his message with schippis throw the si^
For Ypocras that he micht with him speik,
And cure his sone that lay richt wonder seik
Sa Ypocras the message did ressaue,
Harthe praying the messingers him to have
Sum part excusit unto their Nobill King,
For he for eild micht make na traveling.
Bot I sall send my Cousing and seruand,
Quhat I will bid, that he sall tak on hand.
Sa Galiene obeyit his uncles will,
And in all pointis the same he did fulfill.
And past his way unto that Nobill King
Quha was richt blyith and glaid of his cu^ming.
Bot he meruellit quhy come not Ypocras.
Galiene said that auld and waik he was
Micht not travel, for na travel he vsit,
Praying his grace for to hald him excusit,
And at that time had besines ado,
That he na way as than micht cum him to.
Bot in his steid he hes me to ow send,
With help of God our Sone sone sall I mend
Of the quhilk thing the King was weill cont^^
Than Galiene unto the Child he went,
Felt his Punsis and als his Drine saw,
Quhairby belyue his seiknes he did know.
Incontinent than past he to the Queen,
And said Madame, our seik Sone I have seen
And I am cum unto our Nobill grace,
Beseiking ow to heir me speik ane space.
Tak na disdain, thocht I now to ow speik,
I come to heill our Sone that lyis seik.
Scho said good Schir say on quhat plesis ow,
For e will say nocht bot the treuth I trow,
He said Madame tell on and make na lie
Quha is the Father of our Sone tell to me?
Quha his Father (quod scho) quha bot yt King?
Quod he Madame, their is not sic a thing.
Will e say so (quod scho) for verity,
Zeis want the heid I vow richt haistelie.
Anis I said ellis, and it I say agane,
This King is not his Father in certane.
I come not heir thairfoir to lois my heid,
Nor it Incur in my fault any feid.
Nor I have not deseruit sic rewaird,
Thocht I nane get, nathing I that regaird.
Sa to the dure he maid him straicht away*
The Queen that saw, and till him can scho say.
O good Master sa e will keip secre
I will ow schaw, sa e discover not me.
Than Galiene said, Madame God me defend,
Bot I sa do unto my lives end.
Thairfoir to me, to schaw the treuth be bald,
For it agane sall never mair be tald,
In greiter thing our grace sa sall I pleis,
Zour sone make haill, and put him weill to eis.
Gif e sa do, good Master than scho said,
Ze will make me richt wonder blyith and glaid.
Ane good rewaird of me sa sall e have,
And of my Lord siclike e will not crave.
Thairfoir heir me till I have said sum thing
Upon ane time come to my Lord and King
The King of Burgon, to pas the time with sport
Quhat will e mair to make my taill now schort
To ow Master, as now I will not lie,
With me he gat this child in priuetie.
Than Galiene said, feir not and speik no moir
The taill I knew richt perfitelie befoir.
Than to the Child he past Incontinent,
And did him cure with ane richt Regiment.
Quhat he should drink, and quhat should be his meit
Water to drink, and beif daily to eit.
Sa Galiene than within dayis three,
The Child maid haill of his Infirmity.
Quhen that the King hard tell his sone was fre
Of all seiknes, and of all Malady.
To Galiene ane good rewaird he gave,
Bot he the dowbill fra the Queen did ressaue.
With special thankis, and after ay credence,
Sa tuik his leif, and hamewart he past hence.
Quhen he come hame to his Eme Ypocras,
At Galiene but tarry culd he as:
How is the Child that e past for to se?
Schir he is haill of all seiknes, said he.
Than Ypocras Inquirit him to conclude,
Quhat he him gave to his drink and his fude.
He said he gave him orin flesche co eit,
Water to drink, this was his drink and meit.
Than Ypocras to Galiene said fra hand,
The Mother is not true to her husband.
Than Galiene said, now Master suith e say,
With displesour Ypocras past his way.
Said to him self with haitrent and Inuy,
Weill I persaue na man will set me by
Within schort time, be na remedy found,
Bot quyte to nocht my cunning is confound.
Be his cunning he sall not faill to be,
Praisit in his wark ten times abone me.
And or sa war, without I fand remeid,
Rather I sall conspire my Cousingis deid.
Fra that time forth Ypocras ay him dressed,
How he micht get Galiene deid and suppressed.
In a morning Ypocras up can rise,
Past to his Barth, as his use was and gise.
To Galiene said with wordis fair and meik,
Now let us go in our garding and seik
Herbs to be salf, that is of may vertew,
For as I wis their is growing anew.
Master he said. I am reddy at hand,
Quhat e pleis best to do as e command.
Ypocras said tak up that herb sa grene,
For it is full of vertew as I wene.
And sa he did at his Masters command
He pullit the herb, and gave it in his hand:
And at his nois the sawer thairof did smell,
This herb (said he) of herbis beiris the bell.
Stoup down agane and pull up be the rute,
Of it I sall vaith profeit get and fruit,
For I know weill it is richt wonder gud^
To evil Fever, and to stem rynning blude
Als of vertew it is richt comfortiue,
To heill all Flux to any man on live.
Sa Galiene na Ill having in mind,
To pull the rute lawlie he did Inclinde.
Quhilk wald not draw a lang time with his hand
Than Ypocras abone him he culd stand,
And with his knife he struik him to the heart:
Cause in science he thocht him ouir expart.
Sone after this Ypocras tuik seiknes,
Be want of blude, and of corpse febilnes.
Than kest his buikis, and socht his awin science,
Him self to help he culd get na defense,
Than his Scollers in all haist come him till,
And to him said Master quhat is our will,
He bad them bring ane ^wn of water fow,
With ane wo^mill a hundredth hoillis boir throw
Quhen that was done their went na water out
Than Ypocras said to them Schirs but dout,
This is the wraith of leuing God sa hie,
That this mischance hes sufferit fall on me.
As e may se, and wonder weill persaue,
For all is Just and worthy that I have.
And as e se their is into this twn
Ane hundredth hoillis with Irins out throw run
Throw all their hoillis their gais not out a drop
Bot as e se dois both stand still and stop,
Quhilk to nature is contrair every deill,
Quhairby e may all understand richt weill.
Richt sa their herbis for heill that e gif me,
May nathing help to my Infirmity.
Thairfoir quhat ever e tak upon me cure,
It helpis nathing e may be verray sure,
For weill I wait as now is na remeid,
Bot for my mis I mon now bide the deid.
Bot war Galiene my Neuo now leuand.
He wald not faill to make me haill fra hand.
Quhome I did kill throw malice and Inu^,
Bot of that deid, richt sair repent now I.
Thairfoir God hes be his Just ordinance,
Send upon me this haistie sair vengeance.
As he sa said na ma wordis than he tald,
Bot turnit his bak, and up the gaist he ald.
The Master said, hes our grace done consaue,
The sempill wordis thar to ow schawin I have
The Empreour said weill I persaue the case,
That Galiene was killit be Ypocras.
To Ypocras quhat hurt micht it have been,
Quhat greit honor had cum to Galiene.
The Master said it micht be good at all,
Gif Ypocras to seiknes had been thrall.
Than Galiene perchance micht found remeid,
And at that time he should not sufferit deid.
Thairfoir because him self be Ill Jutent
Killit and put down the verray Instrument:
Quhilk wald have him supportit in this stres,
Ze may persaue in God the greit gudnes,
And richt Judgeme^t, that sa dull maid his heart.
That he culd not him self help be na Art.
Thairfoir my Lord it is euin sic ane case.
Betuir our sone and our awin Nobill grace
And gif our sone for our wifes word e sla

Quhen he is deid, e sall wary our weird,
And wald be fane to seart him out of eird.
Quhen e ar auld and may not help our sell

Thairfoir give not sic credence to our Quche,
Scho will dissaue our grace quhen e leist wene
Considder weill this is our secund wife,

Amang them all it e sall never have
Sa wise ane Sone nane of them sall consaue
Sa verteous in wit dois mair precell,
And in our eild will save ow fra perrell.
The Empreour said, for that e tell to me.
Surely this day my Sone he sall not die.
Bot I persaue and wonder weill dois mark.
That women been richt crafty in their wark.
And richt subtell for to tyist any man,
As they think good, bot not the les quhat than.
For my aw(...) saik this day he sall not die,
Quhen I have neid I wait he will help me.
The Master said, I thank our nobill grace,
Sa tuik his leif and past hame to his place.
Quhen that this tail was tald to the Empres
Gif scho was blyith the auditouris may ges.
Scho schew her self in mind Impatient,
All that her saw, beleuit that scho had went
Quyte out of mind, and as ane body mad,
And her five wittis clean tynt away scho had.
All that her saw had piety of her cheir,
Scho schoutit sa, that all the place micht heir
Sum of the Lordis to the Empreour can ga
And schew to him that it stude with her sa.
They said my Lord without e find remeid,
Zour Empress will her awin self put to deid.
Quhome to he past, and speirit at her quhairfoir
Every day e murne ap moir and mair.
Scho said my Lord I meruell in ane part,
That I birst not, and in two brekis my heart.
I know I am the dochter of ane King,
And than our wife, quhilk is ane greiter thing
In all my dayis sufferit I not sic schame,
As I have done, sen I come to ow hame.
And ever mair e promeis me ane mendis,
And as e do, God and the world it kendis.
The Empreour said I wait not quhat to do,
Nor to quhat side is best to turn me to.
For day be day e seik my Sonnis deid,
And his Maisteris, thairof they seik remeid.
He is my Sone, that I believe and know,
Bot I can not the verity it schaw:
Quhidder I sall to ow gif mair credence,
Than the Maisteris with all their greit science
Ze tell ane taill quhilk I think good and fair,
And they ane other, to ouris is plat contrair.
The Empress said that is the verray thing
That troubillis my heart, and causis my murning
Because e gif them ay the mair credence,
And to their taill takis greiter attendence,
Nor to my taill, quhilk tellis the verity,
Quhilk e sall sair repent it or e die.
And in few dayis e will get sic rewaird,
As did aue King ressaue fra his Steward.
The Empreour said, than tell me that taill sone
Perchance our will thairefter may be done.
Scho said I sall begin with diligence,
Bot I pray ow to gif me audience.
With peirt visage and countenauce richt haill.
On this fassoun began to tell her taill.

Ypocras clean I discommend
Ever in heart for to pretend
Sa far to Galiene offend, as him to ^^a
Bot he repentit at his end, that he did sa.
The principal cans heirof find I
That Ypocras had sa greit Inuy
At Galiene, this was the quhy, that Galiene was
Mair firm and stabill, in craft mair abill, nor Ypocras.
Ypocras should have had plesour
That Galiene gat any honor
For he was Galieues Doctor, thhairfoir say I
He should have borne to him favor, and not Inuy.
Bot God of his greit Equity
Wald not thoill sic vnpuneist be
Quben Ypocras was in point to die, all his cunning
Old not than help him worth ane fle, at his ending.
He said had Galiene been leuand,
He culd have helpit him fra hand,
Bot he wist weill it was the wand, that God had send
^im sic distres, and greit seiknes, that nane culd mend.
The ^id Inuy and greit haitrent,

Inuy and cheritie ar contrair
They can not in ane place repair
Quhair cheritie is, ay God is their, withouttin faill
Inuy was, and is ever mair, with brief and baill.
It is the fountain and the flude
Of ^chedding of all Innocent blude,
And is contrair to all good, and is the rute
Inuy thairfoir sall never gloir, of Joy the fruit.
Agustiue discriues Inuy to be
A man to have sturt Inwartlie
Of his Nichtbouris Felicity, withouttin raus
The quhilk is contrait cheritie, and Goddis Lawis.

Inuidia diaboli mors intrauit in orbem. Sapi. 2.
The Sext Taill of the Empress.
BEfoir this time their was ane michtie King
Prydefnll in heart and proud abone all thing
He was sa heich and prydefull in his thocht,
All other men he set them clean at nocht.
This King he thocht all Rome for to destroy,
The Romany sla, and after to conuoy
To his Kingdom, the deid banis of their two,
Peter and Paull, with money Relics mo.
To waist that town, and put it all to sack,
Bot his purpois was sum thing put abak.
Intill his face was sa disfigurait,
In sic ane sort, that every kind of stait,
Abhorrit sa, his vgsum foull visage,
That nane covet to tuitche his personage.
Sa handillit was with sic Infirmity,
With Lippernes, ane fouller nane culd be.
Zit his nature raise on him with sic rage,
To have women he gave ane greit curage.
Sa callit he his Steward quyetlie,
And schew to him his counsall secreithe.
Saying my friend, this thing I will ow schaw
All women kind abhorris me as e know,
That I can get of them na company,
Quhilk gif I had, war greit pleasure to me.
He said my Lord and pleis our Nobill grace,
Howbeit e be deformit in the face:
Ze have aneuch of good money and gold,
For to conduce the fairest on the Mold.
Thairfoir I say e neid not in na sort
Of fair women to wanc the greit comfort.
Than said the King se for na coist e spair,
To get me ane that is bricht fresche and fair:
Howbeit e gif ane thousand Crowns thairfoir
And or I want e sall gif mekill moir.
The Stewart said I sall do that I may,
To fill our will, and sa he come his way.
Thinking in mind blindit with couetise
Their thousand Crowns may I get on this wise
Win to my sell, and to my wife alone,
And sa hame wart to his wife is he gone.
Quha was richt fair, bowsum with all beauty,
Verteous and good, richt plesand for to se,
Prudent, perfect, with countenance richt glaid,
With covetous heart to her their wordis he said.
O my good wife, my Souerane Lord the King
Hes chargeit me with ane richt secreit thing.
To have women he is richt covetous,
At his pleasure, and wonder desirous.
Quhilks for na coist he sayis he will not want,
And charges me ane thousand Crowns to grant
To any persoun that will the same ressaue,
Botfor ane nicht with him her for to have.
Thairfoir in mind my self I have compest,
Betuix us two, I think this be the best
The thousand Crowns to purches to our sell.
Sa e will use, and follow my counsel.
Scho said good Schir our counsall I will do
Sa to na sin nor schame it turn me to.
He said e sall pas to the Kingis bed,
Quhilk is with silk and claith of gold ouirspred
And their all nicht ly with him quyetlie,
At his pleasure, as he thinkis best to be.
That it is e, their is na man sall ken,
Bot I alone, the quhilk abone all men
Should saif our schame and als our honesty,
Thairfoir as schame to ow it can not be.
Allace scho sayis good Schir is that our will,
By our body, my womanheid to spill:
With ane Lipper, and sa deformit in face,
Schir change our mind for him that gave all grace
I wait it is nouther our thocht nor mind
To sic ane deid my heart for to Inclind:
Bot me to preif, and to tempt my Intent,
Gif I thairto wald any sort consent.
O my good wife howbeit he Lipper be
And in the face deformit as e se.
And foull of flesche, and also foull of blude,
Zit than the gold is wonder sweit and good.
Scho said agane my sweit husband persaue
How beit the gold be good and sweit to have,
And thocht he war the clenest man thairont,
May fair of face, gentill, courts and stout.
Wald e that I committit sic ane sin,
Aganis my God, any gold for to win?
I will not dude, thairfoir hald me excusit,
Charge me na mair, for heir quite I refuse it.
Quhome to he said with ane richt austeir luik,
How purpois e my company to bruik.
That thing I will to preis for to ganestand,
Ze ar ouir peirt to contrair my command,
It is my will, and that same salbe done.
Thairfoir make ow that Ilk to compleis sone.
Do e it not, I vow betuix us tway
Sall never be ane blyith nor Joyful day,
Bot ever mair in chyding and in grief,
Quhilk at the last will turn to ane mischief.
Know e not weill to the Kirk quhen e went,
Ze swoir e should be ay obedient,
To me alone, as wedlok us declairis,
Ze Schir scho said in all lefull effairis:
Not displesing my maker King of Kingis,
I will obey ow in all other thingis.
I ow command be vertew of that aith,
Quhilk for to brek e should be wonder laith.
Considdering it is my mind and will,
Without ganesay my bidding e fulfill.
And to the same richt sone that e consent
Or I auow richt sair e sall repent.
In the mean time as he their wordis schew,
Out of his scheith his quhinar forth he drew.
Scho trimbling sair for greit dreddour and feir
Forth of that steid ane step scho durst not steir.
Persauing weill his cruelty and boist,
And in greit dout her life for to be loist.
The Impatience and the greit gredynes,
The cruel mind and als the crabitnes
Of this Ill man this woman did attend,
Quhilk in na sort nor fassoun culd amend.
Scho was constranit quhat for dreddour and aw,
For to consent to his command and saw.
Scho said good man our bidding I mon do,
Bot greit God knawis gif my will be thairto.
Bot I appeill fra all consent of sin,
That may follow, or in this case cum in.
And on our self all haill I lay the charge,
And befoir God thairof I me discharge.
Than the Stewart but any tarying
Past in all haist and said unto the King:
I have ow gottin ane woman richt famous,
Gentill, courts, and cum of ane good house.
Fair and weill fauourit, richt plesand for to se,
And scho mon cum to ow richt quyetlie:
Within the nicht scho mon cum lait at eine,
Bot me alone, with nane scho will be seen
Airlie at morn befoir the Sone rising,
Fra ow siclike scho mon make departing.
For this scho will ane thousand Crowns have,
And for payment bot me nane will scho crave,
Than said the King of that I am content,
As e have done thairto I weill consent.
Withouttin mair the Stewart he hes led
His awin spousit wife unto the Kingis bed,
And with the key the dure he hes maid fast,
But any noyis, and sa his way is past.
Airlie at morn in dawing of the day:
The Steward raise, and to the King can say,
My Souerane Lord and pleis our Nobill grace
It will be day within ane pretty space.
I think it good that woman e let go,
For I promeist that our grace should do so.
Than said the King this woman plesis m^
Sa wonder weill as it her company,
I will not want nouther for gold nor geir,
This hour to cum I will not let her steir.
Quhen he that hard, he was richt wonder woe
And fra the dure with sorry heart did go.
Within ane quhile but tarp come agane,
And to the King he said Schir for certane,
The day is licht, and that woman present,
And with the folk scho will be schamelie schent.
And my promeis to her quyte I have brokin.
For not keiping to her that I have spokin.
Than said the King, na way it sall scho pas,
For scho sall have of me quhat scho will as.
Thairfoir Stewart I say to ow in plane,
Go pas our way and lok the dure agane.
The Stewart than richt sorrowful in heart.
Upon neid force to the dure did depart.
Went up and down, and wist not quhat to say,
The Sone was heich, and weill gane of y^ day,
He come agane and said unto the King,
It is two houris after the Sone rising.
That woman will be schent withouttin dout,
With all the folk and pepill heir about.
The King answerit, nathing of him content,
I ow command that e our self absent:
Unto the time that I pleis for to rise,
For vnrequyrit e have me troublit thrice.
And my pleasure is with this company,
Thairfoir pas on, at this time let me be.
The Stewartis heart gif it was than on steir,
As I believe their neidis na man to speir.
Zit not the les he culd not keip counsel,
For all his wit he wald discriue him sell.
Incontinent without mair auysing,
With sorry heart he said unto the King.
O my good Lord, I oppin to ow my heart,
That Ilk woman e will not thoill depart
Without license, scho is my weddit wife,
Now in our hands lyis both my deid and life
The King hard that and thocht all was not richt
Opinit windois and saw the fair day licht.
Saw the woman quha was lusty in face,
Ane word not spak ane Pater noster space,
Sine saw it was ^uin as the Stewart said,
Quhairof he was richt sorry and not glaid.
Quhome to he said O thou may schamefull knaif
How durst thou be sa peirt me to dissaif.
And me to cause thy wife for to abuse,
Thy gredie heart thy self it sall confuse.
Quhy hes thou causit thy wife unwillingly
Cum in my bed to me vnwittandlie.
For ane small sowme of money and riches
To schame thy self for thy greit gredynes.
Knew thou not weill withouttin any fabill,
My malady was ever Incurabill
That was in the thou hes done I declair,
Thy self, thy wife, to undo ever mair.
Thairfoir pas swyith in haist out of my sicht,
N^r in my realm that thou bide not four nicht
And fra hence forth gif ever I may the sie,
Ane schamefull deid I auow thou sall die.
Incontinent he past fra his presence,
And never saw the King fra that time hence.
Quyte of his Realm fra them he did him dres
That Ilk rewaird he gat for gredynes.
This being done, the King in all his dayis,
Held up this wife, as the history sayis:
In greit worschip, and gave to her eirlie,
Ane sowme of gold to keip her honestly.
After that time I do not find nor reid
With this woman that he had actual deid.
Sone after this the King causit to conuene
Ane greit army all cled in armor clean.
With greit puissance and nobill men of weir,
In all effairis, as to them culd effeir.
And went to Rome with greit power and micht
To seige the same the gait they held on richt.
And sa they did it seige on ather side,
That the Romany durst not thairin abide.
He seigeit it still sa sad and wonder sair,
That they within micht it defend na mair.
Sa at the last to ane counsall they went,
Thinking ya^ wald with y^ King tak pointme^t
Quhilk was for till deliver him at anis,
Of Peter and Paull the blist body and banis.
Quhilk was the cans of his greit erand their
For to obtene the same withouttin mair.
In the Cietie than their was still present
Seuin wise Maisteris that had the Regiment,
Of all the town, and nathing by them done,
Airlie at morn, at euin nor it at none.
And to their seuin the Cietizanis come to,
And said Maisteris greit thing we have ado.
We are compellit be force of one army
For to gif ouir and rander the Cietie
Unto their folkis quhilk ar our enemeis,
Or ellis for to deliver the bodeis:
Of good Peter, and Paull his halie brother,
On force we mon the ane do or the other.
The first Master agane to them he said,
My good nichtbouris tak na feir bot be glaid.
As for this day the Cietie I sall save,
With the wisdom and cunning that I have.
The secund said, the nixt day fallis me,
Fra enemeis for to keip the Cietie,
With my wisdom, and als my cleir cunniug.
For all the str^nth of one greit puissant King.
Sa did the thr^d and fourt withouttin dout,
The fyft, the sext, richt sa the seuint all out.
In like manner as their seuin Masters now.
Unto our Sone hes promeist do with ow.
In this mean time the King caus^^ his Army
Lay ane assault about the greit Cietie.
With sic awful and cruel Munitioun,
Quhill they war like for to obtene the town.
The first Master than he come to the King,
And with him fell in talk and commo^ing.
And talkit sa in sic manner and wise,
As for that day he gart his Army rise.
And fra the town the Seige abak he drew,
As for that day na mair they did perfew.
Bot on the morn the Seige agane they laid,
The nixt Master past to the King and said
In like manner as the other befoir,
And (...) that day they seigeit the town no moir.
Sa did they all, quhill it come to the last,
On the seuint day they seigeit the town sa fast,
It was beleuit the same they wald obtene,
Than all the town togidder did conuene.
All in ane voice to the s^uint Master sa(...),
About the town sa strange ane seige is laid,
That we believe nathing bot cruel deid.
Without that e find sum help and remeid:
Conform to the sayingis e said but dout,
That was Ilk ane to saif our day about.
And we are all Informit of surety.
The King hes maid his aith solempnitlie,
He sall not raise his seige nor Munitioun,
Unto the time that he obtene the town.
To ow Master now we can say no moir,
We wald e did as our fellowis befoir.
Quhome to he said, my freindis tak e na feir,
Be of comfort, and Ilk ane make good cheir.
The morn sall I with my wark and cunning
Skaill all one hoist, and also fray the King.
He salbe fane for all his greit puissance,
To pas away with his greit Ordinance.
They went their way, and na mair tuik in thocht
Bot all meruellit how sic thing culd be wrocht.
The morn airlie the seige was confirmit,
To have the town also the King determit.
This seu^nt Master to his Chalmer he went,
And cled him in ane nice abilement.
As Pacok ^aillis, and fedderis of all kin hew.
Partreid, part quhite, part allow grene and blew
Ane bricht drawin sword he tuik in every hand
On ane Tower heid he past up for to stand.
Quhilk was may heich of all the haill Cietie,
Foruentis the hoist, that they micht all him se.
The two bricht sword^s into his mouth he tuik
The same schynand, upon the army schuik.
Quhilis turnis eist, and other quhilis west.
Quh^ls south, quhyls north quhair yai micht se hi best
The schina^d swords agains y^ sone sa ble^t
With his cleithing and strange abilement.
They in the hoist richt weill and cleirlie saw,
Bot quhat it was na man of them did know.
All the greit Lordis quhen they beheld sic thing,
Half in effray they past all to the King:
And said O Lord, behald upon one Tower
Wes^ this day ane wonderful Figour.
Than said the King the same I do persaue,
Bot quhat it is, na knawledge I can have.
They said we know quhat thing it is but don't
It is Jesus down of the heum cum out:
Quh(...)k is the God of all one Christin folk.
And knawis richt weill how that we do prouok
His awsum Ire, and how we do pretend
To ^^a his folk, the quhilk he will defend.
Zone samin swords that e se schining sa,
They signify Ilk ane they will us sla,
Gif we langer into this field abide,
Our counsall is thairfoir hame that we ride.
The King heiring trunblit for verray feir,
Gart raise his hoist and all his men of weir:
And said it is better in time we fle,
Nor one their God with his swords gar^ us die
Than all the hoist in haist they maid the^ hame
Frayit without cause, with mekill scorn and schame
Howbeit to fle na perrell was nor neid,
Bot all dissait be the Masters falls deid.
Quhen the Romany persauit the Army fle,
Ilk auc they Ischit, and past of the Cietie.
With manly heart and gudlie countenance,
Followit the King for all his Ordinance.
Slew and destroyit all that they plesit that day
And quhome they list captive yat brocht away
And sa the King and all his greit Army
Brocht was to ground be the greit subteltie
Of this Master, quha wrocht all be dissait,
That with power na manner culd debait.
The Empress than said to the Empreour
This taill I tald it is under color.
Bot wald greit God this taill e understood
He said Madame, I think it wonder good,
In the first end (quod scho) I wait e hard,
Quhat I ow tald of the gredie Steward:
That the King trowit asweill as his awin life,
And it for gold he sauld his weddit wife.
And als him self was baneist the country,
Because the King fand him sa falls and sly.
In like manner our Sone for the desire
And appetite he hes to the Impire.
Now day be day it is his mind and thocht,
Zow to destroy, and bring ow unto nocht.
Bot now sa lang as e ar in our micht,
Do as the King did with the Stewart richt.
Gif e purpois not to sla him fra hand
Than baneis him, and als manesweir the land
That e and I quhilk is our weddit wife,
In time cu^ming that we may leid our life:
Also e hard how the King lay at Rome,
To win the same how that he did presume,
And was mockit be the Masters in plane,
He and his folkis war all put down and slane.
Zour seuin Masters into the samin wise,
Intendis ay to siclike Interprise.
With their falls taillis at end will ow dissaue,
That our falls sone all the Impire may have.
The Empreour said be na way that salbe,
The morn be time he sall not faill to die.
Incontinent he callit on his seruandis,
And to them all he gave sic strait commaudis,
That on the morn without Impediment,
On the Gallous but faill his Sone to schent.
This word beliue past out throw all the town,
Quhairat money maid lamentatioun,
That the Empreour for the wordis of his wife
Fra his ane sone should with schanie tak the life.
The (...) Master hard tell of this effray,
Lap on his horse withouttin mair delay.
Poistit fra hand unto the Empreour,
And hailsit him with reverence and honor.
Quha tuik the same verray unthankfully,
And said he seruit at his hand for to die,
And als his Sone quhome y^ yai had maid dum
They war ouir peirt in his presence to cum.
The Master said I serve not for to die,
Nor it our Sone, knew e the verity.
That he is dum quhair e allege and sayis,
Of that the treuth e sall know in few dayis.
Gif e him sla for it our wife can tell,
Of our wisdom than have I greit meruell.
And without dout it sall ow happin richt
As it happinnit sum time unto ane Knicht.
To his wyfes sawis gave sic fidelity,
That he was drawin out throw the haill Cietie
At ane horse taill, and hangit like ane theif,
His wifes sawis brocht him to sic mischief.
The Empreour said I pray the tell that taill,
The Master said Schir that I sall not faill.
Sa e will cause our Sone to cum agane,
And for this day e let him not be slane.
Incontinent the Empreour gave command,
To the presoun to leid his Sone fra hand.
And sa was done, the Master than but mair,
To tell his taill began this co declair.
The Doctouris taill farthermair or we heir.
Sum moral sense of the last let us leir.
MORALITAS.
THIS prydefull King, he culd not King
with measure and humility
He was sa proud, he thocht naue could
Compair to him their micht not be.
The Lord of aw, persauit and saw,
That his heart was sa proud and hie
He wald correct, him and Infect,
with plague and greit Infirmity.
Quhair their is pride, grace can not bide,
Out of that rowme beliue he rinnis
Intill all haist, as he war chaist,
To lawlynes to seik ane Innis.
The bricht Angel, for pride he fell,
In hell it still in pain ay winnis,
I say ow all, that man sall fall
His wark with pride always beginnis.
The wise man wrytes, quhair he Indytes
All beginning of Ill is pride,
And money ma sayis euin richt sa,
Into their wrytings dois not hyde.
Thairfoir the Lord, na way will cord
Quhair pride hes credence for to gyde
I ow declair, he scurges sair
For quhair pride is God will not bide.
Of his Justice, sic wickit vice,
He will not thoill vnpuneist be,
Be battle Pest, weir or wanrest
Sum perrellous plague or poverty
Hounger and skaut, fude for to want
Infectit with Infirmity
Thairfoir fle pride all time and tide,
And hald ow with humility.
Als in this taill, withouttin faill,
Greit couetice e may persaue
The false Stewart, that fand the Art
The King him self and wife dissaue,
Bot on him fell, the sorrow fell,
He was worthy the same to have
To be exylit, that King begylie,
I say for me he playit the knave.
That his a win wife, first fylit her life,
And syne her faull with deidlie sin,
Fie Stewart fie, was that thy quhy,
Sa fulischlie geir for to win
with couetice, and avarice,
At sic ane falls gait to begin
For gredynes to win riches,
Ouir money to the Devil wald rin.
Be commoun thift, sum makis their schift,
In this world quhill their life be endit,
To pluk the pure they tak na cure,
Quha hes na power to defend it.
Sum reif is and ruggis, sum drawis and druggis,
And purpois never to amend it,
Bot quhen its win, few of our kin,
Nor it our self perchance sall spend it.
Sa covetous, and desirous.
This Stewart was gold for to win,
He cairit nocht, for to have brocht
His wife to schame and deidly sin.
Quhidder he gat it, or nocht few wait it
For fra he and the King did twin
In deid I trow, to say to ow,
He had ane other wob to spin.
He charge it was, suith for to pas
Out of the Realm or be confound
His a win falset, snairit him in net,
His deid till him self did redound.
Bot quha wald make ane happy pak
Se falset thairin be not found
Lawtie and licht, schawis ay the richt,
On gredynes make not our ground.
Auaritia est inordinatus amor habendi, tullius.

As to this King that lay seiging,
And was sa frayit for Pacok taillis,
And two bricht swordis, with sum vain wordis,
without mair skaith his army skaillis.
His Camp to raise, and saw few fais,
I think they war bot snifland snaillis
The Potingair takis lytill cair
To cure the man that nathing aillis.
Ane King should ay, at sic assay
Have ane sad counsall him beside,
Perchance ane fray may make him pray
And gar him fle quhen he should bide,
Daft vaniteis, groundit with leis,
At all times he should let ouirslyde
Be circumspek, and in his nek
Ay have ane Ey all time and tide.
Haistie credence dois greit offense,
Gif it be in ane Conqueror,
Richt weill should be, auisit be,
To every taill to give answer.
Intreit his Lordis, as weill accordis
Than they will serve him with honor
with blyith visage, gar pay his wage,
He sall triumph and be victour.
Had he sa done, not half sa sone
He had not been sa lichtlie chaist
Bot the Doctor, upon the Tower
Maid him out of his mind amaist.
Captains and Kingis tent to sic thingis
To all traitillis e give na traift,
For gif e do, it will cum to,
As to the King that saw the Gaist.
Ane reproach to the Empress.
GOmorras graceles gyde, and Sodomes schameles seid,
Thou Beliallis bitrer byrd, both falls in word and deid.
Thy boist thou blawis on breid, sall not saif thee I say,
Thy ers brint in ane gleid, I think to se sum day,
Thou sall not sa away, thou commoun cursed Cowclink
Trowis thou to chaip nay, nay, I rather never drink.
The Taill of the Sext Master,
UPON ane time their was in Romes town
Ane Empreour of greit micht and Renoun.
Quha had greit Kingis into his company,
Lordis, Barrounis, Knichts, of greit Nobility
Doing service as culd them best effeir.
Sum for pastime and sum to stuf his weir.
He had three Knichts quhome he lude ouir ye laif
In all effarus mair credence to them gaif.
Ane other Knicht their was in the Cietie,
That had weddit ane lusty gay Lady,
As e have done, our Princes and our wife
Quhome he lufit asweill as his awin life.
This Lady culd make mirrie sing and dance,
In company scho culd make good pastance.
Wantoun oung men euin for that samin cause,
To her ludgeing all time of day scho drawis.
And at all times scho sang sa wonder sweit,
That every man that past upon the streit:
Had greit pleasure of her dulce melody,
And causit Ilk man covet her company.
Scho sang sa sweit, sa curious and cleir,
All had delight her singing for to heir.
And sa come by ane of the Knichtis three,
That the Empreour lufit sa Inwartlie.
And hard her sing with voice sa curious,
Trowit weill scho was ane Lady amorous.
He blent about, and saw quhair that scho set,
Incontinent he was taken in the net:
Of lufis rage, and of the Lady fair
Euin still he stude, and past na farther mair,
Quhill time he gat into her house entry,
And for ane time bure their good company.
Sa at the last he fell in commoning
With this Lady, of lufe and sit talking.
Sa Inwarthe at her he did Inquire,
Quhat scho wald have and fulfill his desire,
And sleip with him bot the space of ane nicht
Scho askit him ane hundredth Florens bricht.
He said Lady I will give ow na les,
Schaw me the time quhen I thairto sall dres.
Scho said good Schir at time convenient,
Quhen I think time e salbe after sent.
Sa Instantly that nicht he did depart,
And of his tryist was wonder blyith in heart.
Believing sure that scho should for him send,
Bot small he knew how all wald cum to end.
Sa on the morn scho sang into her bour,
Come the nixt Knicht pertenit the Empreour,
Saw this Lady, and hard her voice sa sweit,
Tuik greit langour quhil he culd with her meit
And sa he did, and schew to her his mind,
Unto the quhilk scho was richt weill Inclinde.
Quha promeist her of good Florens five scoir,
Scho said good Schir of ow I ask no moir.
He said Lady quhen sall I traist heirto
Ane good dew time I sall provide (quod scho)
Sa he as than departit mirrelie,
Traisting his tryist in all thing weill should be.
On the third day the third Knicht in like wise,
Come by her house and the same Interprise:
He tuik on hand and hecht to this Lady
Five scoir Florens of him should have reddy,
For to perform and satisfy his will,
Scho was content, and grantit weill thairtill.
Quhen sall I cum (quod he) I wald e schew.
I sall send word (quod scho) as I am true.
Sa all their three had gottin her consent,
Bot nane of them knew it vtheris Intent.
Than this Lady of all malice repleit,
To her husband scho said into secreit.
Secreit matters I have to ow till schaw,
Bot e alone na persoun sall it know.
And gif e will the samin tak on hand,
For greit profeit to us both it will stand.
And will releif us of all poverty,
In time cu^ming, and leif in honesty.
He faid good dame I can weill keip counsel,
Of any thing that e will to me tell.
To keip counsel it pertenis to ane man.
Bot be contrair, their is na woman can,
Of their counsel I reid anis in ane raill,
It is comparit to butter into Caill.
Zit not the les the suith gif e will schaw,
Quhat ever it be, their is na man sall know.
Quod scho it is ane thing of verity,
That may us hald ay into honesty.
Schaw me (said he) and I sall keip counsel,
Of all secreitis that e will to me tell.
At my power the same I sall fulfill:
Thairfoir schaw forth gif that it be our will.
Quod scho good schir yair hes been Knichts three
Heir diverse times desiring lufe of me,
And promeist me but dout ane good propine,
Ilk ane of them five scoir of Florens fine.
At sindrie times Ilk ane come quietly,
Not ane knawing of vthers preuitie.
Culd we this gold unknown get in our hand,
Into greit steid but dout it should us stand.
Than said the Knicht dame e say verity,
Bot of good zeill tell on how can that be.
Scho said good Schir my counsall e sall heir,
How e sall do, the way I sall ow leir.
I promeist them every man be him sell,
Quheu they sall cum, the time I should them tell,
In the same time at the et e sall stand,
Richt quietly with our drawin sword in hand
And quhen they cum into their ordour sa,
Ze sall not faill all three them for to sla.
Sa three hunder Florens we sall obtene,
And nane sall know, nor it the Knichts be seen.
Quhome to he said, O my belouit wife,
Should I for gold reif any man his life?
To do sic thing of God I stand sic aw,
And als it is contrair the Kingis Law.
And I dout not gif sic ane thing war done,
Withouttin dout it should be knawin sone.
Quod scho feir not, the deid I tak on hand,
To end it forth peirtlie their at sall stand.
And quhen he hard the taill than that scho tald,
It maid the man the mair hardy and bald.
Sa be counsall of this Ill wifes Intent,
Scho causit this Knicht to that slauchter consent
This Ill woman quhen cu^min was the nicht,
Incontinent scho send for the first Knicht.
But mair abaid unto the et come he,
As he thocht best, knokit richt quyetlie.
Than answerit scho, and at him can scho speir,
Have e not brocht the hundredth Florens heir?
But dout (said he) I have them heir present,
Than scho undid the et Incontinent.
As he come in, and enterit at the et,
Than her husband sic ane straik on him set,
Without mair talk, bot schortlie with his sword
Gave him sic wappis that he spak never word.
With the secund he did the samin gise,
And with the third he played on the same wise.
To ane secreit Chalmer their bodeis drew.
That nane should know that he any man slew.
Than said he dame gif their bodeis be found
Within this place, or it within this ground.
It sall not faill bot we thairfoir sall die
The may vile deid that can Imaginit be.
They will be mist into the Court but dout,
And will be socht in all their partis about.
Scho said good Schir, this wark first I began
To end that Ilk richt wonder weill I can.
My Joy feir not, as I said ow befoir,
For I can dres sic thing and it war moir,
This Lady had into the same Cietie,
Ane gentill man, and her brother was he:
Quhilk in the town the gyding had to keip,
Ouir all the watch, that they na way should strip
Sa on ane nicht as he past throw the streit,
At her awin et her brother culd scho meit.
Ane secreit thing (quod scho) my deir brother.
I mon ow schaw, as now to nane other.
Than enterit he and the Knicht her husband.
Welcu^mit him weill, and tuik him be the hand
Talkit at lenth and mirrelie drank the wine,
And than the Knicht said to her brother sine.
Brother (said he) richt hartlie I Inquire,
Of our counsall richt greitlie I desire
To have the same, for thairof I have neid,
Her brother said, trewlie sa God me speid,
^t my power, my counsall and good thoche,
Ze sall not want, and thairm dout e nocht.
Scho said brother this is the v^rray case,
Zi sterday last their come unto our place,
Unkind be us, ane honest nobill Kmcht.
Quhome we Intreitit the best manner we micht,
And sa be chance he fell in argument
Quhairat my husband stude nathing content.
At last he ran sa heich in vilame,
Quhat wald e mair my husband gart him die.
And still he lyis into ane Chalmer hid.
To na persoun as it is knawin nor kid.
And we have nane to do for us as now
This greit matter for to conuoy bot ow.
Gif he be found with us as chance may be,
It will not faill, but dout we will both die.
And sa scho maid bot mentioun of ane Knicht,
Not schawing him the verity nor richt,
Her brother said deliver him to me,
I sall him beir in ane sek to the se.
Scho heiring that was wonder blyith and glaid
Deliuerit him the deid Knicht as scho said.
And the hie gait to the sey he is past
With the deid Knicht, and thairm did him cast.
This being done, to his sister he said,
Ze ar now quyte of one thairfoir be glaid.
As e desirit this matter now is dressed.
Now fill the wine let us drink of the best.
That sall e have (quod scho^ with mirrie cheir,
With all our hartis the best that we have heir.
To the Chalmer in all haist past scho s^ne,
As it had been for to have brocht him wine.
And than begouth with ane loud voice to cry.
O deir brother richt wonder frayit am I
The same Ilk Knicht that e kest in the se,
In our Chalmer agane is cum to me.
Than her brother thairof had greit meruell,
^^hen that he hard his sister sa him tell.
And I traist that their can not be sic thing,
Zit not the les agane to me him bring.
I sall him put he sall not cum agane,
Bot still for ay I wait he sall remane.
He band him fast into ane other sek,
With ane greit stane hingand about his nek.
The nirt Knicht tuik, believing that it was
The first deid Knicht and to the sey can pas,
Upon his bak, the hie gait makis richt.
And their but mair castis in the secund Knicht.
Than come he hame to his sister and said,
Na mair e sall with one Knicht be afraid:
For he is cast into the sey sa far,
That weill I wait he sall never cum nar.
Thairfoir fill wine, and let us drink about,
For of one Knicht I put ow out of dout.
To her Chalmer to fetch wine scho did fane,
With ane loud voice scho cryit frayitlie agane.
O my brother the Knicht I say ow sure,
Quhome e did drown, is in my Chalmer flure
Woe be to me, I wait not quhat to say,
For be na mean he will not bide away.
The brother hard, and said quhat devil is this
That verray Knicht he is sum witch I wis.
I have him drownit two sindrie times but dout
And ay agane of the sey cu^mis out
Zit the third time deluier him to me,
And I na mair sall cast him in the se:
Bot I sall burn his banis into ane fire,
Brother (said scho) that same thing I desire.
Than scho deliuerit the last Knicht of the three,
And he beleuit it was the first trewlie,
Sa the third Knicht away with him hes (...)
Knawing nathing bot all three had been ane.
Without the ^oun ane mile fra the Cietie,
In ane Forest a greit fire biggit he,
And the third Kniche thairm he kest to burn,
Believing weill he had done ane good turn
That put away the verray Instrument
That was abill his sister to have schent.
This deid knicht brint, that other did him speid
As becu^mis all, to do his natural deid.
Up fra the fire he past ane bowschot space
Into the wod to do sic besines.
And sa it chancit that samin verray nicht,
Come throw the wod rydand ane other Knicht,
Quhilk had ane tryist the morn in the Cietie,
At ane Justing their him behude to be.
For werynes was both houngrie and called,
He blent about, and the fire culd behald.
Him to refresche hidder he raid thairto,
Bot he wist not quhat had been their ado.
He lichtit down, knit his horse to ane tree,
And to the fire Incontment past he,
To warm his hands, and to comfort his cors,
And for ane quhile to rest his tyrit horse.
Than the same knicht that was y^ woman's brother
Come to the fire agane and saw ane other
Stand at the fire, quhome to he said in hy,
Quhat may thou be, he said ane Knicht am I.
Quod he agane I wait thou art na Knicht,
Thou art ane devil, that weill I wait full richt
Twice I the drownit, the first time in ane sck,
The secund time ane greit stane at thy nek.
And now thridlie, I brint the in this fire,
And it to leif me think thou will not tire.
War thou the devil, and als the deuillis dam
Or I war cu^merit with the sa as I am,
I rather bu^ne the ten times in ane fire,
Thy horse thy self, both bowk banis and lire.
As he sa said, in his arms he him tuik,
In middis the fire he kest him in the smuik.
And sine his horse abone him also kest,
Sa brint them both or ever he tuik rest.
To his sister than come he hame agane,
Quhat him berid he tald to her in plane.
Fill the best wine (quod he) and spair it nocht
For without dout richt deir I have it bocht.
After in the fire that I had brint him anis,
Incontinent he standis up bowk and banis,
Befoir the fire, and his horse him beside,
Quhat devil (said I) me think thou schaipis to ride
Sa in the fire I kest him horse and all,
All this sister said he chancit me befall.
Than in her mind scho knew Incontinent,
That he had brint ane Knicht of tornament.
Zit not the les scho brocht him the best wine,
Drank mirrelie, and sa past his way sine.
Not lang after this wife and her awin Knicht
Fell in debait, bechance upon ane nicht,
And scho him gave sum wordis outrageous,
Hie and haltand, and verray dispittous.
Quhairthrow he grew at her in matalent,
Two stripis or three, till her sa hes he lent.
Than said this wife theif will thou (...)rther me
As thou hes done the Empreouris (...)hts three
Thou seruis weill to be hangit and drawin,
Gifsi^ thing war unto our ^ichtbouris knawin
Nichtbouris about their cruel wordis did hei^
The rumor raise, the fokis grew all in feir.
Word weut fra hand unto the Empreour.
They war send for but any delatour.
Quha was accusit for sic ane cruel crime,
S^^e scho confessed the deid, the hour and time.
How he murdreist the Empreour Knichts three
Within the nicht, into greit cruelty
And how that they spuileit fra every Knicht,
Five scoir Florens of gold that was sa bricht.
And how that scho the matter first Inuentit,
And how that he thairto first disassentit.
Sa they war both condampnit be the Law,
That officers at horse taillis should them draw:
To the Gallous out throw the haill Cietie,
To their greit schame, that Ilk man mi^ht it se.
On the Gallous they war both put to deid,
As they deseruit but mercy or remeid.
The Master said unto the Empreour
Seruit they not died, yt maid sa greit murthou^
The Empreour said that wife was wonder evil
Be apperance was temptit with the devil.
S^ho was the first the matter mufit and bred,
S^chke the first the samin gart out spread.
The Master said war sall cum to our sell,
Slae our sone for our Ill wifes counsel.
My sone (said he) for that now e have said,
Their sall na charge of deid be to him laid
As for this day, thairfoir pas to our place,
The Master said God save our nobill grace.
Sa^uik his leif, and with a^^ (...) heart,
To his awin house, fra the Court did depart.
Quhen the Empress of their tythance hard tell
Scho was may like for to have slane her sell.
As ane wod wife come to the Empreour,
Behald (said scho) ane woman of dolor.
Except that e get me souer remeid.
I sall but dout my awin self put to deid.
I am sa schamit with the country about,
That I think schame of my Chalmer cum out
And na remeid quhat ever I do or say,
Bot with falls Taillis put of fra day to day,
Fie upon ow that sufferis sic ane thing,
Ze are not worth to be Empreour or King.
Ze cure na schame, e cure na warldis wonder
To have me schamit, and our self put to under
And to be schamit and callit ane Empreours wife
I sall rather my self fall on my knife.
The pane of deid Induris bot half ane hour,
Bot ever mair schame sall degraid honor.
The Empreour said I pray God ow defend,
That e tak not sic ane unhappy end.
To tak in thocht our awin self for to sla,
Quhat ever e do, I pray ow do not sa.
And I pray God that I not causer be
Of sic mischance, nor sir adversity.
Bot will e thoill and suffer ane schort quhile,
Zour cause will cum to aue far better style,
And our complaint will have the better end
Zour Just querrell ever I sall defend.
Quod scho agane, the end sall not be good,
Both ow and me it sall us both exclude
Of this I ^pire, and put us to confusioun,
Zon^ seum Masters leidis ow in si^ abusioun,
That it sall chance to ow heir esterwart,
As it come to ane King and his Stewart.
The Empreour said, I pray ow now but faill,
Of our gudnes to tell me forth that taill.
Scho said my Lord to tell ane taill agane,
Weill I persaue it will be bot in vane:
For the nixt day the seuint Master will cum,
And tell ane taill to saif our sone that's dum.
And help him as his fellowis did befoir,
F^a they have done, e will heir me no moir.
On the aucht day than sall our awin sone cum
And tell his taill quhilk this lang time was du^
To quhais talking e sall give sic plesour,
That I salbe put forth of our memour.
And the greit lufe betuix us two hes been,
In time cu^ming now salbe foret clean.
The Empreour said sic ane thing can not be,
Without e serve the same vnwittand me.
Quhilk I believe was never in our thocht,
Thairfoir as it sic thing trow will I nocht.
The Empress said, than I sall tell my taill,
Quhilk to our grace it sall greitlie auaill.
And cause ow fra greit perrellis eschew
Quhilk I persaue is ellis prepairit for ow.
Be our cursed sone, and his seum Masters all
Quhilk after this richt weill persaue e sall.
The Empreour said, now I pray our gudnes,
Tell forth that taill and leif our besines.
S^ scho began her taill with feneit cheir,
Not blyith at heart, as e sall after heir.
Bot or scho tell her taill forth to the King,
Of the last taill now let us say sum thing.
MORALITAS.
OMERCIE God quhat thing is this,
The matter greitly meruellis me,
That cunning Clerkis can not discus
The Ill and the Iniquity
That in women been,
Bred with greit tray and tene
The greit dissait and subteltie
Sic kenenes with greit cruelty
was ueuer hard nor seen,
This Lady in her windo set,
Singing her noitis sa curtous
Presenting their the deuillis net
Under color sa cautelous,
Zoung men at till her gane,
And in her net ar taken
And their with mind malicious
Ju heart being sa covetous
Causit murdreis them Ilk ane,
This murt her first scho did Invent
That causit their men for to be slane
Syne was the verray Instrument
First for to make it knawin agane
Sa money wayis scho fand,
For to tyist her husband
To do mischief with sic falls trane,
And syue the same scho culd not lane
Bot maid it kend fra hand.
Throw her malice and bet Inuy
Both of her husband and her sell
The cruel m^rther scho did out cry
Qubair of nichtbouris had greit meruell,
Quhilk thing they never knew,
Quhill that the wife it schew
And causit her the treuth to tell,
Now all the matter first befell
And how the Anchtis they slew.
Quha was puneist for their misdeid,
And gat the rigor of the Law,
Now Schirs perfane quhat dois proceid
Of ane Ill woman's wickit saw,
Duredome was first in plane
Syne gredynes but lane
To wow the woman as e know.
The gold and slauchter did on draw
And causit the men be slane.
Thairfoir I say they that hes wyfes,
Let them not all their secreitis know,
For gif it chance that they two stryfes.
All that scho knawis that will scho schaw.
And rather mair nor les
They have that use expres,
For gif e len them anis ane blaw
Quyte auld freindschip they let faw
Turnis all to wickitnes.
As did this wife in greit malice,
Her husband and her self put down,
Throw her counsall and couetice
To hyde the same had na ressoun.
That thing e wald have hid,
That to our wife forbid
And it war never sa greit tressoun.
That scho sall tell throw all the town
As this wickit wife did.
The wife man sayis their toungis ar schairy
As any sword is wrocht with hand,
Quhairwith sa crouslie they will cairp
Ilk word they say alone sall stand.
They ar sa outrageous,
I^efull and dispittous,
They cure not the wag of ane wand
To gar ow tyne ba^th life and land
Quhen they grow furious.
God save my sell fra sic ane sort
For I persaue they ar perrellous
I promeis ow it is na sport
To find our vnfreind in our house.
Quhioder be he or scho,
To tell all that I do
And they be ^auld and busteous,
S^ tu^mersum and malicious,
I can not tell quhairto.
(...) Ne intenderis maliciae mulieris quia nouissima illius amara quasi
ab^intheum long fac ab ea viam tuam quia lingua eius accuta vt gladius bioeps.
Et pedes eius discendunt in mortem. Proverb. 5.
Ane praise to the Sext Doctor.
THY goldin tongue with grace sa thou hes gydit,
That to this Child it life thou hes prouydit
Contrair the Queen, a vengeance on her cors
Bot without dout or sentence be decydit,
I wait the Child he will bauldlie abide it.
For quhy he knawis both the best and the worse
And gif fa be the Queen mon bide on force.
Zit not the les thou should have thankis but dout
Thou good Master that keipit thy day about.
The Empress seuint Taill
BEfoir this time their was ane Nobill King,
That lufit his wife abone all eirdlie thing.
He had to her sic greit lufe and favor,
He keipit her Ilk day within closour.
In the greit house of ane strenthie Castle,
Quhairof the keyis he keipit ay him sell,
Quhairat this Lady tuik greit heuines,
That scho was sa haldin in sic straitues.
Wantit solace and all good company,
Bot quhen the King come in allanerlie.
In other partis their was ane Nobill Knicht.
It chancit him to dream into the nicht
Into his sleip he thocht weill that he saw,
The fairest Queen that ever man did know.
Quhais lufe he covet abone all cirdlie thing,
Gif he micht se her on the cird walking.
Nathing douting, bot be her cum should he
To greit honor, worschip and honesty.
That samin nicht this Queen in her visio^^
Dreamit on this Knicht, and on the same fasso^
And it nouther of other knew the name,
Nor knawledge had be fassoun or be fame.
This Knicht he raise upon the morn airlie,
Rememberit weill on his dream sickerlie.
And determit into his mind and thocht,
Nor be na way to tak rest wald he nocht:
Unto the time that Lady quhill he fand,
Gif that scho micht be gottin in any land.
Lap on his horse, and in haist forth he raid,
To seik this Queen, na langer tarry maid.
Throw Royal Realms, and diverse greit countries
Throw rich Regiounis, and semelie seir cieteis
This fair Lady eid sa far in his tho^ht,
Their was na landis for her he left vnsocht.
Quhill at the last he come to ane Cietie,
Quhair he gat wit their was ane fair Lady.
Keipit sa clois, that nane micht cum her till,
Ercept alone it war the Kingis will.
Their he soiornd for his Pastime ane space,
Him to refresche in mirth and mirrines.
Sa it fortunit to him upon ane day,
Pas by the place quhair that this Lady lap.
In her windo luiking forth her alone,
For other game nor pastime gat scho none.
Sa scho chancit sone for to get ane sicht,
Qu^o^e of scho dremit of this same verray Knicht
Thinking richt weill the samin man was he,
Intill her dream befoir that scho did se.
He not knawing that that Lady was their.
Bot as chance come down by making repair.
In mean seasoun he liftit up his Ee
In her windo this Lady can he se.
Thinking richt weill it was the samin Queen,
That he befoir into his dream had seen.
Than he began to sing ane sang of lufe,
Quhilk qu^en scho hard, greitlie it did her mufe
Into his lufe, and prentit in her heart,
Quhilk was unkind to him in any part.
Zit not the les daily he maid repair,
About that place to tak pastime and air.
Than this Lady persauing this at all,
Ane bill of lufe to him scho leit down fall.
And he belyue red ouir this pretty bill,
Persauing weill the Ladeis mind and will.
Fra this time forth he vsit daily Justing,
Breking of speiris, and alswa horse rinning.
Easting of stane, and als the leidin mell,
Worsling, lowping, he did exerce him sell,
Daily actis he vsit and honest deidis,
That in the Court his fame and word up spreidis
Quhill at the last his name and good beiring,
His honest actis war schawin to the King
The King heiring his vaileant tornament,
He send for him Message Incontinent.
Quha chargeit him the King he should cum till,
To heir his mind, his pleasure and his will.
Quha come to him with all humility,
As him effeirit, law kneilling on his knie.
Schir knicht he said, I have hard of ow tell,
How in good actis e have exercit our sell,
Into my Court amang my gentill men,
Thairfoir sen I sic actis dois of ow ken,
Pleis e remane into our company,
Ze sall have giftis and good rewaird of me.
And be ane of my gaird and my counsel,
Sa it pleis ow with us remane and dwell.
Than said this Knicht and pleis our Majesty.
To have service of sic ane man as me:
I sall ow serve both with my hand and heart,
In all effairis, sic as pertenis my part.
Without rewaird or any recompense,
Sa that I may have daily our presence.
And sen our grace hes now desicit me,
Into our gaird, and on our counsall be:
I wald our grace to my desire wald grant,
Sa on service the better I micht hant.
Ane new ludgeing to have at the Tower side,
Quhair I micht be, and at our bidding bide
Gif that our grace neidit upon me call.
Ze micht gar cry out ouir the Castle wall.
Than said the King faith I consent thairto,
Ga big our house as e think best to do.
Than past the Knicht or ever he wald tire,
And feit wark men, and promeist them good hire
His house biggit with tymmer stane and thak,
With ane Masoun he maid ane derne contrak.
Out fra this house to make ane small passage,
Into y^ Tower quhair this Queen was in Cage
Quhen this was done, after his awin Intent
This same Masoun he killit Incontinent,
That he should not discover his secre,
For his rewaird this warkman this gat h^.
Than went this knicht quhe^ he plesit to y^ queen
In secreit sort, and with na man was seen.
Did her service as culd him weill effeir,
Than they talkit of diverse matters seir.
Amang the rest he spak to her of lufe,
Quhilk in ane part her heart greitlie did mufe.
Howbeit as than scho was not weill contentit,
Zit efterwart to his will scho consentit.
Sa in her thocht the Queen kest on ane day,
Of this matter quhat scho should do or say:
Tuitching this Knicht, als to her awin husband
Be sic thing knawin, than ba^^sching the land
To my tinsell, and ever warldis schame.
For upon me wald be laid all the blame.
Because that I wald not the Knicht discure,
I salbe callit the Ill woman full sure.
Also the Knicht he sall eschaip na way,
Bot of the deith the schairp he sall assay.
Thairfoir is best, and I persaue my sell,
To hald my tongue, and not ane word to tell.
And sa all times quhen they pleisit to meit,
Be this derne way they eid to their secreit.
Sine efterward the Queen gave him ane Ring
Quhilk at wedlok scho ressauit fra the King.
Greit Tornamentis this Knicht he vsit daily
And ever bure away the victory.
Quhairthrow he stude both in Court and with King
In greit favor, for his manly having.
Into sa far, that he was efterwart
Maid be the King Comptroller and Stewart.
And all his Realm he had in Regiment,
T^^k in his maillis, Gersowmes and daily rent.
Upon a day it did appleis the King,
For his pleasure to pas to the hunting.
To his Stewart the King gave than command
To be reddy, and pas with him fra hand.
Upon the morn than all the Court vprais,
And with the king all to the Hunting gais.
All the lang day they chais in the Forest
Quhill the king thocht he wald have had su^ rest
For he was tyrit, and werie all begane,
Sa he reposit beside ane fair Fontane.
Than his Stewart quhair he sat with the king
After travel he fell upon sleiping.
And sa the king persauit at the last,
The Quenis Ring upon his finger fast.
Quhilk the knicht knew be countenance of the king
That he had seen and markit that Ilk ring.
Than to the king with feneit countenance
He said my Lord this is the verray chance.
Ane Malady hes taken me in this tide.
I am sa seik na mair hunting may bide.
Without I get the sooner sum remeid,
I dout richt sair that it salbe my deid.
Praying our grace that e wald give me leif
For to pas hame, our grace not for to grief.
Quod he good friend gif e pleis to pas hame
I grant ow leif, pas on in Goddis Name.
Incontineut he gat upon his horse,
Feneing him self to have ane seiklie cors.
Hame to his house into all haist he raid,
And to the Queen he past withouttin baid.
Without process deliuerit her the king.
That scho befoir had gottin fra the king.
And tald her how the king the same did know
On his finger, on sleip quhen he him saw.
Beseiking her gif that the kingis grace
Speirit for the ring within schort time or space
Scho should him schaw the same but questioun
For to exclude Ill word and suspitioun,
This being done, he past his preuie way,
And to his bed he maid him but delay.
The hunting done, the King come hame at ene.
Incontinent he said unto the Queen,
Quhair is the Ring in wedlok I ow gave.
Schaw me the same for I it now mon have.
Scho said Lord, sa sone to quhat Intent
Wald e it se na way it is absent.
Than said the King schaw me it Incontinent:
Or I sweir ow e sall it sair repent.
Than up scho raise, and to her Coffer went,
And brocht the Ring to him Incontinent.
Quhen he it saw, he was richt wonder glaid,
And half aschamit unto the Queen he said:
Madame forsooth, sen first hour I was borne,
Sa like ane Ring be warkmen maid or schorne.
To the Knichtis Ring, to ouris I never saw,
I wald have sworn war not y^ now I know
Both had been ane that gart me ask our Ring
Quod scho my Lord believe e sic ane thing?
Nay, nay, Madame, I cry ow now mercy,
For weill I wait sic thing their can not be.
Scho said my Lord, tak not sic thing in thocht
For the same man perchance y^ our ring wrocht
He maid the Knichtis, and on the samin sort,
Quod he Madame I said it bot in sport.
Quod scho my Lord God mot ow grant pardoun
Gif e me hald in any suspitioun.
God ow forgive our Ill suspicious mind,
Gif e suspect in any sort or kind.
Considdering of our Castle the strenth,
And my lawtie e have kend at the lenth.
And sine our self had the keyis in keiping,
I mexuell how e can suspect sic thing.
Quod he Madame I pray ow tak patience,
I said nathing for to do ow offense.
Bot as e know desirit my ^ing to se,
Quhilk now agane e sall ressaue of me.
With als good will as ever I it gave,
Scho said my Lord the same I will ressaue,
Sa efterwart e suspect me na way,
He said Madame, that sall I not perfay.
After this time the Knicht causit prepair
In his awin house ane Banquet or dennair.
Sine to the King he said and pleis our grace,
This is the treuth, the verray cause and case.
My bedfellow is cum fra her country,
Quhilk thocht greit lang my presence for to se,
To her I causit ane dennar to prepair,
With all my heart I wald our grace war their
And pleis our grace to do me sic honor,
Surely (said he) I will do ow plesour.
In that behalf, and it war mekill moir,
The Knicht he kneillit, and thankit him thairfoi^
Than in his heart he was richt wonder glaid
For the kind wordis the King had to him said
Than past he to the Queen Incontinent,
Be his derne Caif, the straicht way is he went,
And said Madame, pleis ow to tak sic paue,
Into my house to dine with our Souerane
This samm day, and cleith ow up richly.
As is the gise and use of my country.
And sit their at in Tabill with the King.
Euin as e war my wife spousit with ane King
And make him all the past^^e and good cheir.
As to his grace in best sort can effeir.
Scho said Schir Knicht as e pleis sa I will.
As I best can our plesour to fulfill.
The hour become, and dennar time of day,
To the Knichts house the King come on away.
In the mean time the Queen come her dern gait
In the Knichts hall beliue scho gat her sait.
In sic clething as the Knicht gave command,
After the gise and fassoun of his land.
And quhen the King come to the Knichtis haw.
Sa sone as he the Ladeis visage saw,
He thocht scho was woman may like his queen,
Sen he was borne, that ever he saw with Eve.
^it not the les Ilk ane on their maneir,
They hailsit other as it culd best effeir.
Than to the Knicht the King said quietly,
Quhat is scho this sa semelie for to se?
The Knicht he said, and pleis our Majesty.
This is forsooth my lufe and my Lady,
Quhilk of lang time fra me hes been abseut,
Bot now I am of her cu^ming content,
Sa that e be content that scho is heir,
I am said he^ sa God grant me good cheir.
And first they wesche, and sine to Tabill went,
And ever mair the King in his Intent,
Thocht yt he knew the Queen and had knawledge
Be her fassoun, her form and her visage,
And to him self he said in all his life,
He never saw ane woman mair like his wife.
^it not the les the strenth of his awin Tower
Dissauit his mind, and led him in error.
That in sa far he gave far mair credence
To the Knichtis wordis, and cullourit eloquence
Nor to the thing he saw with his awin Ene,
Quhilk blindit him, and als misknew his Queen
Than scho began to talk of sum glaidnes,
And steir the King up in sum mirrines.
Sa sone as he hard her speiche and her voice,
Quhidder to speik or for to hald him clois.
He not weill wist bot it said to him sell,
O Lord in heuin heir is ane greit meruell.
This woman is in fassoun and favor
In speiche, in voice, makdome and portratour,
In behauingis, and als in conditiounis,
In fax, in face, in fait and in fassounis.
And in all sort sa done like my awin Queen,
In all this world was never ane liker seen.
And it the strenth of the Tower him begylit,
With the Knichtis wordis yt him sa sielie sylit
Sa at the meit with mirrines amang,
The Knicht desirit the Queen to sing ane sang.
Than scho began to sing ane sang of lufe,
The King heiring, greitlie his heart can mufe.
Said to him self, and this be not my wife,
I wait scho is not leuand upon life.
And than agane he thocht that can not be,
For I my self in keiping hes the kie:
Of the greit Tower quhair nathing can cum in
Bot I my self that keipis both key and gin,
Than na man can enter within that Tower,
Except my self, nouther be time nor hour.
Sa all denner he sat in sic consait,
With his awin self into sic strange debait.
And sa he sat, and wist not quhat to say,
And at the last he bad sone tak away,
The Tabill and claith, he wald na langer bide
And said he wald about the feildis ride.
Than said the Knicht and pleis our Nobill grace
For to remane ane pretty time and space.
We sall ow make mair mirrines and cheir,
For without dout our grace is welcum heir.
Than said the Queen, and pleis our Majesty,
For to remane with us in company.
We sall ow make the mirrines and sport,
All that we can to hald ow in comfort.
Si(...)ke as dois the Queen in her solace,
With all service that we can do our grace.
For all requeist, planelie the King said nay,
For to remane, gart tak the Tabill away.
And said he was in that same verray tide
In sic fantise, he micht na langer bide.
And sa the claith and Tabill away was taken,
^p raise the King and to the flure is gane.
Thankit the Knicht of his kindness and cheir,
The Lady als into her best maneir.
Sine in all haist to the Castle he went,
To se the Queen, gif scho was their present.
And than the Queen went on her preuie way,
Rest of her clais and her uncouth array.
And quhen the King enterit within the Tower
He fand the Queen sitting intill her Bower.
In the same clais, and sort as he her left,
Quhairthrow he was in his speiche half bereft
Quhen he her saw he braist her twice or thrice,
And said Madame I am in ane fantise.
This day I dynit with the Knicht as e know
And with his lufe, the quhilk I never saw,
Sa like to ow be form and fassoun
Be speiche and voice, and als conditioun.
All dennar time I was sa steirit in thocht,
That I not wist gif it was e or nocht.
And ay my mind it was in sic despair,
I wist not weill gif e war heir or their.
Than said the Queen I meruell of our mind,
That to sic thing our heart should be Inclinde.
For e know weil the greit strenth of our tower
As to the keyis they ar at our plesour.
And my body e know hes na credence,
To cum or gang without our awin license.
And as e know to fle I have na wingis,
How can e than Imagine siclike thingis?
Quhat kind of way is possibill to me,
For to be in one Knichtis company?
Gif ever e red the buik of Phisnomy
Thairin e may richt weill reid and espy
That it may stand ane to be like ane other
Howbeit that ane be not syb to the other.
Thairfoir my Lord I ow require on richt
Have na suspect betuix me and one Knicht,
Than said the King forsooth that sall not be,
I grant my self into this fault gyltie.
Into sa far as I misdemit ow,
Their is na cause sic thing to think I trow.
Than said the Queen sen gyltie e ow grant,
I ow forgive, sa sic thing e not hant.
Upon the morn the Knicht said to the King
And pleis our grace e will me grant a thing.
This lang ago I have ow done service,
The best I culd, pertening my office.
Ze se my lufe is cum from her country,
And to return hamewart for to cause me.
And I Intend (gif it be our plesour
Unto my lufe e wald do sic honor,
To mary her in face of halie Kirk,
As God commandis all Christin man to wirk)
To be at hame callit my lauchfull wife,
Quhill dowesum deid depart us fra this life.
Beseiking now our Nobill grace heirfoir,
For my rewaird, as now I ask no moir:
Bot with our hand deliver her to me,
Befoir the Priest that the pepill may se.
It will be callit to me ane greit honor.
Sa that it be our graces awm plesour.
Quhair that my wife was geuin me be a King,
In our country will be callit ane greit thing
In sic effairis, as is the auld fassoun,
Unto wedlok quhen twasum makis the^ boun
Than said the King our rewaird is to small,
That e desire or charges me with all.
I will do that richt glaidlie for our saik,
And for her lufe that now should be our maik.
The Knicht thankit the King a thousand spse,
That answerit him sa kindly on sic wise.
The marriage and day of the banquet,
The King him self he gart devise and set.
On the quhilk day, the King with greit honor
Come to the Kirk to do the Knicht plesour*
The parische Priest with his Kirklike bestme^ts
Was weill Indewit with all abilements,
For to solemn the band of marriage,
Into the Kirk, as than was the usage*
In this mean tune the Knicht gart make reddy
In his awin house his lufe and his Lady,
Weill all cled up after the conswetude
Of his country quhilk he thocht was may good
And gart two knichtis to the Kirk her connop
With greit blyithnes, solempnitie and Joy.
Quha than beleuit his Paramouris had been.
Howbeit scho was in deid their native Queen.
Than said the Priest the quhilk was his dewtie
Quha delyueris this woman now to me?
That I agane may gif her to this Knicht,
In face of Kirk, and in the pepillis sicht.
Than said the king that sall I do bedene,
Because scho is sa wonder like my Queen.
I lufe her all the better be my life,
Her face and favor is sa done like my wife.
As is the use in filling of sic vandis
The King he tuik his awin wife be the handis,
And to the Priest he gave this Lady bricht,
The Priest agane gave her unto the Knicht.
Of halie Kirk, after the auld fassoun,
Than he began to reid his Orisoun,
Upon his buik full besilie can say*
The band co^pleit he maid between them tway
This being done the Knicht said to the King
Schir e have done to me ane kindly thing.
With our awin hand that hes deliuerit me
This Nobill woman befoir this company.
My Schip quhairin we purpois to pas hame,
Is alreddy now fleting on the fame.
And we wald fane with our graces license
We war furderit hamewart for to pas hence.
My Marmaris they ar in reddynes,
To tak up saillis, and to the sey them dres.
Thairfoir I wald our Nobill Majesty
Sen e have schawin sa greir kindness to me,
Unto my Schip e wald my wife conuoy,
For scho thairof wald have greit mirth and Joy
Considdering scho is now to depart,
It wald her do greit comfort in her heart.
And als I wald e gave her good counsall
All man ^euand for to forsaik all haill
Bot me alone, quhilk is her awin true Knicht,
And maryit her into our graces sicht.
Than said the King all sic is richt godly,
The maryit wife obedient to be:
To hit husband, and all vthers refuse*
I have na dout bot all sic scho will use.
Than went the King with all his company,
And to the Schip conuoyit that fair Lady.
And be the gait his counsall he her schew,
That scho should be to her Knicht traist and true.
Him to obey, and hald him in honor,
Lufe him alone a^^^e all creature.
And nane leuand in her mind for to have,
Quhais counsall than I traist scho did ressaue.
Than the Queen said and pleis our Majesty
This good counsall that e have geuin to me
It salbe done, and it war ten times moir,
Quod he Madame, now I thank ow thairfoir
Praying to God our schip weill to conuoy,
Swa to our land that e may cum with Joy.
And than he tuik the Queen first be the hand
And sine the Knicht, quhilk tha^ was her husband
And gave the^ both his blissing quhair he stude
quhilk to y^ queen as scho thocht was richt good
For at that time scho thocht it was her part,
Howbeit this King was blindit to the heart.
Sieve first the Queen, and than this nobill Knicht
At this blind King ather they tuik good nicht
The King her kissed and bad fair weill adieu,
Sa like my wife (quod he) I never knew.
And her favor will cause me think on ow
Quhen e ar past, this trewlie e may trow.
Than said the Queen law kneilland on her kne
I thank our grace that sic thocht takis on me.
Do I not sa quhen that we are cum hame.
And think on ow, richt far I am to blame.
For greit kindness and Inwarr courtasie
That e haif schawin to our awin knicht and me
This being done to schip they make passage
Enterit in burde and maid for their veyage.
Raisit up Ankeris and Cabillis in they drew,
The wind was fair, eum as they wald it blew
Heisit up saillis and to seward they past,
The Skipper speillit belyue to the top Mast.
To spy the wedder, gif tempest did appeir,
Into that case their saillis the lawer beir.
Within schort space the schip was out of sicht,
Sa was the king both quite of queen and knicht
And than belyue the king hamewart (...) went,
To his Castle and fand the Queen absent.
Gif he was noyit or crabit at his heart,
I trow be few of sturt can tell his part.
His face it swat, his feit and handis schuik,
Upon na man with patience he micht luik.
He socht the tower and spyit all round about,
Gif he culd find the gait quhair scho gat out.
He fand the hoill and secreit way at last,
Quhair yt knicht come and quhair away scho past
Than cryit he out full wallaway allace,
Heir is becum ane greit mischeuous case.
The knicht quhome to I gave sic confidence
Of lufe and favor, be counsall and credence.
On him alone I wald have lippinnit my life,
Now tratourlie hes cane away my wife.
I was ane fule fulfillit of fantasy,
That gave mair faith unto his wordis sly:
Nor I did ay to my awm seeing Ene,
Quhairthrow I want my bedfeliow and queen
And schamit for ay with sak and derisioun,
Quhilk will mebring to utter confusioun.
Considdering weill I had my Ene to se,
All man may weill exampill tak be me.
The Empress than said to the Empreour
This taill I tald my Lord for our plesour.
Wald God the same that e weill understood,
Than should e be of all danger denude.
The Empreour said Madame sa have I seill,
All that e said I understood richt weill.
Quod scho my Lord remember how this Prence
Unto this knicht gave sic perfect credence.
Als to his wordis greiter credence he gave,
Nor his awin Ene, sa he did him dissaue.
In like manner unto their Masters seum,
Ze give mair faith nor to greit God in heuin
Be apperance, for daily e may se
Quhat displesure they seuin wald wirk on me.
Me to destroy they labor nicht and day,
And e give faith to Ilk word that they say.
Mair nor e do to our awin natural Ene,
Quhilk heirefter will both be hard and seen.
Have e not seen how our sone raif my face,
And it e give skarse credence in that case.
Quhilk it beiris still the markis as e may se,
Quhairof as it I get na remedy.
And als e know how me he wald have scha(...)
Defoulit our bed quhairthrow I was defauilt
All this become throw his Maisteris defense
Quhome to e give sa confirmit credence.
This e mark not, nor preutis into our heart,
Bot it noyis me Inwart in every part.
Thairfoir richt sair I dout the samin thing
Sall happin ow, as it did to this king.
That gave credence quhill he was quite begylit
Sa is our self with their same seuin ouirsylit.
He said I give to my Eme mair credence,
Nor to they seuin for all their greit Science.
Thairfoir the morn for all their taillis and sawis
My sone he sall the Judgment thoill of lawis
And on the morn his officers he gart call,
Commandit them that they should furthwith all
Tak out his Sone, and on the Gallous hing.
That it war done befoir all other thing.
Than sic ane noyis raise up in the Cietie,
It for to heir it was ane greit piety:
That the Empreour his awin sone should gar sla,
Within that town money heart it maid wa.
The seuint Master hard cell of this tythadd,
To the Sergands he haistit him fra hand.
Them for to meit in all good haist him sped,
Ouhair they yt child down throw the Cietie led
Quod he good friends, hartlie I ow beseik,
Tarry ane time quhill I the Empreour speik.
I traist to God or I cum far away.
I sall his life fra perrell save this day.
The Officers they war richt wonder glaid,
And did euin sa, as the Master them bad.
To the Empreour he haistit throw the town,
And on his kneis befoir him sat he down:
Randering him sic reverence as accordis,
Sine after him to his Princes and Lordis,
The Empreour with greit Indignatioun,
Dengeabill vult and with browis casting down
Saying to him all sorrow mot the fall,
Both unto the, and to thy fellowis all.
Ane dum oung child to me e seuin hes sent.
Quhilk spak richt weill quhe^ he unto ow went
Because e seuin hes send me sic ane hidder,
He and e all salbe hangit togidder.
The Master said, and pleis our nobill grace
Fra now to morn it is bot ane schort space:
And than be none with grace of God in heuin,
Zour sone sall speik, and we his Maisteris seuin
Unto our grace we promittis faithfully,
On pane of deith, first we all seuin sine he.
The Empreour said, gif I micht that believe,
Na langer than desirit I for to leave,
The Master said, I pray ow bide sa lang,
And gif we faill, all aucht e sall us hang.
Than oppinlie e sall ken all the strife
And discentioun, betuix us and our wife.
And gif our grace will not do as I say,
Ze will repent richt sair ane other day.
And sall happin perchance to ow sum nicht,
As it bechancit to ane richt courts Knicht:
That deit schortlie, as I in story reid,
For ane small blude that he saw his wife bleid.
To quhome after scho was richt vncourtes,
And richt unkind, for all his greit kindness.
The Empreour said Master I ow requeir
Tell me that taill, richt fane I wald it heir.
The Master said gar call our sone agane
The haill story I sall tell ow in plane.
In time cu^ming Enduring all our life
Ze sall eschew the schrewitues of ane wife.
The Empreour said I will call him agane,
Conditionally under the samin pane.
The morn or none speik he not oppinlie,
First he, sine e, togidder all sall die,
The Master said of that I am content,
The Empreour said and thairto I consent,
Than causit he to call the Child agane,
And the Master called forth his taill in plane.
Bot the Queen's last taill it farther or we ga
We will persaue, or we tell any ma.
MORALITAS.
INTO this taill richt small I can persaue
To be extract of Moral good sentence,
Bot that this Knicht subtellie did dissaue
This Nobill King that gave him sic credence
In sindrie sortis schew him benevolence,
Syne he agane upon the other side,
With greit falset did all his way is provide.
As to our Queen, quhair scho Inferris this taill
To her purpois, and to her awin effairis.
As thinkis me, the matter ryndes haill
To her awin schame, as the taill self declairis.
For to tell forth planelie scho not spairis
And to reheirs the huredome that was hid
Betuix the knicht and the Queen that they did.
Considdering that they ar Queen's both
Quha can her quyte sic ane matter on bring
Gif ane hes schame it is the vtheris skaith,
For to be falls to her husband and King,
T cow e bot our Empress can do sic thing
In deid I trow or all our buik be endit
Ze sall persaue als fac scho hes offendit.
Gif ane Doctor into his sermon tell,
And reprufe vice, greit faultis or greit error
In the same vice he is gyltie him sell
How sall he s(...)b that vice with his honor?
He smottis himself as he dois his Nichtbour
Alwayis upon his awin blanket he spi^tis,
And his awin taill hard on the heillis him hittis.
Of my Nichtbour gif I ane Ill taill tell
Of blasphemy, dishonor, or it schame,
It may perchance siclyke cum to my sell
Perhappin war bringing on als greit blame.
How can I than in any sort defame
Myawin Nichtbour, except my self be clean
Sic thing should be considderit and weill seen.
Our awin Empress quhome of that we now speik
Scho put reproach unto ane other Queen,
Bot scho may cast her Cartis in at the Cleik
Of the same sort, thocht now sic be not seen
As Matthew sayis, cum sa as now I mean.
Fra thy awin Ey first thou draw out the balk
To thy Nichtbour than peirtly thou may talk.
Thairfoir I say thou had neid for ^ose
Or thou ane fault unto thy Nichtbour fand,
Of siclyke faultis se thou weill purgeit be
Him to reprufe or that thou tak on hand
Ellis thy reprufe with honor can not stand,
It to obey their is few will be abill
Gif thou be kend in that same culpabill.
How can our Queen sa foull ane fault Infer
Contrair ane Queen, and scho her self gyltie
In the same crime, ea, and perchance far war
Howbeit it be cloikit mair quyetlie,
Fie on falset, fie on hid harlatrie,
That ane Ill taill of thy nichtbour can tell,
And that same taill redoundis enin to thy sell.
Ane reproach to the Empress.
THOU glaikit gallarrand queen, now with thy glorious glois
With thy falls taillis of tene, thou trowis to win the hois.
Nay, nay, not sa my lois, thairs it sum graith to find
Ane prick into our nois, or we have done behind,
Trow e to blaw us blind, thairs other taillis to tell
Quhen stabilit is all this wind, luik than quha beiris the bell:
The wraik sall on thy sell, both the sorrow and syte,
Thou proserpine of hell, we cure the not ane myte
For all thy greit dispyte, bid ouir with harlatrie
Full weill we sall the quyte, that all the world may se.
Thou bysemeir balamie, thy hippis fall thoill her haisteris,
For thou seruis them trewlie, at the Child and his Maisteris.
The Taill of the Seuint Master is how the man deit because he saw his Wyfes
finger bleid.
UPON a time their was ane Nobill Knicht,
That had ane wife y^ was both fair and bricht
Quhome he sa lufit, that be na way he micht
Of the haill day ane hour want her of sicht.
Upon a time after meit and glaidnes,
For their pastime their two went to the Ches,
And in his hand it happinnit happinnit to haif
His awin byknife, and sa amang the laif
Thairon scho straik her hand a litill we
Amaist ane drop of blude that e micht se.
Sa sone as he the blude saw of his wife,
Alwayis he said, that scho wald lois her life.
Befoir them all, amang them fell he down,
For verray woe into ane deidlie swoun.
Incontinent than scho began to cast
Upon his face cauld water wonder fast.
Than he ouircome within ane litill space,
The called watter they wap sa in his face.
The Minister he gart call of the town,
And prayit him to heir his Consessioun.
For weill he knew without any remeid,
Their was nathing at him bot only deid.
For na seiknes, nor for nane other deid
Bot only saw his wifes finger bleid.
The Minister exhortit him anon,
And sone after to deith this Knicht is gone.
For quhome their was greit sturt and beuailling,
Amang the rest his wife maid may murning.
The Burial with greit solempnitie,
Was maid and done in best manner micht be.
Than this Lady scho maid ane solemn vow,
To leif ay still as dois the Trytill Dow.
All her life time to leif in Chastity.
And never to know any mannis company:
Bot ayly still above her husbandis grave,
And never mair warldlie comfort to have.
Bot ever murne unto the day scho die,
In the same grave quhill that scho buryit be.
Her freindis said nay, that was not all the best,
Sen it pleisit God her husband was at rest:
Bad her pas hame, and cast her to defend
Her house and barnis, to murne wald nathing me^d
Give to the pure and let the deid hyne ga,
We think it best quod they) that e do sa.
We sall ow do all comfort that we can,
Sine efterwart to cheis ow ane new man.
Cast ow to mirth and let our murning be,
For natural is, that all man anis mon die.
Scho said counsall of ow nane will I have,
For I sall die widow abone this grave.
Can e not all considder for my sake,
Sic sair seiknes, and doly deith did take
For ane small drop he saw my finger bleid,
Should I not than both into word and deid
On my persoun sum penance for to take,
The cruel deith that suffer^t for my sake.
Thairfoir good friends let put* our mind to rest
For in this grave salbe my ludge and rest
Quhill God sinder* my saull and life in tway,
Thairfoir my friends fra me pas hame away.
Than her neir friends heiring her utter mind,
Thoche in su^ part they wald with her Inclinde
Because scho was in sturt and greit dolor,
They wald sum way cast them to her plesour.
And saw scho wald do nathing bot her will,
Thairfoir they thocht the same for to fulfill.
And causit to big euin at the graves side,
Ane proper ludge quha^rin that scho micht bide
And furneis her all necessaris thairto,
In all effairis* or quhat scho had ado.
Believing weill scho wald change her Intent,
And efterwart to wirk with friends consent.
Thinking richt weill y^ scho na way wald want
Sicht of pepill, bot scho thairto wald hant.
Sa they her left into her quiet Caif,
Murning richt sair abone her husbandis graif
Their was a Law than maid in the Cietie,
Gif any man was condampnit to die
On the Gallous, for trespass and vnricht,
Than the Schiref should walk him all that nicht
In his harnes, the morn quhill it war day,
Sa that the theif should not be stollin away.
And gif sa war, the Schiref to tine his land,
And als his life to be in the* Kings hand.
In this mean time it happinnit that their was
Ane man hangit for his thift and trespass.
Than the Schiref behude that nicht on force
All in armor to walk that hangit cors,
And sa he did* how bent the nicht was called,
Quhair he watch^t their was na house nor hald
It chancit that nicht to be both wind and ran^
That in na sort thairout he micht remane:
For verray cauld* he stude of life sic dout,
And sa belyue he blenkit him about:
In the Kirkaird beside the Knichtis grave,
Ane litill licht the Schiref can persaue,
Fra the windo quhair that the Wedow lay,
Hidder he gais in all the haist he may.
At the ludge dure he knokit quietly,
And sone scho spak, and speirit quha may that be.
This time of nicht to walkin ane pure Wedow
All wobegane* in heart richt sorrofow.
He said I am the Schiref of this town,
For vecray cauld I am in point to swoun:
Ercept e let me in mair haistelie,
For verray cauld doutles I trow to die.
Gif e cum in (quod scho) I feir richt sair
That e sall eik my anguische mair and mair.
Quhilk war neidles schir gif e knew my thocht
Quod he Lady, forsooth that sall I nocht*

Zow for to craib, thairfoir have e na dreid.
Than up scho raise, mid belyue leit him in,
For verray cauld he cheuerit at the chin.
And down he sat, and warmit him at the fire*
Quhilk for to do was greitlie his desire.
Fra he was warmit and restit their ane space,
Graithlie he blent into the Wedowis face.
Quod he Lady to displeis ow na way,
Ane word with leif I wald unto ow say.
Scho said good schir say on quhat ^er e pleis
For our sayingis sall do me na diseris.
He said Lady I meruell of our mind.
To this vane wark that e should ow Inclinde,
Considdering e ar ane fair Lady*
Fresche in our flouris, on^g plesand and ^usti(...)
It war mair meit* and better be ten fald*
For to pas hame and keip our awin housha^d.
Nor heir to bide, and our self to destroy,
Daily in sturt, in murning and in noy.
My counsall is pas hame to our awin house,
Give to the pure, and gar deill greit Almous.
Quod scho good schir, gif I our wordis had knawin
Or y^ e should sic sayings to me schawin
Ze should not had into this house entry,
Because e talk of sic purpois to me.
I say to ow as I said of befoir,
To all my freindis, and I wald e no moir
Spak of sic thingis, they sink not in my heid,
Know e not weill my husband sufferit deid:
For ane small drop he saw my finger bleid,
Than think e not that I should do sum deid.
For him agane, and tak sum small penance,
That micht me cause of him have remembrance
Thairfoir I sall him lufe on sic ane wise,
That I mon lufe the eird quhair that he lyis.
And for his saik sic penance tak on me,
That quhair he lyis abone him sall I die.
Than the Schiref tuik leif and up he raise,
The ^eirest gait unto the Gallous gais.
And quhen he come the theif that he left their,
Was stollin away, quhairof he maid greit cair.
And said often times, quhat have I done allace,
Heir is to me becum ane cairfull case.
My gudis, my geir, and also all my land
My life siclike is in the Kingis hand.
Sa he wandering in sturt both to and fro
And wist not quhat to do for verray woe.
Sa at the last he thocht that he wald pas
To the Lady* befoir quhair that he was.
Because scho was sa deuoit in her sell,
He trowit of her to have sum good counsel.
Than come he on as had been the first Cok,
And at the dure quietly did he knok.
Quod scho quha is that, that sa sone callis now
I the Schiref is cum agane to ow.
I have ane sturt and anger at mine heart,
And I wald schaw thairof to ow sum part.
Thairfoir hartlie I pray ow let me in,
I sall ow schaw the matter mair and min.
Howbeit it was to her sum pretty pane,
Zit up scho raise and leit him in agane.
Than he began the case all for to tell,
Quod he Lady I come to have counsel
Of ow, because I wait richt weill e know,
Quhen any man is hangit be the Law,
My office is to keip him nicht and day,
To that effect he be not stollin away.
And gif he be, my life and all my landis
Without remeid, is in the Kingis handis.
It is sa chancit quhen I was heir richt now
In the same time quhen I talkit with ow,
The theif quhilk I should have walkit quhill day
Sum subtell handis hes stollin him quite away
Quhairthrow I will Incur the Kingis feid,
Lois all my landis, and also tine my heid.
Or ellis on force forth of the Realm to fle
Quhilk is but dout ane heuie race to me.
Beseiking ow our counsall give me to
Into this race quhat e think best to do.
Quod scho good Schir for ow my heart is me.
That sic ane chance should happin upon ow so.
Bot sen e have maid our first mane to me.
I mon ow help, defend and als supply.
Sa wald kindness, courtasie and ressoun.
Of ane woe heart for to have compassioun.
Quod he Lady I lippin on ow na les,
Bot for to have our counsall and kindness.
Because e ar in greit estimatioun,
In wit, wisdom, and als in deuotioun.
And I believe to have our counsall now
For all my cause clean I commit to ow.
For it is said sen first the world began,
Their is greit help into ane good woman.
This Lady than was mufit with mercy.
And on this Knicht her heart had greit piety.
And said good Schir our sturt it mufis me,
Bot tak good heart, and e sall helpit be.
Do my counsall, and schortlie to conclude
Ze sail nouther lois our life landis nor good.
He said Lady that erand brocht me heir,
To save my life, my landis, my gudis and geir
Quod scho Schir will e promeis faithfully.
Quhen I have done, that e will Mary me:
I will do all that I have to ow said:
Quod he Lady of that I wald be glaid.
Wald God in heuin to me e wald sa do,
That I micht be our persoun fallowis to.
Considdering I am bot ane pure Knicht
And e ane Lady of greit blude and of micht.
Wald e disdabe to humbill our mind to me,
I should ow serve with all humility.
Sa both their minds and all their hail Intent
Was weill aggreit, quhairof they stude content
Good sehir scho said, e know richt weil I wait
How my husband was buryit of the lait,
Quha lufit me sa wonder weill in deid:
That for ane drop he saw my finger bleid:
He tuik in heart sir sturt and displesour
Of doly deith he sufferit the schairp schour.
Ga tak him up for to be our releif,
And hang him up quhair hangit was the theif
The Schiref said fair Lady be the Rude
Zour counsall is substantious and good.
Than past they both bauldlie with mane and micht
Forth of the grave they drew yt new deid knicht
The Schiref said it ane thing feiris me,
The theif quhilk I gart hing upon the tree,
Two of his ceith above was strikkin out,
Thairfoir I stand into ane dreidfull dout:
Gif any man the samin should persaue,
That this deid Cors his ouir teith dois have,
It war my deith, and callit greit dissait,
Thairfoir to do heirof not weill I wait.
Scho said our self may richt weill that remeid
I give ow leif, strike three out of his heid.
Quod he Lady to that I war richt laith,
For of Knichtheid it is aganis the aith.
Outher oldin or deid man for to strike,
It wald greithe both faith and fame Infek.
And als quhen he was lenand heir on life,
Except only my barnis and weddit wife:
I lude him best of any man leuand,
Thairfoir in him I can not put my hand.
Gif e will not now ding them out said scho
Faith for our lufe that same thing I w^il do.
Sa with ane stane two of his teith out dang.
Sine bad the Schiref hing him quhair the theif hang.
The schiref said it I feir a greit thing,
The theif quhilk I on the Gallous gart hing
Ane hiddeous wound he gat in his foirheid
At his taking, they had at him sic feid.
And both his luggis they stowit quite him fra
And our husband be he not euin richt sa
It should be my destructioun haistelie,
In this matter I pray ow counsall me.
Amang the rest (quod scho) that's bot ane bourd
Can not our self peirthe draw out our sword,
On the foirheid strike him as best effeiris,
Quhen that is done, than cut of both his ciris.
Quod he Lady fra that God me defend,
Considdering unto his life's end
I lude sa weill, and had in company,
In that behalf I pray ow pardoun me.
And of befoir I did to ow declair
Of clean Knichtheid the aith it is contrair.
Give me the sword (quod scho) and for our luf^
That same to do now peirthe sall I prufe.
Scho tuik the sword, and to the man was deid
Ane cruel straik scho gave him in the heid:
With the same sword into her greit dispite
Of both his luggis belyue scho maid him quite
Sine said good schir now e may without tarry
But any feir him to the Gallous carry.
And hing him up quhair the theif hang befoir,
Sa ax e quite of danger, sturt and schair.
Tha^ said the schiref it ane thing restis in thotht
Thairof quhill now remembrance had I norht
How beit the theif was haill in bowk and banis
Zit weill I wait he wantit both his stains.
And be that kend, all is for norht that's done
Quod scho in faith the stanis he sall want sone.
And with ane knife the stanis scho tuik him fra
And said good Schir now to the treis him ta.
He cu^meris us for to bide sa lang heir,
Quod he my self alone dow not him heir.
Quod scho in faith for that it sall not stop
Tak e the taill, and I sall tak the cop.
For sen he come forth of his Sepulture
I have him maid ane laithlie creature.
To the Gallous their two him cuik but moir,
And hang him up quhair the theif hang befoir.
Than was the schiref of the Kingis danger quite
Be the greit help of this Lady sa quhite.
Than said scho schit, now wonder weil e know
How that e war be ordour of the Law,
Both life and landis in danger for to tine,
And now I have brocht all to ane good fine:
Be my counsall and only for our lufe,
For our pleasure and als for our behufe.
Quhairfoir sen e in all matters hes sped,
Now I desire agane e wald me wed.
Conform to our conditioun and promis,
Quhilk in na sort I wait e will not mis.
Hesaid Lady forsooth I maid ane vow,
That I should not Mary woman bot ow:
Sa lang as e war leuand upon life,
Bot w^ to him that hes the to his wife.
Thou schameles schrew, and may wickit of all
Eenefull tiger a vengeance on the fall.
Ane Nobill Knicht thou had to thy husband,
And for ane drop of blude forth of thy hand
He had sic lufe and Inwart favor to the,
For sturt thairof at schort causit him to die.
Thou in na way all his lufe regarding.
His forder teith trewlie thou did out ding.
In his foirheid ane fell wound did thou strike,
Cuttit his luggis, and als his stanis siclike.
Quhen I think on this vgsum vilanie,
God me preserve that I not Mary the.
And for that cause I find the sa cruel,
To him alone that lufit the so well.
In time cu^ming thou can na better be,
To any man that wald lay lufe on the.
Thairfoir I sall that thou sall schame na ma
In time cu^ming, my a win handis sall the sla.
And sa at schort he put her their to deid
He drew his sword and quite straik of her heid.
The Master said than to the Empreour,
Schir I require gif it be our plesour:
Gif that e have the wordis of this taill taken
The Empreour said e Master every ane.
Scho was ane wife the worst and may cruel
That I befoir of any it hard tell.
The Schiref als rewardit her the thing,
That scho deseruit, to her deidis according.
T^t good Master hartlie I ow beseik,
That I man anis my Sone blyithlie heir speik
For that wald make sic blyithnes to my heart,
Fra that time forth I cair not to depart.
He said my Lord and pleis our Majesty,
That thing the morn e sall both heir and se:
At our pleasure, as our self dois desire,
In audience befoir the haill Impire.
And sall know weill the cause of vnkindes
Betuix us seum, our sone and our Empres.
The Empreour said gif that thing cu^mis to pas
Than our rewaird salbe quhat e will as,
He said my Lord all is at our plesour,
Sa tuik his leif than fra the Empreour.
MORALITAS.
INTO this taill that the Doctor hes tald
We may persaue sentences monyfald
Pertening to wemens vnstabilnes,
First their a win will to have ay that they wald,
That gart her big abone the grave ane hald
For to make knawin her feneit halynes,
Quhilk sone was tur nit to babist brukilnes.
Considder sine how that scho was sa bald
In diverse sorcis, and schew her cruelnes.
First scho her schew to be in estimatioun,
Ane chaist wedow, and leif in deuotioun
In godly prayer, and into almous deid
Quhilk sone was turnit in greit dissimulatioun
Of her a win spous that maid sic mutulatioun.
Quha de it because he saw her finger bleid,
Quhat gave scho him for his good lufe and meid
His stanis, his luggis, scho stowit, and teith out dang
Sine on Bailous as ane theif did him hang.
Heir is her lufe, heir is her stabilnes
Heir is her favor, heir is her faithfulues
Heir her chaistnes, heir is her Cherit^e
Her courtasie, heir is all her kyndnes,
Her woman heid, lo heir is her meikues,
Heir is her hope, heir is her honesty,
Heir is her grace, heir is her gravity,
Heir her gans^ll, heir is all her gudnes,
Now all is changeit into kene cruelty.
O meruellous God quhat may this matermene
That women ar sa cruel and sa kene.
And ever geuin to wickitnes and vice
In former (...) ever mair se hes been,
And in na sort can it thairfoir abstene:
Ba^ perseueiris, this is ane matter nice.
I think it best to play them at the dice
The neirest way in this world is I wene
To sane their schame, set them on sink and sice.
Quhair should be faith, their schaw they ^eneitnes
And quhair favor they schaw unfaithfulness.
Quhair should be rest, they rattill ay in a rane.
Quhair lufe should be, their schaw they bitterness.
Quhair piece should be their schaw they up valdues
Quhair gudnes is their ludgeing have they naue
Quhair tene and tray that house is to them tant
Quhair meiknes is than they ar mens^es,
O maryit men for ow I make greit mant.
For quby our heidis ar still bound till ane staik,
And thocht e do all e dow for her saik
As ow (...) both into word and deid
And sa daily on her service dois va^k,
Scho countis not all our cunning worth a caik.
Quhen ever scho craibis, and castis bakwart the Creid
Euin is the Kniche saw his wyfes finger ^leid,
In l^fi^ labor quhen ever that e Inlaik.
All thing by gane scho countis not worth ane threid.
Because they ar sa kittill of the Came
Quhylis like a wild wolf quhylis as a Dow alstame.
In at bosum and sine out at our sleif.
Sic saules thingis hes nouther sin nor schame,
Than we do wrang any way th^me to blame
They w^ll do nocht that will ^hair husband grief
Nor skant^^r spe^k without he give her leif.
Sic Innocentis that wai^ of nocht bot Ill
They covet nocht bot ay to have their will.
Sum makis sa moy sa gymp sa dynk and dane
Howbeit e sucik sc^o will not blenk agane
And gif^^ho do it ^o out on the side.
Tha^ Fillok wald be at the fe^d als fane

Thocht scho be braw ^ic and ^usuit like ane bryde

Ane fule fulfill it of fantasy profane.

All this becuinis of the greit Devil of hell
Quha baylie set: is his curage for to quell

Ane praise to the Scuint Master.
THOU hes put of Doctor ane doutsum day,
The seuint and last quhairin may perrell lay.
And sauit the Child unto the morn quhill ^one
Now in Goddis name let him cum on away
To the Empress gif he hes ocht to say.
To say it out, I think it war weill done
For scho hes been to him Inoportune,
In his contrair scho hes done that scho may
To gar him mis both Denne^ and Disione.
Ane Exclamatioun to the Child.
NOW sen thou speikis on her thou wreik it weill
Gif thou hrs cause, thy self thou hes sum feill.
Thank her na mair than thou had hangit been,
G^f thou hes hap now hit her on the be^^l
And spair her not thoche scho war stif as steill
For scho hes been to the richt wonder kene,
Quhilk in na sort pertenit to ane Queen
Qu(...) ane wise a oung Clerk to gar keill
Quha wroche never to her it tray nor tene.
How Dioclesiane on the Empress complenit, And him excusit of all matters scho
menit.
AFTER that the seuin Masters all about
Had sauit this Child of all danger and dout
Be good ressounis, of storeis red and seen,
Upon the morn togiddr^ did contiene
To ane counsall, to se how weill they miche
Eonuoy this Child unto his Fathers sicht.
And fra presoun how best they fuld him bring,
All to consult they past for the same thing.
Sa to presoun they come with ane consent
To speik this Child befoir the none they went
His opinioun and counsall for to heir,
Quhat he wantit that they seum should him leir.
Richt weill besene in honest Qrnament.
Of his Maisteris twasum befoir him went.
And on Ilk side of his Maisteris eid ane,
And three behind, and sa fordwart ar gane.
And fourtene men in their compauie went
Ilk ane playing on diverse Instrument.
And every ane was Master in Music,
For Melody and mirth their was nane sick.
To the Palice this Child they did conuoy,
With greit blyithnes, mirth melody and Joy,
Sa that the sound of all the Instrumentis
And the greit noyis in at the windois wentis.
Quhat was the noyis, the Empreour did deme^d
They said it was his sone cu^ming at hand,
Unto our grace, for to excuse him sell,
Of part of plaintis, quhilk sum did to ow tell.
The Empreour said they tythandis lykis me,
My sone speiking ^if I micht heir or se.
In the Palice this oung Child tuik entres
Quhairof money maid mirth and mirrines.
And quhen he come to his Fatheris presence,
He hailsit him with dewlie reverence.
With honor favor, and all humility,
As him become, or culd of courtasie.
The company, and all about was glaid.
With greit blyithnes to his Father he said.
Hale Father deir, health honor and weilfair
Be to our grace, for now and ever mair.
Sa sone as he of his sone hard the vois,
Into his heart it did him sa reiois:
That his greit lufe his wittis it did confound.
That he for Joy flatlingis fell to the ground.
Than up agane his sone tuik him in haist,
And diverse times in his arms he him braist.
Sa with sweit wordis and co^fortabill brasing
Fra swoun agane he did his Father bring.
Als sone fra swoun the Empreour did walk,
The Child began to his Father to talk.
Zit of pepill their was sic confluence,
The Child to speik micht scarce get audience.
The Empreour he causit cassin be,
Greit sowmes of gold out throw the hail Cietie
To that effect to draw the pepill away,
That he micht heir what thing his sone wald say
Of the money it sum tuik small regaird,
That the ou^g man sa fane they wald haif hard
The Empreour he cryit give audience,
In pane of deith Ilk man to keip silence.
Tha^ all was clois, to speik their durst na man
Sine for to speik Dioclesiane began.
My Father deir humbly I ow beseik,
That e will cause or I ma wordis speik,
Zour awin Empress with her fair Ladeis gent
At my sermon Ilk ane to be present.
The Empreour Incontinent gave command.
That the Empress should hidder cum fra hand.
With her La^^s of her Chalmer Ilk ant,
To hit velpue the Messinger is gane,
And in all haist the Message taid her till,
And schew to her the Empreouris mind and will
Scho heiring that scho tuik ane felloun feir,
Was na renield, bot all they did compeir.
Than did the Child desire the Empreour,
That all the Ladeis of the Empress bour
Should stand on raw, Ilk ane at vtheris side,
In pane of deith that nane chain self should hyde
That the pepill micht all them pla^^lie se
Their trim makdome, and als their honesty.
Their favor, yair face yair fame and yair fassou^
Their brave hauingis and their pamtit persou^
Thon the dess they damis quhe^ ya^ war dreum
They war may like Angellis cu^ forth of heum
They war sa sweit su^ said they war all sanctis
True men them callit als trun as termigantis
Than stude they up all into plane presence,
And to the Child gave oppin andience.
Than said the Child Father lift up our Ene,
Behald how lang that e have blindit been
(...) out Empress that is our Maryit guene
And that oung wenche that all is cled in grene
Quhilk is bout Maid unto our awin Empres
Quhome scho hes ^air in favor and kindness,
Than ever scho had I dar w^^ll tak on me
Sen they first met than to our Mairstis.
Quhome I desire gif ^t plesit our grare
To be ^^^led befoir ow in this place.
That being done, richt weill e sall persaue,
Sic ane bout Maid, and sit Empr^^e e have.
To quhome answer^t this Nobill* Empreour,
Thou knawis sone it is not my honor,
It will be schame to me and to us all,
Ane naikit Maid befoir us for to call.
Than said the Child ane Maydin gif scho be
All the greit schame thairof beis laid on me,
Gif scho be not ane oung Maid as e tell.
Than let all schame remane still with her sell.
The Empreour than commandit that be done,
The Officers they vnbecled her sone.
The clais of taken, it weill appeirit than
It was na Maid, bot alwayis was a man.
And be all signs of memberis natural,
Quhairof money had wonder greit meruall.
Than said the sone with all humility,
The verray treuth now Father e may se,
Of the falset, and the greit subtelnes
Of this Rebald, and als of our Empres,
How day and nicht hes ow in blindness led,
Quhen they best thocht hes ay defoulit our bed
In our Chalmer ay vsit sit harlatrie,
Fornicatioun, Huredome, and Adultery.
Not regarding Goddis Law nor conscience
Nor our dreddour, our lufe and reverence:
Bot ever mair their lust and their plesour,
Tuik quhen they list, to our greit dishonor.
Quhen the Empreour saw all the verity
How this oung man was cled as ane Lady,
And vsit nichtlie in Chalmar with the Queen,
For verray wraith, Impatience and tene
His Ene they glowrit, and als his face it swel^^
His greit anger their is na man can tell it.
He commandit them both Incontinent
Without mercy to be condampuit and brint.
Than said the sone Father remane a time,
Quhill I reprufe her of the cruel crime
Scho laid on me, and falsely on me brocht,
The thing yat I had never in mind nor thocht
The Father said that thing and all the rest
Is in our handis, do with it as e think best.
Than said the sone, ane lier gifscho be,
Than let the Law correct her for her lie.
Bot e sall know quhen e first for me sent,
My self I past and spyit the Firmament.
Quhairin I saw, ane word gif that I spak
Within seuin dayis, that I with schame and lak
Should thoill the deith with all greit cruelty
Be any way that culd deuisit be.
And that alone be the greit foirthocht feid
Of the Empress. Imagining my deid.
That was the cause Father I durst not speik,
Thairfoir pardoun at ow now heir I seik.
And quhair scho sayis that I wald her oppressed
That is in treuth ane lesing manifest.
Bot crewlie scho did all that in her was
In all kin sort to bring that thing to pas.
And quhen stho saw that I refusit sic thing
And answerit not. Incontinent did scho bring
Paper and pen, with Ink scho had reddie
Prayit me to write my mind their quyetlie.
And quhen I wrait, and all her mind refusit,
And praying her for to hald me excusit:
For I wald not defoull my Fatheris bed,
Than the writing under her feit scho tred.
Sine raif her face, and all her robbis rent,
And with loud voice scho cryit Incoutinent.
And it that crime scho laid alone on me.
Father in treuth this is the verity.
Quhen the Empreour this tail hard til him tald
The Queen's face greithe he did behald,
With awsum vult, angry and als austeir.
And not but cause, saying on this maneir.
O may filthy and schameles creature:
Micht thou na way stancheit thy foull nature
With my body, and with thy Rebald knaif.
Bot in like sort my awin sone thou wald haif.
O wickit wife never taking regaird
Of thy awin schame, nor of heavenly rewaird.
Had thou taken heid quhome of you was discendit
Thou wald never sa far to me offendit.
Thou wrocht alwayis that ever thou culd Invent
On the Gallons to gar my sone be schent.
And ay thy mind with falset was Infectit,
Traisting all time sic wald not be correctit.
Bot God is Just, howbeit he thoill a time,
As he thinkis cause he will puneis the crime.
Thairfoir because of sic thou had na schame,
Upon thy self sall ly both wite and blame:
That me sa lang thy bedfellow hes blindit,
Thairfoir thy flesche for sic faults now fall find it
Tha^ gruiflings swyith scho fell upon her face
Down at his knie, and at him cryit for grace.
Saying good Lord, for thy Princely piety,
To me may vile thou wald grant sum mercy.
For my greit gylt heir planelie I confess,
Grant me sum grace for thy greit gentilnes.
Than till her said this Nobill Empreour,
Quhilk was fulfillit of sturt and displesour.
O vile woman for mercy thou dois craif,
Quhilk be na way is not worthy to haif.
The cruel deith thou hes deseruit thrice,
Quhilk I sall schaw planelie in three kin wise.
First thou hes done the sin of Adultery,
To the greit schame and contemptioun of me.
Quhilk be the Law, expres is na remeid
(Ane Princes bed for to defoull) bot deid.
Than secundlie, my only sone and Air
Thou did provoke to be ane Adultrair.
To that effect to the Chalmer him led,
With the to ly, and to defoull my bed.
Quhilk seruis deith, as na man can excuse,
Albeit in treuth the same he did refuse.
Thridlie Ilk day with falls taillis tystit me,
Aganis Justice, to gar my a win sone die.
Because thou knew his Clergy and running,
Thy foull baudrie and filthiness wald forth bring
Thairfoir be Law thou seruis puneist be,
And of the Law to have extremity.
Than said the sone. Father richt weill e know
How scho daily tystit ow (not be Law)
Bot with her taillis and feneit falls lesing,
Upon Gallons but mercy me to hing.
War not throw help of my good Masters seuin
And first supply of the greit God in heuin:
Quhilk will ever the Innocent defend
And into neid will to them succor send.
Quhilk presently now he to me hes done,
Into my neid hes send me succor sone.
Alswa Father I traist it was ow tald
Be our Empress, that I purpoist and wald
Deprive our grace fra this Novill Impire,
Quhilk never was it trewlie my desire.
And als scho said that it was my Intent,
Zow to destroy with my Maisteris consent.
And be that way our rowmes for to obteue,
Quhilk trewlie it my mind did never mean.
Sic for to do I pray God me defend,
Or it think sic unto my lives end.
For of our grace my leuing all I haif,
Ze it on live. I aw na mair to craif.
I am our sone and e my Father deir,
Wald I ow want for any warldlie geir.
Nay, nay, not sa for I sall ay laubour
For to vphald our weilfair and honor:
At my power and utter diligence,
With heart and hand, and all good reverence.
At our pleasure, our bidding and command,
Lesting our life, ay constant sall I stand.
Bot our empress scho wrocht both nicht and day
In all kin sort to wirk betuix us tway
As the Father kest the sone in the sie.
Because the sone said him for verity:
That he should be abone his Father Lord,
To the quhilk taill the Father did not cord.
Than the Father kest the sone in the sie,
Bot the greit God gave him help and supply:
And wald not thoill that time he should be deid,
Bot throw his grace he send him sone remeid.
Zit the sonnis taill it come trewlie to pas,
And the Father ane myte not war he was.
To the Father quhat hinderance culd it be,
Howbeit the sone had obtenit dignity.
Not hindering the Father in na sort,
I think it should have been to his comfort.
And Godwilling Father my governance
Ze sall persaue sall be na hinderance,
Nor prejudice in na sort to our grace,
Bot alwayis salbe mirth Joy and solace.
Than said on heich this Nobill Empreour.
To God alone be loving and honor,
That sic ane sone vnforseruit hes me send,
To gyde this Realm after my dayis end.
Sa wise, sa good sa verteous in all thing,
To greit weilfair sa abill his Realm to briug.
Now my deir sone hartlie I the requeir,
Tell me sum taill that all about may heir.
Quhairthrow yai may thy wisdom understand
Quod he Father that sall I tak on hand.
Sa e command all men to keip silence,
Quhill I have done, and give me audience.
Quhen I have done as e think expedient
O^ our Empress give forth tha^ our judgment
Than silence was commandit to all man,
D^oclesiane thus gaits his taill began.
AFTER Tytan had taken his staf in hand
And lichtlie lap as Lord out ouir the land
Because the day was both sweit soft and fair,
Than up Irais, and past to my Librair.
And studyit their, a quhyle as I thocht good
Because it was my use and conswetude.
And sa after my lessoun was compleit,
Than to refresche, I recreat my spreit.
As for that time I laid on side my buke,
And in my hand ane other Volume tuke,
Of lychter dyte, and storyis of the ald.
That seir auld men befoir in times had tald
In quhilk Volume diverse storeis ouir kest,
That plesaud was, bot it amang the rest
Ane fine fabill in that volume I fand,
Quhilk at this time to our purpois may stand.
This was the Mairch of the matter in deid,
As e sall heir this Tale and I proceid.
BEfo(...) this time their was ane nobill knicht
Manly in mind and abundant in micht.
Ane gay Lady he had unto his wife,
And ^e^ur them they led ane Godly life.
Only ane Sone he had na barnis mo,
Quhome of ya^tu^k greit mirth blyithnes and Jo
And him delyuerit in far and strange country,
Him to Justruct and for to leit Clergy:
Of cunning men that Clergy had perqueir,
As e have done to me this money eir.
Sa this oung man as he in persoun grew,
Sa daily did in running and vertew.
Sine after that he was seum eir at ^air,
Considdering he was his Fathers Air.
And had na ma to bruik his heritage,
At scum eiris end he send for him Message.
Chargeing him sone for to cum hame fra hand
Quhilk he obeyit his Fathers haill command.
And quhen he come to his Fatheris presence,
He hailsit him with all good reverence.
As him ^ffeirit, with greit humility,
His Mother als in semblabill degree.
Quhairof they had both game gle and blyithnes
That their ane sone was cu^nim to sic grace.
For not alone in vertew he Increst,
Bot also was of body the liklyest.
Manly and stout weill maid at all fassoun.
Weill fauourit of face and good proportioun.
G^ntill, humane, courts, Nobill and fre,
All man him lude for his humanity.
Sa on a tune it chancit upon ane day,
His Father and Mother at tabill sat their tway
The sone serving them both richt courtaslie,
Fra the Kitching the coursis brocht cumlie.
In the mean time on ane tree lithtit down,
At the windo, and sang with heavenly soun.
Ane nichtingall, quhilk sang with noitis sa cleir
Sa wonder sweit, that all her noitis did heir.
Aucht dayis in ane they wald never thocht la^g
To heir that bird, sa done sweit was her sang.
Than said the Knicht weil war he all his dayis
That understood quhat one bird singis or sayis
Than said the sone Father with our honor
Sa that it be to ow na displesour.
The birdis sang I sall declair to ow,
Bot I am feirit that e tak sturt thairthrow.
The Father said sone for my bennesoun.
Quhat the bird siugis make Interpretatioun.
Say on bauldlie, for na persoun tak feir,
For I thairat sall na wayis change my cheir.
Than said the sone this is the verray taill,
That e Father heiris of the Nichtingaill.
That I sall be sic ane man of greit miche.
And honourit be with Lord Barroun and Knicht
And sall cum to, that e my Father fre
The water plait that e sall hald to me.
And my Mother befoir me scho sall stand,
Beside our self with towell in her hand:
Waitting quhill I wesche my handis in y^ plait
This is the sang that the bird sang of lait.
The Father said thou falls misleirit knaif,
Thou sall of us sic service never haif:
Nor never sall cum to sic dignity,
That we two sall make sic service to the,
Sa in malice, and into greit wodnes
In greit fury, and unnatural kindness,
He led his sone, and kest him in the sie,
In displesour, Inuy and cruelty.
Saying after in the sey he him slang
Ly thou their still, gessar of birdis sang.
The Child culd swym, and sa chancit to land
With heill and quert helpit be Goddis hand.
And fastit their as the history sayis.
But meit or drink be the space of four dayis.
On the fyft day be chance ane schip come by,
Quhairon schairplie richt loud the child ca^ cry.
Skipper of schip for lufe and cheritie,
Fra this perrell I pray ow to save me.
The skipper hard, and belyue drew to land,
And saw the Child and in quhat stait culd stand
On him they had reuth and compassioun,
Seeing he was ane liklie good persoun.
The chance of deith sa narowlie eschewit,
All in ane voice their hartis upon him rewit.
And in on burde belyue did him ressaue,
And in far landis to their country did have.
Than to ane Duke of that country him sauld,
For ane greit sowme of money to them tauld.
And as this Child grew daily into age,
In like manner he grew in personage.
Meik and humane, in manners comfortabill,
Gentill, Jocund and to all game richt abill.
Sa to all men he come in sic favor,
The Duke him lude, and tu^k at him plesour.
Into sa far, he had the haill credence
Of all his house, and the preemmence.
In the same time the King of that country*
All his greit Lords and counsall callit he.
His greit Barrouns his knichts and nobill men
That of his mind sum part that they wicht ke^
Amang the rest cum did this Duke also
To the counsall preparit him for to go.
And with them tuke this Ehyld in company
For his wisdom and his greit courtasie.
All their Lords come with full greit reuerenc^
Befoir the King gave dew obedience.
Chay being all togidder sa conueint,
To name in plane ye king schew quhat he meni^
Saying my Lords and my true Barrounis all
Now to counsall for this I did ow call.
The matter is sa greit I have to tell.
Thairfoir I wald e keipit all counsel
Gif ouy man the treuth will me declair,
I him prount my douchter and mine Air:
Into spowsage* and after me be king,
Quhen I am deid* for ay to bruke my King.
This is the treuth, and matter inufis me,
About this place resorts Rauins three:
And followis an quhair ever I gang or lyis
Rowpand in ane and ever on me cryis.
Quhylis me behiud, and quhylis they cum befoi^
With siclyke luks, as than wald me deuoir.
They leif me not bot ay contmuallie,
They rowp they rair, and ever schouts on me.
Scraipand the eird and waffand with yair wings
D^wbing their nebbis and at the windois dings
Thairfoir I send gif any of ow did know,
The cause heirof, that e wald to me schaw.
His good rewaird he sall not ntid to craif,
As I have said the same thing sall he haif.
Sa he deuoyd the Rauins fra me all clean,
And in my sicht that they na mair be seue.
Quhen this was mufit to all the counsall their
Their was na man the questioun culd declair.
Than said this Child to his master the Duke
The man on hand that one same questiou^ tuke
For to declair wald he get his promis
Fra the kings grate ea, quod the Duke I wis
Than said the Child gif it plesit our grace,
To schaw the King. I sall declair the case.
Under the pane to put my heid in pledge,
As he hes said for to fulfill the wage.
Quhe^ y^ Duke hard this tail he was richt glaid
Incontinent past to the King and said,
And pleis our grace their is ane oung man heir
Ane cunning Clerk, in Clergy richt perqueir.
Wise and witty, and of Ingine richt hie,
Quhilk promisis that he sall satisfy:
All our desires and the samin fulfill,
Tuitching the Rauins, sa that it be our will,
For to compleit the thing that e have said.
Faith (quod the king^ thairof I will be glaid.
Than brocht the Duke this Child into presence,
Befoir the King with all good reverence.
Than said the King, oung wan can e declair
The guestioun that I proponit air:
Befoir my Lordis, tutching the Rauins thee
Than said the Child that sall I do trewlie.
Sathat our grace our promeis will fulfill,
Than said the King but don't trewlie I will.
Quha ever will this questioun declair,
H^ sall mary my douchter and mine Air.
Than said the Child this is the cause and quhy
That their three Raums dois daily on ow cry.
Their was two Rauins, ane female and ane mal^
That had clekkit the third withouttin fale.
Quhair they clekkit into that Ilk country.
Was greit hounger, derth and penuritie,
For fault of fude, women and men deceist,
In like manner sa did both foull and beist,
Than this oung Rauin being intill her neft,
The Mother flew ouir feilds quhair scho thoch^ best
S^iking her fude, in la^d out ouir all quhair
And of her bird scho tuik na sturt nor cair.
Than the Male Rauin seeing that displesour,
Dyon him self he tuik daily laubour
With panis and pine, and greit penuritie,
Fed this oung Rauin quhil it had strenth to fl^
And fend the self out ouir the feildis fair,
Sa of Mother it tuik na sturt nor cair.
Now is past by the skant time of the eir.
Meit grew at large and vittaillis was not beir
Men beist and foull, had meit abundantly,
The Female Rauin come hame than haistelie.
And wald have had sit freindschip and kindness
To the oung Rauin as he quhilk mdistres.
Fed him with fude quhill he cuid fend him sell,
The Female Rauin thairof tuik na travel,
Than the male Rauin tuik weil into her thoch^
How he his bird had nureist and vpbrocht,
In time of derth, penuritie and skant,
He thocht na way his bird that he wald wan^
For the Female out ouir the feildis flew,
And left her bird but help or it reskew.
Still in the nest quhilk thairfra culd not fle,
Bot their on force for to ly still and die.
Thairfoir the male thocht he had mair kindness
To the oung Rauin, that in neid and distres
Out of perrell it nureist and vpbrocht
Nor the Female that flew and fed it nocht.
Thairfoir the Male sayis that he should posseid
His a win oung bird that helpit it in neid.
Rather than scho quhilk in necessity,
Left it alone but help in point to die.
Than the Female alledgis this agane,
That in the birth of her bird had mair pane:
Mair laubour, forrow, and penuritie,
Mair hounger than the Male had be sic three.
Thairfoir of him scho aucht to have mair mirth
That had of him sit sorrow in her birth.
For this Jikcaus my Soucrane Lord the King
Their Rauins cryis, and for nane other thing.
Desiring ow to Judge be our wisdom,
Quha this oung bird sall bruik in time to rum
Thairfoir will e on this thing give sentence.
They will na mair cum in our grace presence
Than said the King because that the Female
Left her aidin bird into sit neid and bale,
And in na fort wald nureis it nor feid,
Bot fra it fied quhen that it had may neid.
I think alwayis with ressoun it should stand,
The bird should be at bidding and commaud:
With the Male Kauin, and in his company,
Because he fed it in necessity.
And quhair that scho alleges her agane
To have mair sturt, sorrow travel and pane
In his clekking, forth bringing and his birth,
I say to ow all that was turnit in mirth,
Sa sone as scho her a win bird quick culd se,
Scho quyte foret her greit adversity,
And als the male is cause of productioun,
And Instrument of all generatioun,
I say also in time of her greit neid,
He did his bird with pane nureis and feid:
Quhen the Female it left into the nest,
In greit hounger, and als with called oppressed.
Thairfoir I give diffinitiue sentence,
That the Male Rauin sal ay have still presence
The fellowschip and als the company
Of the oung bird, quhair ever he gang or fle.
And the Female his fellowschip sall want it,
Except the Male unto the Female grant it.
Than quhen y^ Rauins hard the King sa declair
Incontinent they flew up in the air,
With sic ane noyis, as it had thunder been,
And was na mair into that Regioun seen.
This being done, in schort time after than,
Incontinent the King callit this oung man:
And said good friend our name to me e schaw
Alexander (quod he) Schir they me caw
Than said the King e sall tak nane bot me
For our Father and e my sone sall be.
For e sall have my douchter in spowsage,
And after me sall bruik her heritage.
And ever still sall heir be Lord and King
And all this Realm sall have in governing.
Than Alexander in houshald still he baid,
Daily service unto the King he maid.
All men him lude for his greit courtasie,
His gentilnes, and his humanity.
He was sa soft, sa humbill and manswrit,
Courts running, debonar and discreit.
In all good games him self he did frequent,
In horse, harnes Justing and turnament.
And all good games ganit for ane gen^^ll man,
Daily exercit, and ay the praise he wan
Abone all them that dwelt into Egypt,
He far excellit, and had the Maisterschip.
In all that Realm nouther be far nor neir,
In manly actis their was nane found his peir
Nor it their was na greit obscure questioun,
Bot he thairto wald give solutioun.
Sa he gydit in all thing and weill prufit,
With oung and auld wonder weil he was lufit
In this mean time ^ytus the Empreour
Quhilk was a man of greit micht and honor
Of gentilnes, and als of courtasie,
In all vertew he was ane A per se.
Ouir all the world sa far rang his renoun,
That he precellit all other that bure Croun.
Into sa far, that ouir all quhair did fle
His Nobill name of Liberality.
And round about into all partis him by,
Both far and neir oppinlie garc he cry:
Gifony man in manners and wisdom,
And good Ingine, unto his Court wald cum:
Should be Intreit into their awin degree,
And rewardit after their faculty.
Quhen Alexander hard tell of sic ane thing,
He past fra hand to his Father the King.
And said to him kneiling upon his kne,
And pleis our grace my Nobill Father f^^.
The Nobill Court and courtasie is knawin
Of the Empreour, and to our grace is schawin
That every man delites their to abide,
That hes knawledge outher to gang or ride.
Leirning sall leir, manners and manlynes,
Prettick of weiris, good gyding and proves.
Dew Intreitting, with honor laud and (...)
And greit rewaird he sall obtene thairfo^^.
And pleis our grace I wald desire hartlie,
Into that Court and company to be.
That I micht wit and vertew daily leir,
My self exerce in Nobill actis of weir.
This of our grace richt humbly I desire,
Na wayis mening that of our grace I tire.
For God willing I sall return agane,
To our pleasure, quhilk is my Souerane.
Than said the King our talking plesis me,
Bot laith war I to want our company.
Zit not the les cause e sic thing desire,
I will glaidlie grant it that e require.
Bot or e pas se that e furneist be,
In all behalfis, gold, clais, horse and money.
That e want nocht that is neidfull to have,
That e pairthrow may both our honors save
Siclike I think it war expedient,
That e should spous my douchter or e went.
Or e return perchance ane barn forth bring
Than wist this Realm outher of queen or king
Alexander than said unto the King.
And pleis our grace to spair me of that thing
Till my return, than sall I with honor
Zour douchter spous with our graces plesour
Than said the King of that I am content,
Euin as e will, thairto I do consent.
And grantis ow heir with all benevolence,
To pas our time quhair that e pleis license.
Than Alexander at the King tuik good nicht,
And all y^ Lords both Barroun squire and knicht
Sine last of all he past to the Lady,
Tuik his good nicht, and gave her knifes three.
Bad her be blyith, for lang he thocht not bide,
Scho said good schir I pray God be our gyde
Sa forth he fairis, ane liklie man to luik,
And lay on horse, and on his veyage tuik.
And with him went ane honest company,
With gold silver, furneist at all plenty.
Unto the Court quhair that the Empreour was
He takis Jornay, and sa fordwart can pas.
And quhen he come befoir the Empreour
Upon his kneis he hailsit him with (...)
Greit reverence and all humility.
Bot sa sone as the Empreour culd him se.
Quhair that he sat, out of his sait he raise,
To Alexander but mair tarry he gais.
And kissis him, as was of Court the gise,
And in his arms he him Imbrasit twice.
Sine him inquirit quhat was his name fra hand
Quhairfra he come, quhilk was his native land
Siclike he speirit quhairfoir that he was cum.
Tell on he said, the treuth of all and sum.
He said and pleis our Nobill Majesty,
Alexander men vsis to call me.
The King of Egypts sone and Air I am,
I wait his grace will ratify the same.
And is cum heir unto our Majesty.
To do scruice, gif e will accept me.
Ze at welcum the Empreour said than,
Ze seem to be ane Nobill gentill man.
To his Stewart than ane command he gave,
That in houshald Alexander he should ressaue.
The Stewart than to ane Chalmer him led,
And schew him quhair that he should have his bed
W^ill perfurneist into all necessaris,
With pertinentis thairto in all effaris.
Alexander behauit him sa wisely,
With all the Court and Ilk ma^nis sufe wan he
Sa in schort time for his weill behauing,
Master ^^ruour he was maid to the King.
Not lang after the Kingis sone of France,
To do service and daily observance.
In like manner come to the Empreour,
Quho^e he ressa(...) with blyithnes and honor.
And speirit siclike at him quha^ was his Nai^e
He said Lodwik all men callis me at hame.
And am ^um heir to do our grace service,
Gif that e pleis witchaif on me office,
The Empreour said Alexander trewlie,
Is my ^eruour my copper e sall be.
For that office I think e be may abill,
To do service daily befoir my tabill.
Committit he to the Stewart Lodwik,
To do to him, as to Alexander siclike.
Sa the Stewart to Lodwik did assing
That Ilk Chalmer was Alexanders ludgeing
Quhairof they war both verray weill applesit
That they war^wa (...)ne Chalmer esit.
Their two oung men Alexander and Lodwik,
In all kin sort they war sa wonder like:
In face fa^our in form and fassoun,
In stature, visage, speiche and conditioun,
That Ilk man said ane was the vthers brother
Sk(...) micht nane know the ane be the other
B^t Alexander in deidis was mair acriue,
Than was Lodwik and far mair scientiue.
For Lodwik was schamefull and fe(...)e,
And Alexander peirt furthie and Masculine.
Of mair curage, mair manly to behald,
Than Lodwik was (sum said) be the third fald
Their two, oung men Ilk ane sa lufit other
Nane wald have said, bot ane was vlhers brother
The empreour quhilk tytus hecht to name
Had ane douchter of fassoun fair and fame.
Hecht Florentine ane gracious gay Lady,
Quhilk neirest air to her Father should be.
Quhome her Father lufit sa above measour,
And till her gave abundance of treasour.
Her aw(...) s^ruandis scho had with h^^ ^o dwell
And kei^it Court and houshald be her sell.
To quhome daily the Empreour vsit to send
Of his dainteis his douchters meis to mend
In sign of lufe, daily ane dische or tway,
And Alexander to her bure them away:
To this. Lady, befoir her them presentit,
Sa in her sicht Ilk day he was frequentit.
Quhairthrow favor of this Lady he wan,
For his wisdom above all other man.
Throw besines it chancit on ane day,
At dennar time Alexander was away
Fra his scruice, and nane in his absence
His fault suppleit nor it gave attendence.
Than Lodwik come and that persauit s(...),
Did sic service as Alexander should have (...).
And stude for him into the samin steid,
His fault he did supply and als remeid.
And quhen dennar neir hand it was at end,
The Empreour tuik up ane dische and send
To his douchter as he had wont to do,
And bad Lodwik the same dische beir her to.
Believing weill Alexander it had been.
Few culd discern their two visages between.
Than went Lodwik his way to the Lady,
Presentit her the dische upon his knie:
With reverence as he in heart best thortht.
For he befoir that time her seen had nocht.
Incontment quhen he the meit her brocht:
Scho persauit that Alexander it was nocht,
Quod scho good schir to me e schaw our name
He said Lodwik, it is surely Madame.
Quhais so^e ar e tell me but circumstance,
My Father is (quod he) the King of France.
Quod scho good schir I thank ow of our pan^
Ze ar welcum to pas or it remane.
Thank my Father of the meit he hes send,
Quod he I sall, and sa forth can he wend.
And tuik his leif with all good reverence,
And past agane to the Empreours presence.
In this mean time Alexander come to tabill,
Did his service as he was wont and abill.
The dennar done, Lodwik to Chalmer past
Richt seik at heart, and laid him down bedfast.
Quhilk Alexander persauit Incontinent.
And to Chalmer to Lodwik is he went,
And said to him, O my good companeoun
Qu(...) is the ^aus that e ar now line down?
Than (...)d Lodwik, I feill my self trewlie,
Vexed at the heart with sair Infirmity.
Greitlie I feir without I get remeid,
It haldis me sa, that it sall be my deid.
Alexander said the treuth I traist to ges,
The principal cause of all our ^air seiknes.
For this Ilk day quhen that the meit e bair.
To one Lady, quhilk that e thocht sa fair.
Ze her beheld sa verray fervently,
Her good manners, her visage and beauty,
That e thairwith is hangit in her lufe,
Fra her our heart na way e c^n re(...)fe.
Than said Lodwik O my good brother deir,
The verray treuth but dout e have gane neir.
All Physicians in world they culd not ges,
Nor Judge mair crew the cause of my seiknes.
Quhairof but dout I tak ane felloun feir,
Get I na help, that it sall do me deir.
Than Alexander bad him be of comfort,
At my power I sall our pane support.
Lift up our heart and be of good curage,
Sturt in na way our seiknes can assuage.
Than Alexander bethocht him on ane cast,
Incontinent to the market he past:
Ane precious claith with his awin gold he bocht
Quhairof lodwik knew na way nor wist nocht
All set about with precious stanis coistlie,
And presentit unto the fair Lady:
Quhen scho it saw, scho askit him in hy:
Quhair he culd get sic coistlie claith to by*
Quod he the sone of the may Christin King,
Hes for our lufe Madame send ow this thing,
Bot for a sicht that he saw of our face,
He is sa fast lynkit in lufis lace.
That he lyis seik without he get remeid,
Appeirandly their is nathing bot deid.
And for our lufe suffer e him to die,
It sal degraid our honor gretumlie.
Alexander scho said, wald e now counsal me
That I should lois my clean Virginity.
Cousiddering I am of blude Royal
Discendit down of stock Imperial
And secundlie, as e know weill in deid
Be apperance to this Croun should succeid.
Gif I did sa as e to me declair,
Than war I tynt: but dout for ever mair.
Believe e weill that e for sic Mestage
Sall have na thank nor wyn of me na wage.
Thairfoir pas e fra hand out of my sicht.
Zour message is nouther ressoun nor richt.
He saw the Maid was sum thing discontent
Forth of her sicht he past Incontinent.
On the nixt day past Alexander agane
To the market, and playit the counterpane.
To this Lady he bocht ane fine heid geir.
Above the claith it was three times mair deir.
And present it unto the Lady gent,
On Lodwyks name, thairwith unto her went:
Quhen the Lady this coistlie gift had seen*
Scho meruellit greit quhat Alexander did mean
And said to him I meruell of a thing,
That e to me sic coistlie gifts should bring
Fra o^^ man, bot gif it war our sell,
Des^rring ay our awin erand to tell.
And sa often times e have had my presence,
And for to speik e nucht have had license.
Sir thing I se in our heid never sank
Quhairfoir but don't I cun ow the les thank.
Quod he Madame e mon hald me ereusit,
I ourst nor speik perchance e had refusit.
And (...) my birth it is to law,
Sa heich matters I durst not to ow schaw.
Quod scho it is ane Proverb of the ald.
Quhilk I often times in mirrmes hes hard tald.
Let ane oung man quhidder he speid or nocht
Have not his speich bot speik forth and spair nocht
Into my heart quod he sic was not groundit
Nor with sic thing my heart was never woundit
And gif sic thing perchance had happinnit me,
I wald have chargeit ane o^ mair law degree
Nor is our grace, bot my good friend Lodwik
Is the greit air of the ma^t chief (...):
Of all the world, and themaist Christin King,
The mair baulder he dirst desire sic thing.
Rather nor I quhilk may be na compair,
Unto our grace, for o^^ blude singulair.
Quod scho this word i^ remembrance e tak,
Lufe quhome e like, they say lufe hes na lak.
Quod he quha hes inte his company,
Ane good fellow, as Lodwiknow hes me:
And in him traistis am I ^t bound agane
To wis him good quhair that he lyis in paue
At my power in sa far as I may,
Doutles madaine I culd ^ot say him nay.
Thairfoir I think e Lady traist and true
Wald e witchaif upon Lodwik to rue,
And on him have compassioun and piety,
That is sa sair woundit in our beauty.
Ane word of ouris wald make him haill agane
And him releif of all seiknes and pane.
Let him na way his deid be on ow laid,
For that thing sall our honor greit degraid.
Gif e absent fra him our gnde kindness,
Ilk man will say that e ar mereyles.
Scho said good s^hir forsooth e serve greit crime
Of me e get na answer at this time.
Thairfoir e may pas on fair weill adieu,
Ze ar to blame sa schairplie to persew:
For ouy man, bot gif it war our sell,
Pas on our way, as now na mair I tell.
He tuik his leif, and departit anon,
The morn agane to the market is gone.
And bocht ane belt, quhilk ten times was mair deir
Nor was the claith and als the gay heid geir.
And presentit unto the Ladyis sicht,
On Lodwiks name, the woeful woundit wicht
Quhen scho persauit the giftis sa coistlie was,
Into her self scho kest aid did compass
Seir diners thochts yatneids not to be schawin
Nor to Ilk man in na knde to be knawin.
Thairfoir as now I think best let them be,
Ilk man should not know Ladeis preuitie.
Bot at the last to Alexander scho said,
I wait not weill f^r to be mufit or glaid
At our Message ^ot wonder says war me
In my default (...) man should die,
A maunis life to (...) for laik of lufe,
Gif I sa did I war greit to reprufe.
Thairfoir e sall in this point have credence,
In my Chalmer I will give him presence.
At the third hour that past is ouir midnicht,
My Chalmer dure he sall find oppin richt.
Schaw e him sa this is my mind and will,
Z^ur mind (quod he) Madaine I sall fulfill.
Of this answer Alexander was glaid,
Past to Chalmer, and to his fellow said.
Lodwik (...) not, e lurk ouir lang for lufe,
I have not hanit to hant for our behufe:
The company of one fa^ Lady gent,
How beit sum time scho stude not all content.

Her greit favor to ow I have purchest,
And I believe all is cuin for the best.
Thanfoir be ^lyith and tak ow good comfort,
With clean curage now get ow up at schort.
And in secreit I will ow schaw ane thing,
To her Chalmer this nicht I sall ow bring.
Quhair that e sall richt wonder welcum be,
And weill Intreit with that fair gay Lady.
Fra he that hard he was curageous,
Both haill and feir. Jocund and Jolyous.
Als blyith at heart, and sturt away was worn,
As ever he was, fra first day he was borne.
Was never bird sa blyith of her brydgrome,
Was never bird sa blyith to licht on blome.
Nor it Sparhalk sa blyith to get her pray,
Nor it the Lark, in fresche morning of May.
Never Menstrell sa blyith of his rewaird,
As was Lodwik, quhen he they tythings hard
Bot for to speik of perfect Potingaris
Fy^e Physicians, meruellous Medicinaris.
Cler(...) of cunning, and counsallouris of hele,
Charmers of chafts and giuers of Liblele.
I never red into na buik nor place,

Howbeit often times into greit Jeopardie.
For Lodwiks saik Alexander was trewlie.
Bot to Lodwik sic was not k^awin a deill,
Bot the Lady it (...) richt wonder weill.
Than in (...) time their was a message send
Out of Egypt, be writing makand kend,
That of the lait was new deceissit their King,
Quhilk abone them money ane ^ir did Ring.
Requiring hame Alexander to cum,
And with honor ressaue his awin Kingdom.
For his Lady the Kiugis douthter and Air
Of his absence tuik both greit sturt and cair.
Because the Realm was desolait of ane heid
Unto that hour, sen her Father was deid.
Quhilk sone he schew to Lady Florentine,
And thairefter to Lodwik schew it sine.
Than he in haist behuifit to depart.
Quhair of they war both wonder sad in heart.
Also he past unto the Empreour,
And said plesit our graces greit honor.
Forth of Egypt I have ressauit writing.
Makand it kend my Fathers departing,
And it behuifis me to pas, and ressaue,
The Croun thairof, be richt thairto I have.
Gif that our grace will licent me to pas,
Without our fa^our I will na license as.
For but ^^ur leif or I should license take,
I had rather both Croun and Realm forsake.
In their effairis, quhat ever plesis our grace,
Of verray treuth sa standis euin the ca^e.
The Empreour said e sall know verralie.
Of our depart my heart is richt heuie.
For I held ow amang my seruandis all.
Into my house ever the principal.
Bot it becu^mis not to ane Empreour,
Into na sort, nor it is his honor
To his seruandis to make Impediment,
Quhat time they be promouit to any rent:
Bot far rather to help them and supply
To greiter giftis, and hier dignity.
Thairfoir ga e fra our Stewart ressaue
Als mekill gold as e pleis for to have:
With my blissing, and with my Inwart heart,
In Goddis Name I leif ow to depart.
And bad fair weill and sa he tuik good nicht
At the Empreour, sine at Lord squire and Knicht.
Quha was sorry of his schort departing,
For he was lude both with the auld and ing.
Than past Lodwik, and with him Florentine,
And on gaitward conuoyit him miles nine.
Alexander wald let them na farther go,
Bot for to se the dolor and the woe:
Quhen they departit, quhairto should I say mair
It wald have maid ane haill ma^nis heart richt sair
For verray woe to ground all three fell down
And Florentine for woe scho fell in swoun.
Alexander than tuik her up agane,
Comfortit her of her dolor and pane.
And richt sa did to his fellow Lodwik,
Comfortit him with money wordis siclike.
And said to him, now my fellow and brother,
Quhome I lufe best of men above all other.
In time cu^ming for to keip ow fra skaith,
This I ow say, and to my Lady both:
Tuitching secreitis that is between ow two,
Keip tha^e quiet or e will suffer woe.
Thairfoir tak heid and t^nt richt weill about,
Do e not sa, e stand both in greit dout.
For weill I wait ane other in my ste^^
Sall cum but dout, and have ow at sic feid.
With greit haitrent, dissait and als Inuy,
Both day and ^^cht sall ow chak and espy.
To se gif they can chalange ow with crime,
Thairfoir be war and tak good tent in time.
For gif they can reproach ow any way,
And ow rebuke, swyithlie they will assay.
With the Empreour in fauouris e do stand.
Thairfoir the mair they will cast at our hand
Than said Lodwik in sa far as I may,
I salbe war, both be nicht and be day.
Bot woe allace thairin quhat sall I do.
Quhen I have nane that I dar lippin to.
That I should want our treuthfull company.
I can not mend, thairfoir full wais me.
Zit harthe I require ow of a thing,
Ze will ressaue fra me this litill Ring.
Betuix us two to be in remembrance,
Of two Princes of Egypt and of France.
Alexander said the Ring I will ressaue
In remembrance of ow still for to have.
Bot it howbeit the Ring I had not ta^e.
Zour remembrance fra me na way had gane.
And sa ather about the nek Imbraist,
With greit kindness and sine about the waist.
Bot Florentine was sa confound in Spreit,
Scho culd do nocht, bot sat her down to greit.
Alexander said amendis now na greting,
Bot I pray God send us mirrie meting.
And sa partit with hartis wonder woe,
Unto their hame, Ilk ane their gait did go.
Not lang after the Kingis sone of Spane.
Come to the Court in service to remane.
Namit Gwydo: and gat that Ilk office,
That Alexander had into service.
Als the Stewart to him he did assing.
That samin house, the Chaliner and ludgeing,
That Alexander and Lodwik dwelt intill,
Quhilk was but, dout all aganis Lodwiks will
Howbeit the same na way he culd amend it,
Bot it his heart thairwith was sair offendit.
Lodwik to gyde culd keip na fellowschip,
As he did to Alexander of Egypt.
Thairfoir Gwydo aganis him tuik Inuy,
Howbeit they both in ane Chalmer culd ly.
And Lodwik had of Gwydo sickin feir,
That he durst not to the Lady ga neir:
In adventure that Gwydo should espy
Of his secreitis, and them in oppin cry.
Zit not the les of her he had sic thocht,
Her company to abstene culd he nocht.
Nor it scho cuid his company weill want.
Sa he agane sum times to her did hant.
Than Gwydo that persauing was not sleuth,
On them to wait, quhill that he knew yt treuth
That Lodwik had with Lady Florentine,
Sa greit kindness that he thocht after sinc:
Considdering weill the treuth sen he did know,
Sum time unto the Empreour he should schaw.
Sa in his mind he held it quyethe,
With falls dissait, quhill he his time micht se.
Upon ane time the Empreour in his hall
Talking about amang his Novillis all.
Praising greitlie the wit and gentilnes
Of Alexander, the wisdom and kindness.
And said he was both true verteous and wise
To gyde ane house richt weill he culd devise.
Than said Gwydo and pleis our Majesty,
Sa far praisit he aucht not for to be.
Nor for to be commendit as e wene,
Ane greit tratour in our house he hes been.
The Empreour said teil on how can that be,
Than said Gwydo I sall ow tell trewlie,
To our douchter e have ane Lady fair,
The quhilk should be appeirandlie our Air:
And be the help of falset and supply
Of him, Lodwik hes done her velanie.
And sa nichtlie quhen Lodwik takis delight.
He hes his will of that fair Lady quhite.
And all this come be the false subtell flicht
Of Alexander, that he wrocht day and nicht.
Quhen the Empreour this tail hard til him called
Into his mind was muifit monyfaid.
In that same time Lodwik come throw yt hall,
And upon him the Empreour sone did call.
And said quhats this that I heir tell of the,
Gif it be true thou salbe hangit hie.
Than said Lodwib and pleis our nobil grace
Ze will me schaw thairof how is the case.
Than said Gwydo in oppin audience,
Heir I auow in our graces presence:
That Lodwik lyis with Lady Florentine.
Als sure as standis on craig this heid of mine.
And sa he hes defoulit the blude Royal,
Quhilk I sall preif on him in plane battle:
On his body and thairaf sall I stand,
Defend it now, gif thou dar tak on hand.
Than said Lodwik plesit our Majesty,
I am saikles of one he sayis on me.
And richt falsely he layis on me sic crime,
Quhilk I sall preif quhen ever he thinkis time
Sa into God I traist to find remeid,
All his falset sall fall on his awin heid.
Than kest Gwydo his gluif donu for a trane,
Lodwik lowtit, and tuik it up agane.
Saying I will that Ladeis fame defend,
With heart and hand unto my life's end.
The Empreour than to rhame both did assing
Ane certane day of battle and fechting,
And to them both he bad silence and rest
And bad them pas quhair that they plesit best
Than past Lodwik to the Lady fra hand,
And all the case he gart her understand.
And how he was accusit in presence
Of her Father, in oppin audience.
And how that he assignit the fechting day,
And unto her in this manner can say.
Now Florentine my Lady fair and gent,
It me behuifis to wirk with auisement:
With ow alwayis for sa the matter standis.
I can not chaip vndeid of Gwydois handis.
For quhy gif I had nayit to him battall
Than had I ald my self all criminal.
And of the crime grantit my self gyltie,
Thairfoir forte was to counterfute mellie.
Alswa Gwydo is wonder stout and strange.
In fait of arms he hes been vsit lang.
I never knew in na company heir,
Bot Alexander to fecht can be his peir.
For I am waik and febill of persoun,
And to his strenth hes na comparisoun.
Gif I him meit in field quhat salbe than,
Without refuge I am bot ane deid man.
And sa on me sall ly the cause and blame,
And e for ay sall thoill sclander and schame.
Than Florentine to Lodwik this can say.
Sen sic ane chance is cum betuix us tway.
And I feill ow dispairit in ane part.
And in this case ouir waik spretit in heart.
Zit not the les quhair two Illis dois approach
I think it best fra the greitest to foche.
The first Ill is, fra e ow gyltie grant,
Than sal I ay both wealth and worschip want
And e also be put to cruel deid,
And I for ay my life in langour leid.
The secund is, gif e to battle boun,
Ze ar sa waik and febill of persoun.
And Gwydo is sa strange and als hardy,
That e dow not ganestand him straikis three.
And sa alwayis I can find na remeid,
How ever it go their is to ow bot deid.
Thairfoir heirin e sall my counsall do,
Ze sall but let my Father sone pas to:
And schaw to him on our may humbill wise,
That our Father upon his deid bed lyis.
Quhairof their is new writings cum ow till,
Desiring him, gif that it be his will:
To prorogat the day of battle set,
That e may gang, and cum agane but let.
And in mean time with our Father to speik.
Be the ressoun he lyis sa wonder seik.
And for to ken his perfect latter will,
That in all pointis the same e may fulfill.
And for to speik with him two wordis or three,
Forth of this world or he depart and die.
And that e may his bennesoun obtene,
With his awin mouth, sine e to lowk his ene.
And quhen e have obtenit his license,
To Alexander in all good haist pas hence.
And secreitlie to him the matter schaw,
How all thing standis, perfitelie let him know
And him require into this extreme case,
That he wald cum and to supply our place.
Contrair Gwydo, with him in battle fecht,
Because our self to do the same hes hecht.
This counsall than it plesit Lodwik weill,
Euin as scho said, sa did he every deill.
License obtenit, and als prolongit the day,
To Alexander Lodwik tuik his Jornay.
Small rest he tuik, bot raid on day and nicht
To Egypt land, quhill he come unto richt.
To the Castle than come he on in hy,
Quhair that the King good Alexander culd ly.
Quhen the King gat of Lodwik knawlegeing
He meruellit greit the cause of his cu^ming.
Incontinent to meit him is he gane
As his brother, euin sa with him hes taken,
With all honor he did him their ressaue,
As him become, or he lykit to have.
Than said Lodwik my deir brother and friend
In tunes bygane, and ever it hes been.
Now at this time I let ow understand,
My life and deid lyis both into our hand.
He said brother make knawin to me our querrel
Tour life salbe Godwilling in na perrell.
Than said Lodwik, e remember e schew,
At our parting, sum wordis quhilk I find true
Saying I should in fellowschip ane have
Into our steid, perchance wald me dissaue.
And ly in wait my secreitis to espy,
Quhilk now in deid richt wonder weill find I.
Ze said without I war mair circumspect
In quhilk my self in sum part did neglect.
For ane Gwydo the Kingis sone of Spane,
Into our steid with me he did remane.
And be ressoun my secreitis he not knew,
To my Lady I durst not lang persew.
And sa at lenth I culd not lang abstene,
It chancit him know the secreitis us between:
And me accusit befoir the Empreour,
Quhilk unto me was utter displesour.
And hes promeist in battle to make good,
That I defoullit the hie Imperial blude.
Sa hand for hand in battle we mon fecht,
To counter him be my hand I have hecht.
This day aucht dayis the battle should be done,
Quod Alexander forsooth that is ouir sone.
Als quod Lodwik Gwydo is stout and strange,
And hes been vsit in actis of weiris lang.
And I am waik and febill as e kend,
Fra his greit dyntis I dow not me defend.
And Florentine thairfoir gave me counsall,
Zow for to schaw the cause and matter haill.
For scho beleuis ow ay her faithful friend,
And hiddertillis sa ever mair hes been.
And traistis doutles e will help and supply,
Both me and her in this necessity.
Than Alexander to Lodwik can he say,
Is their any know is e come heir away?
Bot Florentine (quod he) forsooth not ane,
For Ilk man trowis that to France I am gane
For to vesie my Father lyand seik,
Their same wordis to the Empreour I did speik.
To that effect he did prolong the day,
And I at poist to ow am cum away.
Quod he schaw forth quhat Florentine bad desire
Or quhat at me is thing scho bad require.
Or quhat counsall gave Florentine to ow
That I should help, in quhat manner and how.
Than Lodwik said, O my may constant friend
This stands the case I traist that scho did mean
Considdering we two be sa done like,
That e should cum with Gwydo battle strike.
And nane knawing bot Florentine allane,
The battle done, e to cum hame agane.
And I siclike in Court to present me,
As I had done the Act and Jeopardie.
Alexander said the battle e have set,
This day aucht dayis to fecht withouttin let,
It is to schort, for euin this stands the case,
I can not weill be reddy in sic space.
For tarry I the morn withouttin mair,
I can not find that I may weill be their.
Thairfoir but dout quhat I sall say heirto,
I can not tell, nor wait nor how to do.
And my subiectis I have commandit haill,
That they be heir the morn at my brydaill,
Keip I Jornay, thocht I ride at the poist,
Of my wedding the day is tynt and loist.
Gif I ga uot, and keiyis not the battaill
Than Florentine and e ar loist but faill.
Thairfoir Lodwik quhat think e best to do,
Quhat e devise heir I apply thairto.
Lodwik heiring the excuse ressonabill.
To fall in swoun quhair that he stude was abil
Began to sich, and sorrow monyfald,
For to his heart catchit was carris called.
Saying all tray and tene to me betydis,
Sorrow and cair now cu^mis on all kin sides.
Persauing that Alexander till him said,
Let be sic sturt^^ak comfort and be glajd.
For I will not forsaik ow this vepage,
Thocht I should vaith tine wife and heritage.
Bot e sall heir in thocht quhat I have taken,
Into fa far as we twaar like ane.
And as e ken it is not lang age
The Empreours Court hidder sen I rome fro.
Zit I am not weill know in in this country,
Money my Lords as it hes not seen me.
And lor that cause they ken not my presence,
They will tak ow for mein my absence.
Thairfoir heir sall e tarry and abide,
And in my steid e sall Mary my bryde.
And hald the Feist with greit saleinynitie,
And gar all thing be done that done should be.
^owbeit my self in body be absent,
Let nathing want mair than I war present.
To my Renoun pertenis or honesty,
Gif I for ow, do e siclike for me.
Except only quhen that e pas to bed,
With my awm wife, howbeit that e her wed.
Into my Name, and my Authority,
Into that care se that e faithful be.
And sa but baid I sall Incontinent
Loup upon horse and to the bartell went.
And set my cors for ouris into the field,
And our actioun debait with speir and scheild
And gif that God grantis me the victory,
For to v^ncus Gwyde our Enemy.
Without carry I sall return agane.
And e sichke ur Court for to remane.
As e had done the principal act our sell,
Sa with honor in Court still sall e dwell.
This being done Alexander tuck good nicht,
Latting na wit unto his Lady bricht.
Unto the Court fra hand tuik his Jornay,
Ha man knawing the matter hot they tway.
Sa Lodwik baid at hame, still with the Queen
Into Egypt, as Alexander ic had been.
And on the morn Lodwik with novelty.
Past to the Kirk in greit solen^pnitie.
As it had been Alexander the King.
And sponsit his wife at the Kirk with ane King
Na man knawing bot Alexander it had been,
That had spousit with greit honor the Queen
And held the Feist with mirth and mirr^us,
Greit honor, gloir, triumph laud and blyuhnes
All menstralie of Music was yair their.
Wantit nathing of nurth quhat wald e mair
Of meit and drink it neidis not for to sperk,
That neidfull was their was nathing to seik.
All the greit Lords and Nobills that was pair
They maid greit mirth and solace suigulair,
Sine quhen nicht come all men bow^^t to rest
To ga to bed the brpde scho thocht it best.
Bot quhen Lodwik past to bed with the queen
Aue naikit sword he laid them ewa between.
Ouhairof scho had ane greit meruell and wonder
On the first nicht, that they should ly asonder.
Sa he Ilk nicht with the Queen did remane,
Her bedfellow quhill her king come agane.
Nathing scho said, bot it mekill scho thocht,
Be the ressoun the treuth that scho knew nocht.
Now let Lodwik and the Queen bide at hame
And we will speik of Alexanders fame.
Thau come belyue the day of Tornament,
Alexander to the Empreour he went.
And said O may redoutit Soueraue,
Unto our grace now I am cum agane:
Left my Father in greit Infirmity,
Douting nathing bot schortlie he sall die.
And to debait this battle with my blude,
And with my handis my querrell to make good
For Godwilling to all it salbe kend,
That I Justly my querrell sall def^nd.
The Empreour said e do all that e can,
According to ane Nobill gentill man.
And believe gif our querrell be richt,
Ze sall triumph like ane kene cruel Knicht.
Fortoun will favor our querrell and actioun.
Nowbeit e fecht contrair ane Campioun.
Than quyethe he past in under cure,
To Florentine the hie gait fordwart fure.
Of quhais cu^ming scho was richt wa^der glaid
Scho him Imbraist, sieve kissed and after said:
Blist be the time that e ar cu^min heir,
Fra all dolor to mirth hes changeit my cheir.
Ze ar als welcum to me now our allaue,
As any man on life excepting ane.
For ay with me e tnik sa true ane part,
Quod he Lady I thank ow with my heart.
Quhair is Lodwik, I pray ow to me schaw,
And how he dois, I waid e leit me know.
He said Lodwik was into greit Uyichnes,
In mirth and Joy, and in greit mirrines:
Their is na man leuis in mait lusty life,
For he hes now maryit ane gay oung wife.
Maryit (said scho) I think that can not be,
It is for treuth forsooth Madame said he.
Euin on the morn after I tuik veyage,
It was assignit the day of Marriage.
The Banker was prepairit richt weill I ken,
And callit thairto was money Nobill men.
All thing was dressed, their was na mair ado,
Bot on the morn the Kirk for to ga to.
The Lady said quhat woman may that be,
He said forsooth scho is ane gay Lady.
Lusty of lufe, richt bounteous and fair,
Of that country scho is appeirand Air.
Ouod Florentine schort kindness their hes been
Or ellis auld lufe that hes been them between
Bot gif sic thing that Lodwik now hes wrocht
Zour cu^ming heir I think it is for nocht.
Her countenance to keip bad fill the cop.
How beit I trow scho list not drink ane droy.
Than Alexander persauing her patience,
Her lawlynes, and gentill countenauce.
Na langer he waid hald her into noy
Bot turnit her sturt Jucontinent to Joy.
Ouod he Lady be blyith and make na cair,
All he hes done is done for our weilfair.
Ze know richt weill is nane in world mair like
In all rassouns nor I am to Lodwyk.
Sa quhen he come and tald me his crand,
(...) ou the morn my brydail suid have stand
And be ressoun I culd not keip diet,
Nor it to bide the day of brydall set.
Because on him sa strangely come the case,
Kindness causit me to put him in my place.
Sa I causit him in my place for to pas,
Na man knawing bot the same man I was.
And wed my wife as it had been my sell,
And I to tak the chance of the bartell,
For gif that I quhill the brydall was done
Had biddin at hame, I had not cum sa sone
To the fixed day of barteil that was set,
Zit than I thocht my brydall should not let.
Sa I him left in my Realm to be King.
Quhill I returnem, and ow to honor bring.
Gif scho was blyith it neidis not for to talk,
He tuik his leif, and to Chalmer did walk.
Bot Florencine their was nane that culd tell,
Of verray treuth bot it was Lodwiks sell.
Sa on the morn the day of battle was,
And Alexander unto the field can pas.
Into sit geir as than to him effeixit,
And on his steid sa stouthe he him steirit.
Sine ^ch^^t down like ane kene cruel Knicht,
To the Empreour the hie way raikit richt.
Befoir Gwydo (...) wordis to him he said.
My greit Souerane ane crime is on me laid
Be this Gwydo, falshe befoir our face,
He me accusit befoir our Nobill grace.
Saping that I had carnal knawledgeing
Of our douchter, and her flesche defouling,
Quhilk to our grace it war greit dishonor,
And I siclyke to ow ane greit Tratour.
Bot heir I sweir and als affirms surely,
Be the greit God that bled his blude for me.
Be the Euangells that our Savior spak,
And all the michts that God in world did make*
That I never in na manner of way,
Knew our Douchter, as Gwydo did ow say.
My mind was not to do her dishonor,
Into na way, to our grace displesour.
And I this day be help of Goddis grace,
Upon Gwydo, sall preif befoir our face,
That he hes leid, in dispyte of his heart,
And all his kin, and quha will tak his part.
Than said Gwydo, it I say anis agane,
Befoir our grace, thou art a Tratour plane.
And als I sweir be God Omnipotent,
With thy awin flesche his Douchter thou hes schent.
To thy plesonr, and thy foull appetyte,
Ay quhen thou lift, or thairin had delight.
Euerilk nicht had her at thy plesour,
Quhilk was to her greit schame and dishonor.
And als unto the Empreours Majesty,
Oppin tressoun, quhilk I sall preif on the.
Upon thy heid, in contrair all thy kin,
Cum and defend, gif thou wald worschip win.
Than Heralds cryit with loud voce hie on hich^
Ga togidder, we pray God schaw the richt.
Incontinent they stendit on their steids,
Like vaileant men, into their weirlyke weids.
As two bald Bairs, togidder both they ran*
Ilk ane was like to ding down horse and man.
S^e^rs sprang like sparks as fire dois of y^ flyne
Their docht na man Endure pair doutsum dyne
Quhe^ speirs was pair pair schynig swords drew
Quhill plau and maul all into flenders flew.
their swords na^ swag quhil pair steids swat at syds
the giltin spurs y^ heual skin throw glyds
Froith ran fra fronts of the f^irs forsie steids,
Quhill horse and man both at the basnet bleids.
Styf straiks the stryke of vthers stude nane aw
Quhill Alexander at last ane wantage saw.
On Gwydois nek ane nakit place he spyis,
Quhair at gu(...)speid he stryks twyse or thrpis.
Quhill at the last, their at he straik sa lang,
All the harnes was their away he dang.
And thairefter but ouy mair delay,
He put Gwydo intill ane feirfull fray.
Gwydo that seis, agane upon him setts
Of his Gorget ane buckill or two he fretts.
And straik his Gorget down upon his breist,
Alexander ane other straik waillit neist:
Upon his nek quhilk he persauit was bair.
With all his strenth ane straik he laid on their.
Quhill both their steids stakkerit at the stound
And Gwydois held it hoppit on the ground.
Syne lychtit down and tuke it in his hand,
To the Lady it send into presand.
Quhair of scho was richt wonder blyth and glaid
To her Father the same scho bure and said.
Father behald, the held quhilk upon me,
Sa falsely leid, sic feid vnfaithfullie.
Quhilk ow and me at his power defamit*
Bot the blameles him self hes maid vnblami^.
The Empreour said the vaileand victory
Be Lodwik wrocht, is now scha win patentlie*
And said Lodwik it may be hard and seen,
Believing weill that Lodwik it had been.
For e have saift this day fra schame and skaith
Zour awin honor, and als my douchters both.
And fra thine forth the mair ay sall e stand,
In my favor. I hecht ow be my hand.
And heirefter quha ever dois ow defame,
In that behalf, he sall Incur my blame.
And at my hand salbe accusit of crime,
That sit thing talkis of ow in any time.
Than Alexander said unto the Empreour,
The victory is ay at Goddis plesour.
Quha traistis in him na way he will the^ wrak
Nor their Just cause he will not thraw abak.
Bot will alwayis defend the Innocent,
And will not thoill the saikles to be schent.
Sen he hes send to me the victory,
Thanks ever mair to him alanerlie.
Bot now my may redoutit Lord and King,
Humbly our grace I require of a thing.
Fra my Father quhen I last did depart,
He was sa vexed with seiknes at his heart,
That we beleuit nathing bot standand deid*
And now this case as e know come on heid*
That I micht not at that time weill remane*
Now I wald have license to pas agane.
To understand in quhat stait all thing standis
And thairefter to put reule in my landis.
And gif he be of seiknes conuolest,
Quhill I return I sall tak lytill rest.
The Empreour said our langage liks me weill
Bot I wald not, sa mot my saull have seill:
Want our service, nor our daily presence*
Zit not the les I grant ow good license.
For sic effairis as e have schawin to me,
To pas agane into our awin country.
Than he tuik leif, and bad Ilk ane good nicht
To his awin Realm raid haine y^ gait full richt
In this mean tune Lodwik he thocht greit la^g
To luik abont, to the wall heid did gang.
And persauit ane horse man cu^ming fast,
Sine Alexander he knew weill at the last.
Quhome quhen he saw he was both blyth and glaid,
And hartfullie ressauit him and said.
O may true friend, of all my friends on live,
Quhais greit kindness my wittis ta^ not discriu^
Ze ar welcum sa far heir as I may
How have e done, and sped in our Jornay:
Or quhat kin end that e have brocht it to,
Quod he Lodwik now e have les ado.
Nor of befoir, for Gwydo is departit,
Thairfoir be blyith and wonder mirrie hartit.
I wait I send his heid to Florentine*
To her Father scho it presentit sine.
Thairfoir ga e unto the Empreour,
For now e stand far mair in his favor:
Nor ever e did befoir in any time,
And als e ar maid clean of all kin crime.
That Gwydo laid upon one fair Lady
Tuitching her fame and our awin honesty.
Than said Lodwik it neidis me say no moir,
My life often times e have preseruit befoir.
And now my life and als my honesty,
Siclike preseruit the fame of ane Lady.
Quhilk be na way I caan not recompense.
Bot quhill I leif, all the benevolence
Of my heart rute e salbe ever sure.
Sa lang as I into this life Endure:
Togidder als with all my Gold and geir,
Sa lang as I on life is listand heir
Than they Imbraist, at vthers tuik good nicht
And Lodwyk raid unto the Empreour richt.
Na man knawing Alexanders absence.
For all his Court beleuit his awin presence.
Siclyke this Queen, nathing the matter knew,
For na man was, that sic thing to her schew.
Syne quhen nicht come, Alexandee him sp^d,
Without tarry unto the Quenis bed.
Sone in his armis he hynt her in all haist,
With fair sweit wordis richt tenderly Imbraist
With all pleasure that thairto did pertene,
Or into bed ane King do to ane Queen.
Quod scho quhairfoir sen first e did me wed,
And every nicht I lay into our bed.
Ze never schew lufe nor kindness to me,
Nor na freindschip quhil now how may yis be
For I believe e had Judgeit sum crime,
In my contrair, quhilk never in my time
I committit unto our Nobill grace,
Quhairof I am astoneist in these case.
Out of my mind it can not weill depart.
Bot still remane at the riutis of my heart.
Quod he thairat quhy at e discontent,
All that I did was dove in good Intent.
In good Intent (quod scho) their I say nay,
For eueri^ nicht e laid betui^ us tway
Ane ^aikit sword, and never count moir
Of my persoun, and knew na cause quhairfoir.
I did all that (said he) for probatioun,
And als of lufe ane greit confirmatioun:
Betuix us two of everlasting lufe,
On sic ane sort I thocht I wald ow prufe.
In all my dayis e sall not find agane,
Ane naikit sword in bed betui^ us twane.
Zit not the les the Queen said in her thocht,
In all my dayis foret it sall I nocht.
That lufe thou trowis for to obtene of me,
In thy dispite I sall it wraik on the.
Zit nocht scho said, bot thocht it in her mind,
How scho micht turn her lufe in other kind.
Their was ane Knicht that scho lude of befoir.
And fra thine forth scho lude him moir and moir.
At last they two bethocht thaine of ane thing,
How they micht best sla and distroy the King.
Betuix them two ane consait sone they fand,
Gave him poysou^, and thocht that he fra hand
Should be bot deid, and it his complextioun
It was sa stark, it tuik na Infectioun
In his entrales, bot brak forth fra his heart,
Into the flesche, and schew the self outwart.
Sa be wirking within ane schort process,
It was convert in other sair seiknes.
Vncurabill ay haldin amang us,
And turnit intill ane Lipper Lazarus.
Quhill that na man with patience micht him se
And all his Lordis dispysit his company.
Saying it is ane thing richt odius,
Ane laith Lipper for to King above us.
For all his barnis, and all his haill ofspri^g,
Withouttin faill sall have the samin thing.
And fa at schort him of all digritie,
They quite denude, for his Infirmity.
Out of his Realm as ane beggar him draif,
Quhill he behude to beg amang the laif.
In this mean time of Rome the Empreour.
Payit his dew det, quhairof was greit dolor.
Quha was Father to Florentine sa fair,
Of the Impire scho was appeirand Air.
And with auise of his counsall did wed,
Lodwik her lufe, and brocht him to her bed.
Quhairthrow he was maid principal empreour
And ga^ the Croun thairof with greit honor.
In the same ^^me of France the Nobill King,
Lodwiks Father in likewise maid ending.
And payit his det as natural course him gave,
As dois all thing that ever did life ressaue.
And sa Lodwik come Empreour throw chance
Siclike he was the michtie King of France.
Above them both atanis sa did he King,
And both atanis he had in governing.
Than Alexander quha was laitlie deposit,
Fra his Kingdom the quhilk he should have Josit
Hard tell for treuth Lodwik was Empreour,
And King of France and thairof possessour.
Unto him self he said and tuik in mind,
I will ga se gif that Lodwik be kind.
For diverse times I have Jeopard my life,
Both for him self, and siclike for his wife.
Now will I go and till him make my mane.
He will me help I am sure and certane.
Sa on ane nicht Alexander vprais,
And as he micht, purelie put on his clais.
And steppi^ forth with his staf in his hand.
With cop and clapper unto the Empreours la^d
Quhen he come their he sat down at his et.
Amang the lipper sum Almous for to get.
The Empreour come forth upon ane day,
Of his Palice to sport him and to play.
After his play agane to Palice past,
And to dennar Ilk ane they bownit fast.
All the Lipper they clappit and they cryit,
Bot at that time all Almous was denyit,
And Alexander clappit as did the rest,
Thocht they ga^ nocht to bide it he thocht best
Unto the time the Empreour was set,
Believing weill sum Almous for to get.
And up he raise, and neir the et he went,
Thairat knokit with meik mind and Intent.
The portersaid quhais that that knoks sa bald
Quod he ane pure with ow sum erand wald.
Requiring ow for lufe and cheritie
That e will do sum small message for me.
The Porter said quhome to is that message,
Few is heirin of quhome e have knawledge.
Alexander said, good friend with our plesour,
My erand is unto the Empreour.
The Porter said dois our erand pertene
To the Empreour, I wait not quhat e mean.
Schaw me the matter and quhat is our Intent
And I sall tell our taill Incontinent.
He said I ow require for Goddis lufe,
And for his saik that sittis in heuin abufe:
Ga e and cell unto the Empreour,
Ane man is heir in seiknes and dolor.
Ane says Lipper, ane Lazarus e se,
Requiris his grace for part of Cheritie.
For Goddis lufe that treat hes all thing,
And Alexanders saik of Egypt King.
That he will grant me license in his hall,
To ^it his meit befoir his Nobillis all.
The Porter said I wonder of our wit,
Within his hall that e desire to sit.
For all his hall of Noball men is f^w,
And they at meit forsooth gif they saw ow:
They should abhor, and ei^ that time no moir,
I think it best e hald ow still thairfoir.
Quod Alexander I pray ow of gudnes,
For Goddis saik, and of our gentilnes.
To our Master e wald schaw my Message
Get I almous e sall not want our wage.
The Porter said, sa far as e require,
For Goddis saik, and hartlie e desire.
Zour erand do, the same I tak on hand,
Quhill I return, se still heir that e stand.
Than the Porter past to the Empreour,
And hailsit him with reverence and honor.
Did his Message as he had gottin command
The Empreour hard, and understood fra hand
And quhen he hard namit Alexander King,
Quod he in haist that man to me e bring.
How horribill or vgsum that he be,
In all good haist e fetch him heir to me.
That he may eit his meit into my hall.
In my presence befoir my Lordis all.
Than the Porter unto the et is gone,
And Alexander he brocht to hall anon.
And ordanit him into the hall ane place,
Quhair he micht eit befoir the Empreours face
Quhen he was weill refreschit at his awin will
Ane gentill man belyue he callit him till.
And said good Schir, require the Empreour,
Gif that it be his will and his plesour:
For Goddis lufe first and king Alexanders sine
He wald me give ane Coup full of his wine.
The gentill man said that I will do to the,
Bot I believe that sic thing sall not be.
For gif e anis of his Coup tak ane drink,
To drink thairm he sall na mair I think.
Zit nor the les the erand I sall do,
Auise him self gif he cunsentis thairto.
The Message than to the Empreour he schew,
And als sa sone as he the erand knew:
For Alexanders saik the Coup he send
Full of the wine that for the best was kend.
Drank his pleasure and sine be put the rest
In his Bottall, that time he thocht it best.
Of his finger ane small gold Ring he threw,
Quhilk the Empreour lang time befoir he knew
Because the same he had him geuin befoir,
In takin of lufe and freindschip ever moir.
Quhilk Alexander into the Coup leit fall,
And bad the copper beir it up throw the hall:
To the Empreour, and the same leit him se,
Quh^ said my friend, I sall it do trewlie.
The Coup and Ring withouttin process mair
To the Empreour the copper sone it bair.
The Empreour than how sone the Ring he saw
Incontinent full weill he did it know.
And wist richt weill it was the samin King,
That he had geum to Alexander King.
Into freindschip quhen ather did depart,
Out of the Court, quhair of he at his heart:
Was sorrowful, for he knew na remeid,
Bot Alexander his companioun was deid.
Or ellis he thocht this pure man meruellouslie,
Had gottin this Ring at sum greit Jeopardie.
He commandit the Lipper not depart
Quhill he had hard mair secreitis of his heart.
For he not knew be favor na other thing.
Quhat man it was that had send him y^ Ring.
After denuar he tuik him quyetlie,
And said tell me the treuth and verity:
And fene not to tell to me this thing,
Quh^, quhair and how happinnit e on this Ring
Alexander said, and pleis our Majesty,
Quhat is the cause e speir sic thing at me?
Ze have knawledge of this King I persaue,
Gif it was ours, e know quhair e it gave.
The Empreour said richt wonder weil I know
The King and man siclike gif I him saw.
Alexander said I meruell that can be,
Ze know the Ring, and na way know is me.
For Alexander I am of Egypt King,
Sum time I was quhome to e gave this Ring
Quhen he that hard to his heart straik ane stou^d
For verray sturt fell ^^a^lings to the ground.
And rent his r^bbis, and kest his clais him (...).
Quhen he persauit Alexander was sa.
With sai^ sichingis and sobbings to him said,
My deir fellow how is this on ow laid.
Sic sair seiknes, and greit Infirmity,
My heart it brekis sic thing on ow to se.
Ze ar my life, my saull and my weilfair,
My only friend and fellow but compair.
Quhair is our cors that was sa clenelie cled,
Zour bauld body that was sa finely fed,
Zour puissant pith that was sa stout
Zour ma^ly strenth, quhairof Ilk man had dout
Quod Alexander this greit Infirmity,
And uncleanness that e se now on me:
For the greit faith, true kindness and freindschip
That e schew quhen I left ow in Egypt:
To wed my wife, their our fidelity
Causit this seiknes sa to chance upon me.
For into bed, with my wife quhen e lay,
Ane naikit sword e laid betuix ow tway
Scho believing it was not e bot I,
Sa fremmitlie with her in bed culd ly.
And for that cause had me at sic haitrent,
Ane other Squire scho cheisit in luferent.
Betuix them two purposit to poysoun me,
Quhilk is convert in this Infirmity.
Forth of my realm yai have me dreuin and chaist
And to return thairto I have na traist.
The Empreour than tuik him about the nek,
For verray lufe, and said in this effeck.
O my may best belouit true brother,
Quhome ever mair I lude abone all other.
I sorrow sair in sic sort ow to se,
Without remeid maisterit in misery.
Bot e mon thoill and tak in patience,
And gif their may be found any defense:
Help or remeid that may our seiknes save,
For gold or geir, but dout e sall it have.
We sall not faill to fetch fine Physicians,
With tu^ning Clerkis, and perfect practicians,
Nor it sall mis for money Medicinars,
Nor for payment to preif all Potingars.
With counsallis of Masters and doctors fine
For all seiknes that can give Medicine.
Into this neid gif than can ow s^pp^^^,
It sall not want for gold, geir nor money.
To get ow help we sall not spair to spend,
Thocht we should seik unto the warldis and.
Thairfoir be blyth, and tak nathing in thocht
Throw all the world our help it salbe socht.
Except our health heir nathing e sall want,
Quhen plesis God he will that to ow grant.
To ane Chalmer belyue they culd him bring,
Was weill preparit, wanting na kind of thing
Of honesty, nor it was necessair
For eis or health, quhair his bed was and lair
In this mean time the Empreour gart prepair
His Messingers to pas and seik all quhair.
Cunning Doctouris, and Physicians profound
That was expert in any land or ground.
Of quhome their come to him in oulkis three,
Threttie Doctouris cunning in all degree.
The may expert, and had experience,
In sic effairis, belanging that Science.
Of sure supply pertening Physic fine,
And was extollit Masters in Medicine.
To quhome anon the Empreour than said,
Of our cu^ming Masters I am richt glaid.
This is the case quhy I send to ow all,
I have ane friend the quhilk lyis seik and thrall
Uncurabill, quhilk only I suspect,
As is Lipper, quhairwith he is Jufect.
Quhairof gif e culd make him haill and sound,
I wald give gold money ane thousand pound.
All the riches I have and other geir,
I (...) it give to have him haill and feir.
The Maisteris said we sall do diligence,
B^ (...), Physic, and natural science:
Togidder with all possibility,
Him to recure of his Infirmity.
Pleisit our grace e mon us all pardoun,
We mon have sicht of the principal personn.
Quhilk all thret^ie at anis quhen they him saw
Incontinent his seiknes they did know.
And said it was ane seiknes vncurabill,
And to remeid to mortal man not abill.
Quhen the Empreour hard them deliver so,
At his heart rute he was richt wonder woe.
Remittie all to the help and calling
Of God abufe, that can help all sic thing.
The Empreour callit to him godly men,
Forth of all partis, quhair that he culd the^ ken,
That war deuoit with mind and thocht Inwart
Desiring them richt humbly with his heart:
That they wald pray to God of his good grace
Throw their prayer gif they culd health purches
To Alexander quhilk was ane King with croun,
Be their fasting, and als deuotioun.
And als him self fastit and prayit daily
That God micht have of his good friend piety
Upon a day Alexander alone,
Lying in bed, in heart all woe begone.
Praying to God for sum help and supply,
He hard ane voice saying to him on hie.
Alexander gif that the Empreour,
Desiris thy health, thy help and thy succor:
Let him gasone with his awin handis two,
His two oung sonnis Incontinent he sla.
The quhilks his wife at au^ burding the b^i^,
At the last time scho was in Childbedlair.
Wesche thy body with the two babei^ blude,
Thy flesche salbe als fair, als clean, als good.
As ever it was in any time beforne,
Or as the flesche of ane babie newborn.
Alexander hard, and this said to him sell.
I think it not neidfull this taill to tell.
Nor to be schawin is not expedient,
Nature thairto be na way will consent.
Na wonder war his heart for to be wa,
For ane stranger his awin two sonnis sla.
Thocht I be now in sic extremity,
Sic ane vane voce sall not be schawin for me.
Zit not the les the Empreour nicht and day
Continually at his deuotioun lay:
Praying to God to send help and supply,
To Alexander King of Egypt should be.
Sa at the last come to the Empreour,
Ane voce saying quhy makis thou mair labor
For to get help to Alexander King,
Sen to him self is schawin the samin thing.
The Empreour than to Alexander went,
Saying be blyith and mirrie in Intent.
O my good friend, sen God of his gudnes,
Hes schawin remeid and health for our seiknes
Unto our self alone sa secreitlie,
I pray ow schaw quhat fassoun it salbe.
God is remeid for all upon him cawis,
To them supply in sindrie sort he schawis.
And sen sa is, sic secreitis hes ow schawin,
I wald the same e sa make to me knawin.
To get our health gif I micht help thairin.
And to weilfair agane we micht ow win.
I cure na Gold, nor counts na warldlie geir,
Sa I agane micht have ow haill and feir.
I count na coist, nor it na other thing.
Sa ow agane to health it micht ow bring.
Hele not our mind into na sort fra me,
In any thing that may our health supple.
For micht I deill our seiknes into three,
Ze should not have sa greit Infirmity.
My wife and e the two part e should have,
And the third part, my self it should ressaue.
Knew I as e, quhair e may have support,
It to ressaue, the time should be richt schort,
Thairfoir feir not for to tell me the treuth,
To help our self, se na way a be sleuth.
Than Alexander answerit with mind sa meik,
Howbeit that I fyftene times war mair seik:
And at the point of the may cruel deid.
I can not schaw the cause of my remeid.
Nor I wald not that sic ane thing war schawin
Nor I wald not to any make it knawin.
For to be schawin it is sa odious,
And to nature sa done contrarious.
In to this case e mon hald me excusit,
To have my health, sic way quyte I refuse it.
The Empreour said my only friend and brother
Quhome with my heart I lufe abone all other.
Have me in traist, have me in na despair,
Bot the haill treuth I pray ow me declair.
The thing is not possibill to be done,
Zow for to cure, bot it salbe had sone.
Thairfoir I ow require of brother heid,
Hyde not fra me, that may be our remeid.
Alexander said, sen euin sa is our will.
The haill fassoun I will declair ow till.
With hartlie mind, hu^blie praying our grace
Sen our will is, that I schaw ow the case:
That e will tak my wordis in patience,
And pardoun me quhair that I make offense.
For e will think my wordis far by ressoun,
N^id war thairfoir our grace grant me pardo^^
Wit and ressoun my talk will both Impoung
Best war thairfoir in time to hald my tongue.
The Empreour said for his saik that ow bocht
Withouttin feir schaw me our mind and thocht
Ze sall me find to ow true and constant,
And ow to health, their is nocht e sall want.
Thairfoir schaw forth our mind gif it ow pleis
For e sall say nathing sall me diseis.
Alexander said I will pleis our Intent,
As it was schawin to me in verament.
Zit anis agane our grace I will protest.
That my schairp wordis our mind nathing, molest
Be ane greit voice it was to me reuelit,
Be ane strange way, how that I may be halit.
Zour awin two sonnis our self them for to sla.
And my body wesche with the blude of tha.
This is the way quhairthrow I mon, be haill.
Quhilk is ane thing to ow unnatural:
That the Father his awin two sonnis should keil
With his two handis, for any strangers weill.
And is contrair the course of natural Law.
This was the cause sic thing I durst not schaw
The Empreour said e faill far to me their,
That callis our self to be heir ane strangair.
For in true faith, and sa my saull have seill,
As my awin self I lufe ow euin als weill,
For gif I had ten barnis perchance and ma,
To get our health, their should not ane of tha
Sone he unslane, I schorthe ow dec^air.
Of (...) now we will speik na mair.
Ga e to^est and make na in air ado.
With help of God all to good sall cum to.
The Empreour he wa^^tit day and nicht,
And watchit about quhat time yat he best micht
Cum to his chak, his awin two sonnis to sla,
Sa on ane day the Empress forth culd ga
(...) th her Ladeis airlie in ane morning,
T^ tak pastune into ane grene garding.
The Empreour saw, and to Chalmer him sped
Quhair the two babis lay sleipand in their bed
Incontinent his quhinear forth he drew
With his two hands his awin two sonnis slew
Euttit their throttis, and sine keppit the blude,
How be it the same contrair his heart it stude.
Na meruell was how be it heart was woe.
He them begat, and was his children two.
Sine with that blude, Alexander did wesche,
With his awin hands, all his body and flesche.
Quhilk was als fair Incontinent and clean,
As any time befoir had ever been.
And als good like in parsoun and visage,
As quhen he was bot twenty eir of age.
The Empreour than knew weill be his color,
Be his fassoun, his face and portratour.
It was but dout Alexander trewlie,
Quhairof in heart richt wonder blyth was he.
For of befoir he knew bot this and so,
Quhider gif it was Alexander or no.
Bot doutles Alexander he knew,
Without despair it was Alexander true.
Kissed him and said, O my good tender friend,
Sen first we knew and ever mair hes been.
Of our persoun now I have good knawledg^,
Of our favor our fax and our visage.
Quhilk money time I delytit to se,
To eit and drink and be in company.
Blyst be the time, sic childring I begat,
That hes ow brocht to the stair e ar at.
Bot it nane wist that the Childring was slan^,
Bot Alexander, and the Empreour allane.
The Empreour said, sen God of his gudnes,
Hes maid ow haill of all our sair serknes.
I sall ordane for ow richt quyetlie,
To pas ane space ane honest company.
Out fra this place bot aucht or miles ten.
To that effect, that nane heir sall ow ken.
And on the morn e sall send me message,
Of our cu^ming, making to me knowledge.
Than sall I cum with blyth and merry spreit,
Into all haist, cast me ow for to meit.
Than still with me alwayis e sall remane,
Quhill we auise to get our Realm agane.
Of this counsall Alexander was content,
As they talkit, was done Incontiuent,
On the nirt day come to the Empreour.
Ane Messinger, quha hailsit him with honor.
Schawing to him, as he had gottin command
King Alexander of Egypt was at hand
The empress hard and was rich wonder glaid
To the Empreour scho haistit her and said.
O my good Lord, be blyth and make good their,
King Alexander they say is cu^ming heir.
Quhome with we often in greit blpthnes his b^u^
This money day by gane hes not him seen.
And wald our grace be sa good to make gai^
Him for to ineit, he wald be blyth I wait.
I and my Ladeis into our best array
Sall pas with ow, and meit him be the way.
This being done, as it nathing scho knew
That the Father his awin two sonnis slew.
The Emprrour said, gif that it be our will,
That Jik Jornay blythlie I will ga till.
Than raid they forth ane honest company,
Lords, Knichts, Ladeis, with greit solempniti^
And as they raid sa Royally throw the streit,
In the midway king Alexander culd meit.
Quha hailsit other with all humility,
With laud and gloir and honor that micht be.
Their was kindness and their was greit kissing,
Their was blythnes, yair was in arms brasig
Their was kneilling, and their was courtasi^
With reverence and greit solemynitie.
After talking with good and true Intent,
All togidder unto the Palice went.
Quhair that he was ressauit with blythnes,
With greit honor, with Joy and mirrines.
Time come of meit, all was at Tabill set,
Nathing wantit that neidfull was to get.
Alexander was fet at the hie deis,
With the Empress, and the Empreour at meis.
As they war talking into mirrines,
The Empreour said to his awin Empres:
O Florentine, my awin good wife and lufe,
I think my heart in Joy exalt abufe.
That e do make king Alexander sic their,
And is sa blyth, that he is cu^min heir.
Scho said fors^ith culd I it better make,
It should be done, for Alexanders sake.
Should not to us his cu^ming be glaidnes,
And in specia^ll to ow ane greit kyndnes.
For e had not cum to this Dignity,
Quhair e ar now, forsooth had not been he.
And diverse times als he hes sauit our life,
And was principal, that gat me to our wife.
The Empreour said, our wit weill I allow.
That thinks on them that was sa good to ow
Than I pray ow tak good heid quhat I say,
Into this hall saw e not the last day,
Ane says Lipper befoir our Tabill sat.
Both meit and drink as e saw sum he ga^.
Sine for Goddis lufe, and King Alexanders sake,
Desirit ane drink. quhilk I gart till him take.
Scho said my Lord that man richt weill I saw
Ane mair ugly it did I never know.
The Empreour said, a thing I ow demand,
Quhilk I believe e will discus fra hand.
I put the case that Lipper man had been,
King Alexander that e se with our Ene.
And his remeid and health in our hand lay,
And with the blude of our oung sonnis tway
Behude for to be bathit all about,
Wald e not than with ane styf heart and stout:
Richt weill consent that both their bludes war sched
To the Intent yat his health micht be had
Their throtts cuttit, and do them both to deid
Sa Alexander their throw micht get remeid.
And make him haill, cum as e se him now,
That I w^ld do (quod scho) God I auow:
Had we ten S^^nes go^tin us two between.
I wald consent to se them with mine Ene:
Incontinent to se them deid and slane,
Into that case to get his health agane.
They being slane with my power and pith,
M^ awin two hands should wesche him weil yair with
Rather than I should leif him in sic neid,
I wald not cure to se their throttis bleid.
For God agane micht send him barnis a new,
Bot never agane ane friend sa traist and true.
Quhe^ the Empreour their words of her hard said
Into his heart he was both blyth and glaid:
And said to her good Florentine my wife,
Had e rather save Alexanders life:
And helit of sair nor have our sonnis leuand,
Trewlie (quod scho) that heir I tak on hand.
Because thairfoir e ar to him sa kind
I will ow schaw the Inwart of my mind.
The laith Lipper quhilk sat into my haw,
That I and e both eit and drink we saw.
Scho said he was may Lipper Lazarous,
That ever come within ane Nobillis house.
I meruellit greit quhairfoir y^ thing was wrocht
Within our hall sic ane beirne should been brocht
To ow I trowit it should have done offense,
That sit persounis should cum in our presence.
Bot sen our grace sufferie sic thing to be,
I was content, and weill allowit with me.
The Empreour said, had e the treuth tha^ kend
As I believe, e had not been offend.
Good Florentine now I will make ow sure,
Quhilk man it was that sat on our hall flure.
I will ow schaw but any feneing,
Alexander it was of Egypt King.
Quhilk at our Tabill now sictis presently,
Quod scho my Lord I think that can not be.
Alexander that now sittis at our Tabill,
That is ane thing not liklie to be abill.
For Alexander that sittis heir presently,
Is haill and feir, plesand to luik and se.
Without seiknes of body sound and clean,
Blyth of visage, with two fair Cristall En^.
Curious of cors, ane cumlie Creature,
Sa was he not that sat into the flure.
Bot of his lyre was laithlie and horribill,
And had seiknes quhilk was vncurabill.
And sa is not now Alexander King,
And I meruell e should say sic ane thing.
My heart (quod he) God hes send him remeid
Throw me and ow be our sonnis deid.
My heart nor hand forsooth na aw I stude,
To cut their throttis, and bath him in their blude
Sa be Goddis grace h^is maid haill and feir,
Ane clean persoun, as e now se him heir.
Than scho began to murne and to make sorrow
As nature wald, howbeit scho said beforrow:
That scho had rathex se all her Children deid,
Into that case, or he wantit remeid.
Zit not the les the natural course and kind
In this behalf, changeit both thocht and mind
The hartlie lufe, and motherlie piety,
Quhilk nature geuis in the Mother to be.
Culd not suffer, nor it na way sustene
Bot with sair heart scho great with both her ene
And maid sorrow, as it was na meruall,
Throw kindly course, and als lufe natural.
The Empreour persauit her tak pine,
To stanche her sturt said O good florentine,
Thocht e be woe, I can na way ow wite,
For weill I know e had lufe and delight:
Inwart kindness unto our sons two,
I can weill think that our heart should be woe.
Zit not the les I pray ow ceis of sorrow
All will be weill I find ow God to borrow.
The Nurisis heir and of sic tythands,
For greit heart brek they cryit and wra^g yair hands
They wist nathing quhat for to do or say,
Past to Chalmer quhair that the barnis lay.
Believing weill of na other remeid,
Bot find the barnis in their bed lyand deid.
They fand the^ both at their pastime playing
In greit blyithnes, and giving God loving.
Never mair blyth sen first hour they war borne
Nathing knawing that their two throtis was schorne
The Nurisis to the Empreour went.
And how all was they schew Incontinent
How his two sonnis was leuand blyth and glaid
And how about both their two nekis yai had
Ane cirkill of gold quhair y^ the knife had gane,
Quhilk knife sa sone fra them the life had taken
Quhairthrow their was greit mirth in y^ Cietie
In the Palice, and all the company.
That God sit grace to her two babs had gra^tit
They being slane, their life's it not they wa^tit
Quhairfoir their was throw the cieteis and tounis
Greit prayers maid with money Orisounis.
Loving the Lord life to their babeis lent,
And grantit health to seik and Impotent.
Bankettis than maid with Joy and mirrines,
Menstrallis maid mirth, ceissit was all sadness.
Queen Florentine scho blist that samin day.
Scho did consaue and beir sic sonnis tway.
Nathing was their the space of forty dayis
Dot al kin mieth, with blychues sports and playis
Greit tornamentis, with hardy horse rynning,
Sum other dayis with grew houndis deir hunting
This being done the Empreour did prepair
Ane greit army of manheid singulair;
And past away with all their fellowschip
With Alexander agane into Egypt.
Ser him agane into his Koyaltie,
In his awin Realm with greit solempnitie.
Restorit him haill to all his possessiounis,
With dew service of his Lordis and Barrounis
That good Jo well King Alexanders Queen
In Adultrie that sa done lang had been.
With her luifer, quhat he was Knicht or squire,
As they deseruit, was both briut in ane fire.
In this mean time y^ Empreour cha^cit to have
Ane fair sister, quhome in to wife he gave
To Alexander, and fortifeit the band
Of greit kindness, quhilk ever mair did stand:
Betuir them two, of hartlie mind and thocht
Quhat that ane did, the other wald have wrocht
Sa Alexander being set down at rest,
In his awin Realm, the Empreour thocht best
For to return agane to his Impire,
And tuik good mcht at their awin hartis desire
They war richt wa to pairt e may considder,
Dot it ay still friends may not bide togidder.
Sa departit with mirrines and Joy,
Alexander on gait did him conuoy.
Sine after this Alexander him dressed,
To gyde his Realm alwayis as he thocht best
With manlines and wisdom in him sell,
He vincust all contrair him did rebel.
His enemeis about him all he dantit.
Sa throw wisdom of his will nocht he wantit
Quhen he was in all his gloir piece and micht,
Into his mind it come upon ane nicht.
How his Father in the fey did him sling,
Because he schew quhat the wild bird did sing.
And his Mother thairto did weill consent,
Thairfoir he send Message Incontinent.
How beit they did ane far way fra him dwell,
The Messinger it he bad to them tell,
That Alexander quhilk was King of Egypt,
Wald to them cum with ane greit fellow sehiy.
Eit and drink, and with them make good their
In that country sum new nowellis to heir.
The Messinger blythlie they did ressaue,
And rich rewardis sic^ke they to him gave.
Saying their service at every tune and hour
Should be reddy at that greit Kingis plesour.
How beit they war not worthy for sic thing.
For to ressaue with them ane crownit King.
Zit not the les and pleis his grace to cum,
With all our hartis he salbe richt welcum.
The Messinger to the Empreour is went,
As they him said he schew Incontinent.
And quhat reward with blythnes yai him gave
And how blythlie the King they should ressaue.
And how reddy they war at his command,
Him for to serve all time at heart and hand.
Quhat ever his grace gave them commandment
Quhairof the King was blyth and weill content
The day become the king tuik his Jornay,
With diverse Lordis to pas the reddy way
Quhair his Father and mother maid dwelling
On knawin to them of any other thing:
Bot he was king of Egypt and nane other,
Nor it nane knew of his Father and Mother.
Ercept him self quha knew weill ail the race,
And quhe^ they drew neir hand his fathers places
As they come forth rydand in their Jornay
The Knicht his Father met him be the way.
And quhen he saw the King cu^ming with croun
Incoutinent of his horse lichtit down.
With all honor and all good reverence.
Upon his kneis making obedience.
And quhen he saw his Father tak sic pane.
He tuik him up, and bad him ride agane.
Sa theik for cheik, to his Castle they raid,
Quhair their was their with all abundance maid
And quhen they come unto the Castle et,
His Mother come, and with blythnes him met.
Kneilling to him, he lichtit and her kissed,
Bot quhat he was the suith nathing scho wist.
Scho said to him sen it plesis our grace
To vesie us at this time, and our place.
Ze do to us our seruandis greit honor,
And we blyth ar that it is our plesour.
And is welcum to all that e find heir,
And as we may we sall make ow the cheir.
The time of day drew neir all downit to dine.
His Father come with ane silver Basine:
With Rois watter upon his knie kneilland,
And his Mother with Cowell in her hand.
Saying meiklie, pleisit our grace to wesche,
And thairefter with sum meit ow refresche.
It is reddy the their we dow ow make,
Praying our grace in patience it to tak.
The King this saw he smplit and sine he said
Until him self, their is nane can auaid,
Nor set on side the godly providence
He will have done be his perfect prudence.
The Nichtingaillis sang now I persaue is true
Quhilk lang ago to my Father I schew:
Quhen that scho come to his windo and sang.
That they should both be richt glaid for to gang
With the Towell and Basine in their handis,
Me for to serve as they war my seruandis.
Oif I wald thoill them sic thing for to do,
Now the same thing and matter is cum to.
This in him self he said, and na man knew,
Nor to na man as it sic thing he schew.
Sa he wald not them thotll to do sic thing,
Howbeit that time he was ane Crownit King,
Saying schir Knicht. I will honor our age,
Ze nor our wife sall do me sic homage.
It becu^mis not sic two agit to bring,
Water to wesche, howbeit I be ane King.
Tak in patience, forsuth I say ow true,
For I have heir other seruandis anew.
Than said the Knicht to us it war honor,
Sa that it war unto our grace plesour.
Bot sen case is, e will not thoill us do,
Be ressoun we are not worthy thairto.
Than said the King, I dude to honor age,
Sic office ganis to ounger personage.
Than to dennar was this good King set down,
And thairefter his Lordis of greit Renoun.
Quhen he was set he gart set down his Mother
On his ane side, his Father on the other.
Quhome Inteirlie beheld ay his visage,
Gif they culd have of him any knawlege.
Bot nane they had, seiknes, eild and laubour,
Causit them misken his fassoun and favor.
The de^nar done, the King to Chalmer went,
For his Father and Mother after sent.
Quha come to him with all obedience
Randering to him service and reverence.
He commandit all persounis pas on side,
Nane bot the Knicht and his wife to abide.
At quhais command, as he bad sa was done,
Than was the dure on them three closit sone.
Than said the King to the Knicht and his wife
Have e na barnis, quod they nane upon life.
Sone nor douchter at this time have we nane,
And to get ma, we traist the time be gane.
Than said the King I speir for time bygane
Had e any, or had e never ane.
Than said the Knicht for a so ne we had ane
Bot it is lang sen he was deidand gane.
Than said the King, in quhat deid deit he.
Than said the Knicht ane natural deid trewlie
Than said the King be that not true but faill,
Ze fault to me, and dowbillis to me our taill.
Than said the Knicht, our grace now I require
Quhat is the cause sa fervently e desire,
And to sic thing quhat causis ow tak heid,
With sic effect to speir after his deid.
Tha^ said the King, without cause do I it nocht
How our Sone deit, schaw me our mind and thocht.
Gif e will not schaw forth the verity.
Ane schameles deid but dout e sall both die.
Quhen they y^ hard they fell dou^ on their knie
Asking him grace forgiuencs and mercy.
Than said the King, it I will honor age,
I covet not of ow sa greit homage.
I grant ow leif befoir me for to stand,
And sa he raist them both up be the hand.
To that Intent I come not in our place.
Zow to betrais in any sort or case.
For it is geuin me weill to understand
Ze put our sone to deid with our awin hand.
And gif sic thing cum to the Judgment,
Ze will be both condamp^ it Incontinent.
Thairfoir to me the verray treuth e schaw,
It is danger for sic to bide the Law.
Schew me the treuth, and I sall saif ow both
Fra all perrell, and keip ow fra all skaith.
Than said the Knicht, my life schir to me grant
Of the true treuth ane word e sall not want.
Than said the King feir not the treuth to say,
And on credence heir I sall saif ow tway.
Than said the Knicht ane sone we had trewlie,
Quhilk was weill seen in cunning and Clergy
Sicker cunning he had in science senin,
In all Planetis that mouit under heuin.
He knew the course, and all their strange aspectis
Their pith power, and all their firm affectis.
All herbis and treis richt wonder weill he knew
Quhat stre^th yai had, quhat pith, and quhat vertew
Their was na foull y^ ever flew with wing,
Bot he knew weill quhe^ pai pair sa^g wald sing
Into sa far, their was na herb that sprang,
He knew the pith, and als the foullis lang.
Upon ane day befoir us he culd stand.
With Basine, Towell, and watter in his hand
In the mean time that bony foull of flicht,
The Nichtingaill, at our windo did licht.
And sa began to sing her noitis good,
Weill war the man (quod I) that understood
Zone sweet singing and quhat the bird dois mean
Quod he Father sae will not be tene:
I should ow schaw quhat one bird sings sa sweit
And every note I sall ow Interpreit.
Quod I deir sone, I pray the to me schaw,
To san the suith of na man stand thou aw.
Quod he Father, forsooth I tak greit feir,
It sall ow craib her sang quhen e it heir.
Nay, nay, (said I) of that have thou na dout,
The birds sang I pray the tell me out.
Quod he one bird scho menis into her sang,
My Mother and e ar abill to leif sa lang,
Quhill that e stand befoir me as seruandis,
And to be blyth hald watter to my handis.
Gif that I will ow suffer sic to do.
Quod I that day thou sall never cum to.
And sa at schort or ever I tuik rest,
I^to the sey for to drown I him kest.
Than said the King to ow had been na skaith
Unto his hands e had haldin watter both.
I think it had been to ow both plesour,
That our ane sone had cum to sic honor.
Than said the Knicht that same thing I co^fes
In greit fury I did it and wodnes.
W^t and wisdom was went, will was ouir man
Richt and ressoun and reuth quyte fra meran.
Sa quhen wit wants and strenth of ressoun leist
I count a man na better nor ane beist.
That rynnis on heid and lukis to na ressoun
And sa did I quhen I my Sone did droun.
Than said the King, I think it was folly,
Zow for to wyrk contrair the Majesty
Of God alone, and his greit prouydence,
His wit his will, and michtie Ordinance.
Ze micht weill wit, God of his Sapience,
That to our Soue had send him sic Science.
To know the voce of the byrds in the Air,
And it was God that causit her to cum their,
To sing that sang, as God had hirdirectit,
For in na sort scho micht na way neglectit.
Thairfoir lat nane the man may michtiest,
Cast him to wyrk contrair quhilk God hes dres^
For it passis wit power and puissance,
To wyrk contrair his michtie Ordinance.
Now e sall know the teuth and verity,
I am our Sone quhilk e kest in the sie.
And the greit God of his ni^chtie Godheid,
Hes me preseruit fra all danger of deid.
And be his grace hes brocht me to this stait,
As I am now and for me did debait.
For his foirsicht na way can be down smorit,
Bot ever mair the same will be decorit.
As worthy is for nane can wyrk contrair,
His prouydence, that schairplie I declair.
Than the Father and Mother heiring that,
For feir and Joy fell to the eird down flat.
Quhome he cuke up with all humility,
Saping Father and Mother feir not me.
Have e a dout of all that I have said,
Rather be blyth, Joyus, merry and glaid.
With help of God na danger sall ow deir,
Quhat ever e think, I pray ow tak na feir.
Ze sall nocht aill in geir nor in persoun,
Of all bygane, I grant ow plane parsoun:
For e sall find, that my micht and weilfair,
Salbe our gloir, for now and ever mair,
Into this life, sa lang as I Endure,
I have ressoun, e two me gat and bure.
Sa with blythnes, with hat into his hand,
He kissed them both, with merry heart lauchand.
Than the Mother scho great richt pieteouslie,
And the Father the teir fell in his Eye.
Than said the King, be still and weip e nocht,
For in my Realm with blys e salbe brocht.
And with all gloir their sall e honourit be,
With all blythnes, worschip and Diguitie:
Above myself except my Kingly Croun,
Ouhilk is preseruit bot to my awin persoun.
Sa in that place he left certane seruands,
To reule and gyde pair rowmes pair rents and lands
Tuke his Father and Mother with him hame,
Quhair they leuit still in honor and good fame
All their life time quhil God to deid them breast
Gydi^ the Realmein Justice piece and rest.
Unto the time course was past of nature,
Endit their lyfs only to Godds pleasure.
How the Empress was condampnit to deid.
With her Luifer but mercy or remeid.

THAN Dioclesiane said to the Empreour
Father this Tale I tald to our plesour,
Quhilk I believe richt weill e understand,
Ze every word (quod he) Sone I warrant.
It is ane taill to be notit I say,
Not ane better I hard this money day.
Than said the Sone and pleis our Maicstie,
Howbeit that God hes geuin sic grace to me:
Of wit, wisdom, and other greit Cunning,
Of diverse thingis hes lent understanding.
Zit this should not na way minische our micht.
Nor our honor, our Majesty and hicht.
Bot rather should the same elk and augment,
Be richt, ressoun, and equal Judgment.
Sa in likewise the kingis gre and estait,
Quhilk was be God only predestinait.
Send be the bird, to sing that he micht heir,
Quhilk in that race was Goddis Messingeir.
For had not been God gave that bird sic grace,
Scho had not sung sic singing in sic place.
The sonnis honor, and all his dignity,
Tuik na honor fra the Father e se.
Nor to his Mother it did na hinderance
Bot rather was their honouris to auance.
For as e hard they war honourit alwayis,
Into his Realm, during their life and dayis.
Than said agane to him the Empreour,
I persaue weill the sonnis greit honor:
Can na way pair the Fathers micht and gloir
Bot rather ay to make it moir and moir.
Thairfoir I will the haill Impire resing
Into our handis, and e thairof be king.
And gyde the same, and have the reule and steir
For I am auld, dow not sit burding beir.
Bot rather wald be set at rest and eis,
And e the Realm to gyde as e best pleis.
For I dow not Endure sic besines,
Be ressoun of my eild and fevilnes.
Than said the sone saving our graces will,
To that sentence na way grant will I till.
Bot e sall al have the Authority,
During our life, ever mair abone me,
To charge, command, to bid, and for to do,
In all effairis, that euerpertenis ow to.
All besines that are laborius,
Actis and erandis, welthie and ponderus.
Alwayis I will accept them upon me.
^ow for to serve, as is my greit dewtie.
And ever sall, the samin nicht and day,
To our pleasure, in sa far as I may.
The Empreour than commandit his Justice,
In Judgment sit, and do forth his office.
And the Empress in presence to gar bring,
With her Rebald cled in wemens clothing.
Quhilk nirt her self he causit for to stand,
Than her Ladeis in ordour at the nixt hand.
Than Dioclesiane to the Empreour said,
Father our Queen our honor hes degraid.
Ou(...) all the world e ar greit Empreour,
And it pertenis to our grace and honor:
To do Justice to all the same despris,
For the same thing our Majesty requpris
Asweill to pure, as to the rich always,
Equal Justice e should minister ay.
Now I desire that e give richt sentence,
On the vntreuth, falset and greit offense
Done and alledgeit be the Empress falsely,
Be counsall of her lufe in contrair me.
Be quhais falls meanis seuin times forth I was led,
To the Galious to leif mp life in wed.
And daily stude in greit perrell of life,
And all this come throw falsec of our wife.
Als to our grace unfaithful scho hes been
Of her body, not gydand like one Queen.
Quhilk is weill prouen into our awin presence
Be manly signs, and perfect evidence.
Upon the quhilks I ask and als despris,
Justice and richt, euin as the cause requpris.
To our Justice I wald e gave command,
To give sentence but dilatouris fra hand.
Quhen the Empress hard this sair petitioun,
Upon the eird than fell scho flatlingis down.
At the Empreour askit grace and mercy.
Bot in na sort sic thing their culd not be,
According to the Law he bad proceid,
And give sentence conform unto her deid.
And bad pans weill to quho^e the deid was done
Be quhome, quhe^, quhair, and how lang or how sone
And thairefter to make the punischement,
As pleisit the Judge to giffurth his Judgeme^t.
Than said the Judge na way I can her clenge
For her awin deid her self it dois revenge.
The perfect prufe of her Rebald and knaif,
Them self both fylis, as all man map persai^
And than the fault it is leis Majesty,
Done in contrait the Crownis dignity.
Into sa far as scho defoulit his bed,
And his ane sone to Gallous gart be led.
Thairfoir I give in oppin audience,
And pronouncis now for extreme sentence,
That the Empress be bound to ane horse taist*
Throw all the streitis of the Cietie her traill,
Quhill scho cum to the place bring for to be,
For her prepairit, that every man may se,
And their with schame and lak to end her life,
In remembrance scho was ane Empreours wife
And als we give on her Rebald sentence,
For his knaifrie, and his peruerst offense:
Contrair the Croun, merciles to be marterit,
On the Rattis reum, ha^git, drawin and quarterit
And sine his flesche forth cassin to the cykis,
To be deuorit with doggis under dykis.
And with the foulis that fleis in the Air,
The doggis leuingis to tak up to their skair.
In memory that he durst sic presume,
In contemptioun the greit Empreour of Rome.
This schairp sentence we pronounce opp(...)e,
To all pepill and dois it ratify.
Makis the same knawin to all man patent,
Asweill absent, as they that are present.
Sa war they both conform to their offense.
Done and demanit, according to sentence.
Geuin and pronou^cit than be that awful Juge
Quhairfra remeid they had nane nor refuge.
Bot suffer deith with everlasting schame,
And ay to bruik of greit harlattis the name.
As worthy was, for quhy continual siu,
With Indurit heart, ever to ly thairm:
But feir of God or any repentence,
Eausit them suffer sic doly sad sentence.
Howbeit that man sic baudrie did not know.
Zit God in heuin richt weill it hard and saw.
For all thing is to his (...) patent*
^
To make sic thing to mannis sicht be kend.
This e may se of this Empress the end.
Praying greit God of us to have mercy,
And her forgive, Amen sa mot it be.
Ane declaratioun to the Empress after her deid.
OFAITHLES febill fule, o helie het hoillit hure,
O poysonit paddokis pule, o mischant mad Monsture
Cursed catiue creature, o Satan's seid all schent,
That ever it wrocht nature, or it to life was lent.
Quhair was thy wisdom went, quhen sic fulische thou fand,
Thy lust thou may lament, that ever tuik sic on hand.
Thou hes loist life and land, and all thy Royal rout,
Thy stait na way culd stand, it was sa stinkand stout
Upon the all cryis out, fie, fie, for verray schame,
All wemens seid dois schout, upon thy filthy name:
Ay waryit be the wame, that brocht the in this life
Ever to bruik sic blame, wa worth the wickit wife:
Rutit in sturt and strife, thy bow was ever bendit
Thairfoir but sword or knyfe, thy life now thou hes endit
Sa greitly thou offendit, unto ane Innocent,
That thou wald never mend it, into this life present*
Thou wald never repent, bot wrocht wrang with Iniures,
Now with schame thou art schent, heid patroun to all hurc^
Ay q uhill this w^rld Indures, ever to bruik that name,
With all quick Creatures, with sclander lak and schame.
Frons meretricis non erubescit
Nec in ea voluptas nunquam senescit.
NOW our Empress hes sufferit deid and gane
Thairfoir as now we will let her alane
With her harlo^ ^uhais da^is they have ill spe^dit
Ane Ill (...) for commoun is Ill endit.
As (...) them ^way,

Bot schaw at schort of the good Empreours end
Within few dayis after this besines.
The Empreour he tuik ane sair seiknes:
As plesit God, and payit his natural det.
As the time come, and as the term was set.
Dioclesiane than tuik the steir on hand,
And Empreour was of that country and land
Reulit the Impire with wisdom and prudence
Held his Maisteris in daily reverence.
Be quhais counsall, wisdom and desire,
He gydit weill his kingdom and Impire.
That he precellit all his predecessouris,
In riches, wisdom, Justice and honouris.
Of his liegis sic lufe still he conqueist,
That ouir all thing in eird they lude him bes^.
His Masters als they lude him ouir all thing,
With all s(...) as their true Lord and King.
Into sa far them self in Jeopardie
They put often times to save his honesty.
And sa endit their dayis in greit honor,
In Joy and mirth, and to the greit plesour
Of God alone, to quhome all honor be.
Laud, praise, Impire, triumph and dignity.
Kingdom, Renoun, and Joy perpetual,
Loving and lufe obedience ouir all.
Health and vertew and everlasting gloir,
Into all warldis, both now and ever moir.
Be to that Lord w(...) all humility.
And ^o ^istill ane drop of his mercy
On us sinners, his gloir that we may se it
To his pleasure, say every man so (...) it.

Ane schort ^^h^wing quhair and quhen, and a^ quhais req^^^^t this buik was
translatit out of p^ois in Scottis Meter.
AT the requeist of my Ant callit Cait,
In roustie ryme this quair I did translait
Of all trun termis as e may se denude,
Because seho me protestit air and lait
All strange termis to cast out of my gait.
Saying to me scho not them understood,
Requiring als that I wald be sa good
Wemens honor to hald up and estait,
As e may se, I durst not ellis bot dude.
Sa in seuin oulkis this quair was clean co^pleie
Out of plane prois, now keipand meteris feit
Within the Fort and Tower of Tamtalloun,
Quhen the Inglis Floit beside Inchekeith did fleit
Upon the sey, in that greit birning heit.
Both Scottis and Inglis of Leith lay at ye town,
With schairp asseige, and garneist garisoun
On ather side, quhair sindrie loist the sweit*
That samin time I maid this translatioun.
In mirrines, sen my Ant causit me make it
I ow require good Reidaris for to tak it
Into patience, quhair falts ar found correct them
Zit war I laith ouir far that it war lakit.
Gif sum verse haltis or any cullouris crakit
For my requeist tak out ane pen and blek them
Because for haist perchance I did neglect them
For gif sa be* I can na way defend it
Excuse it self, and sa this quair is endit.

And hyde the, he not callit ane buik
Ga cowme the ouir all clean with coill
Sone smeir the ouir with smiddie smuik,
Or scour pottis to sum creischie Cuik:
Or in sum kitching turn the speit:
Amang Ladeis thou dar not luik
For they will on the with their feit.
For men of good thou art not meit
They will the hald of small auaill,
Quhat restis their than bot ald thy Spreit:
Or to tryit Tinklaris tell thy taill.

For honest folk few will set up the*
And I sweir be the Rude of Craill
Tuitching my part heir I deny the:
My counsall is, that thou gar cry the

All good women they may defy the
Of all thy crakis they tak na cures:
Bot f^nd Fillokis up in the Mures
Quha first ow reddis, Sym Skynnar hang them
Se on them thou wirk all Iniures,
Pas on and fend thy self amang them.

Et sic est finis
Laus detur and gloria trinis.
