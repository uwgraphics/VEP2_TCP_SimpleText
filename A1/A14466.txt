Axe / and it shall be given you. Seek / and ye shall find. Knock / and it shall be

And when thou prayest / thou shall not be as the ypocrites are. For they love
to stand and pray in ye Sinagoges / and in ye corners of the streates / to be
seen of men. Verily I say unto you / they have their reward. But when thou
prayest / enter into thy Chamber / and shut thy door to the / and pray to thy
father which is in secret: and thy father which sees in secret / shall
reward thy openly. And when ye pray / babble not much / as the heathen do:
for they think that they shall be heard for their much bablynges sake. Be not
ye like them therefore. For your father knows whereof ye have need / before ye
ask of him. After this manner therefore shall ye pray. Our father which art
etc Matthew vi. b.

Likewise the spirit also helps our weakness. For we know not what we should
desire as we ought: nevertheles the spirit it self makes intercession mightlye
for us with vnoutspekeable groninges. How be it he that sercheth the heart
knows what the mind of the spyryt is: for he makes intercession for the
saints / according to the pleasure of God. Romanorum.viij. d.

Believe me the time comes that ye shall neither upon this montein nor at
Jerusalem worship the father. The time comes and is now already / that the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spiryt and in truth. For the
father will have such to worship him. God is a spiryt / and they that worship
him / must worship in spirit and truth. John.iiij. c.

For we are the circumcysyon / even we yt serve God in the spirit. Phil.iij.

a father / where is my honor? if I be the lord where am I feared? Malach.i. b.

Is there any man among you which if his son asked him bread / would offer him
a stone? Or if he asked fysh / would he proffer him a serpent? If ye then with are
evell / can give your children good gifts: how much more shall your father
which is in heaven / give good things to them that ask him? Mat.vij. a.

children of God.i. John.iij. a.

For so much then as ye are childeren / God has sent the spirit of his son
into your hearts / which cries: Abba (that is) father. Wherefore now thou art
not a servant / but a son. If thou be a son then art thou the heir of
God / through Christ. Gal.iiij. a Roma.viij. b.

For whosoever are led by the spirit of God / are Gods Children: for ye have
not received the spyryte of / bondage to fear any more / but ye have received
the spyryte of adopcion / whereby we cry Abba (yt is to say) father. The same
spirit certifieth our spirit yt we are the children of God. If we be children
/ then are we heirs also / namely the heirs of God / and heirs annexed with

But solomon buylt him an house / howbeit the highest of all dwells not in
temples that are made with hands / as the Prophet says. etc. Act.vij. f.

God which made the world / and all yt therein is / for so much as he is lord
of heaven and earth / dwells not in Temples made of hands / neither is he
worshipped with men's hands / as though he had need of any man / seeing he him
self gives life and breath unto al men every where: and has made of one

into ye barnes: and yet your heavenly father fedeth them. Are ye not much
better the^ they? Which of you (though he took thought therefore) could put one

the Feld how they grow. They labor not / neither Spinne. And yet for all
that I say unto you / that even Solomon in all his royalty was not arrayed
like unto one of these. Wherefore if GOD so Cloth the Grass / which is to Day
in the Field / and to morrow shall be cast into ye furnace / shall he not much
more do the same unto you / o ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought /
sayi^g: what shall we eat / or what shall we drink? or wherwt shall we be
