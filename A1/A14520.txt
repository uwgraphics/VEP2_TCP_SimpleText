By his Majesty's Council for VIRGINIA.
WHereas upon the return of Sir Thomas Dale Knight, (Marshall of VIRGINIA) the
Treasurer, Council, and Company of the same, have been thoroughly informed and
assured of the good estate of that Colony, and how by the blessing of God and
good government, there is great plenty and increase of Corn, Cattle, Goats,
Swine, and such other provisions, necessary for the life and sustenance of man;
And that there wants nothing for the settling of that Christian Plantation, but
more hands to gather and return those commodities which may bring profit to
the Adventurers, and encouragement to others: And whereas thereupon the Company
has given a Commission to Captain Samuel Argol to be the present Governor of
that Colonie, who has undertaken to transport and carry thither a certain
number of men, upon his own charge, and the charge of other his friends that
join with him in that Voyage; in which, diverse men of good quality have
resolved to adventure, and to go thither themselves in person, and to carry
with them their Wives, their Children and their Families, whereby in short time
(by the favor and assistance of Almighty God) that good work may be brought
to good perfection, by the division and setting out of lands to every
particular person, the settling of trade, and return of Commodities to the
contentment and satisfaction of all well affected Subjects, which either love
the advancement of Religion, or the honor and welfare of this Kingdom: We
his Majesty's Treasurer, Council, and Company for the same Plantation, have
thought good to declare and make known to all men by these presents, that we
have resolved to give free leave and license to any who are now remaining in
VIRGINIA, at his will and pleasure to return home into England, which liberty
we do likewise grant and confirm unto all those which hereafter from time to
time shall go thither in person, without any other restraint, then to ask
leave of the Governor (for the time being) to depart. And therefore if any man
be disposed to send any supply to his friends there, or to send for any of his
friends from thence, he may hereby take notice, that he has full power and
means to do either of them at his good descretion.

God save the King.
