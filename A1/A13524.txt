The meaning of the Emblem.
THe Devil, the Flesh, the World does Man oppos^
And are his mighty and his mortal foes:
The Devil and the whorish Flesh draws still,
The World on Wheels runs after with good will
For that which we the World may justly call
(I mean the lower Globe Terrestrial)
Is (as the Devil, and a Whore does please)
Drawn here and there, and every where, with ease
Those that their Lives to virtue here do frame,
Are in the World, but yet not of the same.
Some such there are, whom neither Flesh or Devil
Can wilfully draw on to any evil:
But for the World, as it is the World, you see
It Runs on Wheels, and who the Palfreys be*
Which Emblem, to the Reader does display
The Devil and the Flesh runs swift away.
The Chayn'd ensnared World does follow fast*
Till All into Perditions pit be cast.
The Picture topsie-turuie stands kew waw:
The World turned vpside down, as all men kn^^
The World runs on Wheels: Or Odds, betwixt Carts and Coaches.



LONDON Printed by E. A. for Henry Gosson. 1623.

To the noble Company of Cordwainers, the worshipful Company of Sadlers and
Woodmongers; To the worthy, honest and lawdable Company of Watermen, And to
the Sacred Society of Hackney-men, And finally, to as many as are grieved, and
unjustly impouerished, and molested, with The Worlds Running on Wheels.
GEntlemen and Yeomen, marvel not that I writ this Pamphlet in Prose now,
having before times set forth so many Books in verse; The First Reason that
moved me to write thus, was because I was Lame, and durst not write Verses for
fear they should be infected with my Grief, and be lame too. The Second
Reason is, because that I find no good rhyme for a Coach but Broach, Roach
Encroach, or such like: And you know that the Coach has ouer-throwne the good
use of the Broach and Broch-turner, turning the one to Rackes and the other to
Iackes, quite through the Kingdom: The Roach is a dry Fish, much like the
unprofitable profit of a Coach: It will cost more the dressing and Appurtnances
then it is worth: For the word Encroach I think that best befits it, for I
think never such an impudent, proud saucy Intruder or Encroacher came into the
world as a Coach is: for it has driven many honest Families out of their
Houses, many Knights to Beggars, Corporations to poverty, Alms deeds to all
misdeedes, Hospitality to extortion, Plenty to famine, Humility to pride,
Compassion to oppression, and all Earthly goodness almost to an utter confusion.

These have been the causes why I writ this Book in Prose, and Dedicated it
to all your good Companies, knowing that you have borne a heavy share in the
Calamity which these hired Hackney hell-Carts have put this Commonwealth
unto: For in all my whole Discourse, I do not enueigh against any Coaches that
belong to Persons of worth or quality, but only against the Catterpiller
swarm of hyrelings; they have undone my poor Trade, whereof I am a Member,
and though I look for no reformation, yet I expect the benefit of an old
Proverb ( Give the loosers leave to speak:) I have Imbroadered it with mirth,
Quilted it with material stuff, Laced it with similitudes; Sowed it with
comparisons, and in a word, so played the Tailor with it, that I think it will
fit the wearing of any honest man's Reading, Attention, and Liking: But
howsoever, I leave both it and my self to remain

Yours as you are mine: John Tailor.

The World runs on Wheels.
WHat a Murraine, what piece of work have we here? The WORLD runs a Wheels? On
my Conscience my Dung-cart will be most vnsauourly offended with it: Ihaue
heard the words often* The World runs on Wheels; what, like Pompeies Bridge
at Ostend? The great Gridyron in Christ-church, The Landskips of China, or the
new found Instrument that goes by winding up like a Jack, that a Gentleman
entreated a Musician to Roast him Sele^^ers Round upon it? Ha! how can you make
this good Master Poet? I have heard that the World stands stock still, and
never stirs, but at an Earthquake; and then it trembles at the wickedness of
the Inhabitants, and like an old Mother, groans under the misery of her
ungracious Children: well, I will buy this volume of nuention for my Boys to
read at home in an Evening when they come from School, there may be some
goodness in it; I promise you truly I have found in some of these Books very
shrewd Items; yea, and by your leave, somewhat is found in them now and then,
which the wisest of us all may be the better for: though you call them
Pamphlets, to tell you true, I like em better that are plain and merrily
written to a good intent, then those who are purposely stuffed and studied, to
deceive the world, and undo a Country, That tells us of Proiects beyond the
Moon, of Golden Mines, of Devices to make the Thames run on the North side of
London (which may very easily be done, by removing London to the Banke-side) of
planting the I Will of Dogs with Whiblins, Corwhichets, Mushromes and Tobacco. Tut
I like none of these, Let me see, as I take it, it is an inuectiue against
Coaches, or a proof or trial of the Antiquity of Carts and Coaches, It Is so,
and Gods blessing light on his heart that wrote it, for I think never since
Phaeton brake his neck, never Land has endured more trouble and molestation
then this has, by the continual rumbling of these vpstart 4. wheeled
Tortoyses, as you may perhaps find anon: For as concerning the Antiquity of
the Cart, I think it beyond the limmits of Record or writing, Besides, it has
a Reference or allusion to the Motion of the Heavens, which turns upon the
Equinoctial Axeltree, the two wheels being the Articke and Antarticke Poles.
Moreover, though it be Poetically feygned, that the Sun (whom I could have
called Phoebus, Tytan, Apollo, Soll, or Hiperion) is drawn by his four hot
and headstrong Horses (whose names as I take it are) Aeolus, Aethon, Phlegon,
and Pyrois, Yet do I not find that Triumphant, Refulgent extinguisher of
darkness is Coach'd, but that he is continually Carted through the twelve signs
of the Zodiaque.

And if Copernicus his opinion were to be allowed, that the Firmament with the
Orbs and Planets did stand immovable, and that only the Terrestrial Globe
turns round daily according to the motion of Time, yet could the World have no
resemblance of a foure-wheel'd Coach; but in all reason it must whirle round
upon but One Axeltree, like a two wheeld Cart.

Nor can the searching eye, or most admirable Art of Astronomy, ever yet
find, that a Coach could attain to that high exaltation of honor, as to be
placed in the Firmament: It is apparently seen, that Charles his Cart (which
we by custom call Charles his Waine) is most gloriously stellifide, where in
the large Circumserence of Heaven, it is a most useful and beneficial
Sea-marke (and sometimes a Landmarke too) guiding and directing in the right
way, such as travail on Neptunes waylesse Bosom, and many which are often
benighted in wild and desert passages, as my self can witness upon Newmarket
heath, where if that good Waine had not Carted me to my Lodging, I and my Horse
might have wandered I know not whither.

Moreover, as Man is the most noblest of all Creatures, and all foure-footed
Beasts are ordained for his use and service; so a Cart is the Emblem of a Man,
and a Coach is the Figure of a Beast; For as Man has two legs, a Cart has
two wheels: The Coach being (in the like sense) the true resemblance of a
Beast, by which is Parabollically demonstrated unto us, that as much as Men are
superior to Beasts, so much are honest and needful Carts more nobly to be
regarded and esteemed, above needless, vpstart, fantastical, and
Time-troubling Coaches.

And as necessities and things whose commodious uses cannot be wanted, are to
be respected before Toys and trifles (whose beginning is Folly, continuance
Pride, and whose end is Ruin) I say as necessity is to be preferred before
superfluity, so is the Cart before the Coach* For Stones, Timber, Corn, Wine,
Beer, or any thing that wants life, there is a necessity they should be
carried, because they are dead things and cannot go on foot, which necessity
the honest Cart does supply: But the Coach like a superfluous Babble, or an
uncharitable Mizer, does sildome or never carry or help any dead or helpless
thing; but on the contrary it helps those that can help themselves (like
Scoggin when he greazd the fat Sow on the Butt-end) and carries men and women,
who are able to go or run; Ergo the Cart is necessary, and the Coach
superfluous.

Besides, I am verily persuaded, that the proudest Coxcombe that ever was
iolted in a Coach, will not be so impudent but will confess that humility is
to be preferred before pride; which being granted, note the affability and
lowlines of the Cart, and the pride and insoleney of the Coach, For the Carman
humbly paces it on foot, as his Beast does, whilst the Coachma^ is mounted (his
fellow-horses and himself being all in a livery) with as many varieties of
Laces, facings, Cloth and Colors as are in the Rainebowe, like a Motion or
Pageant rides in state, and loades the poor Beast, which the Carman does not;
and if the Carmens horse be melancholy or dull with hard and heavy labor,
then will he like a kind Piper whistle him a fit of mirth, to any tune from
above Eela to below Gammoth, of which generosity and courtesy your Coachman
is altogether ignorant, for he never whistles, but all his music is to rap
out an oath, or blurt out a curse against his Teame.

The word Carmen (as I find it in the Dictionarie) does signify a Verse, or a
Song, and betwixt Carmen and Carmen, there is some good correspondencie, for
Versing, Singing, and Whistling, are all three Musical, besides the Carthorse
is a more learned beast then the Coachhorse, for scarce any Coachhorse in the
world does know any letter in the Book, when as every Carthorse does know the
letter G. very understandingly.

If Adultery or Fornication be committed in a Coach, it may be gravely and
discreetely punished in a Cart, for as by this means the Coach may be a
running Bawdy House of abomination, so the Cart may, (and often is) the sober,
modest, and civil paced Instrument of Reformation: so as the Coach may be
vices infection, the Cart often is vices correction.

It was a time of famous memorable misery, when the Danes had tyrannical
insulting domination in this lard: for the flauery of the English was so
insupportable, that he must Plowe, Sow, Reap, Thrash Winnow, Grind, Sift,
Leaven, Knead, and Bake, and the domineering Dane would do nothing but sleep,
play, and eat the fruit of the English man's labor; which well may be alluded
to the careful Cart* for let it plough, carry and recarrie, early or late,
all times and weathers, yet the hungry Coach gnawes him to the very bones: Oh
beware of a Coach as you would do of a Tiger, a Woolfe, or a Leuiathan, I Will
assure you it eats more (though it drinks less) then the Coachman and his
whole Teeme, it has a mouth gaping on each side like a monster, with which
they have swallowed all the good housekeeping in England: It lately (like a
most insatiable devouring beast) did eat up a Knight, a neighbor of mine, in
the County of N. a Wood of above 400. Akers, as if it had been but a bunch of
Radish: of another, it devoured a whole Castle, as it had been a Marchpane;
scarcely allowing the Knight and his Lady half a cold shoulder of Mutton to
their suppers on a Thursday night; out of which reuersion the Coachman and the
Footeman could pick but hungry Vailes: in another place (passing through a
Park) it could not be content to eat up all the Dear, and other grazing
Cattle, but it bit up all the Oaks that stood bareheaded, there to do
homage to their Lord and Master ever since the conquest, crushing their old
sides as easily as one of our fine Dames (with a poisoned breath) will snap a
Cinnamon stick; or with as much facility as a Bawd will eat a Pippin Tart, or
swallow a stewed Pruine.

For (what call you the Town) where the great Oysters come from? there it has
eaten up a Church, Chauncell, Steeple, Bells and all, and it threatens a great
Common that lies near, which in diebus illis has relieved thousands of poor
people; nay, so hungry it is, that it will scarcely endure, in a Gentleman's
house, a poor neighbors child so much as to turn a Spit; nor a Yeomans
son to enter the house, though but in good will to the Chambermaide, who
anciently from 16. to 36. was wont to have his breeding either in the Buttry,
Celler, Stable, or Larder, and to bid good man Hobs, good-wife Grub, or the
youth of the parish welcome at a Christmasse time; but those days are gone,
and their fellows are never like to be seen about any of our
top-gallant-houses. There was a Knight (an acquaintance of mine (whose whole
means in the world was but threescore pounds a year, and above 20. of the
same went for his Wives Coach-hire; now (perhaps) you shall have an Irish
Footman with a Iacket cudgelled down the shoulders and skirts, with yellow or
Orange tawny Lace, may trot from London 3. or 4. score miles to one of those
decayed Mansions, when the simpring scornful Pusse, the supposed Mistress of
the house (with a mischief) who is (indeed) a kind of creature retired for a
while into the Country to escape the whip in the City) she demands out of
the window scarce ready, and dressing her self in a glass at noone: Fellow
what is thine Errand, have thou letters to me? and if it be about di^ner, a man
may sooner blow up the Gates of Bergen ap Zome, with a Charm then get
entrance, within the bounds of their Barred, Bolted, and Barracadoed Wicket:
About 2. a Clock, it may be after walking an hour or twain, Sir Sellall
comes down, untrust with a Pipe of Tobacco in his fist to know your business,
having first peeped through a broken pane of Glass, to see whether you come to
demand any money, or old debt, or not, when after a few hollow dry
complements (without drink) he turns you out at the gate, his worship
returning to his Stove: What Towns are laid waste? what fields lie untilled?
what goodly houses are turned to the habitations of Howlets, Dawes, and
Hobgoblins? what numbers of poor are increased? yea examine this last year
but the Register books of burials, of our greatest Towns and Parishes of the
land, as Winondham in Norfolk, White Chapel near London, and many other,
and see how many have been buried weekly, that have merely perished for want
of bread; whilst Pride and Luxury dam up our streets, Barracado our high
ways, and are ready even to drive over their Graves, whom their unmerciful
Pride has farnished.

Whence comes Leather to be so dear, but by reason (or as I should say against
reason) of the multitude of Coaches, and Carroaches, who consume and take up
the best Hides that can be gotten in our Kingdom, insomuch that I cannot buy a
pair of Boores for my self under an Angel, nor my Wife a pair of Shoes
(though her foot be under the seauenteenes) under eight groates or three
shillings; by which means many honest Shoomakers are either undone or undoing,
and infinite numbers of poor Christians, are enforced to go barefooted in the
cold Winters, till with very benummednesse, some their toes, and some their
feet are rotted off, to the numberless increase of crooched Cripples, and
wooden legged beggars, of which sort of miserable dismembered wretches, every
street is plentifully stored with, to the scorn of other Nations, and the
shame and obloquy of our own.

The Saddlers (being an ancient, a worthy and a useful Company) they have
almost overthrown the whole trade, to the undoing of many honest Families; For
whereas within our memories, our Nobility and Gentry would tide well mounted
(and sometimes walk on foot) gallantly attended with three or four score
brave fellows in blew coats, which was a glory to our Nation; and gave more
content to the beholders, then forty of your Leather Tumbrels: Then men
preserved their bodies strong and able by walking, riding, and other manly
exercises: then Sadlers were a good Trade, and the name of a Coach was
Heathen-Greeke. Who ever saw (but upon extraordinary occasions) Sir Philip
Sidney, Sir Francis Drake, Sir John Norris, Sir William Winter, Sir Roger
Williams, or (whom I should have named first) the famous Lord Gray, and
Willoughby, with the renowned George Earl of Cumberland, or Robert Eatle of
Essex: These sons of Mars, who in their times were the glorious Brooches of
our Nation, and an admirable terror to our Enemies: these I say did make small
use of Coaches, and there were two maine reasons for it, the one was that there
were but few Coaches in most of their times: and the second reason is, they
were deadly foes to all sloth and effeminacie: The like was Sir Francis Vere,
with thousands others: but what should I talk further? this is the rattling,
rolling, rumbling age, and The World runs on Wheels. The Hackney-men who
were wont to have furnished Travelers in all places, with fitting and
serviceable Horses for any journey, (by the multitude of Coaches) are undone by
the dozens, and the whole Commonwealth most abhominably Iaded, that in many
places a man had as good to ride upon a wodden Post, as to Post it upon one of
those poor hunger-staru'd hirelings: which enormity can be imputed to nothing,
but the Coaches intrusion, is the Hackneymans confusion.

Nor have we poor Watermen the least cause to complain against this infernal
swarm of Tradespillers, who like the Grasshoppers or Caterpillars of Egypt have
so overrun the land, that we can get no living upon the water; for I dare
truly affirm that every day in any Term (especially if the Court be at
Whitehall) they do rob us of our livings, and carry 560. fares daily from us,
which numbers of passengers were wont to supply our necessities, and enable us
sufficiently with means to do our Prince and Country service: and all the
whole fry of our famous Whores, whose ancient Lodgings were near S.
Katherines, the Bankside, Lambeth-Marsh, Westminster, White Friars, Coleharbar,
or any other place near the Thames, who were wont after they had any good
Trading, or reasonable commings in, to take a Boat and air themselves upon
the water, yea (and by your leave) be very liberal to, and I say as a Mercer
said once, A Whores money is as good as a Ladies, and a Bawdes as current as a
Midwiues: Tush those times are past, and our Hackney Coaches have hurried all
our Hackney customers quite out of our reach toward the North parts of the
City, where they are daily practiced in the Coach, that by often iolting they
may the better endure the Cart upon any occasion, and indeed many times a
hired Coachman with a basket hilted blade hanged or executed about his
shoulders in a belt, (with a cloak of some py^e color, with two or three
change of Laces about) may man, a brace or a Leash of these curu^tting
Cockatrices to their places of recreation, and so save them the charge of
maintaining a Sir Pandarus or an Apple-squire, which service indeed to speak
the truth, a Waterman is altogether unfit for; and the worst is, most of them
are such Loggerheads, that they either will not learn, but as I think would
scorn to be taught: so that if the Sculler had not been paid when he was
paid, it is to be doubted that he should never have been paid, for the
Coachman has gotten all the custom from the Scullers pay-Mistris.

This is one apparent reason, why all the Whores have forsaken us, and spend
their Cash so free and frequent upon those ingenious, well practiced, and
serviceable hired Coachmen: but (a Pox take em all) whither does my wits run
after Whores and Knaves? I pray you but note the streets, and the chambers or
lodgings in Fleet street, or the Strand, how they are pesterd with them,
especially after a Masque or a Play at the Court, where even the very earth
quakes and trembles, the Cazements shatter, tatter and clatter, and such a
confused noise is made, as if all the devils in hell were at Barly-breake; so
that a man can neither sleep, speak, hear, write, or eat his dinner or
supper quiet for them: besides, their tumbling din (like a counterfeit Thunder)
does sour Wine, Ale and Beer most abhominably, to the impairing of their
healths that drink it, and the making of many a Victualer and Tapster
Trade-falne.

A Wheelewright or a maker of Carts, is an ancient, a profitable, and a Trade,
which by no means can be wanted; yet so poor it is, that scarce the best
amongst them can hardly ever attain to better then a Calueskin suit, or a
piece of neck Beef and Carretrootes to dinner on a Sunday; nor scarcely any of
them is ever mounted to any Office above the degree of a Scauenger, or a
Tything man at the most. On the contrary, your Coachmakers trade is the most
gainefullest about the Town, they are apparelled in Sattens and Veluets, are
Master of their Parish, Vestry men, who fare like the Emperors Heliogabalus,
or Sardanapalus, seldom without their Mackeroones, Parmisants, Iellyes and
Kickshawes, with baked Swannes, Pasties hot, or c^ld red Dear Pyes, which
they have from their Debtors worships in the Country: neither are these
Coaches only thus cumbersome by their Rumbling and Rutting, as they are by
their standing still, and damming up the streets and lanes, as the Black
Friars, and diverse other places can witness, and against Coachmakers doors the
streets are so pesterd and clogged with them, that neither Man, Horse, or Cart
can pass for them; in so much as my Lord Mayor is highly to be commended for
his care in this restraint, sending in February last many of them to the
Counter for their carelessness herein.

They have been the universal decay of almost all the best Ash Trees in the
Kingdom, for a young plant can no soouer peep up to any perfection, but
presently it is felled for the Coach: Nor a young Horse bred of any beauty or
goodness, but he is ordained from his foaling for the service of the Coach; so
that whereas in former ages, both in peace and wars, we might compare with
any Nation in the world for the multitude and goodness of our Horses: we now
think of no other employment for them, then to draw in a Coach, and when they
are either lamed by the negligence of the Coachman, or worn out after many
years with trotting to Plays and Bawdy houses, then are they (like old
maimed Soldiers) after their wounds and scarres, preferred to Woodmongers,
(where they are well Billited) or to Draymen, where they turn Tapsters, and
draw Beer by whole Barrels, and Hogsheads at once; and there they wear out
the Remainder of their days, till new harnei^ for others, are made of their
old skins.

The last Proclamations concerning the Retiring of the Gentry our of the City
into their Countries, although my self, with many thousands more were much
impouerished and hindered of our Livings by their departure; yet on the other
side how it cleared the Streets of these way-stopping Whirligiggs, for a man
now might walk without being stand up hoe, by a fellow that scarcely can
either go or stand himself. Prince, Nobility, and Gentlemen of worth,
Offices and Quality, have herein their privilege, and are exempt, may ride as
their occasions or pleasures shall indite them, as most meet they should; but
when every Gill Turntripe, Mrs. Fumkins, Madame Polecat, and my Lady Trash,
Froth the Tapster, Bill the Tailor, Lauender the Broker, Whiff the Tobacco
seller, with their companion Trugs, must be Coach'd to S. Albones, Burntwood,
Hockley in the Hole, Croydon, Windsor, Vxbridge, and many other places, like
wild Haggards prancing up and down, that what they get by cheating, swearing,
and lying at home, they spend in Riot, Whoring, and Drunkenness abroad. I say
by my hallidome, it is a burning shame; I did lately write a Pamphlet called a
Thief, wherein I did a little touch upon this point; that seeing the Heard of
Hireling Coaches are more then the Whirries on the Thames, and that they make
Leather so excessive decre, that it were good the order in Bohemia were
observed here, which is, that every hired Coach should be drawn with Ropes,
and that all their Harness should be Hemp and Cordage: besides if the Cover
and Boots of them were of good Rosind or pitched Canuas, it would bring down
the price of Leather, and by that means a hired Coach would be known from a
Princes, a Noble man's, Ladies, or people of note, account, respect and quality.

And if it be but considered in the right Kue, a Coach or Carroach are mere
Engines of Pride, (which no man can deny to be one of the seven deadly
sins) for two Leash of Oyster-wiues hired a Coach on a Thursday after
Whitsontide, to carry them to the greene-Goose Fair at Stratford the Bow, and
as they were hurried betwixt Algate and Mile-end, they were so be-Madam'd,
be-Mistrist, and Ladifide by the Beggars, that the foolish women began to swell
with a proud supposition or Imaginary greatness, and gave all their money to
the mendicanting Canters; insomuch that they were feign to pawn their Gowns
and Smocks the next day to buy Oysters, or else their pride had made them Cry
for want of what to Cry withal.

Thus much I can speak by experience; I do partly know some of mine own
qualities, and I do know that I do hate pride, as I hate famine or
surfeiting; and moreover, I know my self to be (at the best) but John Tailor,
and a mechanical Waterman, yet it was but my chance once to be brought from
Whitehall to the Tower in my Master Sir William Waades Coach, and before I had
been drawn twenty yards, such a Timpany of pride puffed me up, that I was
ready to burst with the wind Chollick of vain glory. In what state I would
lean over the Boot, and look, and pry if I saw any of my acquaintance, and
then I would stand up, vayling my Bonnet, kissing my right clawe, extending my
arms as I had been swimming, with God save your Lordship, Worship, or how
do thou honest neighbor or good fellow? in a word, the Coach made me think
my self better then my betters that went on foot, and that I was but little
inferior to Tamberlaine, being iolted thus in state by those pampered Iades of
Belgia: all men of indifferent judgment will confess, that a Cart is an
instrument conformable to law, order, and discipline; for it rests on the
Sabbath days, and commonly all other Holy days, and if it should by any
means break or transgress against any of these good Injunctions, there are
Informers that lie in ambush (like careful Scowtes) to inform against the
poor Cart, that in conclusion my Lady Pecunia must become surety and take up
the matter, or else there will be more stir about the flesh then the Broth
is worth: whereas (on the contrary) a Coach like a Pagan, an Heathen, an
Infidel, or Atheist, observes neither Sabbath, or holiday, time or season,
^obustiously breaking through the toil or net of divine and humane law, order,
and authority, and as it were contemning all Christian conformity; like a dog
that lies on a heap of Hay, who will eat none of it himself, nor suffer any
other beast to eat any: even so the Coach is not capable of hearing what a
Preacher says, nor will it suffer men or women to hear that would hear, for
it makes such a hideous rumbling in the Streets by many Church doors, that
peoples ears are stopped with the noise, whereby they are debard of their
edifying, which makes faith so fruitless, good works so barren, and charity
as cold at Midsommer, as if it were a great Frost, and by this means souls
are robbed and starued of their heeuenly Manna, and the Kingdom of darkness
replenished: to avoid which, they have set up a cross post in Cheapside on
Sundays near Woodstreet end, which makes the Coaches rattle and iumble on the
other side of the way further from the Church, and from hindering of their
hearing.

The Nagaians, Iughonians, and the ungodly barbarous Tartarians, who knew no
God or devil, Heaven nor hell, and who indeed are Nations that have neither
Towns, Cities, Villages, or houses; Their habitations are nothing but
Coaches: in their Coaches they eat, sleep, beget children, who are also there
borne, and borne from place to place, with them the World runs on Wheels
continually, for they are drawn in Droues or Herds 20. 30. or 40000.
together, to any fruitful place or Champion plain, where they and their
beasts do stay till they have devoured all manner of sustenance that may
maintain life, and then they remove to a fresh place doing the like; thus
wearing out their accursed lives like the brood of Caine, they and their
houses being perpetual vagabonds, and continual runnagates upon the face of
the earth. They are so practiced and inured in all kind of Barbarism, that
they will milk one Mare and let another blood, and the blood and the milk
they will Charne together in their Hats or Caps, till they have made fresh
Cheese and Cream (which the devil will scarce eat) from these people our
Coaches had first original, and I do wish with all my heart that the
superfluous number of all our hireling Hackney carrie-Knaues and Hurrie-Whores,
with their makers and maintainers were there, where they might never want
continual employment.

For their Antiquity in England, I think it is in the memory of many men when
in the whole Kingdom, there was not one, and there was another principal
virtue, as good as themselves came with them: for the Proverb says, That
mischief or mischances seldom come alone: and it is a doubtful question,
whether the devil brought Tobacco into England in a Coach, or else brought a
Coach in a fogge or mist of Tobacco.

For in the year 1564. one William B^ouen a Dutchman brought first the use of
Coaches hither, and the said Boonen was Queen Elizabeth's Coachman, for indeed
a Coach was a strange Monster in those days, and the fight of them put both
horse and man into amazement: some said it was a great Crab-shell brought out
of China, and some imagined it to be one of the Pagan Temples, in which the
Canibals adored the devil: but at last all those doubts were cleared, and
Coach-making became a substantial Trade: So that now all the world may see,
they are as common as Whores, and may be hired as easy as Knights of the Post.

The Cart is an open transparent Engine, that any man may perceive the plain
honesty of it; there is no part of it within or without, but it is in the
continual view of all men: On the contrary, the Coach is a close hipocrite,
for it has a cover for any Knavery, and Curtains to veil or shadow any
wickedness: besides, like a perpetual Cheater, it wears two Boots and no
Spurs, sometimes having two pair of legs in one Boot, and often times
(against nature) most preposterously it makes fair Ladies wear the Boot; and
if you note, they are carried back to back, like people surpised by Pirates,
to be tied in that miserable manner, and thrown over board into the Sea.
Moreover, it makes people imitate Sea Crabs, in being drawn side-wayes, as
they are when they sit in the boot of the Coach, and it is a dangerous kind
of Carriage for the Commonwealth, if it be rightly considered; for when a man
shall be a Justice of the Peace, a Serieant, or a Counselor at Law; what hope
is it that all or many of them should use upright dealing, that have been so
often in their youth, and daily in their maturer or riper age, drawn aside
continually in a Coach, some to the right hand, and some to the left, for use
makes perfectness, and often going aside willingly makes men forget to go
upright naturally.

The order of Knighthood is both of great Antiquity and very honorable, yet
within these later times there is a strange mystery crept into in, for I have
noted it that when a Gentleman has the sword laid upon his shoulder, either by
his Prince, or his Deputy or General in the field, although the blow with the
sword, be an honor to the man, yet (by a kind of inspiration) it cripples his
wife, though she be at that time 300. miles from her husband, for if you but
note her, you shall see her lamed for ever, so that she can by no means go
without leading under the arm, or else she must be carried in a Coach all her
life time after; forgetting in a manner to go on her feet so much as to
Church, though it be but two Quoytes cast; for I have heard of a Gentlewoman
that was lamed in this manner, who sent her man to Smithfield from
Charing-Crosse, to hire a Coach to carry her to Whitehall; another did the
like from Ludgate hill, to be carried to see a Play at the Black Friars: And
in former times when they used to walk on foot, and recreate themselves, they
were both strong and healthful; now all their exercise is privately to Saw
Billets, to hang in a Swinge, or to roll the great Rowler in the Alleyes of
their Garden, but to go without leading, or Riding in a Coach is such an
impeachment and derogation to their Calling, which flesh and blood can by no
means endure.

Every man knows, that were it not for the Cart the Hay would Rot in the
meadows, the Corn perish in the fields, the Markets be emptily furnished, at
the Courts remove the King would be vnseru'd, and many a Gallant would be
enforced to be his own Sumpter-horse to carry his luggage, bag and baggage
himself; and finally, were it not for the mannerly and courteous service of
the Cart, many a well deserving ill conditioned brave fellow might go on foot
to the gallows.

A Cart (by the judgment of an honorable and grave Lawyer) is elder brother
to a Coach for antiquity; and for vtility and profit, all the world knows which
is which, yet so unnatural and unmannerly a brother the Coach is, that it will
give no way to the Cart, but with pride, contempt bitter curses and
execrations, the Coachman wishes all the Carts on fire, or at the devil, and
that Carmen were all hanged, when they cannot pass at their pleasures, quite
forgetting themselves to be saucy unprofitable intruders, up starts, and
Innouators.

When I see a Coach put up into a house (me thinks) the pole standing
stiffely erected, it looks like the Image of Priapus, whom the libidinous and
leacherous Whores and Knaves of Egypt were wont to fall down and worship; and
I pray you what hinderance has it but it may use the Paphean or Priapean game?
for it is never unfurnished of a bed and curtains, with shop windows of
leather to buckle Bawdry up as close in the midst of the street, as it were in
the Stews, or a Nunnery of Venus Votaries.

What excessive waste do they make of our best broad-cloath of all colors?
and many times a young heir will put his old Fathers old Coach in a mourning
Gown of Cloth or Cotton, when many of the poor distressed members of Christ,
goes naked, staruing with cold, not having any thing to hide their wretched
carcasses; and what spoil of our Veluets, Damaskes, Taffataes, Silver and Gold
Lace, with Fringes of all sorts, and how much consumed in guilding, wherein is
spent no small quantity of our best and finest gold: nor is the charge little
of maintaining a Coach in reparation, for the very mending of the Harness, a
Knights Coachman brought in a bill to his Master of 25. pounds: besides there
is used more care and diligence in matching the Horses and Mares, then many
fathers and mothers do in the marriage of their sons and daughters: for many
times a rich lubberly Clown, the son of some gowty extortioner, or
rent-racking Rascal, (for his accursed muckes sake) may be matched with a
beatifull or propper well qualified and nobly descended Gentlewoman, and a well
faced handsome Esquire or Knights son and heir may be joined with a Ioyners
puppet, or the daughter of a Sexton; but for the choice of your Coach-horses
there is another manner of providence to be used, for they must be al of a
color, longitude, latitude, Cressitude, height, length, thickness, breadth,
(I muse they do not weigh them in a pair of Balance) and being once matched
with a great deal of care and cost, if one of them chance to die (as by
experience I know a Horse to be a mortal beast) then is the Coach like a
maimed cripple, not able to travel, till after much diligent search, a meet
mate be found whose correspondency may be as equivalent to the suruiuing
Palfrey, and in all respects as like as a Broom to a Bee^ome, Barme to Yeast,
or Quodlings to boyld Apples.

The mischiefs that have been done by them are not to be numbered, as breaking
of legs and arms, overthrowing down hills, over bridges. running over
children, lame and old people, as Henry the fourth of France, (the father to
the King that now reigns) he and his Queen were once like to have been
drowned, the Coach overthrowing besides a bridge, and to prove that a Coach
owed him an unfortunate trick, he was some few years after his first escape,
most inhumanely and traitorously murdered in one, by Rauiliacke, in the streets
at Paris: but what need I run my invention out of breath into foreign
countries for examples, when many of the chief Nobility and Gentry of our
own Nation have had some trial and sad experience of the truth of what I
write? sometimes the Coachman (it may be has bin drunk, or to speak more
mannerly stolen a Manchet out of the Brewers Basket) has tumbled besides his
Box of state, and Coach running over him has killed him, the whilst the horses
(having the reins loose) have run away with their Rattle at their heels
(like dogs that had bladders of dried Beans, or empty bottles at their
tails) as if the devil had been in them, and sometimes in the full speed of
their course a wheel breaks, or the Naue slips off from the Axletree, down
leapes the Coachman, and away runs the horses, throwing their carriage into
bushes, hedges, and ditches, never leaving their mad pace, till they have torn
to tatters their tumbling Tumbrell, to the manifest peril, danger, and
unrecoverable hurt to those whom they carry, and to all men, women, children
and cattle, as Hogs, Sheep, or whatsouer chances to be in their way:
besides the great cost and charge of mending and Reparations of the Coach.

There is almost nothing, but when it is worn out, it will serve for some use,
either for profit or pleasure (except a Coach) of the bottom of an old Cart,
one may make a fence to stop a gap, of the Raues one may make a Ladder for
Hens to go to Roost: of an old Bores Frank, a new Dogge-kennell may be
founded; of a decayed Wherry or Boat, a back part of a house of office may be
framed (as you may see every where on the Bankside) of an old Barrel, a
bolting Hutch, an ouer-worne old Whore will make a spick and span new Bawd;
and a rotten Bawd may make a new Witch. I knew a neighbor of mine (an old
Justice) that of the bald velvet lyning of his Cloak, made him a pair of new
Breeches, and those Breeches being worn past the best, with the best of them
he made his wife a new French Hoode; and when that was bare and past her
wearing, it made him facing for his new Boot tops: But an old Coach is good
for nothing but to cosen and deceive people, as of the old rotten Leather
they make Vampies for high Shoes, for honest Country Plow-men, or Belts for
Soldiers, or inner lynings for Girdles, Dogge-chollers for Mastiffes, indeed
the Box if it were bored through, would be fittest for a close stool, and the
body would (perhaps) serve for a Sow to pigge in.

If the curses of people that are wronged by them might have prevailed, sure I
think the most part of them had been at the devil many years ago. Bu^^hers
cannot pass with their cattle for them. Market folks which bring provision
of victuals to the City, are stopped, stayed, and hindered. Carts or Waynes with
their necessary ladings are debard and let: the Milke-maydes ware is often
spilt in the dirt* and peoples guts like to be crushed out being crowded and
shrouded up against stalls, and stoopes. whilst Mistres Siluerpin with her
Pander, and a pair of ^^amd Pullets ride grinning and deriding in their
H^ll-Cart at their miseries who go on foot: I my self have been so served
when I have wished them all in the great Breach, or on a light fire upon
Hownslow heath, or Salisburie plain: and their damming up the streets in this
manner, where people are wedged together that they can hardly stir, is a
maine and great advantage to the most virtuous Mystery of purse-cutring, and
for any thing I know the hired or hackney Coachman may join in confederacy and
share with the Cutpurse, one to stop up the way, and the other to shift in the
Crowd.

The superfluous use of Coaches has been the occasions of many vile and odious
crimes, as murder, theft, cheating, hangings, whippings, Pillories, ^^ockes
and cages; for housekeeping never decayed (...) Coaches came into England,
till which time those were accounted the best men who had most followers and
retainers; then land about or near London was thought dear enough at an noble
the Aker yearly, and a ten-pound house-rent now, was scarce twenty shillings
then, but the witchcraft of the Coach quickly mounted the price of all things
(except poor men's labor) and withal transformed (in some places 10. 20. 30.
40. 50. 60. or 100. proper Seruingmen, into two or three Animals (videlicet) a
Butterfly page, a trotting footman, a stiff-drinking Coachman, a Cook, a
Clarke, a Steward, and a Butler, which has enforced many a discarded tall
fellow (through want of means to live, and grace to guide him in his poverty)
to fall into such mischievous actions before named, for which I think the
Gallowses in England have deuonred as many lusty valiant men within these 30.
or 40. years, as would have been a sufficient army to beat the foes of
Christ out of Christendom, and marching to Constantinople, have plucked the
great Turk by the Beard: but as is aforesaid, this is the age wherien The
World Runs on Wheels.

It is a most uneasy kind of passage in Coaches on the paued streets in
London, wherein men and women are so tossed, tumbled, iumbled, rumbled, and
crossing of kennels, dunghills, and vneuen-wayes, which is enough to put all
the guts in their bellies out of joint, to make them have the Palsy or Megrum,
or to cast their Gorges with continual Rocking and Wallowing: to prevent
which, there was a gentleman of great note, found fault with his Coachhorses,
because his Coach iolted him, commanding his man to sell away those hard
trotting Iades, and to buy him a pair of Amblers, that might draw him with
more ease: another, when he saw one of his horses more lusty and free then his
fellow, he commanded his Coachman to feed him only with bread and water,
till he were as tame and quiet as the other, which wise command was dutifully
observed.

The best use that ever was made of Coaches was in the old wars betwixt the
Hungarians and the Turks, (for like so many land Galleys) they carried
soldiers on each side with Crosbowes, and other warlike engines, and they
served for good use being many thousands of them, to disrowte their enemies,
breaking their ranks and order, making free and open passage for their horse
and foot amongst the scattered squadrons and regiments, and upon occasion they
served as a wall to Embarricado and fortify their camp: this was a millitarie
employment for Coaches, and in this sort only I could wish all our hirelings
to be used. It is to be supposed that Pharaohs Charriots which were drowned in
the red sea, were no other things in shape and fashion then our Coaches are at
this time, and what great pity was it that the makers and memories of them had
not been obliuiously swallowed in that Egiptian downfall?

Mowntaigne, a learned and a noble French Writer, does relate in his book of
Essays, that the ancient Kings of Asia, and the Eastern parts of Europe, were
wont to be drawn in their Coaches with four Oxen, and that Mark Anthony with
a Whore with him was drawn with Lions. Heliogabalus the Empero^r was drawn
with four naked Whores, (himself being the Coachman) and the Coaches in these
late times (to show some spark of gratitude or thankfulness) in remembrance
that naked Whores once drew (...) of them, they do in requital very often
carry Whores half naked to the belly, and gallantly apparelled; besides only
but four Whores drew one Coach, and 500. Coaches has carried 10000. of them
for it: but sometimes they were drawn with Stagges, as it is the use in
Lapland at this day. The Emperor Firmus was drawn with four Estridges, and
to requite those favors, they do now often carry men as ravenous as Lions,
as well headed as Oxen or Stagges, and as the Estridges did once draw, so the
feathers of them do daily ride in Plumes and Fannes.

In the City of Antwerp in Brabant I have seen little Coaches, which men send
their children to School in, each of them drawn by a Mastiffe dog, not
having any guide: for the dog himself does exercise three offices at one
time, being as the Horse to draw, the Coachman to direct, and an honest
laboring dog besides.

I remember that in one place aforesaid, I have written, that Coaches do
seldom carry any dead things, as Stones, Timber, Wine, Beer, Corn, etc.
But* in so writing I find that I have done many of them great wrong, for I
perceive that they carry oftentimes diverse sorts of Rye, as Knaue-Rye,
Foole-Rye, Leache-Rye, Rogue-Rye, Vsue-Rye, Bawde-Rye, Braue-Rye, Slaue-Rye,
and Begge-Rye. Sometimes (by chance) they may hap to carry good Husband-Rye,
and Housewife-Rye, but such burdens are as scarce, as money or charity: and
one thing more comes into my mind about their multitude, for though a Coach
do (...) to be a dead or senseless thing, yet when I se(...) consider how
they do multiply and increase: I am doubtful but that they are male and
female, and use the act of generation or begetting, or else their procreation
could never so have ouer-spread our Nation.

To conclude, a Coach may fitly be compared to a Whore, for a Coach is painted,
so is a Whore: a Coach is common, so is a Whore: a Coach is costly, so is a
Whore; a Coach is drawn with beasts, a Whore is drawn away with beastly
Knaves. A Coach has loose Curtains, a Whore has a loose Gown, a Coach is
laced and fringed, so is a Whore: A Coach may be turned any way, so may a
Whore: A Coach has Bosses, Studs, and gilded nails to adorn it: a Whore
has Owches, Brooches, Bracelets, Chains and Jewels to set her forth: a Coach
is always out of reparations, so is a Whore: a Coach has need of mending
still, so has a Whore: a Coach is unprofitable, so is a whore: a Coach is
superfluous, so is a Whore: a Coach is insatiate, so is a Whore: A Coach
breaks men's necks: a Whore breaks men's backs: This odds is betwixt a Coach
and a Whore, a man will lend his Coach to his friend, so will he not his
Whore: but any man's Whore will save him the labor of lending her; for she will
lend her self to whom she pleases. And thus my Book and comparisons end
together; for thus much I know, that I have but all this while barked at the
Moon, thrown feathers against the wind, built upon the (...) ^^ackmore, and
labored in vain: (...) or enormitie has pleasure in it, (...) profit, and
power to defend it, (...) speak, and weakness may babble of Reformation,
though to no end: and so I end.

FINIS.
