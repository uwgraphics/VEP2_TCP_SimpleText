Two Epystles One of Henry Bullynger, with the consent of all the lernyd men of
the Church of Tigury: another of Ihon Caluyn, cheffe Preacher of the Church of
Geneue: whether it be lawful for a Christen man to communycate or be pertaker
of the Mass of the Papystes, without offendyng God and his neighbor, or not.

i. Corint. x. They that eat of the sacryfyce, are partakers of the altar.
Wherefore dearly beloved, fle from the worshyppyng of ydolls.

The Prologe unto the Christen Reader.
HEre have thou Christen Reader the sentences and judgments of the excellent
and godly lernyd men / Henry Bullynger / with all the learned men of the church
of Tygury / and also the sentence and judgment of Ihon Caluyne of Geneua /
Whether a Christen man may lawfully co^munycate or be pertaker with the Mass
and ceremonies of the Papystes / without offendyng God and his neighbor or
not. Therefore have I set forth this epistle of those godly and lernyd men / to
the intent that thou may the better know what ydolatrye is / and wherein it
consists / whereby also thou may the better learn and know how to avoid
it: Consyderinge that it is the greatest offense that may be committed a gaynst
God. For it is forbidden in the first commandment / saying: Thou shall have
no another gods but me. Also all the holy Prophets of God ever cried out
thereupon. And again it is manifest through the hole Bible how greuouse a sin
it is / by the greuousnes of the plages with the which God ever plagyd the
children of Israel therefore. But here some will answer and say: We know that
ydolatrye is a greuouse sin / and sore dyspleaseth God: But will you say
that the holy Mass and Ceremonies that have been used in the church this many
hundryd years / and also set up by holy counsayles be wicked / and that men
commytte ydolatrye by vsyng of them? Deuteronomy. xij. Deuteronomy. iiij Deuteronomy. v
To that I answer that what so ever law or Ceremonye / the church has made
or set up / and the same not expressed in the word of God / it owght not to be
allowed / followed / nor kept: For God commanded the children of Israel /
Deuter. xij. that they should not do every man what thinks him good in his
own eyes? And again Deuter.iiij. Ye shall put no thing to the word of God /
nor take no thing therfrom. And again in the.v. chap. of the same book. Take heed therefore that you do as the Lord your God has commaundyd you: and turn
not aside / nether to the right hand nor to the lift: but walk in all the
ways which the Lord thy God commaundyd the. etc. Now where can it be found in
any word of God / the inuencyon of the Papists Masses / or that images ought
to be in churches / or soch like. Paraue^ture thou will answer me that they
were ordained and set up for a good intent and purpose. Leui. x
Thereto I answer / that Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron were consumes
with the fire / as appeteth Leui. ^ for offering strange fire before the Lord
/ that the Lord commanded the^ not. Therefore whatsoever is inuentyd by the
fantasye of man's ymaginacio^ without the word of God / we ought not to consent
to do it: Galat. i.
For s. Paul says to the Galathia^s. If we our selves or an angel of heaven
come / and preach an other gospel unto you / then that we have preached /
hold him acursyd. And although the mass a ceremonies have a glorious shine of
holiness / yet owght we not therefore, the less abhor it / seeing Christ says
Mat. xv. Matt. xv.
They worship me in vain / teaching doctrynes and tradycyo^s of men. Also
Christ says Luke xvi. Luke. xvi
That which is in high estimacyo^ before men / is abhomynable before God:
Signyfyeng thereby unto us that the most glorious works and ceremonies / that
be had in most high estimacyo^ before the world / if the same be not agreinge
to the most holy word of God / they be abhomynable and very folyshnes before
God. etc. i. Cori. ii^
And where as our mercy full saueyoure Christ ordained his holy Sacrament of
his body and blood: not to be worshypped / but to the intent that all that are
sto^ge in the conscience with sin / should come and seek help only in him /
the which is the only helper of all that call upon him / as s. Peter says:
there is no health in any other / nether is there any other name given unto men
whereby they shall be sauyd. Act. iiij.
Antichrist with his disciples have peruertyd it / clean from the use that
owre Sauyoure did instytute it / like as the children of Israel also did
pervert the use of the brazen serpent / that God commandyd Moses to make and to
hang up in the wyldernes / to the intent only / that they that were sto^ge
with the fyrye serpe^tes might be healyd only by beholdynge the serpent of
brass that Moses had hangyd up: Numr xx^
The which brazen serpent dyscrybyd lively the hangyng up of Christ upon the
cross / as apperyth John.iij. to the intent that none that believe in him
should peryshe / but have lyffe everlasting. Wherefore like as the good king
Ezechias brake down the serpent of brass / because the children of Israel did
commit ydolatrye / and worshypped it / contrary to the use that it was set up
for. John. iij.
Even so thanks and praise be unto God has other Kings and Princes in this
days in other co^tres / caused the Mass of the papystes to be abolysshed and
to be no more vsyd nor said / because that therein the people committed
ydolatrye by worshyhping the bread / like as the children of Israel committed
ydolatrye with worshipping the brazen serpent. Nether is it any other thing
then ydolatrye to believe that a vysyble ceremonye of it selffe is a service to
the inuysyble God / whose service is spiritual as he is a spryte / and
therefore wylbe worshypped in spryte and treuth. John. iiij. John. iiij.
Roma. vi
Therefore do I exhort the Christen Reader / whatsoever thou be that shall
read this epistles of these godly lernyd men / that thou will follow s. Paul's
co^sayle / where he says: As ye have given your members servants to
uncleanness and wyckednes / runnyng out of one wickedness into another: i. Corin.
x ij. Cor. vi
Even so now give your members to serve ryghtuousnes. And remember al so that
they that eat of the sacryfyce are pertakers of the altar. And consider what
a godly lesson s. Paul gives his Corinthia^s in the second epistle the.vi.
cha. saying: Bear not the yocke with the unbelievers: for what fellowship has
righteousness with unrighteousness / what company has light with darkness / what
co^corde has Christ with Belyall / either what part has he that believes with
an infydell / how agreith the temple of God with the images: For ye are the
temple of that living God / as said God: I will dwell among them / and walk
among the^ / and will be their God / and they shall be my people: wherefore come
out of the mids of them (says the Lord) and touch none unclean thing: so
will I receive you / and will be a father unto you / and ye shall be my sons and
daughters says the Lord almighty. ij. Cor. vij
i. Corin. x
For as much as we have such promyses derely beloved / let us cleanse our
selves from all filthynes of the flesh and spyryte / and grow up to full
holiness in the fear of God. Wherefore derely beloved / fle from the
worshippinge of ydoles / least by thine evil example thou confirm the weak
brother in his error / and so thy weak brother peryshe for whom Christ dyed
/ and so will God requier his blood of thy hand: i. Cor. viij
wherefore I heartily require the Christen reader / that thou will diligently
read the.iij. chap. of Daniel / and mark how Sydrack / Mysach and Abdenago /
the which were great rulers / did rather chose to be cast in the kote bre^ning
oven / then they would outwardly bow them selves to the image that the King
has set up. Dani. iij.
Matthew. v.
Therefore Christian Reader do I the exhort yet once again / that thou will put
thy thrust only in the living God / and believe steadfastly in thine heart /
that he is able and will fulfill all his good promyses / that he has promised
/ and that heaven and earth shall pass / but one tote or title of the law
shall not pass / till all be fulfilled. i. Corin. x
And he has promised / that he will not suffer his to be tempted above their
strength: but will in the mids of the temptacyon make a way to escape out.
That is / if thou put thy hole trust only in him / seking only his glory and
praise in all that thou go about / he will (I say) according to his
acustomable mercyes deliver the: either by blyndynge the eyes of thine
adversaries / that they shall take no head of the: Dani. i.
or else give the favor in the sight of them as he gave Danyel with the.iij.
young men favor in the sight of the keeper / when they were in captyuyte /
because they had determined with the^ selfs to keep the^ undefiled. Tobi. i
And also gave Tobias favor in the sight of the King Salmanaser / with many
other / as Joseph / Jeremy. and c: Or else if they espy the / he shall give
the strength to glorifye his name by suffryng for his truth / as he has done
many holy Prophets / Apostles and martyrs / whose hope and trust was only in
the resurreccyo^. And for that cause the mother with her.vij. sons did chose
to suffer cruel torments and martyrdom / rather then they would eat swynes
flesh that was forbidden in the law / not fearyng the tyrauntes that could do
no more but kill the body / beleuynge and saying that God would raise them up
again / which dye for his laws in the resurreccyo^ of everlasting life. ij.
Match. vij.
And also note the constancye of old Elcazare / the which rather then he would
but make a countynau^ce as though he would have eaten of such meats as were
forbidden in the law / did rather chose to suffer the most cruel death / as
appears in the second book of Machabees in the.vj. Chapter / the which if thou
do mark with a syngle eye / I put no dowbt but thou shall easily perceive how
greatly all manner outward symulacyon of wyckednes does displease God / and
therefore also how greatly every Christen man ought to abhor it. ij. Match.
vij.


Thus I commyt the Christen reader to the defense and keeping of the most high
God / which dwellyth not in temples made with hands / nether is woshypped with
men's inuencyons / but whose seat is the heavens / and the earth his footstool
/ as says the prophet / that with the breath of his mouth shall dystroye all
antychrystes with all there venemus laws that has coriupt and poysonyd the
precyos soul of man. Act. vij.
Esai. lxvi
ij Tes. ij.
i. Tim. vi.
For whom our merciful saueyour Christ shedd his most precyus blude / The
which only has immortalyte / and dwellyth in the light that no man can
attain / who^ never man saw nor can see / to him only be al honor glory
and praise for ever and ever world with out end. Amen.

Here folowyth the Epistle of Henry Sullengers.
IT is showed us worshipful brother Herma^ ne / by the excele^t and right
godly man master John Beckstayne / that there goes abroad a certain epistle
from one to a another among the congregacio^s of low dowchlande / wherein it is
plainly taught to be lefull for Christen men to go to high mass as they
call it. And that because of this epistle some be greatly trobled in
conscience / and other some conjecture all the mynisters of the congregacions
of high dowchland to be of the same judgment. Wherefore we of the church of
Tigurye thowght it good to purge the old and true faith and learning which we
hold / from this unhappy suspicion / openly confessing unto you (a minister by
the grace of God / in the congregacions of low Germanye / both of good
learning and conuersacyon) that we nether be our selves of that mind / nor yet
allow that sentence. As for things which be called mean and indifferent / we
believe a christen man may use them in all times and places without scrupulosyte
of conscience / so that all thing be done discreatlye / and according to
charity. That is to say / to the glory of God and the edifyeng of our
neighbors / and the hole congregation. But the popes mass / be it high or
low / images / and other like / which be expresselye against the word of God
/ and the pure faith / we recke^ not among indifferent things: an indifferent
thing is that which is nether good nor evil / for whether thou do it or do it
not / thou shall nether be ryghtwise nor vnrightwise therefore. For thus does
Iherome him self diffiue it / in a epistle to saynct Augustyne. Now what man
having his right understanding can say the high mass / and the use of images
in churches not to be evil? or who can lyghtlye grant it to be good? The law
of God does euedentlye condemn one and other / all strange worshippynge and
ceremonies / or gods service (/ that is to say) such as are not institute of
God / or such as are inuentide by man with out the word of God. But what is
the high mass / else save a ryte or ceremonye set up by man beside the word of
God? For as for Christ's supper what it is / ^ after what fassyon christ
commandyd it to be celebrate we be not ignorant. Libro. ij^ epist. iij
This is also to well known that they which keep the high mass / do conde^pne
the supper of the lord / and the manner thereof as barbarouse / rude and he
reticall / when as not withstondyng the holy marter saynct Ciprian says that
in the supper we owght nether to follow or receive any other thing / then what
the Lord him self has delivered unto us. iiij. Reg. ij. c
And again it is false and counterfayte says he / it is wicked and
dishonoryth God / what so ever is institutid by the made brain of man / if
that gods ordinance be broken therbye. iij. Regu^ xviij. v
Besides this Helias the holy Prophet of God which we believe was conuayed into
heaven in a fyrye charete did not he forbid to cuple gods and mames
ordinance to gether other to mingle the one with the other. If the Lord
(says he) be God follow him how long will you halt on both sides? Sophon. l. v
In like manner Sophonias also I will distroye says he / those persons that
swear by the Lord and by Malchom. Verelye if the only sacrifice of Christ
once offryde for the sins of the world / makes the beleuers perfect: what
need they in there high masses / daily to offer the body and blude of Christ
for the sins of the quycke and dead. John. v. Mark xvi. v
If they which depart in faith pass from death unto life? If they which dye in
unbelieve / escape not dampnacyon to what intent I pray you sacrifyce they for
the dead? Ioh. iiij.
If the Lord must be worshipped in spyrite and truth / why wynke these persons
at the doctrine and fact of them which bid men to worship him in bread?
Therefore may we cry with Elyas / how long halt ye on both sides? If the
sacryfyce of Christ be absolute or sufficyent: think stedfastlye that by that
only sacryfice you be made perfect for evermore. But if there be sacryfice made
daily in the mass. Then believe that you be clensyd through daily sacryfices.
These things can not stand nor agree to gether. More over no man need to blind
him self with these words / high mass / and low mass: In the high mass
are the selffe and same abhominacyons which are in the loweste. In both of them
/ is the institucyon and ordynaunte of Christ perverted / in both of them is he
worshipped in the broad / in both of them are ydolles served / in both /
specially in the service of saynctes is help ask de at creatures. In both of
them is the wicked ca^non the greatest portyon of the mass. There is nothing in
it of old antiquite: nothing of the apostolic simplycite. Furthermore we must
also mark in specially / in this matter / how the scripture requires of us no
cloked / but an open confession. Now by ceremonies and the use of ceremonies we
do chefelye confess whath faith we be of. He that being requyryd stondyth by
at the Turks and gentyles service / grauntyth him self to be a pertaker or
fauerere of the supersticion of the Turks and gentyles. He that is present at
the mass when* he is requyryd / does openly testifye / that he does
acknowledge the mass / and the masses relygyon to be the true service of God.
Therefore by his presence / he establysseth all the erroures of the mass. He
that will not be present at mass / him take the adversaries for a co^te^ner of
there service / and all the whole papistrye. Wherefore by what reason that we
know that the open confession of Christ is requyryd of every one of us / how
little of reputacyon so even he be: By the same believe we also / that they be
utterly forbidden to have any part with the mass. Nether is it sufficient
for us to believe in the heart and secretlye to confess God. The syncerefull
and plain confession of the tongue must go with all. We have of Orygene / that
there was a certain sect called Helchesaytes / which tawght this heresy that
if in persecucyon any man showld deny / (I use Eusebius words in his
ecclesiastical history / the.vi. book the.xxviij. chap.) the same were in no
taute / because he that has a steadfast heart to God / alltough he deny with
his mouth for necessyte / yet in his heart he abydyth in the faith. But I
purpose not to dyspute now this questyon at large. I have notyd some what
concerning this matter long agoo / in my commentaryes upon the.viij.ix. and.x.
chapters of the first epistle to the Corynthians: and upon the epistle to the
Hebrwes / again in the book de origin erroris / which I last ouerlokyd and
enlargyd. And this much have I written to the intent you may perceive that we
be playnelye / not of there judgment / which put afflicted persons in conforte
to goo to mass / we believe and do teach rather that the truth should be
plainly confessyd / and that all error owght to be spoken against / abhorryd
and shunnyd / and that we owght to dye / rather then to have any thing ado
with that wicked service. We know that throwgh much pacyence we must save owr
souls: we know that it behouyth us through many tribulacions to enter into the
kingdom of heaven. But if we may after such a sort according as the world
goyth / semble and dissemble / chope and change at our pleasure in matters of
religion / suerlye the most holy marters of god were ioles / that would have
nothing to do with ceremonies which were plain wicked. But there vpryghtnes
and, stedfastnes was acceptable unto the Lord / wherefore he also will not be
dyspleasyd at there holy pertynacite / which had rather suffer al manner of
extremite then once to make or meddle with the wicked service of the papystes.
These things may you be bold to say of us a foore good men and such as be in
troble for the truth / prayeng them to comend us with there prayers unto god.
More of this matter shall master John Becstayne declare you. For be herd mine
other brethren in the mynistracion of gods word dispute of this same
thing. Both Leo Judah / Casper Megander / Erasmus Fabricis / Conradus
Pellicanus / Theodorus Bybliander / and the rest / which all wyshe you good /
fare you well brother in the Lord. Love me / and remember me with your prayets
unto Christ.

At Tigurye. 18. Februa 1541
The Epistle of John Caluyne.
THe man to whom ye gave commyssion / required us to write your aouyse / how ye
might keep you from stayninge your self among so many spots of
supersticions / as in the stead of the pure and true service of god have gotten
place in the church there with you. As for me I suppose it shall be sufficient /
to declare you my mind brefely. Also / not hydyng from you what other men do
think in the mean season / consyderinge that there is some variau^ce in this
behalf. The same that other men would either deny or wyncke at / stand I at no
dowbte to affirm / namelye / that I utterly do not subscribe unto there
opinyon: So that at the least by this my simple confession / ye may
understand / that it shall be far from all feydnednesse what so ever I will
say. But this one thing will I hartelye pray you that in hearing me speak
of variaunte / ye will not be sore offendyd / as though ye might have no thing
of us / but that is wrappyd with controuersyes. For as ye shall hear / there is
very little varyaunce between us. They pondrynge how dangerous a thing it is
to snare men's conscyences in relygion / dare not condemn owght no unlawful /
that may by any mean be excusyde. More over when they consider how many
greuouse ways they be oppressid on every side / which syue in that captivity of
Babylon / they must needs fauer them in some things / least that if they
should be to importune upon them / it might utterly dyscomfort such as else
have a good zeal / and be indewed with a right fear of God. But I contrary
wise do hold / that it cannot be to straightlye kept / which the Lord has
bound by his word / and that the godly ought not to flatter them selves in
evil things / lest they be careless in remaynyng therein. Nevertheless I do
not deny / but that both the same their reasons are very good: they also
grant me gladlye mine objection. But it comyth to pass (I can not tell how)
that while they are to fervent upon there consyderacyons me think they are to
merciful. They also judge me to cruel while I remytte nothing. Verily there
is nothing that I am more loath to do / then to swerue / (how little so ever it
be) from the mind of such men as the whole church has worthelye in high
estimacyon / and whom I also pryuatelye have in reverence with all my heart.
Only of there goodness let them grant me this to receive nothing against the
judgment of my conscience. First with out any contrauersye / we all agree in
this / that a Christen man is bound not only to worship god spirituallye in
his heart / but also to testefye the same outwardlye. For as the Lord has
consecratyd our soul to gether with the body unto him selffe / so showlde his
glory appear in both / as S. Paul says: They do but fable therefore that
aftyrme it to be sufficyent / if a man keep the pureness of relygion inwardlye:
and that God regardyth not owtward things / so that the mind remain whole.
And yet not withstondyng / we do not require of every one / an open confession
of his faith / But that a godly man nevertheless endeavor him self / to
profess that worship of the only God and Christ which is commendyd unto us
in his word. Again / we have not appointed this professyon with certain
lymites / save only that every man (according to the measure of his
understanding facultye / and as occasion is offryd him) do in any wise apply
him self to sanctifye the name of god. Wherefore in this matter / we must
handle more with exortacions / then with determinable rulers. For as the
faithful nether may nor owght to be constraynyd to any certain rule / so do
they favor them selves to much / if but in part only and that slenderlye
they use the worship of God / and follow not still upon it continuallye and
with dilligent labor as long as they live. Let every man therefore be dyligent
and constant inforcyng him self and let him not leave of / till he have
specially perswadid him selffe in this / that he omit no occasyon of
glorifieng god.

But one thing we affirm preciselye / that they which receive such vsages as
are notable in manifest ungodliness / do swerve from that professyon of faith
which all Christen men owe unto there Lord. For seeing that the Lord has
instituted ceremonies / whereby we may be exersysed towerd the sincere
worshippinge of him / verily like as in practisynge the same / we testefie our
selves to be the worshippers of the living God / even so in vsyng such other as
have the apperaunce either of idolatrye or supersticion / we both dishonor
the name of God / and defile our selves. iij. Regu^. xij.
For they finally remain undefiled / that nether bow there knee unto Baal /
nether kiss his hand / ner swear with there tongue by another name / then by
the name of the living God. In these things we do not varye. But when we come
to discern ungodly vsages from such as be good and according to relygion /
there we some what varye: Wherein yet I grant them this / that some vsages
therbe which either came up of a little supersticyon / or else are degenerate
into some supersticyon from there good origenall / the obseruinge whereof were
not to be reprehended / if it lacked supersticyon. As for ensample: They that
first lighted candels at the table of the Lord / swarued some what from the
pureness of the gospel / bringing in a ceremony which yet being good / was
at the coming of Christ abrogate with other persels of the Iewesdome / yet the
same affliction of comeliness / (as fond as it is) when it proceadeth not to
ungodliness / there is no of fence of God in observing it. Other things were
well institute / which through abuse are swarued from there truth / which I
permytte the godly also to observe / so that the abuse be not fallen to
manifest ydolatrye. Nevertheless as conseruing the^ both / it were verelye to
be desired / that they were either wholye abolyshed / or else playnlie that they
were refourmyde. But because that lies not in a pryuate man's hand / let him
not refuse to follow the custom received in his church / which custom by
right he had rather were taken away / or else reformyde: let him not refuse it
/ I say / if he be brought to it hy necessyte: but as long as he may with out
offense / let him refrain from it / that by his rare vsyng thereof / he may
declare / that he does not greatly allow it.

Here now am I constrained to dissente from certain learned men / whom I else
esteem as fathers / because that among this sort they reken the high mass
and certain other such ceremonies: for they esteem it to proceade of the
supper of the Lord / though it be dyuersely stained and polluted. And yet do
they not deny / but that the opynyons which are of it be wicked and against
God such as a godly heart ought to abhor. Nevertheless they judge that a
pryuate man is to be excused / which while he may not have the supper of the
Lord purely mynystred / does not refuse it / torn and rent as it is. But I
can not be brought to esteem it for the supper / though the authoures thereof do
color the name of it never so much. iij. Reg. xij. c
For Hieroboam also would that the calfes which he set up / should sheme to be
instruments of the Jews religion: And the same verily was done contrary to
the Lords commandment / so that it was no more lawful to offer there / then
to do sacryfyces unto the ydolls of the heythen. Considering therefore that I
esteem the mass for a very abhomynacyo^ / which after no other wise is deckte
with the name of the holy supper / then as an angel of satan transfygureth
him self into an angel of light / I can not se under wat pretense a godly man
being illumynate with Gods word / may have it in reverence as a pure
ceremonye of God. lj. Corin. xi. v
For over and besides that it is manifest / that Christ with the holy
mynystracyon of his supper is there had in derysyon: a devout conscience will
not presume to apply unto it / the promyses that were given unto the supper.
Nether avails the excuse which some men bring in / that a godly man and such
one as fears God / comes not save only to be partaker of the prayers and
Sacraments with the faithful / but abhors from all the ungodly acts which
there are executed / and in the secret affection of his heart does hate the
things that he openly can not improve. For he only auoydeth ydolatrye / that
refrayneth from the sacrifices of ydolles.

The mass verily is an ydoll set up in the temple of God: when thou therefore
art at it / thou stondest before the simple / and geuest very evil ensample /
for they think / thou worshyppest whatsoever abhomynacyon is in the mass. i.
Cor. x. ^
I will stond no longer in this matter / when Paul to the Corinthians does
suffycyently declare / that he is a partaker of the cup of deuells / which
although he do it without conscience of superstycyo^ / only by outward
ensample / medleth with profane vsages: and moreover that he is gyltye of
blood / because he confirms the error of the ignorant by his ensample.

Where as it is alledgyd / that there with you the church is / whose communyon
is not utterly to be excluded / that argument also is easelye dyssolued. For
the church is taken sondrye ways. Therefore according to the diverse estimacyon
thereof / we must prudentlye dyscerne / after what sort the church of yours is
to be reputed. As for me verelye / I believe that the catholyke church is
scattered abroad in all such places as are kept under / through the tyranny
of the Pope. Romans xi. v
For seeing that the Apostle does testyfye / that God can not repent him of his
calling / as he gathers of the Jews that they shall never depart wholly
from the grace of God / which are ones received into the inuyolable couenaunte.
Even so may we reason now / that among all nacyons to whom so ever the Lord
has appointed the eternal covenant of the Gospel / the power thereof
remains still: yea they have Baptyme also a scale of the covenant / which
can not be without effect: For how greatly so ever the multitude self have
swarued unto ydolatrye / yet through the unthankfulness and unfaithfulness of man
/ can not the will of the Lord be hyndred / but it must forth / wherefore we
conclude that the Lord has allwaye had and yet has his elect / whose
salvation is scalyd with such a seal of baptyme / as is nether vain nor
without any undoubted strength. And because Baptyme is a sacrament of the
church / the Lord would that the calling upon his name and some apperaunce of
the mynystracyon should still remain there. But as concerning the very proper
bewtye of the church such as is expressed unto us in the scripture / that do
not I knowledge to be the congregacyons of the papystrye. The church is it
whom Christ commanded to obey and harken unto: but why? even because it is
the pyller and stablyshement of the truth. As for those they are the nestes of
errors and heresies / which by all means go about to over throw the word of
God / and set up ydolatry in the stead of Gods true worshype: yea all kind of
abhomynacio^ in the place of true godliness. Finally I judge her to be such a
shape of the church / as was among the Israelytes / after that Hieroboam had
set up a temple and the calves / contrary to the word of the Lord. iij. Reg.
xij. ^
For wyckedly all things were peruertyd among the^ / yet for the honor of
Circumcision the Lord vouchsaued to grant the people the name of a church /
and therefore by Ezechiel he called them his chylderne that came of them. But
would not the Prophets therefore have granted / that any man might have
worshypped in Bethel / under that pretense because the church was there. Amos

Thus ye se now how far we agree / and how great dyuersyte is between us.
This do certain and godly men require of a Christen man as well as I: first
that he serve God with the inward pureness of his heart / and then with owtwarde
exercyses of godlynes to testifye the worshype of the sprete: This profession
do we think to consiste in two parts / in the confession of the tongue / and
in holy obseruaunces. In declarynge your faith we can prescrybe you no measure
/ but that according to your vocacyo^ / ye seek all occasyons / that the name
of God may be sanctyfyed by you. But specially ye must labor to have your
household well taught in religion. For the Lord in making you ruler over your
children and servants has not only put you in trust with them that ye
should govern them in there duties of cyuilite / but also to bring them up in
godliness. Touching the second part we think thus / that al such ceremonies
as do conteyne either manyfeste ydolatrye or open ungodliness / are contrary to
the profession of that religion / which a godly man is bound unto: wherefore
the worshipping of images and sellyng of Masses (that a man should bye the^
with monye) and such other like things / we plainly disalow. And in this are
not godly and learned men against me / that it is also a Christen man's duty to
eschew those ceremonies / which sprange of error and couetuousnesse / and
saints holy days / where there is nothing that resembles or is like the holy
antiquite of the church: but many things are there profane and impure. For the
word of God is there shamefully and miserably perverted: and prayers there be
which are either fond and unsavory / or else full of blasphemies. Under the
same kind do we comprehend pardons / brotherheades or fraternites / holy
water and such like / whose beginning has not been alowable / and the abuse
(yea the very use of the^) does plainly rob God of his honor. Now have we
to speak of such as do perteyne nigh to the keeping of the communyon of Christen
felashippe / concerning the which my conscience will not suffer me to be of
like opinion with those right virtuous and excellent men. For they judge that
men owght not to forsake the communion of a congregacyon / wherein the
couenaunte of the Lord remains / and where his name is called upon. There
counsel is therefore / that men (specially on the sondayes) do perticipate
with the^ in prayers / because that then commonly the people assemble for this
intent / to call upon God: And the prayers which are made / be the more pure /
because they are of the old church: They consayle men also to be present at the
Mass as at the Lords supper / which how wonderfullye so ever it be defiled /
deformed / rent as^nder on every side / corrupt and poluted with wicked
opinions / yet by means of the certaynte of Gods promise / it remains the
supper for the faithful. Nevertheless in the mean season they inioyne two
things / that as often as a Christen man goes to the Mass / while he him self
may not reform the abhominacions that there appear / he re^uyre of God by his
prayers a reformacion thereof: And that then to his pour / as occasion
requires / he does his diligence that he seem not to consent unto ydolatrye /
nor to such rytes or vsages as do rob God of his honor / but that he may
be perceived to seek God and his pure worshepe / and utterly to refuse all such
things as are contrary to his Gospel. A certain godly and learned man adds
more over / how that he wyssheth that the same person who soever he be /
should communicate at the table / whereby he may the better testyfye / that he
seeks there the supper of the Lord. But I would wyshe verily with all my heart
/ that the servant of Christ should reuelently take what so ever he seith there
apperteynynge to his Lord / so that he defyle him self with any uncleanness.
Notwithstanding because I se no way whereby the filthynesses of satan might be
seperatyd from the holy ceremonies of our Lord and sauyoure Jesus Christ. I
can in no wise suffer the outward exercyses of religion to be had in such
price that the temple which is dedicate unto god / should be stained with
ydolatrie. Wherefore if ye can there use the things apperteynyng unto Christ /
so that ye Join your self to no wicked and ungodly ceremonies I will gladly
grant it you. Else I can in no wise be brought to give you leave for to do that
which in my judgment is clerlye against the profession of a Christen man How
then (will ye say) must I not then other change my dwelling / or else
despair? That do not I so presyselye require. Nevertheless my desire is /
that ye daily call your self unto an accomptes / and cast with your self
earnestlye how far from rendrynge unto god the worship that ye owe him. And
this may ye bem one the myserye of your captyuite unto him which only can
amend it / and in treat him by your continual prayers / that he will restore
lybertye unto his people / and renew his holy cite / wherein pure and sincere
sacrifyces of praise or thanks geuynge may be offrid up unto him. For it is no
small scourge of the lord / that ye are constrained to serve strange gods.
Therefore must ye nether mynyshe it with vain consolations ner favor your
self in so great infyrmyte. Wherefore se that ye have allwayse in mind / what
miserable case ye stand in. That ye may with the more earnest desire go about
to be rydde of it. Such an humble mind will not the lord for sake / but
either make some way of fynall delyuerau^ce or else socoure you through his
mercy. Fare well. The Lord bless you and your howsolde.

Amen. Laus Deo.
