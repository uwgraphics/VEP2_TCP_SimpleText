AN INFORMATION to all good Christians within the Kingdom of ENGLAND, from
the Noblemen, Barrons, Borrows, Ministers, and Commons of the Kingdom of
SCOTLAND, for vindicating their intentions and actions from the unjust
callumnies of their enemies.



EDINBURGH, Printed by JAMES BRYSON, ANNO DOM. 1639.

AN INFORMATION To all good Christians, etc.
THE work of reformation now renewed, and far advanced in this Kingdom, has
in the whole progress, met with all the opposition which the subtle malice of
Romes emissaries our adversaries could plotte. But God has hither-to
disappointed all their intentions, and turned Achitophels wisdom into folly:
And now when they cannot beat down the walls of JERUSALEM, they labor to
undermine it with calumnies, according to the damnable maxim, and calumniare
audacter, semper aliquid haerebit, and like Tobias, Sanballat, and such like,
will not be wanting to oppose mightily the building of Ezra and Nehemiah, by
saying to the King, Why is the rebellious city builded? The same steps are now
traced by the authors of novations, in this Church, who taking the advantage
of their opportunity (which we want to our great regrate) and being greatly
assisted and stirred up by some of their own coat, perniciously and popishly
affected, do there-upon presume to whisper unto his sacred Majesty, and spread
abroad in the neighbor Kingdom of England, most untrue, and damnable
aspersions, (by and attouer the particulars laid to our charge, in the
Proclamation, 18 of December, which are largely answered in our Protestation
already published) venting with equal impudence and malice, that we do only
pretend religion, but do intend to shake off the most lawful yoke of
authority, by changing the form of civil government; to invade our neighbor
kingdom of England, and enrich our selves by the spoils thereof. Although our
conscience bear us testimony against these untruths, and make us think
charitably, that no men understanding rightly Religion and Policy, will grant
belief unto these aspersions, forged against the body of a Church and
Kingdom; yet being certainly informed, that the authors of our novations and
the arch-enemies of reformation, have labored to poison his Majesty's sacred
Ears with those imputations, and dispersed the same with open mouth among the
subjects of England, we were forced to vindicat our innocence and wyp away all
impressions which those challenges might make in the belief of any, first by
our Supplication given into the Lords of secret Council 31 of January, and now
by this our answer and public declaration to the world: whereby we take GOD
to witness, that Religion is the only subject, conscience the motive, and
reformation the aim of our designs: For attaining whereof, we have never
strayed from the humble and loyal way of petitioning his Majesty for legal
redress; but do yet, according to our bound duty, beg the consummation of
our happy beginnings, by the holding of the Parliament, for the ratification
of the acts of the Assembly indicted by his royal authority; and as we have
often hereto-fore professed in our Supplications, religiligiously sworn in our
solemn Covenant with GOD Almighty, and publicly declared before GOD and men
in all our Protestations, made in the view of heaven and earth, that we had
never the least intention to cast off our duetifull obedience unto his
Majesty's most lawful authority; So we do hereby renew the same, and
solemnly declare, that our loyal breasts have never harbored any thought
against our gracious Sovereign, his Person, and government, to whom we daily
and earnestly pray the KING of Kings, to grant long and happy reign over us;
and when he shall be crowned with immortality, that there may not want one of
his Seed rightly to rule us, and to sit upon his throne, so long as the Sun and
Moon indureth. For we acknowledge that he is the Lords Vicegerent, swaying
the Scepter of this Land, transmitted to him, by succession, of so many royal
Ancestors, as none other King in the world can parallel the same, and none
other Nation compare with us in the glory of Antiquity, under that lawful
subjection, to one Line of native borne Princes: which we will never deface, by
any unnatural and impious cogitation against the Lords Anointed; but heartily
wish that shame and confusion may be printed upon the face of his enemies, and
that we might be happy in the occasion to expose our lives and fortunes to
the greatest hazard, for maintenance of the Person and authority of our dread
Sovereign, and increase of his honor. Let mercy and truth preserve the King.

As for our intention to invade England, we attest the everliving GOD, who is
conscious of our most secret thoughts, that we never had any such design or
motion, to offend or wrong in the smallest measure any other Nation, much less
our neighbor Kingdom, living in one Isle, under one King, with as li^le
controversy, and as much affection, as has been betwixt two Nations once at
variance, but now happily reconciled, and tied together by most strait bands,
which we desire rather to increase then diminish by any act of unjust
hostility. And albeit we be confident that the inprobabilitie of this
challenge, will stop the way of all credit to it; yet to confound these
reporters in their malice, we will shortly relate our regrats and fears, our
desires and resolutions, with that freedom and sincerity, which may evidence
our brotherly respect to the subjects of England, and control the false
surmises of intentions against them: we regrate together with our dear
Christian brethren of our neighbor Nation, that we should have so evident and
sensible experiences of the dangerous plots set afoot, and entertained by the
Churchmen of greatest power in England, for introducing novations in Religion,
by corrupting the Doctrine, changing the Discipline, daily innovating the
externalworship of GOD, preaching publicly, and maintaining points of
Arminianisme, and heads of popery, defending and advancing preachers and
professors of that judgment, and allowing books stuffed with that doctrine,
fyning, confyning, and banishing all such as in conscience of their duty to
GOD, labor to oppose the doctrine, discipline, or worship of the Kirk of Rome,
by their incroaching and usurping upon the Kings Majesty's prerogative,
tyrannizing over the conscience, goods, and estates, of persons of all
qualities within that Kingdom: And not being content to keep within their own
precinct, did induce, assist, and encourage the pretended Archbishops, and
Bishops of this Kingdom, to press not only a conformity of this Church, with
that of England, in matter of ceremony, but also with the church of Rome, in
the points most substantially erroneous, as appears by these books of common
prayer and canons, found to be a mass of popish superstition, doctrine, and
tyranny, which was confessed to have been first plotted, then corrected and
interlined in England, sent down to their associats the pretended Archbishops,
and Bishoips of this Kingdom, to be printed and pressed upon the whole Church
here, without order or consent, as the only form of divine worship and
government of the Church, to make us a leading case to England: required by
their letters, Stars-men, Noblemen, and Burghs, to further the advancement
thereof, persuaded his gracious Majesty, to declare these books, full of
popish superstition, yet to be free of it, and to be fit means of edifying
this Church: caused his Majesty prohibit the lawful meetings, and humble
supplications of his Subjects, under pain of treason, and to esteem of his
good Subjects as of traituors and rebels, for discovering this wicked plot,
complaining thereof, and for their renewing of their national Covenant with
GOD, and their alledgance to his Majesty, to threaten them by public
proclamation, with utter exterminion, and ruin, has by their calumnies, moved
his Majesty to discharge under the pain of treason, the sitting of our free
general Assembly, indicted by his Majesty, after so many supplications, and
to ingadge his royal word of a Prince, to defend all disobeyers of the Church,
to threaten and prepare for an invasive war against his most ancient loyal
native Kingdom; to distrust all our supplications, oaths, and declarations,
ingenuously and humbly made, and thereby they have indevoured so far as in
them lies to alienate his Majesty's heart from his people, and estrange their
due bound affections from him, if it were possible; and in end for the full
accomplishment of their wickedness (as we are informed) have made his Majesty
follow the advice and counsel of professed papists, and to entrust them with
the chiefest charges of the arms and armies now preparing for the threatened
invasion of this Kingdom, and still intend to raise jealousies in the body of
the one Kingdom against the other, and so to commit them together, which we
beseech GOD to prevent, and hope it shall be above their malice: The LORD
opening the eyes of our Sovereign, and of our neighbor nation, to discover
that treachery, whereby nothing is intended but to join the two Kingdoms in
bloody war, that so reformed Religion may be extinguished and popery
introduced, which then may be easily effectuate, when both sides are weakened,
and so may be the more easily suppressed by the papists, having all power and
charge ^n their hand, being already too strong in England, and encouraged with
the expectation of foreign help, ready to accept that advantage, so much
prejudicial to his Majesty's honor, power and manifold declarations, for the
maintenance of the reformed Religion, whereof he is the defender. We have also
reason to regrate, that any within that Kingdom should give more credit to
false calumnies, cunningly invented to foment their jealousies, and make them
prepare for invading us their brethren, then unto our solemn Protestations,
Supplications, Declarations, and Covenant with GOD himself. Yet we are fully
confident, that such are only drawn there-unto, partly through the
misinformation of our adversaries, and partly for lack of clear information,
concerning our most loyal and Christian proceedings: And therefore do most
heartily wish, they may with wisdom and charity, suspend any further giving
credit to things of that kind, till they may have occasion to receive full
information of the truth And we regrate that any should think the standing of
Episcopacie in the Church of Scotland an just ground for invading of, and
making war against this Nation, and consequently to raise up the old
natiotionall bloodshed and quarrels, which are now happily changed into a
sweet peaceable conjunction of hearts and affections, seeing Episcopacie in
this Church, is contrare to our ancient reformation, confession of Faith, and
oath of this Church and Kingdom, whereby that government was abjured which
cannot reasonably offend any other state or Church, who may be ruled by their
own laws and warrant, but as in every matter which falls in deliberation to
be put in execution, Justice should be the mover and efficient, and benefit
either in profit or honor uses to be the end; So especially in this weighty
business, it should be well pondered, if this act of invading us by war, for
keeping our oath to GOD, and obeying the lawful constitutions of our Church
and Kingdom, be just upon the part of the invader, or if the benefit of
re-establishng Bishops upon us will recompense the loss of so much Christian
blood, and hazard of dissension and war, whereof the event depends upon the
LORD of hosts: but it is obvious to every man's consideration, that this war is
by our adversaries intended for another end, and has a more deep dangerous
reach: other wise the Prelates if either good Christians or patriots would
rather quit their Minion ambition, and worldly pomp, then ingadge two
Kingdoms, with the hazard of true Religion.

And that none may suspect the sincerity of our intentions, the lawfulness of
our proceedings, or the truth of our declarations, and accusations against the
enemies of our reformation and peace, we are able, and wish to have occasion
to justify the same before the world: for unless we should have closed our
own light, and resisted the known will of GOD, acknowledged, subscribed, and
sworn by his Majesty, and our predecessors, in a solemn Covenant with GOD,
and so often confirmed and ratified by acts of this church and kingdom, since
the reformation, we could not omit any thing which we have done. And albeit we
be an Church and Kingdom, as free, ancient, and independent, as any other in
the world: yet for clearing the mind of our neighbor nation, from all
misinformation, and mis-construction of our intentions and proceedings, and to
verify the lawfulness, and absolute neeessity of our actions, and acts of the
late Assembly, we do assure our selves, that if the Estates and Parliament of
England, were conveened, and the whole progress of this business faithfully
represented to them, they would without doubt be so far from censuring or
condemning what we do, that they would rather be moved to become petitioners
to his sacred Majesty on our behalf, and approve of the equity and loyalty
of all our proceedings in this cause: And therefore in the mean time, we
entreat that no true English heart entertain any jealousies of us, who are
confident of the innocence of our proceedings and intentions, free hither-to
of all blemishes against our Sovereign or neighbor nation, as we do beg the
occasion of manifesting the same to them, and to all the world, as we have upon
the knowledge of these mis-reports of us, cleared our selves of any such
intention by our great oaths every one to another at our most frequent meetings.

The obtaining of this our so peaceable and just desire, shall not only be
comfortable to us, their Christian brethren, serving as a farther tie to unite
our affections in time to come, and stir us up to pour our hearty prayers
to GDO on their behalf, but without all question, the righteous Judge of all
the world, shall make you reap the fruit thereof one day, and who knows how
soon.

In the mean time our care shall be upon all occasions to make it appear
clearly to all the world, how far it has always been (and by the grace of
GOD ever shall be) from our intention first or last, to offer the least act of
hostility to our neighbor Kingdom, except in so far as we shall be
nececessitat in our own defense: and though (as GOD forbid) we should be forced
thereunto, yet shall we remain unwilling to conceive things of that kind, to
flow from the body of that Kingdom, with whom we intend no national quarrel,
neither mind to wrangle with them, except in the case of invasion from them,
but rather that this stir has been contrived and set forward by some ill
affected persons to both kingdoms, with whom only our question is, and to whom
alone we may justly intend according to their desert, as men who are set to
ingadge both kingdoms in so bloody a war for their own base ends: and
although a party raised from among our selves, fomented, and maintained from
abroad, from whence we find the sinews of that body within our selves to be
derived and maintained, may justly seem to irritate, yet the vanity and
weakness of our intestine adversaries, even in this case of offense, is so
far from making us take fire, without manifest hostility offered, or
ingadging us in any violent course that may interrupt the brotherly love and
concord of these two Kingdoms, or blemish our holy profession in the least
degree, as we are confident, no malicious mis-reports of our common
adversaries, will induce our dear brethren to quarrel with us, for seeking to
enjoy our Religion in purity and our laws and liberties, according to the
fundamental constitutions of our Church and state, when we are so well
affected to them, as we are truly sensible of their grievous burdens, and
intolerable sufferings from the tyranny of their hierarchy, and the fearful
bondage they underlye from the wicked counsel of their Clergy, suggested from
Rome, and producing so dangerous innovations both in Religion and Policy.

This sincere manifestation of our real intentions, we find our selves
obliged, to publish for satisfying all good Subjects in our neighbor nation,
being confident they are as desirous to be confirmed in their good opinion of
us, and so to be armed against all slanders and calumnies of those that
endeavor the final overthrow and utter exterminion of the Kingdom of Christ
Jesus from this whole Island: whereof we pray God, to avert the danger, and to
grant us peace and purity, which is the height of our desire: for procuring
whereof we shall employ none other weapons (except we be enforced) but fasting
and prayer to GOD Almighty and humble supplications to our gracious Sovereign.

Revised according to the ordinance of the general Assembly, by me Mr. A.
Ihonstoun Clerk thereto:
