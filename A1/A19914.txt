MYSTERIA MEA MIHI
IN JEHOVAH PERILA ALTISSIMA VINXI



Thy Mottos like Thy mind, that's much retird:
With which when men of yore were once inspird,
They had their Heaven, and thought them selves most pure.
Which made them glorious in a life obscure
WORLDS glory is but like the lightnings flame.
That soon goes out, as kindled is the same
And if yer^out it go it ought does scale
Its lofty Cedar not the Shrub in dale
The H., content thee with thy state and place
If thou seek glory let it be by grace
I.D. Cambro Britannus
