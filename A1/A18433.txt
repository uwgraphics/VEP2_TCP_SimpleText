To the right worshipful Sir Gawen Carew Knight, John Chardon wishes
prosperity in this life; and in Christ Jesus our savior, life everlasting.
I Had no sooner ended this Sermon (rightworshipful) but some of my very
familiar friends wished, and in manner urged me to commend the same ^o you, or
to the good Lady your wife: unto whose request I thought good the rather to
yield, for that I knew right well what stoare you made of the Word, Mat. 13.46

In consideration whereof, I off^ this my poor travel unto you praying you to

Hosea. 4.1.
AVdite verbum Domini, filij Israel, quia iudiciu^ domino cum habitatoribus
terrae: non est enim ^^ritas, and non est misericordia, and non est scientia
Dei in terra. Maledictum and mendacium and homici^^^ and furtum and adulterium
inundauerunt, and ^^^guis sanguinem tetigit. Propter hoc lugebit ter^a, and
infirmabitur omnis qui habitat in ea.

Hoseae. 12.2.
^^dicium dominicum Judah, and visitatio super Jacob, ^^^ra vias eius.

Ergo, quid euigilas nummorum condere sacco^?
Quidue modus rabidae nullus auaritiae?
Quid gestis cupide terras coniungere terris?
Quid te Mammonae possidet alta sitis?
Quid tibi concilias tam largo foenore nummos?
Quid spolias fratres (non miserande) tuos?
Quid iugulas teneros, quos Christus diligit, agnos? Joan. 13.1

Quid Christo charas (perdite) perdis oues?
Quid non mendaces, quid non mendacia linquis?
Quid violas magni iussa tremenda Dei?
Quid tua non linquis periuria, furta, rapinas?
Quid tua sic lacerat liuida lingua bonos?
Quid sic scortaris, quid non piget ire Corinthu^^^
Quid fuscant oculos blanda venena tuos?
Quid non emendas mores, vestigia, gressus?
Qui sibi vult tantus cultus, amorque mali?
Quid sic decurris furiosae more iuuencae?
Quid tollis cristas, terra cinisque, tuas?
Quid sic defectu miserorum corporalanguent?
Horrea frumento quid tua plena iacent?
Quid non producis granorum, durus, aceruos?
Quid sepelis tanti munera tanta Dei?
Quid Lazarum spernis, quem morte redemit Jesus

Quidue tui superant te pietate canes?
Quid non scripturas voluis, medicamina vitae?
Quid non sacratum voluis (...)?
Volue, reuolue, precor: sic disces iussa Iehouae:
Sic been compones ordine quaeque suo.
Dudum terra fuit subito concussa tremore,
Aduentus magni tessera certa Dei.
Io. Chardon^s. Vigilate igitur, Mar. 13.35.

Luke, 21. verse. 25. THere shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in
the stars, and in the earth, the people shall be at their ^ittes end through
despair. The sea and the water shall roar, and men's hearts shall fail them
for fear, and for looking after those things which shall come on the earth:
for the powers of heaven shall move. And then shall they see the son of man
come in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to come
to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws
nigh. And he showed them a similitude: Behold the fig tree, and al other
trees, when they shoot forth their buddes, ye see, and know of your own
selves, that summer is then nigh at hand. So likewise ye also, when ye see
these things come to pass, be sure that the kingdom of God is nigh. Verily I
say unto you, this generation shall not pass, til al be fulfilled. Heaven and
earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass. Take heed to your selves, lest
your hearts be oue^ come with surfeiting, and drunkennese and cares of this
life, and that that da^ come not on you unawares. For as (...) snare shall it
come on al them that dwe^ on the earth. Watch therefore continually, and pray,
that you may obtayn^ grace to flee all this that shall come, an^ that you may
stand before the son o^ man.


THis Gospel (beloved) entreats o^ the second coming of our Savior Jesus
Christ unto (...) judgment: and it confirms that article of our faith, by
which we confess, and believe, that ye same Jesus, which take flesh of the
virgin, which suffered under Pontius Pilate, which was buried which rose again
the third day from the dead, and which ascended into heaven, shall come again
at the end of the world, to judge the quick, and the dead: when all that are
in the graves shall ^e^re the voice of the Son of God, John. 5.^9.
^^d shall come forth: they that have ^^ne good, to the resurrection of life;
^^d they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation. Whereof our
Savior took occasion to speak, by ^eason of the talk that he had with his
^^sciples about the temple of Jerusalem. For when the disciples wondered at ^he
gorgeous decking of the Temple with goodly stones, and costly jewels, ^^e said,
that the time should come, Luke. 21.^.
in which it should be destroyed, that there should not be left one stone upon
ano^^er, that should not be throwe^ down. Then the disciples asked him, saying:
Master, when shall these things be? And ^hie told them of certain signs and
tokens which should go before, lest they should faint, by reason of those
troubles which were at hand. This done, our Savior takes occasion to speak
of the universal, and latter judgment, and likewise declares what tokens and
^^^es shall go before the same. There shall be (says he) signs in the Sun
and in the Moon, and in the stars, and in the earth, the people shall be at
their wits end, through despair. The sea and the water shall roar, and men
hearts shall fail them for fear: and so forth. In which piece of scripture
w^^ have to consider: First, of the coming of Jesus Christ unto judgment:
Secondly, of the signs and tokens that shall go before his coming: Thirdly,
of the manner of his coming: Fourthly, of the cause of his coming: And fifthly,
how we ought to order, and to prepare our selves against his coming.

It is a thing firmly to be believed, that God has set a certain time of the
worlds destruction, though unknown unto us, because by the sin, and
wickedness of ungodly men, being meruellously polluted and accursed, it does
together with all other creatures subject to the same corruption, Romans 8.22.
desire a deliverance. Howbeeit wicked and ungodly men, whose delight is to
live carelessly in this world, suppose that the world shall still continewe as
it is, and that it ^^^l never have end. But wonderful is (...) and execrable,
that among the people of God should be Saducees; and among Christians such
kind of men, which of ^et purpose, against the manifest word ^f God, dare
boldly affirm, that the world shall have no end, that there shall ^e no
resurrection of the flesh, no life after this life, no reward for well doing,
(...) punishment for evil doing, and that the world, as it is now, so it has
been, and shall continue for ever. Which kind of men are plain Atheistes, men
which neither believe there is any God, or divine providence at all. Against
which apparent dotage, and wicked cogitations of wicked men, through want of
true knowledge, by the instinct of Satan, we have to arm our selves with the
word of God, and to confirm our consciences by the testimonies of holy
scripture. For the scripture does evidently prove unto us, that one day the
son of God Jesus Christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead, that all
flesh shall rise, and that the world shall h^^ an end. Es. 13.9.
Esaias says: The day of the Lord shall come, terrible, full of indi^nation,
furor, and wrath, to make the land waste, and to root out all the si^ners that
are therein. Es. 66.15.
The lord will com^ with fire, and his chariots like a whirlewind, that he may
recompense his anger with wrath, and his judgment wit^ the flame of fire: for
the Lord will iudg^ with fire, and with his sword all fleshe^ Daniel says,
Dan. 7.18.
I saw in a vision b^ night: And behold, there came one i^ the clouds of
heaven like the son ^ man, to whom was given power an^ dignity regal, that
all people, tribes, ^ tongues shall serve him. Mal. 4.1.
Malachy says* The day comes that shall burn a^ an oven, and all the proud,
yea and al^ such as do wickedness shall be straw, and the day that is to come
shall bun^ them up. Psalm. 96.13.
The Prophet David says: For he comes, to judge the earth, and with
righteousness to judge the world, and the people with his truth. And this
which the Lords forshewed by the mouths of his holy ^^phetes, our Savior
Jesus Christ ^^th confirmed. For in the 13. chap. af^^r the gospel of S.
Matthewe he says (...): Mat. 13.41.
The son of man shall send forth ^^s angels, which shall gather out of his
^ingdom al things that offend, and them that do wickedness, and shall cast them
^to a furnace of fire, there shall be wee^ng, and gnashing of teeth. And there ^e
lykeneth the kingdom of heaven to ^ draw net cast into the sea, Mat. 13.47
which when ^t is full, men draw to land, and sit ^wn, and gather the good
into vessels, ^^t cast the bad away. So shall it be (says Christ) in the end
of the world. ^e that there is nothing more certain ^hen that Christ shall come
unto judgment: Nothing more certain then that the fashion of this world
shall be changed. 1. Cor. 7.29. Romans 8.^3.
The fashion of this world that ^ow is, shall vanish: Not only the creature,
but we also that now^ mourn in our selves, and wait for the adoption of the
children of God, even the deliverance of our bodies, shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption, i^^ the glorious liberty of the sons ^ God, at the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ unto judgment. Howbe^ wicked and ungodly men
can not b^ persuaded touching the coming ^ Christ unto judgment, of whom S*
Peter prophesied long time ago. 2. Pet. 3. 3.
The^ shall come (says he) in the last day mockers, which will walk after
they own lusts, and say: Where is the promise of his coming? For since the
fathers dyed, all things continue in the same estate wherein they were at the
beginning. But this they know not, ^ that willingly, how that the heauen^ a
great while ago were, and that the earth that was in the water appear ^^ up
out of the water by the word of god by the which things the world that the was
perished, being ouerrunne with water: But the heavens and earth tha^ now are,
are kept by the same word in stoare, and reserved unto fire, again^ the day of
judgment, and perdition o^ ungodly men. Dearly beloved, be n^^ ignorant of
this one thing, how that ^e day with the lord is as a thousand ^^re, and a
thousand year as one day. The Lord that has promised, is not ^ack to fulfill
his promise, as some men ^^^nt slacknes: As who should say, Let ^^ man think
that therefore Christ shall ^euer come unto judgment, because he ^^th
procrastinate, and put of for a time, but let him think that he does it, for
yt he is patient to us ward, and would have no man lost, but would receive al
men to repentance. Romans 2.^.
Despisest thou the riches of Gods goodness, patience, and long sufferance? And
remembrest thou not, how that the kindness of God leads thee to repentance?
Which lenity of ^od, if thou do abuse, thou heapest thee together the
treasure of wrath against the day of vengeance, when shall be opened the
righteous judgment of God, which will reward every man according to his deeds.

And to the end that this thing might she rather sink into our hearts and
minds, and lest we should be altogether unprovided, our savior has to ^ us
of certain signs, and tokens the shall go before his coming. There she be
signs (says he) in the Sun a^^ in the Moon and in the stars, and the
earth the people shall be at the^ wits end through despair. The sea the water
shall roar, and men's hart^ shall fail them for fear, and for lo^king after
the things that shall come v^pon the earth: For the powers of he^uen shall move.
These five signs she go before the coming of Christ vn^ judgment. First,
there shall be sign^ in the Sun, and in the Moon, and ^ the stars: that is,
as S. Mark wr^teth: Mar. 13.24
The Sun shall be darkened, the Moon shall not give her light, and t^ stars
of heaven shall seem to fall. Secondly, in the earth the people shall be at
their wits end through dispain^ That is, as S. Mark again does u^terprete,
Mar. 13.8.
Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. Thirdly, the
sea and the water shall (...) roar: that is, there shall be cruel tempests,
vehement, and unaccustomed ^^^des. Fourthly, by reason of these, ^ens hearts
shall fail them for fear, and (...) looking after the things, that shall ^ne
upon the earth. Fifthly, the powers ^f heaven shall move, that is, there shall
^ee strange sightes in the heaven: and ^n the earth there shall be earthquakes
(...) al quarters. Briefly, the heaven, the ^^rth and sea, shall witness and
declare, the day of the lord to be at hand. Now (beloved) we our selves may
witness that most of these signs, and tokens ^re passed already. For we
have seen ^tra^ge Eclipses of the Sun and moon, ^ee have seen nation to
rise against ^^tion, and kingdom to rise against kingdom, we have heard of
cruel tempests, vehement, and unaccustomed ^indes, with other strange things.
And therefore we may justly prognosticat, yea and believe that the ends of the
world are come upon us, and that it will not be long before Christ will come
unto judgment. Behold (says our savior) the fig tree, and all other
trees, when they shoot forth the buddes, ye see, and know of your ow^ selves
that summer is nigh at hand. (...) likewise ye also, when ye see the things
to come to pass, be ye sure the the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand But we
have seen most of these come to pass, and therefore let us thi^ no otherwise
but that the kingdom God is nigh at hand, and that the lord is ready to take
his fan in his hand, Mat. 3.12.
purge his floor, to gather his where into his barn, and to burn the cha^
with unquenchable fire. Other toke^ there are besides these, to prove vn^ us
that the end of the world hangs ^uer our necks: among which, in i^
judgment, the preaching of the G^pel is not the least. For as our sa^^^ says
in the 24. chapter after the G^pel of S. Mathewe: Mat. 24.14
The Gospel of (...) Kingdom shall be preached through e^ the world, for a witness
unto al nation and then shall the end come. By wh^ words the Son of man does
plai^ declare, that about the time of t^ worlds destruction, the true, and
comfortable doctrine of Christ should be preached. Whereby it is gathered,
that the same was obscured and darkened, and almost defaced by reason of the
false Prophets and Apostles before that time. But now again by the
unspeakable grace and mercy of God, we do plainly perceive such a clear light
of the Gospel to shine over the whole world, that in spite of the devil, and
his adherents, it casts his bright beams over al nations. And therefore what
other thing may we look for, but (as Christ did foretell) a sudden downfall of
this miserable and wretched world. Another token of the overthrow of the world
is, because we do plainly perceive all things daily to wax worse and worse,
and to decrease in their virtue. For example: The air is oftentimes corrupt,
sometime with untimely showers, sometime with unprofitable dryness, now with
too much cold, and now with extreme heat: The fruitfulnes of the earth is
not such as it has been before time. Moreover, we may think^ and perceive the
foundations of the world to be worn out, and the same to be falling upon our
shoulders, when we sensibly perceive our selves to li^^ in those days of which
our Savior has foreshewed: I mean, eating an^ drinking, marrying and
married, buying and selling, planting and building. For never more did men eat
and drink, never did they faster marry wives i^ the days of Noe: never more
did they buy and sell, plant and build in the days of Lot than they do now;
which may prove unto us, that the ends o^ the world are come upon us. For as
our Savior says: After these examples shall it be, Luke. 17.30.
when the Son of man shall appear. And if we compare the time present with
that which is past, and set the manners of men before our eyes, we shall
perceive wickedness to have his ripenes, and to reign almost every where
without co^trolment. For notwithstanding that God thorot. A^ unspeakable mercy
in these latter days has given us the use of his most ^ly word, whereby we
should frame ^^r lastes and affections, according to (...) most holy will;
what desire of righ^^usnesse, what love of virtue, what ^^^e of godliness, or
what zeal of re^^^ion is there to be found? yea who is ^^t in Christianity,
either cold, or ^arelesse? We may now plainly see greatest vice to be
counted for chiefest ^ertue, and those men to be most commended, which of al
other for impiety ^^ght most to be dispraysed. For the ^rafty deceitful men
are counted wise, ^he covetous are called good husbands, ^he prodigal are
called liberal, and rich men are deemed the best men. Besides S. Paul
foresheweth, that in the last days shall come perilous times. 2. Tim. 3.1.
For men (says he) shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, bosters, proud,
cur^^ speakers, disobedient to father and ^^ther, unthankful, unholy, unkind.
(...) so forth. And when did men more ^et by themselves? When were they ^^re
covetous? When were they more proud? when more given to cursed speaking? when
more disobedient to father and mother? when more unthankful? when more unholy?
when more unkind? And to be short: when more given over to work wickedness,
Ephesians. 4.16.
and that with all kind of greedines, then at these days? And therefore it must
needs follow, the coming of Jesus Christ unto judgment to be nigh at hand.

Whose coming shall be in a cloud with power and great glory. In the first, of
ye Acts, Act. 1.9.
after the talk that our savior had with the Apostles, whiles they beheld,
he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they
looked steadfastly up to Heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in
white apparel, which also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gasing up
into heaven? This same Jesus which is taken from you into Heaven shall so come,
even as ye have seen him to go into heaven. But he went in a cloud into
heaven, and therefore he shall come in a cloud from heaven, with power, and
great glory: even as ^. Paul writes in the fourth of the (...) Epistle to
the Thessalonians. 1. These. 4.16.
The ^orde shall descend from heaven with mighty shout, with the voice of the
^rchangel, and trumpe of God. Such ^albe the manner of the coming of jesus
Christ unto judgment.

And what shall there then ensue? S. ^aule says: Then shall we which live,
(...) remain, be caught up in the clouds (...) ^^iete the Lord in the air.
But (say ^^u) shall not they that are alive, and ^^maine in the coming of the
Lord unto judgment dye? Yes no dout. For ^therwise S. Paul should be
contrary ^ himself in that he says, writing to ^he Hebrews: Heb. 9.27.
It is decreed that al men ^hal once dye. But they that so remain, and are
alive in the coming of the Lord, shall not dye by distaunces of ^ymes, as
they who are spent and con^^ed with diseases, and are buried. For they shall
not be buried, neither ^hal they dye being wasted, and consumed with long
sickness, but forthwith being extinguished, forthwith they she be changed, and
shall be caught up ^ the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Even as also the
Apostle writet^ in the 15. 1. Cor. 15.51.
of the first epistle to the Corinthes. We shall not all sleep, but we shall al
be changed, and that in a moment, and in the twinkling of an eye, a^ the
sound of the last trumpe. Bu^ what shall there become of those body which were
loosed from the souls before the coming of Christ unto iudg^ment? 1. These.
4.16.
Here S. Paul answers: The dead in Christ shall first arise: meanin^ that
the bodies that before the coming of Christ unto judgment ste^ in the graves,
shall rise out of the graves, at the sound of the trumpe, a^ the voice of the
Son of God. 1. Cor. 15.52.
For the trumpe shall blow, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and they
shall be changed. For this corruptible shall put (...) incorruptibilitie, and
this mortal sha^ put on immortality. And this is the which the Apostle again,
concernin^ this mutation and change, writes t^ the Philippians. Phil. 3.20.
Our conversation is in heaven, whence we look for the Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, which shall change our vile bodies, that they may be like to his
glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things to himself. And therefore the Saducees have foully erred, that denied
the resurrection of the dead: whereof Job being fully assured, says thus:
Job. 19.25.
I know that my redeemer lives, and that I shall rise out of the earth in the
last day, and shall be covered again with my skin, and shall see God in my
flesh, yea and shall behold him, not with other, but with these same eyes. For
if there were no resurrection of the dead (which the Saducees affirm) then
mark you what S. Paul infers: Mat. 22.23. 1. Cor. 15.16
if the dead (says he) rise not again, then is Christ not risen again. If
Christ be not risen again, then is your faith in vain, and yet are you in
your sins, and they also that are fallen a sleep in Christ are perished. And
if in this life only we believe on Christ, then are we of al men the most
miserable. And what auailed the great patience of Christians in all their
troubles, and cruel persecutions, if this doctrine of the consummation of ye
world, and of the coming of the Lord, with all that belongs theretoo, were
but a vain imagination of Christ, of the prophets, and Apostles, and of all
the blessed martyrs in the Church of God? What did it advantage the godly, of
al others in the world most miserable, to suffer most cruel torments, to be
racked, Heb. 11.35.
to be stoned, to be hewn asunder, to walk up and down in sheep skins,
and in goats skins, in need, tribulation and vexation, which the world was
not worthy of, wandering in wildernesses, in mountains, in dens, and caves
of the earth, and would not be delivered, were there not hope to receive a
better resurrection? That I have fought (says Paul) with beasts at Ephesus,
1. Cor. 15.32.
after the manner of men, what auantageth it me, if the dead rise not again?
But we meruel how the dry and rotten bones can be fetched out of the (...),
out of the earth, and ashes again. (...) that fetches the sun out of his
(...) every morning: he that quickneth ^he dead moon every month: he that
^^^sed Aaron his rod, Number. 17.8.
that had been many years dried, in one night to bud ^^^ssom, and to bear
ripe Almondes, (...) also bring the dry bones out of the grave, sea, and ashes,
and cause them to ^care ripe, and perfect flesh. And why should we doubt that
of a rotten body a perfect body may spring, since we see by daily experience
that of rotten corn, perfect corn does grow, and that of rotten seeds, and
kernels, perfect seeds and kernelles do come. Romans 8.11.
If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwells in you:
even he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal
bodies. 1. Cor. 15.22
For as in Adam all do dye, so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1. Cor.
15.49.
As we have borne the image of the earthy, so shall we bear the image of the
heavenly. As for the souls, after they be once loosed from the bodies, they
reign, either with Christ, or with Satan, either in etern^ glory, or in
everlasting sorrow. Which makes to the utter subversion and overthrow of ye
popish purgatory, and of tw^ damnable opinions of two sorts of Heretics, the
one called Arabici, and the other Dormitantij: the one affirming, that ^ soul
does dye together with the body, and that in the resurrection they shall both
be raised up together. The other affirming that the souls do sleep till the
day of judgment, then to be awaked, and then to receive, either damnation, or
salvation. Both which opinions are most wicked, and contrary to scripture. For
first, yt the soul lives, that it is immortal, and incorruptible, after that
it is once loosed from the body; the examples, and testimonies of holy
scripture do declare. David, no doubt, believed the immortality of the soul.
For when he perceived that the child was dead, he wept no more, but said: 2.
Sam. 12.23.
I shall go to him, but he shall not come again to me. The widows son of
Sarepta fell sick, and dyed, and Elias took him out of her bosom, 1. Reg.
17.19.
and laid him on the bed, and stretched him^^^fe upon the child three times,
and ^^led unto the Lord, praying that the ^^^es soul might come into him
a^^^ne. And the Lord heard the voice of ^e Prophet, and the soul of the child
(...) into him again, and he revived. The soul therefore does not dye with
^he body. The wise man says, that ^he body (which he names dust) shall
return to earth as it was; Eccles. 12.7.
but the spirit, unto the Lord that gave it. And in ^he second of Wisdom, Wisd.
2.3.
entreating of the ^^aginations of the wicked, which say: That after this life
their bodies ^halbe as ashes that are quenched; and that their souls shall
vanish away as the soft air, he says: That they do not understand the
mysteries of the Lord, that they have no hope of the reward of the righteous,
and that they regard not she woorship, that holy and blessed souls shall have.
Wisd. 3.1.
And in the chapter following, speaking of the souls of the righteous, he
says: That they are in the hands of God, and that the fear of death shall
not touch them. Luke. 16.22.
The pa^ble of the rich man, and Lazarus, (...) evidently, and plainly proves
unto that the soul does not dye with body. For the soul of Lazarus was ried
by the Angels into Abraham bosom, and the soul of the rich (...) was buried
in hell. Our savior in (...) 10. of Matthew. Mat. 10.28.
comforting his discipl^ wills them not to fear them t^ kill the body, and
be not able to kill soul. The soul therefore does not d^ with the body:
Secondly, that the sou^ do not sleep til the day of iudgeme^ the testimonies
of the scripture do d^clare. In the 23. of Luke, Luke. 23.43.
our Sauio^ said to the thief that did hang on t^ one side of him upon the
Cross: The day thou shall be with me in paradis^ As much to say: Thou shall
be wi^ me in a place of singular quietness a^^ pleasure, not there to sleep
till the da^ of judgment, but without all pera^uenture, to live, and to reign
wit^ Jesus Christ in eternal glory. Apo. 6.9.10.
And (...) the 6. of the Revelation it is declared that John saw under the
altar the ^^les of them that were killed for the lord of God, and for the
testimony that they had, crying with a loud voice, (...) saying: How long
tarriest thou (Lord, holy, and true) to judge, and to ^auenge our blood on them
that dwell ^on the earth? The souls then do not ^^eepe til the day of
judgment, neither do they perish with the bodies: but being loosed by death
from the same, are carried either unto eternal joy, or else ^^to everlasting
sorrow, unto which ^he bodies shall be gathered in the last day, to receive
every one according to that which they have done, whether it be good or evil.
For it stands with she eternal justice of the eternal God, she righteous
judge, that every man shall receive according to his deserts. Hereof Daniel
prophesied, whose words be these. Daniel. 12.2.
Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
everlasting life, and some to perpetual shame and reproof. And in the third of
the Prophet Malachy. Mal. 3.5.
I myself will come, and be a swift v^nes, against witches, against
aduou^rers, against false swearers, yea and against those that wrongfully keep
b^^ the hyrelings duty, which vex the w^dowe, and the fatherless, and oppre^
the stranger, and fear not me, saye^ the Lord of hoastes. Eccles. 11.9.
In the 11. chapt^ of the b^oke of the Preacher it is said Be glad (o thou
young man) in the youth, and let thine heart be merry in the young days, follow
the ways of thy^ own heart, and the lust of thine eye^ But be thou sure that
God shall brin^ thee into judgment for all these things He derideth those that
set their deligh^ in worldly pleasures, as though Go^ would not call them to
account, the^ which nothing is surer. For we must a^ appear before the
judgment seat o^ Christ that every man may receive the works of his body, 2.
Cor. 5.10.
according to tha^ which he has done, whether it be good or bad. He will come
shortly, an^ his reward is with him, Apo. 22.12.
to give euer^ man as his work shall be. Romans 9.7.
Praise, honor, and immortallitie to them that ^time in well doing, and seek
eter^^ll life; but unto them that are rebel^^^^, and disobey the truth, shall
come ^ignation, and wrath, tribulation, and ^^^^she, upon the soul of every
one ^^^t does evil, of the Jew first, and ^^ the Gentile. 2. These. 1.6.
For it is verily a righte^^s thing with God, to recompense ^^ibulation to them
that trouble you; (...) to you which are troubled, rest ^^th us, when the Lord
Jesus shall ^^we him self from heaven with his ^ighty Angels in flaming
fire, ren^^^^ vengance unto them that know ^t GOD, and to them that obey not
^^to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which shall be punished with
e^erlasting damnation from the pre^ence of the Lord, and from the glory ^f his
power, when he shall come to be ^lorified in his Saints, and to be made
^eruellous in all them that believe. ^ohn saw by Revelation the dead, Apoc.
20.10
both ^^eat and small, stand before the Lord, (...) the book to be opened, and
the dead to be judged out of that which wa^ written, according to their deeds
And he that was not written in the book of life, was cast into the lake (...)
fire. Jude. 1.14.15
And no doubt the time draws when this that John saw by Revelation shall be
fulfilled: when the Lord shall come with thousands of Saint to give judgment
against all men, an^ to rebuke all the ungodly among them of all their ungodly
deeds, which the^ have vngodlyly committed, and of a^ their cruel speakinges,
which vngod^ sinners have spoken against him: which it must needs follow, as
a necessar^ consequent, that the state of good me^ in the coming of Jesus
Christ vn^ judgment, shall be most glorious, an^ the state of the wicked most
miserabl^ Which comes to pass clean contrary in this wicked world, when
most commonly the godly are with tr^^bles tormented, with banishment p^nished,
with the loss of goods impo^rished, and with all miseries ouerwhelme^ But
contrariwise the wicked are wi^ delycat fare nourished, with goods inri^^^d,
with offices preferred, and for auto^^e honored, as ye Prophet David in ^^se
words does bitterly complain. Psalm. 37.4.
My ^^ete were almost gone, and my treadings ^ad well nigh slipped. And why? I was
^reued at the wicked, to see the vngod^y in such prosperity. For they are in
^o peril of death, but are lusty and ^ro^g. They come in no misfortune like
^ther folk, neither are they plaged like ^ther men. Their eyes swel with fat,
and ^hey do even what they list. Verse. 12.
And a little ^^ter: Behold, these prosper in the ^orld, these have riches in
possession. Job. 21.9.
The houses of ye wicked (says Job) are ^eaceable without fear, and the rod
^f the Lord is not upon them. Their ^ullock gendreth and fails not, their
^^we calueth, and casts not her ^alfe. They send forth their chil^ren like
Sheep, and their Sons ^eade the dance. And therefore there ^^st be of
necessity an other life after ^his life, in which, according to the (...)
judgment of GOD, every one may receive according to their work^ be they good,
or bad, eternal glory, or everlasting infamy: even as David again to the
comforting of him self and the Church, tells us in these words: Then
thought I to vnderstan^ this, Psalm. 73.16.
but it was too hard for me, vnti^ I went into the sanctuary of God, and
considered the end of these me^: Namely, how thou set them in slipperi^
places, that thou may cast them dow^ headlong, and destroy them. O ho^
suddenly do they consume, perish, an^ come to a fearful end? Yea, even a^ a
dream when one awaketh, so makes^ thou their Image to vanish out of the City.
And because the infirmity o^ the godly is great, whiles they carr^ this
earthly tabernacle about them, that they cannot but fear, by reason of those
fearful tokens that shall go^ before the end, and consummation o^ the
world: therefore our Savior t^ their comfort and consolation speake^^ unto
them in this wise. Luke. 21.2.
When these things begin to come to pass, the^ look up, and lift up your
heads, for ^^r redemption draws nigh. Mea^^^ that they should not faint, but
(...) pluck up their hearts, and be ^^rry, for that they do prognosticate
(...) declare how that their redemption (...) at hand, when they shall be
delivered, (...) raunsomed, as it were from the ^^series of this life, in the
coming ^f the Son of God unto judgment. (...) consideration whereof Paul
cal^^^h this day the day of Redemption. Ephesians. 4.30.
(...) of this his deliverance he glori^^ in these words: 2. Ti. 4.7.
I have fought a ^^od fight, and have fulfilled my course, ^^d have kept the
faith. From hence^^rth is laid up in stoare for me a ^owne of righteousness,
which the lord that is a righteous Judge, shall ^^eme at that day not to me
only, but ^^to all them also, that love his com^ing. And therefore the day of
the Lord ^^^ht not to be terrible to the godly, ^^ither ought they to fear his
coming, (...) that he comes to deliver them, to ^t them at ease; but to
render to the wicked eternal pain. And I do firmly believe that the godly
have a thirst^ and a desire to enter into the courte^ of the Lords house;
Psalm. 84.2.
that they desir^ the day of Redemption; Luke. 11.2.
that they still cry: Let thy kingdom come: Tha^ they still cry, Apoc. 22.20.
Come Lord Jesus: Tha^ they look up, waighting his coming, Phil. 3.21.
which shall make their vile bodies like to his own glorious body* That they
desire, Apo. 21.2.
even a little show ^ that holy city, new Jerusalem, descending from heaven,
prepared of GOD as a bryde garnished for her husband For they certeinely
believe that the^ there shall be a full and complete end^ of all their
troubles. But the troubles of the wicked shall then begin^ The wicked shall see
above them a^^ angry Judge, beneath them an horrible pytte of hell, without
them ^ burning world, within them a gnawing conscience, on the right hand^
their sins accusing them, on the left hand the deuiles halling the^ to
torment. The wretched sinners th^^ s^ are besette, where shall they go? ^^h
then where shall they flee? Ps. 139.7.
Oh then ^^^re shall they hide? Oh whether ^^^ll they go then from his spirit?
or ^hether shall they go then from his ^^^sence? If they clime up into heaven,
^is there: If they go down to bell, (...) is there also: If they take the
wings ^f the morning, and remain in the vt^^rmost part of the Sea; even there
(...) shall his hand lead them, and his ^^^ht hand shall hold them. If they
say, ^^e darkness shall cover us, then shall their night be turned to day.
For the ^^rkenes is no darkness with ye Lord. The night is as clear as the
day, the ^^rknesse, and light unto him are both ^^^ke. Oh with what terror
shall the ^^cked be stricken in the day of the Lord? Oh in what fear shall they
be? Ap. 6.16.
They shall say to the hyls and rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the
presence of him that sits on the seat, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for
the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to abide it? The mockers
which have said: 2. Pe. 3.4.
Where is the promise o^ his coming? shall then see, and fee^ his coming, to
their great greef^ shame and confusion, when as, too la^^ repenting them
selves, they shall sa^ Tedious ways have we gone, Sap. 5.7.
but ^ for the way of the Lord we have (...) known. What good has our pr^^^
done unto us? or what profit has the pomp of riches brought unto us? L^^
these things are passed away like ^ shadow, and thus are we consumed (...)
our own wickedness. For the hope ^ the ungodly is like a dry thistle flower^
or dust, that is blown away with the wind, like a thin foam that is
scattered abroad with a storm, and a^ the smoke that is dispersed with the
wind, and as the remembrance of (...) stranger that tarryeth but for a day,
and then departs. But the righteou^ shall live for evermore, their reward
(...) with the Lord, and their remembran^^ with the highest. Therefore shall
the^ receive a glorious kingdom, and a^ beautiful crown at the Lords hand:
For with his right hand shall he cover (...), and with his holy arm shall he
^^fend them. Mat. 25.32
For when the Son of (...) shall come in his glory, and all the ^^ly Angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his glory, and before (...) shall
be gathered all nations, and ^^e shall separate the one from the other, as the
Shephearde deuideth the ^heepe from the Goats. And he shall ^et the Sheep on
his right hand, and ^he Goats on his left hand: that is to ^^y, the wicked,
whom he compares ^^to Goats. For as the Goats are ^^thy and stinking
beasts: so the ^icked, by reason of their sins, do ^tincke in the sight of
God. And as the Goats do stricke the gyltlesse sheep with their horns, so
the wicked do punish and afflicte the godly with their tyranny. And as the
Goats do destroy the orcharde and garden, so do the wicked destroy the
vineyarde of the Lord: as it is said in the third of the Prophet Esaias: Esaias.
3. 14.
Ye have eat up the Vineyarde, the robbery of the poor is in your house.
These Goate^ he shall set on his left hand. And the^ shall the king say to
them on hi^ right hand: Come, blessed children of my Father, inherit the
kingdom^ prepared for you from the beginning^ Then shall the king say to them
on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels.

Oh then how happy shall they be tha^ shall hear this joyful and happy
sentence of Christ, Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the beginning of the world. Oh then how unhappy shall they be,
that shall hear this terrible and fearful sentence: Go cursed into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil, and his Angels! Would God men did
consider of these things, and think upon this streite judgment in the fearful
day of the Lord, and as often as they consider hereof, whether they eat or
drink, or what ever they do, to think that the terrible trump of the Lord still
sounds (...) their ears: Arise ye dead, come away to ^^dgeme^t. But what do
they? Though ^^y hear it preached, that the day of ^^e Lord is at hand, yet
they continue ^^^elesse, they eat, they drink, they ma^^ and are married, they
pla^t, and they bild. They build as though they should live (...) ever, and
they eat and drink as though ^^ey should dye to morrow, saying: 1. Cor. 15.23.
Let ^s eat, and drink, for to morrow we ^^all dye. Whereas if they did but
think (...) the world to come, and remember ^^w that every one must give an
ac^^unt of him self unto God, they could ^^t, they would not live so wickedly,
so ^^^sually, so carelessly, and so ungodly, as ^^ey do: they would not vex the
father^esse, the widow, nor the orphane, and ^traunger, as they do: they would
not ^ake all fish that comes to the net: they would not draw wickedness unto
them with a coard, Esaias. 5. 18.
and sin as it were with a cartrope: They would prepare ^^d make ready
themselves to meet the bridgrom: They would observe the ad^^^^ition and
counsel of our Savior: who because he foresaw that iniquiti^ should
ouerflowe the world before hi^ coming, and that men would be careless about
the time of the worlds destruction, least we should be taken napping, tells
us what we must do, an^ how we must prepare our selves against his coming.
For as it is ^ great grief unto an earthly father t^ leese his Son, for
whom he has provided but a mean inheritance, s^ is it a great grief to
our heavenly Father, to leese any of us his children, for whom he has
provided, not a^^ earthy, 1. Pe. 1.18.
but an heavenly inheritance purchased not with gold and silver, which are
corruptible, but with the effusion of the most precious blood of the immaculate
and undefiled Lamb Jesus Christ. The admonition, or counsel of our Savior is
this: Take heed to your selves, least your hearts be overcome with surfeiting
and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that that day come not on you
unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the earth.
Watch there^^re continually, and pray that you ^^y obtain grace to flee all
this that ^^all come, and that you may stand be^^e the Son of man. In which
words ^ wills us first to be sober. Take ^de (says he) unto your selves,
least ^ur hearts be overcome with surfet^^^g and drunkenness. Among other
cre^^^res God has given to none so little ^^outh, as he has given unto man,
^cording to his quantity: which sig^^^eth, no doubt, that man should (...)
more temperate in meats and drinks (...) al other creatures. Besides, the
^^uth of a man is not bent to the earth (...) are the mouths of unreasonable
^eatures: to signify that man should ^^t eat and drink after the manner
^hrute beasts, but should moderate^^ use those creatures, which GOD ^^th
given, as necessary, and needful, (...) the preservation of life. V. Max.
lib. de insti. antiquis.


The ancient Romans were went (...) eat their meats in the open streets,
^^d were not ashamed to let the people to see what they did eat, that by the
example they might learn to be ^^ber. For there is not a more v^ and
pernicious thing, than surf^ting, and drunkenness. By surf^ting (says
Ecclesiasticus) man^ have peryshed. Eccl. 37.30.
Wine and dronkenesse (says Oze) take away (...) heart. Oz. 4.11.
Let the dronkardes and volu^tuous Epicures hearken unto the which is written
in the fifth of the Pr^phet Esaias. Esai. 5.11.
The words be these: Woe be to them that rise up early give them selves to
drunkenness, a^^ set all their minds so on drinkin^ that they sit sweating
thereat until it night. The harp, the lute, and shaul^^^ and plenty of wine are
at their fea^^ but the works of the Lord they d^ not behold, nor yet
consider the op^ration of his hands. Esai. 5.22.
Woe be to the^ that are mighty to drink wine, (...) to them that are expert
to aduan^^^ dronkennes. Awak ye dronkards (s^^^ the Lord, Joel. 1.5.
by the Prophet Joel) and w^^ and howl al ye wine suppers, beca^^^ (...) ^he
new wine: for it shall be pulled (...) your mouth. Pro. 23.31.
Look not (says Sa^^^) upon the wine how red it is, and ^^at a color it
gives in the glass: ^^^eth down softly, but in the end, it ^^eth like a
serpent, and stingeth like (...) Adder. Gala. 5.19.
S. Paul in the fifth to the ^^lathians reckons gluttony and dro^^^nesse
among the deeds of the flesh, (...) coupleth them with Idolatry, for^^cation,
murder, witchcrafte, and ^^ch like, most grievous and detesta^^^ vices, and
says, that they that ^^^mit such things, shall not inherit ^^e kingdom of
God. And therefore let ^^t our hearts be overcome with ^^^fetting and
drunkenness. 1. Pe. 4.3.
Let it ^^e enough and sufficient for us, that ^ee have spent the time that is
past (...) the life, after the will of the Gen^^les, walking in wantonness,
lusts, ^^onkennesse, in eating and drinking, ^^d in abominable Idolatry,
wherein ^seemeth to them a strange thing, that ^^e run not also with them to
the ^^e excess of riot, and therefore speak they evil of us, which shall g^
accountes to him that is ready to i^^ quick, 1. Pe. 4.7.
and dead. The end, no d^^ of all things is at hand: And th^^fore let us be
sober: 1. These. 5.6.
Let us not (...) as other do, but let us watch and be ^ber. For they that
sleep, sleep in (...) night, and they that be dronken, (...) dronken in the
night. But let us wh^^ are of the day, To. 13.11.
be sober. It is time the we should now awake out of slee^ For now is our
salvation nearer, the when we believed. The night is pass^ and the day is come
nigh. Let us th^fore cast away the deeds of darkene^ and put upon us the
armor of light^ Let us walk honestly as in the d^ light, not in eating and
drinking, neither in Chambring and wantonne^^ neither in strife and envying:
But (...) us put on the Lord Jesus Christ, a^^ make not provision for the
flesh, to f^fill the lusts, and desires of it. For is the will of God (as the
Apostle (...) clareth unto Titus) that we should ^nye ungodliness, Tit. 21.2.
and worldly lust, a^^ th^e should live sober minded, righ^^y, and godly in
this present world, (...) for that blessed hope, and glori^ ^ppearing of the
mighty God, and ^^r Savior Jesus Christ. Se^ly, our Savior wills us to flee
c^res of this life, for that the love ^^re of temporal things, does draw (...)
quite away from the love and de^ of heavenly, and eternal things. Ecc. 10.9.
^ere is not a more wicked thing, then ^^man to be in love with money. Mat. 6.24.
No (...) can serve two masters: for ey^ he shall hate the one, and love the
^r, or he shall cleave to the one, and ^^ke the other. Ye cannot serve God ^
Mammon. Who so ever will be a (...) of the world, Iam. 4.4.
is made the enemy (...). If thou will be perfect (said ^^^t to the rich man)
go and sell all ^t thou have, and give it to the poor, Mat. 19.21.
^ thou shall have treasure in heaven, (...), and follow me. But when ^ heard
that saying, he would none of ^^t went his way mourning, for he ^ great
possessions. These worldly cares were also the cause, Luke. 14.18.
why (...) came not, that in the Gospel were c^^led to the great supper. 1.
Ti. 6.9.
The sayin^ S. Paul unto Timothy is most tr^ They that will be rich, fall into
tem^tation, and snares, and into many fo^lish and noisome lusts, which drow^
men in perdition and destruction. F^ covetousness is the root of al mischi^
which while some lusted after, have (...) red from the faith, and entangled
themselves with many fold sorrows. 1. Ti. 6.17.
A^ therefore he willed Timothy to cha^^ them that are rich in this world, yt
the trust not in uncertain riches, but in (...) living God, which gives us
abunda^^ all things to enjoy them, laying vp^ store for them selves a good
foundati^ against the time to come, that they (...) obtain eternal life. But
when our S^uiour wills us to flee the cares of the life, his meaning is not,
that we sho^ leave a necessary, 1. Ti. 5.3.
and godly ca^ (which who so has not, has den^ the faith, and is worse than
an (...) fidell) but that we should not so (...) drowned in the cares of this
life, as ^^h we had no care of the word of (...), of the hasting of Christ
unto iudg^t, or of the world to come. He (...) right well, that gurmandise,
(...) cares of this life, would abound a^ the time of the worlds destructi^
and that men would be apt and ready ^llow such vices, eue^ to the last cast.
(...) therefore he says: Take heed to ^^r selves, least your hearts be
ouer^^e with surfeiting and dronkennes, ^^d cares of this life, and that that
day ^^e not on you unawares. For as a ^re shall it come on all the^ that dwell
the earth. Eccles. 9.12.
As the fish is taken with the ^^^e, and as the birds are taken with esnare, so
are men taken in the peri^^^ time when it comes suddenly v^ them. For though
it be certain that ^^^s Christ shall come unto judgment; of the year, the
hour, and time of his ^^^ing unto us, is altogether vncer^^e. For as our
Savior does say (...) the 24. chapter after the gospel of Mathewe: Of the
day, Math. 24.36.
and hour knows no man, Mark. 13.32.
no not the Angels o^ heaven, but my father only: no not the son him self,
as he was man. Mat. 24.27.
But (...) the lightning comes out of the Ea^ and appears in the West: so
shall the coming of the Son of man be.

As the days of Noe were, Math. 24.37.
so shall the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days of Noe, that
went before the flood, they did eat and drink^ marry, and were married, even
vnty^ the day that Noe entered into the Ark^ and knew not till the flood came,
an^ took them all away: so shall the coming of the son of man be. Likewi^^
also as it chanced in the days of Lo^ They eat, Luke. 17.28.
they dra^k, they bought, the sold, they planted, they built. And en^ the same
day that Lot went out of S^dom, it rayned fire and brimstone from heaven, and
destroyed them all. Aft^ these exampls shall it be, when the S^ of man shall
appear. The Apostl^ when they asked Christ, Act. 1.16.
saying: Lo^ will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? He
said vn^^ the^: It is not for you to know the ^^s, and seasons, which the
father ^^h put in his own power. The day the Lord shall come as a thief in
the ^^^ht: For when they shall say, peace, 1. These. 5.2.
^ace, all things are safe: then shall so^^e destruction come upon them, as
^^ow comes upon a woman in her ^auell, and they shall not escape. And
^^refore (beloved) take heed to your ^^^es, that your hearts be not ouer^^^e
with surfeiting and dronkennes, (...) cares of this life, and that that day ^^e
not on you unawares. Which ex^^tation teaches us not only how to repare our
selves against the com^^ng of Christ in the last day: but also ^w every
particular man should order in self against the coming of death. For death is
wont to set upon men, ^hen they think least thereof, when ^ey think to be
most merry, and when ^ey promise them selves that they ^^e many days to live.
An example (...) have in the 1. of Samuel, 1. Sa. 25.36.
in the.25 ^^pter, of Nabal, who held a feast, like the feast of a king, and
his heart (...) merry within him, for he was v^ drunk. Now in the morning w^
Abigail his wife after that ye wine (...) gone out of his head) had signified
(...) to him the purpose of David, his he^^ died wtin him, and he became as a
st^^ Likewise in the xii. of Luke, Luke. 12.16.
we re^^ how that the ground of a certain r^ man brought forth plentiful
frutt^ And he said within him self, what (...) I do? I have no room to lay my
fruit in: I will destroy my barnes, (...) buyld greater, I will say to my soul^
Soul, thou have goods laid up i^ stoare for many years. Take no^ thine
ease, eat, drink, and be merr^ But God said unto him. Thou fo^l^ this night
they shall fetch thy soul fr^^ thee. Take heed therefore, for eue^ when ye
think not upon, God wi^^ send his messenger death, to call us away. Now that
our Savior has told us what we should not do against the day of his coming:
He likewise shows us what we must do. Watch (says he) and pray
continually. First ^^^deth to watch. Math. 25.1.
In the 25. of Ma^^, our Savior lykeneth the king^^ of heaven unto ten
virgins, ^ch took their lamps, and went to ^te the bridegroom. But five were
^he, and five were wise. They ^t were foolish took their lamps, ^ took no
oil with them. But the (...) took oil in their vessels, with ^r lamps
also. Now whiles the ^^egrome tarried, they all slumbred (...) slept. And at
midnight there was ^ry made: Behold, the bridegroom ^^eth, go out to meet
him. Then the ^gins arose, and made ready their lamps. (...) ye foolish said
unto the wise, Give us of your oil, for our la^ps are gone out. But the wise
answered, Not so: least there be not enough for us, and you. But go ye rather
to them that sell, and ^^ye for your selves. But whiles they went to buy, the
brydegrome ^^e, and they that were ready, ^^at in with him unto the marriage,
^^d the gate was shut up. Anon after came the other virgins and sai^ Lord,
Lord, open to us. But he ans^red, and said, Verily I say unto you^ know you
not. Watch therefore: for know neither the day, nor yet the h^wer, wherein the
Son of man she come. Luke 12.35.
Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning, and ye yo^^selues
like unto men that weight f^^ their master, when he will return from the
wedding; that when he comes and knocks, ye may open unto him* For happy are
those servants, who^ the Lord when he comes findet^ waking. If he come in
the second watch or third watch, and find the^ so, happy ar^ those servants.
Verily, he shall g^^^ him self, and shall make them to s^^ down to meat, and
shall walk by, and minister unto them. Luke 12.39.
This understand you; If the good man of the house knew what hour the thief
would come, he would surely watch, and not suffer his house to be broken up.
Even so, if we knew in what day or hour the Lord would come, we would surely
watch, we would be prepared, and adourned, ^e would have lights in our hands,
(...) oil in our Lamps. But we do ^t know the day, nor hour, nor shall ^now.
And therefore let us be prepared, (...) man hour that we think not, Mar. 13.35.
will ^e son of man come. Watch (I say) (...) ye know not when the master of
^^e house will come, whether at even, ^ at midnight, whether at the cock
^wing, or in the dawning, least if he ^^me suddenly, he should find you
sleeping. Now if the evil servant shall say thus (...) his heart: Math. 24.48.
Tush my master will de^^re his coming, and shall begin to ^^uite his fellow
servants, and shall beg^n to eat and drink, and to be dronken, ^^e same
servants Lord shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour
when he is not ware, and shall give him his portion with hypocrites, there
shall be weeping, and gnashing of ^^eth. But contrariwise, Luke. 12.44.
if the Lord shall find his servant well doing, he shall make him ruler over al
his household. Watch therefore, and pray continually, that we may obtein grace
to flee all that shall come, and that we may stand before the son of man. Let
us pray that our flight be not in the winter, nor on the the Sabbath day: Mat.
24.^0.
For so our Savior counsels in the 24. of Saint Mathewe. For to walk in
the winter, it was not good, and upon the Sabbath day, it was not lawefull.
Meaning, that we should pray, and that with a steadfast, and ardent faith, that
the day of the Lord come not upon us unprepared. For if it do, we shall not
escape the euilles that then shall be, nor yet be able to stand safely before
the Son of man. Beloved, we have been warned to leave our surfeiting, and
drunkenness, and to forsake the superfluous cares of this life. We have been
exhorted to watchfulness, and to prayer, and still are we called upon for these
matters: Howbeit we are little or nothing the better. Mat. 12.4^.
The men of Niniue shall arise at the day of judgment to condemn us. For they
amended at the short preaching of Jonas. We have been called upon with often,
and long ^^eaching, and yet cannot frame to lay ^r^m us the old man, Ephe. 4.22.
that marreth him se^fe with deceiuable vanities. But let v^ think, and
believe, that the negle^ting of Gods holy spirit speaking in his prophets, can
not but provoke Gods heavy wrath, and indignation spedily to be powered upon
us. The heavens, the earth, and sea, have already witnessed the same against
us, which (unless we convert) in the measure of our sins he will power
forth upon us, and so we shall perish in his justice utterly, that in mercy
refused to embrace his truth obediently. Mat. 3.10.
Now is the axe put to the root of the tree, so that every tree that brings
not forth g^^d fruit, shall be hewn down, Mat. 12.33.
and cast into the fire. Either then make the tree good, and his fruit good, or
make the tree evil, and his fruit ^ill also. For behold, James. 5.9.
the Judge stands before the door. It is time for us to awake out of sleep,
and to gyrde up our loins, and to be ready with oil in our lamps, and to be
adorn with our wedding garments, that w^ may find entrance to the Lords
marriage. For since it is most certain tha^ Christ shall come to judge both
quic^ and dead, Romans 14.12.
since that every one of us shall give account of him self to God, 2. Pe. 3.10.
since the heavens shall pass away in manner (...) a tempest, since the elements
shall me^^ with heat, since the earth also, and the works therein shall burn,
since al these things shall perish, what manner persons ought we to be in holy
conversation and godliness, looking for, and hasting unto the coming of the
day of God, (...) which the heavens shall perish with ^^er, and the elements
shall be consumed with heat. ^. Pe. 3.13.
Nevertheless we look for a new heaven, and a new earth, according to his
promise, wherein dwells righteousness. Wherefore (beloved) seeing we look
for such things, let us be diligent, that we may be found of him in peace,
without spot and undefiled, growing in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord,
and Savior Jesus Christ, that in the end of the world, when he shall come in
(...) clouds, with power and great glo^ we perish not with the unbelievers:
which the Lord grant for his infinite ^ercy, and goodness, and for his chosen
^^^e, shorten these unhappy days, that ^^rruptible may be swallowed up of
in^^rruptibilitie, and mortal of immor^^^lity: And that as in this woeful
Egypt, ^e have found him a loving father, so in ^he world to come, we may
behold him ^ merciful Savior, Mat. 25.34.
and may receive that (...) and happiest blessing that never again shall be
revoked: which thing likewise the father of al comfort and consolation,
speedily bring upon us al, for the tender love of his beloved son Jesus
Christ: to whom with the holy ghost, three distinct persons in trinity, but
one eternal, immortal and most glorious God, be al praise, honor and glory,
now and for ever. Amen.
