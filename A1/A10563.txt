OF PVBLIQVE REFORMATION OF A CHVRCH.
Of this Reformation we are to know What it is. This reformation is a bringing
of men back unto God, by putting away evil, and by renewing the performance of
all holy duties decayed, especially in the public societies of Gods
children. 2. Chron 19. 4, 2. Chron. 34. 35. 2. King. 18. 4. 23. 4. 20. 2. Kings
23. 21. 2. Chron. 29 3, 25. 30. 30. per totum. 31. 2. ad finem.
2 The necessity of it, which may appear 1 By the commanundement of the Lord,
not only exacting of every see man repentance (whereof this is a most solemn
kind) but also giving charge for this matter, Ier. 7. 23, 24, 1. King. 18. 36
Psalm 2. 2 By the extraordinary ministry of Prophets, and other persons
when God so often raised up, taught, and assisted extraordinarily, that they
might be his instruments to bring men again to God and to reform things
amiss. Which extraordinary work if the Lord, done for the reformation of his
Church, declares the necessity of it. 3 By the fearful plagues which God
brought upon the neglectors of reformation. Eli, because he reclaimed not his
sons, and so the people which for the great iniquity of the young men
abhorred the offering of the Lord, lost the Priesthood, and make his neck.
The young men also perished in a great slaughter of the people. 1. Sam. 2. and
4 Ioash and his people, because they would not obey the word of the Lord in the
mouth of Zachariah, to reform that which was amiss, were forsaken of the
Lord, and delivered into the hands of their enemies. 2. Chron. 24. 20. 25 For
this cause the people of Amaziah fell before Ioash. Jerusalem was sacked, the
king himself taken prisoner, and afterward slain by treason. 2. Chron. 25.
16. 23. 24. 27.
3 The parts of this reformation, which are 1 Suppresu^ng of every idolatrous,
superstitious, filthy and strange hind, doctrine, office, use, or ceremony
remaining. Wherein heed must be taken, that no remnant of the aforesaid be
suffered to contunie, because such remnants provoke God to anger, and were
always hurtful to the Church. Judge. 8. 27. 2. Chron. 20. 23. 2 Conforming and
reducing of the whole state of the Church, that is to say, of the doctrine,
officers, form of government, order etc. of it, to their ancient integrity:
that is, to the prescription of the word, or of Christ and his Apostles, whereby
the Church was first established. See the 5. point. 2. Kings 23. 24. 2. Chron.
29. 25.
4 The persons who are to work this reformation, which are these. 1 The author
and efficient cause of reformations God himself. Esai 62. 7. who if he turn
not the hearts of men to obey his servants persuading to reformation it is
because he minds to destroy them. 2. Chron. 25. 16. 20. 1. Sam. 2. 25. Pro.
21. 12. 2 The instruments which ye Lord has sanctified for this work, these
are 1 The prince whose duty is 1 To call and compel both ministers and
people to return to the ordinances of the Lord, set down in his word 2. Kings
2^. 2. Ch^on. 29. 4. 5, 15. 2 To be himself foremost in the pra^ise of public
actions of godliness, that his example may ^ere up and strengthen other. 2. Sam.
6. 2. 5. 15. 16. 2. Kings 23. 2. 3. 3 To make laws for the co^ of reformation.
2. Chron. 15. 13.
2 The ministers, to who^ it belongs 1 To pray earnestly and contenually into
the Lord, for the setting up and reforming of his Church. Esaias. 62. 7 2 To make
known the word of Gain that behalf to the Prince and people. 2. Kings 2^. 8.
Exodus 4. 14 and 5. 1. 3 To join with the people, and to ^oe before them in all
their suites to them in authority, for reformation. Esaias. 62. 10. Exodus 4. and
5.
3 So many of the people, especially of the Elders, know the will of God, to
whom it belongs not only to join in prayers is God for the good of his
people. Hest. 4. 16. but also in prayer and godliness to join in this sun with
the ministers. 1. Kings 18. 30. Exodus 3. 18. and at the Princes commandment to
deface the monuments of idolatry. 2. Kin. 11 18. 10. 27.

5 The rule and squere whereby the servants of ye Lord must perform this
reformation, which is the word only, of which we are to observe 1 The reasons
why the word is to be used for ye only rule of reformation, which are First,
seeing to reform a church is nothing else buthe renewing of the first building
and beauty of it, and by the word only it was first built up and beautified:
therefore by it also it must be reformed. Secondly, forasmuch as the redressing
of every mus several ways is to be performed by the word. Psalm. 11 9. a whole
church cannot otherwise be reformed. Thirdly, since the Lord reproving the
ungodly for haing, reformation, verifieth it hereby, because they cast his
laws behind their backs, Psalm. 50. it cannot be avoided but the reformation of
a church is to be deruied from the word. 4 By the examples of such as at the
commandment of God, have either accomplished or labored any such reformation,
who always have brought and called men to the rules of the word of God. 2.
Kings 23. 2. 3. Nehem. 8. 1. 2. 3. 4. Nehem. 10. 29. Gal. 6. 16. Revel. 3. 3
2 The man not how to use this rule aright where men are to observe yt in
Abolishing things they must judge by the word, what is idolatrous, what
superstitious, what strange or crept in without warrant from the Lord. etc. and
so to abolish them. Co^forming. if it be In matters of discipline, 1 Where
express commandementes of Christ, and examples of the churches are found. 1
They must carefully mark of these commandments and examples, which are
tempora^ and extraordinary, which otherwise 2 They must embrace and (...),
without gainesaying and condictious that which is ordinary, not only as the
best, but as the only true and allowed ordinances of the Lord, leaving the
extraordinary things to the Lord, or whole only power it is to break the
ordinary rules of his word.
2 Where express direction i^ not found, as in some matters of order, and
other circumstances, they must take heed that they admit^ nothing which is
contrary to the general rules ^f order, comelines, and edification set down
in the word.
In doctrine likewise, where express and lasting rules are found, they must
receive them as the undoubted Oracles of God: where any thing is in question
that has not such pla(...)es they must order and determine every matter by the
analogy of faith.


6 The adversary eudeuors against in where we are to note the wilines of
Satan, which has a several charmeta bring a sleep it it may be, every one yt
has any hand in the work, as for the 1 Prince, he puts into his head by
flattering courtiers, etc. 1 That these seekers of reformation entend of
strengthen themselves, that they may the better rebel against him. Nehem. 2.
9. whereas the end of reformation is, that no disobedient person may he
suffered. Romans 13. 1. and reformation has never suffered men to rebel against
the enemies of it, how much less will it against the friends? 2 That such
exquisite reformation will make (...), and withdraw the people from following
their vocations. Exodus 5. 4. whereas contrariwise, reformation cannot away with
any that walk ^ly. 2 Thessalonians 3. 6. 3 That it is the honor of Princes not to
correct the doings of their godly ancestors, 1 Kings 12. 14. whereas the godly
kings are commended for reforming not only that which their wicked ancestors
brought in but also which their godly predocessors left unreformed. 2. Chron.
35. 18. 30. 5. 2. King. 18. 4. 4 That such Reformation will be more troublesome
^han commodious, which declares that these politiques are possessed with a
lying spirit, for how know they that the Lord will not give a blessing of
peace to his own ordinary. 2. Chron. 15 7. Again, what devil taught them
that greater trouble then commodity would be in serving God, as through the
abandoning of evil made not the troubles susteyed therein great commodities
and blessings to him that suffered them.
2 Ministers he moves tyrants to draw them back, 1 By accusing them to be
pestulent and seditions fellows, and mainteyners of fortes. Acts 24. 5.
Heretics. Acts 24. 14. (...) persons. Ierem. 15. 10. troublers often estate.
1. Kings 18. 17. 2 By imprisoning them. Ierem 20. 2. and threatening them with
death except they cease Exodus 10. 28. 2. Chron. 25. 16. Iere. 11. 21. yea many
times slaying some of them to (...) other from following the work of the Lord.
3 By causing their friends to forsake them. Tit. 4. 10. 16. Al these things
being promoters of the ministers blessedness. Mat. 5. ought to make them more
bold and forward in the work. Acts 9. 21. Acts 13. 45. 46. Philip. 1. 14.
knowing that the Lord will assist them. Tit. 4. 17.

3 The people whom he seeks to hinder also 1 By vpbrayding them with lack of
learning and knowledge. John 7. 40. 2 By causing tyrants to oppress them by
all vngodlymenes. Exodus 5. 6. 7. 8. 3 By sending out false teachers to withdraw
them. Against all which the people must arm themselves with knowledge and
patience, not forsaking the work of the Lord for any thing.


7 The sole^nitie and manner of receiving this reformation, (after the
hindrances thereof overcome) whereof we are to know, 1 The points and several
degrees of this solemnity, which are 1 A gathering together of all the states
of that place where the reformation is to be made. 2. Kings 23. 1. 2. Nehe. 8.
1. 2 A faithful laying open of the word by preaching in the cares of them all,
that they may see where reformation wants. 2. Chron. 34. ^0. Nehem. 8. 4. 8.
3 (...) prayer, with praising of God for his godnes in (...) them a sight of
their wants, and a way to reform them, with humble confession of their former
rebellions, disobediences, and backslidings. Nehem. 8. 6. to the end. 4 A
solemn covenant to be made with God by the whole state. 2. Kings 11. 17. 2 Chronicles. 15. 14. 15. In which covenant they promise hence forward to forsake all
their own ways and intentions, and to cleave to the commandments of God alone.
Unto this promise was adjoined an oath, and a curse or desire of vengeance to
come upon themselves, if they forsake the ways of the Lord for any other 2.
Kings 11. 17. Nehem. 10, 29.
2 The reasons why such manner of receiving this reformation is needful, which
are, 1 Because in a public deformation of the Church the covenant of our
peace is generally broken: wherefore it behooves us in returning and reforming
our selves, to renew the same covenant, as generally, and that in as solemn
manner as may be, seeing we are to deal, not with earth and ashes, but with the
God of infinite majesty, with whom to deal in light and dissolute manner,
especially in such a work, were great sin. 2 Because of the commandment of
the Lord, who in the public rebellion of Prince and people, charge them
which are in authority with that people, not only to receive instruction, to
rejoice before the Lord in trembling, etc. but moreover requires of them and
theirs, a solemn covenant, and the outward testimony of it, if they will
avoid the anger of God. Psalm 2.

8 The fruits and blessings which follow the receuers and workers of this
reformation. the Lord alwais gives a reward unto it 2. Chron. 15. 7. Forhe 1
Hears the voice of such, and their prayer comes up into hearin, to his holy
habitation. 2. Chron. 30. 27. 2 Forgeueth their former transgressions, and
though they were is red as crimsen, or scarlet, he makes them as white as snow
or wool. Esaias. 1. 18. 19. 3 Causes them to dwell in their own land, and not
to remove. Ierem. 4. 1. 7. 3. 4 Makes them to eat the good of the land. Esaias
1. 19. 62. 89. yea he opens the windows of heaven, and powers down upon
them the blessings of the earth in abundance. Malach. 3. 10. 5 Gives them
rest and quietness from their enemies. 2. Kings 11. 20. 2. Chron. 14. 5. 15. 15.
19. 20. 30. Esaias 31. 7. 8. 9. 6 Gives them strange victories, and mighty great
spoils of their enemies. 2. Chron. 14. 12 15. 15. 2. 20. 14. 23. 7 Makes them
to rule over many nations, and suffers not other to reign over the^. Deu.
15. 6. 8 Makes at things to prosper that they take in hand. 2. Kings 18. 7. 9
Gives to that Prince honor and riches in abundance, establishing the kingdom
in his hand 2. Chron. 17. 5. These and infinite blessings follow this
Reformation, wherefore they that wilfully withstand it evidently declare, that
they seek not the wealth, peace, plenty, godly pre-eminence, and flourishing
estate of their Prince and Country.
