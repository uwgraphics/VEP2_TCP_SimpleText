Rainold uuisshith, al health.
THE strong obligation uuherein, throu your special humanite, y find miself
right straightli obligid and bound, uuil in no uuise suffer forgetfulness of the
infinite benefits daili receauid at your hands in to mi mindful mind to make
eni unlauful entree. But continualli calling on, and setting before mine
inuuard eyes, on the one side, the uuaighti burden of bound dueti, on thouther,
the feoble correspondencie of mi small pour, engendrith in mi fantasi so
perplex and douteful deliberation, that co^paring the remissnes of mi slender
pour, uuith the excess of your singular merits, y can conceive but small hope
uuith so litil force, ever to discarge me of so great and grave a bond.
Notuuithstanding, uuilling in this behalf to ensue the example of honest
dettars, as ye, I am certain, do of ge^til Creditors, uuhereas y am not able at
one payment, to aquite the total sum of mi due det, if as pour, time, place,
and occation do give, y declare mi self, in that y may, sumuuhat touuards, and
readili uuilling, y dout not but your uuont curtesi uuil accept dilligent
endeuar, in place of a mean contentation. Vuhereas a feu months passid, ye
bought, only oppon mi commendation, a certain portion of the Oil, surnamid
Imperial, thereoppon requiring me to uurite you a short memori of the most
notable qualitees thereof, so soon as convenient leasar uuold suffer me,
parteli to perfurm mi promise to the inuentor of the said Oil longsith made,
but cheifli glad to embrace this occation, uuherebi y might seem to have
found sum matter, therein to shou the inclination of mi heart touuards the
accomplissheme^t of eni your uertuous desires, y fourthuuith took in hand to
compile, as ye see, this simple and rude treatise. The uuhiche, albeit it shall
manifestli appear far and uuide disansuuerable, both to your expectation, mi
desire, and also the uuoorthines of the matter, yet y trust ye uuil have
respect rather to the prompt good uuil of one, uuhiche in eueri thing to his
utter, is much fainar to gratify, then hable, to satisfy such his rare and
approuid frind. And in your so doing, ye shall increase in me sprite and
courage, by litil and litil, to excogitate hereaffter sum matter more
peradventure aggreable both to your appetite, and also mi fantasi. In the
mean uuhile, fare ye most harteli uuel. From Venice the first of March.

HONOR, says the good old proverb, nourisshith art: which saie^g of no less
uerite, then antiquite, if in our aege as in times ancient were remembrid and
regardid, no doubt but, the actiuite of men's wits at this present being no
less liueli, and forward then, the same of them in times passid, there would be
brought forth in these our days, as great effects of witty ingene, as have been from time to time from our ancient predicessars successiueli hitherto
receauid: who has so litill wordli experience that loking abroad seith not
with his eyes, withi these feu years, in all kind of arts and sciences such an
increase, yea perfection engendrid and upsprung, that almost it seamith there
can be no addition made to that the late wits of men have contriuid, inuentid,
and throuhli furnisshid? So that the fine industry and sharp wittines of men
in those latter days in all manner of knouledge, and experie^ces, have so far
and earnestli trauelid, and each his science so renuid, and pullisshid, that
the excellent effects and inventions, of these feu years, may be co^parid, and
estemid equivalent with the inue^tions of mani hundrith years before. Examples
hereof be so mani and plentitul, that were it to mi present purpose, y might
therewith furnisshe forth a great uolume. But as there be diverse, whom the
sight and fruition of fair fruicts do much delight and rejoice, so be there
well few, whom the care to set, or chearesshe the plats wherefro such fruits
might be lookid for, doith enithing touch, whereby it cummith to pass, that
mani of whom outherwise might be hoopid great abundance of excellent fruits
and uertuous inventions, eather for lack of sufficient suckor, as the ueri
humor of there tree, they can not increase, ne til due season nourishe there
fruit, but are constraignid to suffer them perisshe in the blossom, or if
there good adventure be, to attaigne unto the perfection of fruit, the same,
with the blasts of envy is so windshaken, that the tree of his fruit litil
praise and less proffet enioieth. That foul uice of ingratitude, right mani
apt and hable wits, from the atcheauing and entreprise of mani wurthie
matters, doith daili, no doubt, withold and greateli discourage, having over
much regard and respect, toward the uilite of that common reigning deuillisshe
uice. But in there so doing, as peradventure they may be comme^did for wise,
circumspect, and maintaignars of thereoune tranquillite and quietness, so yet
such private prudendencie is open injury and enimite to the commonwealth of
mankind and al posterite. If our ancients would have been abasshid, or
witholden from well doing, or writing, for eni such respects, reigning in there
dais as much ingratitude as nou in ours, we should have found ourself at this
time, in so profound darcknes and ignorancie of al uerite, that litill should be
the difference betuuene us and bruit beests.

Treu it is, that to the said incommodite of Envy be subiectid, in manner with
out exception, al such, who with there pen, pain themself to publisshe eni
kind of matter, nameli being annexid with sum novelty or rarenes. For anon as
in writing aman have his concepts once dischargid, and set at large, full mani
Judges, and of as uariable senses and opinions doith that pout writing
furthuuith acquire; Sum will improve it because nothing can like them but there
oune: Sum, be cause they not well understand the matter: Outher, to seem
therebi the wisar and more skillful: But he that is so tender over his name
that to shun and avoid the nipps of girning Envy, will abstaign and forbear to
puttfurth eni such tale^t, whereuuith the geuer of al goodness doith endue him,
take he head, leest whilst he seakith by that means to seem wordli wise, he
becum ungodli wickid: For somuche as it ought to be persuuadid to al unfainid
Christians, no man to be wise, to be cunning, mighty, ritche, of eni outher
gifft at gods hand to have receauid, for his oune oneli peculiar advantage,
glory, promotion, wealth, or pleasir, but thereuuithal to the utilite,
commodite, and benefit of al me^, in that may lie in him: And where as there be
mani and mani things, wereof the brittel and feoble nature of mankind has
daili necessite, and indigence, as well to the saffe maintaining and upholding
of his health and well fare, as also to the repairing and restoring of the same
being enithing decayed or emperisshid, who so can devise or invent eni manner of
thing whereby man may perceauer, and the better continue in good health, or
fallen therefro, the sonar and moore effectuousli recover the same: Such
inuentor and deuisar in mi opinion, not only meritith praise and commendation
of al them that wourtheli be co^prehendid under the name of man, but also in
conscience is straightli bound, to publisshe it so largeli, that the utilite
thereof may be extendid and spread over al men: For therefore, no doubt doith
god enspire diverse men with sundri knouledge, that each with outher frindeli
communicating his receauid talent, one therebi should find himself the nearar
bound and beholding to the outher.

So that by such unpartial distribution of his manifold graces, god has throu
his divine pollici, in a certain amite, and leege, meruelousli unitid and knit
all this wide wordle to gether: Were it not, that one man, one Cite, one
Nation, had neade of an outhers co^moditees, wisdom, counceil, help, serueis,
soukar, riches, uerili one would contemn and neglect an outher wurs then
strange dogs together.

Considerid then, that gods bounty doith thus gather and bind us in one, throu
his indifferent liberalise, who that enuieth, dispraisith, detractith an
outhers gifft, malignith, despicith, reprouith, and doith open contumeli even
to god the geuer thereof. Nether forcith it housmal in appearance such qualite
do seame: forsomuche as al and sum, the less with the moore, at his hands
ought to be taken with like tha^ckfullnes: nether is eni thing to be taken as
litil or smaul, that from so plentiful an hand proceadith: But what should y
speak of the smalnes or greatenes of eni qualite, when all that co^sistith in
the acceptance of man's light head: We see daili certain arts and qualitees,
had in the top of al estimation, there Artificers embracid, honorid, and
enritchid, which notuuithstanding solitil proffite the co^mone welthe of men,
that much rather thereto they be mere pernicious and dammageable: wurthie, if
our Judgment, throu blind appetite were not wholi corruptid, to be forgotton,
unexersicid and utterli banisshid: whereas in the mean white mani innocentarts,
available toal men, necessari, godli, uertuous, eather lie altogether
neglectid, and unesteamid, not able to ministre unto there pour practisars a
scarce living, orels be ueri slenderli regardid and scantli lookid on: So that
as it is offt and trueli said, eueri thing as it is taken, and not as it is in
de de.

But as we see that great heaps be compilid of mani smaul handfulls, if eueri
man for this part, setting aside disdaign at outhers virtue, would contend in all
his life to contriue or invent one oneli feate in eni what soever science
conducible to mankind, it is easy to be understandid to what increase and
absolutenes within feu years al manner of sciences might attaigne: And to
approoche sumuuhat near to mi prete^did purpose, In the noble science of
Physic, as it can not be denied, but that the clarcks of times passid
professing the same, have uniuersalli in eueri part thereof, so earnestli and
fruitfulli trauelid, that great wunder, and theruuithal exceading pleaser it is
to behold the curiouse and ingeniouse industry of them. One descanting oppon a
another, to inuestigate and right out enithing mistaken or mistought by there
predicessors: to explicate and clear thigs obscureli and darkli by outher,
eather throu breuite, orels rudenes, entreatid of before: to Compose and devise
medicines of most efficacy against al manner of Maladies infesting the weak
bodi of man: briefli to stable and reduce that wurthie science, so near as the
debilite of man's brains could approoche, unto Such exactnes, that of a
divining and gessing nouledge it might becum a certain and unfallible science.
Euenso as well, it can not be trueli denied, but that in this our time god has
stearidup excellent uertuous wits which so straitli call to examination all the
doctrine and docume^ts lefft from the ancients, waieng, and so
aduisidlitrieng, the sincere from the contrary, that if they procead as they
have begun, it is like within feu years, that science will be so renuid,
refresshid, and purgid, that they which hitherto have boren all the bruit, and
have obtainid al autorite, will leese a great portion of there creadit, and be
reputid rather for good meaners, then perfeite true teachars.

This diligens not alone in the speculatiue parts of Physic is usid, but also
in the pradiue, daili being inuentid, more effectuous, more sicure, and more
expedite remedies against diverse tedious, dangerous, and hard curable diseases?
Hou mani fair Simples are nou in co^mone use, which to our forefathers were
utterli unknouuen and unseene: As Reubarb, Seen, Gassia sistula, Manna, Sugre,
Ambte, Musk, Ciuet, Camphire, Turbith, the herbs Angelica, imperialis, with a
nu^bre of outher simples of excellent graces and qualitees: which if they
lackid, the fairist flowers of Physicians garlants were gone withal: Again, by
the art of distillation, (unto the ancients utterli unknouuen) hou mani fair
waters, Baumes, oiles, and outher such things have there ben of late days
contriuid, which to the paurposes whereto they were inuentid be of such forse
and efficacy, sum against outuuard diseases and sum against the inuuard that
no outher Simple or co^post medicines, in times passid diuisid may be to them
in eni wise co^parid. For by the feate of destillation the purar parts and
strength being before biried or drounid in the gross materialnes of the herbs,
Roots, gums, seeds, wuds, fruittes or outher what soever simples be
artificialli diuidid, and extractid in such wise, that the water, Oil, or
liqeur, affter that sort throu expert handling sublimid and distillid, in
manifold wise surmountith the simple wherefro it is sublimid, whether ye regard
the more celerite in wurking, or else the greater efficacy in operation.

by extreme distillation deliuerid from al waterisshenes, resting only a pure

melting, the crassenes and grossenes of gluy humors: warming, and chasing parts
throu distemperancie of cold debilitate: with outher infinite propretees.

Here also, if y listid to be long, y might make mention of the oiles of
lignum Aloes, of Nutmeggs, of Cloves, Geniper, Sulphur, Eggs, and mani outher
things: Which as they be singular against innumerable infirmities, so be
they, and all that hitherto y have rehersid, far and wide surmountid in all
graces and excellencies, of an oil, not mani years since, The excellen cie of
Oil Imperial.
by a familiar frind of mine inuentid, namid for the wurthines thereof, Oil
imperial. To this oil, al outher natural or artificial that they be, unto this
dai contriuid or inuentid, be as far inferiors, as the coursenes of outher base
Mettalls to the purite and extreme finess of gold.

But according as is said before, as the manner of distillation of waters, and
oiles, is a neuu and late inue^tion, to the very ancient physicians, unheard
of and vnknouue^, so the making of this oil imperial, has been as well to the
Neuu as to the old hitherto vtterli, so far as y can yet learn, vnknouuen,
outher then to mi said frind: Who, abought five years past, affter long
labor, constant diligence, and his no small charges employed i^ that behalf,
hauig at length brought it to pass: for the accustumid familiarite betuuene us,
geuig me a certain portion thereof, requirid, that y would according to mi
simple skill in physic, sumuuhat enstruct him whereto it might appear to be
most co^ducible, and what by reason y could judge the chief qualitees thereof
should be.

When y had well and aduisedli considerid the singular grace of the same, and
receauid sufficient information of the particulars, whereof it was composid, y
gessid anon, that it could not be, but that special and notable effects against
a wordle of diseases, therebi dueli vsid, should to mankind en sue: Wherefore
according to his request, so far as Art and reason had tought me, in writing y
declarid, what commoditees were most likeli to be lokid for, by it: And against
what diseases it seamid to be most available: Notuuithsta^ding forsomuche as
to judge the virtue of eni medicine only by art and reason, without a
confirmation engendrid by experience, is not aluuai sure, ne void of parel: I
cou^selid him not to be over bold, until such time that by leaser, as sundry
occations should offer themself, reason by practice were establisshid.

Since which time in dead, both he and outher for there parts, and y for
mine, not only in Ingland, but also in diverse outher quartars beyand the seas
having made sufficient prouffs, of the vndoutid good qualites whereuuith
aboundantli it is enduid And besides that, being nueli again by the said
inuentor of this divine oil, sollisitatid, with mi rudenes, to publisshe unto
the wordle such success, and veritable experience, as from time to time has been found, and tried by practice to be faithfulli true: y tho ught mi small
labor and pains to be employed herein, to the satisfaction of mi frinds
honest: demand, and the undoubted vtilite which might succeed to al them,
that driven throu importunite of such like diseases, be co^straignid to seake
for speadie and assurid reamedie, should not deserve eni discommendation, or
envious reproff of the Maleuolent, but rather the favorable acceptance of
upright and honest judgments.

Plainly yet confessing, that in mi self y can not find so exact and
sufficient hablenes, so liueli to express the valeur of this excellent oil,
as the wurthines thereof would require, and mimind desire? Only y may, and will
auaunt mi self herein to use such sin cerire and singlenes of verite, that y
trust none shall have eni just occation to accuse me of vanite, or eni private
affection vsid in this behalf: as to have extollid the dignite of the said
oil, eni thig above the merits, or above that, the effect thereof, being,
aright vsid; may accordingli approve and confirm: And albeit the singular
qualitees of it be greater, then may in feu wurdes be comprehe^did and
setfurth, yet minentent is not thereof to sai all that may be said or written,
but only by exemplifieng of sum portion of his infinite virtues, to open the
gate, whereby the skilful and lernid, by the feu experiences here rehersid may
enter by them sellf into a brodar camp of farther knouledge.

To thend also, that the verisimilitude of all that shall be said thereof may to
the lernid the moore cleareli ap pear, here will y trueli rehearse the sum of
the particular ingredience which to the composition of this oil do co^curre:
without yet opening all the circumstance vsid abought the making of it, lest
the author thereof should, not without a cause claim him self iniuried and
wrongid therebi. The simples uuhereof Oil Imperial is made.


These be the simples. First, Cloves Mace, Nutmeggs, the roots of Setwale, of
Angelica, Imperialis, Enula ca^pana, Gentiana, and Petasites; the rinds and
kernels of Citrons, Oranges, and Lemmons: the wuds, of lignum Aloes, lignum
uitae, and lignum Asphalathi: these herbs dried, Origanum Cretense, Diptamus
Creticus: Scordion Cretense: Squinantum: folium Indu^: Roosemary: Saueri:
Mariorame: Herb Maudlene: the seeds of Amomum, Ameos, Daucus, Basel, Semen
Santonicum: Coriander, and Carui.

Of al these in acertain proportion mixid and temperid together, by long
digestion, and at length with a gentil distillatio^ is creatid this caelestial
oil, without adding or adioining thereto eniouther oil or liqeur whatsoever,
as y can well testify having more then once seen the making thereof: Pondering
then well the rehersid ingredience as y have them faithfulli reportid, he that
would aufft dout whether is were of a special efficacy, should declare mutche
his oune simplicite and ignorance in the nature of things: For whereas they be
al and each seueralli of notable great virtue, being here conioinid, vnitid,
and commixid together, and then of the^ al so incorporatid, the foresaid oil
by singular ingene, as the liffe, perfection, sprite, quintessence and diuinar
part, extract and drauuen fourth, it must necessarili comprehend in it self the
whole sum of the particular virtues natural to al and each such simples: and
that in more perfection and exact wise then they were before in the simples
self: nooutheruuise then Aqua uite skilfulli distillid, much surpassith the
wine werefrom it is destillid, both in actiuite, simplicite, purite,
penetration, speadi operation and diverse outher wise.

So that as experience witnessith, the same once deuidid from the wine, as the
lif and soul there of, the rest remaining in the bottom of the stillatorie,
is as a boodi souls and spriteles, having no taste ne relless, but al unsavory
and waterisshe, therein resting no moore propriete of wine: Euenso the said
oil, as the very heart blud and sprite, of these rehersid simples, obtainith in
it the effects, and natural propretees of them al, in far more excellency,
the^ the uery self simples had them: And that because there qualitees,
ouermatchid, hid and allaid, with the gross material substance, and
corpulencie, can not so cleareli declare there force, nor so exquisiteli
excersice there divine operations, as being by art sequestrate, diuidid, and
deliuerid of al materialnes. Nether here preuailith the cauillatio^ of sum,
which mouid eather of envy, or ignorancie, or else boothe, would prove that
nether this oil ne eni outher, to be so effectuous as the very material
composition of the simples from the which they be extractid, by the examples
of diverse distillid waters: of whom sum there herbs being of bitter qualite,
the water participatith nothing of that taste, but al bitterness lefft with the
herb, the water destillith rather suueete: Vuherebi it may seame evident that
such water leasing the apparent sensible qualitees, of the herb, should also
thereuuithal want the propreties due to such qualitees: as is to be seen in
the water of wurmwud, and the most part of al outher herbs.

Hereto y ansuuere that this defect in waters, folouuith much, throu the
common indiscreet and rasshe distilling of them: whereas, were they with more
leasar and sofft tempering of the fire curiouseli ha^dlid, they should retaigne
by agreate deal better, the gust and taste of there herbs, as diverse wary
practisars do know: But housoeuer it cum to pass in waters, in oiles is an
nouthar reason: forsomuche as the oil of eueri thing is far more intrinsical
and connatural to the substance thereof: Engendrid by a farther and more exact
labor and industry of nature, in tempering, mixing, intermingling, and
circulating the materials or elements together with so mutual and frindli
action and passion, the one within th'outher, thereto aiding the moderation of
internal and external heat as digestar, co^coctar, and ripar of al, that being
thus once, by these means the contrariete and ennimite of the four Elements
conciliate, and accordid together, they never affter by eni mean can be
seuerid a sundar again: So strait be they enlinckid the one within the outher,
that what violence so ever is done to them, eather go they to geather,
eatherels valientli remaigne together.

Oil then is the likeur most permanent and durable lest subject to corruption,
dissolution, dissipation: wherein nature lockith and vpclosith al her iuels; In
things animate, as man and outher living beasts, it is the treasor of there
lift, wherewith there natural heater, is fed, nourisshid and maintaignid: In
plants and outher vegitables it barith such autorite, that where it most
Aboundith, there is that Plant most liueli, continuith longest, withstandith
best al injuries of weather, remaignith longar fresshe and greane: as the Baie
tree, the Box, the vine, the olife tree, the herb Aloe, Rosemarie, and mani moo.

Vuhereas outher being less oilie or gummi, having a moore fluy, and waterisshe
composition, soon fade, and wither a way, the weakness of the water for eueri
small distemperancie of weather forsaking the substance wherein it was.

Being then manifest, that the oili part of each thing, is it, wherein the
sprites, life, and chief virtue of the same be conseruid and most resident; it
is nothing tobe doutid but he which out of eni plant can the same saffeli
without ouermuche violencie of fire extract, shall forth with enioie a liqeure
much more medicinable against al diseases, then the plant self: By reason
that, besides it has the same qualitees, it has them in a moore simplicite
and purite: Vuhat differrence is betuuene qualitees annexid with tenuite,
thinnes, or subtilite of substance, and the same matchid with crassenes of
substance, unto Physicians it is not vnknouen: Yet not al tenuite, thinnes, or
subtilite of substance wurkith with like efficacy in the body of man: Aqua
vite, of whom we spoke before, brought by offt reiteration of distillation to
such extreme subtilie, that no waterie part remaign therein, so that asponeful
or sausarfull thereof being set a fire, it co^sumith hooli in to flame,
without leuing eni manner of humor or water behind: Thus handlid, y sai, it is
the most dainty, thin, fine, and simple liqeur that by man's wit can be
inue^tid: Not with standing, eni utter part of man's body being, for sum cause
bathid or fomentid thereuuith, skantli it enter the poores of the skin, but
very swiftteli throu the small heat of the skin it smookith and dries away
agein, leuing small empressio^ or efficacy behind it: Likeuuise against eni
cold disease, or surfetts being drunck, what it cando, it doith soodenli and
out of hand, warming the stomach, running every where abroad into the veins,
multiplieng for a time and conforting the debilitate sprites of the body: but
such his operation right soon ceassith and his pour vanisshith auuai anon.

the efficacy of oil Imperial.
This present oil imperial being on eni external part e^nointid remaingnith not
without oppo^ the face of the skin, ne by the heat thereof smokith or
consumith away, but speadeliper cith, and enterith the poores, in manner
without rubbing thereof on the skin: warming, opening, dilating the same part,
and being thereunder eni opilation, or collection of knotti cold humors, the
same it vndoith, diuidith, meltith, dissoluith, and vtterli disparsith: making
way, and so preparing the matter, that nature, having in her eni force may
lightli discharge herself in expelling that, which before throu grossenes,
withstode al her pour and endeavor: Again, the same oil receauid by eni
means within fourth, warmith the stomach, dissoluith ventosite, openith
opilatio^s, or stoppings engendrid of cold humors; It passith also, albeit not
so hasteli as aqua uite, into the veins, dilating it self ueriuuhere; carried
to the raigns or kidnees, prouokith urine breakith the, stoone: Mounting or
descending, in the outher veins of the boodie, for the oili part sake it is
the more familiarli receauid; throu qualitees annexid with subtilite and
extreme tenuite, dissoluing and rarifieng cold and vndigestid humors there
found* whereby they be made the aptar, eather to be ouercum and digestid, orels
utterli by swet, and outher means of Expulsio^ to be thrust out of the boodi:
Conuaied to the heart, it fortifieth and confortith the same, increasing the
natural vigeur and pour thereof: whereby it may the better withstand the
assalts, and invasions of eni uenemous or pestelent uapours, by eni occations
creaping thereto.

These and infinite outher effects it wurkith in the body of man, as sumuuhat
more particularli shall be said hereaffter, and that not slightli of passingli
as aqua uite, which doith but as it were look into the body, and sodenli
bestoing it self abroode, takith his leave again, not able throu the extreme
simplicite of his substance, to abide eni while the heat of the boodie, but of
the same ueri soon is consumid and resoluid: but if it be receauid with ale or
wine it endurith longar in the bodi, and wurkith moore sadli: The deades and
operations of oil Imperial be infiniteli more constant, and stable: for by
reason of his oilines, it has his substance better compact, and fixid to
gither, and threrefore abidith, and endurith longar while, withstanding the
greadines of the boodeli heat, fortifieng and increasing the same, becumming
thereto an aid and soueraign suckar, toward the vanquesshing, expulsion, and
subduing of eni noisome and rebel humors; and the retempering of eni distemperid
part.

And albeit that being, as it is, oil, and therefore sum what of substance
more crass, it might seame, by somuche, to be less apt with such celerite to
be distributid into the veins, as Aqua vite, which is, as it were, nothing
else but firi aier concretid into the similitude of water; yet in this oil the
four elements, yea the grossest of them, by the benefit of nature be so
subtiliatid, raffinid, and depurid, that trueli never hitherto eni oil has been, or, in mi opinion, by the wurke of nature ca^ be, more simple, subtle and
Aierial, Vvherebi very speadeli it exersisith his propreties, and soon
bestouuith it self abroode. Farther whereas Odor and good savor, concurrant
with good qualitees is no small commendation in eni manner of Medicine or meat
applicable to the use of man's boodie, making the same the more grate, and
Amiable unto the receauar, and signifieng sum special grace of mixtion to the
Medicine by celestial favor and influenceinstinctid; no outher wise then in
Music, certain concords and consonancies concurring together, engender above
outher, a marvelous suueatenes of armonie and heauenli melody, rauisshing the
hearars in wunderful delight and reioise: albeit that no man readili can
allege sufficient reason wherefore such concord more then outher, should be
agreeable and pleasant to the ear of man: But whether the grace of good savor,
be to be ascribid unto sum particular and notable proportion and consonancie of
the four Elements, or else to sum Quintessential proprete, and divine influxe,
it would breed a long prossess to discuss: Only this of oil Imperial may
beaffirmid, that among the oiles al, in good and uertuous odor none may be
co^parid to it: a plain testimoni that therein be hid and harberid sprites of
no smaul excellentie.

So that whereas these mani years there has been among curious wits, great
contrauersie and question, of the high medicine, namid for his excellent
efficacy, in praeseruing and prolonging the life of man, Elixir vitae;
althings indifferentli waied, and so comparid together, that laud and
praeheminencie, may much more iustli be attribute unto this rare et wurthie
oil, then unto such oiles, waters, Auru^ potabile, and outher fancies, by
diverse alledgid, proposid, and far above there merits exaltid and magnified:
Notwithstanding to avoid al fantastical vanite, y say, the ueri true Elixir
vitae, maintaignar and prorogar of the same, is the holsom habit, state,
compositi^on, or complexion of the boodi, upholden and maintaignid with the
temperancie of convenient diete; eaquabilite of natural heat, stearid up and
quickened throu necessary and moderate exersice: And with excheuing the exces
of al passions or affections of the mind: ln whom these propreties be found,
it may be well said, the same to have the veritrade, mean, and elixir of long
and helthsum liff.

But forsomuche as the blind bewitchid will of man, has renouncid the just
governance of reason, and yeldid it self as captif to the tyrannical
jurisdiction of vnbridlid sensual and appetites, it folowith, that feu or none
there be, al thouh there state or complexions be naturalli neuerso firmed and
good, but that throu execssiue misuse of bodili actions and appetites, it is
alterid, peruertid, and corruptid: The natural heat, gouernar, framer,
deuisar, director, and cause general of al operations in the body, eather by
superfluite oppressid, scarcite deminisshid or euel qualite into distemperancie
alterid: Vuereas then, all the comfort strength, motion, sense, all the
operations, and actions of the boodie (being besidesfurth with his apt and due
members or instruments furnisshid) consistith and dependith chiefeli oppo^ the
safe and temperate maintaining of the natural heat includid vniuersalli in all
and eueri part of the bodi; by whose presence each part is hablid to attract
his convenient nutriment, and the same to digest and assemble to it self, the
superfluitees not agreeable or necessari to refuce, and by convenient means to
expel; by whose moderation also, the vapors or sprites of life, of sense, of
motion, be engendrid conseruid and made apt to Animate and steer up the
instruments of the boodie, each to the execution of his deputid office: yff it
hap therefore, that the same eather by over, or under, in quantite or qualite,
becum oppressid, or decaid, that medicine which best, withmost expedition, and
securite, can help to restoore, repair, and set on foot again the lapse or
fall of the said natural heat, aiding and coadiuting it to the uanquesshing and
repulsing of al aduersrie causes, such Medicine may, and that not vnwurtheli
be accountid an Elixir, or prorogar of humain life.

This our Oil, iustli callid imperial, in this case is so mighti and ualiant,
in helping and Farthering natural hear, to the clearing and vnstopping of al
obstructions and stuffing of eni part in the body, in rarifieng the densite or
cloosenes engendrid eni where, by what occation so ever it be, in increasing
heat decaid, that his operation surmountith al praise and commendation: and
therefore may wurtheli be holden and estemid for The very Elixir of liff: The
which when ye when ye be disposid to use against eni disease, Oil Imperial
may be ^amid the E^ixir of life.
eather withinfurth, or withoutefurth, not mindid to use the same alone, if ye
mix it with sum outher such simples or composts as be aggreable to that
disease, infiniteli shall the virtue of that simples or co^posts, by the
presence of this oil, be enhaunsid and encreasid, with much moore speade and
efficacy perfourming there lookidfor effects.

And to thend that with the superfluite of mani words the readar, be not
fastidiat and over cloied, or there desire to be resoluid of the final and
uttar virtues of the said offt me^cionid oil, eni longar holden in suspense, y
will hereaffter brieffli, and as it were with mi fingar superficialli point unto
certain particular diseases, against the which y, and outher, have offte^
found it singularli souueraign: not partialli describi^g eueri small
circumstance to be vsid therein: for that would becu^ matter of a greatar
uolume: and besides that argue in me a superstisious arrogancy, in that it
might seem y had so slendar an opinion of outher men's judgments, to thinck
that vnleese y declarid peese by peese eueri particle, they should be to seek,
hou to there pourposes at eni time to apply the same: Iknou tho y should minse
the matter never so small, or enlarge it so much as might be, yet feu bether
that without the advice of sum discreate and lernid physician, would in eni
Important disease entremedle therewith: Not that this Oil of it self, is litil
or moore dangerous, but for this reason that the most innocent medicine in the
wordle, yea our familiar meat, and drinck, vsid out of convenient season, or
where it were better forboren, or affter sum inordinate sort, may and daili do,
bread displeasirs:

To the expert then, that which before y have al ready in this matter said,
is sufficient: Not withstanding for there sake which have not that discourse
nor exact judgment of the sequel and consequencie of things, y wila litil
broodar extend mi tale, and specify a certain of the most notable diseases
whereto this oil is found effectuous: Firsst begin at the head as capitain
general and ouersear of all the rest of the boodi.

In the head of man, dis^ head.
from the substance, and the cauls of the brain, all the Synues of the bodi he
engendrid, and from thense by certain means, diriuied and sent forth unto al
outher parts of the bodi; Throu the which Sinue, out of the said brains, as
original and fontain, be distribute and disparsid the spirits and vapors of
sense and Moving: without whose presence, no membre nor portion of the bodi can
once eather move or feel; so that whereas the mouth and head spring of the
synues is in the head, and the sprites opon the subtilar part of the blud
engendrid do make there, there first entrance in to the foresaid synues, throu
there capacite carried eueri else where: it happenith sumtime that, gross, and
uiscous superfluous humors, engendrid, and amassid or heapid in the place, or
sum pestele^t, and venomous putrified humor assending from sum inferior part to
the topkastel of the head do obstruct or stopp, more or less, the said gates,
ports and entries of the synues: Vuhereby doith ensue, that the sprits being
prohibitid there accustumid course, the sense of fealing and motion of the
bodi, the one alone, or the outher, or bo the for a time is diminisshid or
decayed.

he Apoplecia.
If the Opilation and stopping be vttar and exact, cumming of cold crass humors,
it engendrith the dangerous disease callid the Apoplexia: wherein al bodili
sense and motion be so brought a sleep, and failid, that offt times the
patient, xxiiii. hours or more, lies so senseles that it appearith the same
of at liffe to be wholi destitute.

The falling sickness also proceadith like causes; the falling sickness.
but the oppilation causing that disease is not so exact and extreme; wherefore
they that fall, be not vtterli private of sense and motion: For we see them
beating there heds and bodi; And that beating of there head, no dout is done by
the instinct of nature: By reason that whereas the passage of the sprites of
Motion, is not quite stopped up, but only that by the access of such corrupt
humor, there course is interruptid, and they therebi, as it were stranglid,
nature which alwais is industrious to save herself in her due being, mouith
the patient to bestere himself: but espetialli to steer the part offe^did or
greauid; therebi the better and sonar to deliver it self from encoumbrance of
the wickid humor occatio^ of such disturbance: as the like manner she uses in
vometing: at what time naturalli the stomach is prouokid to discharge it self
from noisum humors occupieng that place: And also in the cough the weasand
being ticklid, or irritate by sum humors desce^ding thereto, which, were not
the present resistance of that place, would forcebli enter in to the windpipe,
to the paril of strangling the party.

Item in the Head happenith an outher tedious disease callid the Paulsy. Vuhiche
co^mo^li, proceadith of causes not unlike the foresaid: houbeit not so vehement
ne dangerous. And most times ensuith rather of distemperantie and debilite of
the instruments of moving, which be the synues, then of eni abundance, or
evil qualite or quantite of humors oppilating the mouths of the said synues.

Farther, ^ng
in the Head do reign the diseases callid, Caros.i. the sleaping sickness: And
Vertigo, that is, the Turnsicknes, or swiming of the head: with Catalepsis,
whihe signifies astounnidnes, or Amasidnes: with diverse outher: Al which,
with the rest what soever they be, have sum time there causes only in the head,
and sum times, or rather most, take there original of the stomach.

For, the stomach in comparison of the head, may be resemblid to the pan or
bottom of a stillatorie; and the Head, to the deck or lembick of the
stillatori: so that, what soever humors or outher matter is found in the
stomach, the same throu the natural heat of that place resoluid in to reekes,
fumes, or vapors, and the said vapors stieng from thens and breathing up in
the head, as they be affectid and disposid in them self, so do they affect and
dispose the head and his parts: If then such vapors be stinking, corrupt,
euilsauorid, resoluid from sum putrified and rotton humors, thereopo^, be
engendrid in the Head, other the Turnsicknes, the Palsy, the falling sickness,
or else sum outher notable grief: as Apostumations in sundry regions of the
head: which when they be ripid and broken, send forth the matter by the ears,
or the noose, or the roof of the mouth, or eyes, or outhewise as nature
findith most accommodate place and region to thrust forth such matter: offt
times also it engendrith stinking and rotten teathe and bretthe, with
discoulorid eyes, and duskid eye sight: as also trooblid wits and evil memori.

Against al these inconueniens; oil imperial takin inward, beit alone or
co^ioignid with outher co^uenable things (as anon shall be said) shouith
exceeding efficacy: throu his wholesome and aromatical odor, with correspondent
qualities, co^forting the stomach, drie^g up, and sincering alputrifactio^: the
virtue whereof mounting into the head, there cuttith, deuidith, and disparsith
al crassnes and tenacite of humors, attenuating matters congeilid and cludderid
together: opening al opilations, chieff causars of the apoplex, palsy, falling
sickness, sleapi^g sickness, Astunnidnes, swiming, ringing, singing, and piping
in the ears; dispatchith old aches be they i^ the forepart or hinder part of
the head, or else in the sides of the head, callid Migremes: it makith the brethe
sweet: it co^firmith the Memoratiue part, dullid by reason of cold, or
outherwise evil disposid humors: It fortifieth the vigeur and pour of the
synues: Encreasith also the liuelines and agilite of the sprites both of
motion and sense: clarifieth the eyesight, quickenith the sense of odor or
savor: and likewise the sense of hearing: Stearith up the viuacite and present
readiness of wit and comprehention or understanding.

a precious me dicine made uuith oil imperial.
The use of the said oil in these cases, accompanied with outher simples
having respect to such diseases, as y have offt vsid, is in this wise: Take of
the flowers of rosemarie, sage, betoni, ysope, Gelifloures, primroses,
Couslips, damask roses, of each of these flowers the weight of.vi. pe^s: of
the fresshist leaves of Mariorame, of winter sauerie, Terragon, pennirial, and
sweet garden Mints: of each the weight of.iiii. pens: of the seades of Peoni,
of Basil, of sweet Fenil, of Anise, of each the weight of.iiii. pens: of fine
Cinamome, nutmeggs, and Mace, of each the waigth of.v. pens: And whereas all the foresaid flowers can not be had at one season: let each in his season be
gatherid, and that in a fair dry morning, affter the sun have one half or one
hole hour, shone thereopon: then on a fair linen clotthe lai them abroad in
the aier, out of the sun to dry alitil, the space of vi. or.viii. hours:
which done, take the foremencionid weight of the^, and three times as much
white sugre, beaten first to powder: and in a stone mortar beat the flowers
and sugre together til they be well te^perid the one with the outher, conserve
wise: the which ye shall reserve in sum brood mouthid glass or galli stone
pott, until ye have al your flours in readiness: And as has been said of the
flours, so do likewise with the herbs in eueri point: As for the outher dry
droges, ye shall beat them in to powder, and after, in a stone mortar with the
conserve of the flours, and herbs, stamp them and mixed them perfetli in one,
adding thereto, drop after drop, the quantite of.ii. sponefuls of oil
Imperial, continualli steering, and stamping, til al be well incorporate
together: This precious Electuarie, not alone against the above rehersid
diseases, but also, al outher inward diseases is most mighti and present
remedi: And as the disease is greater or lessar, so is it to be vsid in more or
less quantite, and offtnar or seldomar times: Being the disease great, it is
to be taken two times the day: that is.iii. hours before diner, and.ii. hours
or more affter suppar, at each time the quantite or weight of ii. grootes:
eather alone, or else with sum destillid water, or sum good thin brotth; or if
the party be of complexion very cold, with sum maluesie, or romeni, or outher
good white wine: thus continuing the space of forty days: Presupposing that if
the quantite or qualite of the humors causars of such disease, do require it,
that the same by the advice of sum expert Physician should be purgid and
clensid, to thend the medicine may the better and with more success wurk: not
forgetting to use therewithal, conformable and accommodate diete.

hou oil imperial is to be taken alone.
But who that listith to receive it without being accompagnied with such, or
outher conserues, shall find it nothing the less virtuous in his operation; at
what time it is to be taken at the foresaid prescript seasons, one quartar of a
sponeful at once, with iiii. or.v. sponesulls of Muscatel, or outher sweet
wine, otherels with as much of the brotthe of mutton, vele, or chicken: Sum
dipp therein a morsel of bred, and so eat it: supping affter it, a doosen
sponefulls of thin brotthe: Outher take it with figgs, or with a litil
clarified honi, or fu^ syrup, sugre, or eni co^serue: as the conserve of
rooses, of borage, Bugloss, rosemarie, and such like: there be also that
rolling the powder of liquerise in this oil, make thereof pills, the which
they swallou whole: eueri man as his stomach can serve him best: Not that the
oil of it self is lothesum or tedious to be receauid, but forbecause therebe
mani of so tender stomachs, that the same will admit nothing ministrid in the
name of a medicine, unless it be couerid with sum outher more familiar thing:
Housoeuer ye deal with it, so it be conuaied in to the bodi it makith no
great matter: and that ye remembar to increase or diminisshe, the quantite of
it, proportionalli to the vehementie, or slacknes of the disease: As that the
smallist quantite be.v. or.vi. drops: The greatist half a sponeful at once, not
that in exceeding the said measure there were eni peril, but because the same
may seame sufficient for one time against eni never so strong and rebel disease.

Thus whether it be ministrid alone, otherels, according to the discreation of
the physician, matchid with outher agreeable medicines, it bringith forth such
effect, as of eni wurthie medicine may be lookidfor: And that not alone in cold
diseases but also in the hott: For, whereas co^mo^li there is no hot disease
but that it is engendrid by inclusion and emprisoning of sum humors, be they
hot or cold, in all the veins, or in sum cornar of the vains, bouwels, orouther
intrailes, or eni flesshie or muskli part of the bodi: where being coartid,
pent, and straightnid, they putrify smoulder, and kendel an unnatural fire or
heat, yea tho the humor before such inclusion were never so cold, no
outherwise then wette Hey or Strau, laid in a close house without vent, and
the said putrified humors as they putrify more and more, so wex they hotter
and hottar, by which heat again they resolve in to such reekes and fumes,
that the place wherein they be in stoppid and lodgid, becumming to straight for
them, they strive, and contend to getfurth: but if al issue be dinied them,
then such striffe, and contention, turnid into rage, and fury, fillith the
pour patie^t ofttimes so full of intolerable anguisshe and dolor, that death
were to be preferrid.

Therefore that, which can unstop, and set at large such humors, by consequent
curith the disease thereon ensuid: for such furious fiery humors, being once
enlargid, and set at there liberty, soon dispatche, disparce, and consume
the^ self: thereto helping the expulsive pour of nature (if she have not been
to much alreadi oppressid) inset in eueri membre, and part of the boodi, to
repel from themself things noisum: For this reason against al Intermitting
agues, as the Quotidian, the Tertia^, against al agues.
and the Quartai^ agues, this Imperial oil is much excellent: because that
the several humors, causes original of these foresaid Agues, throu putrefaction
chaungid and alterid from there natural state, remaign pen tup and incloosid in
sum spetial place, where they ca^ not breathe, eue^t them self, ne easeli get
forth. Vuerefore to unstop and enlarge al such opilations, one hour before ye
suspect the ague shall invade the patient, give him to drinck one quartar of a
sponesul of oil imperial, with xii. or.xv. sponefulls of posset ale, or wine,
or sum outher good thin brotthe, forthwith doing what may be done, to provoke
the party to swet before the fit of the Ague do enter: If ye list to use the
Electuari, whereof we wrote before, ye may as well: but in case, besides the
said drinck, ye ennoint all the ridge of the patients back, from the raigns up
wards unto between the shulders, with the oil of Camomel temperid with a litil
of this soueraign oil, the better shall the ague be preuentid, and the sonar
shall the patient swet: This ordar being kept.ii. or.iii. times, before the
assault of the fit, no doubt all the occation of such Ague, will be dischargid:
onless besidesfurth there be to great disordar in diete.

against the pestilence.
To preserve eni man from the infection of the pestilence, if he take each
day, or each outher dai, in the morning fasting, of the above writin
Electuari, or of this oil alone, one small quartar of a sponeful, with sum
such things as be reme^brid before, it shall be found singular in preserving:
But if eni be alreadi seasoni^d with the plage, then twice the dai, morning and
evening, with a quantite of barlei water, or sum outher thin brotthe or rather
with the mountnance of a walnut of good Thriacle, or Mithridatum, give the
infectid half a sponeful of this oil, incontinentli provoking him to swet: and
diet him besidesfurth, as appartainith:

against poisons and ueno^s
Also against poisons, stingings, or bitings of eni venomous beasts or mad
dogs, the said oil taken as before with Mithridatum, or theriacle
withstandith the venemosnes of such sting or bite, from approaching near or
inuading the heart or eni outher principal part: Is likewise convenient to be
ennointid oppon the place stung or bitt; or to be temperid with Emplastars
vsualli made for such purposes, whereby there virtue retractiue shall be made
dooble: Besides, that the subtilite of the oil entering such wund will alter
and effeblisshe the malice of the venime, that tho it do penetrate farther in
thebodi, yet accompanied and matchid with the said oil, it shall have no
pour to do eni viole^ci to the parts where it shall pass by.

for the suuoning.
For them that are much disposid to poue, or swound, if, affter eni sort they
list, it be efftsones vsid, it shall deliver them of that Infirmite: to them
that be swounid or faintid.v. or.vi. dropps thereof with a sponeful of white
wine or Muskatel pourid in to there mouth, there temples also, and there
nosestrels rubbid therewith, reuiuith and callith them again to them self.

against diseases of the spleen.
Therebe whose Spleen or Melt, is so obstruct and stopped with gross Mela^cholious
humors, that nether, according to the due office of that bouwel, it can by
attracting the Melancholi part, deliver the blud there of: nether yet expurge
it self from that it has alreadi conceauid, the passages both of entrance,
and issue being obstruct and stoptup. Vuerebi ensuith diverse grievous
dispositions of the bodi: for whereas the Melancholy humor, is the dross,
dreggs, and as it weere the lies, and terrestrial part of the blud; remaining
vndiuidid and vnsequestratid from the purar part of the same, it farith forth,
and passith eueriwhere, with the blud, troobling, darckning, obscuring the
clarite and brightness thereof: as the purite, and clearenes of wine is defacid,
and discolorid, and the good relless thereof destroyed, when the lies hanging
in the substance of it, trooble the same: nether can be by sum slyght, depurid
therefro, and the lies to his place, the bottom, returnid agein: They in whom
the blud affter this sort is with such felouship infectid, be inclinid much
to al Heaviness, pensifnes, without eni external cause: they feale the light of
there wits and sprites, obfuskat, and darcknid: they abhor and hate compani,
desirous of solitarines; be full of despair, weep, murne, by them self
causeles: be much suspicious, soon take unkindness and displeasirs, rejoice in
nothing, and weri of this lif, often desire death: al these, with mani mo tedius
passions, folou and molest the^, whose blud is assosiatid, with that sad, and
black humor the Melancholi: But to greatar danger, and perilous pain be they
subiectid, whose Melt, as has been said being obstructid, the black humor that
therein restith, at certain seasons swellith, puffith, and heauith up, like
sour leven or barme, in do we: or as vinegar, or strong water falling on the
earth, his since and liftith up it self in bubbles or bladders: throu the which
swelling and inflatio^, the bowel of the Spleen, wherein such sour Melancholi
humor is comprehendid, is by that occation distendid, and pufft up, more then
his natural: and therefore requirith more room or place then he was wunt, to
the injury and oppression of his neighbars: as pri^cipalli the Stomach and the
Midriff: whereopon offtimes during the time of such inflation, if it be
vehement, the patient leasith his speech: because the Midriff is shortenid or
interruptid of his due scope, or wunt course: and the stomach nameli the mouth
or entry thereof, molestid and straighnid by the swollen spleen, which lies
in manner over thwart the stomach: For, these parts be as chief, in enlarging or
witholding the speech: as in the Stomach may be seen by daili experience: if a
man swollou a pese of meet, bread, or outher thing, which not strait
enterith in to the capacite of the stomach: but restith and staieth at the
mouth of the stomach so long as the same there remainith, the party in no wise
shall be hable to speak one wurd: and that for diverse causes nedeles in this
place to be rehersid.

The said splenetic patients, not alone fail of there speech, but also
manitimes have there mouths drauwen on the one side, there eyes staaring, a
continual assai, and endeuer, to speak, if it would be; with very painful
retraction of the sinues; so that mani times i^mediateli ensuith death with
much anguisshe, to the great compassion of the beholdars: Against al these
incommodities, whether it be with inflation of the spleen, or only a continual
hardness, and swelling thereof, nothing can be excogitate more present reamedi,
then the daili use of this Oil affter such sort as has be^ before
prescribid: together with offt ennointing of the lefft side under the small
ribbs, with this effectuous oil: and by mixtion thereof, witheni such
ointment or plastar as ca^ be deuisid to that purpose.

against the colic or stitches.
There be feu, that at one time or outher have not felt the bisie dolor of the
colic; or the sharp stabbs and stitches in the breast, sides, or outherwhere,
distending, stretching, and as it were racking, tearing, and pulling a sundre
the gutts, the breast, or outher part where eni ventosite is so encloistrid and
pent, in that in no wise it can get forth: This Oil then, receauid by the
mouth affter eni sort it pleasith the patient, or the physician to ministre
it: conuaied also with a glistar into the gutts, or if neade be ennointid on
the belli, the side, the breast, the stomach, or eni outher place where such
ventosite is engendrid and includid, mightili dissoluith, disparsith, and
vanguesshith the same, and that in small time.

for the crudite of the stomach.
So that mani being encombrid with crudite, or raunes of the Stomach, and by
consequence with ventosite, offt belchings, and curling, murmuri^g or rumbling
in the gutts, by using once the day or once in.ii. days, half an hour before
diner.iii. or iiii. drops of this oil, more or less, according to the cause,
have recouuerid good digestion with concoction of al crudite.

Against the stone.
For the stone, be it in the Rains or in the bladdar, being receauid alone or
temperid with outher convenient things, and the rains withoutefurth ennointid
therewith alone, or alaid with the oil of rooses, or bittar almons, to the
physicians discreation: likewise if the stone be in the bladdar, thereof
conuaied into the bladdar, and the neck of the bladdar, or the shaare with it
curiousli enointid, it penetratith, and by penetration breakith, pouderith, and
crummith the stone, in such wise that no outher medicine can be found of the
like speadi efficacy toward that purpose.

for the green sickness.
Against the grene sickness in women, and the stopping or staieng of there natural
course, as also to dispose them the better to conception, whether it be
drunken, or with convenient means (as weme^ and phisitio^s do knou) co^uaied
to the priui places, it has been found alwais a thing of great aad readi
success.

Against impotentie to the wurks of generation, both in man and woman,
proceading eather by infrigidation of the parts generatif, or sum obstruction,
withstanding the due course of the sprites and vapors, mouers and steerers to
that act, this Imperial oil, therewith offt times being enointid the parts
generatifs, is ueri singular.

Against the flux of nature.
Take of Mastick, of the flowers of Pome granate, of Mirtil beries, of eathe
half an ounce: beat them to powder, and temper them with.vi. sponefulls of
this Oil, enclosing al together in a litil vial of glass, setting it a
sunning, ten or twelve dais; with this oil ennoint the neck of the bladdar,
which lies between the foundment and the yard, with also both the
genitories, eueri dai twice and therebi shall sease, be staid and stoppid, the
continual flux of nature, wherewith mani be much greauid and effeoblisshid.
