MIRACLE upon MIRACLE. Or A true Relation of the great Floods which happened in
Couentry, in Lynne, and other places, on the 16. and 17. days of April last
past, in this present year of our Lord God, 1607.



Printed at London for Nathanael-Fosbrook. and John Wright. 1607.

A true Relation of the great Floodes which happened in Couentry in the Countye
of Warwick. In Lynne in the County of Norfolk. In Stopworth in the County of
Chester, and in Sheppy, and other places in the County of Kent, all which
happened on the 16 and 17. days of April last past in this present year of
our Lord God. 1607.
WHen I enter into the consideration of the aptness and greediness of our
Nation (and not only of them, but almost of all people whatsoever) both to
entertain and even with a violent belief, to embrace the report of any
Miracle whatsoever, how ever delivered from the mouths or pens of vain
Impostres, or the most untrue speakers, without either examination of the
grossness, or respect of the malicious or fantastical inuentors, nay albeit
it be even repugnant to holy Scriptures, I cannot choose but admire at their
want of faith, especially in these days, wherein truth was never (since the
days of the Apostles) more truly published, and yet such is our natural
blindness, or our wilful Ignorance that if we journey never so safely in the
perfect path of salvation yet we will be drawn astray with the vainest and
lightest report either of prodigious monster or false miracle, witness Garnets
straw, being an imagination and a report as false as Satan himself who is the
Author of all falsehood and yet it is harbored in the hearts and mouths of
many simple seduced people, witness the Jews Prophecy, being an idle, vain
Pamphlet, as gross and grosser then John of Calabria, and was printed many
years ago, and this last year only renewed with the addition of 1607. yet
amongst fools, women and children, retained for such an approved miracle that
as if the gift of prophecy were hereditary to the Jews and their tribes,
there are few things better believed when as in truth there was never any such
Jew, nor any such prophecy but a mere invention, witness Haoker, that would be
no less then Christ, and many other such like, all which being most absurd,
and most improbable. And yet that in these latter days, the man of sin shall
bring in false prophets, false prophesies, false miracles, and false deceivers,
it is most plain in many places of holy Scripture and therefore if such
falshods be the signs of a false Church, and a false religion, then
questionles the Church of Rome has no aliance with truth, since in her these
evils are daily nourisht and engendered almost howerly beguiling and enchanting
the people with the casting out off Devils, and other vain and false
miracles, there may be Miranda multa, and yet indeed miracula nulla, many
wonders as in the Sun, Moon Stars, and firmament, many wonders in the earth,
in the air, and in the waters, some as forerunners of the last day, some as
forwarning us of the evils which hang over us and some as punishments of our
sins and of these wonders, the waters have this year brought forth ye
strangest that has been read of either in this age or any age since the
general flood which has gone before it: as namely that which in the latter
end of January last, happened in So^merset shire, and other parts of the
West-countries, the lamentable report whereof, has already been published and
has almost ^^ld every ear both with pity and wonder, so many souls
perishing, so much goods and Cattle consumed, and so many Townes-houses and
good buyldings ouer-whell, med, that the consideration thereof is able to move
remorse and astonishment in men of the most bloody and barbourous natures, even
such as Vergill writs of the Mirmidons, or Homer of the Thrasians that being as
it were, he wed out off stint and moved with no cruelty, yet wept at the
destruction of Troy, albeit themselves were the greatest actors in that hugh
massacre: like soft hearted executioners that feel a touch of that affliction,
with which the afflicte only, but this first outrage of waters, proceeding
from the great deep, I mean the Sea, albe at, the first it apeared most
fearful and wondrous, and that the effects thereof were both most lamentable
and at first beyond all bound of imagination, some not so strangely perishing,
as others more strangely preserved (the true relation whereof is to be read at
pleasure) yet after the days of sorrow were past over and that the finishing
of nine days had finished the remembrance of the wonder, immediately almost
every one could collect unto himself a natural cause and a proscript and
constant reason both how, why, and which way this inundation was effected: as
one while the violence of the winds holding back the spring tides that they
would not have their free course according to their dispositions, made that two
tides joining in one and coming both with a double power and quantity, it must
of necessity follow that they must rise to a double height and have double
bounds wherein to be contained, which not being found there would not choose
but follow this most sudden fearful, and unexpected Ouer-flow: others
imagined, that the fury of the winds driving the waters before them and
raising as it were a double quantity made the spring tides double their
accustomed greatness, and so ouerflowing their banks to dround all within the
compass of that level. thus men forgetting the powreful hand of the Almighty,
and turning the wallet of their sins behind their backs, began to imagine
like^ natural men, that since there was a natural reason for these natural
causes sure they were not punishments for our transgressions, neither had God
in his displeasure, or for our amendment laid this gentle affliction upon us,
but questionless they were deceived, as may appear evidently by the sequel
of this relation: For in Couentry a City seated in Warwickshire upon the
mount of a small hill, being not near any part of the Sea or falt-water by
many scores of miles, neither where there is any ebding or flowing, neither any
fresh River of any quantity, more then such as a man may at any reasonable time
of the year, either leap or stride over, this City being ever accounted a
very dry City as wanting water either for traffic, or to bear a vessel of
burden. In this City upon Thurseday at night being the ^6. of April the
doors of heaven being opened there fell a great rain, mixed with thunder and
lightning, to the amazement of the Citizens, I do not mean such an amazement
as drove them either to fear or despair but such an amazement as does commonly
follow and depend upon thunder and lightning which are the darts and arrows
of the highest: this rain, this thunder and lightning continued the most part
of all that night even in the greatest extremity that could be imagined, the
heavens as it were even opening and spreading the lightning abroad like
acurtaine, and making the darkness of the night as bright as day, for the
moment it lasted, and the thunder roaring so loud, that it broke the weariest
Laborer from his sleep and recreation: about morning the thunder ceased and
the rain not falling so thick as before, was then no more but an ordinarye
drizling, so that the Plowman betook him to the field, the Laborer to his
work, and the Artificer to his occupation not any whatsoever either fearing or
seeing any cause to fear either extraordinary or ordinary flood or inundation,
now about eight of the clock this morning being Friday the 17. of April,
according to the usual custom of that religious Cittye, the Citizens repaired
to the Church to hear a Lecture, which is usually preach deuery Friday
throughout the whole year, and when they went from their houses, the left them
dry neither saw they any cause of suspicion why they should not so continue,
but when they returned back from the Lecture, they found all the lower parts
of the City ouer-flown, with a most strange and wonderful floode, such a one
as no age, memory or record has ever known in that place from ye first
beginning: the waters being risen within the Cittye in the space of three
quarters of an hour, better then nine foot high, so that their houses stood
like little Islands about which the water beat and seemed to contend with all
violence, much hurt there was done of household goods, many sellers of salt,
corn and other commodities spoiled, but unto the high praise of the great God
of heaven not any man, woman, or child nor any other living creature, that was
of any valuable estimation perished in the waters, only the affliction of
their minds, who being the owners of those houses saw this fearful combat
betwixt their goods and this merciless enemy, how far they were
transported with agony, fear and desperatnesse none can truly judge or write
of, but such as have felt and known the like or a greater extremity, for in
these sudden and miserable disasters, there is ever a diverse and furious
combat of many passions and many afflictions.

This water after it was grown to his full height and strength, it so
continued as in a stay for the space of three hours, giving me^ leave as it
were to behold his dreadfulnes, and to tremble at the work of the highest, and
after the three howrs were expired, it suddenly vanished away beyond all
expectation making his coming in, and his going forth of equal wonder, the
stay of the Flood being almost three times so long, as both his increase and
falling, his increasing, abiding and decaying being in all little above four
hours, yet his extraordinary depth full nine foot by measure, and his bounds
many miles in compass, a wonder more then ever has bin read of, and an
examplary punishment so great and so merciful that it is worthy the recording
to all after ages, for it came only to affright and forwarne, not to afflict
or confound: For first no living soul has perished, no cattle are destroyed,
no houses are ouer-whelmed, and for the loss of private goods and
commodities, it is supposed that the value of 200. marks, will make a full
restitution and yet never came Flood more sudden, never was water in show
more cruel: nor ever were men more secure, or less suspicious of so unlooked
for a danger, but the hand of the Lord is upon his servants, and he will
chastise those which offend, and have mercy where he pleases.

About 19. years agene when the same Gentleman which now is Mayor of the City
of Couentry was then Mayor, it is reported there was then a very strange flood
and so great a Water, that the amazement and rumor thereof ran through the
whole Kingdom, but such as saw both this and that former affirm, that the
flood which fell 19 years ago being compared with this that fell now was but
a small puddle to a great Sea: from which I gather that as our sins do
increase, so these signs and warnings for the amendment of our faltes are
likewise both multiplied and redoubled, and we that will not put on Sackcloth
and ashes at the cry and preaching, not of one Jonas, but of many millions
must either be warned by these wonders, or else look for most sudden
destruction.

In the week before Easter last past in this present year of our Lord God
1607. the Sea forcing a breach through the bank a little from Lynne, Floodes
at Lynne.
came flowing in with such a furious spring tide, that it drowned up a great
part of the Town together with the marshes and grounds thereunto adjoining
and so passing like an invincible host, along the Sea coast, it ouer-flowed to
the number of almost a dozen Towns and Villages; only the people with great
difficulty, and by the fore-warning of the former flood which happened the 20. of
January, escapt with safety of their lives, but most of their cattle were lost
and all their corn and grain consumed.

Flood at Boston.
The like to this the same week before Easter last happened at Boston where the
Sea brake in above the haven and drowned a great part of the Town even almost
to the great-Crosse, and if the vigilance and industry of the Country and the
Commanders thereof had not exceeded both hope and expectation, it was feared
that a great part of that Town and country would have been within the hazard
of bure couerable evil, so mighty was the breach, and so extreme the swelling
of the sea.

Flood in Kent.
The same week before Easter, the Sea brake in upon the I Will of Sheppe, and
drowned the most part of all those grounds, and if the vigilance and wildome of
one private Gentleman had not prevented the fury of the waters, it had borne
away many thousands of sheep and many hundreds of great cattle, but praise
be given to our great God, they were preserved for the benefit of this nation,
only some few were lost, which few it is hoped will be no occasion of dearth
or ensuing scarcity, at the same time that this I Will of Sheppy was thus
drowned, the River of Thames breaking over her banks drowned a great part of
all those Marshes and low grounds which border upon her, wherein many cattle
were lost, and an infinite deal of good grass made utterly unfit for this
years service.

Lastly and which of all was most strange and miraculous at the Town of
Stopworth upon the edge of Ches-shre, Flood at Stopworth.
through which there passes a river from thence down to Warington, upon a
nights caine in the week before Easter last the water risse and ouerflowed
both some part of the town, and all the plains that were adjoining, a thing
never till that time beheld by any man, and as diverse men dwelling about those
parts, and which were eyebeholders of the inundation have reported, that the
river for many hours together seemed to be carried against his course, even
toward the head and upper part of the river a thing both strange, unreasonable
and unnatural, from which we may gather many observations for our souls
health, as the testimonies of Gods great power, the marquable signs of his
mercies and the true touch and feeling of our own sins which touch breeding
in us remorce and penance and that penance a satisfaction for our sin? and a
detestation of our sins no doubt but we shall have the threatening of Gods
wreath removed and be the inioyers of the bliss of his Kingdom.
