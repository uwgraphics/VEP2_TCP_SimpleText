The kind hearted Creature:
Or,
The prettest jest that er'e you knew,
Yet I Will say nothing but what is true:
I once heard of a cunning Whore,
But never the like of this before.
To the tune of the Mother beguiled the Daughter:


AL you that are disposed now,
to hear a merry jest,
By me shall be disclosed how,
a bonny Less confessed,
That she had loved one or two,
nay two or three and twenty,
I cannot tell what they did do,
but she had Lovers plenty,
Sing Boys, drink Boys,
why should we not be merry:
I Will tell you of a bonny Less,
and her Love beyond the Ferry.
This bonuy less had caught a clap
it seems by some young shauer,
She being match with such mishap
the Ladds began to leave her,
Though she will of their company,
some one made sure his bargain
But she was loved of so many,
that it is worth regarding.
Yet she will sing, and always say
drink round and let us be meny,
I have a love in Lankeshire,
and a little beyond the ferry.
She now being called to account,
for to discribe aright,
What young man was the Faster on it
and her own hearts delight
But she could not resolve the same,
because there was so many,
She knew not 's trade nor yet his name,
for she was free for any.
Sing Boys, etc.
Quoth she and if it have a Book,
then it was the man in the Gown,
Or other-wayes an't have a hook,
it was the sheephard on the down,
Or if it have a whip in 's hand:
then sure it was a carter,
Or if it cannot go nor stand,
I think it was drunken Artor.
Sing Boys, etc.
And if it have a new fash'on,
it was one came out of France,
And if it be a Musician:
it was one taught me to dance,
And if in's hand a needle be,
then sure it was a Tailor.
Or if it chance to cross the Sea,
I think it was a saylor.
Sing Boys, drink boys,
why should we not be merry,
I have a love in Lankeshire,
and a little beyond the ferry.
The second part
To the same tune.


ANd if it have a Hammer,
then sure a Smith was he,
And if it be full of manner,
it was one of good degree,
Or if it have a shuttle,
a weauer sure was he then,
And if that it be wise and sutle,
it was one of the baylifes yong-men.
Sing Boys etc.
And if it have a long lock,
a Courtier sure was he,
And if it be a pretty cock,
then that was William he,
And if it have a shoe in 's hand,
it was the boon Shoemaker,
Or if it have a durty hand,
it was sure a donghill raker.
Sing boys etc.
And if it have a Kettle,
then sure he was a Tinker:
And if it be full of Mettle,
it was sure a good Ale-drinker
And if that it be Gresie,
then sure it was a Butcher:
And if that it be lousy,
then sure it was a Botcher.
Sing Boys, etc.
And if ins hand a flower be,
a Gardner was the man sure,
And if it love to take a Fee,
I think it was the Pariture:
And if it be in a gown of gray,
it was one that lives ith Country,
And if that it be fresh and gay,
it was one the common gentry.
Sing Boys, etc.
And if it have a Pen ins hand,
then sure it was a Scrivner,
And if ith the Tauern he love to stand
then sure it was a Vintner:
And if it have a drowsy eye,
it was him that they call sleeper,
And if with bromes and horns he cry
it was sure the Chimney-sweeper.
Sing Boys, etc.
And if ins hand he have a Bunne,
then sure it was a Baker,
And if he love to drink ith Tun,
it was then the good Alemaker:
And if he love to ride a Horse,
I think it was an Ostler,
Or else it it was the man oath Cross,
that was a valiant Wrastler.
Sing Boys, etc.
And if it have a mealy face,
it was him that grines the corn,
And if a long note be in place,
it is him that winds the horn,
And many more I here might name,
which loved me once most dearly,
But that indeed it is a shame,
for enough is shown hereby.
Sing boys etc.
Now all the hope I have is this,
my barn must have a Father,
And I confess I did amiss,
would I had repented rather,
Yet there is a youngman loves me well
but I could nere abide him,
I know of me hel'e have no fear,
though many will deride him,
Sing boys etc.
