To HIS MVCH HONORED VIRTUOUS SISTER, the Lady PALMER, wife to Sir ANTHONY
PALMER, Knight of the Bath: Her Brother L. D. wishes increase of all true
Felicity, etc.
MY dear Sister, the Dedication of this Poem can belong to none more fitly,
then to your self; since (next under God) your care of me in a desperate
sickness, made me live to finish it. It is a Translation, and therefore far
short of the Original, the rather because mine:) A Work not so pleasing for
Ladies (being in it self lofty, and harsh in the translation.) It was intended
to you, as a Pattern for a piece of Needle Work (I knew you were about;) for
which purpose; I persuade my self, no Poetical Author will with more variety
furnish you, then Claudian: howsoever he or I fail* yet this first labor may
seem as an earnest-penny of my affection, and to tell you, that all true
happiness in this life, and eternal in the next, is wished unto you*

By your Brother and friend, obliged ever to serve you, L. D.

To the READER.
GEntle Reader, I present to thy view the three first books of Claudian us, de
raptu Proserpinae in English Verse: a work (how pleasing it may prove, I know
not) since of my Author, Scaliger says, he was materia ignobiliore oppressus,
but addidit de ingenio quantum defuit materiae, which wit, the Translators
harshnesse of style may (happily) have diminished. The Reader will find many
faults; one I willingly here prevent, which is, that Ceres is described in the
first book to be drawn by six Dragons, contrary to all Poets, that allow her
but two: This and some few other errors I impute unto the hastiness of the
Press, which the ingenious Reader will pardon, especially if the maine work
give that light (that I hope for) to the Original.

Farewell. L. D.

THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.
The Historical Sense or meaning of the Story.
WHen men for their finnes, like other creatures, were forced to ordinary
food: the bread which they ate of (as Eusebius and Suidas mention) was of
Acornes: and Plutarke writes, that after the Flood it was of the same. At that
time, Siculus reigned King of Sicilie, whose wife (named Ceres) a woman of a
singular apprehension (to try a Conclusion) took some of the wild Wheat,
which grows naturally so in that Country, and sowed seeds of the same, and
was careful to till them: these in their due time produced of that Grain in
great abundance, which she caused to be molded into a paste, and (finding
the sweetness of it) still sowed more and more, till she attained to the
perfection of Tillage; (with which she instructed all her Islanders) so that
the Sicilians were the first Husbandmen in the world, and taught other
Nations, till such time as Wheat became the general nourisher of all men.

The commodity the Sicilians reaped hereby, and the multitudes of such as
applied themselves to Tillage, were the causes of the divisions of lands
(touching which, Ceres made sundry laws) some of which remain even at this
day with us: and for this cause the blind Gentiles adored her as a goddess,
and consecrated that Island of Sicilie unto her, as to the inuentresse of
Harvest.

It happened that this Ceres had a daughter, called Proserpina; who, for her
exceeding beauty was affected by Orion King of Epirus and the Molossians, and
by him stolen away in the absence of her Mother Ceres: who when she returned,
and found that her daughter was thus gone (ignorant of the Rauisher) went
ranging up and down the world to find her, and in her progress she sowed
all the Fields with Wheat as she went, till such time as she found Orion out.

This Story gave matter to Poets, to feign, that Pluto stole away Proserpina
from Sicilia, in her mothers absence (who missing her at her return) sought
her through the world, till she had found her with two blazing lights: and
knowing that she was in hell with Pluto, requested of Jupiter, that she might
remain with her one half of the year upon Earth, and the other with her
Husband Pluto.

The Natural Sense of the Story.
BY the person of Ceres is signified Tillage. By Proserpine, the seeds which
are sowed, by Pluto, the earth that receives them.

By the diligence that Ceres used in searching her daughter, is shown the care
that Husbandmen ought to have in the tilling and sowing their grounds, and
reaping of their Harvest.

By the six Months that Proserpine remained in Hell, are understood, the
six, in which the seed is under ground, before the ears appear; and by the
other six that she is with her Mother, is set down, when the corn is ripe,
and in possession of the Husbandman.

By the blazing lights, with which Ceres seeks her daughter, is meant the
vigilancie of the Husbandman in providing for the increase of his harvest.

By the lights themselves, are signified the instruments of Husbandry, without
which the Corn could hardly be reaped.

The Allegorical Sense.
BY Pluto and his sudden resolution of marrying and warring against gods, is
noted, the nature and disposition of the insolent rich man, who blinded with
ease and plenty, desires immoderately all that his Concupiscence leads him
unto.

By the Destinies that strive to divert Pluto from his purpose, is seen the
force of heavenly power above humane.

Mercurie's, being sent Ambassador to Jupiter, declares how necessary it is
that persons of a lively capacity and mature judgment, be sent to take up
strife and iarres betwixt Princes.

By Jupiters decree to give Proserpine for wife to Pluto, is shown the Divine
Providence, that disposes better of things for us, then we our selves can wish.

By Proserpine left alone in her mothers absence at her work, is noted the
good education of Children, to which mothers are bound, that are honest and
careful.

By Ceres leaving her alone, and Pluto's stealing her away, is put (as an
example): That Mothers ought not to be so careless of their children, as to
expose them to so great a hazard of their honors.

By Venus Executioneresse of Jove's will, and Diana and Pallas her Companions,
is signified: that love is a divine connection and bond, ordained from God, if
the proceeding in the same be with simplicity and pureness of meaning.

THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.
The Argument of the First Book
Pluto e(...) would ma^^y, threatens war
Against Jupiter, the Fates prevent their jar:
Swift Mercury Ambassador is sent
To heaun, to tell the gods of this event.
Jove, Ceres daughter does resolve to give
His brother, and the means does thus contriue;
Whilst Ceres absent is in Phrygia,
Venus must egg abroad Proserpina:
Down she descends the Virgin chaste to see,
Diana, Pallas, bear her company.
MY lofty Muse is full, and bids me sing
The robbery of Hell's infernal king,
Grimme Pluto; and the Carre of Taenarus,
That whilome with portentionsominous
And giddie hurrie, through the blasted air,
Presagd the Rape of Proserpine the fair,
Jove's daughter, and the marriges event:
Profaner ears be you from hence exempt.
And now the fury of a Spirit Divine,
Expell's all humane fear from this of mine:
Apollo breathes in me, Phoebus inspires
My brain, my quill with his most sacred fires.
Now, now (me thinks) I on a sudden see,
The Shrine of each immortal deity,
Shake in it is quiu'ring seat (vnus'd to move)
And the Celestial rays (that from above
Disperse their glim'ring light) forerunners are,
Of Pluto's iourny and sad Ceres care.
The noise (that in the earth's deep womb does sound)
I hear, and Athens Temple so renowned,
For her King Cecraps painfully does groan,
(Doubling shrill Eccho's to the Cities moan:)
And Ceres loved Eleusis tapers blaze
With flaring lights which to the skies they raise:
Triptolem's snakes their bloody crests aloft
Vpstretch, and with confused murmur soft,
Glide their spot-painted bodies here and there,
At which Spectators tremble, themselves fear:
They hiss, and with strange accent to my Verse
Hasten the Tragic song that I rehearse.
The three-folde Hecate appears in sight,
And lazy Bacchus (madding) does affright
The eyes of mortals with his shiu'ring lance
Of wreathed Vines, and in a drunken dance
(Loading his Temples with an Yuie crown,
Whose weight keeps his unwieldy body down)
Knits to his neck a Parthian Tyger's paws,
And skin (that from his shoulder down he draws)
You gods (on whom Auernus wandering souls,
And multitudes of wights black Styx enroules)
Attend, and such as of their worldly crimes,
In burning Phlegeton bewail the times.
You gods, you fathers, show; declare to me
The secrets of earths vaste concauity;
Your governments reveal, and mysteries
Of all those great and powerful deities.
Tell me, since Love so low would never bend
His shafts, what fire could Pluto thus incend?
As snatching off from earth this Proserpine,
He makes her his eternal Concubine:
Yet comforts her (that in the Tyrants power,
Laments) by giving Lethe for her dower.
Tell me, did Ceres her grieved mother know
Before, what should succeed? or if not so,
When she was lost, in her distracted mind,
Where could she hope her Proserpine to find?
That (longing for good news) she makes a vow,
The barren earth with fairest wheat to sow.
Long since, the dismal Prince of Erebus
(Through wrath and fury grown outrageous)
To see that he (a god) and young, alone,
Must lead a solitary life in moan,
Wanting a mate, that days, months, years retire
And pass (regardlesse of his quenchlesse fire)
Impatient of delays and full of jar,
He summons all the supreme gods to war;
Disdaining they above should note his want,
Of happy marriage to be ignorant.
Red lips, fair eyes, sweet looks, soft cherishing
Confused embraces, limbs proportioning,
To their proportion all strange delight,
Two souls combined in one, which make one white:
Like yuie (twining) yuorie neck, that one,
One body, which one common breath alone,
Gives life unto: this one, and yet not one
For (lovers) each has a Companion:
So two, when as two bodies striving move
In Cuptds lists (made one by mutual love.)
These two, that one and all as motives are,
Egging stern Pluto to ambitious war:
The name of father, and proud hope of sons,
(Each) a forerunner of new strife becomes:
Forthwith the Monsters of infemall deep,
Rank out their squadrons, and good order keep.
The ugly Fiends coniur'd by Plutos wroth,
Against highest Jupiter take solemn oath;
And menacing the gods in sad array
Of battle, hels black banners they display
Before heavens walls, and discord first appears
(Cladde all in ruth:) in arms of steel she bears
The portraict of her name, and next to her
Imperious Famine rages, and base fear
(Placed as a Scout, or as a Runnagate,
Against the foe to annoy them, cankred hate,
Despairefull sorrow, rashness out of breath
March last (led in the rere by conquering death.
Against thundering Jove, the pallid Furies three
Combine themselves, and bold Tisiphone
That bout her head those curled Snakes does twine
With spinie fist, that of combustions pine
A firebrand brandisheth, whose boading light
Compassion moves, and megar looks affright
Of her, the sad beholder: 'gins to sound
Through all the Camp, and among the hel-hounds round,
A soft retreat (at whose well-knowne voice)
The pale faced Monsters couch, and hush their noise.
The Elements, whose equal qualities
For many an Age in peace could simpathize,
Scarce now contain, but into discord turn,
And feign to their old Chaos would return:
Proud Titans offspring hope at length to see
Their gyues knocked off, and former liberty:
That (breaking up hels dung'ons) once again,
Punish they may the Author of their shame.
Pluto, Aegaeons fancy now can please,
That long has layne cubb'd up in little ease,
And losing straight the Giants hundred hands,
(Armed to obey the threatening Gods commands)
He musters up his seu'nteene brothers more
Unto a second Combat (for before
They plotted had against heaven) and now they long
Jove's thunder to retort the gods among.
When soon the reu'rend Destinies that see
Stern wars approach, and hels infantery
Range into battle, with stout puissance,
And fearful march against heavens gates advance:
So many horrid fiends that likely were
To put the gods, and all Jove's host in fear:
And (doubting lest the terror of this fight,
The Orbs Celestial endanger might)
Even in the heat and danger of the rowt
They gently tread, and pace the Camp throughout;
And prouidently thus themselves intrude
With modest threats, to tame the multitude:
Then prostrate before the valiant General,
With bended knees and humble looks they fall;
(Spreading their aged Cheeks and frontes severe,
With dangling tresses of their snowie hair.)
Their hands they join, those hands that spun the thread
Of many living, many thousans dead;
Those hands they join, to whose high soueraign'ty,
The World, and all things breathing Vassals be:
First, Lachesis, the eldest of the three,
And most austere, diuides in modesty
The hoary threads, which (for she nastie keeps)
Vncomb'd, they thwart and hide her wrinkled cheeks:
In her own name, and sisters both, she greets
Black Pluto, and to mitigate his threats
Against Jove, first weeps: then wiping her sad eyes,
With fainting voice she to him gently cries,
And thus begins. Thou mighty king (says she)
Great Ruler of our vaste obscurity,
Thou (to whose sacred judgment) the least wight
That groans in darkness, and hels horrid night
Is subject; thou, whom loyal Fates have served
So long and from thy precepts never sweru'd,
With web and spindle; thou that first give breath
To all things living, thou, whom life and death,
Equally wait on; thou, to whom the sage
Fleet time, what ruins he in every age
Collects, does give; and unto thee the state
Of present things does likewise consecrate:
And lastly thou, by whom, the Souls condemned
Have second being, torture without end.
Seek not (great Prince) to have thine honor stained
(By breach of sacred laws we first ordained:)
Cause thy robustious troops retire, and cease
T'incense them further against high heavens peace
Desist from hostile arms (impiety)
Of making brother gods thine enemy;
But if thou needs wilt venture, be no more
A power Divine, but some wild savage Bore:
Must Giant race enjoy a second light,
And once again outbraue in Martial fight
Th'vnconquer'd gods? Fie Pluto: do not thus
Attempt a War so sacrilegious,
And headlong cast thy Majesty, forbear;
(If Marri'ge be the cause; or if thou fear
Lest Jove deny thee issue) mildly prove
Great Jupiter: first let him hear thy love.
Pluto hears Lachesis: and though his rage
Were such, as her fair speech could scarce assuage;
Yet when the lofty love struck god, might see,
The Sisters both to her soft prayers agree;
The blood that rises in each black swollen vain,
He tempereth: the Furies straight proclaim
His altered purpose, cu'ry Fiend that droopes
To see this change, they lash, and force hels troops
Retire, thus was this fatal enterprise,
Dismissed, and Pluto calmed by Destinies.
So blustering Boreas (when with roaring gust,
And whirle-winde armed) he first does lay the dust,
Then with a sudden and tempestuous blast,
(Enraged) he feign upon earth's face would cast;
Thick storms of hayle even at the instant, when
With full swollen cheeks he breaks his loathed den,
And (scowring the vaste Seas) would cause their floods
Arise (to drown the fields and neighboring woods:)
Even then the milder Aeolus restraines
His force, and keeps him fettered in strong chains.
Pluto commands that subtle Mercury
Ioue's son (being summoned to appear from high)
Approach his presence, and from thence be sent
To tell the gods his Uncles discontent:
The winged messenger without delay
(Swifter then thought) through the dull air makes way,
And with his colored hat, and charming rod
Forthwith appears before the infernal god;
Who, in the darkest Vault of all, sat (placed
Upon a black rude throne:) so meanly graced
With scepter course; only his visage stout,
The horror of his Majesty set out:
Over his head hangs up a dismal Cloud,
Which serves for cloth of state, and now aloud
'Twixt rage and grief he groans, and feign would speak,
When, at first accent of his words (that break
Through hearers ears) at their first hideous sound,
The royal palace and moist chambers round
All shake again; and at the fearful note
The triple Porter stops his howling throat:
The three sad rivers at th'vnusuall voice
Affrighted stand, and stop their murmuring noise,
All hell was silent; but their king exceeds,
And to his yelling Embassy proceeds.
Jove's high-borne brood, Cylenian Mercury:
Old Atlas Nephew, common deity
To heaven and hell: thou, that have passage free
Through both the Poles, and equal liberty;
Thou, that of all the gods both high and low,
The mysteries and strict comerce do know:
Fly hence, with speedy wing cut through the wind,
To thy ungrateful Sirethus speak our mind,
What right have thou, or what prioritie,
(Cruel'st of all thy brothers) over me?
Say, Fortune blind with an unequal hand,
(To me denying) gave thee heavens command?
Yet are these temples honored with a crown,
As well as thine, nor can thy pride beat down
Our glory; though we want the light, thou shall
Perceive our strength, when I thy walls assault:
Think thou the Cyclop's handy-worke I fear;
Or those vain claps that mock the yielding air?
Cast down thy darts of thunder, let them strike
Affrighted mortals, we are farte unlike
To such; Know, Jupiter, I keep my vow,
And to revenge my griefs, am sure (though slow)
VVas't not enough? I then repined not
At Fates, that first to my accursed lot
Gave this third kingdom, and deprived quite,
(Though satisfied) I never sought for light:
Nor wished bright Phoebus might descend so far
As my sad palace, or the morning star
Lighten these vaults; when unto thee the seau'n,
(That make Charles-wayne twinkle in spangled heaven)
And millions more thy glorious state adorn:
Poor I, that all in darkness sit forlorn
(Discomfortably mournful) no glad sight
Enjoy, but waste in a perpetual night,
Where are no comforts to the eye or ear,
Nothing but noise, and notes of ghastly fear,
For what harmonious music has hells king?
Where ghosts keep howling time, whilst scriech-owles sing:
Yet thou that see me bare of all relief,
(The more to aggrauate my sullen grief)
Forbidd'st me Nuptial rites; thus Jove repines
At Pluto's wishes, when his Concubines
Are numberless; the Sea-god happier is,
(Though less in power then I) and has more bliss,
That when the raging billows he allayes,
Fair Amphitrite with her Neptune plays
And he (entangled in her soft embrace)
Forgets the use of his three-forked mace.
When thou in midst of Tytans scorching heat,
With labor of thy thunderclaps do sweat
To cool the partch't earth, with moist drops of rain,
And (weary of thy toil turn'st back again)
Incestuous Juno sits in longing state
With open lap her Lord to recreate:
Latona, Ceres, Themis: (each of which
Sufficient were) but all of these, enrich
Thee, with the name of father, and thy seat
Keep still with hopeful successors repleace:
Thus thou, in lustful riot (varying)
Live at thine ease, whilst I (thy brother king)
In darkest dungeon (like a slane) am void
Of those delights, with which thou most art cloid:
And thus my prime of youth does fade, and pride
Of issue, fails; (by wanting alov'd Bride)
But come revenge, awake dull patience,
(Suffice long pardon for so just offense)
By all the shades of night, by all the Ghosts
That houer over black Styx, by all the hosts
Of dreadful horror, mischief vengeance dire,
If Jupiter deny this last desire;
The walls of Tartarus shall open wide
(Thorough whose breach) the souls that there abide
(Condemned to endless ruth) shall sally out,
And have thy downfall with confused rowt:
(Among whom) old Saturn once again shall free
The golden age from her captivity.
(This said) the Tyrant ceast, and to his ire
Gave respit. Mercury (like nimble fire)
Mean while ascends up to the highest Sphere,
And tells his message to great Jupiter.
The god, unto this unexpected news
Gave strict attention, and forthwith' gins muse
In his divine breast, what would be the event
Of such a marri'ge, who would be content
(Of all the goddesses) to lose the light
In lieu she may be queen of lasting night,
And (like a Judge reuoluing many a doubt,
At length resolved) his sentence thus breaks out,
One only child the goddess Ceres had
One daughter, which does make her mother glad:
For though Lucina blessed her with no more,
Yet is she happy in this first she bore.
This serves for many, and the want supplies,
That second birth her barren womb denies.
This (as her dearest darling and delight)
She often hugges, still tends, and from her sight
She never let us her part; so Heifer young
Or first years Calfe, (that other beasts among
Scarce presses the soft grass with wanton tread,
Nor horned Moons, yet peep from curled head:)
The lowing Damme (that it by chance does miss)
(Finding) does give it many a licking kiss.
The Virgin fair was grown now ripe and near
To Hymen's rites, a chaste and shamefast fear
Breeds in her breast new flames: now she desires
(One while) to marry; then again loves fires
Despitefully she quenches; thus, her mind
Even in a moment, makes her cursed and kind;
To love, and not to like; which mystery
Is caused by fear, that bears the mastery
Over her will (her will that often does call
Her passions up) but fear straight lays them all:
Now store of suitors throng and each 'gins ply
Old Ceres, for her daughter (cunningly)
Two great Competitors, with equal strife
Contend, to have the lovely Maid to wife:
Mars with his shield, Apollo with his bow
And shafts, their greatnesses alike both show.
Both offer a round earnest for their loves;
Yet neithers suite the yellow Ceres moves:
Nor though proud Juno and Latona too
Speak for their sons and (severally woo)
Would she consent: but (as a mother kind
In her own thoughts) and with fond passion blind:
(Unwitting future rape) her too too dear,
She sought to hide from those she least might fear.
And thus (descending from Olympus high,
With her fair Proserpine) both secretly
At fruitful Scicile arrive; and there,
The careful mother in a jealous fear,
Viewes the rich Island, and the Sea that round
Does ring-like compass, and its fertile ground,
Sprinkle; th'vnknowing goddess straight conceiues
The place for purpose fitting, and so leaves
Her daughter to it is charge: thus neither she,
Nor it, soresawe th'ensuiug prodigy.
Sicilia once the Continent did touch,
And made a part of Italy, till, such
Was the Seas rage, and Nereus swelling pride,
As did the firm land sever and divide:
He with his subtle art, and puissance stout
The confines broke, and cut those mountains out,
Which, to the little land did there remain,
Contiguous were; now (parted from the maine)
He bathes them with his waves, yet men may see
'Twixt both the Lands a known affinity.
The Promontories that are seen from far,
Pachinus high, and Lilibeum are
On which the waves that (brauing play) let flee
Their force, and make continual battery:
Pachinus shows unto the Ionian Sea
His lofty head; the top of Lylibe
Looks to the Libian Coast, from whence (in vain)
The waves drives through his arms, which (as a reine
And bridle serve t'abate and curb their pride
And roaring noise;) when Thetis to abide
Disdaineth there, and from the Thuscane shore,
Her waves upon Pelorus beat much more.
These Promontories three, at first the I Will
(Sicilia now) Trinacria did style:
In midst of which Aetna of old renown
(For burning rocks) so high his flaming crown
Lifts; that the Promontories (which before
Did Giants seem) like Dwarfes his height adore:
Aetna, true witness of Briareus
His folly, and of bold Enceladus
The Tomb and bonefire; where, he lives in death,
And spits forth fire with brimstone-pois'ning breath:
The Mountains load, there, keeps him prisoner fast,
That when the weighty burden off to cast
He (groaning) strives, and to his utmost strains
To quit his rebel neck from yoke and pains:
The poor Inhabitants he makes fear
(By often shaking) lest some Earthquake there
Should root the Islands up, and so, her towrs,
And walls, the violence of Seas deuours:
This Mountains top, is only to the eye
Of mortals subject; so you may descrie
The smoke and flames, but never has it yet
Been trampled on by any humane feet:
With stately Groves and Trees, the lower part
Is decked, that never were planted there by Art;
The upper, commonly with misty fogge
Stains the Sunbeams, and days clear light does clog
With pitchy Clouds, which (lasting until night)
Ascend the Firmament, and days clear light
Convert to darkness; still the flames increase
Is nourisht (though the mountains self decrease.)
In midst of boiling heat, the snow does fall
Upon the top, and never melts at all:
It snowes upon the Mountain, and that heat
Which burns there (albeit never so great)
The snow it never offends, whose inward cold
Condenseth it, and if dissolve some should,
(By reason of hot vapors that arise)
Yet most upon the top congealed is,
Or never lower falls: but that which breeds
The greatest admiration, and exceeds
All common wonder, is the noise within
The hollow Cliftes, that does never linne
It Is raging, whether caused by the wind,
That stopped in Aetnas bowels feign would find
A passage out, and cannot, till it break
With speedy motion through some open creake
Of the torn rocks, till when, it rumbles there;
Or else the greedy Sea, whose arms do tear
The Mountains bosom, and the brackish waves
Mingling with fires in those hot sulf'rous caves
Within, and wanting means to sally thence,
Add matter to the broiling violence
And noise; uncertain whether of the twain
It is, but one may be the reason plain.
Diuinest Ceres now most confident
Of the sure Island (to whose charge she lent
And left her dearest pledge) without all fear
Or least suspicion of her danger near,
To Phrigia posteth, and amain does hie
To her torn foundresse mother Cybele.
By six fierce Dragons, that (tail wheeling round
With writhed limbs) her chariot lift from ground,
She carried is, and snatched into the air,
From whence her speedy flight (they swift) prepare,
And, breaking through the clouds, that give them way,
Them leave behind; and (posting) lead away
With giddy gallop, the free raines they bear
Upon their lofty crests (bemoistned were
With foamie froth) which on their golden scales
They cast, and doubly spot their winged sails:
One while the middle Region they divide,
And soar aloft; then suddenly they slide
Down to the earth, and slacking of their flight,
The Chariots golden wheels they cover (white)
With hoarie dust: their Mistress (as she goes)
Her bounty casts, and plenteously bestows
Over all the fields: the very tract and path
(Made by her wheels) sufficient plenty has
Of rip'ned ears; which (as she passes on)
Cloth all the fields and ways they run upon
With golden habit. Thus behind her quite
Aetna she leaves, and th'Island out of sight,
Till (looking back with her presaging eyes,
And moist'ned cheeks) the palace she espies
Where she her daughter left; then with fresh tears
She doubles her prognosticating fears
(As doubtful of the fatal accident)
And thus the hard mishap would feign prevent
(By courting the fair Island) Dearest Earth,
Blessed Soil (says she) farewell: my first, last birth,
I leave unto thy charge; look well to her,
Be thou her guardian safe, since I prefer
Thee before other places: as thy care
Shall speed, the mindful Ceres will not spare
For thy reward: be sure of this before,
The cruel Spade shall never wound thee more;
Nor rugged Clown (when he thy fields will sow)
Shall once, with crooked tooth of deluing plow,
Tear up thy fruitful entrails; thou shall make
Glad husbandmen to wonder, and forsake
The use of toyling Oxen, and sharp Goad,
When (of their own accord) thy fields shall load
Their Barnes; and (for thy seasonable fruit)
Their storehouse, neighboring lands shall thee salute.
This said, her Dragons haste, and she arriues
Upon Mount Ida, where Cybete lives:
Her Temple, there, with marble statue stands,
(That worshipped is by many vprear'd hands,
Covered with thickest boughs of blazing Pine)
That seldom subject is to storms or wind:
The furious Air does seldom lash, or beat
This consecrated Tree to goddess great;
But (gently whistling amongst the leaves) it bears
And forms soft music to the hearers ears:
Within the Temple, naught but dancing is
To Bacchus, and confused melodies
Of men, that (with their howling consorts round
Of squeaking Pipes and rusticke Tabors sound)
Shake Idas top; the holy shrines within
The Temple groan (moved with the noise and dinne:)
At sight of Ceres all grows hushed and still,
The balling Quire, the Drum and Trumpets shrill
Desist; the Corybantes cease to wave
Their glittering blades, the Lions fierce and brave
Are tamed, and their gentleness is such,
As they their shaggy maines to every touch
Submit; the longing Ceres enters in,
And by the mother of the gods within
She welcomed is, that at first entering place
Bows down her Towr's to do the goddess grace.
Jove from his supreme throne of majesty
This passage viewes, and his most strict decree
To Venus loved reueales, to thee, I will,
(Says he) o Cytherea show my will
And heavenly pleasure: know, I am resolved
That my firm purpose long ago reuolu'd
In hidden thoughts, do now it self declare,
Be now fulfilled, that Ceres daughter fair
Be given to hels black king; for Destinies
Do so command, and Themis prophecies
Have thus foretold: the time inuites to this,
Her careless mother far off wandering is;
Go then, and to Sicilia take thy flight,
That (when bright Sol, the mournful robe of night
Displayes, and clads the fields in gorgeous ray)
Entice thou may the maid, to sport and play
In Floras walks; that (when thy skill is tried,
Pluto may seyze upon his lovely Bride:
Unfitting 'twere (since all the gods, and me
Thou burn'st) the lowerkingdomes should be free.
No, no; let fell Erynnis feel thy flame,
And Acheron acknowledge the great name
Of Venus; she gave ear, and (having heard
Her fathers mind) to journey straight prepared:
Pallas and she (that with the horne-bent bow,
Arcadian Maenalus affrights) both go
(Together) with their sister, for so Jove
Commanded had; they out of filial love
Their Sire obey, and (taking solemn leave
Of all the gods) them of their sight bereave.
Look how a Comet (seldom seen) appears
To vulgar eyes, and fills men with strange fears:
When (streaming over the world with bloody light)
It boades unto the peoples gazing sight
Some rare event: (as death of Monarke great,
Or rage of sickness sprung from Dog-dayes heat:)
That, to the trembling Mariner (at hand)
Threatens huge storms, plagues, famine to the land;
So showed the ayry tracke this troop divine
Had made (amazing with it is glorious shine.)
At length, they Ceres palace had espied
And glorious lust're of it is top descride,
And pinacles; that (as they nearer drew)
The goodly frame they might at leisure view:
(A wondrous work) erected first of all
By the black laboring Cyclop's; the high wall
Of hard and strongest Thracian Ir'n was made,
The massy posts that sustained and stayed
The weighty building up, of steel: and wrought
The rest was, with the Metal thither brought
By those industrious Chalybes; who found
The first use of it underneath the ground.
Never was great Pyracmon busied more,
Or toyling Sterops sweat so much before,
As ('bout this curious work:) never (till then)
So (puffing, breathless) Vulcans iourny-men
Knock on their battered Anuiles sparkling steel,
(Held by the crooked biting tongs) that feel
Their hammers load: never was huger flame
Raised from the weary Furnace, then that same
Which, from the softened mass of metal thence
Arose; nor bellows, with more violence
Breathed on the burning Forge. Behold you might
From far, the gates (shining with yu'ry) white,
The top and battlements that outwardly
Appeared, with silver and black Ebonie
Checkr'd; the sollid beams the roof uphold
Within, of brass; and pillars of pure gold?
Here lovely Proserpine, with melting tone,
Sat, to her dying honor (all alone)
VVarbling a swan-like farewell: for, she meant
With work in hand, and needle, to present
Unto her Mother (whom she longs to see
And still expects) her painful industry
Drawn out in curious sampler; and so thought,
(In vain) to frame a robe of it (being wrought:)
There she her fathers kingdom first began
In lively colors to paint out; and than
Four Elements (each in their order placed)
With cunning hand she flourisht, and so graced
The pattern with her skill, you could not know
Whether the fire were burning there or no:
Somewhat beneath (in region clear and fair)
She figured had the fresh and lively air,
And next, the water, where she often makes
A period to her handy-worke; and takes
Fresh silk to thread her needle, for she here
Had much ado to make the Sea appear
In all his forms; the waves she to the life
Describes, and set out their tumultuous strife:
The waters were with purple wrought, the shore
With Emeralds and Pearls all shadowed over;
Behold you might the sedge and greenish weed
Flote from the Rocks (as if they there did breed
Where she had placed them) with such Art conceived,
That wary Pilots well might be deceived
In viewing them; then forth a different skeine
Of silk she sorts, and fresh to work again
Begins, those sands, the brackish waters drink:
Those sands, so like; that lookers on would think
They heard the Seas hoarse murmr: last of all,
To the earth she comes, yet (for the original
Was but a dull piece, and gross element)
Less labor in describing that she spent:
Only some green and yellow would bestow
Upon the fields and flowr's that in them grow:
And (for vartety) amongst the rest,
That of Narcissus story she expressed;
Where (opposite) the new transformed Rose,
The thorne-prick't goddess love to Adon shows.
(These Elements thus finished to her mind)
Five different Zones, each in a seu'rall kind
And quality she notes, a crimson thread
The middle woue (flaming all fiery red
Inhabitable) on both sides of that
She placed the other two, more temperate:
The two most cold (as needless to be drawn)
She prettily thus figured in the Lawne
Wherein she work't; (a space there left) and so
The Samplers white alone expressed their snow.
Next to her Uncles palace she descends,
(Proportioning his Furies, Fates and Fiends;
But here she stopp't: for (looking on her work,
As if some ominous event did lurk
Under these dismal Pictures) from her eyes
Tears (forming pearls) dropped on the Destinies:
And (weary of that sad task) she began
To sort new colors to the Ocean;
Whose Crystal winding streams, she there drew out
Upon the utmost border of her clowt.
But suddenly the hinges of her door,
With creaking noise were turned, and her before
The goddesses she spies, so all in haste
The imperfect work and robe she from her cast;
With maiden blush and fearful modesty,
Upon her silver cheeks a skarlet dye
She spradde; unlike to this, the Lydian Dame
With Tyrian purple spots her yu'rie frame;
Now Phoebus diu'd into the west, and night
With lazy Carre, and dullness does inuit
The world to rest; whilst Pluto warned by Jove
His journey plot's, and conquest of his love.
And lo, th'vnseene Commandresse, secretly,
Of fearful wagon; to her axletree,
The harnest thongs, and coupled horses ties
Horses, that, on the filth and scumme which rise
From bottom of Cocytus, feed: that graze
In fields of Erebus and hels black lays,
When (drunk with Let he) up into the world
Oblivion from their frothy mouths is hurled.
Orphnaeus (shaking his unruly head)
And Aethon (swift as flight) together tread
And (trampling in the infernal entry) beat
Each fire struck flint from it is vnpaued sear:
Nicteus, with his staring maine, the best
Of Stygian brood, with brave Alaster dressed
And ready harnest; both together stand
And (reared on end) Alectos stern command.
With scornful neighing mock: (full of disdain)
The cole black four, scarcely themselves contain
Within hell gates (mad) on their masters prize
Which he expects, upon the mornes vprise.
Finis Libri Primi.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.
The Argument of the Second Book.
Proserpina suspectlesse of her woes
With Venus, Pallas, and Diana goes
To Aetna, on whose skirts the morning howr's
They spend, and crown their temples with his flowr's:
Pluto his prey does snatch; the goddesses
Pallas and Dian, follow to release
Their Sister: Jove his clowdie son defends,
That with loud triumph down to bell descends.
BY this, the sable veil of night, from far
Vnsprad; and Phoebus in his golden Carre,
Pricks on the fiery Steeds, that force their way
And make new breach through the Ionian Sea,
Whilst (day yet mask't in night) his flaring beams,
Play with the waves, and mock the blue gods streams,
About this morn peep moment, the lost maid
Lost, for she now by Venus was betrayed,
(Unmindful of her mothers strict command)
For who can stricter Destinies with-stand?
Boldly awakes, forgets all fear or doubt,
And to the dewy fields she sallies out;
Out went she, but no sooner tripped over
The humble threshold, when her creaking door,
With turned hinge thrice squeak't; as if it meant
To warn her from the desperate attempt.
Thrice it presaged, thrice (guilty of her fate)
The neighboring Aetna groaned: but ah, too late!
For headlong will of woman, now, in her,
Rebellion nourished' against iuster fear.
Out went she, and with her the sisters three,
Those goddesses, that bore her company;
First iocund Venus hugged with her deceit,
Glad, that the hour for which she long did wait
Drew near; but giaddest that her powerful skill
Could draw the powers infernal to her will.
The smooth-comb'd locks, that (on her golden head
She wears) part (like two skeines) and as in thread
Entangled, some crumples up: so she
Some longer wore, some crispt and curled be;
In a rich purple mantle was she clad,
Over which, a belt (her sweating husband had
Framed in his Forge) she cast, which kept it on,
Buckled ther'to with a rich Orient stone:
Next Venus marched Licoeus beauteous queen:
She (whom the Arcadian Swains full often have seen
Fell their wild Bores; and she) whose stately lance
Pandions Towr's protects, who does advance
The Cities Trophies: this, in strife and jar
Bestirres her self (best pleased with bloody war.
The other (a bold huntresse) loves to fright
The wildest beasts that tremble at her sight.
Carved on a golden Helmet, Pallas bore
Huge Typhons picture, (whom she long before
Slew in Jove's quarrel:) Typhons upper part
Is dead, the lower living; so in part
He lives, part dies, that monstrous bulk of his,
Half man, half serpent, upward, down-ward is
In her right hand a mighty spear she wields,
That towers up to the sky, no wood that yields
A tree so tall; and in her left hand, graced
With dazzling shield was ugly Gorgon placed,
Crowned with a head of snakes, whose visage grim
And killing look, she with a veil keeps in.
Dian appears in a more mild aspect,
More lovely, and in every respect
So like her brother, that each silver ray,
(Upon her glorious head) shined it (by day)
Were Phoebus self: whose light, whose eminence
She bore (Sex only breeding difference)
Her azure plumpe vein'd arms discovered bare,
And careless locks played with the gentle air.
Th'vnbended bow now gave her sinews rest,
And at her back the shafts in quiver rest:
A short loose garment that she (fastened) wears
With double girt, scarce from her knee appears;
On whose light ground (unmatched to behold)
The wandering Delos floats in seas of gold:
With these, the joy of Ceres, her dear child,
But soon, near grief, keeps equal pace in field,
Equal in limbs and honor, and might seem
Either of both; for every one would deem
He saw a goddess, and would think her so,
Bore she but Pallas shield, or Phoebus bow:
Her gathered garment fastened with a knot
By smoothest Jasper was; and she was not
Inferior to the Sisters nor their skill,
For she could cousen Natures self (at will)
With art, which never happ'lier was shown,
Then in the rare bestowing of her comb,
On those two golden fleeces, that adorn
Her wel-shap't head; where they so even were worn
That not the finest thread in loome of Lawne
Agreed, or could more equally be drawn:
Th'Imagery in silks so lively wrought
On her loose robe, might please the very thought
Of nice beholders; who, when they should see
These pictures, and would judge them but to be,
Inanimate dead trunkes, might Proserpine
Prick them but tongues, they would speak and be divine.
The bults she workt were of a goddess breed,
(Resembling Sun and Moon Hyperions seed)
But in their shapes she fashioned different quite,
These two great Captains of Aurora 'nd Night:
Such, as when Thetis (they but tender, young,
Short breathed Infants) with a Nurse-like song
Rock't sleep into their cradles, and does take
To her warm lap those sucklings when they wake;
Tytan, thus weak: (in his minority)
Dim lighted, and not clamber'd up so high
(As now) with mounting wing; in which first age
Men feign him mild, and free from scorching rage:
Thus, feeble Tytan, at his Dammes right side
Lay panting; and as often as he cried,
(For wantonness) so ever and anon
It sobb's, and spits a gentle fire, upon
The loving Mother; who to still and rest,
Turns to his sister her left side and breast:
From whence, and at her Cristall dugge, she drinks
That milke-sweet liquor, whilst her Sire bethinks
Him of the younglings: and the pretty Moon
Viewes in the Mothers arm, unto her soon;
He (sporting) calls, the wayward babe, that shows
With one eye turned upward, that it knows
Naught but the dugge and Thetis, all else scorns,
Mockes him (kind father) with her little horns.
In such great pomp, glittering attire, she went:
The Naides (on both sides of her) bent
In friendly troop, to wait and bear her train,
Compass her round, each strove to be most feign.
Those Nymphs Crymnisus, which thy fountain clear
And thine Pantagia (whose swift course does bear,
And headlong roll down rocks:) do famous make
That River too from whence Gela does take
The Cities name, and they (slow Camarine)
Which in those fennie shallow lakes of thine
Are nourished; those that in Crystal brook,
And streams of Arethusa, all forsook
Their loved homes; and to make full the feast
Alpheus sends his Nymphs, and amongst the rest
That there attend in grateful company,
None did excel the fairest Cyane.
So Amazones in a triumphant band
With sloped shields march through the foe-mans land:
When man-like brave Hyppolita, with spoil
(From Arcton hill, laden with goods and toil)
Retires her snowy troops; then, when they sweat
In blood of yellow Scythians, or beat,
And break with sharpest axe the tougher Ice
That stops the current of swift Tanais:
So, the Moeonian Nymphs are wont to rise
From Hermus, when their used solemnities
They give to Bacchus, on whose festival
Each, severally, and then, together, all
Upon their fathers gold swollen banks run mad,
Frisking about: the aged river (glad)
Sits in his den, and as their want he viewes
Water in plenty from moist vrne renewes;
No sooner had flow'r-bearing Aetna spied,
And from his hearby top far off descri'd
The sacred people; when mild Zepherus
He forces with entreates, and urges thus:
Thou grateful (wished for father) of the Spring,
That'bout my meadows (with lascivious wing)
Fly'st, and there reign'st, that with perpetual blast
Bedew'st the ground, make it with freshness last:
Look yonder, look upon those Nymphs that play
('Among whom) the thund'rers plants to sport this day,
Daigne midst my walks; be thou propitious,
Be present with thy odoriferous
Sweet flowr's, now to their fullness blow them forth,
Ripen the blossoms and those sprouts of worth,
That fertile Hybla may at length confess
(But envy) that her fuitfulnesse is less.
What ever sents the dry Arabia
Breathes from her spices on the morning gray;
What odours flattering sense Hydaspes sends
From far; what ere the rare bird (that extends
Her flight to swartie Indians (there can find
That (though she want a mate) can raise her kind
From her own death and ashes, and renewes
Past years with youth: sweet Zephirus infuse
The sum and all into these veins, and blow
With fullest cheeks: cherish these fields, that so
I may deserve the touch divine, and pure
Of goddess finger; and so far allure
Those heavenly powers, they may be covetous
To wear our flowery garlands on their brows:
Here Aetna stopped, when straight the West-wind threw
Shook (from his madid wings) a Nectar new
On the dry turfes, and ioines the clefted-earth,
Begets in it a second fruitful birth:
Where e're he flies a Spring of April showers
Follows; the ground swells up with herbs and flowers,
Which with their load (the moisture quickly spent)
Bend down again, and (fading) lose their sent.
This place he clotheth with the bloud-bright Rose,
That, with young Hyacinthus, there bestows
The purple-painted (near black) Violet.
What belt on Parthian King was ever set
In richer Iemmes? what more variety
In fleeces spotted with Assyrian dye?
The Bird of Juno in his greatest pride,
Shows but dull eyes (with these fair colors tried:)
Not so (when watrish winter does begin)
The Rainbow crowns him with often varying,
When streaking the pale Sun with redder fire
The moystned tracke, through clouds disperc't shows clear:
The place exceeds the flowers: for a plain
Here crooking swells; there, seems to rise again
In hillockes soft, till, farther it becomes
A hill, where from a lively punice runs
A bubling Spring, which grows into a Brook,
From which it is moisture the dew'd grass does suck;
For (as the Snake-like stream winds in and out)
It snares the herbs and flowers round about:
The Woods cool leaves here serve for summers shade,
(By whose thick boughs VVinters cold frost's allayd)
Where grows the Fur, the hard strong Cherrie-tree
For ships, for bows (in war) that fittest be:
Jove's loved Oak, young, and in vigorous heat,
The old, with luscious honey combs repleat:
The mournful Cypress covering sepulcher,
And Bay presaging Laurel tree grew there:
The thicke-topt, spreading, crisped Box, (whose weight)
Does make it wave, and totter from it is height:
The Serpent-like slow Yuie, and the Elm
Lac't with the Vine, makes it with Grapes o're-whelme.
A Lake which the Sicilians, Pergus name,
Was near at hand; and to adorn the same,
A row of well-plac't trees begirt it round,
Whose silent water (free from noise or sound)
Looks pale, and suffers the beholders eyes
(Unhurt) to search the bottomes secresies.
The train be'ing here arrived they joy and sport
To see the flowery Country, to exhort,
Thus, Cytherea, them begins: Come, come,
Sisters, and gather till the morning Sun
Dry the airs sweat, whilst yet my Lucifer
(Mounted on dewy Courser) every where
Waters the yellow fields: so, having spoke,
She first began to pluck a flower, first took
The badge of her old grief, then each does strive
And fall to work; as when of Bees a Hiue
Snatches the sweets of Hyblas Time; or when
Their Leaders with an Army (as amongst men)
Remove their waxen tents: or, when they creep
From hollow Beeches womb, and (swarming) sweep
The dustie air; when (swollen with their cropped store)
(Buzzing) they seem to grumble yet for more.
So they made havoc of the flowers, and spoil
Of all their glory, in a moments toil.
The Lilly to the darker Violet
One weaues; another in her breast does set
The soft-sweet Marioram; a third must go
Starre-deckt with Roses; this in differing show
Prankes up her self with Priuet white, and thee
They gather, and thy weeping Tragedy
(Poor Hyacinth) renew; nor do they spare
Narcissus (both of you now branches rare
Of the fresh spring, and in your lives, the joys
Of Nature, two most excellent sweet boys)
Thee the tiles error struck, but thee, thine own;
When in the fountain that self-love was known:
Apollo, with sad brow thy loss laments;
At thine Cephissus broken reed relents:
Proserpina, more greedy then the rest
(Most hot upon the spoil) culs out the best,
And stuffes her Osier baskets full; that smile
To see their Mistress the poor fields beguile
Of their rich habit; she with garlands crowns
Her temples (ignorant of fate) that frowns
Upon the wreath she wears (prophetical
Swiftly fore-running the black Nuptial)
The warlike Goddess, her right hand, that scowres
The lusty troops, that tears down walls and towers,
Gives to an easier task; lays by her spear
Her glist'ring shield (vnus'd such toys to bear)
She teaches now the garland to embrace,
Her steele-topp't helmet sweetest garlands grace:
Nor she, that in Parthenian Mountains seeks
With sure nosed senters after chase, dislikes
The sport, but her licentious locks keeps down,
And bridles them with a fair garland crown:
Whilst thus the scattered Virgins pull the flowers,
Behold a noise 'gan bellow, as if two towers
(Falling) had rush't together, or some Town
From it is foundations firm had bin cast down,
The cause none gest, but Paphos goddess: she
Was preinstructed in the mystery,
And had this double passion at her choice
To fear with them, but inwardly rejoice:
And now the rector of the damned, below;
Through secret windings bustles to and fro,
To find a way to earth: first does he fetch
A compass here and there; then makes a breach
Aloft; his foggy Coursers trample on
Enceladus, that with their weight does groan,
(The Giants huge vaste limbs cut by their wheels)
Adds to the former torments that he feels;
And laboring, with a double yoke, in pain:
(For he bears Dis and Aetna now) would feign
Find ease; the weary Serpents (clinging) stay
Their axletree, the horses force their way,
And scudde along (too swift for them too slack)
Their fiery wheels slide from his sulfurous back.
And as the close besieger, by degrees
Steals on his mu'd up foe, that naught foresees,
Whilst he (by a laborious countermine
And secret) the mocked walls does undermine;
Whose strength and stricter guard none now protect,
(The Conqu'rours entering, where they least expect)
Like to these earth-borne men. Saturnes third heir
Contriues a passage up to the World's air
His brothers Orb, and gives his Steeds free reine
Searches through every corner: but (in vain)
No gate appears, huge heaps of rokces and stones
Damme up his passage every where; not once
Discou'ring light, as purposely to keep
The god close prisoner in that dungeon deep;
But he (enraged) brook't no delays, and straight
Advanced his beamy scepter, with whose weight
He breaks the Rocks; tears the resisting ground,
The blow caused all Sicilia's Caves resound,
And Rivers rore; th'adiacent Islands shake,
Amazed Vulcane sudden flight does take,
(Leaving his forge) the trembling Cyclop's hide
Their fearful heads, and cast Jove's bolts aside;
The poor cold dweller on steep Appenine,
And frozen passengers, that slowly climb
The hoary Alps, amazed stand, and doubt
Of some new broile 'twixt Jove and Giant rowt:
Those that (along thy streams) with naked limb
Perpetual trophie bearing Tyber, swim,
And those that to thy current famous Po
Launch out their little barks, heard that great blow:
So when (on lower Plains of Thessalie)
A standing poole (by rockie Mountains high
Enclosed) denies unto the marish ground
Tillage; and pasture to the meadows drowned;
Till angry Neptune with his Tridents pikes,
Pierces high Ossa, and cold Olympus strikes;
Whose wounded sides open a passage wide,
At which the imprisoned waters (loos'ned) slide,
The Floods unto the Sea, and drier land
Restored are, unto the Husbandman.
No sooner was Earths knotty veil undone
(By Pluto) when Trinacria begun
To spread her large and opening womb; and now
A sudden fright, upon the pallid brow
Of heaven appears; the stars vnus'd to stray
From their first course, seek an uncertain way:
The two celestial Bears that shone so bright
In the forbidden Sea dash their dim light.
Lazy Boots fear does headlong cast,
Orion trembles, Atlas stands aghast
At hels Iades neighing, whose breath, misty steams
Obscure heavens face, and Phoebus golden beams;
His radiant brightness in the beasts does breed
A sudden terror, for they use to feed
Perpetually in darkness: now by fits,
Betwixt their teeth they catch the champed bits,
And (winding sidelong) their Coach beam would turn
Backward to hell, and Chaos to return.
But when they once the Tarry whip perceive
Lash their black buttockes, quickly then they leave
Their strife; and (forced to the new light) depart
Swifter then winter flood, or Parthian dart:
The violence of Southern storms is slow
To their quick pace, that nimblest thoughts outgoe:
The reins grow hot with their rank blood, and breath
From furnace of their nostrils sends pale death
Into the purer air: their froth, upon
Th'vntroden sands leaves strong infection.
The Nymphs all fled, save Proserpine; (who caught
And snatched into the Chariot) besought
The goddesses with screaking loud for aid;
Pallas that viewes her (how she was betrayed)
Discouers Gorgons visage; Delta too
To her relief hastens the horne-bent bow:
Nor give they way unto their Uncle, for
Joint Charity incites them to this war,
Virginity in them and Proserpine
(Alike) exasperates the fault and crime
Of the bold rauisher; he keeps his way
(Fearelesse:) as when the Lion makes a prey
On some young Steer the beauty of the stall
And herd, when with his paws besmeared all
In blood, he dives into the naked breast
Until his rau'nous hunger there suppressed,
Quarters out more, at length his appetite
Quite slak't (with staring gaze that would affright)
He careless stands, shaking his knotted maine
(As if the Herdsmans threats he did disdain.)
Thou ruler of the sluggish Orb, thou worst
(Quoth Pallas) of thy brothers; thou accursed:
What Furies with their whips and brands profane
Have moved thee? that (thy kingdom left in vain)
Thou dare pollute the earth: Away, begone:
Chuse'mongst thy Dirae a Companion
Worthy thy bed; thy brothers kingdom leave
And do not others of their lot bereave:
Back to thy night, why minglest thou the dead
To livers? why (a stranger) do thou tread
Upon our Globe? She thus exclaimes, and wounds
The horn-hoof'd steeds (making them keep their bounds
With her opposed shield) they stop, and she
With vprear'd lance was ready to let flee
Against the Chariot, had not Heavens King
(In sign of Truce) bowed his red thund' ring Wing
(Acknowledging his son) and from above
The gaping Clouds, does Hymen reapproue
The eternal Knot; and with their blazing light,
His flames, are witnesses to Pluto's right:
The Goddesses forbore, Cinthia her Bow
Vnbends, but adds these words unto her woe.
Be mindful (ah farewell) the just respect
Of father, has deni'de us to protect
Thy person, nor can we in arms withstand
Him, that inflicts on us his dread command:
Thy Sire is bent against thee, thou must go
Unto those silent people (there below;)
(Alas poor Virgin) and shall never see
Thy sisters more, nor equal company.
What fate? what fortune from above thee bears
(Dooming the stars unto perpetual tears)
No more my Nets shall bout Parthenian Cave
Be spread, no more will I my Quiver have;
And now securely may the wilder Boar
Foame, and the raging Lion freely roar:
Taygetus and Arcadia shall bewail
Thee; when my hunting them begins to fail,
Sad Cynthus-will bemoane thy destiny,
And Delfo's Oracle must silent be:
Whilst thus she mournes, the woeful Proserpine
(Her loose hair scattered to the Southern wind)
(In swift*drawne Chariot wringing her soft hands
On sorrow-beaten breast) these vain demands
Powr's against heaven: why? ah why (quoth she)
Didd'st thou not (father) cast thy darts at me
By hands of Cyclops made? and not expel
Thy daughter hence in dismal shades to dwell?
No love of father? could no pity move
What fault of mine has thus incenst great Jove?
When Phlegra raged in sudden tumults, I
No Banner waued' against their enemy,
The gods; nor then by strength of mine at all
Did frosty' Olympus on cold Ossa fall:
What mischief have I practiced? of what fault
Made guilty? am I banished to hells Vault,
Vaste opening jaws? happy, oh happy they,
Whom other Rauishers have made their prey,
And borne with them! at least in their annoy
The common light, the Sunshine such enjoy:
But I; Heaven, Earth, Virginity must leave,
The Stygian king does me of shame bereave:
Oh ill loved flowers, mocked Parents counsels ill,
Sad trial learned (too late) of Venus skill!
My dearest Mother, whether Lydian song
In Vale of Ida, thee detain thus long:
Or, whether thou to Dyndimus be gone
To bloody sacrifice, there (looking on
Cybels mad Priests, that with their drawn swords roame
About those hills:) make haste and quickly come
To my relief: succor my frantic grief,
Hold in the loose raines of this cruel thief.
He at these words, and seemly mourning grew,
A stronger melting passion to renew;
And with his sooty garment dries her tears
(Temp'ring with mildest voice her cause-lesse fears:)
Cease, sweetest Proserpine, to vex thy mind
With vain laments, a husband thou shall find
Worthy thy love; know, we are Saturnes son,
That over all things bear dominion:
Nor think that thou the gladsome day have lost,
Since we of stars and purer light may boast;
When thou the Elizian brightness shall admire,
And happy souls free from tormenting fire,
Where the more precious golden age does keep
(In an eternal quiet lul'd asleep:)
Where Zephirus, fair flowr's of richest worth
Breathes out (such as thy Aetna never brought forth)
Where in the shadie Groves a rich tree grows,
Whose arched boughs the golden Apple shows,
That consecrate I to thee, and will make
A happy lasting Autumn for thy sake:
What e're the liquid air, what Aeolus
Contains (my lovely queen shall be for us,
Earth, Seas and Rivers, all that in them live,
To thy commands shall their obeisance give,
The rich-clad purple kings shall humbly fall
Before thy throne (mixed with the poor) for all
Death equals; thou the guilty and unjust
Shall judge, with them, the Innocent and Just,
Those shall bewail their crimes, these shall be blessed
By thee, and sent into eternal rest:
The Destinies upon thy will shall wait,
And what thou orderest be held for fate
Immovable: (this said) they now drew near
Hell gates, he entered with unusual cheer.
Like shaken leaves in saplesse Autumn cast,
From trees to earth, by furious Southern blast,
Or rainie drops in a thick Cloud or sand,
By broken waves cast up into the land:
The damned souls in thronging multitude,
To view their queen, boldly themselves intrude:
At entrance of his Lords great Phlegeton
Arises, and from boiling streams, upon
His bristled beard casts moisture, and that face
All on a flame: the Fiends, each to his place
And several office them address; some choose
To set the Chariot up, whilst others loose
Th'vnharnest couples (turning them to graze
On their known pastures, black Cocytus lays:
Part deck the Palace with rich Tapistrie
(Set out with curious wrought Imagerie:)
Part dressed the windows with fresh flowers; within,
The Nuptial bed, others with Cou'rings trim:
The Elizian Matrons round begirt their queen
In a chaste troop (whose tender sorrow seen
By sweet words eased) they order her loose hair,
And hide with flaming veil the shame-fac't fair
The Region pale and bleak, wanne ghosts now free,
Doc frolic in triumphant iollity;
(Dark silence interrupted) loud they sing,
And horrid peales with noise (undaunted) ring
Hels groans now ceast, and (filth of ugly night
Disperc't) she is rarifi'd with purer light:
Minos no more casts lotts, the souls condemned
Of their dilated pains now find an end;
No lash resounds; Ixion from his wheel
Is loos'ned, and (refresht) does comfort feel:
Poor Tantalus the envious water sippes,
And tast's the fruit erst mocked his thirsty lips:
Tytius vaste limbs are raised from the ground,
(Where he nine Acres covered) and unbound,
(The rau'nous Vulture from his panting breast
Dissolved) laments (as a forbidden guest:)
The Furies now forgetful of their rage,
With softest notes, their strict revenge assuage,
Huge goblets they prepare, and drink a fill
Of wine, in which their monstrous locks they swil;
To the Cerastes power carowses deep,
(Whilst with new light still burning fresh they keep
The festival spent Torches:) now, you take
A safer flight over Auernus Lake
(Then erst) you birds; (still wont to sacrifice
Your selves to vapors thick that thence arise.)
(Amsanctus current swift now stopped) the noise
Ceas't, boiling Acheron 'gan loud rejoice,
That his hot waves (turned to a fountain) run
Cool streams of milk; which, they had never done
Till now; And now Cocytus flourishing
(All clad in Yuie) offers to hells king
A standing Poole, and of Lyaeus store,
Of sacred liquor. Atropos forbore
(In sign of triumph now) with cruel hand
Life's thread to cut: at Plutos dire command
Death stops his progress, now no tears are spent,
Nor Kindred, Kindreds Funerals lament:
The Sea man scapes all storms; the Soldier, he
Securely fights (from shot and sharp pike free;)
Free from contagion healthy Cities are,
Free from the plagues of famine, sickness, war:
Old Charon crowned with reedsbetwixt each shore
Keeps singing time with stroke of idle Oar:
The Eu'ning Hesperus (descending) fled
To th'Orbes below: now to her Nuptial bed
The Virgin's brought, starre-painted night looks on
As (witness) to the marriage: she, upon
Them both showers happy blessings to ensue
From this eternal union, and a crew
Of blessed Elizian Saints thus sweetly sing,
Presaging notes to their fair Queen and King.
Our Mother Juno, and of thundering Jove
(Thou Son in law, and brother) may all love
Beget soft rest unto you both; and knit
Those mutual necks in your embraces fit.
A prosperous race grows toward now; and glad
Nature expects more gods: oh may you add
New deities, new powers to hells affairs,
Make Ceres Grandam to your wished heirs.
Finis Libri Secundi.
THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.
The Argument of the Third Book.
Jove calls a Synod of the gods, reueales
His will: each of them, secretly, concealcs
The rape, from Ceres unto Phrigia gone,
She dreams, returns home (her loss being known)
Against gods sh'exclaimes (enraged) the world about
Searches with lights her daughter to find out.
Whilst hell thus triumphs, Jupiter above
Commands Thaumantis (girt with clouds to move,
And summon up the powers of earth and seas,
(Clad all in red) she downward slides, with ease,
On Zephires wings; the gods, the Sea Nymphs all,
And rivers, from their humid dens does call:
('Twixt fear and doubt they rowse themselves) but muse
What new occasion, or what sudden news
Disturbes their quiet rest; and (being come
To heavens Star Chamber) each their proper room
And place provided have, with order fit;
In the first rank the gods Celestial sit:
And in the second, the Sea powers are placed,
Calm Nereus, and aged Phorcus, graced
With comely hoarinesse; (next these, biform'd
Glaucus was set, and Proteus (vntransform'd)
In his own shape: the ancient and great
Rivers were honored with a seu'rall seat;
But thousand lesser Brooks (as was most meet
For youth) like common rowt stood on their feet:
The VVater-Nymphes, each, to her liquid Sire
Leanes, and dumb gazing Fawns, heavens stars admire.
Then the grave father from Olympus high
Thus spoke, and breathed forth this mystery:
At length, the care of man's affairs, again
Solicites me, which, since the lazy reign
Of idle Saturn long neglected were;
When we perceived how men secure from fear,
Lay steep't and buried in my fathers sloth,
Then to give further suff'rance we were loath:
But (willing to reform the same in part)
Spurred up invention, and gave reins to Art:
Then were we pleased that the untilled field
(Less liberal) less store of Grain should yield:
That honey in the woods more scarce should grow,
And wine no more from swelling Fountains flow:
Not that we envious were, or basely prone
To poisonous malice; but, when ouer-growne
We plenty saw, and easefull riot, blind
The light of reason, to dissuade mankind
We willing were, dull spirits to revive:
That each man might by his own labor live,
That, sharp necessity should then produce
And bring forth arts (to be brought up by use.)
But Nature urges us (with sad complaint)
To ease poor man (for such a burden faint)
And (having to my charge the Tyrant laid)
With former golden age does us upbraid;
She calls Jove, Miser, says; that she is frank,
Exclaimes, that we, the fields with thistles rank
And to grow barren, suffer: that the year
Does fruitless pass.
That she, (who unto mortals long did vow
Her self Kind mother) is turned Stepdame now*
And thus proceeds: what boots it, wretched man
To have a soul (from heaven infused) that can
Discourse and reason, and his lofty head
Lift up; if he like beasts a life must lead,
(VVandring with them in the wild woods, to get
The fruit of Swinish acorns for his meat?
Is this (says she) to live? with such distaste
The common mother urged, that we; at last
Contented were, she thus much should obtain,
That from Chaonian food her sons abstain;
To which effect, we solemnly decree:
That, Ceres, of her daughters Destiny
Witless (who now with her cursed Damme remains,
Lashing the Idean Lions over those Plains)
With wailefull mourning search the world throughout,
Till (having in the end of her pledge found out)
In sign of her new joy (for old grief past)
Huge heaps of harvest she may from her cast,
From golden Carre, and spread ripe ears of corn
Upon the fields by her blue Dragons borne.
But list, you gods; if any here reveal
The rape of Proserpine; or not conceal
The Rauisher from Ceres, I protest
A general ruin to the peace and rest
Of things; (be he a son, or sister she,
Or wife of mine, or that dear daughter be
That from my brain-pan boasts her birth) shall feel
The stroke of thunder and reuengefull steel
Of Gorgons fury: and though she must live,
(For deities dye not) yet shall she grieve
To have been borne of heaven, and wish for death.
Like punishment my vengeance shall vnsheath
On any of you (Rivers) that withstand
The secrecy of this my strict command:
(By me first wounded) him, my son in law
Repunish shall; this for a sacred law
Established stand: (this said) and past for fate,
The stars were shook, and seat whereon he sat.
And now the apparitions of black night,
And fearful mischief Ceres do affright:
Who (absent from this Synod, and secure)
To her still thought could sweetest rest procure;
But now each moment does ingeminate
Her doubtful fears, and ugly night (as fate)
Whispers the sad mishap of Proserpine,
Who, (in each dream of hers) seems to decline
More from her pristine being; every sleep
Of Ceres, her vexed soul in cares does steep.
So still she groans in night, and when day comes,
Cold wonderment her stupid sense benummes,
Till next night's fantasies, in which; a dart,
One while (her seems) to her daughters heart
Fast'ned appears; and (as a horrid sight)
She loathes her garment changed from chastest white:
The trees that in her walks she long did know
Barren, now fresh (she thinks) and fruitful grow:
But one (amongst them all) she liked best,
Whose shamefac't leaves served for a shade in rest
To Proserpine: the Bay tree that, she sees
Cut from the root, and by strange cruelties
Of art, the boughs lopt off; boughs, that abouud
In freshness, now ly withered on the ground,
And (as she thought) of this great wickedness
Enquiring, woeful Driades express
The lamentable Story; here (say they)
The raging Fiends have made a bloody Fray
With hellish axe; and laid the dust along
Thy laurel green, fresh feeling of it is wrong.
At length, all circumstances, all disguise
Unmasked, poor Ceres her ill fortune spies
In her own child, that now her self appears
Her own forc't-messenger, wet-visage, cleeres
All wau'ring doubts, which (when the goddess wakes)
She puts away, and on her, new grief takes;
For Proserpine appeared, as if she seemed
Shut in close prison, and her mother deemed
Her fettered with strong shackles, not as she
Was left by her in fruitful Stcilie;
Nor (as the goddesses her found, when they
In Aetnas rosy valleys her astray
Did lead, but now; those locks she might behold
(VVhilome surprissing ambar and fair gold
In brightness) squallid black, the sparkling light
Fire of her eyes, extinguished is by night,
A night of sorrow, and that blushing red
Upon her cheek (exhaust with cold) grown dead.
The Rubies, of her well graced lips quite spent,
And limbs, then snow erst whiter, with the sent
And color of hels pitch, defiled, to view
Of Ceres, were so strange, she scarce her knew:
Yet, seeing her so changed: goods! what a sight
Is here (says she?) what bitter woeful plight?
What fault? what punishments are these? what face?
What macerated monster of disgrace
Is this? (she adds:) who thus has power (she cries)
Has power thus much on us to tyrannize?
Why bear thou these bonds, this chain, unfit
For wild beasts? Do thy soft arms merit it?
Art thou (quoth she) my child, or dream I, art mine?
When the vex't Image of poor Proserpine
Replied with terror: Mother, oh, thou blind
Mother; oh thou to thy lost child unkind
Could thou (more cruel then the Lions) whom
Thou kept'st in awe, so long thy coming home
Defer; and me that was thine only dear,
So long forget, was I despised? then hear
A doleful truth, that name of Proserpine
So sweet to thee; so loved, so only thine,
Only that name remains: for, see, behold
What punishment, what bonds do me infold:
But (cruel) thou in uproar with a song
Through Phrigian Cities hurri'st, and of wrong
To me art witless; yet, if mothers breast
Have not quite lest thee: if thou yet, it blessed
And holy Ceres bear the name, let me
Beg one boon at thy hands (my liberty:)
Carry me up again, but if too late
I strive against Jove, and my prefixed fate:
If back I never must return; yet thou,
At least, with comfortable visit now
Come see me: thus she spoke, and going about
To stretch her hands, she could not hold them out,
(So clogged with yr'ns) that (as she vanished) shook:
(At which noise) Ceres fearfully awoke,
Glad, that the vision had no trewer proved,
But sorry for the want of her beloved;
Up straight she gets in a distracted mood,
And to Cybele does her griefs unload:
No longer (sacred Parent) can I stay
In Phrigian ground; the care calls me away
Of dearest child, she is yet a Girl and young,
Knows not the danger of a flattering tongue:
Her tender years unto all hazard yet
Do her expose, nor do those buildings great
And trusty, of the Cyclops, me assure:
Each blast of fame, does make me less secure
Of safety (lest she to the gods reveal
My secret house) nor can the Isle conceal
My daughters being there (it being a place
So famous) and withal th'apparent blaze
Of Aetna, and Enceladus deep groans
Cannot be hid, nor silenced his moanes.
My boading dreams in sundry uncouth forms
Presage, and every dream sends fresh alar'mes
Of doubts unto me, my Propheticke thought
Still threatens, and has still upon me wrought.
As often as the crown of golden ears
Falls from my head often self, up get my fears
As often, and stir the blood that on my breast
Stands in a sweat, whilst I (perplexed) no rest
Can take: then on a sudden do arise
Two streams, that break from my unwilling eyes,
My rebel hand does beat my trembling heart,
When I would touch my pipe (it seems) all Art
And sweetness fails; that nothing does remain
But the dead sound, and (being in this vain)
My Tymbrel's strokes, naught but sad sounds forth send;
All things (I fear) my griefs to come portend:
Delay is dangerous, such words (replies
Cybele) may they frustrate mount the skies;
Ioue's not so slack: but (to her latest end)
With thunder, will be ready to defend
His pledge; but thou thy journey onward haste,
And back return, when thy false feare's ore'past:
Ceres takes leave, the Temple leaves, and set
Upon her Chariot) thinks the Dragons yet
Are dull and lazy, with her lash that rings
In the air, belabours their alternate wings:
Towered Sicilie she drives amain, and scant
Over Ida, but despaires, suspects her want.
As a poor bird (of tender young bereft,
Who to some tree or lower hedge were left,
Whilst she prepared them food; ever from whence
Her flight she takes, a kind of troubled sense,
Tender remorse she has: first, lest the wind
Her nest blow down; next, lest she empty find
The same (to men or Snakes a prey) so she,
So Ceres, when she saw the custody
Fail, and the watch-folke of her house all gone,
The posts broke up, hinges cast down, upon
Her out-roomes desolate; with such a sight
And unexpected change, all in a fright
Her clothes she rent, and from her soft hair tears
The sprigges and it; this madness dried her tears,
Nor had she breath to speak; but having spent
With trembling, all her spirits (as she went
Forward) the first step was a stumble still,
Yet on she goes, and with a madding will
VVanders about, to view these empty rooms:
(As she from one into another comes)
On a disordered frame at length she lights,
The worker well she knew, but poorly slights
Th'imperfect piece, for (the divine work, spied)
She found, that the bold Spider had supplied
With sacrilegious web, that empty space:
Yet she nor wept, nor grieved; but kissed the place
And cloth unfinished, upon those threads
She spends her dumb complaints, and thinks she reads
Her daughter, on those faces: every toy
About the scattered rooms, does she enjoy
And hug for Proserpine: now the chaste couch
And forlorn bed inuites her to approach,
Which sluttishly (unmade) seems to complain
For want of the soft weight it did sustain.
Amazed she stands, (struck dumb, in such distress
Like a poor Swain, or simple Shepherdess,
(Whose flock, whilst she was far from their relief
To Afric Lions rage, or cunning thief,
Exposed) too late can she return, and calls
The beasts (in vain) within their hurdle walls;
So Ceres: and in the utmost room she spied
Electra, Nurse unto her child, a tried
Servant of hers; and of the Ocean
The most known ancient Nymph (from whence she came.
Like Ceres self, in goodness; this was she
That Proserpine from tender infancy
Bore at her breast; and, till she went alone,
Was used for sport, Jove's thigh to set her on.
This her Companion was, her Guard select,
Whom (next her Mother) she would most respect.
When her thus Ceres found, robbed of her trust,
With hoarie locks now scattered in the dust,
(After a volley of loud sighs) the reins
To grief she loosens, and breathes out her pains:
What sack is this (said she?) And are we given
A prey to Titans host? Reigns Jove in Heaven?
(The Thund'rer living) who durst be so bold?
Who durst commit this outrage, vncontrol'd?
Typhoeus, Alcyoneus, have these
Broke from the Mountains, given their yoakt-necks ease?
Or has my neighbor Aetna, Enceladus
Freed? Or my household gods, Briareus
And seat destroyed? Ah, where art thou (my Dear)
Those handmaids that attended on thee, where?
Where, where is Cyane? what violence,
My chanting Sirens, has removed you hence?
Is this your faith? is this your loyalty,
To keep another Pledge from danger free?
The poor Nurse trembled, and her grief gave place
To stronger fear; not to have seen the face
Of woeful Ceres, she would gladly'haue died:
Senseless, amazed, a while she does abide,
(As loath the doubtful mischief to disclose)
Until at length, dispensing with her woes
And passions, thus she spoke: I would the mad
And raging Army of the Giants had
Been actors in this mischief; common things
Do less affect us, sorrow that most wrings
Is that which by our nearest friends is sought,
And such is thine, for goddesses have wrought,
Conspired thy ruin, nay (which least of all
Thou migh'tst suspect) sisters, did cause our fall:
The trech'rous gods and wounds here behold
Ofenui'ous kindred, that their bloods have sold.
Phlegra against heaven was never so furious,
As heaven against thee (all vnpropitious)
Thy house a happy quiet did possess,
While the chaste Virgin never would express
A thought of gadding, or scarce once bestow
Her dainty foot (one only step to go
Over the threshold) neither durst she make
A sally to the fields, fresh air to take.
So strict she was to thy commands, so bent
To herlou'd work: at which (though tired and spent)
All the delight and solace she desired
Was, from her Sirens songs and notes admired.
I was her bosom friend, she would impart
To me, the joys or sorrows of her heart;
I was her bedfellow, and to each sport
(As a companion should I still resort:)
Thus past we fairly on, till Venus came
Drawn hither (doubtful) by what blast of fame;
And that she might the less suspected be,
Phoebe and Pallas are her company:
With cunning smiles, and feigned embraces soft
She often hugges thy daughter, and as often
The name of sister iterates; complains,
On her hard Mother: that so much restraines
Her, from wished liberty; and thinks it strange
That thou abroad so far from home could range,
And leave her in this solitary place;
Far from her fathers kingdom, that the face
Of heaven scarce she sees: and (that which most
Does pity move, her conversation lost
With kindred gods) the simple Maid gave care
(Caught by this wily chat, and free from fear)
The goddesses she makes her welcome ghests,
Whom, with quaint cates and Nectar store she feasts:
The banquet done in sport and merriment
She wore Diana's robe, and her bow bent
With tender finger drew; and sought to wield
Minerua's golden headpiece, and huge shield:
But Venus, straight, deceitfully' began praise
Aetna's high top, and to the skies to raise
The Valleys flowers, and something her admired,
Of which, she wittingly, witless inquired:
She could not think, or easily believe
The Rose, from all those frosts preserved, should live:
Or that the colder Months should there retain
The Summers grass, all winter to remain;
Nor, that the tender blossoms of the Spring
Are nip't, by ang'ry Boots blustering:
(Thus praising and thus doubting) with desire
To see the place, her breast was set on fire;
Thy tender Virgins frail, unwary years
Made her consent to go, t'encrease my fears.
What tears spent I, to hinder her (in vain?)
How little did my'ntreaties (fruitless) gain
From her? that (now resolved and confident)
In sisters guard (together with them went?)
And (a large train of Nymphs to attend them seen
Unto the Meadows clothed in lasting green)
With the first morning light, when as the field
Yet chill with dew, heavens liquid juice does yield
To bank of Violets; they gathered there
The moyst'ned flowers, that, with perle drops appear:
But when the Sun grew to the mid-dayes height,
The Pole was ceaz'd on, by vnlook't-for night:
The trembling Island then began to reele
And nod (shook by the noise of Chariot wheel,
Of horses neighing) nor could it appear
(Whether the Coachman Deaths forerunner were,
Or death her self:) the grass and rivers great
Were dried, the fields, straight burnt with parching heat:
All things were blasted; there, the Priuet white
We saw, the Rose and Lilly altered quite
From native sent and color: every flower
The pestilent contagion blasteth over:
And (as the hoarse fell steers-man turned again,
With horrid outcries of each beast the rain)
Back with the hell-blacke Chariot returns night,
And to the World the day-restored light
Discouers our sad loss and heaviness:
For now no Proserpine, nor goddesses
Were seen; for she dear soul was rapt away,
And they (that act performed) made no stay:
Poor Cyane upon the Meddow ground
Struck dead, with cold amazement next we found;
And (as she lay) the garland from her browe.
We took, whose fresher flowers were withered now
With the hot steame: there each of us enquires,
And of our Mistress hap to know desires
Of her (who nearest was to the success)
Each of us with uncertain doubtfulnesse
Demands the color of the Steeds, and who
The Coachman was; but she (that melts in woe)
Nothing replies, of nothing us resolves:
But (metamorphos'd) secretly dissolues
Her self into a Fountain; that soft hair
Upon her head, her feet new turned are
Into a dew; those arms diffused grow
In streams, that (following our footsteps) o're-flow.
The rest fled, and our Mer-mayds with swift wing
Trudge to Pelorus, and (for grief) to sing,
Since, cease: and now (in stead of melody)
Plagues they portend, and dire mortality;
And their soft voices now serve but t'entice
Th'vnheedy Mariner, that in a trice
(Answ'ring their calls) finds his unhappy end;
Of all thy servants, I alone to attend
Thy sorrows live: Ceres in deep suspense,
(Fool that she was) hoped that yet no offense
Was past, and still to come; but by and by
That mood she changes, and (with fi'ry eye
Turned in her head, her breast enraged) above
Up to the gods she flings (with plaints to move)
As a fierce Tygresse, when her den's forlorn
Of tender young, (by fearful horseman borne
To Persian king, madding) out strips the wind;
(Dispersing all her rage, and fury blind
In shining spots:) at length she ouertakes
The Hunter, and with yawning wide mouth makes
Him leave his prey; but in a shape of glass
He coozens the poor beast, and safe does pass
Onward his way: the enraged Mother thus
Throughout all heaven storms: restore to us
Restore, sh'exclaimes; we are no wandering brood
Of some base River, nor Plebeian blood
Of Driades flows from us; Saturn high
Begot me on the tow'ry Cybele:
Where is the privilege of gods then? where
You gods, of those drad laws the sacred fear?
What boots a virtuous life, or what? the fair
Title of good, if Cytherea dare,
If shameless she presume to show that face
(Vnmask't by Lemnian nets, to her disgrace?)
That wholesome sleep, the couch, those twynings chaste
Of her and Mars, made her thus bold at last
With me and mine: since when (no marvel) though
Such deeds, and such base actions from her flow:
But what? are you turned Pandoresses, your;
Dian and Pallas, that yet never knew
What lust meant? Is your maiden honor gone?
Are your vows changed, that thus you waited on
Venus and her bold Ruffian? (suffice:)
You both deserved the bloody sacrifice
Of thirsty Scythian altar: let me know
The reason of your rage; what moved you so
Against Proserpine? did she in word or thought
Offend you ever, had she ever sought
Texpell thee, Delia, from thy groves? or e're
Did she, Tritonia, thy strong arms bear.
Or was sh'offenfiue in her speech? or rude,
(Her self into your dances to intrude?)
Oh no: Trinacria was her loved home,
She never stirred, never from thence would roame:
But what auail'd such priuacie? no day,
No time, could keep your envious eyes away:
Thus she the goddesses (that silent were,
Awed by great Jove) blamed with her speech severe:
(Silent) they naught would know, and no relief
Could give, but tears (sad Eccho's to her grief)
What should she do? yet to another strain
She (falls) into entreaties mild again.
Pardon (quoth she) ye deities, if love,
If my too strong affection, did move
A wretch to those extremes, that were unfit;
Pardon ye Powr's divine and pity it.
Look, how I kneel; look, how mine age does bow
Low at your feet: (thus prostrate) let me know
(Only) the certainty of my sad state,
The manner of my woes unfortunate:
(What e're) let me but know it; I shall think,
That fate (not mischief) made my fortunes sink:
Let me but see my daughter once: not? no?
Shall I, the search of mine own blood forgo?
But, fear not (whosoever thou art: thy prey
Safely enjoy; I, to thy choice give way.
And if the Rauisher (you goddesses)
Have bribed you, for your silence? yet confess,
At least (Latona) thou, thou that too well,
Lucina's name, and our great pains can tell;
That double birth, the twins (which thou did bear)
Well testify, how much the love and fear
Of children costs us; thou, still happy art
In two, whilst I of one have lost my part:
So may thou ever (to thy wished desire)
Enjoy thy yellow son and daughter dear.
The goddesses (at these fresh plaint's) no power
Had, to refrain; but with a second shower
Of tears, they washed their cheeks: poor remedy
(She says) your weeping silence gives to me:
Ay me! they all are fled; why stand'st thou here?
Why stay'st thou longer, and perceiu'st not clear,
That heaven is armed against thee? rather haste,
Search every nooke of land, the Ocean vaste:
I will, and follow the diurnall Sun
(Vnweari'd) with him in swift course to run,
Through hidden ways; not an hour of rest,
No sleep shall seyze upon his troubled breast,
Till my lost pledge I find: (whether her grave
Be dug by Thetis in Iberian wave;
Or in the Red Sea she entrenched be)
No place, no secret corner shall go free:
Not frosty Rhenus, or Riphaean cold,
Nor heat of Lybian sands, shall me withold
From strictest search; and (till I find her out)
The utmost limits will I prye throughout,
Of Southern wind, and (for a further proof)
Will visit Boreas in his snowie roof:
Then, will I tread on Atlas in the West;
Next, with my flaming torches in the East
Hidaspcs shines; then look upon me, Jove:
Look, how this wandering vagamund shall roue,
Through Towns and Countries: do thou look on me,
Thou Juno; and in my destruction, see
And reap thy full content: then, then, no more
Grieve at this rival (thy base husbands whore.)
Insult ye proud gods at my fortunes mock,
Boast your great triumph on poor Ceres stock.
Thus spoke she, and from off the lofty top
Of her known Aetna downward slid, to lop
The branches from those trees that must give light,
And guide her errant labors in the night:
Near to the River Acis, stood a Grove
(Whose little streams, in memory of love)
Fair Galatea to the Sea prefers,
And often there bathes the beauteous limbs of hers:
The trees grew thick here; their entangled boughs
On every side shadow high Aetna's brows;
Thither brought Jupiter the captived prey
Which, he (long since) had got in Giant frey:
The wood grew proud of that Phlegraean broile,
And victory, clothed every tree with spoil;
Here, the vast jaws, and each prodigious limb
Of Giants hung, their heads, their faces grimme.
(Yet threatening) to those boughlesse trunks are fixed
And fastened: ('among which) the bones are mixed,
Of scattered Serpents, and their rugged skins
(Shrunk up by thunder from their withered finnes:)
No tree, here grew, that not preserved the fame,
And of some conquered Giant bore a name.
This, of Aegeons hundred hands, the steel,
(Whose weight her crooked branches bent:) did feel
That Caeus Arms, this shield of Mimas wore,
A groaning fourth naked Ophton bore.
And last, a Fur tree (taller then the rest,
For broad shade-spreading leaves, amongst all, the best)
The smoakie Trophies of Enceladus
Their king, did load: the weight (so ponderous)
Had broke the body of that goodly tree
(Did not a strong Oak prop with near supply:
So sacred was the fear and piety
To this most memorable grove, that free
From least offense, the heavenly Trophies hung;
Nor durst rude shepherds rustic pipe and song
Draw hither, their faint bleating flocks to shade;
Nor Cyclop's once with cruel axe invade
The lusty Oak: when Poliphemus spies
This place, he from the sacred shadow flies.
But neither deity, nor reverence
Of zeal, religion of the place; from thence
Long kept the incensed Ceres, whose strong arm
With wheeling Sithe (to their lamented harm)
Cuts down the trunklesse bodies: (in this mood)
Even Jove she wounds; the Pine tree falls, nor stood
The smoother Cedar, but does prostrate fall,
Here, she destroies; there, leaves: and (last of all)
She looks upon her handy-worke, and viewes
The mangled bodies (which of them to choose
Fit'st for her purpose:) so, the Merchants care
Prouides (for safety of his life and ware,
Which he transports, to some long voyage bent)
('Against angry storms and tempests provident.)
(First, the tall Cedar and hard Beech applyde
To the maine mast and rudder, the Barks guide)
The softer wood to the light Oar he gives,
And strongest trees for moisture Keele contriues.
Two neighboring Cypresses, there, lift on high
Their towering, untouched heads (that kiss the sky)
Such two on Ida's top, fleet Simois
Did never see; Orontes, such (as these)
Did never sprinkle with swift streams (that flow
Unto Apollo's Grove, where none such grow)
So equal in their height, and boughs esteemed,
So even they grew, that brother-twins they seemed;
(Despising with their fellow-tops, the grove:)
These, Ceres chose for torches; and would prove
Her stubborn strength upon them both; when (first)
Her arms she tuck't, then folded up her skirt:
Next, with sharp axe, she hewes alternately
The two, (that on the ground straight grouelingly
Alike, they suffered in their fall) alike,
Their locks they shed, the Fawns and wet Nymphs shricke
(For grief) to view their ruin (as they lay)
She lifts them up, and bears with her away:
(The loose hair turned over her shoulder) she
Descends from panting Mountains suddenly,
Through flames she goes, through craggy rocks does tear
A passage; the parch't sands (that skorne to bear
Her steps) she kickes.
So, cursed Maegaera hastens the wished light
Of fatal Yew trees, when some horrid slight
She practices against Cadmus, Theban walls;
Or, when her malice and pale vengeance falls
On poor Thyesti'an town; darkness and Fiends
Make her a lane to pass (as she descends
To Phlegeton) in whose hot waves she dipp't
The deadly lights, that with his flames were typ't:
So, when the goddess was arrived at last;
At the Rocks scorching mouth, she from her cast
The Cypresses, into those jaws (her face
Turned from the smoke) now every hollow place
Was filled, and the contracted fire (with-drawne)
Kept in the flames, and stopped their wauing yawne:
The Mountain rumbles, Mulciber 'gan strive
(Half choked) the imprisoned vapors to relieve.
When, lo; the berry-bearing Cypress leaves
Did shine, and sulphur mixed (that to them cleaues)
Made the boughs crackle, and high Aetna raise
His old flames higher by this new-come blaze.
Then took she up the firebrarnds (whose dim light
Lest it should fail her in the tedious flight)
She 'nointed with the juice that Phaeton
His Steeds; and liquor that the Moon, upon
Her Heifers, sprinkles. Now soft rest does creep
On mortal brows, their eyelids folds in sleep:
Whilst she (with griefe-torne heart upon her way
And progress) something thus t'her self would say:
Full little did I think (while thou were mine)
To look thee with these lights (my Proserpine;)
Loved Mothers wishes, fervent strong desire
Of marri'ge bed, and holy Nuptial fire
Were my delights: and oh! how I did long,
In heaven to hear the Saffron Hymen's song.
But Lachesis (that makes no difference
'Twixt men and gods) would not with me dispense:
How honored was I lately, how adored
By Suitors great, that me for thee implored?
What Mother (though she never so fruitful were)
But thought me happier then her self (to bear
Even thee alone) my first, my latestioy:
By thee my barrenness did fruit enjoy:
By thee was I a goddess (deifi'd)
(Whilst thou my glory were, thy Mothers pride:)
I never unto Juno 'inferior was
(Whilst thou had being squallid now and base)
Gramercie, Jove: but why give I a part
To him? (my self the causer of my smart)
'Twas I, 'twas cruel I; now I disclose
My carelessness, that thee, to busy foes
Forsaken, left: whilst I (securely glad)
Frisk't to the noise of Bacchus daunces (mad)
And with the sound of rattling arms (unkind)
(Whilst thou were rapt) the Phrigian Lion ioin'd
To the swift Chariot; but behold (my sweet)
The punishment for these deseruings meet.
Look on the gaping wounds upon my face,
The red-turn'd furrows, that my breast deface;
My womb (unmindful) that it thee had borne,
Look, how by frequent strokes it is rent and torn:
Where shall I seek thee, in which heaven above?
Under what Clymate here, on earth do move?
What guide, what tracke shall lead me? (might I know
But in what kind of Chariotthou did go,
Where the damned thief does live, in earth or seas?)
The print of the swift wheels my sight would please.
I go, I go, where my faint plants shall guide,
Whether blind chance: sorrow, like this betide
Diona (all forsaken) may she look.
For her lost Venus.
Shall it be lawful, will some Destiny
Give way (my child) that once more I may see,
Once more embrace thee? does that beauty reign
Upon thy cheeks, and freshness still remain?
Or shall I hap (unhappy) to behold
Thee such, as night and dreams have often foretold?
Thus said she; and the first step she advanced
From Aetna, on the flowers to light, she chanced:
Those flowr's, that to her grief, her daughters fate
Were conscious: she detests with cursing hate
Those, and the place (made privy to the rape:)
Then (through confused paths) she her course does shape,
Pryes through the fields with blazing light, and low
Sh'inclines the brands (all comfortless) in woe,
With tears she bathes her cheeks: tears, that abound;
(Producing sighs and groans, that with their sound
Ring in the air and woods) the flaming light
Now spreds on far, whose shadow in calm night
Swimmes on the Seas; the blaze of it does fly
To Lybian coast, and banks of Italy;
The Etruscan shore was bright and clearly seen,
And (from the inflamed Seas) the Sirtes shine.
Next unto Scilla's dens she goes, the light
Unusual, those mad dogs did affright:
VVhl'st (some astonished) silent were (the rest
More hardy) bark't at their unwelcome guest.
