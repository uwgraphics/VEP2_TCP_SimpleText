The defense of the Marriage of Preistes: Agenst Steven Eardiner bishop of
Wynchester / Wylliam Repse bishop of Norwiche / and agenst all the bisshops
and preistes of that false popissh sect / with a confutacion of their
unadvised vows unadvisedly diffined: whereby they have so wykedly separated
them whom God cowpled in lawful marriage.

Thou shall be destroyed with the breath of the Lordis mouth / O Anticriste.
Isaie. xi. When God is our refugye and rok unspeakable / fownde and felt in our
tribulacion. Psalm. xlv. WHen the people of God called Israel Exo. i. and iij.
/ had been aftir the death of Joseph. c. xl. years in that yerney furnace and
hard bondage of Egypt / our almighty merciful father / considering their
heuey labors in clay and bryke / and hearing their deep syghes and greuouse
groninges crying daily under their intolerable burdens: and agene remembering
his promise made with their fathers / Abraham Isaac and Jacob: sent them Moses
and Aaron with his word and miracles to deliver them out of that miserable
seruitute from under that heuey yok of hardnecked Pharao figureth the pope as
did Joseph figure Criste.
Pharao / the figure of the pope / which knew not Joseph the figure of Crist.
Many Moses and Aarons / as faithful and fre prechers has our almighty God
daily and often sent with his everlasting word of salvation and delyuerance /
unto the hardnecked popes and to their indurated bisshops through out all
cristendome to deliver his sely careful floke out of the miserable
anticristen bondage of their dampnable doctrines / erroneous and false religion
/ supersticious rytes / deuillisshe tradicions / and sinful ceremonies / even
the intolerable burde^s of men laid upon pore men's ^at. xx^ij.
backs which theirselues they will not once to wche to ease men. And yet then /
as Pharao with his charmers and enchau^ters resisted God / his messagers / his
word and miracles (not with standing himself with his Egypcio^s were so gre
uously plaged) even so this day yet ar Cristes messagers / his gospel and
miracles to / not only spightfully and cruelly resisted / but destroyed /
burnt and banisshed. Wherein yet Pharao / indurated haithen idollater / as he
was / showed himself more ientle and mercisull to Israel / then do the pope and
our bisshops declare themselves to their pore flocks. For Pharao at last seeing
his first begoten son and all the first begoten childern and bestis in Egypt
deed leet Israel depart. But the pope and our bisshops will first see not only
their first begoten sons / daughters / with their mothers and all their
misbegoten childern their bisshoprykes and themselves to clean gone / but also
the first begoten faith that only justifies with all the christian religion
taken from them and given to the Tnrkes and Jews better worthey to have it
then they / ere they will suffer the almighty message of goddis holy word to
take place and to con sent there unto for the delyuera^ce of Cri stes church
out of their da^pnable doctrines popisshe errors and false religion / freely
to follow the trwe prechers of the word of their salvation in Cristes blood.

What an intolerable burden is it to young persons perpetually burning in
concupiscence and desyer of the to there ^en. ^^. Heb. xii^
sex / Whom God created to be through wedlok the lawful remedy and help one
for ye to there by his almighty word naturally joining and enclyning the man to
love the woman and the woman the man / as the grass or tree in her time to
grow and to bringeforth fruit / and yet / for this dampnable prohibicio^ of
the pope / they may not enjoy goddis honorable ordinance and lawful remedy
of wedlok instituted of God? When God Genesis iij.
saw man alone / he said / It is not good for man sole to live. But our
anticriste^ papists / the very sead of ye serpent / wyser then God / for that
yet at the temptacion of ye serpent their father / they daily eat of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil / seeing man alone / affirm and decree
agenst God / That it is better for man to live alone yea to have an C. whores
(as once said bishop Stokesley of London in open judgment to a married preiste)
then to be married to his own wife. yea they had lever (as experience techeth)
keep other mennis wives abuse their daughters / violate their maidens and
haunte every day a new where prodigiously polluted in all manner fylthines not
to be spoken / then to have their own lawful wives in chaste matrimonye
according to Goddis holy institucion and ordinance. Besides all this / yet
miche more intolerable is it for the pore married men with their lawful wives
and natural dear childern / by their ungodly acts / so cru elly and so
violently (as ye se it of late) to be thus drawn in sondre / as it were with
wild horses / one member from a another so paynfully plucked / that the
howsband may not come into / nor look towerde the same town / where he left
his own wife and his childern pain of death / when ye almighty word of God
^en ^^* ^at. x^^
so int^erly cowpleth and joins man and wife together into one flesh
perpetually to live as all one / yt greuouse threats there are threatened to
them / what so ever the^ be / which are so blasphe mous ly bold as to separate
and slaye them whom god joins. Everlasting da^pna ij. these. ij
cion abides them that so arrogantly exalte themselves against the most high
god / that they will perniciously peruerte and dampnab^y destroy that natural
order and inclynacion of generation and love / which God himself by his first
ferme creacio^ with his everlasting almigh ty word has engraven and ingra^^ed
into the nature of man and woman. For when they had thus separated the wife
from her own howsbo^de / then were there no small married men of birthe (whom I
could name) yt fell to woyng of some preistis wives and would have made them
their whores if ye pore women had not resisted their deuellisshe entysements.
Thus ye se under what holy pretense the noble married men separated preistis
from their trwe wives to make them their whores / which is but a lawghig game
and gaudye unpunished unto these great men ye bisshops true captiued gostly
childerne. But under what holy ypocritissh pretense (I pray you) has this
spiritual serpentyne sead / transfiguring themselves into ij. cor. xi.

of wedlok? verily eue^ under the feigned wyuelesse chastity the oc casion of al

If their articles and acts / concern Cristis religion / show us some one
word of Crist to confirm them / or if they be of Cristes religion / so must
they be made in Cristis and his apostels time / which taught and wrote us an
absolute / complete and perfect religion / nothing omitted necessary for the
christian church and for their salvation: but of these their cokatrices eggs
and spyders webbes to pertayne to the christian religion there is not one word
nether in gospel nor pistle nor in no part of the bible / but ye plain
contrary: wherefore they are very venom / and the poisoned doctrine of the devil
concerning anticristis religion. If these their cokatrices eggs so lately
laid and latelyer hatched in their spyders webbes / must pertayne to Cristes
religion / how happens it yt nether Crist nor his apostles in their days /
nor yet the holygost all these. xv. c. years espied not them? but now at last
in this new blak parliament unto Wynchester and to his dronken proud crowns of
Ephraim Isa^. xxviij.
the bisshops they be reveled? It is not fully. CCCCC. years ago sense this re
ligion creptyn. It is all to late now in the later end of the world to
receive any new articles of owr faith. Nether is there any man of ye power as
to make us any one article of owr faith / owr faith and religion is to old /
and to firm by God / to be now new turned changed and altered by man. Crist
at his departing promised his apostles that the Ios^. xvi.
holygost should teache them al trwthe con cerning the christian religion / and yet
he never taught them these abominable blasphemies and lies. Belyk Cristes
church of England has gretely erred un to this last blak parliament. Crist
commanded Mat. xxviij.
his apostles and their successors to teache nothing but yt at he had taught
and commanded them to keep. The ho Deu. iiij 2. xij. Prou. ii^ Eccle. iij i.
pet. iiij
ly ghost straightly commands in many places / that man add not unto his reli
gion and word / his own ded dreams and deuillissh deuyces. In things
concerning our faith and religion / there ought noma^ to presume to decre /
teache or enacte any thing without ye express word of God / except he will be
exalted above God / fownde a liar / a man making gods law inco^plet and
imperfit / and siche a presumptuouse papist that usurps to illustre the
bright son of verite with his own blind balde lying reasone. Repent repent
Wyn. with thy dampna Isa. xvij
ble faccion lest the hastye whirle wynd of goddis present heavy indignation
carye you shortly away.

When I had red in Deutero. xxviij. with what plages and curses / as with
madness / furye / and blyndenes / God smyteth Romans ^.
his reprobated vessels of wrath casten up through their own herts lusts unto
almaner filthenes: I could not so gretely meruell at Wynchesters / and his
faccions indurated blyndenes / where as for the defense of their abominable
whoredom / and destruction of chaste ma trimony ordined of God / he so wykedly
/ so blasphemously / agenst the law of nature / all godly order / all reason /
and wy^chesters vows.
agenst all scripture / diffineth. That vow to be lawful and aduysedly made /
which is made aftir. xxi. yer old. And miche less wonder it is / to se siche
blind bisshops forsaken of God / to separate and slaye the pore innocents whom
God cowpleth. For as it is the doctrine of ye devil which they enacte and
defend / so must the childern accomplesshe their fathers work is which was
both liar and Io. xiij.
ma^sseyer from ye beginning. If Wynch. and his bisshops had not ben thus
stryken with blyndenes of god (I speak not in this book agenst the seculare
sort / in this parle* because that I se in this their spiritual cause / as
the bisshops ar the autours thereof / so seduce they daily the ignorant
simplicite of the layte as they list by their false serpentyne persuasions)
they might have se^e their own diffinicion of vows to co^dempne them selves.
For Wyn. himself / aftir. xxi. years old created ye popes creature / doctor
of the popis law / aftir ward popisshly preisted / and at last Romisshly
bisshopped made at every his creacio^ a solemn vow to be obedient to the
pope now dedicated to his church and holiness / which vows either he has
broken and so is worthey hanging (as it was first enacted) orels he keeps still
his vows / which is most to be believed. He and his / made vows to live
without their own wives / but whether they keep other mennis and whores / let
the common voice and their open acts be iuges.

But let us expende and way this Unad^y sed^y per tayneth to dis^r^ cion and
no^ to ve res of xx.
word unadvisedly / and see whether it pertains to the age and years of.
xxi. or to discrecion / judgment and knowledge: He is said to do a thing
advisedly that does it with good consyderacion / judge meant / discrecion and
knowledge of all the circumstances that may pertayne to the fact / of what age
so ever he be. For as it is not the. xxi. years of age that mesu reth wysedom
discrecion and knowledge / so is not judgment discrecio^ and knowledge nor
wisdom tied to any age prescript of Wynchester. Many men be more blind and
folisshe aftir they are promoued to be bisshops and have once dronken of apo.
xvij
ye gloriouse whores golden cup of Ba bylon / then when they were but pore cy
sars and scolers in Oxforth and cambringe. And some / the elder they wexe / ye
more foles they ar. I knew myself / young men of. xviij. and. xx. years /
better learned / of better judgment knowledge / wisdom and discretion then the
old hoar headed doctor / and many ar called of God un to ye knowledge of his
trwthe not before xxx. or. xl. etc. Crist calls not every idle man into his
vyneyarde / all at one hour / as ye may see Mat. xx. nor gives men his giftis
of the spirit at Wyn thesters appointed year / nor is not restrained by
Wynchesters diffynicion / from the increase of his giftis. He could sanctify
Ion. bapt. and Iere. in their mothers wo^bes and call his disciples to him
aftir or before. xxi. year / and convert Paul when he lysted / but passhur
Wyn. will apoynt the holygost to age and hour / and therefore has he
unadvisedly diffyned his unadvised vows. Tell me Win. by thy faith / wast you
not once advisedly married to ye hoar of Babylon aftir. xxi. as you say in thy
book of thy trwe disobedience and false faith? and made not thou then thy
vow? If you beist now divorced why kepest thou still thy whores laws? why
defendest you so stefly her wyked tradicions? why so cruelly fightest you for her
ceremonies / rytes / and this her deuillissh doctrine of forbidding preistes to
marye? If althi^gis yt men do aftir. xxi. year of age be advisedly done / why
do ye undo in the later counsel ye same which was decreed in the former / and
vnacte this year that at ye enacted the formere year? ye were no babes when ye
made your first decrees / cownsels / acts and laws. Aduysedly and unadvisedly
therefore must be referred to wit wisdom / knowledge / experience / discrecion
and judgment (oh passhur Win) and not tied to your age of. xxi. Wherefore ye
played but a folissh part / so unadvisedly to diffyne your unadvised vows /
And more unadvisedly enacted you siche unadvised vowers to be separated and
hanged. And if ye repent ye not of your unadvised acts / seperat^g them who^
god cowpled / you and your fellows must aduysedly by goddis decreed word Iere.
xx. be shortly turned into pauor: yt is / your soden vpclyming shall have a
sode^ fereful fall. An vnad uy^ed vo we.


That vow therefore is made vnad uysedly (of what age so ever the person be)
which is made without good aduysement knowledge or consyderacion of his own
power and stre^gthe to perform it: and so for his own weakness is compelled to
break it / of which kind of vows ar all the wyuelesse and howsbondlesse vows
of al preistes and nonnes / and of all siche as have not the gift to live sole.
Item all those vows ar unadvisedly made / when ye person considers not
before whether they be lawful and consonant with Godis word or no. And if they
be against Gods word (as ar all the vows of them which to ^. ^or. vi^
avoid fornicacio^ ar commanded to marye) so ar they not only unadvisedly made
/ but also ungodly. Also what vow so ever is by co^pulsion extorted / not fre
/ please not God / has nether Goddis word for it / nor no example in holy
scripture / that same is both unadvised and ungodly / as ar the vows of
preistes and nonnes / as ye shall see here aftir: wherefore they ought aduysedly
to be broken.

Answer me / passhur Wynch. Whether ^erodis vo^^. (...). xiiij
was Herodis vow made to his daughter for her dawnsinge before him and his
gestis to give her what so ever she should ask / lawful and aduysed? It was
made aftir. xx. year of his age: ergo it was lawful. And so by Wynch. it was
lawful for him to smite of John bapt. his head. Also the. xl. men in ye Acts
act. xxiij
of thapostles: which vowed never to eat bread till they had slain Paul /
aftir Wyn. ar lawful. And all ye vows of our old bissh. and abbotes made to
be obedient to the pope and his laws must nedis be lawful aftir Wyn. and there
fore he and they keep them still / as every man may se it. I^ a vow of
wyuelesse or howsbondlesse chastity made immedi ately aftir. xxi. or. xxiii^.
years of age be lawful and aduysed: why then did Pau le so diligently co^mande
the bishop Timothe to reiecte all young vowesses / and non to be admitted
before. lx. years of age / but siche young persons to be mary ed / govern
their howses and to begette i. Tim. v.
childerne? adding the consyderacion / yt sich young persons whether they be
me^ or weme^ / when they shall begin to wexe wanton agenst Crist / they will
marye / having a sclawnderouse infamy (for somich signifies the Grek word
translated / in condempnationem) because they have casted away their first
vow or promise. I will therefore (says Paul.) young persons to marye / to
beget childern / giving non occasion to our aduer saryes to speak evil of
them. And because many me^ diuersely take this word prima fides / Thou shall
know (good first faith or chief pro myse what it is.
reder) that siche vowers made two vows one subordined to the the other / The
first and principal vow was / no more to marye / the second was to persevere
in obsecrationibus et prec^bus noctu dieque as it stands in the text / that
is to con tine we in fervent prayers / and not in wanton nyse lyuig / as ye
read of Anna Pha Luke ij.
nuels daughter / which departed not out of the temple seruinge God with wache
/ sorrowful mind or heuey expectacion / abydinge for the redemption of Israel
etc. this is the plain simple sense as to wching their first faith no more to
marye as the circumstance of the text and conference of the places declare.
But here ye se plainly that Paul forbids young persons to vow before lx.
years: and yet Wyn. will have their vows lawful at. xxi. and. xx^iij.

Gregory the. vij. pope / otherwise call Gregory the vij.
led hiltebrande / or rather the hell fyerbrande ye most vngodlyest wretch
that ever was / fylling al Germanye and France and Rome to / yea all
cristendome full of batail and strife stering up siche tragedyes and tumulte
betwixt the Emprowr and his dukes as had not ben seen before / himself at last
deposed and another pope setvp / one of them bitterly cursing and poisoning
another / decreed at last and compelled preistis to forsake their lawful wives
/ which lived. cccc. xx. years agoo. Sense this wyked anticristes days / ye se
all the vows of preistes to be violently extorted / and open whoredom
lice^cio^sly used and laughed at. And now at last when God of his graciouse
mercy had sent his prechers with his word to delyuere his chosen out of this
damp nable and fylthy living / yet like an hardnecked pharao / does this
Greasy gar. of win. Gregory ye. vij. his own sone (save yt Gregory was never
so proud a lucifere) resist God and his word and wilnot suffer cristes people
to be delivered out of the popis dampnable decrees and miserable bondage. Were
not the holy married preistes and bisshops of the old testa meant as Melchizedek
/ Ietro / Moses / Aaron / Samuel / Helye / zacharye / and the prophets / and
the married preistes of the new testament as the Apostles and so forth the
bisshops a thousand years aftir / till Gregoryes days as good me^ as these
wyuelesse aduouterers these last. cccc. xx. years? Preisthod was never clogged
nor restrained unto siche wyked vows until this Gregoryes days / wherefore
Gregoryes preisthod cannot be ye just preisthod which Crist instituted to
preche his gospel but a pro digiouse Sodomitical sect of unshame faced
shauelingis.

Even the very author of this prohibicion / preistes ^. ^im. iiij
to not marye / declares ye preisthod and the doctrine of their vows: Paul
affirming it to be the doctrine of the deuyle / the author of the mordinate
orders. Whosoever list to read the histories and holy scriptures shall se that
certain of the apostles as Peter / Paul and Philip theuangelist or precher had
wives and the holy bisshops. M. years following For this writes the holy martyr
Ignatuis Ignatius
that lived in saint Paulus time in a pistle unto Philadelph / with thought that
wedloke should minissh the holiness of the married persons / saying / Iethro and
Moses were the preistes of God / and also there were of the chief of ye
preistis of Criste / and yet had they wives and childern. Was not Aaron and his
sons the ministers of holy thingis? did they not offerevp and pray for the
people? and yet were they married. And had not also thapostles of our Lord Jesus
Criste wives? I esteem them not / nor yet the other blessed men never the worse
because they were cowpled in wedloke: but I pray god (says he) I may be worcester
they to sit at their feet in the kingdom of God / with these other married
persons as Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Isaye and as ar these holy married men
Peter and Paul and other of thapostles which were married not for no lust but
to increase their posterite. yea it is written Mat. viij. That Jesus entering ye
house of Peter / saw his wives mother syk and healed her. And Luke in the
Acts says. And we went into ye house of Philip which was one of the. vij.
that preched ye gospel: he had. iiij. daughters which did hear the scriptures
taught them. But and if our synful sodomyts say that aftir Criste had called
them to preche / to baptyze and to break ye bread to admit prechers / for this
was all their administracio^ commanded of Criste / they forsook their wives /
My short solucio^ i. cor. vij.
is: That they lie. prove it by scriptures if they can / for Paul thus writes
/ Them that are once married / not I / but the Lord commands them yt the wife
be not separated from her howsbo^de / which if she be separated / she must
abide unmarried orels be reconcyled to him / nor the man may not forsake his wy
fe. And therefore Paul answering siche i. cor. ix.
false prophetis yt rekened him and other ye less holy for carrying about
their wives said: have we not power and liberty to eat and drink and to carye
with us our wives as do the other apostles Peter and the brethern of the lord?
Also who god has joined / se yt noman separate them says Crist Mat. xix.
Saint Clemens li. iij. ca. xxx. of the story Ecclesiastic.
as ye read of Eusebye / writing agenst the^ yt despised wedlok / says these
wordis. will ye reprove the apostles? For both Peter and Philip had wives and
mary ed their daughters to their howsbondes / yea and eue^ Paul himself
steketh Phi. iiij
not in his pistle to make me^cio^ of his wife greting her calling her his very
trwe faithful yokefelowe / whom he left at Philippia for a ceason that he
might the spedelier pass through the countries preching the gospel. In the
east chirches many holy bisshops had their lawful sons by their wives in
time of their office / as ye may read of Socrate li. ix. ca. xxxviij. Tripart
hysto.
Constantinopolytano in Epiphanio. Also Iustinianus Themprowr wri tinge
Epiphanius bis. married. Gregory Nazianzene bis. mar.
unto Epiphanian the bishop of Constantinople / commends him the more that
he was a preistis son. Also Gregory Nazianzene was a bishop and a preistis
son: For in the primatyue church all the time before Gregorye the wyked /
preistis had wives / and in reding holy scriptures they succeeded their fathers
in the same office / as ye Policar pus bi^ married.
may read of Policarpe pastore of Ephe sine which writing in a pistle to
saint Uictore confesses himself to be ye aight bissh. lynially desce^ding from
his great grandfathers into the same office. And read Euseby cesariense in his
v. book. ca. xxii.
what is more manifest then yt at Paul writes. 1. Timo. iii. and Tit. i. That
siche flokfeders must be chaste married men content with one wife / men that can
well govern their own howses in bringig up their childern / supposing that
siche men having these / with other there pre scribed qualites should be apt
and able to teache well an hole parisshe. Who sees not now therefore Wynchester
for his own proud arrogante mind and wykednes worthily smyten with blyndenes
and obstinate induracio^ / with Pha rao to persecute / to divorce and slaye the
pore married preistes? whom the spirit of God commands for the avoiding of
fornicacio^ every one of them non except to have his own wife: and every woman
/ non except / for the same cause i. cor. v^^.
to have her own howsbonde. And if thou can not live chaste / Paul co^man
death the to marye. For beter it is (says he) to marye then to suffer burniges
in they flesh. But unto wyked Wynchester which once seemed to favor Gods
word before he was promoted to the cardinal Thomas Wolsayes service / there
is no place of repentance nor no wynchester synneth agenst the holygost
grace left to believe Gods word / becau se / not of ignorance / but wetingly
and will lingly of a set maliciouse purpose herdneckedly he synneth agenste the
trwthe which is the syn agenst the holyghost / which Wyn. when he saw so
manifest scriptures agenst him / then he turned his ordinance agenst preistes
vows making them lawful and aduysed because they be made at. xxi. years old
/ when their own master of the sentences call the vows of the seclare
preistes vota tacita / dome or not expressed vows. There is noman that ever
gave preiste orders yt can come forth / either to testifye that ever he herd
the priest whom he made by express words to vow in clear words simply
virginal chastity / or to bringforth writing of ye preiste his own hand that
ever he vowed simpli citer siche chastity as Wynche. byndeth them to. But upon
this condicto^ / quantum permiserit humana fragilitas / yt is to say / I vow
chastity as far as man's fraylte will suffer me / and no farther do I vow. If
Steven gardener esteem the still domme vows / and the con dicionall promyses of
preistes somiche / yt they must dye for breking them / why looks he and his
bisshops no beter to the solem^ne open vows of every lay man married vowing
solem^ly to keep himself to his own wife? why suffers he and his faccion
somiche open and abominable aduoutry in their diocesses? both great men /
mean and low of every sort many keep whores besides there own wives
contrary to their own open vows and promyses / and yet for good di ners /
festes / gifts and favor / and for fere / they are suffered unpunished / Is it
syn for a pore preiste to keep him only to his own lawful wife / and no syn
at all to the lay married man besides his wife to keep whores O Wynchester with
your fellows? but woe / woe / be unto you that lay these heavy burdens upon pore
men's bakks which ye wilnot to wche to ease them with your leest fin gere / woe
be to you that say good to be Isa. v.
evil / bitter to be sweet / derkenes to be the light and eco^tra. Woe be to
you that kill the pure innocents / and maintain the abominable aduouterers.

But Wynchesters unadvised vows wherefore the po pissh preistes will not marye.
are not the matter why he so fyer^ely fyghteth and incenseth the king and his
nobles agenst married preistis / but he and his pharisaicall faccion knows
well. What a pleasure it is to keep other men's wives / their childern to sitteby
other men's fyers / and as themselves live by other men's labors so make they
other men to kouer their whores and whelps under the only names of howsbonde
and father. Wyn. and his shaven feel what ple sure it is to have so miche
change of whores / that when they be weary of one / they may turn her up and
take another. They have othermens wives better thepe / then their own / It is
an heuye yoke to be cowpled with one (parchaun ce a shrewe) as long as they
live / be she syke or hole pore or rich etc. and then to sorrow for their
children to be brought up / and for their howsholde. For well knew these idle
soft shaven sects / what kares / burdens charges and incom modites there
follow and chaunse to true chaste and honorable wedloke. But and if they were
once iustlely yoked unto one wife to sustain ye moleste kares of matrimonye /
full sone should their prwde combs and crowns be cut and their ioylye p^kocks
tails be plukt / their riches minisshe / and their vain glyterig glory glyde
away into dust. And yet is there another cause why the se proud prelates will
not have theirowne wives. For as they wylbe diuyded in habit / aparell /
shauing / buzzing and singing / eating and drinking / and in their strange holy
profane iestures / pope ho ly sole state from the common christian religion / so
would they by siche ipocryse seem to the simple people / yea and look for it to
/ the hyghlyer to be exalted / more reuere^ced / esteemed and endewed with the
rycher and pleasaunter possessions. For at siche strange toys and diversity of
disgoysinges in long gowns sirplices crowns copes hodes etc. the fond people
stand and wounder at them / as at an owyl out of Athens or at an ape full of
pratye pastymes out of Portingale. And to be short / therefore have these long
typeted and longer tayled trey tours chosen them this strange singler separated
sect that they might show themselfes the playner pharisays both in name and
very deed. For a pharisay Pharisaye.
in english is one separated and diuyded from the common sort / both in habit
/ diet / going / words / dedis / rytes / iestures / ceremonies / but yet I
think the pharisayes in Cristis time were never so shoorne nor smered / nor so
rich and proud / nor so ignorant beastis / nor siche abominable whoremo^gers
as ar owers for they had their own lawful wives. But in long prayinge in
sight mat. xxiij
of alme^ / in deuoweringe the pore / in teching and not doing / in dilating
their wide and side gowns / loking for cappe / kne / mastership / lordeship /
grace fatherhod / lokinge for the ouermost place in feasts / to be saluted in
ye market place and to be called rabi / my lord bishop M. doctor / M. person
etc. our later present phariseis agree well with the first pharisais and former
ipocrytes. Also they agree in the shuttingvp of the king dome of heaven from
them that would enteryn / theirselues standing without never into enter. They
agree also in importune labors to procure mo ypocrytes daily to be shaue^ into
their sinful sect / mo pharisayes / like preistes / prechers / and like
bisshops / stronger to make their anticristen kingdom agenst the lord and his
anointed / They agree in ^sal. ij. ^at. xv.
like blyndenes / themselves blind leders of their blind captives / they agree
ye they excede in couetuousnes ambicion and pride / and to be short / they
excede the old pharisayes in ipocrysye and in the bloudshedinge of the
innocents / which old pha. persecuted Criste and his apostles unto death.

The dukes grace of Northfolke made the duke of north. reason.
this pollitike reason in the parliament house before the king and his nobles
(for scripture knows he non) That preistis should not marye. For then / said
he / they will perchance mary with our and other ientleme^s daughters and so
have their dowryes ioynters and lands with them / and at last ye shall se the
bishops have all our lo^dis to: which rea son / lo / it was well allowed. Bu^ I
answer ye dukes grace / No / not so / There is remedy enough for this sore.
your grace shall make a prouiso that no priest nor bishop shall marye with
yours nor with no ientlemans daughter without her parents consent according to
Goddis laws. Orels if this prouiso wilnot serve / Then restore the bisshops
and preistes to their first orders received of Criste to be content with only
meat and i. tim. vi.
drink and clothinge necessary and suf ficient for them. And I dare wara^t
you for your daughters. Orels if this proui se will not hold / let no bishop
nor priest be admitted to cures and flokfedinge but siche as have all the
conditions and qua lites that Paul prescrybeth unto Timothe i. tim. iij. ^^^.
i.
and Tito / and I dare be bownde that non of siche preistes will marye with your
daughters so long as your daugh ters be so vnlernedly prowdly so nycely and
lascyuiously broughtvp. For s^che preistes either be they married all redye orels
seek they siche wives as Paul there decketh and tyerethe. i. Timo. iij. and
apoynteth to them / that is to went / L^^i. xxi
sober / learned / modest / shamefaced / simple / sad / chaast / godly maidens
virtuously broughtvp in reding and under sto^ding trwly ye holy scriptures /
which wilnot disdain to lay to their hands to wasshe / wrynge / spyne /
card / brewe baake / to swepe the house / make read her howsbondis dinner /
wasshe the dysshes and to turn the speete / nourse hirowne childerne with
hirowne breasts / vyset the syke sore and pore be they never so lothely.
Wherefore except your daughters will gladly do all these thin gis / be ye
sewer there will no siche preistes and bisshops as Paul paynteth marye with
your daughters / and if your daughters be siche they will set little by your
goodis and possessions.

Then belyke but for fere of marying with your daughters / It had been lawful
preistis to have had wives. They Job. vi.
that fear the hoar froste (says Job) the deep snow shall fall upon them.
They that fear honest and lawful marriage to chaunse to their daughters /
nothing lykely to be cowpled with these said preistes ordered of Paul / let them
beware lest the proud papistik bisshops and preistes consecrated by the pope
comitte aduoutrye with their daughters and wy ues to: for siche ^hau^ses have
happened. But yet not withstondinge the dukes pollityk high reason / his grace
might have been contented at the leestwyse to have suffered the pore married
preistes to have kept still their own lawful pore wives which were nether
dukes / lordis / nor no ientlemens daughters / and not so cruelly to have rent
them in sondre pain of hanginge / whom God cowpled together.

At last / forbecause / Wynchester and his bisshops had nothing else to color
their acts of the diuorsement / and wyuelesse chastity of preistes / but vows
/ so unadvisedly / so folisshly / and wikedly diffy ned. I shall diffyne and
declare more aduy sedly and trwlier tell you what a lawful vow is. A vow is a
free promise / of that what is a vow.
thing which is in our power to perform it / and which thing / we are sewer
also that God accepts it. In this diffinicion / three thingis in a lawful vow.
there be. iij. thingis to be observed / first that it be a fre promise / as it
is written The first that it be a fre pro myse.
Deutero. xxiij. not compelled / nor extorted for fere / nor for that it be so
intricately and ungodly wrapped in another thing and there to so wykedly
annexed that whosoever will receive the one / he shall be stinged with the the other
agenst his will / as if a waspe be put in to the cup and given a blyndeman to
drink that thirsts. For nonotherwyse have they wrapped in the doctrine of
the devil and cowpled it with their profane orders / so that if you wylt be
admitted to be preiste to preche the gospel (for Criste knew nonother chief
office of preisthod) which thou art bownde in conscience to do if thou beist
called thereto of God / yet will they bind the to live sole against thy will /
and bear y^ in hand that you vowest their chastity when you nether sayist it nor
think it / and so clogge the with that the other thing so covertly inwrapped
that it is not in thy lyberte to perform it. And thus ye see all their
unlawful vows of their sacrificers and religiouse persons to be not fre / but
extorted by compulsion / For when many desyer and vow to live their easy life
in all welthey idleness / they vow (says Wyn.) wyuelesse chastity with they
have so ungodly annexed unto their popissh preisthod / that their may noman be
siche a preiste but he be compelled also / and be yoked with their unlawful
vow for that it is not in man's lyberte to perform it. Now as is their
preisthod unlawful / so is their vow^ joined thereto ungodly / for Criste never
instituted sich anodi ouse ordir of shorelingis and smered sodomy^es but only
faithful prechers / flokfeders / and ministers of his sacraments which should
also provide for the pore: for as for their miss preistes matyns mo^gers idle
euensong vpheapers and salve singers ye scripture knows non siche. Now ye se
that as this popissh shaue^ preisthod with their ungodly wyuelesse vows
thereunto deuillisshly joined / ar but newly invented of the anticristen
bisshops of Rome / contrary to Cristis religion / even so they that receive
siche a preisthod / they receive they watner what poison / and vow that thing
(if they vow any thing at all) which they be not able to perform / snarling
themselves and combring their consciences led captyued unto per petual
dampnacio^ / if they persist in siche a pestelent preisthod. The soul therefore
Le^^t. v.
(says god) that has by oath and vow pronownced with his lyppes to do that
thing / which is either good or evil (what so ever it be that the person
unadvisedly swereth) and so aftirwarde under stand and perceive his own
vnaduysement / he shall be gyltye in one of these thingis. And if any vnlawful^
unclean le^. xxvii
beast had been vowed promys^d or dedicated to God / it must(...)en redeemed /
and not offered. Wh(...)re miche more ought ungodly and unlawful vows to be
corrected and broken. For errors must be mended and hurtes restored. If a man
make a folissh oath / as did Herod / he ought the wyselyer to change it. A
folisshe and an unadvised Eccle. v.
vow / says Solo. displeases God. Now what is more ungodly then a man to
snarle and tangle himself with their popissh preisthod haltred with siche an
ungodly vow which nether scripture knows / nor godly ensample therein
techeth. In. S. Cyprians days: There in his. xi pistle.
were diverse young weme^ that had vowed howsbondlesse chastity / and
aftirwarde could not keep it / whom he with diverse other bisshops consydering
/ cau sed them to marye / saying that it were beter for them to marye then here
to burn in concupiscence and aftir to burn in hell to for their syn / since.
God had provided a necessary remedy therefore. God is not honored with men's
vows and promises yt proceed not of faith / but with dedis of his own
co^mandeme^ts.

Secondarily / a vow must be made ^he second ^ in our power.
of that thing which is in our power to perform it / now is it not in every
ma^s power to have ye gift to live chaste with out a wife when he wills.
There is S^p. viij
no man chaste but it be given him of god: Crist confirming it / answering his
disci Mat. xix
ples / thinkinge the bond of wedlok to be to hard and therefore not to be
expedient to have wives but to live sole / Crist saying alme^ may not receive
this thing / that is to live sole / but siche as to whom it is given. Now are not goddis giftis in our power to have and to keep them / when / and as long as
we list. The expowning of scriptures is the gift of God / which is not given
to every man that would have it / wherefore he were but a fool yt would make a
vow to expowne scriptures ere God had given him the gift and so sent him to
preche. Nether ar ye giftis of God as faith / hope / love / to heal the syke
or to do miracles come^ for every man no more then is wyuelesse chastity common
for every priest / as experience techeth us. yisse (say they) The obieccio^ of
the papistis is soluted.
if ye would ask it of God as we do / ye should have it as we it have / for do
not Criste promise (say they) yt whatsoever ye ask the father in his name / he
will ge ue it you? I answer this aduouterouse generation / yt themselves / as
they never believed this saying of Criste / so did they never ask it in his
name / For well I wot / and so do their own consciences and deades tell the^ /
yt skant one emo^ge an. c. has his gift of chastity for all their pray ing / I
would they which yet keep whores themselves / and bid us pray yt would or have
wives / would once singe this karoll to themselves / Ask and ye shall have it
/ and so put away their whores. But how can they ask any thing in Cri stis
name / when they blaspheme his holy name and despise his holy ordinances and
wholesome remedies tempting God so wikedly as they do? The peticion to live sole
/ as it may not be asked of every man and woman / so is it not for the glory
of his name every shaue^ that bur neth in lust to ask it / when god for his
glory created the remedy and help saying upon siche that it is not good for
man alone to live / let us therefore make him a fellow helper. He therefore
tempts God / which (y^ remedy created of god despised) will pray to live
alone / so farof is this man to glorifye him. Also if every man and woman that
asks it should have it / so were it no special gift but as common as the
prayer. But be it in case that every priest asks it / yet shall not every
priest have it / for Crist himself says / Every of them is not apt nor able
Mat. xix
to receive it / but they unto whom it is given. If their chastity might be
obtained That at is asked ^ obtained by peticion is no vow / but a gift.
by prayer / so were it no vow no more then faith or the gift to under stand
scriptures. For we pray for that thing which is not in our liberty and power
to have or to do it. And here is it plain / by ye papistis own reasening that
they destroy their own vow of chastity / making it no vow at all but a gift
of God / and not in our lybertye nether to vow it nor to have it as we would.
Wherefore as Wynch. has unadvisedly made vows to let preistis marriage / so
has he unadvisedly diffyned them. Those thingis which we are commanded of God
to ask of him / ar plainly prescribed unto us in his scri ptures / which are
the declaracion of his will and of what thing so ever makes for his glory /
but it is nowhere read of any precept or ensample for us to live sole / but
that every man that cannot so live is commanded to marye to avoid fornicacion
and not to pray so to live alone / wherefore the remedy so graciously provided
of God / and set before our eyes / it is not else but a tempting of God and not
a praying to him for the gift. Nonotherwyse then when God creates meat set
before the to eat it and thou forsakest it being hungrye / and prayest God to
live without meat. Wherefore when our shameless chamosts allege us these
scriptures to pray for their chastity / they allege them nonotherwyse to us
then did the devil unto Criste brought upon the pynnacle of the temple /
saying / If thou be^st the son of God fall down headling / and bid thy fa
there send the his angels to save the harmless for they are so commanded to
do: wherefore even as Criste answerde his adversary and temptour the devil with
scriptures putting him to flight / so answer we his ympes with ye same saying
/ avoid ye devils. It is wryte^ / Deu. vi.
thou shall not tempte thy lord God.

Thirdly / a vow must be of yt thing / 3. ^ vow must please God.
which to vow / it pleases God. Now how shall we know / thus to vow at
Winchesters fool age of. xxi. that it plea seth god? It is written that siche
young vowers i. tim. v.
at yt age should be rejected / And in no place of scripture is there precept or
ensample yt god accepted sich supersticiouse and folissh coarcted impossible
vows: wherefore it follows yt Wyn. his unadvised vows please not God / and
To. xiiij
that it is syn so to vow / for whatsoever is not of faith / that same is sin:
to vow Wynchesters wyuelesse chastity has no word of faith for it / ergo it
must ne dis be sin. Paul himself constantly affirms that he has no
commandment of God that any person should live sole / Albeit (says he) my
sentence and i. cor. vi^
mind is this / that sith there is now somiche persecucio^ of the cristens /
to be sole without wives and children / is most ease / and less care and
trowble / ye lighter is their cross in their flight when persecu cion comes
upon. Wherefore my mind is / says he / that sole to live is most quy et and
co^modiouse / but and if a sengle or any sole person maryeth he synneth not /
al beit / says he / I would ye were without care and sorrow and at most ease
and quietenes / this I tell you for your most ease but not to tangle nor to
snarle you with any sole lyuinge: this is Paulis mind.

Also / it cannot be syn that God forby death not / but God never forbode his mi
nisters as his prechers and preistes in general to have their own wives /
ergo / if they marye they sin not / Belyk Wynch. would now make better
preistis and more chaste shauelingis in this parliament then Criste ever made by
his gospel / but as ye see / whylis they go about to mende their popissh
preisthod and to make it more pure / they mar al and make it a very
sodomiticall sentyne. Repent repent Wynch. in time / for the ^at. iij.
are is bent at thy tresodenly to be cutdowne and cast into the fire.

Paul unto the bissho. Timothe and Titus / prescribed to them in his pistles
all thingis necessary to be taught unto the church / eue^ the full form of
ye Christian religion as he did unto other chirches writing / and yet he never
mentioned Winchesters unadvised vows / but abhorred them. Paul sorowed
somiche ^. tim. iii^
for the congregacions lest they should be seduced by the false doctrine of
siche that were gone from the faith attending to sprytes of error / doctrines
wyn. and his facci on ar bear painted of Paul.
of the devil / speking lies through ipocrysye / having their consciences
marked with an hotyerne / forbidding to marye and commanding to abstain fro
meatis created of God to be eaten with thankis of them that know the trwth etc.
that he gave Timothe plainly watnig of siche vnchaast ipocrytes as ar here
painted / and of their pestele^t doctrine forbidding to marye commanding him to
warn men of them and of their doctrine if he would be seen a good minister and
trwe bishop / But when herd ye any of our bytshepes warning men of these
thingis / or any papiste that ever would open this peese of that pistle i. Tim.
iii^. to the people? belyke this peese pertayneth not to the bishops purpo ses /
it served but only for Timothe and his time* yiss says the holygost / These
false techers shall come in posterioribus temporibus / in the later times. The
world was. M. M. yeris under the law of nature not yet wryte^ unto Moses. It
was M. M. yeris under ye law written till Criste came: and sense Criste / it
has been almost. M. M. years under the law of the gospel / wherefore ye se
that this deuillisshe doctrine of forby dinge marriage and meatis / as it
agrees with the persons and autours thereof / so correspondeth it justly to
the time: for it is not fully. ccccc. years agoo sense these errors and false
doctrynes begane to take place. And yet all this while have not our prelates
warned men of them / but they have given great diligence to se this their damp
nable doctrine taught decreed / enacted and kept / pain of death. But oh men
mortal and vayn shadewes / quousque spreta magnitudine dei diligetis vanitate^
et queretis mendacium? how long will Psalm. iii^
ye despise the almighty God / love vanite / and go seek lies? Et nunc ergo
reges Psalm. ij.
intelligite et erudimini / And now now ye kings be wise and beware of your
false and sediciouse trayterouse bis shops / for sewerly if ye follow their wy
ked cownsell and false doctrine / ye heap the heuye wrath and indignacion of
god upon you / with plages present both to you and your realms to be utterly
destroyed. It is but a violent and false religion shortly to fall yt must be
thrustin with violence of acts armed with fire and sword / no scripture
stablisshing them / It cannot stand long / yt at man by tyranny co^pelleth
men to keep / nether is that kingdom long durable yt is holden by fear /
tyranny / and violence / and not by love and laws grownden of Goddis word.
Crist thrusted not in / his gospel by violence (and yet was it the trwth) and
yet it spread. His apostles compelled no man pain of death or fire to receive
the cri sten religion / although they were sewer it was the very faith and
word of salvation and yet it roted fast. And shall christian kyngis at the false
perswasio^s of a few pharisays and popis porklingis which ever have been
traitors to their princes stay men or punisshe their trwe obe dient loving
subtectes / for not receyuig the bishop of Romes deuillisshe tradici ons /
supersticious rytes / false doctrine / and sinful ceremonies / and for
cleauinge to Cristes everlasting word of their salua cion? Oh ye princes of
the world / cleave to goddis word of peace and power / and fere ye no
insurreccio^ of your subjects / preche them ye word of peace / and in peace
shall ye reign over them / but press the word of peace / persecute and slaye
ye prechers thereof / and what ye fered the same shall comvpon you / make ye
never so strong castles and brason walls to defend you. Despise not goddis
monic^on in time / thruste not from you his graciouse word graciously offered.
nequando irascatur dominus et pereatis propter studia vestra. Nam breui

To the Reader.
BE not oftended (godly Reader) that water be called water / and fire be called
fire / let pride be called pride / a dronker be called a dronker / I meruell
that men be a shamed to be called ye same thing that they are / I meruell they
be asshamed to do the thing which they are asshamed to hear: do it not / and
thou shall not be so called. Be thou no aduouterer / nor pharisaye / and thou
shall not of the so hear it. But be thou an ipocryte / a bloudsouper / a
tyra^te / a pharisaie / a persewer of Criste / and the stones in the streate
will so call the. Nether be thou no more offended with him that calls an
indurated obstinate pharisaye / a whelpe of ye edder / an encrusted wall /
painted sepulcres / foxes / venomouse tongues / poisoned sp^res and dedly
darts then thou ought to be angry with John baptiste / with Criste / with his
prophets and apostles / which all ceased not so to call the wyked vepers and
venomouse serpents in their time / whose wykednes and venom was not yet then
so rank / so ripe / and so high grown / as our edders whelps ar now / over
whose heads the immine^t heuye wrath and vengeance of God hangs / ready to
fall down from heaven upon them. Repent ye therefore in time / if ye will no more
be so called. It is nether ignorance nor weakness that may excuse you: the
trwth of goddis word which ye wetingly and wyllingly resist / is to manifest
and to wide spread for to be yet unknown or dissembled / namely of our high
Rabbyns and Masters of Isra el / our bisshops and doctors I mean / which so
far as they will be counted in nothing ignorant so far ar they blind in all
trwth very blind leders of their blind captyued papists all ready together to
fall remediless into the perpetual pit of hell. And even thou Boner bishop
of Londen awake / For the innocent blood of Richard Mekens / whom of late
thou cruelly didist brene in smythfelde cries vengeance upon the / upon
Chameley ye recorder of Londen / and upon those false suborned betrayers /
witnesses and falser questmo^gers / whom all through thine importune labor /
satan excyted unto this shameless slaughter. The lord se to it / and be
shortly your judge.
