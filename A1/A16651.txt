Barnabae Itinerarium, OR Barnabees Iournall.


Barnabae ITINERARIUM, MIRTILI and FAUSTULI nominibus insignitum: Viatoris
Solatio nuperrime editum, aptissimis numeris redactum, veterique Tono BARNABAE
public decantatum.

Authore Corymboeo.

Efficit egregios nobilis alla viros.
Barnabees ^OURNALL, Under the Names of MIRTILUS and FAUSTULUS shadowed: for
the Travelers Solace lately published, to most apt numbers reduced, and to the
old Tune of BARNABE commonly chanted.

By Corymboeus.

The oil of malt and juice of spritely nectar
Have made my Muse more valiant than Hector.
^OYALL PHEANDER to his ROYAL ALEXANDER.
THe title, Noble friend, of ALEXANDER.
Were it naught else, implies a great Commander.
And so you shall be still of me and mine,
With Barnabe couched in a reeling ryme:
Nor wonder, friend, if his dimensions reele,
Whose head makes such Jambicks with his heel.
Upon this Work.
THis three days task was once imposed me,
In the first Spring of my minority;
No edge of Razer then had touched my chin,
Nor downy shade approached my supple Skin;
I knew not the postures of this Indian vapor,
Nor made my Sacrifice unto my Taper;
I Would never seen any Curtain nor partition,
Which beget work for Surgeon and Physician;
I was a Novice in the School of Sin,
Nor yet did taste, what others dived in.
Excuse this Subject then, if it do not fit
The niceness of this Age for weight and wit.
Birds flicker first before they learn to fly,
And trust me on my credit so did I.
" Great Tasks when they are to shorter times confined,
" Will force a Work mount lower than the mind.
Ad Viatorem.
OPpida dum peragras, peragran^ do Poemata spectes,
Spectando titubes, Barnabe, nome^ habes.
To the Traveller.
Towns while thou walk'st, and see this poetry,
And seeing stumblest, thou art Barnabe.
Ad Translatorem.
PEssimus est Cerdo, qui transtulit ordine calvo,
Non res sed voces percutiendo leves.
Ast hic Translator corii peramabilis Actor,
Quirythmo pollens fit ratione satur.
To the Translator.
THat paltry Patcher is a bald Translater
Whose aule bores at the Words but not the matter:
But this TRANSLATOR makes good use of lether
By stitching ryme and reason both together.
Index Operis.
MUlciber, Uva, Venus, redolens ampulla, Silenus,
Effigiem titulis explicuere suis.
The Index of this Work.
VUlcane, Grape, Venus, Bottle, Silen's hook,
Have all explained the title of this Book.
SIc me Parnassi deserta perardua dulcis
Raptat amor --
THus through vast Deserts, promontories wild,
Parnassus love draws Bacchus only child.

MIRTILUS and FAUSTULUS Interlocutores.
MIRTIL. O FAUSTULE, tend palmam,
Accipe calicem vitibus almam;
Tu ne vinctus es dol^re?
We tinctus sis color.
Sperne opes, sperne dapes,
Merge cur^s, recte sapis.
O Faustule, dic amico
Quo in loco, quo in vico,
Sive campo, sive tecto,
Sine linteo, sine lecto,
Propinasti, queis tabernis,
An in Terris, an Avernis?

FAUSTUL. O Mirtile, baculum fixi
Mill locis ubi vixi,
In pistrinis, in popinis,
In Coquinis, in Culinis,
Huc, and illuc, istic, ibi,
Hausi potus, plus quam cibi.
In progressu Boreali,
Vt process^ ab Australi,
Veni Banbery, O prophanum!
Vbi vidi Puritanum,
Felem facient^m furem,
Quis Sabbatho stravit Murem.
Veni Oxford, cui comes
Est Minerva, sons Platonis;
Vnde scatent peramoene
Aganippe, Hippocrene;
Totum fit Atheniense,
Imo Cornu Reginense.
Inde Godstow cum ^micis,
Vidi Tumbam Meretricis;
ROSAMUNDAM tegit humus,
Pulvis and umbra corpore sumus:
Sic qui t^get, quae togetur,
Ordine certo sep^lietur.
Inde Woodstock, quo spectandum
Labyrinthum memorandum
Ferunt, sed spectare nollem,
Reperi vivam Hospitem mollem;
Gratior soeiis est jocundis,
Mill mortuis Rosamundis.
Veni Brackley, ubinatus
Stirpe vili Magistratus,
Quem conspexi residentem,
Stramine tectum contegentem,
Et me vocans, " Male agis,
" Bibe minus, ede magis.
Veni Daintre cum puel^a,
Procerum celebre duello,
Ibi bibi in Caupona,

Prima nocte mill modis
Flagellarunt me Custodes*
Pelle spar^i sunt liv^res
Meo^ castigaere mores.

Si non omnes vidi stultos,
Nam scrutando reperi unam
Salientem contra Lunam,
Alteram ni^idam puellam
Offerentem porco sellam.
Veni Mortimeriados morti dos, gloria pulvis,
Atria sunt frondes, nobilis Aula seges.
Nunc gradus anfractus, cisterna fluenta spadonis,
Amplexus vermes, oscula mista rogis.
Clamat tempus edo, vocemque repercutit Ecco,
Sed nunquam redeo, voce resurgit Ego.
O vos Horoes attendite fata sepulchris,
Heroum, patriis qui rediere thoris!
Non estis luti m^lioris in orb Superbis;
Hi didicere mori, discite morte sequi.

Nottingam, tyrones

Instar Robin Hood and Servi
Scarlet, and Johannis Parvi;
Passim, sparsim peculantur,
Cellis, Sylvis depraedantur.
Veni Mansfield, ubi noraem
Mulierculam decoram,
Cum qua ^udum feci pactum,
Dediictum, egi actum,

Conspicuis vallis obsitae, fixa palis.

Overbowles, ubi Dani,
Dani
Habitarunt tempore Jani;
Patet oppidan^s callis
Circum circa clausus vallis,
Castris, claustris, and speluncis
Tectus coecis, textus juncis.
Sacra die eo veni,
Aedes Sanctae erant plenae,
Quorum percitus exemplo,
Quis Hospes erat Templo,
Intrans vidi Sacerdotem,
Igne fatuo poculis notum.
Glires erant incolae villae,
Iste clamat, dormiunt illi;
Ipse tamen vixit itae,
Si non cord, vest trita;
Fortem praese ferens gestum,
Fregit pedib^s Fragmina suggesti sacrarunt fercula festi.
Lucret.

Pransum redeunt, unus horum,
Pl^bem sequor non Pastorem.

Quae me Hospitem tractat b^ne
Donec restat nil crumenae.
Veni Rothram usque Taurum,
Et reliqui ibi aurum,

Quo pudore pulsus, docte
Clam putabam ire nocte.
Veni Doncaster, ubi sitam
Vidi levem and Levitam,
Quae vieta and vetusta,

Cupit tamen penetrari,
Pingi, pungi, osculari.
Veni Eo tempore, quo in hoc pauperiore Vico hospitium suscepimus, quidam
Acicularius, e grege praecaeteris, fam^ egregius, aciculari pulvere suffecatus
interiit: In cujus memoriam hoc inseriptum comperimus Epitaphi^.

-- o Mors crud^lis
Quae tuis telis
Artificem stravisti,
Qui meliorem
Erasit pulverem
Quam tu de eo fecesti.

Aberford, ubi notum
Quod aciculis emunt potum,
Pauperes sunt and indigentes,
Multum tamen sitientes;
Parum habent, nec habentur
Vlla, quae non tenet venture.
Veni Wetherbe, ubi visam
Clari Ducis meretricem.
Amplexurus, porta strepit,
Et strependo Dux me cepit;
Vt me cepit, aurem v^llit,
Et praecipitem foris pellit. In Corneolo Angiportu,
Subamoeniore Horto
Speciosa manet scorta,
Meretricia Procans sporta.

Vbi quaerens Georgium Grenum,
Non inveni, sed in lignum
Fixum reperi Georgii signum,
Vbi allam bibi feram,
Donec Georgio fortior eram,
Veni Bradford, cessi foris,
In Familiam Amoris,
Amant istae and amantur,
Crescunt and multiplicantur,
Spiritus instructi armis,
Nocte colunt opera carnis.
Veni Kighley, ubi monte
Minitantes, vivi fontes,
Ardui colles, aridae valles,
Laetitamen sunt Sodales,
Festivantes and jucundi,
Ac si Dominiessent Mundi.
Veni Giggleswick, parum frugis
Profert tellus clausa jugis;
Ibi Egremio collis saliens scatet unda parennts,
Quae fluit and refluit, nil tamen aestus habet.

vena prope viae
Fluit, refluit, nocte, die,
Neque norunt vnde vena,
An a sale vel arena.
Veni Clapham, unus horum
Qui accivit voce forum,
Primae hora ut me visit,
Mihi Halicem promisit;
Halicem mihi, calicem ei,
Pignus i^ amoris mei.
Veni Ingleton, ubi degi
Donec fabri caput fregi,
Quo peracto, in me ruunt
Mulieres, saxa plunnt,
Queis perculsus, timens laedi,
Hi^ Posteriorae dedi. Pirgus inest fano, fanum sub atumine Collis,
Collis ab elatis actus and auctus aquis.


Veni Lonesdale, ubi cernam
Aulam factam in Tabernam;
Nitidae portae, nivei muri,

Cura dignum nihil vident.
Veni Cowbrow, vaccae collem,

Queis jurando sum mansurus,
Donec Barnabe rediturus.

MIRTILUS and FAUSTULUS inter-speakers.
^IRTIL. O FAUSTULUS, stretch thy hand out,
Take thy Liquor, do not stand out;
Art thou pressed with griping dolor?
Let the grape give thee her color.
^read's a binder, wealth's a miser,
^rinke down care, and thou art wiser.
^ Faustulus, tell thy true heart,
^n what Region, Coast, or New part,
^ield or Fold thou have been bousing,
without linen, bedding, housing,
^n what Tavern, pray thee show us,
^ere on Earth, or else below us?

^AUSTUL. O Mirtilus, I will show thee,
Thousand places since I saw thee,
In the Kidcoat I had switching,
In the Tap-house, Cook-shop, Kitching,
^his way, that way, each way shrunk I,
^^ttle eat I, deeply drunk I.
(...) my progress traveling Northward,
^^king my farewell oth' Southward,
(...) Banbery came I, O profane one!
^here I saw a Puritane-one,
^^nging of his Cat on Monday,
^^r killing of a Mouse on Sunday.
(...) Oxford came I, whose Copesmato
(...) Minerva, Well of Plato;
^^om which Seat do stream most seemlie
^anippe, Hipp^crene;
^^ch thing there is the Muses Minion,
^ueenes College-Horn speaks pure Athenian.
Thence to Godsto, with my Lovers,
Where a Tomb a Strumpet covers;
ROSAMUND lies there interred,
Flesh to dust and shade's compared,
Lie he'bove, or lie she under,
To be buried is no wonder.
^ence to Woodstock I resorted,
^here a Labyrinth's reported,
(...) of that no'count I tender,
^und an Hostess quick and slender:
^^d her Guests more sweetly ^ying,
^^an a thousand Rosamunds dying*
from thence to Brackley, as did beseem one,
^he May'r I saw, a wondrous mean one,
^^tting, thatching and bestowing
^n a Wind-blowne house a strowing,
^n me, called he, and did charm me,
Drink less, eat more, I do warn thee.
^ence to Daintree with my Jewel,
^mous for a Noble Duel,
^here I drunk and took my Common
^a T^phouse with my Woman;
^hile I had it, there I paid it,
^ll long chalking broke my credit.
^hence I came to the Bel^ at Leister,
^here my brains did need a plaster;
first night that I was admitted,
(...) the Watchmen I was whipped,
^^ack and blew like any tetter
^eat I was to make me better.
^hence to Gottam, where sure am I,
though not all fools I saw many;
^ere a She-gull found I prancing,
and in Moonshine nimbly dancing,
^here another wanton madling
^ho her Hog was set a sadling.
^hence to Brave Mortimer's now dead, his glory dust,
His Courts are clad with grass, his Hall with rust.
His stairs steep steps, his Horse-t^oughs cisterns are,
Worms his embraces, kisses ashes share.
^ime cries, I eat, and Ecco answers it:
^ut gone, e're to return, is held unfit.
O Heroes of these Heroes take a view,
They Are to their fathers gone, and so must you!
Of better clay you are not than these men,
And they are dead, and you must follow them.

Nottingam, where rovers,
^igh-way riders, Sherwood drovers,
^^ke old Robin-Hood, and Scarlet,
^r like Little John his varlet;
^ere and there they show them doughty,
^ells and Woods to get their booty.
Thence to Mansfield, where I knew one,
That was comely and a true one,
With her a naked compact made I,
^er long loved I, with her laid I,
Town and her I left, being doubtful
Lest my love had made her fruitful.
Thence to In Ianus time was Danus seated here,
As by their pales and trenches may appear.

Overbowles, where * Danus
Dwelt with his Danes in time of Ianus;
Way to th'Towne is well disposed,
All about with trenches closed,
Pallisado's hid with bushes,
Rampires overgrowne with rushes.
(...) a Feast day came I thither,
^hen good people flockt together,
^here induced by their exemple,
^^pair'd unto the Temple;
^here I heard the Preacher gravely
^ith his Nose pot-tipt most bravely.
^ormise-like the people seemed,
though he cride, they sleeping dreamed;
^^r his life, tho there was harm in it,
^eart was less rent than his garment;
^ith his feet he did so thunder
^s the The fragments of which pulpit they were pleas't
To sacrifice to the ashes of their Feast.
Lucret.
pulpit fell asunder.
^^ch occasi^n having gotten,
^ awake, the pulpit broken;
^^e the Preacher ^ay sore wounded,
(...) more boords than beards surrounded,
^o dinner, who might fas^er,
among them I left Pastor. ^^y you, good Townsmen, sacred Springs affect,
^^t not your Preacher read, and you negl^ct.


^ence to Clown came I the quicker,
^ere I Would given my skin for liquer,
^e was there to entertain us
(...) Nogging of Vulcanus,
(...) afford't me welcome plenty,
(...) my seame-rent purse grew empty.
^^ence to the Bull at Rothram came I,
^here my gold, If I had any,
^ft I, long I stoutly rored
^ll oth' Bridge I broke my forehead,
^hence ashamed while brows smarted,
^y Nightime thence departed.
^^ence to Doncaster, who will believe it!
^^th a Light-one and a Levite
^^ere I viewed; too too aged,
(...) to love so far engaged,
(...) on Earth she only wished
(...) be painted, pricked, kissed.
Thence to At such time as we sojourned in this poor Village, it chanced that a
certain Pinner, and one of the choicest of all his Flock, being choked with
pin-dust, dyed: To whose Memory we find this Epitaph indorsed.

-- o cruel Death
To rob this man of breath,
Who whilst he lived in scraping of a pin.
Made better dust, than thou have made of him.

Aberford, whose beginning
Came from buying drink with pinning;
Poor they are and very needy,
Yet of liquor too too greedy;
Have they never so much plenty,
Belly makes their purses empty.
Thence to Wetherbe, where an apt one
To be Tweake unto a Captain
I embraced, as I gat it,
Door creek'd, Captain took me at it,
Took me and by the Ears he drew me,
And headlong down stairs he threw me* Near Horne-Alley in a Garden
A wench more wanton than Kate Arden
Sojourns, one that scorns a Wast-coat,
Wooing Clients with her basket.


Turning thence, none could me hinder
To salute the Wakefield Pinder;
Who indeed's the worlds glory,
With his Cumrades never sorry,
This the cause was, lest you miss it,
Georgies Club I meant to visit.
Straight at Wakefeeld was I seen a,
Where I sought for George a Green a,
But I could find no such creature,
On a sign I saw his feature:
Where the strength of ale so stirred me,
I grew stouter far than Geordie.
^hence to Bradford, my tongue blisters
^t the Family of Sisters,
They love, are loved to no Eye-show,
They increase and multiply too,
^urnis^'d with their spritely weapons
(...) flesh feels Clarks are no Capons.
Thence to Kighley, where are mountains
Steepy-threatning, lively fountains,
Rising Hills, and barraine valleis,
Yet Bon-Socio's and good fellows,
Joviall-jocund-jolly Bowlers,
As they were the world Controulers.
Thence to Giggleswick most sterill,
Hemmed with rocks and shelves of peril;
Near to the way as Traveller goes,
A fresh Near the bottom of this Hill, close by the way
A fresh Spring Ebs and Flows all hours oth'day.

Spring both Ebbes and Flows,
Neither know the Learnd'st that travel
What procures it, Salt or Gravel.
Thence to Clapham, drawing nyer
He that was the common Crier,
To a breakefast of one Herring
Did invite me first appearing.
Herring he, I drink bestowed,
Pledges of the love we owed.
Thence to Ingleton, where I dwelled
Till I brake a Blacksmiths palled,
Which done, women rushed in on me,
Stones like hail showered down upon me,
Whence amated, fearing harming,
Leave I took, but gave no warning. The poor man's box is in the Temple set,
Temple on Hill, th'Hill is by waters bet.


Thence to Lonesdale, where I viewed
An Hall which like a Tavern showed;
Neat Gates, white Walls, naught was sparing*
Pots brim-full, no thought of caring:
They eat, drink, laugh, are still mirth-making,
Naught they see that is worth care taking.
^hence to Cowbrow, truth I Will tell ye,
^ine hostess had a supple belly,
^odie plumpe, and countenance cheerful,
^eeling pace (a welcome fearful)
^ike a drunken Hag she stumbled,
^ill she on her buttocks tumbled.
^hence to Natland, being come thither,
^e who Yorks Contempts did gather
Gave me harbor, light as fether
We both drunk and eat together,
Till halfe-typsy, as it chanced,
We about the Maypole danced.
Thence to Kirkland, thence to Kendall,
I did that which men call Spendall,
Night and day with Sociats many
Drunk I ale both thick and clammy.
" Shroud thy head, Boy, stretch thy hand too,
" Hand h'as done, head cannot stand to.
Leaving these, to Staveley came I,
Where now all night drinking am I,
Always frolic, free from yellows,
With a Consort of good fellows,
Where I Will stay and end my journay,
Till Brave Barnabe returne-a.

FINIS.
Upon Bacchus Bush and Barnabees Nose, an Epigram, or Nose twitching Dilemme.

Let Bacchus bush be Barnabees rich Nose.
No Bush, no Garland needs of Cipresse green,
Barnabees Nose may for a Bush be seen.

Of Bear and Bush thou smellest all the year.

" Sobrius similis apparet Agno,

Multo fortior, and illaesum
Puto me capturum Rhesum;
Sed ne tibi gravior essem,
Nunc descendam ad progressum.
Primo occurrit peragranti
Scinditur ^ clivo Turris, bitumine murus;
Moenia sic propriis sunt reditura rogis.

Oppidum Johannis Ganti,
Seeds nota and vetusta,
Mendicantibus onusta,
Janitorem habens qualem
Mundus vix ostendet talem.
Veni Ashton, ubi vinum,
Militem, and Heroinam,
Clarum, charum, and formosam,
Damam, domum speciosam
Vidi, mersi mero Musam,
Done^ pes amisit usum.
Veni Garestang, ubi male
Intrans forum Bestiale,
Forte vacillando vico
Huc and illuc cum amico,
In Iuvencae dorsum rui,
Cujus cornu laesus fui.
Veni Preston, ductus eram
Ad bacchantem Banisterum,
Ac si una stirpe nati,
Fratres fuimus jurati;
Septem dies ibi mansi,
Multum bibi, nunquam pransi.
Veni Euxston, ubi hospes
Succi plena, corpore sospes,
Crine Sparso, vultu blando,
At halit^ (proh) nefando,
Qua relicta cum ancillis,
Me ad lectum duxit Phyllis.
Veni Wiggin prope coenam,
Ad hospitulam obscoenam;
Votis meis fit secunda,
Ebria fuit and jocunda;
Sparsit anus intellectum,
Me relicto, mi^xit lectum.
Veni Newton in Salictis,
Vbi ludens chartis pictis
Cum puella speciosa,
Cujus nomen erat Quam Rosa spiravit! sed ^doribus Aquilo flavit,
Et rugas retu^it quas meminisse dolet.

Rosa,
Centi-pede provocavi
Ad amandum quam amavi.
Veni Warrington, profluentes
Rivos ripas transeuntes
Specto^s, multo satius ratus
Mergi terris quam in aquis,
Vixi laute, bibi let,
Don^e aqua^ signant metae.
Veni Budworth usque Gallum,
Vbi bibi fortem allam,
Sed ebrietate captus,
Ire lectum sum coactus;
Mihi mirus affuit status,
Ad^obus sum portatus.
Sed amore captus grandi
Visitandi Thomam Gandi,
Holmi petii Sacellum,
Vbi conjugem and puellam
Vidi pulchr^s, lieet sero
H^^ neglexi, mersus mero.
Hinc ad Tauka-Hill perventum,
Collem valde lutu^entum,
Faber mihi been notus
Mecum bibit donec potus,
Quo relicto, Cythera sponte
Cornua fixit Lemnia front.
Novo-Castro Subter linum,
Mulsum propinavi vinum;
Nullus ibi fit scelestus,
Vox cl^mantis in suggestis;
Portas castitatis frangunt,
Qu^^ extincta luce tangunt.
Veni Stone ad Campanam,
Vidi ^ mell^a, mea Delia*

Deliam non Dianam;
Hic suspectam habens vitam
Pastor gregis, Iesuitam
Me censebat, sed in certas
Nil invenit praeter chartas.
Haywood properans malignam,
Nocte praeparat aprugnam
Mihi Hospes; sed quid restat?
Calices ^aurire praestat:
Nullum Baccho gratius libum,
Quam mutare potu cibum.
Veni Ridgelay, ubi Faber,
Cui liquor Summus labor,
Mecum bibit; Nocte data
Mihi m^tula perforata,
Vasis crimine detecto,
Fit Oceanus in l^cto.
Veni Bruarton, Claudi domum,
Vbi querulum audiens sonum,
Conjugem virum verberantem,
Et vicinum equitantem;
Quo peracto, frontem lini
Spuma byne instar vini.
Inde Cautibus, arboribus, cinaris, frondentibus herbis,
Crevit in Ecclesiam vallis opima tuam.

Lichfield properab^m,
Vbi quendam invitab^m
Perobscaenum opibus plenum,
Ad sumendum mecum coen^m;
Hausto vino, acta coena,
Solvit divitis crumena.
Veni Colesill, ad macellum,
Vbi in cervisiam cell^m
Forte ruens, cella sorde^,
Vxor mul^et, ursa mordet;
Sed ut Lanius fecit focum
Lectum, dereliquilocum.
Veni Meredin, Meri-die,
Vbi longae fessus viae,
Hospitem in genu cepi,
Etulterius furtim repi;
Cum qua propinand^ mansi,
Donec sponsam sponsum sensi.
Veni Coventre, ubi dicunt
Quod Caeruleum filum ^exunt,
Ego autem hoe ignoro,
Nullum enim empsiforo,
Nec discerni juxta morem,
Lignum, lucem, nec colorem.
Veni Dunchurch per la^rones
Ad lurcones and lenones,
Nullum tamen timuihorum,
Nec la^ronem, nec liqu^rem;
Etsi Dives metu satur,
Cantet vacuus Viator.
Mane Daintre ut venissem,
Corculum quod reliquissem,
Avide quaerens per musaeum,

Barnabees JOURNALL.

The second part.

By Gorymboeus.

Ore-flowing Cups whom have they not made learned?
Barnabees Iournall, The Second Part.
MIRTIL. FAUSTULUS! happily returned;
Tell me, pray thee, where th'st joarned;
What Towns, villages thou have viewed,
What Seats, Sites or States were showed;
Sure thou know the North's uncivil,
Small good comes thence, but much evil.

FAUSTUL. WHat I was once, same I am now,
Hair, conditions, garments same too,
Yea there is no man justly doubts,
These the same shoes I went out with;
And for comb I never used any,
Lest I lost some of my Meney.
But attend me, and partake it,
What I loved, what I hated,
England amongst all Nations, is most-full
Of hills, wells, bridges, Churches, women, wool.

Bridges, fountains, mountains, valleis,
Cauls, cells, hillocks, highways, shallows,
Paths, towns, villages and trenches,
Chast-choice-chary-merry wenches.
Truth I Will tell thee, nothing surer,
Richer am I not, nor poorer,
Gladder, madder nor more pleasing,
Blither, brisker, more in season,
Better, worser, thinner, thicker,
Neither healthfuller nor sicker.
For the world I so far prize it,
But for Liquor I Would despise it,
Thousand deaths I Would rather dye too
Than hold Ale mine Enemy too:
" Sober, Lamb-like do I wander,
" Drunk, I Am stout as Alexander.
When my head feels his Maeander,
I am stronger than Lysander;
Th'Ile of Ree I little fear it
Without wound to win and wear it;
But lest tedious I express me,
To my Progress I Will address me.
First place where I first was knowne-a,
Was brave John a Gants An ancient Arch does threaten a decline,
And so must strongest Piles give way to time.

old Towne-a,
A Seat* anciently renowned,
But with store of Beggars drowned:
For a Iaylor ripe and mellow,
The world h' as not such a fellow.
Thence to Ashton, good as may be
Was the wine, brave Knight, bright Lady,
All I saw was comely specious,
Seemly gracious, nea^ly precious;
My Muse with Bacchus so long traded,
When I walked, my legs denaid it.
Thence to Garestang, pray you hark it,
Entering there a great Beast-market,
As I jogged on the street-a
'Twas my fortune for to meet-a
A young Heyfer, who before her
Took me up and threw me over her.
Thence to Preston, I was led-a,
To brave Banisters to bed-a,
As two borne and bred together
We were presently sworn brether;
Seven days were me there assigned,
Often I supt, but never dined.
Thence to Euxston, where mine Hostess
Feels as soft as any tossed is,
Jucy, lusty, countenance toothsome,
Braided hair, but breath most loathsome;
Her I left with locks of amber,
Phyllis light me to my chamber.
Thence to Wiggin about Supper,
To an Hostess, none more slutter,
Buxome was she yet to see to,
She Would be drunk for company too;
Wit this Beldam soon did scater,
And in Bed distilled her water.
Thence to Newton in the Willows,
Where being boulstred up with pillows,
I at Cards played with a girl
Fresh was my Rose, till by a Northwind tossed,
She sap, sent, verdure, and her vigor lost.

Rose by name, a dainty pearl,
At Cent-foot I often moved
Her to love me whom I loved.
Thence to Warrington, banks or'eflowed,
Travelers to th'Towne were rowed,
Where supposing it much better
To be drowned on Land than Water,
Sweetly, neatly I sojourned
Till that deluge thence returned.
Thence to Cock at Budworth, where I
Drunk strong ale as brown as berry,
Till at last with deep-healths felled,
To my bed I was compelled;
I for state was bravely sorted,
By two Poulterers supported.
Where no sooner understand I
Of mine horest Host Tom* Gandi,
To Holme Chapel forthwith set I,
Maid and Hostess both were pretty,
But to drink took I affection,
I forgot soon their complexion.
Thence to Tauke-a-Hill resort I,
An hill steepy, slippery, durty;
Smith with me being well acquainted
Drunk with me till 's wits were tainted,
Having left me, Venus swore it,
She Would shooe-horn her Vulcans forehead.
At New Castle under line-a,
There I trounc'd it in burned wine-a;
None oth' Wicked there remained,
Weekly Lectures were proclaimed:
Chastity they roughly handle,
While blind zeal snuffs out the candle.
Thence to the Bell at Stone straight draw I,
o my honey-suckle Delia*

Delia no Diana saw I;
By the Parson I was cited
Who held me for Jesuited;
In his search, the door fast locked,
Naught but Cards were in my pocket.
Thence to Haywood taking flight-a,
The Hostess gave me brawne at night-a;
But what is that unto the matter?
Whiskins sorted with my nature:
To brave Bacchus no gift quicker
Than oblations of strong liquor.
Thence to Ridgelay, where a Blacksmith,
Liquor being all he would take with,
Boused with me; midnight waking
And a looking-glass there taking,
Chamber Pot was hol'd quite through,
Which made me lie wet till morrow.
Thence to Bruarton, old Claudus
Did approve us and applaud us,
Where I heard a woeful bleating,
A cursed wife her husband beating;
Neighbor rode for this default-a,
While I did my front with malt-a.
Thence to Enclosed with cliffs, trees, Sciences, Artichokes,
The fruitful vale up to thy Temple looks.

Lichfield went I right on,
Where I chanced to invite one,
A Curmudgeon rich but nasty
To a supper of a pasty.
Having sipt, and supt, and ended,
What I spent, the Miser lended.
Thence to Colesill, to a Shamble
Like an old Fox did I amble,
To a cellar, troth I Will tell ye,
Fusty, musty, headlong fell I;
But the Butcher having made-a
Th'fire his bed, no more I staid-a.
Thence at Meredin appear I,
Where grown surfoot and sore weary,
I reposed, where I chuckt Jone-a,
Felt her pulse, would further gone-a;
There we drunk, and no guest crossed us,
Till I took the Host for th'Hostesse.
Thence to Coventre, where it is said-a
Coventre blew is only made-a;
This I know not, for sure am I
In no Market bought I any;
Bacchus made me such a Scholar,
Black nor blew, I knew no color.
Thence to Dunchurch, where report is
Of pimps, punks a great resort is,
But to me none such appeared,
Bung nor Bung-hole I never feared;
Though the rich Chrone have fears plenty,
Safe he sings whose purse is empty.
At Daintre early might you find me,
But not the Wench I left behind me,
Near the Schoole-house where I ^oused,
Her I sought but she was spoused,
Which I having heard that night-a,
"Farewell (quoth I) Proselyta.
Thence to Wedon, there I tarried
In a Wagon to be carried;
Carriers there are to be found-a,
Who will drink till the world run round-a:
" Pay, good fellows, I Will pay naught here,
" I have My queasy stomach making bold,
To give them that it could not hold.

left more than I brought here.
Thence to Tosseter on a Tuesday,
Where an artfull Batchler chus'd I
To consort with; we never budged,
But to Bacchus revels trudged;
All the Night-long sat we at it
Till we both grew heavy pated.
Thence to Stratford where Frank Green is my name from him whom I obey,
But tho my name be Green, my head is gray.

Green-a,
Daintiest Do that e're was seene-a,
Venus varnish me saluted,
But no beauty long can suit it;
Beauty feeds, beauty fades,
Beauty lost, her wooer vadeth.
Holding on my journey longer,
Straight at Brickhill with TOM. YOUNGER.
I arrived; one by this cheese-a
Styled the eighth wiseman of Greece-a,
Voice more sweet than Prognes sister,
Like a Torch his nose does glister.
To Hocklayhole as I approached,
Scylla's barmy cell I broached,
Dark as the Cave of Pluto's station,
Or Laverna's habitation;
Quaffing there while I could stand-o,
Madder grew I than Orlando.
Thence to Dunstable, all about me;
Mice within, and Thieves without me;
But no fear affrights deep drinkers,
There I tossed it with my Skinkers;
Not a drop of wit remained
Which the Bottle had not drained.
Thence to Redburne, where were Players,
None of Roscius active heirs;
Prologue crowned with a Wreath of Iuy,
Jetted like an Ape most lively:
I told them sitting at the Actor. Even as in a ban a-quet are dish^es
Of Sun-dry ta-ast.

Go mend it thou knave, go mend it.


banquet
They should be canvas'd in a blanket.
From thence with a stomach empty
To the town of Here Alban was; his Tomb, his Title too;
"All Albion show me such an Alban now.

Albane went I,
Where with wine I was so undon,
As the Hand which guides to London
In my blind hand I received,
And her more acquaintance craved.
Thence to the Purse at Barnet known-a,
There the Bears were come to Town-a;
Two rude Hunks, it is troth I tell ye,
Drawing near them, they did smell me,
And like two misshapen wretches
Made me, ay me, wrong my bretches.
Thence to Highgate, where I viewed
Seven Hills there were in Rome, and so there be
Seven Sights in New-Troy crave our memory:
1 Tombs, 2 Guild Hall Giants, 3 Stage-plaies, 4 Bedlam poor,
5 Ostr^ch, 6 Beare-garden, 7 Lions in the Tower.

City I so dearly loved,
And the Horn of Matriculation
Drunk to th'freshmen of our Nation,
To his memory saluted
Whose branched head was last cornuted.
Thence to Hollowell, Mother red cap,
In a troop of Trulls I did hap;
Whoors of Babylon me impalled,
And me their Adonis called;
With me toy'd they, buss'd me, culled me,
But being needy, out they pulled me.
Thence to Islington at Lion,
Where a juggling I did spy one,
Nimble with his Mates consorting,
Mixing cheating with his sporting;
Creeping into th'Case of's vial
Spoiled his juggling, made them fly all.
Country left; I in a fury
To the Axe in Alder-Bury
First arrived, that place slighted
I at Rose in Holborne lighted,
From the Rose in flaggons sail I
To the Griphin in the Old-Bayly.
Where no sooner do I waken,
Than to Three Cranes am I taken,
Where I lodge and am no starter
Till I see the Summer quarter;
Pert is FAUSTULUS and pleasing,
Cup brimfull, and corpse in season.
Yea, my merry mates and I too
Often to the Cardinals Hat fly to,
Where to Hearts Horns we carouse it,
As Minerva does infuse it,
But Actaon sick oth' yellows
Mewes his wife up from good fellows.
Under the Sign of Pipe still fuming,
And the Bush for ever flaming,
Mulciber the motion moving,
With Nose-burning Master shaming:
A Shop neighboring near Iacco,
Where Young vends his old Tobacco,
As you like it, sometimes sealed,
Which impression since repealed,
As you make it, he will have it,
And in Chart and Front engrave it:
Harmless but no artlesse end
Cloze I here unto my Friend.

FINIS.
Upon the Errata's.
BE^wixt Hawke and Buzzard, o man,
After th'Phraze of speech so common,
Having seen this Journall at print,
I found these Erata's in it;
Which if thou correct (Kind Reader)
Nectar by thy Muses feeder.
From the head unto the foot
Naught but Error, look unto't.
^his observation have I found most true,
^rring, I learn mine Errors to subdue.
NOw Venus pure Veins are with Wines inflamed,
Now Venus full Veins are by wines restrained,
For Venus swollen Veins are by Morphuus chained,
From folly wained.

Lento cursu petii Waltham,
In hospitium Oswaldi,

Saevior factu^ sum quam Aper,
Licet vini lenis sapor.
Veni Hic repetunt ortum tristissima funera Regum,
Quae lachrymas oculis excutiere meis.

Pomfrait, ubi miram
Arcem, Regibus Anglorum dedit arx tua dirae ruinam,
Hoc titulo fatum cerne S::::: tuum.

Anglis regibus diram;
Latius in rupem Laser est sita dulcis arentem,
Vest nova Veris floribus aucta novis.

Laseris ortu celebrandam,
Variis gestis memorandam:
Nec in Pomfrait REPENS certior,
Quam pauperculus inertior.
Veni Sherburne, adamandum,
Et aciculis spectandum;
Pastor decimas cerasorum
Quaerit plus quam animorum:
Certe nescio utrum mores,
An fortunae meliores.
Veni Bramham, eo ventus,
Vidi Pedites currentes;
Quidam auribus susurrat,
" Creed Faustule, hic praecurret,
" Nam probantur: Qui narratur
Pejor, melior auspicatur.
Veni Tadcaster, ubi pontem
Sine flumine, praelucentem,
Plateas fractas, and astantes
Omni loco mendicantes
Spectans, illinc divagarer,
Ne cum illis numerarer.
Veni Eboracum, flore
Iuventutis cum Textore
Fruens, conjux statim venit,
"Lupum vero auribus tenet;
Ille clamat aperire,
Illa negat exaudire.
Sic ingressus mihi datur,
Cum Textori denegatur;
Qui dum voce, importune
Strepit, matulam urinae

Dum Betricia mecum jacet*
Ibi Tibicen apprehensus,
Iudicatus and suspensus,
Plaustro coaptato furi,
Ubi Tibia, clamant pueri?
Nunquam ludes amplius Billie;
At nescitis, inquit ille.
Quod contigerit memet test,
Nam abscissa jug^lo rest,
Vt in fossam Furcifer vexit,
Semi-mortuus resurrexit:
Arce reducem occludit,
Vbi valet, vivit, ludit.
Veni Towlerton, Stadiodromi
Retinentes spem coronae,
Ducunt equos ea die
Iuxta tramitem notae viae;
Sequens autem solitam venam,
Sprevi primum and postremum.
Veni Helperby desolatum,
Igne nuper concrematum,
Ne taberna fit intacta,
Non in cineres redacta;
Quo discessi ocyor Euro,
Restinguendi sitim cura.
Veni Labentes rivi resonant sub vertice clivi,
Quae titulum villae primo dedere tuae.
Alias. Infra situm Rivi saliunt sub acumine clivi,
Quo seeds civi splendida, nulla nivi.

Topcliffe, musicam vocans,
Et decore ordine locans,
Vt expectant hi mercedem,
Tacit subtraexi pedem;
Parum babui quod expendam,
Linquens eos ad solvendum.
Veni Thyrsis oves pascens perapricae pascuae vallis,
Prima dedit Thyrsco nomina nota suo.
Sycomori gelidis Tityrus umbris
Discumbens, Phyllidi Serta paravit,
Et niveas greges gramine pavit.

Thyrske, Thyrsis hortum,
Vbi Phyllis floribus sportam
Instruit, at nihil horum
Nec pastorem, neque florem
Ego curo, Bacchum specto
Horto, campo, foro, tecto.
Veni Alerton, ubi oves,
Tauri, vaccae, vituli, ^oves,
Aliaque Campi pecora
Oppidana erant decora:
Forum fuit jumentorum,
Mihi autem cella forum.
Veni Smeton, perexosum
Collem quem pediculosum
Vulgo vocant, tamen mire
Moechae solent lascivire,
Ad alendum dehilem statum,
Aut tegendam nuditatem.
Veni Littora lentiscis, gemmarunt germina gemmis,
Murenulis conchae, muricibusque comae.

Nesham, Dei donum,
In Coenobiarchae domum;
Vberem vallem, salulirem venam,
Cursu fluminis amoenam,
Laetam sylvis and fr^ndosam,
Herae vultu speciosam.
Veni Darlington, prope vicum
Conjugem dux^ peramicam;
Nuptiis celebrantur festa,
Nulla admittuntur moesta;
Pocula noctis dant progressum,
Ac si nondum nuptus essem.
Veni Nomen habes mundi, nec erit sine jure, secundi,
Namque situs titulum comprobat ipse tuum.

Richmund, sed amicos
Generosos and antiquos,
Nobiles socios, sortis mira,
Cum nequissem invenire,
Sepelire cur as ibi,
Tota nocte mecum bibi.
Poena sequi solet culpam,
Veni Redmeere ad Subulcum,
Ilia mensae fert porcina,
Priscanimis intestina,
Quae ni calices abluissent,
Adhuc gurgite inhaesissent.
Veni Carperbie peravarum,
Coetu frequens, victu carum;
Septem Solidorum coena
Redit levior crumena:
Nummo citius haurieris,
Quam liquore ebrieris.
Veni Wenchly, valle situm,
Prisca vetustate tritum,
Amat tamen propinare
Pastor cum agnellis chare,
Quo effascinati more,
Dormiunt Agnicum Pastore.
Veni Middlam, ubi arcem
Vidi, and bibentes sparsim
Bonos socios, quibus junxi,
Et liquorem libere sumpsi;
Aeneis licet tincti nasis,
Fuimus custodes pacis.
Veni Gurgite praecipiti sub vertice montis acuti
Specus erat spinis obsitus, intus aquis.

Ayscarth, vertice montis,
Valles, and amoenos fontes,
Niveas greges, scopulos rudes,
Campos, scirpos, and paludes
Vidi, locum vocant Templum,
Speculantibus exemplum.
Veni Worton, sericis cincta

Veni, vidi, vici, lusi,
"Cornu-copiam optans Duci.
Veni Bainbrig, ubi palam
Flumen deserit canalem,

Qui tremula mulcet voce, sopore fovet.

Hardraw, ubi fames,
Cautes frugis perinanes;

Lautam, loetam, and jocundam,
Sed mutatur mundus totus,
"Vix in anno unus potus:

Veni Arboribus gelidam texens Coriatius umbram,
Aestatem atque Hyemem fronde repelle gravem.

Killington, editum collem,

Barnabees JOURNALL. The Third part.

By Corymboeus.

Full-blowne my veins are, and so well they may,
With brimming healths of wine drunk yesterday.
Barnabees JOVRNALL. His Northern Journey: Third part.
MIRTIL. WHup (FAUSTULUS) all draw ny thee
That do love thee, or loved by thee,
Joying in thy safe returning!
Leave Court, care, and fruitless mourning;
Way thou have walked, pray thee show it,
Where thou have lived, what thou have viewed.
Not the Ephesian Diana
Is of more renoumed fam-a;
Acting wonders all invent thee,
Painters in their Statues paint thee;
Banish fear, remove delay-man,
Show thy self a famous Way-man.

FAUSTUL. LEave delay, and be not fearful!
Why; who e're saw me less cheerful
When I was by Fortune cuffed,
Or by Fortunes smiles so puffed,
As I showed my self far prouder
Than when she more scornful showed her?
For the world, I would not prize her,
Yea, in time I should despise her,
Had she in her no good fellow
That would drink till he grew mellow;
Draw near and hear, thou shall have all,
Hearing, joy in this my travall.
First day having drunk with many,
To Islington from London came I,
Journey long and grievous wether,
Yet the Evening brought me thither,
Having t'ane my pots by the fire,
Summer sand was never dryer.
Thence to Kingsland; where were feeding
Cattle, Sheep, and Mares for breeding;
As I found it, there I feared
That my Rozinant was wear'ed:
When he would jog on no faster
Loose I turned him to the pasture.
Thence to Totnam-high-crosse turning
I departed before next morning;
Hostess on her Guests so doted
Faustulus was little noted;
To an Hay-loft I was led in,
Boords my bed, and straw my bedding.
Having thus left High-Crosse early,
I to Waltham traveled fairly,
To the Hospital of Oswald,
And that Princely Seat of This seat, this royal object of the sight,
Shall it for ever bid the World, good night?
Where our preceding Kings enjoyed such bliss,
And sealed their amorous fancies with a kiss!

Th'bald;
There all night I drunk old Sack-a
With my bed upon my back-a.
Of the Kings House at Tibbals.
Thence to Hodsdon, where stood watching
Cheats who lived by conicatching,
False Cards brought me, with them played I,
Dear for their acquaintance paid I;
Before a Justice they appeared;
Them he praised, me he jeered.
Thence to Ware, where mazie Amwell
Mildly cuts the Southern Channel;
Rivers streaming, banks resounding,
Middleton with wealth abounding:
Mightily did these delight me;
"O I wished them Aqua vitae!
Thence to Wademill, where I rest me
For a pot, for I was thirsty;
On me cryde they and did hout me,
And like Beetles flockt about me:
" Buy a Whip Sr! no, a Laddle;
" Where Is your Horse Sr? where your Saddle?
Thence at Puckridge I reposed,
Hundred Beggars me enclosed;
" Beggars, quoth I, you are many,
" But the poorest of you am I;
They no more did me importune
Leaving me unto my fortune.
Thence to Buntingford right trusty,
Bedrid Host, but Hostess lusty,
That can chat and chirp it neatly,
And in secret kiss you sweetly;
Here are Arbours decked gaily,
Where the Buntin warbles daily.
Thence to Roiston, there grass grows,
Medes, flocks, fields the plowman sows,
Where a pious Prince frequented,
Which observing, this I vented:
" Since all flesh to Fields, floods, wastes, woods, Dear, Dogs, with
well-tuned cry,
Are sports for Kings, yet Kings with these must dye.

Fate's a debtor,
" Retchlesse wretch, why liv'st no better?
Thence to Caxston, I was led in
To a poor house, poorer bedding,
Some there were had me suspected
That with plague I was infected,
So as I starke-naked drew me,
Calling th'Hostesse straight to view me.
Thence to Cambridge, where the Muses
Haunt the Vine-bush, as their use is;
Like sparks up a Chimney warming,
Or Flies near a Dunghill swarming,
In a Ring they did enclose me,
Vowing they would never lose me.
'Bout midnight for drink I call Sr,
As I had drunk naught at all Sr,
But all this did little shame me,
Tipsy went I, tipsy came I:
Grounds, greenes, groves are wet and homely,
But the Scholars wondrous comely.
Thence to An aged Oak takes of this Town survey;
Finds Birds their Nests, tells Passengers their way.

Godmanchester, by one,
With a Clowd as was Ixion,
Was I gulled; she had no fellow,
Her soft lips were moist and mellow,
All night vowed she to lie by me,
But the giglet came not ny me.
Thence to Huntington, in a cellar
With a wench was there a dweller
I did bargain, but suspected
By the Host who her affected,
Down the stairs he hurr'ed quickly,
While I made me too too sickly,
Thence to Harrington, be it spoken!
For Namesake I gave a token
To a Beggar that did crave it
And as cheerfully receive it:
More he need't not me importune
For 'twas the utmost of my fortune.
Thence to Stonegatehole, I Will tell here
Of a story that befell there,
One who served an Attorney
T'ane with beauty in his journey,
Seeing a Coppice hastens thither
Purposely to wanton with her.
As these privately conferred,
A Rover took him unprepared,
Searched his Port-mantua, bound him faster,
And sent him naked to his Master:
Set on's Saddle with hands tied,
Th'Horse he neyed, Man he cried.
Th'Atturney when he had discerned
One, he thought, behind him armed
In white Armor, stoutly sturr'd him,
For his Jade he keenly spurred him:
Both run one course to catch a Gudgeon,
This Nak't, that frighted to their lodging.
Singing along down Here of the whip a Covetous Priest did lick;
Who would not bury the dead, was buried quick.
Nothing more memor^ble than that Chapel of Sautry, rete^ning still with her
that Covetous Priests memory.

Sautry laning,
I saw a Tomb one had been lain in,
And inquiring, One did tell it,
'Twas where Rainsford buried ^h' Prelat:
I saw, I smiled, and could permit it,
Greedy Priests might so be fitted.
To the Newfounded College came I,
Commended to the care of many;
Bounteous are they, kind and loving,
Doing whatsoe're's behoving:
These hold and walk together wholly,
And state their Lands on uses holy.
Whether pure these are or are not,
As I know not, so I care not;
But if they be dissembling Brothers,
Their life surpasses many others:
See but their Cell, School and their Temple,
You Will say the Stars were their exemple.
Thence to Stilton, slowly paced,
With no bloome nor blossom graced,
With no plums nor apples stored,
But bald like an old man's forehead;
Yet with Innes so well provided,
Guests are pleased when they have tried it.
Thence to Wansforth-brigs, a river,
And a wife will live for ever;
River broad, an old wife jolly,
Comely, seemly, free from folly;
Gates and gardens neatly gracious,
Ports and Parks and pastures spacious.
^eeing there, as did become me,
Written, LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME,
On the Portels, I departed,
^est I should have sorer smarted;
Though from death none may be spared,
(...) to dye was scarce prepared.
On a Hay-cock sleeping soundly,
The River rose and took me roundly
Down the current; people cried,
Sleeping, down the stream I hyed;
Where away, quoth they, from Greenland?
No; from Wansforth-brigs in England.
Thence to This house the Levarets bush.

Burleigh, though 'twas winter,
No fire did the Chimney enter,
Buttries without Butlers guarded,
Stately gates were dooble-warded;
Hoary Ivy the Chimneis trophy.

Chimneyes without smooke too,
Hungry Kitchins without Cook too.
Hallowing loud, o empty wonder!
Ecco's the keeper of a forlorn house.
Ecco straight resounded, hunger.
Who inhabits this vast brick-house?
Ecco made reply, the Titmouse;
Ominous Cell, no drudge at home Sir!
Ecco answer made, Be gone Sir.
Thence to ancient Where be thy Masters? Fellows? Scholars? Bursers?
O Stamford to thy shame, they are all turned Purs^rs.

Stamford came I,
Where are pencelesse purses many,
Neatly wrought as does become them,
Less gold in them than is on them:
Clawbacks more do not assail me,
Than are Beggars swarming daily.
Though my cares were maine and many,
To the The Drunkards cave, for so it may be called,
Where many Malt-worms have been soundly mall'd.

Hole of Sara came I,
Once a bona-roba, trust me,
Though now buttock-shrunke and rustie;
But though nervy-oyle and fat-a,
Her I caught by you know what-a.
^aving boldly thus adventured,
and my Sara's socket entered,
^er I sued, suited, sorted,
^ussed, bouzed, sneesed, snorted:
^ften sat she, when she got up
^ll her phraze was, "Drink thy pot up.
Thence to Witham, having red there
That the fattest Eele was bred there,
Purposing some to entangle,
Forth I went and took mine angle,
Where an huge one having hooked,
By her headlong was I dooked. Maeanders shores to Lethe's shadows tend;
Where waves sound cares, and banks imply our end.


Thence to ^ may compare this Town, and be no liar,
With any shire for Whetstones and a Spire.

Grantham I retiring,
^amous for a Spire aspiring,
There a Pastor with his sweeting
(...) a chamber closely meeting;
(...) great fury out he flung there
Cause a Popish picture hung there.
Here the Townsmen are amated
That their Spire should be translated
Unto PAUIS; and great's their labor
How to purchase so much paper
To enwrap it, as is fitting,
To secure their Spire from splitting.
Thence to A sandy plat a shady Elm receaves,
Which cloths those Turrets with her shaken leaves.
Here all along lies Bevars spacious Vale,
Near which the streams of fruitful Trent do fall.
Valleys three so fruitful be,
They Are the wealth of Britannie.

New-worke, flood-surrounded,
Where I hoping most were drowned,
Hand to hand I straightwayes shored
To a Cellar richly stored,
Till suspected for a picklock,
The Beedle led me to the whip-stock.
Thence to Tuxworth in the clay there,
Where poor Travelers find such way there;
Ways like bird-lime seem to show them,
Seats are Syrts to such as know them;
The Ivy hangs there, long has't hong there,
Wine it never vended strong there.
Thence to Retford, fish I fed on,
And to the adage I had red on,
With carouses I did trim me,
That my fish might swim within me,
As they had done being living,
And in the River nimbly diving.
Thence to Scrubie, o my Maker!
With a Pastor and a Taker
Day I spent, I night divided,
Thief did make me well provided:
My poor Scrip did cause me fear him,
All night long I came not near him.
Thence to Bautree, as I came there
From the bushes near the Lane there
Rushed a Tweake in gesture flanting,
With a leering eye and wanton;
But my flesh I did subdue it,
Fearing lest my purse should rue it.
Thence to That cur^'fie might a courtesy enforce,
The Mayre would bring the Lawyer to his horse:
You shall not, quoth the Lawyer; M. now I swear,
I Will to the gallows go. L. I Will leave you there,
Might not this Mayre for wit a second Pale-As
Have named the Town-end full as well as Gallows?

Doncaster, where reported
^ively Levit was departed,
love I loathed and spritely wine too,
Which I dearly loved sometime too:
^or when youthful Venus ageth,
(...) my fleshly force asswageth.
Thirst knows neither mean nor measure,
Robin Hoods Well was my treasure,
^n a common A Well, thorn, dish hung in an iron chain,
For monuments of Robin Hood remain.

dish enchained,
^ my furious thirst restrained:
and because I drunk the deeper,
^ paid two farthings to the keeper.
^hence to ^n a rock Want built her booth,
Where no creature dwells but Sloth.

Wentbrig, where vile wretches,
^ideous hags and odious witches,
^rithen countenance and misshapen
^re by some foul Bugbeare taken:
^hese infernal seats inherit,
Who contract with such a Spirit.
Thence to Ferrybrig, sore wearied,
^urfoot, but in spirit cheered;
^ the grape no sooner tasted
Than my melancholy wasted:
Never was wild Boar more fellish,
Though the wine did smally relish.
Thence to The Tragic stage of English Kings stood here,
Which to their urns pays tribute with a tear.

Pomfrait, as long since is,
Fatal to our Here stood that fatal Theater of Kings,
Which for revenge mounts up with aerie wings.

English Princes;
For the choicest Here Licorice grows upon their mellowed banks,
Decking the Spring with her delicious plants.

Licorice crowned,
And for sundry acts renowned:
A Louse in Pomfrait is not surer,
Then the Poor through sloth securer.
Thence to Sherburne, dearly loved,
And for Pinners well approved;
Cherry tenths the Pastor aymeth
More than the souls which he reclaimeth:
In an Equi-page consorting
Are their manners and their fortune.
Thence to Bramham, thither coming,
I saw two Footmen stripped for running;
One told me, " the match was made to cheat the^,
" Trust me Faustulus, This will beat'em,
" For we have tried them: but that Courser
He prized better, proved the worser.
Thence to Tadcaster, where stood reared
A fair Bridge, where no stood appeared,
Broken Pavements, Beggars waiting,
Nothing more than labor hating,
But with speed I hastened from them,
Lest I should be held one of them.
Thence to York, fresh youth enjoying
With a wanton Weaver toying,
Husband suddenly appears too
"Catching of the Wolf by The Ears too;
He cries open, something fears him,
But th'deafe Adder never hears him.
Thus my entrance was descried,
While the Weaver was denied,
Who as he fumed, fret, and frowned
With a chamber pot was crowned;
Wisely silent he never grudged
While his Betty with me lodged.
Piper being here committed,
^uilty found, condemned and titted,
she was to Knavesmyre going,
^his day, quoth Boys, will spoil thy blowing;
from thy Pipe thou art now departing;
^ags, quoth the Piper, you are not certain.
^ll which happened to our wonder,
^or the halter cut asunder,
^s one of all life deprived
^eing buried, he revived:
and there lives, and plays his measure,
^olding hanging but a pleasure.
Thence to Towlerton, where those Stagers
Or Horse-coursers run for wagers;
^eare to the high way the course is,
Where they ride and run their horses;
^ut still on our journey went we,
first, or Last, did like content me.
Thence to Helperby I turned
Desolate and lately burned,
Not a Taphouse there but mourned,
Being all to ashes turned,
Whence I swiftly did remove me
For thirst-sake, as did behove me.
Thence to Topcliffe from tops of cliffs first took her name,
And her cliffe-mounted seat confirms the same:
Where streams with curled windings overflowne
Bestow a native beauty on the town.

Topcliffe, music called I,
In no comely posture failed I,
But when these expected wages,
To themselves I left my Pages;
Small being the curt'sy I could show them
Th'reckning I commended to them.
Thence to Here Thyrsis fed his Lambkins on the Plain,
So Thyrske from Thyrsis took her ancient Name.
Here Tityrus and Phyllis made them Bowers
Of tender Osyers, sweet-breathed Sycomours.

Thyrske, rich Thyrsis casket,
Where fair Phyllis fills her basket
With choice flowers, but these be vain things,
I esteem no flowers nor Swainlings;
In Bacchus yard, field, booth or cottage
I love naught like his cold pottage.
Thence to Alerton, rankt in battle,
Sheep, Kine, Oxen, other Cattle,
As I fortuned to pass by there
Were the Towns best beautifier:
Fair for Beasts at that time fell there,
But I made my Fair the Celler.
^hence to Smeton, I assailed
^^wsy Hill, for so they call it,
^here were dainty Ducks, and gant ones,
^enches that could play the wantons,
which they practice, truth I Will tell ye,
^or relief of back and belly.
Thence to Where shores yield Lenticks, branches pearled gems,
Their Lamprels shells, their rocks soft moffy stems.

Nesham, now translated,
Once a Nunnery dedicated;
^allies smiling, Bottoms pleasing,
^treaming Rivers never ceasing,
^eckt with tufty woods and shady,
Graced by a lovely Lady.
Thence to Darlington, there I boused
Till at last I was espoused;
Marriage feast and all prepared,
Not a fig for the world I cared;
All night long by the pot I tarried
As if I had never been married.
Thence to From a Rich mound thy appellation came,
And thy rich seat proves it a proper name.

Richmund, heavy sentence!
There were none of my acquaintance,
All my noble Cumrads gone were,
Of them all I found not one there,
But lest care should make me sicker,
I did bury care in liquor.
Penance chased that crime of mine hard,
Thence to Redmeere to a Swine-heard
Came I, where they nothing plast me
But a Swines-gut that was nastie,
Had I not then washed my liver,
In my guts't had stuck for ever.
Thence to Carperbie very greedy,
Consorts frequent, victuals needy;
After Supper they so tossed me
As seven shillings there it cost me:
Soon may one of coin be soaked,
Yet for want of liquor choked.
Thence to Wenchly, Valley-seated,
^or antiquity repeated;
^heep and Shepherd as one brother
Kindly drink to one another;
Till pot-hardy light as feather
Sheep and Shepherd sleep together.
Thence to Middlam, where I viewed
Th'Castle which so stately showed;
Down the stairs, it is truth I tell ye,
To a knot of brave Boys fell I;
All red-noses, no dye deeper,
Yet not one but a peace-keeper.
Thence to Here breaths an arched cave of antique stature,
Closed above with thorns, below with water.

Ayscarth, from a mountain
^ruitfull valleys, pleasant fountain,
Woolly flocks, cliffs steep and snowy,
^ields, f^nns, sedgy rushes saw I;
Which high Mount is called the Temple,
^or all prospects an exemple.
Thence to Worton, being lighted
I was solemnly invited
By a Captains wife most vewlie,
Though, I think, she never knew me;
I came, called, coll'd, toy'd, trifl'd, kissed,
"Captain Cornu-cap'd I wished.
Thence to Bainbrig, where the River
From his channel seems to sever,
To Maidenly John I forthwith hasted,
And his best provision tasted;
Th'hoast I had (a thing not common)
Seemed neither man nor woman.
Thence to A Channel strait confines a crystal spring,
Washing the walls oth' village neighboring.

Askrig, market noted,
But no handsomnesse about it,
Neither Magistrate nor Mayor
Ever were elected there:
Here poor people live by knitting,
To their Trading, breeding fitting.
Thence to A shallow Rill, whose streams their current keep,
With murmuring voice and pace procure sweet sleep.

Hardraw, where is hard hunger,
Barraine cliffs and clints of wonder;
Never here Adonis lived,
Unless in Coals Harbor hived:
Ins are nasty, dusty, fustie,
Both with smoke and rubbish mustie.
Thence to Gastile, I was drawn in
To an Alehouse near adjoining
To a Chapel, I drunk Stingo
With a Butcher and Domingo
The I asked him what is a Clock? He looked at the Sun:
But want of Latin made him answer -- Mum.

Curat, who to my discerning
Was not guilty of much learning.
Thence to Here grows a bush in artfull mazes round,
Where the active organs of my brain were drowned.

Sedbergh, sometimes joy-all,
Gamesome, gladsome, richly royal,
But those jolly boys are sunken,
"Now scarce once a year one drunken:
There I durst not well be merry,
Far from home old Foxes werry.
Thence to Here the retired Tanner builds him bowrs,
Shrowds him from Summers heat and winters showrs.

Killington I passed,
Where an hill is freely grassed,
There I staid not though halfe-tyred,
Higher still my thoughts aspired:
Taking leave of Mountains many,
To my native Country came I.
^hence to Kendall, pure her state is,
^rudent too her Magistrate is,
^n whose charter to them granted
nothing but a Now Saturns year h'as drenched down care,
And made an Alderman a Mayre.

Mayor wanted;
^ere it likes me to be dwelling,

The fourth part.

By Corymboeus.

If thou do love thy flock, leave off to pot.
Barnabees JOVRNALL. His Northern Journey: The Fourth part.
MIRTIL. O FAUSTULUS, takes't no pity
For the Field to leave the City?
Nor thy Consorts, lively Skinkers,
Witty wags, and lusty Drinkers,
Lads of life, who wash their liver
And are dry and thirsty ever?
Will thou here no longer tarry
With these Boys that love Canarie?
Will thou leave these nectar trenches,
Dainty Doxes, merry wenches?
Say, what makes thee change thy ditty,
Thus to take farewell oth'City?

FAUSTUL. WHat is it makes me? do not note it
How I have in the Tavern floted,
Till a thousand seek to shame me,
There goes Faustulus, so they name me,
Who through all the World traced,
And with Style of Maltworme graced!
Who carouseth to his breeding
From Aurora's beamelins spreding
To the Evening, and despises
Favor, thrift which each man prizeth!
Now hear Faustulus melancholy,
The clozing Scene of all his folly.
Farewell Banbery, farewell Brackley,

Farewell Tauk-hill, which I viewed,
Lemnian Lydia, whom I sewed,
Steepy ways by which I waded,
And those Trugs with which I traded,
Faber, Taber, pensive never,
Farewell merry Mates for ever.
Now I hate all foreign places,
Robin Hoods Well and his chaces,
Farewell Rosington, farewell Retford,
And thou ancient seat of Bedford,
Farewell Dunchurch, Dunstable, Brickhill,
Alban, Barnet, Pimlico, Tickhill.
Farewell Waltham, Seat of Oswald,
That bright Princely Star of The'bald,
Farewell Godmanchester, where I
Was deluded by a Fairy,
Farewell Kingsland, Islington, -- These be my New Troyes dying Elegies.
Now to that New Troy bid adue for ever,
Wine, Venus, Pictures, can allure me never,
These are youths darlings, ages hoary griever,
Fare ye well ever.
Farewell for ever, see you will I never,
Yet if Wife, Children, Meney hurry thither,
Where we may plant and solace us together,
Welcome for ever.

London,
Which I loved, and by it undon.
Farewell Buntingford, where are Thrushes,
Sweet Briers, Shred vines, privet bushes,
Hostess cheerful, mildly moving,
Giving tokens of her loving;
I must in another Nation
Take my fill of recreation.
Farewell precious Stone, and Chapel
Where Stella shines more fresh than the apple,
Farewell Haywood, Bruarton, Ridglay,

With wit, wealth, worth, Well of Plato.
Farewell York, I must forsake thee,
^ervers shuttle shall not take me,
Hoary hayres are come upon me,
Youthful pranks will not become me;
^h'bed to which I Am reconciled
shall be by me never defiled. Winter h'as now behoar'd my hairs,

^^byllis for verses little cares,

^oets, when they have writ of love their fill,
^rowne old, are scorned, though fancy crown their quill.

Horse-Faires.
To Malton come I, praising th'saile Sir,
Of an horse without a tail Sir,
Be he maimed, lamed, blind, diseased,
If I sell him, I Am well pleased;
Should this Javell dye next morrow,
I partake not in his sorrow.
Then to Rippon I appear there
To sell horse if they be dear there,
If good cheap, I use to buy them,
And ith'Country profit by them;
" Where to quicken them, I Will tell ye,
" I put quick Eeles in their belly.
Northern Faires.

And with Rods of Licorice sweetly smile

Thence to Topcliffe with my fellow,
Not to bouze Wine but to sell-lo;
Thence to Thyrske, where Bullocks grazed,
Are for sale ith'market placed.
Thence to Allerton cheerful, fruitful,
To the Seller very grateful,
There to choose a place I Am chariest,
Where my beasts may show the fairest;
Thence to Darlington, never swarving
From our Drove-lawes, worth observing.
Thence to Middlam am I aiming
In a direct course of gaining,
I refuse no kind of labor,
Where I smell some gainful savor;
" No way, be it never the homeliest
" Is rejected being honest.
Tra-montane Faires.
In these Faires if I find nothing
Worthy staying, I Am no slow thing,
To the North frame I my passage
Winged with hope of more advantage:
Ragged rocks, and steepy hillows
Are by gain more soft than pillows.
Thence to native Applebie mount I,
Th'antient Seat of all that County;
Thence to pearelesse Penrith went I,
Which of Merchandise has plenty;
Thence to Roslay, where our Lot is
To commerce with people Scottish.
By a passage crooktly tending,
Thence to Ravinglasse I Am bending;
Thence to Dalton most delightful;
Thence to oaten Ouston fruitful;
Thence to Hauxides Marish pasture;
Thence to th'Seat of old Lancaster.
Thence to Garestang, where are feeding
Herds with large fronts freely breeding;
Thence to Ingleforth I descended,
Where choice Bull-calfs will be vended;
Thence to Burtons boundiers pass I,
Fair in flocks, in pastures grassie.
Thence to Hornebie, Seat renouned,
"Thus with gain are worldlings drowned;
Secret-sacred thirst of treasure
Makes my Bullocks my best pleasure;
Should Love woo me, I Would not have her,
"It is gain yelds sweetest savor.
Thence to Lonesdale, where were at it
^oyes that scorned quart-ale by statute,
Till they staggered, stammer'd, stumbled,
Railed, reeled, rolled, tumbled,
Musing I should be so stranged,
I resolved them, I was changed.

MIRTIL. SUrely (FAUSTULUS) I do wonder
How thou who so long lived under
Bacchus, where choice wits resou^ded,
Should be thus in the world drowned.
What do, where liv'st, in brief deliver,
Will thou be a worldling ever?

Now to Richmund, when Spring's coming,
Now to Nesham with my woman,
With free course we both approve it,
Where we live and are beloved;
Here fields flower with freshest creatures
Representing Flora's features.
Now to Ashton I Am invited
By my friend and kinsman cited,
Secret cellars entertain me,
Beauteous-beaming Stars inflame me,
Meat, mirth, music, wines are there full,
With a countenance blithe and cherefull.
Now to Cowbrow, quickly thither
Joviall boys do flock together,
In which place all sorrow lost is,
Guests know how to kiss their hostess,
Naught but love does border near it,
Goose or Hen will witness bear it.
Now to Natland, where choice beauty
And a Shepherd do salute me,
Lips I relish richly roseack,
Purely Nectar and Ambroseack;
But I Am chaste, as does become me,
For the Countries eyes are on me.
Now to Kirkland, truly by it
May that Say be verified,
"Far from God, but near the Temple,
Though their Pastor give exemple,
They are such a kind of vermin,
Pipe they would rather hear than Sermon.
Now to Kendall, for A Town so highly renouned for her commodious clothing,
and industrious Trading, as her name is become famous in that kind. Camb. in

Let life, state, style improve thy charter there.

And her four and twenty brothers,
Ever in her honor spreading,
Where I had my native breeding.

^ought makes them or me ought sorry,

Now to Staveley straight repair I,
Where sweet Birds do hatch their airy,
Arbours, Osyers freshly showing
With soft mossie rind or'e-growing:
For woods, air, ale, all excelling,
Would thou have a neater dwelling?

MIRTIL. Be It so Faustulus! there repose thee,
Cheer thy Country with thy posie;
Live, farewell, as thou deservest,
Rich in Arethusa's harvest;
Under the Beach while Shepherds rank thee
Zephyrus bless thee.
FAUST. I do thank thee.

FINIS.
HEre in the Country live I with my Page,
Where Tmolus Cups I make my golden age.

Ceres send corn, with corn add grapes unto it,
Poet to wine, and long life to the Poet.

Reader, think no wonder by it,
If with Town I Have Town supplied,
If my meeters backward nature

BEllula Bella, mi puella,

Nec amo, nec amor, nec amavi.

In amoribus ad co^eundum.

Perge Damaetas, nunc prurit aetas,

Demitte pecus si Bellam petas,

Quaecunque nubit and u^o cubat,
Et amo, and amor, and amavi.

DAMAETAS. ELIZA-BELLA. DAM. 1.
MY bonny Bell, I love thee so well,
I would thou wad scud a lang hither,
That we might here in a Cellar dwell,
And blend our bows together!
Dear a'rt to me as thy geere's to thee,
The World will never suspect us,
This place it is private, it is folly to drive it,
Loves Spies have no eyes to detect us.

BELL. 2.
Trust me Damaetas, youth will not let us,
Yet to be cing'd with loves taper,
Bonny blithe Swainlin intend thy Lamkin,
To requite both thy lays and thy labor.
I love not thee, why should thou love me,
The yoke I cannot approve it,
Then lie still with one, I Would rather have none,
Nor I love, nor am loved, nor have loved.

DAM. 3.
To lead Apes in hell, it will not do well,
It Is an enemy to procreation,
In the world to tarry and never to marry
Would bring it soon to desolation.
See my countnance is merry, cheeks red as chery,
This Cover will never suspect us,
This place it is private, it is folly to drive it,
Loves Spies have no eyes to detect us.

BELL. 4.
Alas, maidens must feign it, I love though I lain it,
I would, but I will not confess it,
My years are consorting and feign would be sporting,
But bashfulnesse shames to express it.
I love not thee, why should thou love me,
That yoke I cannot approve it,
Then lie still with one, I Would rather have none,
Nor I love, nor am loved, nor have loved.

DAM. 5.
My beauteous Bell, who stars do excel,
See mine eyes never dries but do weat me,
Some comfort unbuckle my sweet honey-suckle,
Come away, do not stay, I entreat thee.
Delay would undo me, hye quickly un^o me,
This River will never suspect us,
This place it is private, it is folly to drive it,
Loves Spies have no eyes to detect us.

BELL. 6.
Come on Damatas, ripe age does fit us,
Take aside thy nak't Bride and enjoy her,
So thou coll thy sweeting, let flocks fall a bleeting,
My maids weed on thy meed I Will bestow there.
Thus love I thee, so be thou love me,
The yoke is so sweet I approve it,
To lie still with one is better than none,
I do love, I am loved, and have loved it.
