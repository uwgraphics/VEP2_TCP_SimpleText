MARY'S Exercise.

AT LONDON Printed by Thomas Este. 1597.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable and virtuous Lady, the Lady MARY Countess of
Penbrooke, Health, Happiness, and Heaven.
RIght Honorable, my bounden Service in all duty remembered, I have often red,
and heard, which I verelye beeleeue, that in the Nature of Man, there is no
greater blot of disgrace, then the vile note of ingratitude, with which wicked
humor, fearing my long forgetfullnesse of your favor, may make my heart in
some suspicion unhappily to be touched, I have presumed humbly to present unto
the fair eye of your discreet virtue a little fruit of my late, and best
labors; Wherein your Ladyship may vouchsafe to see, that, although I cannot
as I would find means, to discharge the care of my duty, yet in my best
thoughts I have not forgotten you, when in my daiely prayers unto God, I do
remember you: and, as I daiely and hourelye, do heartily pray unto his holy
Majesty, for his blessings to light upon you; so have I set down a few
historical prayers for you: Which, I hope, you will so find applied to your
comfort, as shall give you no coffeehouse, in the presumption of my pains:
and so though I have soncke my fortune in the world, having only the light of
virtue to lead my hope unto Heaven, with humble thancks for your as yet
undeserved favor, in continual prayers to the God of all comfort, for his
prosperous preservation, of my good L. your Ladyship, and all yours, with
increase of honor on earth, and eternal happiness in Heaven: I humbly take
my leave in bounden duty.

Your La: sometime unworthy Poet, and now, and ever poor Beadman. Nich. Breton.

TO THE LADIES and Gentlewomen Reeders.
LAdies and Gentlewomen, so it is, that having passed some parts of the world,
and beholding the stately palaces of diverse princes, after my return into my
native country, finding the contemplative life, the most near unto Angelical
nature, and no contemplatio^ so comfortable as the mercies of god, the first
fruicts whereof, and the never ending Glory of the same, are no where so
apparent as in the history of the holy scriptures: where looking into the
court of heaven, I find the world but a base corner, when the King of Kings,
with the brightness of his glory does ravish the souls of his beeloued: and
reading in this divine history of the excellency of Gods love, and among many
of his elected, of some women in his especial favor, I could not but acquaint
your good minds, with the memory of their names, and such matter touching them
as you may and will (I hope) apply to your comfort, I find them blessed for
their faith, and beeloued for their humility, two Jewels of the soul, not
common to our human nature, but as it is incorporated to christ, but I will
leave the imperfect to Gods amendment, the faithful to his blessing, and the
elected to his love: beeseeching him so to bless you with his grace, in the
feeling of his love, that in prayer to his mercy, ye may all live to his
glory, that having Christ for your love, ye may live in joy for ever: and so
wishing you happiness on earth, and heaven hereafter: I rest in prayer for ye
and all faithful in Christ Jesus: as I find cause.

Your poor friend or servant: N. B.

Mary's Exercise.
A prayer upon the history of Christ his coming unto the house of Mary and
Martha, to raise Lazerus from death. John. 11. The fruict thereof: The life of
the dead, the glory of God.
MOst merciful Lord, my loving king and everliving god, sweet Jesus Christ, my
heavenly master, redeemer, and Savior, vouchsafe me leave poor and unworthy
vessel of thy mercy, on the knees of my soul in the humility of my heart, to
trouble thy patience with the lowly petition of my afflicted spirit: Lord when
to make known thy glory to the world y^ came to Bethania, unto the house of
Mary and Martha, to raise up thy beloved lazarus from death, what was the
speech of the poor women, thy poor creatures unto thy gracious and holy
Glorious majesty? but only this: Lord, if thou had ben here, my brother
Lazarus had not ben dead: but now whatsoever thou ask of God he will give it
thee: so my dear Lord let me, I beseech thee, say unto thee? now that by the
gracious, merciful, and comfortable operation of thy holy Spirit, I feel, and
see thee coming to the unworthy house of my wounded soul, LORD if thou had
been here, not my brother, but my self had not so long been dead, dead I say
in my sins, though only live in thy mercy: but oh Lord thy father has given
all power into thy hands, and therefore, if it please thee, thou can raise me
from this sorrowful death, of iniquity, unto the joyful life of thy grace:
but as Martha said, by her brother Lazarus, he had been dead four days, and
therefore did so stinck that he was unfit to be taken up, so Lord, let me
say of my self, I have been dead not four days, but many years, yea, all
the days of my life, and therefore feel my self so unsavory, and unfit to
presume before thy presence, that I can rather say with Peter, come not near
me Lord, for I am a polluted creature, then think that ever thou did love
me, and therefore art come to raise me from this death: yet sweet lord when I
remember withal, thy blessed answer, and kind chiding of the unbelieving
soul, in these words: said I not unto thee if thou did believe thou
should see the glory of God: it gives me comfort in my fear to come humbly
to thy mercy; beseching thee so to strengthen my faith in thy inco^prehencible
power, that I may rather rejoice in feeling thy goodness and seeing thy glory,
then distrust in thy power, or despair in thy mercy: that by the virtue of
thy power, from the death of sin, being revived unto grace, in the true
fruicts of repentance, I may glorify thy holy name.

Amen.
An other prayer upon the same history Chapter and place: the fruict thereof:
Christ his commendation of the hearers of his word.
Almighty God and most merciful Lord, my best master and only sweet Savior
Jesus Christ, when it pleased thee of thy mercy, to enter into the house of
Martha and Mary, thy beloved unworthy servants, whiles Mary, by the blessed
inspiration of thy holy spirit, was happily called, and wholly inclined to the
attentive hearing and joyful receiving of thy comfortable preaching; MARTHA,
not so filled in heart or rather ravished in soul with the unspeakable sweetness
of thy holy spitit, rather troubling her head with an earnest care of worldly
business, then bending her heart with any zealous desire, to the inward seeking
of thy heavenly treasure, complained to thee of her sisters mistake^ and
mistermed idleness, that sitting still at thy feet she had no more care to
help her in her work, to provide for thy welcome, nor to attend thy presence:
but, my sweet Lord how sweetly did thou reprove her folly, and reveal her
fault in these few words: Martha Martha thou carest, and art troubled about
many things, but one thing is needful, Mary has chosen the good part, which
shall never be taken away from her: oh dear Master now that by the secret
light of thy gracious love, I behold thy entrance into the heart of my soul,
though I am not worthy thou should come under the roof of my house, yet,
since, it has pleased thy holy majesty in the infinite goodness of thy
incomparable kindness, to comfort my heart with the gracious hearing of thy
glorius mercy; give me leave not with Martha, to complain of a sister, but to
accuse my self of to much evil in so long combring my heart with the wretched
cares of this wicked world, that I have had almost no care to humble my soul
to the happy hearing of thy holy word: let me therefore beeseech thee of the
abundant grace of thy glorious goodness, by the mighty power of thy eternal
mercy, to draw me to thee by the heavenly virtue of thy hollie Spirit, that
casting of all the combersome cares of this uncomfortable world, I may not
only serve thee in body, on the knees of my heart, worshipping thy divine
will, but in the humility of my soul, sit with MARY on the ground with the
tears of true repentance to wash the feet of thy mercy: that being both
unable and unworthy to behold the glory of thy presence, I may yet joy in my
soul to hear the sweetness of thy preching, that being clearly healed of the
evil part of sin, I may receive that good part of thy grace, that may
never be taken from me: but one thing is needful, and that one thing art
thou: it is thee sweet LORD that I have need of: needful is thy grace, and
ungracious that I am, full of need am I of thy mercy: mercy my sweet Jesus, Oh
let my pensive heart here the preaching of thy mercy, that being with LAZARUS
revived, and with MARTHA rebuked, with Mary I may be so comforted, that with
the tears of my heart washing the feet of thy pity, I may rejoice in my
soul to be admitted into thy presence; wherein the obedience of my Love,
showing the Joy of my life, I may feed of thy mercy and singe to thy glory:
Blessed is the house that does receive thee, happy the heart, that does attend
thee, but most joyful the Soul, that leaving the cares of the world has all
her comfort but in thee: in thee I say sweet LORD, the light of the eternal
wisdom, the life of the dead, and the only comfort of the living; whose
preaching most gracious, and whose presence most glorious, happy are they that
hear, but most blessed that enjoy: among whom, alas, of the world most
unworthy, so bless the sick Soul of thy sinful wounded servant, that
overcome with the comfort of thy unspeakable kindenes, in the swounding trance
of the treasure of thy Love, I may rather dye at thy feet, then part a foot
from thy favor: where with the tears of faithes thanckfulnesse, I may
increase the Glory of thy Mercy.

Amen.
An other upon the same History, chapter and place, the fruit thereof: The
blessing of humility.
REmember sweet Lord Jesus thy Mercies that have been ever of old, forgive and
forget the sins of thy humble repentaunt, though unworthy servants, think on
thy poor Mary with the tears of her heart humbling her soul at thy feet,
think I say my sweet lord, a little upon my great misery, that confess my
self unworthy of the least look of thy Mercy: Lord, it pleased thee to
say, Marie Magdaline loved much, but surely thou louedst more, that so great
and unmeasurable a sinner, woldst vouchsafe so great a measure of thy Grace,
being unworthy, thy thought, to presume into thy presence: sweet JESUS, art
not thou the same CHRIST? who came not to justify the righteous, but to call
sinners to repentance? is thy mercy any thing diminished, or shall not thy
Glory ever increase? it cannot be, but thou art thy self, the Sun of GOD,
the Redeemer of the world, the Lamb of God, that take away the sins of
the world, and God alone, that have the government of the whole world: what
thou have bought then, who can take from thee? where thou have Mercy, who can
diswade thee? and having all things under thy feet, who can resist thee? Thou
Createdst man for thy self, thou Redeemedst him by thy self, and do comfort
him, but with thy self; will thou then forget the work of thine own hands?
will thou loose that thou have bought with thine own blood? or suffer it to be
blasted that y^ have blessed with thine own Spirit? no, sweet God, thy
goodness is to great to loose any part of thy Glory: though we forget thy
love, thou can not forget thy Mercy, though we loose our selves in this
wilderness, thou will bring us home to thy fold, and though sin seek to
drive us to despair, yet does thy Grace assure us of comfort; for thou art
kind, though we are unthankful, thou art merciful, though we are
unfaithful, yea thou art comfortable, when we are most miserable: and why is
all this? because thou art God, whose goodness has no limit, whose mercies
are infinite, and whose glory shall have no end: why then oh Lord is my Soul
so full of heaviness, and my heart so disquieted within me? can the world so
werie me, that Heaven cannot revive me? or can sin so infect me, that thy
mercy can not heal me? or the devil so terifie me, that thou my God can
not comfort me? no, my dear god, thou art able to forgive more then I am able
to offend, one drop of thy mercy, will heal all the wounds of my sin, and
where thou entrest with thy holly spirit, there is no place for the wicked
fiende: what then can hurt me if thou help me? can sin set a wall beetwixt
thy mercy and my comfort: when thou have trodden down the devil, with all the
power of his malice, can death afright me that see my life in thy love? or can
sorrow dismaie me that have thee for my comfort? no, my sweet savior, let
not my tears be only witness of my sorrow for my sins, but of my joy in
thy mercy, that from the greatness of sin, have called me to thy grace, and
living long from the shadow of thy blessing, have admitted me into the Joy of
thy presence: Oh blessed Lord how admirable do I feel thy goodness in the
inward works of thy grace? faith a fruict of thy mercy, repentance a fruict of
faith, tears a fruict of repentance, Joy a fruict of tears, and thou only
the fruict of all; thou art oh Lord ye sum of all sweetness, the substance
of all goodness, and in thy self to thy self the only height of all glory:
Thou art the joy of the heart, the comfort of the mind, and the life of the
soul: Thou art the portion of mine inheritance, the longing of my hearts love,
and the only heaven that I hope for: who can know thee and not love thee? or
know what love is, and is not ravished with the thought of thee? O my sweet
Savior, since it has pleased thee to call me unto thee, I humbly beeseech
thee, let me never go from thee, but let me live and die with thee, that I
may die to live with thee: for you only art the life, and the only life of
the^ that come unto thee: and to thee only do I come with sorrowful MARY
beeseeching thy comfort, in the greatness of thy goodness, so to inspire my
heart with the grace of thy holy spirit, that with ye tears of my soul mingled
with one drop of thy precious blood, I may wash away the filth of my
unsavory sin, and in the comfort of thy kindness, I may kiss the feet of
thy mercy, till out of the wretched vale of this worldly misery, thou will
bring me to the ioies of the elected in thy love, that there being preserved,
by the hand of thy mercy, with the Angels of thy train I may sing to thy
Glory.

Amen.
A prayer upon Elizabethes meeting with her cosen Mary the blessed virgin:
Luke i. Chap. 4. i. verse: The fruict thereof: The ioies of the elected that by
the love of grace are allied unto Christ.
IF all the treasures of the world were laid together, were they any better
then trash, compared (oh LORD) to the least thought of thy Love? are not the
Heavens them selves the works of thy singers? and is not the earth with all
her glory, most glorious in being thy footestoole? what the^ are we but
drossie creatures of slimy clay? but wherein thou have made us gracious, to
increase the greatness of thy glory: shall we then attribute unto our selves
that is due only unto thee? or thinck our selves to be any thing, that have
our being but in thee? wilful were such a blindness, and woeful were such a
sight, as taking night for the day, would seek paradise in hell: LORD keep us
from such a folly, clear us from such a blindness, and save us from falling
into such an error: be thou the light of our love, the sense of our
understanding, the wisdom of our knowledge, the meditation of our hearts, and
the joy of our Souls: but sweet LORD, I reed that when ELIZABETH met with her
cosen MARY the blessed Virgin thy blessed mother, the babe spra^g in her womb,
which after he came into the world, did preach of thy kingdom above the world:
and now me thincks, I feel thy holy Spirit making entrance into my Soul,
there rise up thoughts in my heart to honor thee in the highest Heavens; but
the thought is yet young, and cannot prosper without thy blessing, it is
conceived in my Soul by the blessing of thy grace, LORD preserve it with thy
mercy, that I may bring ir forth to thy glory: though when it is at the best,
as it is from me it is unworthy to loose the least latchet of thy shoe, yet as
it is from thee a gift of thy Goodness, at the Feet of thy mercy, let it
speak of thy glory: thy grace has begot it, let thy good spirit breed it,
and thy holy hand so preserve it, y^ being fed in this infancy with the sweet
milk of thy Mercy, it may gather such force, in the faith of thy holy word, yt
delighting in thy law, and living but in thy Love, it may loath the whole world
to be ye lest in thy kingdom: oh sweet Lord let my heart rejoice to here of
thee, my senses to serve thee, and my soul to praise thee, be thou ye child
of my love, the Lord of my life, and the life of my soul, let my soul ever
conceive thee and never part from thee: yt having thee for my comfort, I may
fear no cross, nor care for any calamity, be you swet Jesus my father, and my
child, my husband, and my brother, my love my life, my Lord and my god; in whom
my spirit may rejoice when I but thinck of thy blessing: that being wholly
ravished with the virtue of thy love, in harmony of thy graces, I may Glorify
thy holly name.

Amen.
A prayer upon the talk of Christ with the woman of Samaria. Ihon. 4. The
fruict thereof: the comfort of mercy.
PEereles love, and purest life of thy beloved, pardon I beeseech thee the
presu^ption of thy poor wounded creature, wounded with sin, and cureles of
her sore, but only in the merit of thy MERCY, in the oil of thy grace, and
wounds of thy love: oh sweet IESV, thou did vouchsafe at Jacobs well of the
woman of Samaria, to ask a little water; thou talkedst with her, and reueledst
thy self unto her, who unworthy of thy comfort could not conceive the greatness
of thy kindenes: but alas Lord, here is another woman that comes with
another thirst, and to drinck of another fountain: which fountain only art
thou alone, thou art the well of life, of which who drinks shall never dye:
long has my soul thirsted after thee, yea in a barraine and dry land where
no water is: oh that I might, so drinck of thy virtue, that being dronck with
thy love, I might be so moistened with thy grace, that I might never thurst
more after sin: oh sweet Jesus how sweet is thy sweetness, no heart can Imagine
nor tung can express; a fountain never dri, of the abundance of whose streams
all the blessed come to drink, all that drinck are in love, and all that love
do live for ever: such a spring never drying, such a love ever liueing, and
such a life ever ioying, where is it but in thee? and where art thou but it is?
oh fountain of all blessedness, oh blessing of all happiness, oh felicity of all
ioyfulnes, quench the fire of my thirst with one drop of thy grace, let fall
the dew of thy blessing upon the dry heart of my soul; that being refreshed
with thy love, I may deuote my life to thy service: for, sweet LORD, though
the woman of Samaria would not offer thee drinck, because the Samaritans would
not meddle with the jews, yet sweet Lord I am sure thou will not deny me thy
mercy, because I am a sinner: for thou have mercy in store for all them that
come unto thee, Jacob their father gave yt well as it seemed, to an discourteous
people, that would not give thee a cup of their water: but God thy father
has given thee to all people a fountain of life to all that in true faith
thirst to drinck of thy love: and how incomparable is thy kindness, that with
the blood of thy heart did seal the bond of thy love: do thou deny any
one comfort, that call all unto thy mercy: or do thou suffer any to
perish that put their trust in thy word? do thou not offer thy self freely?
and shall I not beg thee with tears? yes sweet Lord I humbly thanck thee, I
feel the sweetness of thy love, though I can not beeholde thy presence, I taste
of thy goodness though I see not thy person, and drinck of thy virtue though I
know not thine essence; for had not the medicine of thy mercy cured my soul of
her sorrow, I had died in my sin, ere I had tasted of thy grace, but
sweet-LORD, the woman of Samaria had many husbands, and my soul desires but
thy love, be thou I say the husband, of my love, the love of my life, and life
of my soul, the fountain of my faithes comfort, the water of my hopes life,
and the sweet of my eternal felicity: let me thirst only for thy grace,
drinck only of thy mercy, and live only to thy Glory: that from the puddles
of the world, delivered by thy mercy, in the ioies of paradise, I may sing
Halaluiah to thy holly Majesty:

Amen.
A prayer upon the woman of Canaan, her suite unto Christ: Math: xv. verse 22.
The fruict thereof: The blessing of faith.
Eternal, Almighty, everliving, and euerloueing God, my dearest master,
sweetest Lord, and only Savior JESUS CHRIST, the comfort of the sorrowful,
the hope of the faithful, and the life of the joyful, the Surgion of the
heart, the Physician of the mind, and the medicine of the soul, the power of
virtue the wisdom of grace, and the glory of mercy, who living in the heavens
beholdest all the dwellers upon ye earth, hear ye cries of the afflicted,
asswagest the pains of the tormented, and comfortest ye hearts of the
distressed, that in true faith of thy word, fly to the mercy of thy will;
among those miserable sinners, that have no hope of relief, but in the
heavenly eye of thy mercy, vouchsafe sweet Christ, to cast one look of pity
upon the wounded heart of my unworthy soul; when the woman of syrophenissa
came to thee, for the cure of her daughter, possessed with a devil, though at
the first, thou gave her a kind of denying answer, in that it was not meet
to give the Childrens meat unto dogs, yet to her humble reply, that the
dogs might eat of the crummes that fall from their masters table, to the glory
of thy mercy thou made a gracious Conclusion; wherein the humility of her
faith, had effected her joy in thy favor: her daughter was made whole, and
she departed away: but now oh Lord was she only blessed in this abundant
measure of thy mercy? or can sin have such power in the world, as to bar thy
servants thy blessing? or shall any despair of thy comfort, when thou call
all unto mercy? no, sweet Lord, I know thou art not partial in thy love, that
look only into thy self, thou art not sparing of thy blessing, that art
bou^tifull to the whole world, nor would the death of a sinner, and therefore
wilt surely have mecry on thy servants: to thee therefore sweet Jesus I humbly
come, not for my diseased daughter, but thy distressed daughter, unworthy of so
good a father, yet praying thee, good father help me, and thy unworthy servant,
beseeching thee sweet master comfort me, and thy unworthy creature, crying
unto thee oh God of all mercy have mercy upon me, in the multitude of thy
compassions do away all my offenses, in the oil of the grace heal my soul of
her sin, and in the power of thy mercy deliver me from evil, I know not with
how many devils I am daily and hourly tempted, by a world of illusions, to
be drawn from thy love, but, were there never so many, thou can deliver me
from them all; for, thy power is invincible, thy mercy is Almighty, and thy
love has no limits; sin is but an infection, the devils are but ministers
of thy wrath, and thou will have mercy on thy servants; heal therefore my
disease, command away my tormentors, and be glorious in thy goodness: where
thy good spirit enters, no evil spirit will bide, where thy grace touches,
no sin tarrieth, and whom thou inspirest with thy love, they are already in
heaven: but alas sweet JESUS me thincks I here thee accuse me of so dogged a
nature, that I am not worthy to feed of the fruict of thy favor, Lord I
confess it that while dogs wait one their masters trenchers, I have not
attended on the table of thy merry; and therefore am unworthy of the least crum
of thy comfort: yet sweet Lord, since thy mercy is over all thy works, put
me not out of the book of thy remembrance: thou have called me though I
come late, give me a penny of thy charity though I deseure nothing of thy
mercy: I am sick, and thou can heal me, be thou gracious though I be
sinful, the devil is a tirant, but thou art ye god of mercy, who with one
look of thine eye can make him fly from thy presence, with one word of thy
mouth can banish hi^ from thy beloved, and with one blessing of thy hand
can make me live ever: but, oh sweet LORD since I have by ^ine absence from
attending on thy table, de^erued not only to be famished, with lack of thy
comfort, and not to receive the least crum of thy mercy, yet in the least look
of thy love since thy glory is ^n thy mercy, loose no part of thy right: let
me come behind thee among the^ throng, of sinners, to touch the hem of thy
garment, that by the virtue of my faith, I may find grace in thy favor, and
being cured of my sin, and comforted by thy mercy by the grace of thy holly
spirit, I may Glorifiy thy holly name: and not with the Siroph^n^ssia^, depart
away with thy blessing, but with y^ joy of thy mercy, follow thy shadow with my
service, till being wholely delivered, from the temptation of sin, in the
salvation of thy mercy, with the elected of thy love, by the good spirit of thy
grace, I may ever sing to thy glory.

Amen
A prayer upon the widows two Mites: xii. of Mark 41 verse. The fruict
thereof the praise of Charity.
NOthing is more comfortable to my soul then the Meditation of thy mercy,
sweet Jesus, thou alone art he whom my soul loves, and just cause, for by thy
only love, my soul lives: when I behold thee in my heart, I have enough for
my comfort, and wanting thy grace, I comsume away with calamity: oh
unspeakable sorrow, to miss the joy of thy mercy, and how great is their
heaven, that have a feeling of thy love, oh sweet Lord, how greatly will thou
commend a little love in thy servant? but how infinitely art thou to be
glorified, that give thy self unto sinners: oh imco^parable kind love to
lay down the life of thy beeloued: thou did commend the poor widow, for
casting two mites into the treasury, and thou have given us thy self to bring
us into thy treasury: be thou therefore commended above all commendation: she
gave but a little, though all she had; you gave thy self, without whom all
things are nothing; let her then be commended of thee, who saw her heart,
and for thy bounty to the whole world, be thou glorified above the world: she
was called a poor widow, because she wanted both the wealth of the world
and the comfort of her kind husband, but how much might she be comforted, to
be commended by thy mercy? all comforts fail where thou art wanting, and all
ioies abound where thy comfott is coming: O comfort of comforts, when will thou
come unto me? LORD, thou art the husband of my soul, the only comfort of my
heart, and whole substance of my felicity: a poor widow am I, that wanting the
comfort of thy love, have no joy in my life: I have not a mite to present unto
thy mercy: had I a whole world, I would give it for thy grace: but, alas, I am
poor, and have thou any need of wealth? that have the whole world at
commandment: do thou care for dross, that art the LORD of heaven and
earth? no, LORD, thou want nothing, and therefore what though I have
nothing? thou have given me thy self, and can any thing take thee from me?
no sweet LORD, thou have said thou will have mercy, and not Sacrifice: a burnt
offering I know thou would not accept, if I should give it thee: but, if any
Sacrifice will please thee, a contrite heart, and a troubled spirit is that
which thou will not despise: with this sacrifice therefore sweet Jesus I come to
thee, beseeching thee, into the treasury of thy mercy, with the tears of my
heart, to receive me body and soul, which though less worth then one mite is
all that I have to give thee: and well is me, if thou will take them, to cure
them of sin, to ease them of sorrow, and to bring them to joy: but alas, I
give thee but thine own, which thou have bought with thy self, and therefore
I beeseech thee refuse not thine own, that belongs to none but thy self,
and therefore since I have nothing to give thee, take thine own unto thee,
commend whom it pleases thee, and be thou commended of all: of all I say, for
all and above all, since that for all in all, thou deseruest all commendation;
to thee sweet Jesus Christ the husband of my soul, the substance of my wealth,
the joy of my life, and assured hope of my salvation, that by the bitter death
of thy body, and precious blood of thy heart, have dearly bought the love of
thy servants, who by thy only merit being redeemed from hell, by the saving
faith of thy mercy, are assured of heaven, to thee I say, dear CHRIST, my
dear love, my best husband, my heavenly father my gracious LORD and only
glorious King, with thy heavenly father and thy holy spirit, he eternal trinity
in unity, one only almighrie and incomprehensible good god, for the infinite
comforts of thy infinite mercies, be all infinite glory, honor, and Praise world
without end.

Amen.
A prayer upon the request that the mother of James and John, made unto Christ:
Math: Chap: 20* The fruict thereof: Knowledge what to ask of God.
BLessed LORD, and Lord of all blessing, bountiful GOD, and GOD of all bounty,
King of heaven and earth, to whom all the world are but beggars; among the
infinite number of thy incessaunt suitors, y^ never leave to importunate thy
mercy, vouchsafe sweet IESV I beseech thee, to here an humble petition of thy
poor wretched and unworthy creature; The Mother of James, and John, made a
suite unto thee for her two sons, that the one might sit at thy right hand,
and the other at thy left: little was her discretion to move so presumptuous a
petition, little I say she considered thy greatness, or looked into her own
smalnesse, that, deserving nothing but thy Wrath, would crave such a blessing
of thy Grace: who being answered with denial, escaped well without thy
further displeasure: oh my GOD, I come not to thee with a spirit of such
boldness; but in the humility of faith, with the tears of sorrow, my wounded
heart, beecommeth a suitor to thy mercy; an humble suitor I am oh heavenly King to
thy holy Majesty, not for my two sons, but the two parts of my self, my
soul, and my body, y^ it will please thy gracious goodness, so far to take
them to thy mercy, as not to set them either at thy right hand, or thy left,
but in one look of thy comfort, to make the^ but cushins for thy feet: where
more joyful shall be my tears, to wash, the feet of thy favor, then all
the plesures of the world, to be away from thy mercy: this, oh LORD, is all my
suit, which in thy gracious pity I beeseech thee to grant me, that from this
vale of misery, thou will take me to thy mercy, that in the joy of thy love,
I may ever sing or thy glory:

Amen.
A prayer upon the devotion of Anna, Luke 2. Chap. The fruict thereof: The
comfort of prayer.
RIghteous LORD, holy KING, and everliving GOD, who have not to do with the
stool of iniquity, but, with thy Countenance do beehold the just,
forgiuest the sins of the Repentaunt, and take the faithful unto mercy.
Enter not, I beeseech thee into judgment with thy sinful and unworthy
servant; for, no flesh is righteous in thy sight: and I most unrighteous, am
ashamed to appear before thy presence, with hope of comfort, or almost
without despair of mercy, but y^ in the greatness or thy goodness, seeing
thee offer thy self unto me with all thy Graces, with a blushing fear, I
fall at the feet of thy mercy, beeseeching thee, so to bless me with thy
grace, that my wickedness may not destroy, that which thy goodness has
builded: Oh dear LORD, thy servant ANNA, putting of the world and putting on
thee, shaking of all vanities, and clothing her self with thy comfort, leaving
the world, beetooke her self to thy Temple, where continuing many years in
fasting and prayer, she received at last the ioyefull fruict of her hope, in
the gracious beeholding of thy Glorious coming: but, oh Lord, woe is me, that
have so long looked after the world, that I have so little looked after thee,
that I have rather lost my self in a wilderness, then once set a step into
thy Temple: I have feasted my flesh with the pleasures of the world, and almost
famished my soul with the lack of thy holy word, and have been rather lost
many years in vanity, then employed almost any hour in devout prayer, as one
rather fearing thy wrath, then wishing thy presence: but, sweet Lord, thou art
the God of Eternity, who having all time at thy commandment, do appoint
every hour at thy pleasure, to call thy servants, unto mercy, and to comfort
them in thy blessing; to thee therefore my dear Lord, though long first, yet
at last, and I hope never to late, on the knees of my heart with the tears of
my love I come unto thy mercy, beseeching thee most humbly, in the spirit of
thy grace, so to instruct me to pray, and continue me in prayer unto the
presence of thy pity, that putting of the delights of the vanity of this
world, I may put on the joy of the virtue of thy love, beetaking my self to
the Temple of thy Truth, and only long in my soul to beehold the blessing of
thy coming: come I say, sweet Jesus, come down into my heart, heal my wounded
soul, quiet my troubled spirit, deliver me from this sinful prison, lighten
my darckned eyes, take me out of this deadly sorrow into the joy of thy
eternal mercy, where feeding on the fruict of my faith in the favor of thy
grace, at the feet of thy presence, I may see the paradise of my soul: and in
a new song of thanckes giving, I may glorify thy holy name:

Amen.
A prayer upon the queen of sheba her coming to Solomon: The fruict thereof:
The treasure of true wisdom which is only in the word of GOD.
O Infinitte and eternal God, the ground of all virtue, and giver of all
goodness, the fountayn of unsearchable deep wisdom of the incomprehensyble
Deity; look, I humblye beeseech thee upon the simple soul of thy silly
creature: The Queen of Sheba came to thy servant Solomon, to here the wonder
of his wit, which compared to thy wisdom, is as nothing, and shall not I come
to thee for the knowledge of my co^sort? yes my dear LORD, let thy mercy be my
tutor, thy wisdom, my lesson, thy comfort, my life: Teach me ever how to pray,
what to hope for in my prayer, and how to be thanckfull or thy blessings:
teach me wisdom to know thee, knowledge to serve thee, and Grace so to love
thee, that I may never live to leave thee: be thou the co^templatio^ of my
study, the letters of my reading, and the word of my continual remembrance;
the note of my Comfort the white of my love, and ^he light of my life: Inspire
my heart with thy holy spirit, lead me in the way of thy truth, and bless me
with the joy of thy peace: that leaving this desert, where fools loose their
wits, among the followers of thy will, I may here the wonders of thy
wisdom: where the says of the s^mple, find the sum of their felycity: that
being pardoned my faults, and healed of my folly, in the service of my faith I
may glorify thy holy Majesty: but oh Lord she brought gifts of great value,
which she presented unto thy servant, and I have nothing to give thee but my
self, unworthy present for thy presence: but sweet Lord, I beeseech thee
refuse not thy servant, though unworthy thy favor, and instruct me in thy law,
though unworthy thy love, that having thy lesson in my heart, I may teach thy
will unto the world: grant this oh dear God, for thy dear beloved Son JESUS
CHRIST his only sake, to whom with thee, and the holy Ghost, three persons,
but one GOD, be all Honor, and Glory, humbly ascribed of me, and all thy
poor unworthy servants, in all things, for all things, and above all things,
world without end:

Amen.
A prayer upon the words of Peter unto Christ in the time of his
transfiguration. Luke ix. verse 33. The fruict thereof: the joy of the faithful.
O How amiable are thy dwellings my deer Lord Jesus, how pleasant are thy
graces? and how comfortable are thy mercies? more sweet are they to my heart,
then honey unto my mouth, yea sweeter then honey and the honey comb: when thy
holy Apostle Peter beeheld thee transfigured, being ravished in soul with the
sweet of thy countenance, then could he say, here is good being LORD: so my
sweet savior, when in my soul I behold but one beam of thy bright love, I
can say to my self, it is good being with thee LORD: for better is it, not to
be at all, then to be without the comfort of thy blessing: bless me therefore
sweet IESV, I beeseech thee with the feeling of thy goodness, the comfort of thy
mercy, and the joy of thy love: and let me say, to my self, whiles I am in
this body of sin, in this wretched world, here is ill being LORD, where I am
so much without thee, and, only their is good being where I might never be
from thee, that being ravished with the sweetness of thy brightness, I might make
my poor soul, a tabernacle for thy dwelling, that being cleansed from my
sin, by the only merit of thy mercy, and sweeted in my soul, by the oil
of thy grace, in the fruicts, of thancks giueing, I may Glorifye thy holly name:

Amen.
A prayer upon Mary Magdalens weeping at the Sepulcher: John xvi: The fruict
thereof: the virtue of constancy, in the love of the faithful.
KNock say thou sweet Jesus, and it shall be opened unto us, seek and we
shall find, ask and we shall have: oh my deer God long have I sought thee,
with the zealous love of my heart, knocking at the gates of thy grace, with the
sighs of unfeigned sorrow, and beging with bitter tears, but one drop of thy
mercy: but my dear God sin did so blind me, that I went still out of the
way, that does lead me to thy will, sin did so oppress me, I could not come
at thy grace; yea, sin did so dismaie me, that I was afraid of thy mercy:
but now sweet Lord being cleared of my blindness, by the light of thy holy word,
and seeing the gates of thy grace open to the passage of the Repentaunt among
the hopes of the faithful, I beg an alms of thy mecry: I reed oh Lord of Mary
Magdalens great grace, who being a great sinner yet by a great repentance,
received a great measure of thy mercy: in sorrow she sought thee, in humility
she loved thee, and in love she found thee: yea, alive she loved thee, dead,
she mourned for thee, buried she sought thee: and risen she found thee:
sweetly was she blessed, that having once beegon to seek thee could never
leave till she found thee, and having once found thee, did so dearly love thee
that in the depth of her love, she had no joy to live from thee: sweet Jesus,
so give me grace to seek thee, that in thy grace, I may find thee, by thy
grace I may love thee, and, in thy gracious love, I may live to beehold thee:
open mine ears, that I may hear thee call: and open mine eyes, that I may see
thy goodness: open my heart, that I may with tears attend thee, and open thy
hands, to take me wholly unto thee: mortify my flesh, that my soul may live,
shut me not from the gates of thy grace, but keep me under the shadow of thy
wings: lead me through the darkness of sin, into the day light of thy love;
the first day in the week and early in the morning let me seek thee, let
the prime of my youth and the whole time of my pilgrimage, be only employed
to the finding out of thy favor: let me fear nothing while thou art my hope,
nor be satisfied with any thing till I be filled with thy love: let me weep
at thy grave, that I may joy in thy grace; and so mourn for thy absence, that
I may rejoice in thy presence: let me not depart with thy disciples, but abide
with thine angels, till, in the pity of my sorrow, thou will show me thy
self: when, hearing from thee, but Mary, I may answer, but master, wherein my
soul ravished with thy love may deuote the service of my life: but, oh Lord,
how should I most woeful, wretched, and wicked creature, liueing in this vale
of sorrow and misery, come to the comfortable hope to clime the hill of thy
mercy? a polluted vessel of the earth, to behold the pure and bright Glory of
the heavens? but oh LORD, do I ask thee how? and have thy holy word so clear
a lantern to my love; forgive my sweet Christ, my forgetfulness of thy care,
and give me grace to remember the rules of my comfort: wherein I find after
storms fair weather is sweetest, after troubles, peace is most comfortable,
and after death, life is most joy full; sweet Jesus therefore that have
mortified me with the storms of this world, comfort me with the Sun shine
of thy Grace, after the troublesome temptations, of evil spirits, give me
peace in thy holy spirit, and after the death of this my carnal Absence, give
my soul life in the beeholding of thy presence: give me patience to seek
thee in thy passion, that I may rejoice to see thy Resurrection: and that in
the Merit of thy mercy, receiving the Comfort of my salvation, I may with the
tears of my heart witness the love of my soul, not desiring to live, but to
Glorify thy holy name:

Amen.
A prayer upon Magnificate, not applying the history: The fruict thereof: The
joy of the soul that is ravished with the love of CHRIST.
ESscence of eternity, in ye holy Majesty of the Trinall unity, in the heavenly
DEITY, light of the Heavens, day of the world, beawty of virtue, and Glory of
wisdom, sweet IESV, the true and only beegotten and beeloued son, of the
true, and only incomprehensible, everliving, and euerlouing GOD: my Creator in
thy power, my Redeemer in thy merit, my Sanctifier in thy love, and my Savior
in thy mercy; how shall I, clodde of claye, slime of the earth, dust and Ashes,
wretched worm, and wicked creature, presume to the happiness, to have a
thought of such holiness, as to aspire, so high a blessing, as to touch the
smallest tittle, of the due title of thy glory: yet, sweet IESV, seeing that ye
dead Earth in her Fruictes does praise thee, shall my soul live, and in no
service honor thee? and since the living do adore thee, shall I dye, and not
praise thee? God forbid: but, alas, shall darcknesse speak of light, Error of
truth, baseness of Glory, or a sinner, of God? when the Earth quakes, the Sea
Roares, the Heavens shake, and the Aungells tremble at thy presence, and yet I
see the Elements give their natures: The Sun his heat, the water her
coolness, the Air her moisture, and the Earth her dryness; The trees their
fruicts, the flowers their sweets, the Sea her fishes, the Earth her gemmes,
the Air her comfort, the Fire her light, and the world her wealth in the
service of her Creatures in obedience to thy holy will, to Glorify thy holy
name; and shall I of all the world most bound to thee in the whole world, that
have tasted so much of thy goodness, so much forget thy Greatness, as, in no
work of thy Grace, to humble my soul to thy Glory? God forbid: no, my sweet
God, I humbly beeseech thee give me the patience of thy saints, the faith of
thy Martiers, the joy of thine Angels, and the wisdom of thy holy Spirit,
that I may suffer all things for thy love, I may die in thy service, and so
sing of thy goodness, that in ringing out thy praises, the heuens may rejoice
to here thy glory in the world: oh my sweet CHRIST, help me to honor thee:
Inspire my heart with thy Love, tell me what to think of thee, teach me
what I shall say of thee, learn me how I shall pray unto thee; that in my
Soul, I may never cease to praise thee: O glory in the highest heavens,
highest glory of the heavens, only glory before the heavens, be thou
glorified above the heuens: oh that my hrat could dissolve into tears, to wash
the feet of thy favor, or that my soul in sighs, could ascend a Sacrifice
to thy mercy, that in Soul and body, I might show some service of my love,
which am worse then nothing, till I be something in thee: but thou have made
me, as it has pleased thee, and can make me what it pleases thee, let it
therefore please thee, I beeseech thee, to make me only to please thee: I am
a creature of thy will, work me only to thy will: draw me to thee, by thy
holy spirit, hold me to thee, by thy holy Love, and inspire me with thy holy
wisdom, that loathing the world with the vanities thereof, in thy only
mercy, I may see the paradise of my soul: that having with patience passed my
purgatory in this life, and in the merit of thy mercy, receiving the comfort of
my Salvation, where the Angels of thy love, do sing in Glory of thy grace, my
poor humble Soul may sing Amen to their Music.

Gloria in excelcis Deo.
