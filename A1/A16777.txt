THE PASSIONS of the SPIRIT.

LONDON Printed by Thomas Este, dwelling in Aldersgate-streete. 1599.

TO THE WORSHIPFVL and virtuous gentlewoman, Mris MARY HOVGHTON, wife to the
worshipful Mr Peter Houghton Esquire, Alderman, and now one of the shrifes of
London. 1594.
IT is the general received opinion among most men that nothing is more odious
in the sight of god and good men, than unthankfulness. And in deed, the trees
and plants, and the earth it self, which for the rain and labor that is
beestowed upon them, yield forth fruit, show themselves thankful. And
therefore I was so bold, (right Worshipful) having received many favors at
your hands, that I might not seem to have received them in vain by
vnthanfulnesse, to offer unto your worships hands this little present Greater
men may easily offer greater gifts. But if gifts may find acceptance according
to the good hearts and minds of the giver, I fear not but this little gift,
though small in view, shall be graciously accepted? both because the matter is
precious, and it proceeds from a mind as willing to show it thankful, as
whosoever else that commends him self by a greater present. And so wishing unto
your worshipful husband and your self, all hearts content in this life, and
everlasting happiness in the life to come, humbly take my leave.

Your worships at command, Thomas Este.

The passions of the spirit
Where shall I find
that most morneful muse,
That never heard
of any thing but moan,
And read the passion
that her pen does use,
When she and sorrow
sadly sits alone,
To tell the world
more then the world can tell
What fits in deed
most fitly figure hell?
Let me not think
once of the smallest thought,
Nor speak of less
then of the greatest grief,
Where every sense
with sorrows over wrought,
Lives but in death
despairing of relief,
While thus the heart
with torments torn asonder,
May of the world
be called the woeful wonder.
The day like nights,
all darckned by distress,
Pleasure beecome
a subject full of pain,
The spirit ouerprest
with heaviness,
While helpless horror
vexes every vain:
Death shakes his dart,
grief has my grave prepared:
Yet to more sorrow,
is my spirit spared.
The Owly eyes
that not endure the light,
The night ravens song
that sounds of naught but death,
The Cockatrice
that kills with her sight,
The poisoned air
that chokes the sweetest breath,
Thunder and earthquakes
all together met,
These tell a little
how my life is set.
Where words desolu'd
to sighs, sighs into tears,
And every tear
to torments of the mind,
The minds distress,
into those deadly fears,
That find more death
then death it self can find.
Death to that life,
that living does descrie,
A little more
yet of my misery.
Put all the woes
of all the world together:
Sorrow and death,
sit down in all their pride,
Let misery bring
all her muses hither,
With all the horror
that the heart can bide.
Then read the state
but of my ruthful story,
And say my grief
has gotten sorrows glory.
For natures sickness
sometime may have ease,
Fortune (though fickle)
sometime is a friend,
The minds affliction
patience may appease,
And death is cause
that many torments end:
But ever sick, crossed,
grieved, and living dying,
Think on the spirit
in this sorrow lying.
To show the nature
of my pain (alas,)
Pain has no nature
to descrie my pain,
But where that pain
it self in pain does pass.
Think on vexation
so in every vain,
That hopeless, helpless,
endless pains may tell,
Save hell it self,
but mine there is no hell.
If sickness be a grownd
of deadly grief,
Consuming cares
have caught me by the heart:
If want of comfort,
hopeless of relief,
Be further woe
to way my inward smart:
If friends unkindness,
so my grief is grounded:
If causeless wronged,
so my heart is wounded.
If love refused
so read on my ruin,
If truth disgraced,
so my sorrow moved,
If faith abused
the ground my torments grue in,
If virtue skorned
so my death approved,
If death delaying,
so my heart perplexed,
If living dying,
so my spirit vexed:
My infants years
misspent in childish toys,
My riper age
in rules of little reason,
My better years
in all mistaken joys,
My present time
(Oh most unhappy season,)
In fruitless labors
and in ruthlesse love,
O what a horror
has my heart to prove!
I sigh to see
mine infancy misspent,
I mourn to find
my youthful life misled,
I weep to feel
my further discontent,
I dye to try,
my love is living dead,
I sigh, I mourn,
I weep, I living dye,
And yet must live
to show more misery.
The hunted Heart
sometime does leave the hound:
My heart (alas)
is never out of chase.
The lime-hounds lease
sometimes is yet unbound:
My hands are hopeless
of so high a grace.
Summer restores
what winter does deprive:
But my heart withered
never can revive.
I can not figure
sorrow in conceit,
Sorrow exceedes
all figures of her sense:
But on my woe
when sorrows all may wait,
To see a note
exceed their excellence,
Let me conclude
to see how I am wounded,
Sorrow her self
is in her self confounded.
But whereof grows
the passion of this pain,
That thus perplexeth
every inward part?
Whence is the humor
of this hateful vain,
So damps the spirit,
and consumes the heart?
Oh let my soul
with bitter tears confess,
It is the ground
of all unhappiness.
If lack of wealth,
I am the note of need:
If lack of friends,
no faith on earth remains:
If lack of health,
see how my heart it bleeds:
If lack of pleasure,
look upon my pains:
If lack of wealth,
of friends, of health or pleasure,
Say then my sorrows
must be out of measure.
Measure? no measure
measure can my thought,
But that one thought
that is beyond all measure:
Which knowing how
my sorrows have been wrought,
Can bring my heart
into her highest pleasure,
Which either must
my sorrows cut of quight,
Or never let me think
upon delight.
There is a lack
that tells me of a life,
There is a loss
that tells me of a love:
Beetweene them both
a state of such a strife,
As makes my spirit
such a passion prove:
That lack of the one
and thothers loss (Alas)
Makes me the wofullst wretch
that ever was.
My dearest love
that dearest bought my love,
My only life
by whom I only live.
Was ever faith
did such affection prove?
Or ever grace
did such a glory give?
But such a lack
and such a loss aye me,
Must needs the sorrow
of all sorrows be.
My love is fayer
and fayrer then the sun,
Which has his light
but from his fairest love,
Oh fairest love
whose light is never done,
and fairest light
does such a love approve.
But such love lost
and such a life obscured,
Can there a greater
sorrow be endured?
He came from high
to live with me beelow:
He gave me life
and showed me greatest love.
Unworthy I,
so high a worth to know,
Left my chief bless
a baser choice to prove.
I saw his wonders,
yet did I not beeleeue him,
And for his goodness,
with my sins did grieve him.
I saw him faultlesse,
yet I did offend him:
I saw him wronged
and yet did not excuse him:
I saw his foes,
yet sought not to defend him:
I had his blessings,
yet I did abuse him.
But was it mine
or any others deed?
Whose ere it was
it makes my heart to bleed.
To see the feet
that traueld for our good,
To see the hands
that brake the lively bread,
To see the head
whereon our honor stood,
To see the fruit
where on our spirits fed:
These feet, hands bored,
and his head all bleeding,
Who does not dye
with such a sorrow reading?
He plaest all rest.
yet had no resting place:
He healed each pain,
yet liud in sore distress:
Deserud all good,
yet driven to great disgrace:
Gave all hearts joy,
himself in heaviness:
Suffered them live,
by whom himself was slain:
Lord who can live*
to see such love again?
A Virgins child,
by virtuous power conceived,
A harmless man,
that lived for all men's good,
A faithful friend
that never faith deceived,
A heavenly fruit
for heart especial food,
A spirit all
of excellence divine,
Such is the essence
of this love of mine.
Whose Mansion, heaven,
yet lay within a manger:
Who gave all food,
yet sucked a virgins breast:
Who could have killed,
yet fled a threatened danger.
who sought our quiet
by his own unrest:
who dyed for them,
which highly did offend him,
And lives for them
which can not comprehend him.
Who came no further
then his father sent him,
Who did fulfill
but what he did command him,
Who praid for them
that proudly did torment him,
For telling truth
to what they did demand him,
Who did all good
that humbly did entreat him,
And bare their blows
that did unkindly beat him.
A sweet physician
for the body crased,
A heavenly medison
for the mind diseased,
A present comfort
for the wits amassed,
A joyful spirit
for the soul displeased.
The body, mind,
wit and spirits joy,
What is the world
without him but annoy?
He knew the sickness
that our souls infected,
And that his blood
must only be our cure,
When so our faith
his sacred love affected,
that for our lives
he would a death endure,
He knew his passion,
yet his patience bare it:
Oh how my soul
does sorrow to declare it!
He heald the sick,
gave sight unto the blind,
Speech to the dum,
and made the lame to go:
Unto his love
he never was unkind,
He loved his friend
and he forgave his foe.
And last his death
for our love not refused,
What soul could live
to see such love misused?
To note his words
what wisdom they contain,
To note his wisdom
of all worth the wonder,
To note his works
what glory they do gain,
To note his worth,
world, heaven, and earth, come under.
To note the glory
that his Angels give him,
Fie that the world
to such disgrace should drive him.
Unseen he came,
he might be seen unto us:
Unwelcome seemd,
that came for all our wealth
He came to die,
that he might comfort do us,
We slew the subject
of our spirts health.
The subject? no,
the king of all our glory:
VVeep heart to death,
to tell this doleful story.
A Lion, where his force
should be affected,
And yet a Lamb
in mildness of his love:
As true as Turtle,
to his love elected.
Sure as mount Sion
that can never move.
So mild a strength,
and so fast truth to prove,
What soul can live,
and lack so sweet a love?
He preached, he praid,
he fasted, and he wept,
The sweet creator
for his sinful creature:
The careful watch
full warely he kept,
That brake the neck
even of their foulest nature.
And when he did
to happy state restore us,
Shall we not weep
that he may not abhor us*
To hate a love
must argue loathsome nature,
To wrong a friend
must prove too foul a deed,
To kill thy self
will show a curssed creature,
To slay the soul
no more damnation need.
Then, spoil the fruit
whereon the spirit feeds,
O what a hell
within the soul it breeds!
He thought no ill
but only did all good,
He gave all right
and yet all wrong received.
The fiends temptation,
strongly he withstood,
Yet let himself
by sinners be deceived.
And see at last
when he was woe-be-gone him,
The traytorous world
did tyranize upon him.
His faultlesse members
nailed on the cross,
His holy head
was crowned all with thorns,
His garments given
by lots to gain our loss,
His power derided
all with scoffs and skornes,
His body wounded
and his spirit vexed:
To think on this,
what soul is not perplexed?
Poor Peter wept
when he his name denied,
And Mary Magdalen
wept for her offense:
His mother wept
when she his death espied,
But yet no tears
could stand for his defense.
But if these wept
to see his woeful case:
Why die not I
to think of his disgrace?
Happy was he
that suffered death so ny him:
That at his end
repentance might behold him:
Twice happy life
that did in love so try him,
As to his faith
such favor did vnsould him,
As craving comfort
but in mercies eyes,
That self same day
did live in Paradise.
Would I had been
ordaind to such a death,
To die with him,
to live with him for ever,
And from the air,
but of this blessed breath,
To suck the life,
whose love might fail me never,
And drinck of that sweet spring
that never wastes,
And feed of that life's bread
that ever lasts.
Oh would my soul
were made a sen of tears,
Mine eyes might wake,
and never more be sleeping*
My heart may bear
the pains all pleasure wears,
So I might see him once
yet in my weeping.
When joyful voice
this song might never cease,
My Saviors sight
has set my soul in peace.
Should I esteem
of any worldly toy,
That might beehould
the height of such a treasure?
Could I be Judas
to my chiefest joy,
To gain possession
of a graceless pleasure?
No: could my soul
in comfort once conceive him,
I hope his mercy
would not let me leave him.
Blessed was the fish
that but the figure swallowed
Of my sweet Jesus
but in Jonas name:
More blessed tomb
by that sweet body hallowed,
From whence the ground
of all our glory came?
Might not my soul
be sooner in a wish,
Would I were such a tomb
or such a fish.
But Jonas left the sea
and came to land,
And Jesus from the earth
to heaven ascended:
Why should I then
upon more wishes stand,
But cry for mercy
where I have offended?
And say my soul
unworthy is the place,
Ever to see
my Savior in the face.
Yet let me not despair
of my desire,
Although even hell
do answer my desert.
Where humble hope,
that pity does aspire:
Proves penitencie,
the pacyfiing part.
Where mercy sweet,
that sees my souls behavior,
May grant me grace,
to see and serve my Savior.
Whom till I see,
in sorrows endless anguish,
All discontent
with all that I can see,
Resolud in soul
in sorrows lake to languish,
where no conceit
but discontent may be,
I will sit down
till after this worlds hell,
My saviors sight
may only make me well.
Canto. 2.
But shall I so
my secret grief give over,
With hope to see
the glory of my sight?
Or can my soul
her sacred health recover,
While no desert
does look upon delight?
No, no: my heart
is too too full of grief,
For ever thinking
to receive relief.
The Sun is down
the glory of the day,
The spring is past,
the sweetness of the year,
The harvest in,
whereon my hope did stay,
And withering winter
gives but chilling cheer,
And what such death
Can grief, or sorrow give,
As see his death
whereby the soul does live?
Me thinks I see,
and seeing sigh to see,
How in his passion
patience plays her part:
And in his death
what life he gives to me,
In my loves sorrow
to relieve my heart.
But what a care
does this conclusion try,
The head must off,
or else the body die?
He was my head,
my hope, my heart, my health,
The special Jewel
of my spirits joy,
The trusty treasure
of my highest wealth,
The only pleasure
kept me from annoy:
He was, and is,
and evermore shall be,
In life or death,
the life of life to me.
And let me see
how sweetly yet he looks
Even while the tears
are trickling down his face:
And for my life
how well his death he brooks,
While my desert
was cause of his disgrace.
And let me wish
yet while his death I see,
I could have died
for him that died for me.
Had I but seen
him as his servants did,
At sea, at land,
in city, and in field,
Though in him self
he had the glory hyd,
That in his grace
the height of glory hild:
Then might my sorrow
somewhat be appeased,
That once my soul
had in his sight been pleased.
But not to see him
till I see him die,
And that my deed
was causer of his death,
How can I cease
to weep, to houle, and cry,
To see the gasping
of that glorious breath,
That purest love
unto the soul approved,
And is the blessing
of the soul beeloued?
Shall I not wash
his body with my tears,
And save the blood
that issues from his side,
That keeps my heart
from all infernal fears,
Unto my soul
by my firm faith applied?
Shall I not strive
with Joseph for the course,
And make his tomb
in my souls true remorse?
Shall I not curse
those hateful hellish fiends,
That led the world
to work such wickedness?
And hate all them
that have not been his friends,
But follow on
that work of wretchedness?
Cut off the head
that first hands on him laid,
And help to hang
the dog that him betrayed.
Am I not one
of that unhappy brood,
The Pelican
does figure in her nest,
When I must live
but by his only blood,
In whose sweet love
my life does only rest?
O wretched bird!
but I more wretched creature,
To figure such a bird
in such a nature.
Did God himself
ordain it should be so,
To save my life
my Savior so should die?
His will be done:
yet let me weep for woe,
To be the subject
of his misery.
That though he came
to mend that was amiss,
He should be so
the author of my bliss.
Shall I not drive
the watchman from the grave,
And watch the rising
of the son renowned?
Or go my self
a live into the grave,
To kiss the body
where it lies intombed?
What shall I do?
or what shall I approve,
For my souls health
that so my soul did love?
Oh. Love the ground
of love, Oh lively love,
Why do I live
that did not die with thee,
When in my heart
I do such horror prove,
As lets my care
no thought of comfort see,
How my poor soul
might once such service do thee,
To give me hope
how I am come unto thee?
No: I have run
The way of wickedness,
Forgetting that
my faith should follow most:
I did not think
upon thy holiness,
Nor by my sin
what sweetness I have lost,
Oh sin! so sin
has compast me about,
That (Lord) I know not
where to find thee out.
If in the heaven,
it is too high a place,
For wicked heart
to hope to clime so high:
If in the world,
the earth is all to base
To entertain
thy glorious majesty:
If in the world,
unworthy I to read
So sweet a sense
to stand my soul in stead:
If in my heart,
sin says thou art not there:
If in my soul,
it is too foul infected:
If in my hope,
it is too full of fear,
And fearful love
has never faith elected.
In soul, nor body,
hope, nor sear, (aye me)
Where should I seek
where my souls love may be?
Alas the day
that ever I was borne,
To see how sin
has bard me from my bliss,
And that my soul
is so in torments torn,
To know my love
and come not where he is.
Yet, if that ever heavens
heard creatures cry,
Lord, look a little
on my misery.
Let mercy plead
in true repentance cause,
Where humble prayer,
may heavenly pity move:
That though my life
have broken sacred laws,
My hearts contrition
yet may comfort prove:
That till my soul
may my sweet Savior see,
Mercy may cast
one loueing look on me.
And while I sit
with Mary at the grave,
As full of grief
as ever love may live,
My wounded heart
some spark of hope may have,
Of such relief
as glorious hand may give:
To make me seele
though sin has death deserved,
In mercies love
is my souls life preserved.
Which sacred truth
until my soul does taste,
To slake the sorrow
of this heart of mine,
My weary life
in woeful thoughts must wast,
While soul and body
humbly I resine,
Unto those glorious
holy hands of his,
Who is the hope
of my eternal bliss.
Canto. 3.
But can I leave
to think upon the thing,
That I can never
put out of my thought?
Or can I cease
of his sweet love to sing,
Who by his blood
his creatures comfort brought?
Or can I live
to thinck that he should die,
In whom the hope
of all my life does lie?
No* Let me thinck
upon his life and death,
And after death,
his ever life again.
He breathed our life,
and giueing up his breath,
Reuiude our souls,
that in our sins were slain.
His life so good,
as never death deserved,
And by his death,
our ever lives preserved.
Did he not wash
his poor Apostles feet?
Came he not riding
on a silly Ass?
Did he not heal
the criples in the street,
And fed a world
where little victual was?
Did not his love
most true affection try,
To die for us
that we might never die?
Was never infant
showed such humbleness:
Was never man
did speak as this man did:
Was never lover
showed such faithfulness:
Was never true man
such a torter bid:
Was never state
contained such a story:
Was never Angel
worthy such a glory.
O glorious glory,
all in glory glorius!
Angels rejoiced
at his incarnation.
O power-full virtue,
of all power victorius
The true redemption
of his best creation!
O glorious life
that made the devils wonder,
And glorious death
that trod the devils under!
Thus in his birth,
his life, and death, all glory
He did receive:
who was himself the same,
The stately substance
of that sacred story,
From whence the ground
of highest glory came.
When highest power,
to highest glory raised,
And all the host
of heaven with glory praised.
Was ever such
ingratitude approved,
Since heaven and earth
for man, and man was made
For only God,
who hild him his beloved,
Till graceless sin
did make his glory fade:
That he, whom Angels
with such reverence used,
Should be by men
refused and abused?
O lively Image
of the fathers love!
O lovely Image
of the fathers life!
O pure conceit
that does this concord prove,
That all agreement
breeds no thought of strife!
But that the Son
in state of all the story,
Is found the brightness
of the Fathers glory.
Could ever such
a glory be refused,
By those that were
in duty to adore it?
Or could so great
a glory be refused,
When Angels tremble,
when they stand before it?
O man, woman,
to wound thy soul so sore,
To loose the glory
so for euer-more!
Behold the heavens
what sorrow they did show,
And how the earth
her dolor did discrie.
The Sun was darck,
and in the earth be low,
The buried bodies
showed their agony.
The temple rent,
the heavens with anger moved,
To see the death
of the divine beeloued.
And yet thou man
full little do regard
What thou had done
unto thy dearest love.
Thou made more reckning
of the worlds reward,
Then of the blessing
of thy souls be-houe.
But (wretched man)
descend into thy thought
And with this sorrow
wear thy self to naught.
Yet some there were,
too small a sum were they,
That ioyd to see the sum
of all their joy:
They watched the night,
and walked in the day,
And were not choked
with the worlds annoy:
But followed on
their heavenly love alone:
Would God in heaven
that I were such a one.
But aye me wretch,
all wretched as I am,
Unworthy all
to follow such a friend:
In sweet remembrance
of whose sweetest name,
The joys beegin
that never makes an end.
Let me but weep
and sorrow, till I see
How mercies love
will cast on look on me.
And let me hear
but what my Savior says,
He once did die
that I might ever live:
And that my soul
by her assured faith,
May feel the comfort
that his grace does give:
That for his love
who sorrows here so sore,
Shall joy in heaven,
and never sorrow more.
Canto. 4.
OH joy above all joys.
that ever were!
Could I conceive
but half thine excellence,
Or how to hope
to give attendance there,
Where thou do keep
thy royal residence,
And on my knees
thy holy name adore:
Were my soul well,
she should desire no more:
To see the day
that from an high is springing,
To guide our feet
into the way of peace,
To hear the Virgins
playing, Angels singing,
The Psalms of glory
that shall never cease.
To hear the sound
of such a heavenly queare,
Would it not joy
the soul to see and hear?
To see the Saints
and Martyrs in their places,
By highest grace
with heavenly glory crowned:
To see the kysses.
and the sweet embrace
Of blessed souls,
by constant says renomed,
To see the ground
of all these sweet agreeing
Were not these sights
all sweetly worth the seeing?
The Diamond, Rubie,
Saphir, and such like
Of precious gemmes
that are the worldlings joys,
And greatest princes
for their crowns do seek,
To heavenly treasuers
are but trifling toys,
Wherewith the holy city
all is paued,
And all the walls
are round about in-graued:
Nor he that sits
on the supernall throne,
In majesty
most glorious to beehold,
And houlds the septer
of the world alone,
Has not his garment
of imbrodered gold:
But he is clothed
in truth and righteousness,
The heavenly garments
of true holiness.
Oh could my soul
out of some Angels wyng
By humble suit
obtain one only pen:
Might wright in honor
of my glorious king,
The joy of Angels
and the life of men.
That all the world
might fall upon their faces,
To hear the glory
of his heavenly graces.
But since I see
his wonder worth is such,
As does exceed,
the reach of humane sense,
And all the earth
unworthy is to touch
The smallest title
of his excellence:
Let me refer
unto some Angels glory
The happy writing
of this heavenly story.
Where this sweet King
that on the white horse rides,
Upon the wings
of the celestial wind,
Near whose sweet aier
no blasting breath abides,
Nor stands the tree,
that he does fruitless find,
Does make all tremble
where his glory goes,
Yea, where his mildness
most his mercy shows.
Where heavenly love
is cause of holy life,
And holy life increases
heavenly love:
Where peace established
without fear of strife,
Does prove the blessing
of the souls beehaue:
Where thirst, nor hunger,
grief, nor sorrow dwells,
But peace in joy,
And joy in peace excels.
Oh joyful fear
on virtuous love ^ll founded!
O virtuous love,
in mercies glory graced!
O gracious love,
on faith in mercy grounded!
Oh faithful love,
in heavenly favor placed!
Oh settled love,
that cannot be removed!
Oh glorious love,
of glory so beeloued!
Where virgins joy,
in their virginity,
The virtuous spouse
in undefiled bed,
And true deuines
in true deuinitie,
The gracious members
in their glorious head.
The sinners joy,
to escape damnation:
And faithful souls.
in their salvation.
Where sick men joy,
to see their sweetest health,
The prisoners joy
to see their liberty,
The poor rejoice
to see their sweetest wealth,
The virtuous
to adore the deity:
And I unworthy
most of all to see,
The eyes of mercy
cast one look on me.
Canto. 5.
BUT can my heart
thus leave her holy love,
Or seace to sing
of this her highest sweet?
Has Patience
no more passions left to prove?
Has phancie labored out
both hands and feet?
Or has Invention
straind her vain so sore,
That wit nor will
has power to write no more?
No, heavens forbid,
that ever faithful heart
Should have a weary thought
of doing well:
But that the soul
may summon every part
Of every sense,
where any thought may dwell,
That may discharge
the duty of this care,
To pen his praise,
that is without compare.
But since no eye
can look on him and live,
Nor heart can live,
but looking on his love:
Beehould the glory,
that his grace does give,
In all his works
that does such wonders prove.
Than all the world
may find their wits to weak,
But of the smallest
of his praise to speak.
Behold the earth
how sweetly she brings forth
Her trees, her flowers,
her herbs, and every grass
Of sundry natures,
of most secret worth:
And how each branch
does others beauty pass:
Both beasts, and birds,
with fishes, worms, and flies,
How each their high creator
glorifies.
The Lions strength
does make him stand as king:
The Unicorn
does kill the poisons power:
The roaring Bull
does make the woods to ring:
The Tiger does
the cruel wolf deuouer:
The Elephant,
the weighty burden bears,
And ravening Wolves,
are good yet for their heirs.
To see the Gray-hound course
the Heart in chase,
While little Dormouse
sleeps out her time.
The Lambs and Rabits
sweetly run at base,
Whilst highest trees
the little Squirell clime.
The crauling Worms
out creeping in the showers,
And how the Snayle
do clyme the lofty towers.
To see the Whale
make furrows in the seas,
While suddenly
the Dolphin strikes her dead:
Which having found
the depth of his disease,
Upon the shore
does make his dying bed.
Where heavens thus work
for weaker hearts beehoue,
Does not this grace,
a work of glory prove?
But since that all,
Sky, Earth, or Sea contains,
Was made for man,
and man was only made
For only God,
who only glory gains,
And that one glory
that can never fade:
Shall man forget
to give all glory due,
Unto his God
from whom all glory grew?
But let me come
a little higher yet,
To Sun and Moon
and every Star of light:
To see how each
do in this order sit,
Where every one
does keep his course aright:
And all to guide
these darkened eyes of ours,
Give these not glory
to the higher powers?
No, let not man
show himself so ungrateful,
Unto his God,
that all in love did make him,
By thancklesse thoughts
to make his spirit hateful,
Unto his king
that never will forsake him.
But let his soul
to God all glory give,
In whom, does all love,
life, and glory live.
And let me wretch,
(unworthy most of all
To lift mine eyes
unto his lovely seat,)
Before the feet
but of his mercy fall,
And of his mercy
but the leave entreat:
That with his servants
I may sit, and sing
An ALLELVIAH
to my heavenly King.
Canto. 6.
COme all the world,
and call your wits together,
Borrow some pens,
out of the Angels wings:
Entreat the heavens
to send their Muses hither
To help, your souls
to write of sacred things.
Profane conceits,
must all be cast away:
The night is past,
and you must take the day.
Speak not of sin,
it bears no part here:
But write of grace
and whence her glory grue:
Think of the love,
that to the life is dear,
And, of the life,
to whom all love is due.
And then sit down
in glory all to sing,
All to the glory
of our glorious King.
First, make your grounds
of faithful holiness:
Then, your deuisions
of divine desires:
Let all your rests
be hopes of happiness,
Which mercies Music
in the soul requires:
Let all your sharps
be fears of faithful hearts,
And all your flats
the death of your deserts.
Yet rise and fall,
as hope and fear directs,
The nature of each note,
in space or line:
And let your voices
carry such effects,
As may approve
your passions are divine.
Then let your consorts
all in one agree,
To God alone,
all only glory be.
Then let the dittie
be the dearest thought,
That may revive
the dying heart of love,
That only mercy
in the soul has wrought,
The happy comfort
of the heavens to prove.
Then let your sounds
unto the heavens ascend,
And all your closes,
all in glory end.
Glory to him,
that sits on the throne,
With all the host
of all the heavens attended:
Who all things made,
and gouernes all alone,
Vanquished his foes,
and all his flock defended,
And by his power
his chosen souls preserves:
So, sing his praise
that so all praise deserves.
And whilst all souls
are to their glory singing,
Let me poor wretch
not wholly hold my peace:
But, let my tears,
from mercy glory springing,
Keep time to that sweet song
may never seace.
That while my soul
does thus my God adore:
I may yet sing AMEN,
although no more.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Amen.
A Prayer.
O Heavenly God, o father dear
cast down thy tender eye:
Upon a wretch that prostrate here
before thy throne does lie.
O pour thy precious oil of grace
into my wounded heart,
O let the drops of mercy swage,
the rigor of my smart.
My fainted soul oppressed sore,
with careful clogge of sin:
In humble suit submits it self,
thy mercy Lord to win.
Grant mercy then O savior sweet
to me most woeful thrall:
whose morneful cry to thee o Lord
does still for mercy call.
Thy blessed will I have despised,
upon a stubborn mind:
And to the sway of worldly things
my self I have enclinde.
forgetting heaven and heavenly powers
where God and saints does dwell:
My life had like to tread the path,
that leads the way to hell.
But now my god and loadstar bright
I will no more do so:
To think upon my former life,
my heart does bleed for woe.
Alack I sigh, alack I sob,
alack I do repent:
That ever my licencious will,
so wickedly was bent.
Since now therefore with mournful plaints
that I thy mercy crave:
O Lord for thy great mercies sake,
let me thy mercy have.
Restore to life my wicked soul,
which else is like to die:
So shall my voice unto thy name,
sing praise eternally.
Now blessed be the Father first,
then blessed be the Son:
And blessed be the holy Ghost,
by whom all things are done.
Bless me O blessed Trinity,
with thy eternal grace:
That after death, my soul may have
in heaven a dwelling place.
FINIS.
A Prayer.
WIth heavy heart I call to thee,
O Lord give ear unto my plaint
In my distress consider me,
and mark how yt my soul does faint
Forlorn with care because that I,
so often offend thy majesty.
My due desert does breed despair
and hell I shall have for my hier,
Unless thou will thy wrath forbere:
to punish me in thy just ire.
But since thy mercy passes all,
For mercy Lord I cry and call.
And since thou paidst yt blodie prise,
the fathers wrath to pacify:
In thy great power and strength arise
forgive my sins O Lord I cry,
lest yt my soul be brought to naught
which once y have so dereli bought
Forgive thy people all their crime,
whose aid on thee does still depend
And with thy hand in this our time
Our noble Queen O lord defend:
And that she may her foes deface,
power upon her thy heavenly grace.
Amen.
FINIS.
