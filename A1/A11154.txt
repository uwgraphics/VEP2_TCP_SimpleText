To his entire and deare-esteemed friend, Master Thomas Hobbs. Health on earth
Temporal, and higher happiness eternal.
IT is but a toy (dear friend) that I present you with, but if you accept it
not, I shall lay the proverb to your charge, (qui parnum contemnit, indignus
est magno) he that refuses a little kindness, is unworthy of a greater, but
I question it not, nor would I have you over affect it for the title sake, for
that it is a Searcher of Money: perhaps you would have been willingly one of
this inquisition, but you shall not need, only ouer-view this, and take my
opinion, where he is, and that is, where I trust you shall never go to seek
him. I would define to you these two prepositions, of and in, that you are in
the world (though you must out of it) it is certain, but be not of the world,
(though you bear earth about ye,) for then you are a wordling, and have
affinity with Money, whose best part is but earth, whose (too much worshipped
greatness) in my judgment is but as a bare-legd passage through many acres of
briers, for a handful of rushes on the other side, (being found, not worth
half the toil) but use his company as I do, and that is as I wear my gloves
some-time on, some-time of, and many times leese them quite, take this, to
refuse it: the next search I make (God willing) shall be for wisdom, and then
if you will go along with me, we will pace together: till then, Farewell.

Yours, William Rowley.

To all those that lack money.
GEntlemen, for so much you may be that want money, and more they cannot be
that have it, (be that your comfort,) Ye are indeed the only Maecenasses
and Patrons of Poesy, for to your weak purses there are always joined
willing hearts, and (if not deeds) at the least, good words, (Similis simili
gaudet) I joy (most respected benefactors) in your fellowshippe, for from me
ye are like to receive nothing but good words, will ye now undertake an
equal travel with me (I know not yet whither) and let the destinies (if they
will) reward our pains. I know the walks in Paul's are stale to ye, ye
could tell extemporally I am sure how many paces it were between the quire and
the West door, or (like a Suffolk man) answer at the second question, dead
sure: there has been (many of ye) seen measuring the Longitude and Latitude
of More-fields any time this two years and upwards (all but in the hard season
of the great frost) and then ye slid away the time upon the Thames, ye have
been either eare-or-eye-witnesses or both to many mad voiages made of late
years, both by sea and land, as the travel to Rome with the return in
certain days, the wild mo^rise to Norrige, the fellows going back-ward to
Barwick, another hopping from York to London, and the transforming of the top
of Paul's into a stable, to these and many more, ad one more, what odds with
him now that will bring ye to the place where your lost and long wished friend
Mounsier Money is within two hours? me thinks ye smile now? but you would
laugh if it were so indeed, you think it not possible now, You having searched
so diligently and are yet without him, but pluck up a good heart, hire but this
hackney and ( vita pro vita) he will bring ye to the place for the prise of a
peck of oats, it is no great charge, along with him but pace him not too fast
for fear of stumbling, if ye dislike this voyage, return to my stable
again, if I horse ye not for better profit, turn from a Gentile to a Jew and
spit at me, there has been time and labor (a little of both) to bring him to
this small grows.

Vale. frustra nihil.

Your joint friend in estate. WILLIAM ROVVLEY.

A search for Money.
COme my masters, all you that will be of this privy search to find this
wandering Knight, ( Mounsieur Money) lay by your arms, and take your legs and
follow me. Stay, stay, stay, come not so fast: I call not all those that would
find him, (there would be left then scarce so many behind as there was
vndrown'd at the deluge) but some of those as are fittest and most at leisure
to search, as some score of idle soldiers, these are men that are experienced
to walk the round, for walk ye must resolve ere ye find him, he shifts his
lodging so often, or else he lies so obscure he will hardly be spoke with. Well, I
doubt not but ye will be painful in the quest, only your censures which way
first to begin as the likelyest to find the nearest way (being the very
Nominative case first to find the construction) and then have with ^ee: lets
first question his descent: faith from earth (of our o^rne kindred,) I would he
were not so near to us in kindred, then sure he would be nearer in kindness,
and then we must conclude (coming from earth) that thither he must return,
and therefore is now on earth. There may a doubt arise from hence too, for
being here can^nized, na^ Deified and made a God, (for therein we must needs
confess our impure idolatr^) it may be he has taken his glorious flight to
heaven already. That cannot be neither, sure Peter has bard the gates against
him, for he that would not sell heaven to Money on earth, it is most likely he
will not sell heaven, now once possessed of it, think ye then he hangs (like a
defected spirit) in the air, no he is too massy, or if he were, we have
Danaes enough to bring him showring down: in the fire think yee^ neither, I
know them that have run through fire and water too, and yet have not found
him: the sea is lunatique too, and mad folks keeps no money, he would sink
if he were there: is he damnd by the curses of the poor, and so gone to hell;
if he be, we will rake hell but we will find him, no, the Devil builds (they
say) to enlarge his kingdom, and builders commonly are without money, well,
then we must return to our first proposition, that he bides in his first
element, that's earth, conclude there to search for him then, set up the staff
which way to begin, and conuenimus omnes, it is fallen to the City, a hopeful
way a first: enter the gates before there be any opposition: have with ye.

Let us be careful in our inquisition, omit no (half suspected) place,
therefore let us enquire at the Tailors shop (for that stood next the gate) if
the beloved Mounsieur Money had not there taken up his lodging, the bravery of
the time makes a suspect, therefore enquire of him. The motion was no sooner
made to two or three crosse-legd journey men, but they swore by the bread they
then eat (and they seemd to relish their oaths with a good stomach too) that
there he was not, there he should have been indeed, and many bills of
authority they had sent forth to fetch him, but come he would not, nor could
they tell where he lay. Well on we go, the next inquiry we made at a painted
lattice, having (as we supposd) some hope there to find him, but alas, nihil
ad propositum as we found the sequel, we beldiv (and officers like) enterd
the house, where we spyed a more lamentable spectacle then Amyntas mourning
for his Phillis: An old woman (being the sick minded hostess) dejected and
thrown into such a perplexity, as you would have thought her own traitorous
^^^hes would have blown her up, her hand (like a despairing lover) boulstering
her cheek, yet with a saint intergatorie, she asked us what we lackt? we
told her Money, she something gathering her womanish spirits about her, told
us hastily, that she had paid her Brewer a month ago, and that we did her
wrong to demand it. But upon our further and well considerd replye, she was
satisfied, that we came about no such matter, only to know if such a traveler
lay in her house, then with a sorrowful shaking of her head, her grief was
redoubled, oh no, oh no, oh no, thrice as if she would have coniured him
thither presently, and began to plant her face for a most passionate reply. You
see this room here I have others well and thriftily furnished with
household stuff, but in this is containd my whole su^stance, which ere we go
any further you shall hear described. The battlements which had been whit^
and innocent, were now sullied with incapable caracters of (as I may so term
it) Candle-graphie, all the sides both walls and posts showed like a firmament
without a sun, all full of pale and sickly prodegies, which she with a heart
as cold as Aeneas recounting the tale of Troy, in this manner unfolded to us:
these longer sort (quoth the) which stood like white streamers, are the least
harmful portraiting (as it were) but even penny-worths of mishaps, these other
demi-lunes or half Moons, and with that she vented another volley of sighs
which are thrice double the mischief of the rest, but these round ones (quoth
she) like full Moons, (and indeed, not altogether ineffectual) for then it was
full sea, and the water stretched a little beyond her bounds, from forth the
hollow caves of her eyes issued fountains, which walking down the furrowed
paths of her face, and venteroustie meaning (as it were) to pass the gulf of
her mouth in quietness, bound her tongue for a cer^aine space to peace, which
afterward being releast, she went forward to tell us a strange Metamorphosis,
and one indeed that Ovid had quite forgotten, how that all her Ale was
transformed into those fatal meteors, which was indeed Chalk, 'twas strange,
but not so strange as true, Money says she was either sledde or a sleep, for
he was not stirring: she added with all the report of her better fortunes, how
she had a swifter and more profitable mutation of her Ale in former time, how
that first her Ale was Ale, and then it was Langtoe, and then it was Ale
again: we were presently (at the hearing of this) importunate, to have the
morrall of this mystery, what this Langtoe was? faith says she, the English
phrase is a little too broad, and comparisons are odious, else I would tell you
by the way of comparison, but (a little corrupting the word) she would tell us
by a simile, for even as the Salt-sea-water being taken out of the Sea, and
purged in the clouds and air, yet at length returns to sea again, and
becomes perfect Seawater again: so Ale though kept a while in the clouds of
the body, yet may again perfectly and prouidently return to the fat, and so
re-returne to the body, as ye may observe in the course of things, how grass
turns to hay, and the seeds of have make grass again. At this we were all
rewmatique, and spit at the apprehension of it, concluded and fold her
plainly, that we could not pity her, for we did imagine she had poisoned her
guests, and they in due revenge had chok't her, fed quid hoc ad nos: what is
this to our purpose? this is the general folly of the time, when we are once
got into an Alehouse, we never find the way out again: but on, on, what if
we inquired at the Shoomakers over the way? we did, but in vain, the master
himself was not within, and all the rest lay sick of Mercuries boon, (cruel
Mercury to deal so with good fellows,) yet they were laboring their hides,
and singing like careless travelers coram latrone: as we were but asking the
question steps me from over the way (ouerlistning us) a news-searcher, viz a
Barbar, he hoping to attains some discourse for his next patient left his
banner of basins swinging in the air; and closely eaue-drops our conference,
the saucie treble-tongu'd knave would insert somewhat of his knowledge,
(treble tongued I call him, and thus I prooue't, he has a reasonable Mother
tongue* h^s Barber-surgions tongue, and a tongue between two of his fingers,
and from thence proceeds his wit, and it is a snapping wit too,) well sir, he
(before he was asked the question) told us, that the wandering knight sure was
not far off, for on Saterday-night he was feign to watch till morning, to
trim some of his followers, and its morning they went away from him betimes:
he swore he never clos^d his eyes till he came to Church, and then he slept
all Sermon time, but certainly he is not far before, and at yonder Lauerne
(showing us the bush) I do imagine he has taken a chamber, we went somewhat
hopeful now, having so fair a likelihood: Thither we came, where at the
entry we ^care a confused noise (like a black Sanctus, or a house haunted
with spirits, such hollowing, shouting, dancing and clinking of pots, that
sure now we supposed we had found, for all th's reuelling could not be without
Mounsieur Money had been on of ^he crew, we had the salute (of welcome
gentlemen) presently, wilt please ye see a chamber, it was our pleasure (as
we answered the apron-man) to see, or be very near the room where all that
noise was, we were admitted and vsherd presently into a neighbor Chamber, where
by the ^^nt observance both of our eyes and ears, we might be aquainted who
they were, whom when we had well ouerviewed, we might truly perceive there was
no such man there as Mounsieur Money, ^ that you may the better believe us,
^oele describe the asse^bly: there was (to begin with the worthiest) two or
three of our own faculty and familiar acquaintance, swaggering soldiers: A
pair^ (amongst many) of threadbare Poets, men that want money more then wit,
four or five flag-falne Plaiers, poor harmless merry knaves, that were now
neither Lords nor Ladies, but honestly wore their own clothes (if they were
pale for), amongst these were two or three gun-makers, and they looked like an
Almanac dated in eighty eight, and toward the lower end of the table, which
indeed we could well distinguish by neither bread nor salt, for there was
neither, except two or three small biskets, which (I dare say) nere a soldier
there durst venture to break,) but by the condition of the men was gest it so,
(who were indeed a noise of musitions) those that I have seen at the tables
side (for manners sake) scraping manibus pedibusque, yet now admitted a place
at table, and good reason too at this time, (as you shall understand) the
reckoning was called for and within a while brought in, a mist then (with two
pipes of Tobacco) was cast before our eyes, but we perceived how it went, fire
shillings dropped from the consort at lower end, which God wot, they had that
morning scrapt out at an Ambassadors window, little else was visible, only
some of them whispered the drawer in the care (but hung near a Jewel in it)
he shook his head and went away, three parts discontent yet faintlie
pronounst, ye are welcome Gentlemen: upon this the company departed.

We thought we had stayed too long, for we might swear he that we sought
for was not there, we sent one back to the Barbar to tell him he was an ass
to guess so like a fool, and on we travail, we had not measured three cinque
paces, but we met with one that came a far greater pace toward us, and had now
reached us, a gallant (as we term them) who (as we afterward understood) had
narrowly escaped the hands of a shoulderclapper, we spurred our question to
him, who pantingly, yet out of breath, swore as God indge him he had not seen
him this fort-night, but seek him and find him be must, or it would go
worse with him, we requested his company, he told us that may we went he
durst not return, nor did he think he lay that way, for the last time he
parted and shook hands with him was in the suburbs, and if thither we would
walk with him, he would bring us to the house where he left him, we loath to
leese any hope agreed, and went with him, he brought us to a house where at the
very entrance I did distrust we were yet mistaken, there was but three rooms,
one crowning still the top of the other, and little bigger then so many of
Diogenes his tubs, where two could scarcely be at ouce, but one must be on the
top of the other, other countries (for they are common in all countries) call
these mansions. Bordelloes, or Biothells, but in our familliar phrase it is
commonly called a house of iniquity, or some-time a subaudi domus, our conducter
was but setting his foot over the threshold but he was repulst by head and
shoulders by an old Laplander and her mate, with a face like a lean tripe
unwashed, but behind her stood trembling, two or three of Venus her Nymphs
very prompt and serviceable which the Beldams stood garding like the
fire-spitting Fulles that guarded the Colchos fleece, bellowing, roaring and
rail^ng against our leader, that he had carried her b^st retainer, nay her
very maintainer from her house ( Mounsier Money) and unless he w^nt and
brought him along with him, he should have no entrance there, and so doing,
he should be as welcome as ever he was, he swore as before he had done that
there he left him, and saw him not since, she vied and revied oaths to the
contrary that it was not so.

This matter could not be decided, till one of our company, (having before been
somewhat familliar with one of the Nymphs) had privately enquired if he were
there or no, she had swore to him that he had not been th^re since the
Learme, and then that Gentleman had left him there, marry it was more then her
old patroness knew of, she kept him obscurelie a while, but not long, and
from thence he went to the Doctors, where she thought he yet was, we
considering the circumstance thought it not unlikely, and went to pursue him
this way, this was a good sent, and we were loath to loose it, well toward the
^ountebanke Doctor we go, and at length there we arrive, where we find him,
turning over his Stale books, and poring in his prospectiue, sometimes
graueld in the gravel, some-time sweating, and chasing to find whether ^were a
burning fever or no: him at his convenient leisure we greeted, who very
reverent and courteously resaluted us, thinking by our meager looks we had
been some patients, but alas our disease was such as he had no phisique to
cure, we propounded our former inquisition to know if such a gentleman lay not
in his house, he presently tied his reverence to an oath that there he was not:
he had deferu'd (he said) to have his company, but could not obtain it, and
for his unkindness he wished the yor or some other villainous disease would
catch him, and then he should be sure of his company for a month or so (if no
longer) till he were recovered again, well (after the ceremony of departing)
we had our answer and away we went: we had no sooner descended the stairs
but at the door, we examined a pair of Porters, (m^n of great carriage) yet
having no such burdens lying on their neck, they both answered ( vna voce)
that they were now come out of the City and had bin there to seek him, but
could not find him, nor did they think that he was there, but rather that
he was rid into the country this hard year to buy wheat, and meant to
turn Farmer: this reply did on the sudden astonish us which way to turn,
but being now in the City we concluded ( sit fas aut nefas) to end our
inquiry there ere we past it, and at the instant (as we were again entering)
we spied a street on the left hand (the very hand that ^ell stands on,) al
adorned like a most famous infamous wardrope, for there were executed and hung,
(some by the neck, some by the heels) many innocent garments, whose ^^st
owners themselves were hung (most of them) on the other side of the City, and
now the garments (for their masters crime) suffered the second place of pain,
and were there tortured to be purged in the air of some infections that yet
either ru^ or crept upon them, we did immagine that our lost Mounsier had been
there at the receipt thereof, but sure he would not lodge nor abide amongst such
a tribe of Jewish brokers, yet having opportunity to ask, for then met us one
that had newly ransomed a long executed suit, and had of purpose chose it to
see if it could conduct him the same way the former owner was gone. (For indeed
he meant to wear it to the proof.) of him we asked who might be the patron
and furnisher of this large wardrope, he answered us that the furnisher of that
place was as mad a hangman as any was about the town, nay there was none like
him, his name was Don Carnifexius Crackonecko Dericko, a rare fellow (for there
was none such) and it was doubtful whether he were a magician or no, for he
used to ride in the air of Pacolets wooden horse, marry he was a clown in
one thing, he never rid with bridle, but a basehalter always, and that was
but ^^ show he could rain his mare without a bit, and a mare it was by
approbation, for thee cast many colts, and that was with his unmerciful
backing of her so near her teeming time, nay (says he) he is a very
Alexander for none but himself dares mount his Bucephalus, but is in danger
of death ere he comes to the ground, nay his own servant (by credible report)
that had well broke and often managed her, for offering to get up the wrong
way, was thrown and broke his neck.

This merry description made us leese a little time, yet now we were sated
with this (having other business in hand) therefore we (somewhat unmannerly)
took his tale out of his mouth, and desired him (for hasts sake) to tell us if
such a lost gentleman as we sought might not be found in that lane, ( nodum in
scirpo querimus) he durst swear and did swear without any further
premeditation that there he could not possibly be, for all that pendant
treasury that we saw, were but baits allure him thither, yet all and more not
sufficent to bring him, therefore return if ye be wise, you fall into the
ditch else, and enter the City again, for if there he be not, he is a very
extrauagant and has no abiding, this counsel we once again accepted and
again we enter the gates, where we found much serviceable industry to intise
the Gentleman to this house and that house and indeed to every house, but
(that we could perceive) he entered into no house, the scriueners had drawn
and hanged out very fair Bonds and Indentures to lap him in, but we were very
doubtful he would not be bound prentise (at these years) to them or any one,
the milliners threw out perfumes to catch him by the nose, and so (like a
bear) to lead him to the stake, sweet gloves to fit his hand of what size
soever, but they could not come to take him by the hands, the Drapers wondered
that having kept so many men before times, (and being so well able to keep
them too) that he bought no new liueries, therefore they could not imagine,
but that he had been at dice and lost his revenues, so ^r^ke and was feign
to live retired with himself and his page a while, which was in our opinions a
likely conjecture, being himself so great a personage, well this obscure place
must we find or else we return ( sine fructibus laborum) and openly he
cannot be, unless he stop his eats and will not, but he must needs hear
proclamations for himself, as costermongers cry out for him offering him good
wholesome windebreaking pippins, russettings, apple-Iohns, and diverse sorts, al
which tempt him not, but could they bring along Cue with the inierdicted apple
of damnation, it would sooner be received at his adored hands, in like manner
cry out your Fish-wiues, Dister-wiues-Dringes, Lemmans, but none can penetrate
his obdurate ears, so general is the cry, and indeed lamentation to find out
this concealed Mounsieur as if Troy were now in her present destruction, yet
must not we (with the Greeks) lay a strain there and ^^ no further, but (
vsque ad inferos) till we find him.

Upon the neck of this meditation we fell upon a yet more hopeful accident,
we approached a post-garded doze beset round with many petitionary attendants
that waited the turning of the key that yet stood the wrong way, and was indeed
the mansion or rather kennell of a most dogged usurer, (so much we gest) and
so it fell out, for those attendants, (with whom we joined our obedient
service) in the Interrim, while the locks were set at liberty told us we had
happened right if we sought such a Gentleman, for sure there he was by great
presumptions, or else he had no being, marry, whether he would be speak
withal or no, that they could not tell, for (quoth one) the master of the
house is a man that loves that Mounsieur (you enquire for) more then any man I
know.

Nay, to say the truth, better then his child, his own life, nay (I should not
lie to say) better then his soul (if he have any) and great reason therefore he
should lie where he is so well beloved, marry there is great doubt of his
concealing, for he cannot abide him out of his sight, unless perhaps some of
his great friends (and great they must be howsoever friends) chance to request
his company for a time to take view and possession of a purchase or to the
erecting of some new edifice, and then are they on the other part bound in
worse bonds and manacles then the Turks Galli-slaues to bring him in at such
a day, or they fall into the devouring merciless ^awes of prison where no man
but Mounsieur Money can redeem them, and he then will not come at them.

This description of him scarce finished, but we were even ready to have
eye-proofe of what we had heard, we might now hear the tonguelesse stairs
tell us (by force of an oppressiue footing) that there was some-bodie
descending, which was better ver^^ed by a rewmatique disposition of the
descender, for (with small Interims) now and then we might hear on hawking,
and vomitting the best part of his corruption, that was his steame, for there
was no part of him less harming, (yet that noisome enough), anon his gouty
footmanship had reached the door, where after the quest of, who was there; and
our most humble answer, the locks and bolts were set at liberty, and so much
of the door was opened as we see the compass of a bakers purgatory, or
pillory, for even so showed his head forth the doors, but as ill a head in
form (and worse in condition), then ever held a spout of lead in his mouth at
the corner of a Church, an old moth-eaten cap buttoned under his chinne: his
visage (or vizard) like the artificial Jew of Maltaes nose, the worms
fearing his body would have gone along with his soul, came to take and indeed
had taken possession, where they peept out still at certain loope holes to see
who came near their habitation: upon which nose, two casements were built,
through which his eyes had a little ken of us, the fore part of his doublet was
greasy Satin, still to put him in mind of his patron Satan, the back part
eight penny canuas, a thing (worse then comparison) that loves not half
himself, his heart made of the palms of four felt-makers hands, his soul
not so big as an Attome, and tha^s lung-growne to his conscience, which
conscience is the true form of a hedgehog that gards her self round with
sharp prickles, that who so touches is in danger to bleed for it, his industry
is to maintain his scalpe in a warm cap, his stinking feet in socks, his
nose in sack, his guts in capons, and his brains in mischeife: to this lump
of iniquity, this living carrion, this house-kept for, that's only preserved to
stink (and the headache, which he was not good for) we (to show our
humillitie) bent ith hammes, and gave him the worshipful salute, he received
it, and grumblingly proceeded to know what we would with him? we with a
little smooth preface, as being afraid at first to fright him with our
Embassage, told him we were men that had undertaken a voyage, which if we
returned with the performance would trebble a wealthy estate for us all, and on
the contrary if we faild in the enterprise, we were undone, to give the
banckrouts phrase, (and the most common forms of a ^apsters head) broke, or
like the old Gunne-powder-house blown up. All this appeared to him (as it was
indeed) circumstance, therefore he desired to go a nearer way to it, and show
the very subject of the matter: faith we told him that we sought a wandering
conceald traveler, and that we had received certain notice that he had taken
by his lodging at his house, this was pitch thrown upon burning toe, and oil
upon that to quench it withal, that face that was wilde-fire before, was now
Hellfire, raging and boiling as if the poor harmless worms should then
have suffered torment; some flew out with fear, others were murthred even in
their Cabbins, that the blood ran about his guilty ^ose, with the very
sudden skrewing of his face, yet after collar had procured a foaming vent,
he randed out these sentences, Money, vengeance and Hell so soon as Money, he
will not bide with me, he answers not my love with his company, he has promisd
me increase, but he returns not himself, I have partchment indeed, which is
rotten sheepe-skinnes, I have Ink which is gall to me, I have paper, which is
rags and trash, I have ware, but no honnie no money, no money, no honney, I let
him forth a gally-slaue to banckrouts, and now he is sold to the Turk or the
Devil, I would I were with him wher-euer: I could hang my self to learn
wit. Had not he wit think ye that governed forty mad folks? and he hanged
himself, why should not I and you come to keep my torment in action, to
enquire for him? I have bills, and bonds, and scroules, and ware, but no
honnie, no honnie, no money, no money, with that in a great rage he clapped to
the doors, charged the locks to keep the doors, and went by the stairs (I
hope) to hang himself.

This was cold comfort still, we were now no nearer then when we first set
forward, all that we knew by what was past, was that we knew many places where
he was not: many places we seek, but that place was (as report says) the
enchanted ^land: when we suppose we are near, it is still further off, that
now we feared it would be Terra incognita:

Tante moles erant Romanam condere gentem.

Yet at length it was built, and why should we doubt then but at length to
accomplish our undertaken task, if the Libian club-man had received (by his
envious stepmother) this, as his first labor (and the age in joint
correspondencie with this,) he had never lived to number such a Jurie of his
wonders, well then let fame prick us on, that if we pursue and bring to good
pass this labor, it shall live upon our tombs (so that we bury no treasure
with us, and therefore be digd up again) while the brass and stones can agree
together.

We had now shifted our ground, and were come to the Rialto, where we hear
round about us the confusion of another Babeli, (for languages I mean not for
presumption) at this place often arriues the news from many lands, amongst the
which might be (as we hoped) some tidings of our lost traveler: faith, we by
help of action and interpretation had quickly made our inquisition known
amongst them all, but straight like honest men all agreeing in one tale, they
returned this reply, that they had received no news from any country of such a
traveler: more-ouer added that all their meeting and discourse was but to
seek and bring home the man we mist, to further which, they had sent ships out
to sea, that if they escaped the pirates, rocks, flats, and other sea dangers,
would no doubt in time happily arrive in our coast: they confirmed it by
another reason which indeed sounded more credibly then the former, marry it was
told in private, and therefore I am loath to be found a bla^ of my tongue, they
laid some, I a great deal of blame on their wives, but (for quietness sake)
I would not have them know so much, they told us, that they themselves had
often brought many of Mounsieur Moneys followers home to their houses with
great hope (in the end) to attain the company of his complete self, but
their wives (came he never so privately) would find him out, and then
(disdaining any such inmates to lodge in their houses) sent him out of doors,
and whether they went to coniurers to perform it or no, they knew not, but
straight he was transformed into chains, jewels, bracelets, tyres, ruffes of
the fashion, which still were no longer lived then a wonder, nine days, then
it was stale, and they must have a new, and (for firm approbation of what we
say) look but on our wives, and you will say we have told the truth, and we
(to please them, and seem gracious in their eyes) must follow the fashion too,
I know not by what clause in law it is remoou'd, but the burden that lay upon
their bumms is now pla'st on our shoulders, we have verdingales to bear up
our bands, as they had to support their loose britches.

This we deliver to ye in private, and you may use herein a friendly
concealment, we promised what we have not now performd, so did we as long as
we could, and that is as much as any man or woman can do, this was our answer,
and we were bound to believe it. Well, then we change our walk, and from the
change we go, where we had no sooner regreeted-the streets, but we might
behold a comely troop of white headed Senators (such as sometime adorned Romes
Capitol, when the swayed the world in a single monarchy) such as were habited
to custom and comeliness, not to fanci^ and immitation, by whose grave advise
this city did support her name, which else would quickly have turned into a
wilderness, like flowers growing in the vnbarbed field, for want of due
polishing turn wild and loose their sweetness, these gardners or guardians
of this their little viceroyship, were now approached us, whom (with a half
amazed humility) we saluted, and remembering the proverb (spare to speak, and
spare to speed) went forward to this mild inquisition.

Reverend, honorable, and worthy Gentlemen, we are poor petitioners to your
patience, both for audience and answer, of one singular demand, ( verbum molle
frangit iram,) though they might have punished our presumption, yet they give us
leave to proceed, to whom relating our aforesaid tasque, some part of the
pains we had already taken, we as brief (as we could) let them understand
our cause, and remained still attendant on their answer, which we staide not
long for, but one voice answered for all in this manner.

Truly Gentlemen, ye have undertaken a great tasque if ye have tied your
selves to the performance of it, for here amongst us, ye have certainly mist
him, (a hard case, and a mad world indeed) when all complain for money) and
surely ye prosecute your course far contrary to the purpose: for think ye
to catch ^fishe with an vnbaited hook, or take a Whale with a pursenet, then
may yeereturne with a hare hook, and an empty purse: no ye must bait your
angle if ye will come home laden. I must needs confess we have had, and have
yet some acquaintance with that gentleman ye seek for, but he will not bide
with us, I tell ye, he is a wily fellow, not woone with good words, for then
would scholars have more nap on their gowns: nor with valor, for then you
would happily be more happy in his acquaintance, nor with feature, for then so
many proper men should not want him: nor with knockes, for then would Fencers
be more fluent, but some aequiualent goodness which is an equal balance to
himself or he will not stir else, it seems you know not his company, that are
no better acquainted with his qualities, I tell ye besides this he is an
obstinat wilful fellow, for since this idolatrous adoration given to him here
by men he has kept the scepter in his own hand, and commands every man: which
rebellious man now seeing (or rather indeed to obedient too him) inclines to
all his bests, yeel^s no subscription nor will he be commaunted by any other
power, he is besides a careless and ruinous defacer of all virtuous and
necessary antiquities, so himself lie sleeping in iron bard chests what cares
he what runs to desolation? if men undertake (as indeed we of late have done)
but some good and necessary piece of work, as the re-edyfying of a decayed
gate, built new places for the profitable sweetness of the citiy, ^ee flies
away (as ye have perhaps sometimes noted) with more dexterity, then a needy
debptor has fled the hands of any of these our Officers, therefore truly,
let this confine your answer that amongst us he is not to be found, only
there are a few followers of his the better to direct and g^id ye in your
determined travail: with that we gratefully accepted some few of his
attendants, and they rid on we still prosecuted our now half hopeless
journey: from thence with few paces we had reached a fair and sumptuous
street, a place that if a man had only lived to please his sight he would
continually have made that his Horrizon, or if every coniurer had but such a
prospectiue glass of his own, they would never deal so much with the Devil
as they doe^ here lay plate both gold and silver, Jewels rich and orient lay in
beapes, here only wanted that god (by man created) money, here we made a
dilligent inquiry, but straight were we turned with non est inuentus, all
those (as they truly answered us) alluring temptations were but to entreat the
company of the adored Gentleman ^hether which if we could procure with full and
perfect progress we might command al we saw, we should be able to furnish
with plate Mark Antonies feast thrice trebled, marry otherwise.

si nihil attuleris ibis Homere, for as. This though it a little dismayed our
present business, yet it spur^ us on with a more seruent desire to seek,
knowing what infinits followed having once attained his respected worthiness
with us, we were now come to the place where the records of all ages were kept
since the creation there we turned once many leaves but few to our purpose:
never was such a search made, many taught by quint^ssece^ and a^cumisticall ^r
ra^s to make a new substance of this essence, but they were most made beggars
that undertook it: this walk we had soon walked through, now we were entered
the temple, to find him there we had not such an unhallowed thought, for there
the pillars were hung with poor men's petitions, some walking there, that if
they prai^ as well as fasted did very well and sincerely, nap the very Temple
it self (in bare humility) stood without his cap and so had stood many years,
many good folks had spoke for him because he could not speak for himself,
and somewhat had been gathered in his behalf but not half enough to supply
his necessity, here could be little hope to find him that so much wanted him,
we soon turned our backs on this place, and had as soon espied many
Haberdashers that had feits of many fashions but none that would fit this
foresaid bare-headed tall man, marry for Mounsieur Money if he came himself
(for so they answered us at the enquiry after him) he should have choice of any
felts of what fashion or block it might be his pleasure to wear, little
comfort we felt by all this, but yet we must not found retreat, forward we go
still, many hopeful places we pass, yet after our delivered message, we were
never the near, many honorable gates we left vn^^tred, and the houses
unsearcht because we wanted some of the Mounsieurs kindred to open the
admittance, yet we might hear of their Complaint of defect, and therefore
could conclude of his non residence there; at lenght we pass by that gracious
and seuera^ngly Inhabited palace, where by the dues of reason this adored
Idol should be a servile messenger, and no doubt (...), for there might we
behold the Princely messengers from many several countries guerdond and
presented with hears of treasure. But this runnagate (whom folly and ignorance
adore, as they do stocks and stones) could here have no place of authority nor
abiding, but as a mercinary bondslaue; whether go we now? Faith now have with
you to Westminster: and what to do there? shall we take a chamber and rest our
selves a while? no, nor b^^^ry neither, we will to the hall first that's certain:
well away then, and take this for a note by the way too, if ye b^^e the tongues
walk (...), the Mounsieur is there if not all is a sleep, we have now with
moderate paces attaind the entrance, lets not be unmannerly knock first, or
call him by his name, perhaps, be with answer if he be there. ^o Mounsiuer
Money, me thinks I here him answer li^e a sententious tap^^er I cannot be here
and there too here was a busy house the while, such canuas^^g of cases, that
our case could not yet be heard, here were two brothers at buffets with ang^ll^
in their (...) about the thatch yr blew off of his house into the others garden
and so spoild a Harlichoke: here two neighbors together by the pu^ses the good
man Nebuloes goose had leid an eg in goodman Corridons barn and he pleaded
possesion and the trespass of the goose that had committed burglary to come in
the wrong way: this had bin long in suit, and yet was no date to the end, only
it was thought the goose should die fort and be shar'^ between them: then one
knave was in suit for calling another by his own name, so busy they were
about these and many other such cases, that we could get never an Atturny to
deal for us, so that at length we concluded to be our own Heralds, and
proclaim our business our selves, so choosing the strongest voice amongst us,
began our outcry, If any man (women there were none) child, town or country,
of what degree, quality, discretion, either wise or ignorant, or howsoever in
this place could tell tidings of a wandering Knight, clothed in armors of
preefe, of two especial coats, either in total Argent or total Auru^, his
horse trapt sometimes in leather, sometimes in velvet and sometime embrodery, let
him bring certain notice wherehe lives either at liberty or in prison and he
shall have for his pains a thousand duckegs, and this caus^d a general silence
over all the house, there is never an one either Attorney or Clyent that could
tell what to say, till we came to a more familiar examination: And first we
began with the Clyents, they swore (as I think without perjury they might)
that he was gone from them, they came riding up with him at the beginning of
the Term, and that he did take the pains to accompany us to the Hall, and
here he was, but he is now gone, and he slipped away from us we know not how it
may be he is yet amongst the crowd: if he think you i^quire for him, to his
indammagement perhaps he will shroud himself from this discovery (and ye
cannot blame him neither to seek his safety) if you could warily observe, I
think you should find him hid here-abouts: this suffices for ye poor clients
answer we now addres our selves to others where our message was stopped up in the
midway, with Non est nobis argentu^, we have sent out executions for his
body, but he is not yet come in, some fragments (we must confess) we have of
his: marry for the substantial angelical, and most dearly beloved Mounsieur
himself, they had no acquaintance with him, nor he residence with them: This
( Contra voluntatem) must serve for an answer, necessity (being but a petti
fogger) has no law law had no ears; we had ne bells what shall we now do?
Desistere victo^? No, not yet we will yet try further, In aduersis rebus, melius
sperare supersis. Whither now: there is yet a part of ouer-sea City to search?
Shall we a board, and thither ere we see the country^ many different opinions
were held amongst our selves about this, some said there was a beastly
buffeting about him already; fight dog fight bear, the uncharitable whipping
of the blind, the old ape riding post, lacke^d by the m^zled dog and the bulls
borne-mad to have his company but it could not be, some said there were others
that off^red to suffer the Germain strappad^ for his sake, and to dance in ye
air upon a hempen cloud, nay wonders (bot^ ma^culine and feminine) yet his
presence will not be obtain'e, some others said it might be possible he was
there, for there were many hard-handed men that labors fore for him, and they
perhaps might attain his worthiness, that was presently confuted by another,
with this objection, that there we^^ ^co many caps used for felt-makers to
(...), that was ^onmouth caps, Wantig^ caps, Round caps, Mother-red-caps, and
Fu^ling caps, and none could (but bad Church-Wa^dens) bear the bell away all
this (by the help of some more comforted spirits) could not dissmay us, but to
sea-ward we go, praying for a fair wind weather, and happy success, but
here was the fright, before we came to the water we were no sooner come within
the ken of flood, but we were onlet with such a company of Carons, howling,
hallowing, and calling for passengers, as if al y^ (...) in bell had bin
im^r^soned, and begging at the grate, fi^nes and f^rks that (God be thanked)
could ver the soul but not torment it, yet indeed their most power was oner
the bo^y, for here an audac^ous
mouthing-randing-impud^nt-scullery-wastecoat-and-bodied Rascal, would have
hall'd a penny from us for his scullersh p^an other pair of water-pan^ars
would pu^ (...) fee for his (w^) Dares; and we should ride like ger^^^ (or
rather almost empt^ hosh^^ads) a (...) for it, but such hayling, howling and
pulling there was that we durst not vent^r the flood, the wharfe being so
dangerous, and further ^^^stioning y^ condition of the Sea Monsters, twas^old
v^ they did b^^ howlingly sing: for Mounsieur money that we sought for for us
the treacherous Leuia^bans had not cared to have ouerwhelm'e us, had they once
boor^ed us, well, it was, that it was so, now hey for the country we had past.

We have past the city as good council passes the cares of a negligent
auditor, in at the one side and out at the other and done no good within, hey
for the country another while.

quod non in Gallia forsitan in India. Many days we trauelld, and many miles
we measured are we re^ish any place (having the cit^y (...) in our eyes of
apprehension) where we might enquire for our departed friend and not be laughed
at for our labors, we were many times in a wood and indeed seldom out, yet it
may be this u^r dealt like a Lap^^ing with us, and cried (...) of the ne^^;

where we intended to use the authority of our inquisition, his (...) first
salufe^ us with a f^ii ^outh, which likewise served for alarm bell to tell
them within that one or more was entered the gates, upon which summons, the
goodman of the house came to the door a Jolly chuff^, a good formal
russetcoate, and a reasonable strature for a ury ^man, be were about to
encounter him at first sight with our business, but were pre^e^ted by his former
salutes, for in a plain country greeting he invited us to drink and eat with
him such ca^es as the house afforded, good stomachs are soon invited, we had
scarce the maids manners to say nay and take it, but to take before we say
nay: in we were brought, where we had cases to please five several nations, we
had the Duch-mans (...), Butter and Bacon, we might have made tosts to our
butter and varied it to another place as proper, we had Roots for the
Frenchman a Pippin Pie for your Irishman, and a piece of cheese for the
Cambro-^rittans^al these ^ifferences each one made a shift to draw to one head,
once (...) had small beer which pleases no nation: this matter being
reasonable well canual'd we fell to another discorse, the goodman was or would
be if he might (it was his own phrase) so bold as to enquire whence we came
and whither we would, we answered him we could resolve him whence we came, but
whether we would we knew not, for that we had undertaken a thing worse then the
conquest of the Indies, at which he showed us his gums and was very pleasantly
importunate to know what it was: ^ says as we had made no boues of his meat
we did not of out message, told him such an one we had long sought and him we
must seek till we and ( vsque ad necem) with all we requested to know if he
had not alighted at his house, for it was a general report in the city that
this hard year he had taken his leave of them and came into the country to buy
come: be premeditated no reply, but told us briefly there he was not nor
could it stand with reason why he should: no, no, says he, he never visits us
in the country unless it be in some contagious pestilent time, when he is so
^ni^cted that we dare not receive him, and then he comes down, marry he lies
without heers for his labo^ nay he that will not see us in prosperity let him
keep away in misery, alack alack, he now sco^nes our flock-beds, if we but
meet with him at the market we can scarce (...) his company home, our great
Landlords besp^ke him with lofty ren^s with fin^s; and Pretoes and I know not
what: dear years quoth ye? it is not we that thrive by dear years, they are
dear to be, our grain is in the usurers graner (...) it be grow^e, if we can
keep but the plowgh at the Dre^taile, ^sp^re one to fa^ against Christmas, our
care is taken, mar^y for the gentleman you seek for he is so seldom in sight
with us, that he is almost out of mind, a Scilla: in Charibdin, this geere we^^

forward: on we gee, but still no Midwife could be found to ^^liuer us of our
tra^raite, many days labor we cut of, but still (like Hidracs beads) more
came in the places, as weloy and inuencible as the other, we past up a ^ann is
boore and he confessed het had broke the statute by antedating his bibes and
taking the lean lether from the fat before the time, and all for the love of
Mounsire Money, yet he could not win his company: many tradesmen swore they
had (like knights of the Post) for swore themselves all for his sake and yet
went without him: the Lapster has froth'd half way, but whither the Devil
had let it out a nights or no, be know not, but he could not thrive by it,
indeed generally honest men, Millers and all estates did complain and lament
the absence of this their dear friend, in yt observance of al which, time and
travel had now brought us in ke^ne of a very pleasantly situated town, fair
and sumptuously builded, partly (though not equally) divided with a sweet
current stream, which both brought sweetness with it self and bore away the
anoyance of the town, with no more prejudice to it self then as a drop of
poison thrown in the Dcean, whose vndiscouerd greatness kills the opperation,
where meeting one that could resolve us, we questioned the name and quality of
it: who wondered we knew it not, being one of the two sisters (being no more in
the land but two) from whom as from two euerflowing fountains, wisdom and
doctrine continually old abound, we had little to examine further of either
wisdom or learning, but money we enquire for, and of him we desird to know if
that we thought he might not be there resident: fraith no by many presumptions
there he could not be, he guest him (though be were a great traveler) yet
he was but a small student, for otherwise he would not keep company so much
with fools, nor any ascending degree there he could not take, for that he had
attaind more worship and adoration already, the^ they could al^ow any title
for, and for the inhabitants which were all painful laborers after the quest
of wisdom and understanding, and harbored not so much as a thought too bring
him into their company, their commons was to short for him, their habits too
civil, and their arguments to^ quarrelsome, alas, sir Money has no fellowship
with them, they are rather (be it no disparagement for them, to have themselves
so termed) Liberalities beads-men, and the sons of Wisdom: these fair
foundations were raide in former ages, when this close soiourning Knight you
seek for rid a horseback in open view, without a coach or a bizard before
his face, 'twas Money that builded all these (Gentlemen) marry he was forced
to it by the great, great grand-fathere to these that now keep him back, then
was Englands whole year but a Saint Georges day, then had a Noble man a
hundred or two continually about him, but this question Gentlemen will driure
me too far in contemplation, therefore I Will take lean of troubling ye any
further, I with ye were in a better way, for sure ye are now out of the way
quite.

We now stuck fast, and knew no way out, and thought better to scramble out
the way we came, then throw our selves into some irreuocable place, we thus
resolved, turned back, and in a rage bad the Devil go with him, for we would
seek no further, the Devil was no sooner in our mouths, but he helped us to
another project in our minds, we now ( sauns fear) would go the nearest way
and know where he was quickly. And concluded certainly that his residence was
not on earth. What then? shall we give over the quest? no, to hell first:
agreed, agreed, every man choose his sworn brother (every Theseus his
Pirithous) and lets along: but who knows the way? and whither there be such a
local kingdom or no? oh yes, there is one could tell that had read
Policronicon how many mile it was to it downe-wards, that was three thousand,
(...) hundredth, five and forty mile and almost a half, this seein'd a tedious
descent, without a good pairs of stairs, and we durst not undertake it, it
was better considered to cut of a great deal of the journey, and to go
headlong, long and be there quickly, and that way was assoo^e so^^d, v^z. we
should return back to the Suburbian Bordello (before mentioned) and there to
hire hackneis would hurry us to Hell and damnation suddenly, what shall we
not do for so great a friend as Mounsieur Money? come, take horse and away.

The conclusion was put to most voices, which upon better consideration was
given on the contrary, for says one (wat it seemed was well read in the
quallities of them) it were a far ea^er (though very painful and not so
speedy) journey by land, for this way ye ride through merciless fire and
water, it is Hell all the way to Hell, and if ye will give the hearing i will give
ye a part of their caracter, yet I am loath to foul the sweet air I draw,
and extinguish with so polluted a rehearsal: they are fair outsides of si^^e,
but like deceitful bogges our-hid with snow which melted off ( vah, vah, per
Stigia vehor) I am now in Hell in apprehension, yet if the Satirist would take
this out of my tongue to give trophee too, he must confess it were pity that
beauty and brasse-browed impudence so unhappily met, there are lisping tongues
to entise, songs to provoke, tears extemporall Hienna-like to beguile, oaths
to summon an earthquake, and move the marble Geometry of Heaven, and
suddenly to bring down the pendant prodegies that ouer-hang the Zenith of
iniquity, and to those oaths their quantity in lies, (oaths and lies being
indeed inseparable companions) these raw-rosted-fire-prooued golden apples of
damnation are the very common beaten paths to Hell (I must confess) ( nam
meretrix est Ianua mortis) but the way is so foul and dangerous, ye were
better go further about: In the neck of controversy which way to take,
whither the diuill had a further hand or n^ (I know not) and meant to take some
more pity on be a little to ease our journey, but we had begotten the
happiest and healthfulest way could be devised to speak with his Diabolical
blackness. We would go to a Coniurer, or as some say a wise man, but I think
to conclude him a conturer and no wiseman, were the best moderation, for I hold
them mere Antipathies. This was allowd a perfect and brief way, (for we were
now almost tired) the Devil had sure ouer-heard us (what skill he has in
mu^^que I know not) but he has a good care) for presently was sent to us a man
(as after we proou'd) for the purpose, a lean Meager fellow, looked as if he
had been lately frighted with his own patron a poor black Serge suit (scarce
worth the naming) that if it had been artificially flamed and burnisht ye
would have thought it had been one of Lucifers cast su^es, why should a man
serve the Devil and get nothing by it? but sure it is, God can keep them poor
that the Devil makes rich.

But what is hid from the Devil himself? when one of his poor rascals can
come and prevent us and tell us what we sought: we wondered at it, but desired
him, since he so well knew our intents, to further our purpose with his best
art, he (for a little fee) quickly condiscended, and promised (if we would) to
bring the Devil face to face, to answer our demand in whatsoever, whether he
himself were the Tailor to this lost traveler, or if he knew any of his
confederates on earth that did detain him, to the one we agreed, that either
himself should talk with him, or we would if he were not too terrible,
either was sufficient, and that following night we should summon him to a
parle: The interim while then, he bestowd in preparing his incantations,
exorcismes, caracters, ^ what dues and properties belongd else to his Cimerian
Art.

But to the purpose, the night was come, we were come to the place, where we
were s^t a loose off with a valiant charge to fear nothing, our hardy leader
himself that fearde not the Devil, fell roundly to his business with his
circle round about him, where with some ceremonies, and a triple inu^ration of
great Beelcephon, the ground (not so hardy as the coniurer) began to tremble,
that we all shook for fear, anon (as if a whole legion of them had been
then taking Tobacco, and even of such a sophisticated sent) issued forth such a
cloud of smoke that we could scarce discern our artist, after that a noise
so confused as if Hell had been a fire and the bells of Barathrum had been
rung back-wards, after this storm it began anon to be a little more calm, and
then we might perceive a fellow (for sure he had more fellows) appear to us
in the shape of a miller in apparel, but as swartly as a Chimny-sweeper, to
him our valiant orator propounded the question, whither such a wandering knight
as Mounsieur Money was not traueled into Hell or no? he answered no.

The diuill (like a brave Maunder) was rid a begging himself, and wanted
Money, (whither the diuill had bin a soldier or no I know not) but our hardy
spoakesman was so bold as to give him the lie, and bad him tell him the truth
or he would force him, for he knew that he was in Hell, because he was not to
be found on earth, he answered then a little nearer the matter, and told him,
that his master had put him to soiorne in certain usurers and extortioners
houses, (very friends of his masters) and that the day of his return was not
yet come, but ere long he would be there again: this seemed somewhat likely,
but our arts-man better knowing his qualities then we did, was not yet
sufficed, but the second time gave him the lie, and laid another coniuro te or
two upon his shoulders, to tell him the truth, or he would bind him to his
good behavior for a thousand years, then out came all, he then confessed that
he was in Hell, for the most part, many spirits had him under lock and key, and
he was like never to be set at liberty again, and the reason was the diuill
had so many children fathered on him that he never begat and so many of his
own, that he had no other dowry to bestow on them, the earth was daily more
and more taken from him, as India, Virginia, and many continents, that he
thought be should have no (...) them to inherit if Doomes-day came not
quick^^, therefore money by any means he would not part with, many usurers and
others of his loving friends (...) against him for it, but he was resolved
never to give him liberty, this sufficed for an answer, the diuill w^n^ ^ome
again and the coniurer came to us where he received his reward of us,
according to our abillities, we b^d the diuill keep his Saint for we would
seek him no more.

The next voyage we vowed to make for wisdom, and wen we should have more wit
(then to seek for Money,) whom if we mist on earth we knew where to seek her
without a Coniurer, it grew now break of day, and we broake up our search,
Dixi.

Take it as it is.

Tam male nill cusum quod nuilum prosit ad vsum.
