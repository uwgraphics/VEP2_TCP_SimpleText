is our salvation nerer the^ we believed. The night is passed and the day is
come nigh / let us therefore cast away the deeds of darkness / and let us put on
the armor of light. Let us walk honestly as it were i^ the day light / not

and her Colte with her / lose the^ and bring the^ unto me / and if any man say
ought unto you / say ye that your lord has need of the^: and straight way
he will let them go. All this was done to fulfill that which was spoken by the
prophet / saying Tell ye the daughter of Syon behold thy king comes unto the
meke: and sytting upon an Ass and a Colte / the fool of an Ass used to the
yoke. The disciples went and did as Jesus commanded the^ and brought the Ass

ye all agreyng together may with one mouth honor god and the father of our
lord Jesus Christ Uvherfore receive ye one an other as christ received us / to
the praise of god. And I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
Circumcisyon for the truth of god / to confyrme the promyses made unto the
fathers And let the ge^tyls praise god for his mercy / as it is written / for
this cause I will praise the among the gentiles and sing in thy name. And again
he says ye gentyls rejoice with his people. Again / praise the lord all ye
ge^tyls / and laud hi^ al nacyons. And i^ another place Esaias says there
shall be the rote of Iesse / and he that shall rise to raygne over the gentyls:
in him shall the gentyls trust. The god of hope fyl you with all joy and peace

and the waves shall rore / and men's hertes shall fail the^ for fear / and
for lokynge after those things which shall come on the earth / for the powers
of heaven shall move / and then shall they se the sone of man come i^ a cloud

forth their buddes / ye se and know of your own selves that somer is the^

/ that they be found faithful / with me is it but a very small thing / that
I should be judged of you other (of man's day) no I judge not mine own self /
I know naught by my self / yet am I not thereby justified / it is the lord

The Pystel at hye mass on Christmas day The first chapyter to the Hebrews. A.
Brethren / god in times past dyuersly / and many ways / spoke unto the
fathers by prophets / but in these last days he has spoken unto us by his
son / whom he has made heir of all things / by whom also he made the
world. Uvhich son being the bryghtnes of his glory / and very image of his
substance / bearyng up all things with the word of his power / has in his
own person pourged our sins / and sytteth on the right hand of the majesty
on hye / and is more excellent them the angels / in as much as he has by
enherytaunce obtained an excellent name them have they / for unto which of the
angels said he at any ryme thou art my sone / this day begat I the.

And again / I will be his father / and he shall be my sone. And again when he
brings in the first begotten sone i^ to the world he says. And all the
angels of god shall worship him / and unto the angels he says / he makes
his angels spirytes and his ministers fla^mes of fire but unto the sone he
says / god thy seat shall be for ever / and ever the cepter of the kingdom is
a right cepter Thou have loved ryghtwysnes and hated iniquyte wherefore has
god whichis thy god / anointed the with the oil of gladness ^boue thy fellows
And thou lord in the beginning haste laid the foundacio^ of the earth. And
the heuens are the works of thy hands. They shall perysshe / but thou shall
endure. they al shall wax old as does a garment / and as a vesture shall thou
change them / and they shall be changed but thou art always the same and thy
years shall not fail.

The Gospel at hye mass on Chrystmas day / the first chapyter of Johan. A.
IN the beginning was the word / and the word was with god / and god was the
word. The same was in the beginning with god. All things were made by it:
and without it was made nothing that was made In it was life: and the life was
the light of men: and the light shyneth in the darkness and the darkness
comprehe^deth it not. There was a man sent from god: whose name was John^ The
same came as a wytnes: to bear wytnes of the light: that all me^ through him
might believe: he was not the light / but to bear wytnes of the light. That was
a true light / which lyghteth al me^ that come i^ to the world / he was i^
the world / and the world by him was made / and the world knew him not / he
came among his own / and his own received him not / unto as many as received
hi^ / gave power to be the sons of god / i^ that they byleued on his name /
which were borne not of blod / nor of the will of the flesh / nor yet of the
will of men / but of god and the word was made flesh / and duelte among us /
and we saw the glory of it / as the glory of the only begoten sone of the
father / which word was full of grace and verite.

with Steue^ and they could not resyste the wisdom / and the spyrite: with
which he spoke.

Uvhen they herd these things / their hertes claue asoder: and they gnasshed
on him with their tethe / but he being full of the holy ghost / looked up
steadfastly with his eyes in to heaven / and saw the glory of god and Jesus
sta^dynge on the right hand of god / and said. behold: I se the heuens open /
and the sone of man sta^dynge on the right hand of god. Then they gave a
shoute with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ranvpo^ him all at ones /
and cast him out of the city / and stoned him / and the witnesses laid down
their clothes at a yo^ge ma^s fete named Saul. And they stoned Steven calling
on / and saying: Lord Jesus receive my spirit / and he kneled down and cried
with aloude voice. Lord lay not this syn^e to their charge And when he had
thus spoken / he fell a sleep in our lord.

Jesus said unto the Jews / and chief priests behold I send unto you wise
prophets / wise men and scrybes / and of the^ some shall ye scourge in your
synagoges / and persecute from city to city that al ryghtuous blood may fall
on you / which washed upon the earth / from the blood of ryghtuous Abell unto
the blood of zacharias the son of Barrachias / whom ye slew between the
temple and the altar. Uerely I say unto you / al these things shall light
upon this generacio^ Jerusalem / Jerusalem / which kyllest prophets and
stonest the^ which are sent to the / how often would I have gadred thy children
together / as the hen gadereth her chycke^s under her wings / but ye would
not / behold your habitacyo^ shall be left unto you desolate. For I say un to
you / ye shall not se me hensforth till that ye say. Blyssed be he that
comes in the name of the lord.

she shall exalte him among his neighbors and shall open his mouth even i^ the

he went out about the syxte and nynth hour / and did likewise. And he went
out abouthe the eleue^th hour / and found other standing ydell / and said

sowed: some fell by the way side: and it was trode^ under fete: and the fowls of
the air devoured yt up and some fell on stones: and as soon as it was spronge
up: yt wyddred away because it lacked moystnes: and some fell among thorns:
and the thorns syrong up with it: and choked it. And some fell on good
ground: and spronge up and bare fruit an ho^dred fold. And as he said these
things: he cried: he that has ears to hear: let him hear: his dyscyples
asked him: saying: what manner symylytude this should be: and he said: unto you
it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of god: but to other in
similitudes: that when they se: they should not se and when they hear: they
should not understand: the similitude is this The sede is the word of god:
those that are beside the way are they that hear: and afterward comes the
devil and takes a way the word out of their heries: lest they should believe
and be saved They on the stones: are they which when they hear the word
receive it with joy: and these have no rotes: which for a while believe: and i^

and other tempted him seeking of him a sign from heaven he knew their
thoughts and said un to them. Every kingdom at debate within it self shall
be desolate And one house shall fall upon an other. So if Satan be divided

out deuylles by the power of Beelzebub / if I by the power of beelzebub cast
out deuyls / by whose power / do your children cast the^ out Therefore shall
they be your judges / But if I with the finger of god cast out deuylles / no
doubt / the kingdom of god is come upon you when a strong man armed watched
his house. That he possesses / is i^ peace but when a stronger then he comes
upon him / and overcomes him he takes from him his harneys wherein he trusted
/ and diuydeth his goods he that is not with me is against me / and he that

The Pystel on Palm Sunday. The second Chapter to the Phylippians. A.
BRethren let the same mind be in you / the which was in Christ jesus. Uvhiche
seeing i^ the shape of god and thought it not robbery to be equal with god.
Nevertheless he made him self of no reputacyon / and took on him the shape of
a servant and became like unto men / and was found in his apparel as a man /
he humbled him self and became obedyent unto death / eue^ the death of the
cross / wherefore god harh exalted him / and given him a name above all names /
that in the name of jesus should every knee bow / both of things in heaven /
and things in earth / and things under earth / and that all tongues should
confess / the jesus Christ is the lord unto the praise of god the father.

The passion on palm Sunday. The. xxvi. Chapter of Mathewe. A.
Jesus said unto his discyples ye know that after. ii. day shall be Easter a
the sone of man shall be delivered for to be crucyfyed / the^ assembled to
gyther the chief priests and the scrybes / and the elders of the people i^ to
the palace of the h ye p^est which was called Cayphas / and held a counsel /
how the might take Jesus by subtylte / and kyl him / but they said / not on
the holy day / lest any trouble arise among the people / when Jesus was i^
Bethany in the house of Simon the lypper / there ca^ unto him a woman / which
had an alabaster box of precious ointment / and powered it on his head as he
sat at te bourde / when his discyples saw that they had indignacyon / saying
/ what neded this wast? this ointment might have been well sold / and given to
the poor / when jesus understood that / he said to them why troble ye the
woman She has wrought a good work upon me / for ye shall have poor folk
always with you / but me shall ye not have always. And in that she casted
this ointment on my body / she did it to burye me with all. Uerely I say unto
you / where soever this Gospel shall be p^ached through out all the world / there
shall also this that she has done / be told for a memoryall of her. The^ one
of the twelve called Judas yscarioth went unto the chief priests / and said
/ what will you give me / and I will deliver him unto you / and they appointed
unto him thyrty pieces of silver / and from the time he sought oportunite to
betray him. The first day of sweet bread the discyples came to jesus saying
unto him where wylt thou that we prepare for the to eat the Paschall la^be /
and he said go i^ to the cite / unto such a man / and say unto him the master
says my time is at hand I will keep mine Easter at thy house with my discyples
/ and the discyples did as Jesus had appointed them / and made ready the Easter
lamb / when the even was come / he sat down with the. xii. And as they did
eat he said. Uerely I say unto you / that one of you shall betraye me / and
they were exceeding sorrowful / and began every one of them to say unto him /
is it I master / he answered and said. He that depeth his hand with me in the
dyshe shall betray me the son of man goes as it is written of him / but woe be
to that man by whom the sone of man shall be betrayed / it had been good for that
man / if he had never ben borne. Then judas which betrayed him / answered and
said. Is it I master he said unto him? thou have said as they did eat / jesus
took bread and gave tankes / brak it / and gave it to the discyples and said
/ take eat / this is my body and he took the cup / and thanked / and gave it
them / saying drink of it every one / for this my blood of the new Testament
/ that shall be shed for many / for the remyssyo^ of sins I say unto you / I
will not drink hensforth of this fruit of the vine tree / until that day when
I shall drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom / and when they had said
grace: they went out in to mount Olyuete. The^ said Jesus unto the^ al ye shall
be offended by me this night for it is written I will smite the shepeherde and
the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad: but after I am risen again: I
will go before you in to Galyle. Peter answered and said unto hi^: though al
men should be offended by the: yet would I be never offended. Jesus said unto
him. Uerely: I say unto the: that this same night before the coke crow thou
shall deny me thryse. Peter said unto him / if I should dye with the: yet would I
not deny the: likewise also said all the discyples. Then went jesus with then in
to a place which is called. Bethsemane: and said unto the disciples: sit ye
here: while I go and pray yonder: and he took with him. Peter and the two sons
of zebede: and began to wax sorrowful: and to be in agony. Then said jesus
unto then: my souls is heavy even unto the death: tarry ye here and watch with
me. And he went a little aparte: and fell flat on his face: and prayed saying.
O my father if it be possible let: this cup pass from me: nevertheless: not
as I will: but as thou wylt: and he came unto the discyples: and found them a
sleep and said to peter.

Uvhat could ye not watch with me one hour: watch and pray: that ye al not
in to temptacyon: the spirit is wyllyng: but the flesh is weak.

He went away ones more and prayed / saye^g. O my father / if this cup came
not pass away from me / but that I drink of it / thy will be fulfilled / and
he came and found the^ aslepe again / for their eyes were heavy / and he left
them and went again and prayed the third time / saying the same words Then
came he to his discyples and said unto the^. Sleep hens forth and take your
rest / take heed the hour is at hand. and the sone of man shall be betrayed in
to the hands of sinners. Rise let us be going / behold / he is at hand that
shall betray me Uvhile he yet spoke / loo Judas one of the twelve came and with
him a great multitude / with swerdes and staves / sent from the cheyf of the
priests and elders of the people / and he that betrayed him / had given the^ a
token / saying who so ever I kiss / that same is he: lay hands on him. And
forth with all he came to Jesus / and said. Hayle master. And kyssed hi^ /
and Jesus said unto hi^? Friend wherefore art thou com. The^ came they and laid
hands on Jesus and took hi^: And behold one of the^ which were with Jesus
stretched out his hand and drew his swerd and stroke a servant of the hye
priest and smote of his ear. Then said Jesus unto hi^. Put up thy swerd i^ to
his shethe: for all that lay hand on the swerd: shall perish with the swerd:
either think thou that I can not now pray to my father and he shall give me
mo the^. xii. legio^s of angeles: but how the^ should the scriptures be
fulfilled: for so must it be: The same time said Jesus to the multitude: ye be
come out as yt were unto a thief with swerdes and staves for to take me: I sat
daily teching i^ the temple among you: and ye took me not. All this was done
that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the dyscyples
forsook him: and fled. And they took Jesus and led him to Cayphas the hye
priest / where the scrybes and the elders were assembled / and Peter followed
him a far of / unto the hye p^estes place. And went in / and sat with the
servants / to se the end. The cheyf priests / and the elders / and all the
counsel / sought falls witness against jesus for to put him to death / but found
none / in so much that when many falls witnesses came / yet found they none.
At the last came two falls witnesses and said. This follow said I ca^ destroy the
temple of god and build it again in. iii days. And the cheyf priest arose and
said to him / answerest thou nothing / how is it that these bear witness
against the / But jesus held his peace. And the chief priest answered and said
to hi^ I charge the in the name of the living god / that thou tell ws whether
thou be Christ the so^e of god. Jesus said to him / thou haste said /
nevertheless I say unto you / here after shall ye se the sone of man / sitting
on the right hand of power / and come in the clouds of the sky Then the hye
priest re^t his clothes / saying. He has blasphemed / what need we of any moo
witnesses / behold / now ye have herd his blasphemy / what think ye. They
answered and said? he is worthy to dye / then spatte they in his face / and
buffetted him with fystes / and other smote him with the palm of their hands
on the face / saying / Tell us thou Christ: who is he that smote the. Peter satt
without in the palayes / and a damseel came to him saying. Thou also wast with
jesus of Galyle but he denied before them al saying I wot not what thou
say. Uvhe^ he was gone out i^ to the porche / another we^che saw him / and
said unto the^ that were there. This follow was also with jesus of nazareth /
and again he denied with an oath that he knew not the man. And after a while
came unto him they that stood by / and said unto Peter / Surely thou art eue^
one of the^ / for the speech be wrayeth the. The^ began he to curse / and to
swear that he knew not the man. and immediately the cock crewe / and Peter
remembered the words of Jesus which said unto hi^ / Before the cock crew /
thou shall deny me thryse. And went out at the doors / and wept bytterly when
the morning was come all the cheyf priests and the elders of the people held
a counsel against Jesus / to put him to death / and brought hi^ bound and
delivered hi^ unto Po^cius Pilate the debyte. The^ when Judas which betrayed
him / saw that he was co^de^pned / he repented him self. And brought again
the. xxx. plates of silver to the hye priests and elders saying. I have
sinned / betrayenge the innocent blood. And they said what is that to us / se
thou to that: And he cast down the silver plates in the temple and departed /
and went and ho^ge him self / and the cheyfe priests took the silver plates
and / said / It is not lauful for to put them in to the treasury / because it
is the price of blood / and they took counsel / and bought with them a potters
field / to burye strangers in / wherefore the field is called the field of
blood unto this day. Them was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
prophet saying / and they took. xxx. silver plates / the pryse of him that was
valued / whom they bought of the children of Israel / and they gave them for
the potters field / as the lord appointed me. Jesus stood before the debite /
and the debite axed him / saying / Art thou the king of the Jews. Jesus say
de unto him. Thou say / and when he was accused of the cheyf priests and
elders / he answered nothing / Then said Pilate unto him / herest thou not how
many things they lay against the / and he answered to him never a word in so
much that the bebite meruayled greatly. At the feast the debite was wont to
deliver unto the people a prisoner / whom they world desire He had then a
notable prisoner called Barrabas / and when they were gathered together Pylate
said unto the^? whether will ye that I / give lose unto you / Barrabas or Jesus
which is called Christ / for he knew well / that for envy they had delivered
hi^ when he was set down to give Judgment his wife sent to him saye^ge. Have
thou nothing to do with that just man / for I have suffered many things this
dare in a dream about him. But the cheyf priests and the elders had
persuaded the people that they should are Barrabas / and should distroy Jesus.
Then the debite answered and said unto them. whether of the twain will ye that
I let lose unto you / and they said Barrabas Pylate said unto the^ what shall I
do the^ with jesus which is called Christ. They all said to him let him be
crucified. The^ said the debyte? what evil has he done. And they cried the
more / saying let him be crucified. when Pylate saw that he prevailed
nothing* but that more busynes was made / he took water and washed his hands
before the people saying. I am innocent of the blood of this just person. And
that ye shall se. The^ answered all the people and said. His blood be on us /
and on our children. The^ let he Barrabas lose unto the^ / and scourgede jesus
and delivered him to be crucified. The^ the souldyours of the debite took Jesus
unto the common hal. And gathered unto him all the company / and they stripped
him / and put on him a purple robe. And platted a crown of thorns / and put
upon his hedde / and a read in his right hand. And bowed their kenees before
him and mocked him / saying / Hayle king of the Jews / and spytted on him /
and took the read and smote him on the head. And when they hade mocked him /
they took the robe of him again and put his own reyment on him / and led him
away to crucyfy him. And as they came out / they found a man of Cyren / named
Symo^? him they co^pellede to bear his cross. And when they came unto the
place called Golgotha / that is to sar / a place of deed men's srules they gave
him vyneger to drynk mengled with gall and when he tasted thereof / he would
not drink / when they had crucified him / they partede his garments / and did
cast lottes to fulfill that was spoken by the prophet. They deuydede my
garments among the^ / and upon my vesture did cast lottes and they sat and
watched him there / and they set up over his head the cause of his death written.
This is the king of the Jews / and there were two thieves crucified with him /
one on the right hand / and another on the left. They that passed by /
reuylede hi^ / waggynge their heedes and saying / Thou that destroyest the
temple of god and buyldest it in three days save thy self if thou be the sone
of god come down from the cross / likewise also the hye priests mocking him
/ with the scrybes and elders said. He saved other / him self he ca^ not save
/ if he be the king of Israel / let him now come down from the cross / and
we will believe him / he trusted in god / let him deliver him now / if he will
have him / for he said I am the sone of god. That same also the thieves which
were crucified with him / cast i^ his teeth / from the syxt hour was there
darkness over all the land unto the nynth hour. And about the nynth hour
Jesus cried with a loud voice / saying. Ely Ely Lama As^athany. That is to
say My god / my god why have thou forsaken me / Home of the^ that stood there
/ when they (...) that (...) This man calls for Helias. And strayt way one of
them ran and tok a sponge and filled it full of vynegre / and put it on a read
/ and gave him to drink. Other said / let be / let us se whether Helyas
will come and deliver him. Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up
the ghost. And behold the veil of the temple did rent in twain / from the
top to the bottom. And the earth did quake. And the stones did re^t and
graves did open / and the bodies of many saints which slept / arose and came
out of the graves after his Resurreccyon / and came in to the holy cite / and
appeared unto many / when the Century on and they that were with him watchyng.
Jesus saw the earth quake and those things which happened / they feared
greatly saying / of a suerty this was the sone of god. And many women were
there / beholdynge him a far of / which followed Jesus from Galyle /
ministryng unto hi^. Among which was Mary mag daleyne / and Mari the mother of
James and Ioses / and the mother of zebedes children. Uvhe^ the eue^ was come
there came a rich man of aramathia named Joseph / which also was Jesus
disciple He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded
the body to be delivered and Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean
lynyn clothe / and put it i^ his new tom be / which he had hewn out euin in
the rock. And rolled a great stone at the door of the Sepulcher / and departed
And there was Mary magdalem and the mother Mary sitti^g over against the

Jesus went forth with his disciples over the broke Cedron where was a gardeyne
/ into the which he entered with his discyples. Judas also / which betrayed
him knew the place for Jesus oftimes resorted thither with his disciples. Judas
the^ after he hade received abo^d of me^ / and mynysters of the hye p^estes and
Pharisees came thither with la^ternes and fyrebro^des and wepons Then Jesus
knowing al things that should come on him went forth and said unto them whom
seek ye. They answered him. Jesus of nazareth. Jesus said unto them? I am he.
Judas also which betrayed him / stood with them / but as soon as he hade said
unto them I am he / they went backewardes and fell to the ground and he asked
them again. Uvhom seek ye. They said? Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered? I
said unto you / I am he / if ye se ke me / let these go their way / that the
saying might be fulfilled which he spoke. Of them which thou gave me /
have I not lost one. Symo^ Peter had a sword / and drew it / and smote the hye
priests servant and cut of his right ear The servants name was Malchus
The^ said Jesus unto Peter put up thy swerd i^ to the sheath shall I not drink
of the cup which my father has given me / Then the company and the captayn
and the ministers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him / and let him away to
Anna first / for he was father in law unto Caphas which was the hie priest
that sam year Caphas was he that gave counsel to the ^ewes that it was
expedyent that one man should dye for the people. And Symo^ Peter folowede
Jesus and another dyscyple / that dyscyple was known of the hye priest / and
went in with Jesus i^ to the Palars of the hye priest but Peter stood at the
door without. The^ went out the other dyscyple which was known unto the hye
priest / and spoke to the damsel that kept the door and brought in Peter Then
said the damsel that kept the door / unto Peter. Art not thou one of this
man's dyscyples he said I am not. The servants and the mynysters stood there
and hade made a fire of coals / for it was cold / and they warmede them
selves. Peter also stood among them / and warmed him self. The hye priest
axed Jesus of his dys^^^les and of his doctrine. Jesus answeted him? I spoke
openly i^ the world I ever taught in the Sinagege and i^ the temple why th^^
all the Jews resorted and i^ secret have I said nothing / why axest thou me
are them which herd me / what I said unto them / behold they can tell what I
sa^d. Uvhe^ he had thus spoken / one of the ministers which stood by / smote
Jesus on the face saying / answerest thou the hye priest so / Jesus answered
him / if I have evil spoken bear witness / of the evil / if I have well spoken
why smytest thou me. And Annas sent him bound unto Cayphas the hye preeste.
Symo^ Peter stood and warmed him self / and they said unto him / a^te thou
not also one of his discyples. He denyede it and said. I am not. One of the
servants of the hye priest / his cosen whose ear Peter smote of said unto
him / did not I se the i^ the gardeyn with him. Peter denied it again / and
i^mediatly the cock crewe. Then led they Jesus from Cayphas i^ to the hall of
Judgment. It was in the morning / and they the^ selves went not in to the
judgment hall / lest they should be defiled / but that they might eat the
Paschall lamb. Pylate then went out unto them / and said. Uvhat accusacyon
bring ye against this man. They answered and said unto him if he were not an
evil doer / we would not have delivered him unto the. Then said pylate unto
the^ / take ye him / and judge him after your own law The^ the Jews said
unto him / it is not laufull for us to put any man ^o death. That the words of
Jesus might be fulfilled / which he spoke / sygnifieng what death he should
dy^. Then Pylate entered in to the judgment hall aga^ne and called Jesus and
said unto him. Art thou the k^nge of the jews. Jesus answered? sayeste thou
that o^ thy self / or did other tell it the of me. Pylate answe^ed? Am
I^a^iewe. Thine own nacyon and hye p^estes have delivered the unto me. Uvhat
have thou done. Jesus answered. My kyngedome is not of this world. if my
kingdom were of this world then world my mynisters surely fight that I should
not be delivered to the jews / But now is my kingdom not from hense. Pylate
said unto him. Art thou a king / Then Jesus answered Thou say that I am a
king for this cause was I borne / and for this cause came I in to the world /
that I should bear witness unto the truth / and all that are of the truth
hear my voice. Pylate said unto hi^ / Uvhat thing is truth / and when he had
said that / he went out again unto the Jews / and said unto the^. I fide i^
him no cause at al / Ye have a custo^e that I should deliver you one lose at
Easter. Uvyll ye that I lose unto you the king of the Jews. Then cried they
all again saying / Not him but Barrabas / that Barrabas was a robber. Then
Pylate took Jesus and scourged him / and the souldyours wound a crown of
thorns and put it on his heed and they did on him a purple garment / and said.
Hayle king of the Jews and they smote him on the face. Pyla^e went forth
again / and said unto them. Behold I bring him forth to you / that ye may
know / that I find no fau^e in him. Then came Jesus forth wearing a crown of
thorn and a robe of purple / and Pylate said unto the^ / behold the man.
Uvhen the hye priests and mynysters saw hi^ / they cried saying Crucifye hi^
/ crucifye hi^. Pylate said unto the^. Take ye him and crucyfye him for I find
no caus^ i^ him. The Jews answered him / we have a law and by our law he
ought to dye / because he made his elfe the sone of god. Uvhe^ Pylate herd the
sayer^ge / he was the more afraid / and went again in to the judgment hall /
and said unto Jesus. whense art thou but Jesus gave him none answer. Then
Pyl^te said unto hi^ / speak thou not unto me know est thou not / that I
have power to crucifye the / and ha^^e power to lose the. Jesus answered? Thou
couldeste have no power at al against me / except it were given the from above.
Therefore he that delivered me unto the / is more i^ sin / and from thensforth
sought Pylate means to lose him / but the Jews cried / saying. If thou let
him go / thou art not Cesars friend For who soever makethe him self a king /
is against Caesar when Pylate herd that saying / he brought jesus forth and sat
down to give se^te^ce in a place called the pauement / but in the Hebrewe
tongue. Gabba tha / it was the Saboth even which falls i^ the easter feast /
and about the. vi. hour / he said unto the Jews / behold your king. they
cried away with hi^ away with him crucyfye hi^. Pylate said unto the^ sha^* I
crucifye your king. The hye p^estes a^swered we have no king but caesar. The^
delivered he him unto the^ / to be crucyfyed / and they took Jesus and led de
him away and he bare his cross / and went forth in to a place called the
place of deedmenssculles / whi^he is named i^ hebrewe Golgotha / where they
crucyfyed him / and two other with hi^ / on either side one: and Jesus in the
mids / and pylate wrote his title / and put it on the cross. The writing was
Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews This ty^le read many of the Jews / for
the place where Jesus was crucyfyed / was nigh to the City. And it was wryte^ /
i^ Hebrwe / Greek / and Laten. Then said the hye priests of the Jews to
pylate. write not king of the Jews / but that he said I am ki^ge of the Jews.
pylate answered what I have written that I have written The^ the souldyours /
when they had crucyfyed Jesus took his garments and made four parts / to
every souldyour a part / and also his cote the cote was without seem wrought
upon through out / and they said one to another / let us not deuyde it / but
cast lotteswho shall have it. That the scripture might be fulfilled which
says They parted my rayme^t among the^ / and on my cote did cast lottes and
the souldyours did such things in deed. There stood by that cross of Jesus
his mother / and his mother sister / Mary the wife of Cleophas and Mary
Magdaleyne. when i^esus saw his mother and the dyscyple sta^dyng whom he loved
/ he said unto his mother. Uvoma^ behold thy sone. Then said he unto the
dyscyple / behold thy mother / and from that hour the dyscyple took her for
his own. After that when jesus perceived that all things were performed that
the scripture might be fulfilled / he said. I thryst / there stood a vessel
full of vyueger by / and they filled a sponge with vyneger / and vounde it
about with ysope / and put it to his mouth as soon as Jesus had received of the
vinegar h^sayd it is fynisshed / and bowed his heed and gave up the ghost. The
Jews them because it was the Sabothe eue^ that the bodies should not remain
upon the cross on the saboth day / for that saboth day was an hye day /
besought Pylate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken
down Then came the souldyours and brake the legs of the first / and of the
other which was crucyfied with jesus but when they came to jesus and saw that
he was deest already their brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a
spear thruste him in to the side / and forth with came there out blood and
water / and he that s^we it bare record / and his record is true / and he
knows that he says true / that ye might believe also These things were done
that the scripture should be fulfilled. Ye shall not break a bo^e of hi^ / and
again another scripture says. They shall look on hi^ / who^e they persed.

that it should have been he that should have delivered israel And as touching
all these things / to day is even the third day / that they were done / ye
and certain women also of our company made us astonyed / which came erely
unto the Sepulcre and found not his body / and came saying that they had seen
a visyon of angels / which said that he was alive / and certain of them
which were with us went their way to the Sepulcre / and found it even so as
the women had said but him they saw not. And he said unto the^ O foles and
siowe of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken / ought not christ
to have suffered these things and to enter in to his glory. And he began at
Moses and at all the prophets and interpreted unto them in all scryptures
which were written of him and they drew nigh unto the castle which they went
to and he made as though he would have gone further / but they constraned him
saying / abide with us for it draws toward night and the day is far passed
/ and he went in. To tarry with the^ / and it came to pass as he sat at meat
with them he took bread / blyssed it / brake and gave to them and their eyes
were opened / and they knew him / and he vanysshed out of their sight / and
they said between them selves / did not our hertes burn within us / while he
talked with us by the way / and as he opened to us the scriptures. And they
arose up the same hour and returned again to Jerusalem / and found the eleue^
gathered together and them that were with them / which said the lord is risen
i^ deed / and has appeared to. Simon and they told what things was done in
the way / and how they know hi^ in brekynge of bread.

Paul stood up and beckened with the hand and said. Ye men and brethren
children of the generacyon of Abraham / and whom soever among you feared god /
to you is this word of salvation sent. The inhabiters of Jerusalem and their
rulers because they knew him not / nor yet the voices of the prophets which
are read every saboth day they have fulfilled the^ in conde^pnyng him. And
when they found no cause of death in him / yet desired they pylate to kyl him /
and when they had fulfilled all that were written of him / they took him down
from the tree and put him in a Sepulcher / But god rased him again from death /
and he was seen many days of the^ which came with him from Galyle to Jerusalem
/ which are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you / how that
the promise made unto that fathers god has fulfilled unto us their children /
in that he raised up Jesus again.

my self handle me and se / for spirytes have not flesh and bones as ye se me
have / and when he had thus spoken he showed the^ his hands and his fete and

here any meat / and they gave him a piece of a broyled fysshe / and of an honey

These are the words which I spa^e unto you / while I was yet with you that al
must be fulfilled which were written of me in the law of Moses / and in te
prophets / and in the psalms. The^ opened he their wits / that they might
understand the scriptures / and said unto the^ / thus is it written / and thus
it behooves christ to suffer / and to rise again from death the. iij. day. And
the repentance and remission of sins should be preached i^ his name among al
nations.

but by water and blood / and it is the spirit that bears witness / because
the spirit is truth / for there are three which bear record i^ heaven / the
father / the word (...) the holy ghost / and these three are one / for there
are three which bear record in earth. The spirit / the water / and blood /
and these three are one / if we receive the witness of men / the witness of

sone he that byleueth on the so^e of god / has witness in him self.

and when he had said that / he brethed on them and said unto them. Receive the
holy ghost / who soeuers sins ye remyt / they are remytted unto them and who
soeuers sins ye retain / they are retained / but Thomas one of the twelve

Jesus said to his discyples after a while ye shall not se me and again after
a while ye shall se me. for I go to the father / the^ said some of his
discyples between the^ selves / what is this that he says unto us. After a
while ye shall not se me / and again after a while ye shall se me / and that I
go to the father. They said therefore what is this that he says after a while
/ we can not tell what he says. Jesus perceived that they would axe him / and
said unto the^. This is it that ye inquire of between your selves / that I
said after a while ye shall not se me / and again / after a while ye shall se
me. Uerely verily / I say unto you / ye shall weep and lament / and the world
shall rejoice / ye shall sorrow / but your sorrow shall be turned to joy / A
woman when she trauayleth has sorrow / because her hour is come / but as soon
as she is delivered of the child / she reme^breth no more the anguyss he. for
joy that a man is borne in to the word. And ye now are in sorrow / but I will

MOst dear beloved brethren every good gift and every perfyte gift / is from

us with the word of life / that we should be the first fruytes of his creatures.

Uvherfore dear brethren let every man be swyfte to hear: slow to speak: and
slow to wrath for the wrath of man works not that which is ryghteous before
god. wherefore say a part all fylthynes / al superfluyte of malycyousnes. And
receive with mekenes the word that is grafted in you / which is able to save
your souls.

Jesus said to his discyples now I go my way to him thatse^t me. and none of
you axeth me / whyther go thou / but because I have said such things unto
you / your hertes are full of sorrow. Nevertheless I tell you the truth / it is
expedyent for you that I go away for if I go not away / that conforter will
not come unto you / but if I depart I will send him unto you. And when he is
come / he will rebuke the world of sin / and of ryghtwysenes and of judgment
of sin / because they believe not on me: of ryghtwysenes because I go to my
father / and ye shall se me no more. And of judgment / because the cheyfe
ruler of this world is judged all redye. I have yet many things to say unto
you / but ye can not bear them away now. How be it when he is com I mean
the spyryte of truth he will tech you all truth. He shall not speak of him
self but what soever he shall hear / that shall he speak / and he will show you
things to come he shall gloryfye me / for he shall receive of mine and shall
show unto you. Al things that the father has / are mine. Therefore said I
unto you / that he shall take of mine and show unto you.

The Pystel on the. v. Sunday after Easter day / which is the next sunday
before the cross days: the first chapyter of James.
Most dear beloved brethren se that ye be doers of the word / and not hearers
only / deceauyng your own selves with Sophistrye for if any hear the word
and do it not / he is like unto a man that beholds his bodily face in a
glass / for as soon as he has looked on him self he goes his way / and
has imediatly forgotten what his fassion was / but who soever looks i^ the
parfyte law of lybertye and ^tynueth theryn (if he be not a forgetful hearer /
but a doer of the word) he shall be happy i^ his deed / if any man among you
seem devout / and refrain not his tongue / but deceive his own heart / this
man's devotion is in vain. Pure deuocyo^ and undefiled before god the father
/ is this. To visit the fre^dles and wydowes in their aduersite / and to keep
him self unspotted from the world.

The Gospel on the. v. Sunday after Easter day which is the next sunday

asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive it that your joy may be
full. These things have I spoken unto you i^ prouer bes / the time will come /
when I shall speak no more to you in puerbes / but I shall show you plainly
from my father. At that day shall ye ask in my name / and I say not unto you
that I speak un to my father for you. For the father hi^ self loves you /
because ye have loved me / and have byleued that I came out from god. I went
out from the father and came in to the world. I leave the world again / and
him: behold now speak thou plainly / and thou use no proverbs. Now we
know that thou under stand al things / and nedest not that any man should
ask the any questyon. Therefore believe we that thou come from god.

The Pystell on Mondaye in the Cross days. The. v. Chapyter of James. D.
MOst der beloved brethren knowledge your fautes / one to another and pray one
for another / that ye may be healed. The prayer of a ryghteous man auaylet
much / if it be ser ue^t. Helias was a man in danger to trybulacyon as we are
/ and he prayed in his prayer / that it might not rain And it rayned not on
the earth by the space of three years and six months and again he prays
and the heaven gave rain / and the earth brought forth her fruit if any of you
err from the truth and another convert him / let the same know / that he
which converted the sinner from going a straye out of his way / shall save a
soul from death / and shall hyde the multitude of sins.

The Gospel on Monday in the Cross days the. xi. Chapyter of Luke. B.
Jesus said unto his disciples which of you should have a friend and should go
to him at mydnyght / and said unto him friend lend me three loves for a friend
of mine is come out of the way to me / and I have nothing to set before him
and he within should answer and said: trouble me not / now the door is now
shyt / and my servants are with me i^ the chamber. I ca^ not arise and give
the^ unto the I say unto you though he will not arise and give hi^ because he
is his friend yet because of his im portunite he would rise / and give him as
many as ne death / and I say unto you / ask / and it shall be given you. Seek
and you shall fide knock / and it shall be opened un to you for every one that
asks receaueth / and he that seeks fyndeth / and to him that knocks shall
it be opened. If the sone ask bread of any of you / that is a father / will
he give him a stone. Or if he ask fyshe / will he for a fyshe give him a
serpent Or if he ask an egg / will ye offer hi^ a Scorpyon? If ye the^ which
are evil / ca^ give good gifts unto your children? How much more shall your
father of heaven give the holy ghoost to them that desire it of him.

together. They asked of him saying. Lord will thou at this time restore
again the kingdom to Israel? He said unto them it is not for ye to know the
times or seaso^s which the father has put i^ his own power but ye shall
receive power of the holy ghost / which shall come on you. And ye shall be
witnesses unto me i^ Jerusalem / and i^ all Iewry and in Samary / and even unto
the worlds end / and when he had spoken these things / while they beheld he
was taken up and a cloud received him up out of their sight / and while they
looked sted fastly up to heaven as he went / Behold two me^ stood by the^ in
white clothing which also said / ye men of Galyle? why stand ye gasyng up in

come / even as ye have seen him go in to heaven.

The Gospel on the Ascension day the. xvi. chapter of Mark. C.
AFter that Jesus appeared unto the eleue^ as they sat at meat / and cast i^

to all the world / and preach the. Gospel to al creatures / and he that
byleueth / and is baptized shall be saved / and he that^ byleueth not shall be
dampened. And these signs shall follow them that shall believe in my name / they
shall cast out deuyls / and shall speak with new tongues / and shall kill
serpents / and if they drink any deedly thing / it shall not hurt them /
they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover. So the^ when
our lord Jesus had spoken unto them / he was received in to heaven / and is
set down on the right hand of god / and they went forth / and preached
every where. And ower lord wrough with them / and confyrmed their preaching
with miracles following.

Jesus said unto a rular among the Pharyses God so loved the world / that he
gave his only sone for the intent / the none that believe in him should
perysshe / but should have everlasting life / for god sent not his sone in to
the world to conde^pne the world but that the world through him might be
saved. He that beleuyth on him shall not be condemned. But he that believes
not is condemned al ready / because he believed not i^ the name of the only
sone of god / And this is the condempnacyon. That light is come in to the
world and the me^ have loved darkness more them light: because their deeds were
evil / for every man that does evil hates the light neither comes to light
lest his deeds should be reproved but he that does the truth comes to the
light / that his deeds might be known / how that they are wrought in god.

Jesus said unto his discyples verily verily I say un to you who so ever
enters not in by the door in to the sheep fold but clymeth up some other way
he is a thief / and a robber. He that goes i^ by the door / is the shepherd of
the sheep. To this man the Porter opens the door / and the sheep here his
voice / and he calls his own sheep by name / and he leads them out / and
when he has sent forth his own sheep / he goes before the^ / and the sheep
follow him / for they know his voice A stranger they will not follow: but will
fly from him / for they know not revoyce of strangers. This manner of saying
spoke Jesus unto them / and they understood not what things they were / which
he spoke unto the^. Then said Jesus unto the^ again. Uerely verily I say unto
you / that I am the door of the sheep. All eue^ as many as came before me / are
thieves and robbers / but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door / by me
if any man enter in / he shall be safe / and shall go i^ and out / and find
pasture. The thief comes not but for to steal / kill / and destroy / I am
come that they might have life / and have it the more habundauntly.

one sat on the seat / and he that sat was to look upon like unto a Jasper

and I saw on the seats. xxiiij. elders syttinge clothed in white raiment / and
had on their hedes crowns of gold / and out of the seat proceeded
lyghtnynges. and thondrynges and voices / and there were vij. lamps of fire

THere was a man of the pha reses named Nichodemus / a ruler among the Jews /
He came to Jesus by night and said unto him. Master we know that thou art a

thou do except god were with him. Jesus answered and said unto him. Uerely

kingdom of god Nichodemus said unto him. How ca^ a man be borne when he is
old? Can he enter in to his mothers womb and be borne again? Jesus answered.
Uerely verily I say unto she / except that a man be borne of water / and of
the spirit / he can not enter i^ to the kingdom of god. That which is borne
of the flesh / is flesh and that which is borne of the spirit is spirit /
Marvel not that I said to the / ye must be borne a new The wynd blows
where he lysteth / and thou hear his sound / but thou can not tell whense
he comes / and whyther he goes. So is every man that is borne of the
spirit. Nichodemus answered and said unto him / how ca^ the se things be.
Jesus answered and said unto him / Art thou a master in Israel / and know
not these things. Uerely verily I say unto the we speak that we know / and
testifye that we have seen / and ye receive not our wytnes / if I have told you
erthly things / and ye have not byleued / how should ye believe if I shall tell
you heavenly things. And no man has ascended up to heaven / but he that came
down from even / that is to say the sone of man / which is in heaven. And as

Uve love him / for he loves us first. if a man said / I love god / and yet

have also accepted / and in the which ye continue / by which also ye are
saved. I do you with after what manner I p^ached unto you if ye keep it / except
ye have byleueth in vain / for first of al I delivered unto you that which I
received / how that Christ dyed for our sins / agreinge to the scriptures /
and that he was buried / that he arose again the third day / according to
the scryptures / and that he was seen of Cephas them the elleuen. After that he
was seen of mo then five hundred brethrene at ones of which many remain unto
this day / and many are fallen a sleep / after that appeared he to James / then
to all the Apostels / and last of all he was seen / of me / as of one that was
borne out of due time for I am the lest of all the Apostels / which am not
worthy to be called am Apostle / because I persecuted the congregacyo^ of god /
but by the grace of god I am that I am / and his grace which is in me was not
in vain.

BRethren to Abraham and his sede were the promyses made / he says not / in

/ the the law which began after wards / beyond. iiij. hundred and. xxx.
years does not disanull / the Testament that was co^fyrmed before of god unto
Christ ward / to make the promise of none effect / for if the inherytaunce
come of the law / it comes not of promise but god gave it to Abraham by
promise / wherefore the^ serves the law / the law was added because of
tra^sgressyon (till the sede came to which the promise was made) and it was
ordained by angels i^ the hand of a mediator. A Mediator is not a Mediator of
one / but god is one / is the law then against the promise of god? God forbid
howbeit if there had been a law given / which could have given life / then no
doubt ryghtwysenes should have come by the law / but the scripture concludes
all things under syn that the promys by the faith of Jesus Christ should be
given unto them that believe.

said. Love thy lord god with all thy heart and with all thy soul / and with
all thy strength and with all thy myude / and thy neighbor: as thy self. And
he said unto him / thou have answered right this, do and thou shall live / he
willing to iustifye him self said unto Jesus / who is then my neighbor.
Jesus answered and said. A certain man descended from Jerusalem in to Ierico
/ and fell in to the hands of thieves / which robbed him of his raiment / and
wounded him / and departed leaving him half deed / and by chance there came a
certain p^est that same way and when he saw him he passed by / and likewise a
Leuyte / when he was come nigh to the place / went and looked on him / and
passed by. Then a certain Samaritan as he iorned came nigh unto him / and when
he saw him had co^passyon on him and went to him and bound up his wounds / and
powered in oil and wine / and put him on his own be / and brought him to a
common in / and made prouysion for him / and on the morrow when he departed / he
took out two pens / and gave them to the host / and said unto hi^ take cure
of him / and what soever thou spe^dest more / when I come again / I will
recompense the. which now of these three / thynkest thou / was neighbor unto
him that fell in to the thieves hands. And he said he that showed mercy on
him. Then said Jesus unto him / go and do thou like wise.

UUhen Jesus lyfted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto hi^ / said
unto Phylyp: whence shall we bye bread that these might eat. This he said to
prove him / for he him self knew what he would do. Philyp answered him / two
hundred penny worth of bread are not sufficient for the^ / that every man have
a litel Then said unto him one of his dyscyples / Andrewe Simon Peter's brother.
There is a child here / which has five barley loves and two fysshes / but
what is that among so many? Jesus said make the people to sytte down (there
was much hay in the place) and the men satte down? in number / about five
thousa^de. Jesus took the bread and gave thanks / and gave to his dyscyples /
and his dyscyples to them that were set down / and likewise of the fysshes /
as much as they would / when they had eaten enough / he said unto his
disciples / gather up the broken meat that remains / that nothing be lost.
They gathered it together / and filled twelve baskettes with the broken meat /
of the five barley loves / and too fyshes which broken meat remained unto the^
that hade eaten. The^ those men / when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did
/ said. This is of a truth the same prophet / which shall come in to the
world.

Here ends the Pystels an^ Gospels of the Sondayes.
Here begins The Pystels / and Gospels of the Saints.
The Pystel on saint Andrews day / The. x. chapter to the. Romans. C
BRothre the belefe of the heart justifies / and to knowledge with the mouth
makes a man safe For the scripture says who soever believes on him / shall
not be ashamed. There is no difference between the Jew and the Gentyle. For
one is lord of al / which is rich unto all that call unto him.

For who so ever shall call on the name of the lord shall be safe / How shall
they call on him / on whom they by leued not? How shall they believe on him / of
whom they have not herd? How shall they hear without a preacher / and how
shall they preach except they be sent. As it is written how beuteful are the
fete of the^ which bring glade tyndynges of poas And bring glad tidings
of good things / but they have not all obeyed to the gospel. For Esaias says
/ lord who shall believe our seyinges? So the^ faith comes by hearing / and
hearing comes by the word of god. But I ask have they not heard? No doubt
/ their sou^de went out i^ to all lands / and their worlds i^ to the words
in to the ends of the world.

The Gospel on saint Andrews day. the fourth cha. of Matthew. C
AS Jesus walked by the sea of galile / he saw two brothren / Simon which was
called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net i^ to the see^ for they
were fyshers and he said unto the^ / follow me / and I will make you fysshers
of men And they straight way left their nets / and followed him. And he went
forth from thence / and saw other two brothren. James the son of zebede /
and John^ his brother in the ship / with zebede their father mendynge their
nets / and called the^: and they with out tarye^g left the nets / and
their father / and followed him.

The Pystel on Saint Nicolas day. Ecclia. xliiij
Behold an excelent priest which is in his days pleased god / and was found
ryghteous / and i^ time of wrath made an atonemente: like to him there is not
found / that kept the law of the most highest And he was in covenant with him
/ and in his flesh he wrote the couenaunte / and in time of te^ptacyon he was
found faithful. Therefore he made him a couenaunte with an oath that nacyons
should be blyssed in his sight / and that he should be multipled as the duste
of the earth / he knew him in his blyssynges and gave him an inherytaunce and
he kept him through his mercy / that he found grace in the eyes of god. An
everlasting couenaunte did he make him / and gave him the office of the hye
priest / he made hi^ happy in glory / in faith / and i^ softnes / he made him
holy / and chose hi^ out of all f^eshe.

The Gospel on Saint Nicolas day. the. xxv. cha. of Matthew. B

/ to every man after his abilyte / and strayte way departed. Then he that had
received the. v. tale^tes went and bestowed the^ / and wan other. v. likewise
he that received. ij. gained other. ij. but he that received one / went and
dygged a pytte i^ the earth and hyd his masters money After a long season /
the lord of those servants came and rekened with the^. The^ ca^ he that had
received. v. tale^tes and brought other five saye^g. Master thou delyuerdest
unto me five tale^tes / lo I have gained with the^. v. mo The^ his master said
unto him well good servant and faithful / thou haste be^ faithful i^ little

received two tale^tes / came and said / master / thou delyueredest unto me.
ij. tale^tes ^o I have won two other with the^ / and his master said unto
him well good servant and faithful I will make the rular over much go i^ / i^

and se my hands / and put forth thy hand / and thruste it in to my side / and
be not without faith but believe. Thomas answered and said unto him / my lord
and my god. Jesus said unto him. Thomas because thou have seue me / therefore

The Pystell on the Conuersyo^ of saint Paul. The. ix. cha^. of the Acts of
the Apostles. A.
SAul yet brethyng / out threatenynges and slaughter against the discyples of
the lord / went unto the hye priest and desired of him letters to Dania scon
/ to the Synagoges that if he found any of this way whether they were men or
women / he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. As he went on his journey /
it fortuned that he drew nigh to Damasco^ / and suddenly their shynede round
about him alyght from heaven / and he fell to the earth and herd a voice saye^g
to him. Saul / Saul. Uvhy persecuteste thou me? And he said / what art thou
lord. The lord said / I am Jesus whom thou persecutest / it shall be hard
for the to kycke against the prycke / he both tre^ blynge and astonyed said
lord what will thou have me to do? And the lord said unto him / arise and go
in to the City / and it shall be told the what thou shall do. The men which
companyed with him on his way / stood amassed / for they herd a voice / but
saw no man. Saul arose from the earth and when he had opened his eyes he saw no
man. The^ led they him by the hand / and brought him in to Damascon and he
was three days without sight and neither eat nor dra^ke. There was a certain
discyple at Damascon named Ananias: to him spoke the lord in a visyon /
Ananias. And he said behold / I am here lord. And the lord said unto him /
arise and go in to the street / which is called strayte / and seek in the
house of Judas / after one saul of the City of That sus / for behold he
prays and has seen in a visyo^ / a man named Ananias coming in unto him /
and puttyng his hands on him / that he might receive his sight Ananias
answered / lord I have herd by many of this man / how much hurth he has
done to thy saints at Jerusalem / and i^ this place he has auctorite of the
hye priests to bind all that call on thy name. The lord said unto him. Go
thy ways for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentyls
and kings / and the children of Israel / for I will show him how great
things he must suffer for my names sake. Ananias went his way / and entered in
to the house / and put his hands on him / and said: brother saul the lord
that appeared unto the in the way as thou came sent me unto the that thou
myghtest receive thy sight / and be filled with the holy ghost. And immediately
there fell from his eyes as it had been scales / and he received his syghte /
and arose and was baptized / and received meat and was conforted. Then was
saul certain days with the discyples which were at Damascon / and straight
way he preached Christ in the Synoge ges how that he was the sone of god. All that herd him were amassed and said / is not this he that spoiled the^ which
called on this name i^ Jerusalem? and came hither for the intent that he should
bring the^ bound unto the hye p^estes? Saul increased i^ strength / and
co^fou^ded the Jews which dwelled at Damascon affyrmyng that this was very
christ.

PEter said unto Jesus. Be hold we have forsaken al an have followed the / what
shall we have therefore. Jesus said un to the^ / verily I say unto you / that ye
which have followed me i^ the second generacyon (when the sone of man shall sit
in the seat of his majesty) shall sit also upon. xij. seats / and judge the.
xij. tribes of Israel / and who soever forsaked house or brothren or systers /
or father / or mother / or wife / or children or lyuelod / for my names sake /
the same shall receue an houndred fold / and shall inheryte everlasting life.

The Pystell on Candelmas day. Malachie. iij.
Behold I send my messe^ger which shall prepayre the way be fore me / and
suddenly shall the lord whom ye seek come unto his temple / and the messenger
of the couenau^te whom ye desire. Behold he comes says the lord Sabooth.
Uvho shall endure in the day of his coming / or who shall stand to behold
him? for he is as tryenge fire / and as the herb that fullers scour with all
/ and he shall sit trye^g and purging silver / and shall puryfye the sons of
Leuy / and shall fine the^ as gold and silver / and they shall bring offering
unto the lord of ryghteousnes / and the sacryfyce of Judah and of Jerusalem /
shall be delycyous unto the lord as i^ the old time / and in the years that
were at the beginning.

The Gosuel on Candelmas day. The second chapter of Luke. D.
UUhen the time of Puryfycacyon (after the law of Moses) was come / they
brought Isus to Jerusalem / to present him to the lord / as it is written in
the law of the lord? every man child that first opens the ma^^yr / shall be
called holy to the lord / and to offer as it is said in the law of the lord
/ a pair of turtle Doves / or. ij. young Pygyons / and behold there was a man
in Jerusalem / whose name was Symeo^ and the same man was just and feared god
/ and longed for the co^solacyon of Israel / and the holy ghost was in him /
and an answer was given him of the holy ghost / that he should not se death /
before he had seen the lord Christ. And he came by inspyracyon i^ to the
temple. And when the father and the mother brought i^ the child Jesus / to do
for him after the custom of the law. Then took he him up in his arms and said
lord now let thou thy seruau^te depart in peace according to thy
promise / for mine eyes have seen the savior sent from the / which thou have
prepared before the face of all the people. A light to lyghten the gentyls /
and the glory of thy people Israel.

The Pystel on saint Mathias the apostles day. The. i. chapter of the Acts of
the Apostles. C.
PEter stood up i^ the mids of the discyples and said (the nombre of the
names were about an hundred and twenty) ye me^ and brothrene / this scripture
must needs be fulfilled / which the holy ghost through the mouth of David
spoke before of Judas / which was guide to the^ that took Jesus / for he was
nombred with us / and obtained foloweshype in this mynystracyon / and he has
now possessed a plot of ground with the reward of i^iquyte / and when he was
hanged / braste asonder in the mids / and all his bowelles gusshed out / and
as it is known unto all the inhabyters of Jerusalem. In so much that that
field is called in their inother tongue Acheldema / that is to say the bloody
field. It is written in the book of Psalms his habytacyon be void / and no
man be dwelling theri^ and his byshopricke let another take. Uvherfore of these
men / which have conpanyed with us (all the time that the lord Jesus went in and
out among us / beginning at te baptyme of Johan unto the same day that he
was taken up from us) must one be ordained to it a wytnes with us of his
Resurreccyo^. And they appointed. ij. Joseph colled barsabas / whose surname
was Iustus / and Mathyas / and they prayed saying Thou lord which know the
hertesofal me^ / show whether thou have chosen of these two / that the own
may take the room of this mynystracyo^ / and Apostle suyp from the which
Judas by transgressyo^ fell / that he might go to his own place / and they gave
forth their lottes and the lote fell on Mathias / and he was counted with the
eleven Apostles.

THen Jesus answered and said I praise the O father lord of heaven and earth /
because thou haste hyd these things from the wise and prudent / and have
opened them unto babes / even so father / for so it pleased the althynges are
given unto me of my father / and no man knows the sone / but the father /
neither knows any man the father / save the sone and he to whom the sone
will open him. Come unto me all ye that labor and are lade^ / and I will ease
you / take my yoke on you and learn of me / for I am meke and lowely in herre /
and ye shall find rest unto your souls / for my yoke is easy / and my burden
is light.

OUr lord spoke to Achas saye^ge Axe the a sign of the lord thy god / from a
low byneth / or from an hye above. but achas answered. I will not axe / neither
will tempte the lord. Uvherfore the lord said herke^ ye of the house of
david. Is it so small a thing for you to be grievous to men / but that ye should
also be paynfull unto god neuerthelater yet the lord / he will give you a
sign. Behold a virgyn shall be with child / and shall bear a sone / and shall
call his name Emanuell. he shall ease butter and honye / that he may have
understanding to refuse the evil and to chose the good.

The Gospel on the Annu^cyacyo^ of our lady. the. i. cha. of luke. C
ANd in the. vi. month the angel Gabryel was sent from god unto a city of
Galile named nazareth to a virgyn spoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the
house of david / and the virgyus name was Mary / and the angel went i^ unto her
/ and said: hayle full of grace / the lord is with the / blyssed art thou
among women. when she saw him she was abashed at his saying / and cast i^
her mi^de / what manner of salutacyu^ that should be. and the angel said unto
her / fear not Mary / for thou have found grace with god / loo thou shall
conceive i^ thy womb / and shall bear a sone / and shalt call his name
Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the son of the hyeste / and the
lord god shall give un to hi^ the seat of his father David / and he shall
raygne over the house of Iacobe for ever / and of his kingdom shall be none

not a man? and the angel answered and said unto her / the holy ghost shall
come upon the / and the power of the highest shall over shadow the. Therefore also
that holy thing which shall be borne / and shall be called the sone of god and
mark / thy cosyn. Elizabeth / she has also conceived a sone in her old age
and this is the. vi. monethe to her which was called baraine for with god shall
nothing be vnyossyble. Mary said? Behold the hand mayde^ of the lord / be

The Pystel on saint Georges day. The first chapter of James. A
MY brethrene count it excedyng joy when ye fall in to di^uers temptacyos for
as much as ye know that the tryeng of your faith brings patience and let
patience have her perfect work / that ye may be perfect and sou^de that
nothing be lacking unto you / if any that is among you lack wisdom / let him
ask of god (which gyuethe to all me^ in differently / and castethe no man i^
the teeth) and it shall be given him / but let him ask in faith and waver not
for he that doubtethe is like the waves of the sea / toste of the wind / and
carried with vyolence. Neither let that man think that he shall receive any
thing of god. A wauerynge minded man is unstable i^ al his ways / let the
brother of low degree rejoice i^ that he is exalted and the rich in that he is
made low / for even as the flower of the grass / shall he vanysshe away. The
Son rysethe with heat / and the grass widdereth / and his flowers fauleth
away and the beauty of the fassyon of it peryssheth / even so shall the rich
man perysshe with his haboundau^ce. Happy is the man that endures in
temptacyon / for when he is tried / he shall receive the crow of life / which
the lord has promised to then that love him.

The Gospel on saint Georges day. The xv. chapter of Johan. A.
Jesus said unto his discyples I am the true vine / and my father is an
housbande man / every branch that bearethe not fruit in me / he will take
away / and every branch the bears fruit will he pourge that it may bring
more fruit. Now are ye clean / by the means of the words wiche I have
spoken unto you / bide in me / and let me bide i^ you / as the brau^che can not
bear fruit of it self / except it bide in the vine? no more can ye except
ye abide in me. I am the vine / and ye are the branches hethat abides in me /
and I in him the same brings forth much fruythe / for without me can ye do
nothing yfa man bide not i^ me / he is cast forth as branch / and is wyddred
and men gather it / and cast it in to the fire / and it burnethe if ye abide
in me / and my words also bide in you / ask what ye will / and it shall be given
to you

BRethren unto every one of us / is given grace according to the measure of

That he ascended / what means it / but that he also descended first in to

THen shall the ryghteous stand with great constaunce against the^ that vexed

iested on we were out of our wits and thought their living madness and their
end to be without honor / but behold how they are counted among the
children of god / and have their enherytaunce among the saints.

The Gospel on saint Phylyp and James day. The. xiiii. chapter of Johan. A.
Jesus said to his disciples let not your hertes be troubled / believe in god /
and believe ye in me. In my fathers house are many ma^syons. If it were not so I
would have told you. I go to p^pare a place for you / and if I go to prepare a
place for you / I will come again / and receive you even unto my self / that
where I am / there may ye be also / and whether I go ye know and the way ye
know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whither thou goeste Also how is it
possible for us to know the way? Jesus said unto him. I am the way / the
verite / and the life. No man comes unto the father but by me / if ye had
known me / ye had known my father also. And now ye know hi^ and ye have seen
him. Phylyp said unto him Lord show us the father and it suffyseth us. Jesus
said unto him / have I ben so long time with you / and yet haste thou not
known me. Phylyp he that has seen me / has seen the father / and how say
thou them / show us the father? byleueste thou not that I am in the father /
and the father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of my self
/ but the father dwelling i^ me / is he that does the works / believe me that
I am the father and the father i^ me / at the leest believe me for the very
works sake. Uerely verily. I say unto yo^ who so ever byleueth on me the
works that I do / the same shall he do / and greater works the^ these shall
he do / because I go unto my father / and what soever ye ask in my name / that
will I do.

The Gospel on the Inuencyon of the Cross the. iiij. Chapyter of John^. A
THere was a man of the Pharisees na med Nicodemus a ruler among the Ie was / he
came to Jesus by night and said unto him. Master we know that thou art a
teacher / which is come from god / for no man could do such miracles as thou
do / except god were with him. Jesus answered and said unto him. Ue rely
verily I say unto the / except a man be borne a new / he can not / se the
kyngedome of god. Nicodemus said unto him / how can a man be borne when he is
old / can he enter in to his mothers body and be borne again? Jesus
answered. Uerely verily I say unto the / except that a man be borne of water /
and of the spyryte / he can not enter in to the kingdom of god. That which is
borne of the flesh is flesh / and that which is borne of the spirit / is
spirit. Marvel not that I said to the / ye must be borne a new The wind
blows where he lysteth / and thou hear his sound / but thou canste not
tell whense he comes and whyther he goes. So is every man that is borne of
the spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto him. How can these things he?
Jesus answered and said unto hi^. Art thou a master in Is rael / and know
not these things? Uerely verily I say unto the / we speak that we know / and
testyfye that we have seen / and ye receive not our wyttenes / if I have told
you erthly things / and ye have not believed how should ye believe if I shall
tell you of heavenly things? And no man has ascended up to heaven / but he that
came down from heaven? that is to say the sone of man / which is in heaven.
And as Moses lyfted up the serpent in wyldernes / even so must the sone of man

She opened herha^de to the poor / and stretched out her hands to the nedye.
she feared not lest the cold of snow should hurt her house / for all her

purple was her apparel. Her husband was had i^ honor i^ the gates / as he

his fete behi^de hi^ weeping and began to wasshe his fete with tears / and did
wype the^ with the ears of her heed / and kissed his fete / and anointed the^
with oyntme^t. when the Pharyse which bade him to his house saw that / he
spoke within him self saying: if this man were a prophet / he would surely
have known who and what manner woman this is / which touched him / for she is
a sinner And Jesus answered and said unto him / Simon I have somewhat to say
unto the / and he said: master say on. There was a certain le^der which had
two detters / the one ought five houndred pens / and the other fyfty. Uvhe^
they had nothing to pay / he forgave them both. Uvhiche of them tell me will
love him most? Simon answered and said / I suppose that he to whom he
forgave most / and he said unto him. Thon have truly judged. And he turned
to the woman / and said unto Simon.

See thou this woman / I entered in to thy house / and thou gave me no water
to my fete / but she has wasshte my fete / with tears / and wiped then with
the hears of her heed. Thou gave me no kiss: but she sense the time I came
in has not ceased to kiss my fete. My heed with oil thou dydeste not anoint
and she has anointed my fete with oyntmente.

Uvherfore I say unto the many sins are forgyuen her / because she loved
much. To whom less is forgyue^ / the same does less love. And he said unto
her thy sins are forgyuen the. And they that sa^e at meat with him / began
to say within the^ selves Uvho is this which forgyueth eue^ sins / and he
said to the woman. Thy faith has saved the / go in peace.

world now shall the Prince of this world be cas^e out. And I (if I were lift up
from the earth) will draw al me^ unto me This said Jesus sygnyfyen ge what death
he should dye. The people answered him. Uve have herd of the law that Christ
bydeth ever? And how say thou then that the sone of man must be lift up Uvho
is that sone of man? Jesus said unto them / yet a little while is the light
with you: walk while ye have light lest the darkness come on you. He that
walks i^ the dark woteth not whyther he goes. But while ye have light /
believe on the light that ye may be the Children of light.

face of a Lion / on the right hand of the four of the^. And the face of an
Eagle above the^ four And their faces / and their wings stretched ont above

shine / and out of the fire proceeded lightnige / and the beestes ra^ne and

The Gospel on saint Mathewes day the Apostle / The. ix. Chapyter of Mathewe.
B.
When Jesus went forth / he saw a man sytte receauyng of a custom named
Mathewe / and said to hi^ / Follow me / and he arose and followed him.

And it came to pass / that Jesus sat at meat i^ the house / behold many
Publycanes and sinners came and sat down also with Jesus and his dyscyples.
Uvhen the Pharyses had perceived that they said to his dyscyples / why eats
your master with Publy canes and sinners? Uvhe^ Jesus herd that: he said to
the^ The whose need not the Phisysio^ / but they that are sehe. Go and learn /
what that means? I have Pleasure i^ mercy / and not i^ offeri^g / for I am
not come to call the ryghtwyse / but the sinners to repentance.

The Pystel on saint Myghels day. The first Chapyter of the Reuelacyon of
saint Johan. A.
Jesus sent and showed by his An gell unto his seruau^te John^ which bore
record of the word of god / and of the testymonye of Jesus Christ and of al
things that he saw. Happy is he that hears and reads the words of the
prophesy / and keep those things which are written there i^ / for the time is
at hand. John^ to the. vij. co^gregacyon i^ Asia. Grace be with you and peace
from him which is / and which was / and the which is to come and from the. vij.
spyrytes / which are present before his trone / and from Jesus Christ which
is a faithful witness and first begoten of the deed / and lord over the
kings of the earth unto him that loved us / and washed us from our sins: in
his own blood.

The Gospel on saint Mygheles day the. xviij. Chapyter of Mathewe. A.
THe dyscyples ca^e unto Jesus saye^ge. who is the greatest i^ the kingdom of
heaven? Jesus called a child unto hi^ / and set him i^ the mids of them and
said / verily I say unto you / except ye turn and become as children / ye
can not enter i^ to the kingdom of heaven. Uvho so ever therefore shall submytte
him self as this child / he is the greatest i^ the kyndome of heaven. And who
so ever receaueth such a Child in my name / receaueth me / but who so ever
offend one of these little wones / which byleueth i^ me / it were beter for
hi^ that a mylstone were hanged about his neck / and that he were drowned in
the depth of the sea. Uvo be unto the world / because of offenses / howbeit it
ca^ not be avoided nevertheless woe be to the man by whom the offense comith.
Uvherfore if thy hand or thy foot give the an occasyon of evil / cut him of /
and cast hi^ from the / it is better for the to enter i^ to life halte or
maimed / rather tha^ thou should having two hands / or two fete / be cast
in to the everlasting fire. And if also thine eye offe^de the / pluck him out
and cast him from the. It is better for the to enter i^ to life with one eye /
the^ having two eyes to be cast in to the hell fire. Se that ye despise not
one of these little wones. For I say unto you / that in he uen their angels
/ behold the face of my father which is in heaven.

The Pystell on the Translacyon of Saint Edward the King and Confessor.
THe just man will give his heart and watch i^ the morning to the lord which
made hi^ / and will pray in the sight of the most highest. He will open his mouth
i^ prayer / and will pray for his sins And if the great Lord will / he will
full fill him with the spirit of understanding / and he will show forth the
eloquence of his wisdom of sweet shouers / and will knowled ge to the lord in
prayer / and he will direct his counsayll and discipline / and will have counsel
in secret things / and he shall spehe openly / the discipline of his doctrine
and shall glory in the Testament of the lord. Many men shall praise his
wisdom / and it shall not be done away unto the worlds end. His remembrance
shall not go away / and his name shall be required from generacyon / i^ to
generacyon.

The Gospel on the Translacyon of saint Edward the King and co^fessoure the.
xi. Chapter of Luke. E.
IEsussayd unto his dyscyples. No man lyghteth a ca^dell / and puts it i^ a
preuye place / neither under a busshell / but on a ca^delstyhe that they that
come in / may se light. The light of thy body is thine eye. Therefore when
thine eye is syngle / then is all thy body full of light / but if thine eye be
evil / then shall all thy body be full of darkness. Take heed therefore that
the light which is in the / be not darkness / for if all thy body shall be
light having no part dark / the^ shall all be full of light / even as when a
ca^dell does light the with his bryghtnes.

unto the^ / the harvest is great / but te laborers are few / pray therefore
the lord of the harvest to send forth his laborers in to his harueste. Go

neither scrippe / nor shoes and salute no man by the way In whatsoever house ye
enter i^ first say / peace be to these house. And if the sone of peace be there
your peace shall rest on hi^ / if not it shall return to you again and in
the same house tarry still eating and drinking such as they have / for the
labourer is worthy of hi^ srewarde.

The Pystel on The. xi. thousand Uyrgyns day.
O How fair is a chaste / generacyo^ with charity / the memory of it is
immortal / for it is known to god and man / and when it is p^se^t / they follow
it: and desire it / when it ledeth the^ / and it triumphs crounned
euerlastyngely / over co^mi^ge of batayles undefiled / a great multitude of
wicked men shall not be profitable and evil plants shall not bring forth highest
trees / neither shall set a suer ground / and if they spryng i^ time i^ bows

plucked up with the vehemence of the wind / the vnpar fyte bows shall be
broken / and the fruyte^ of the^ shall be unprofitable and bitter to eat / and
profitable to nothing / and all the children which shall be borne to wicked
me^: are witness of wyckednes against their pare^tes i^ their iterrogacyo^ the
just man shall be in rest / if he be occupied with death

The Gospel on the. xi. thousand Uyrgyns day. The xxv. Chapter of Mathewe. A.
Jesus said unto his disciples. The kingdom of heaven is lykened to. x. Uirgins
/ which took their la^pes and went to mete the brydegrome / and five of the^
were folyshe / and five were wise. the foles took their la^pes but took none
oil with the^ / but the wise took oil with the^ in their vessels with their
la^pes also. while the brydgro^e tarried / al slo^bred and slept / and eue^ at
mydnyght the re was a cry made / behold the brydgrome comes. Go and mete hi^.
The^ al those vrgyns arose and p^pared their la^pes And the folysshe said unto
the wife give us of your oyl^ for our la^pes go out / but the wise a^swered
saye^g / not so lest there be not enough for us and you / but go rather to the^
that sell / and bye for your selves i^ conclusyo^ while they wet to bye: the
brydgrome came / and they that were ready went in with him to the wedding / and
the gate was shut up. After wards came also the other virgyns saye^g. Master
/ master / open to us / but he answered and said. Ue rely. I say unto you I
know you not / look that you watch therefore / for ye know neither the day nor
yet the hour / when the sone of man shall come.

The Pystel on Simon and Iudes day. The. viij. Chapter to the Romans. E
BRothren we know well that al things works for the best unto them that
loves god which also are called of purpose for those which he knew before /
he also ordained before that they should be like fassyoned unto the shape of
his sone / that he might be the first begoten sone among many brothren.
Moreover which he appointed before / them also he called / and which he called
the^ / also he justified / which he iustyfyed / them he also gloryfyed. Uvhat
shall we the^ say unto these things / if god be on our side / who can be
against us / which spared not his own sone but gave him for us all / how
shall he not with him give us al things also. Uvho shall lay any thing to the
charge of gods chosen? It is god that iustyfyeth / who then shall condemn
It is Christ which is deed / ye rather which is risen again which is also on
the right hand of god / land makes intercessyon for us / Uvho shall sperate
us from gods love. Shall trybulacyo^? or anguyshe / or persecucyon / other
ho^gre? other nakedness? other parell other sword: as it is written / for thy
sake are we killed al day long and are counted as sheep appointed to be
slain. Nevertheless in all these things we overcome / stro^gely through his
help that loved us ye and I am suer that neither death neither life / nor
Angel / nor rule / neither power / neither things present / nor things to
come / neither heeth / neither lowth / neither any other creature shall be able
to depart us from gods love / which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

The Gospel on Simon and Iudes day the. xv. Chapter of Johan. C.
Jesus said unto his discyples. This I command you that ye love to gyther /
if the world hate you / ye know that it hated me before it hated you / if ye
were of the world / the world would love you / his own because ye are not of
the world but I have chosen you out of the world / therefore hates you the
world. Remember my saying that I said unto you / the servant is not
greater then his lord / if they have persecuted me / so will they persecute you
/ if they have kept my saying / so will they keep yours / but al these
things will they do unto you / for my namis sake because they have not known
him that se^te me. if I had not come and spoken unto them / they should have
had sin / but now have they nothing to cloak their sin / with all. He
that hates me / haeth my father if I had not done works amo^geth which none
other mandyd / they had natte seen but now have they seen / and yet have hared
both me and my father / even that the saying might be fulfilled that is
written i^ their law They hated me without a cause.

The Pystell on the all Halowes day. The. vij. Chapter of the Reuelacyon of
Saint Johan. A
Johan saw an angel asce^dynge from the rysinge of the sone / which had the
seal of the living god / and he cried with a loud voice to the. iiij. angels

deed in Christ shall arise first / the^ shall we which live and remain be

BRethren remember ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ / shall I
now take the members of Christ / and make them the members of an harlot? God
for bid. Do ye not understand that he which coupled him self with an harlot
/ is become one body / for two (says he) shall be one flesh / but he that is
joined unto the lord / is one spirit fle fornicacyon. Al sins that a man
does / are without the body but he that is a fornicator / synneth against his
own body. Know not ye how that your bodies are the temple of the holy ghost /
which is in you whom ye have of god / and how that ye are not your own / for
ye are derely bought. Therefore gloryfye ye in god in your bodies and in your
spyrytes / for they are gods.

mother / and cleue unto his wife / and they twain shall be one flesh /
wherefore now are they not twain but one flesh. Let no man therefore put
asonder that which god has coupled together.
