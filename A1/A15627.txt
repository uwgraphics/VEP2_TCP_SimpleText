The meaning of the Title page.
BEhold; and mark; and mind, ye British Nation^,
^his dreadful Vision of my Contemplations.
Before the Throne of Heaven, I saw, me thought,
T^^s famous Island into question brought.
With better ears then those my Body bear,
I b^ard impartial JUSTICE ^o declare
God's Benefits, our Thanklesnesse, and what
Small heed, his Love, or Judgments here begat.
I viewed eternal MERCY, how she strove
G^^'s just deserved Vengeance to remove.
B^t, so en^rea^t our Sins, and cried so loud,
That, at the last, I saw a dismal Cloud
E^ceeding black, as from the Sea ascending,
And ^^er all this Isle it self extending:
Wit^ such thick foggie Vapors, that their steames
S^e^'d, for a while, to darken MERCIES heames*
Wi^^in this fearful Cloud, I did behold
All Plagues and Punishments, that name I could.
And with a trembling heart, I feared each hour,
G^d would that Tempest on this Island pour.
Yet, better hopes appeared: for, lo, the Rays
Of MERCY pierced this Cloud, and made such ways
Q^ite through those Exhalations, that mine eye
(...) Inscription, thereupon epsy;
B^ITAINES REMEM^RANCER: and, somewhat said,
Th^se w^^ds (me thought) The Storm is, yet, delaid,
And if ye do not penitence defer,
This CLOVD is only, a REMEMBRANCER.
Bu^, if ye still affect impiety,
Expect, e're long, what this may ^ignifie.
Th^^ h^ving he^rd and seen, I thought, nor fit
Nor safe it were, for me to smother it:
And, th^r^for^, both to others eyes, and ears,
Have off^ed, here, what unto mine appears.
I^dge* ^s y^ pleas^* ye Readers, this, or me:
Tr^th will be Truth, how e're it censured be,

Britain's Remembrancer Containing A Narration of the PLAGVE lately past; A
Declaration of the MISCHIEFS present; And a Prediction of IVDGMENTS to come;
(If Repentance prevent not.) It is Dedicated (for the glory of God) to
POSTERITY; and, to These Times (if they please) by GEO: WITHER.

JOB 32.8, 9, 10, 18, 21, 22. Surely, there is a spirit in man; but the
inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding.

Great men are not always wise, neither do the aged always understand
judgment.

Therefore, I say, hear me, and I will show also my opinion.

For, I am full of matter; and the spirit within me compels me.

I will not accept the person of man, neither will I give flattering titles to
man.

For, I may not give flattering titles, lest my Maker take me away suddenly.

Read all, or censure not:

For* He that answers a matter before he hear it, it is shame and folly to
him. PROVE. 18.13. Imprinted for Great Britain, and are to be sold by JOHN
GRISMOND in Ivie-Lane. MDCXXVIII.

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
Most Royal SIR:
BEcause I doubted who might first peruse,
^hese honest Raptures of my slighted Muse;
Observing it the quality of most,
To pass rash judgments (taken up) on trust*
And, that according to the wits of those
Who censure first, the common Censure goes:
Perceiving, too, with what oblique aspect,
Some glaring Comets, on my Li^es reflect;
A while I pawsed, whether trust I might
My plaine-pace'd Measures to their partial sight,
Who may upon them (e're you read them) seize,
And comment on my Text, as they shall please,
Or sl^ight, or scoff; such men were known to me;
And being loath, they first of all should be
My Judges; here, I off^r to your eye
The prime perusal of this Poesy.
For, minding well what hopes I have of You;
What course, my Fortunes urge me to pursue;
What blu^res, good Studies by those Fools have got.
Who slight desert, because they kn^w it not;
What freedom Nature gives to e^'y soul,
To speak just things, to Kings, without control*
How far from noble, and from wise they be,
Who disallow the Muses should be free;
How eased we are, when we our minds disclose;
What profit from our honest boldness flows;
What Resolutions I have made mine own,
And what good cause there is to make them known:
All this well weighing, with some Reasons more
(Which useful are for none but me to know)
I did not fear these Po^ms forth to bring,
To bide, at first, the censure of a King.
And lo, on milk white paper wings they fly,
Read they that lift, when you have laid them by.
But, SIR* I humbly pray you; let not fall
Your Doom, till you have read* and read it all:
For, he that shall by fragments this peruse,
Will wrong himself, the Matter, and the Muse.
Although a tedious Work it may appear,
You shall not wholly lose your labor here.
For, though some he^alesse Courtiers censure may
That on this Book your time we^e cast away,
I know it may your spirits recreate,
Without disturbing your affairs of State;
And with more useful things acquaint your ears,
Then twenty hundred thousand tales of theirs.
You also know, that well it fits a King,
To hear such Messages, as now I bring.
And, that in doing so, to take some pleasure,
Great Monarchs thought it just to be at leisure:
Long since, I have elected you to be
Moecenas, to my Muses, and to me.
And if my hopes in you shall be ^ere^t me,
I have no other hopes in this kind left me;
Nor any purpose, whatsoever come,
To seek another Patron, in your room.
Nor seek I now, that I from you may gain,
What, other times I covet for my pain.
Nor for because my heart has any doubt,
That I shall need a Friend to bear me out
Against the fury or the fraud of those,
That openly, or secretly, oppose
Such Works; For, He that me to this does call,
Shall save me harmless, or I mean to fall.
Not that I slight your favor, speak I this;
(For dear and precious to my soul it is)
But rath^r, that the world may know and se^,
How him I trust that has inspi^ed me.
(Though some suppose I may) I do not fear,
As many would, if in my case they were.
I do not fear the World deprive me can
Of such a mind, as may become a Man;
(Wh^t ever outward m^s^ries be^ide)
For, God will Means, or For^itude provide.
I do not fe^re (unl^sse I merit blame)
That any one has power to work my shame:
Since they who ca^sl^sly my Name shall spot,
Reproach themselves; but, me disparage not.
And, sure I am, though many seek to spite me,
That every Dog which barketh cannot bi^e me.
I often have looked on Death, without dismay,
When many thousands he has swept aw^y
On ^v'ry side; and from him have not stirred
One foot, when he most terrible appeared.
I know of Want the utmost discontents;
The cruelty of Close-imprisonments;
The bitterness of Slanders and Disgrace,
In private corne^s, and in public place:
I have sustained already, whatsoever
Despite can add, to wrong a good endeavor;
And, am become so hopeless of procuring
True Peace, (but by a peaceable enduring)
That, what remains to suffer shall be borne:
And, to repine at For^une, I will scorn.
I do not fear the frowns of mighty men,
Nor in Close-prison to be lodged again:
For, Goods, Life, Freedom, Fame* and such as those,
Are things which I may often gain or lose,
At others pleasures: and, over much to prise
What Man may ta^e, or give, I much despise.
I am not fearful, as (I hear) are so^e,
What of the Times, now present, will become:
For, God to prosper them emploring still,
I fea^l^sly attend upon his will;
And am assured, by many P^esidents,
That like proce^di^gs will have like events.
I do not fear those Critics of your Court,
That may ^y goo^ intentions misreport;
Or s^y it mis^^ seems me to dare
With such bol^ language to sal^te your ear:
^or, as I k^ow your G^eatnesse, I have known
Wh^^ ^^eedomes on the Mu^es are bestowne;
And, that their Serv^nts should not whine like those
W^o a^e your daily O^ators in prose.
I f^^^e not any ^^n that would abuse,
O^ ^n her ^a^full sl^ghts affront my Muse,
Because, perhaps, ex^eptions may be took
Against some passage in the following Book.
For, she to non^ has purposed abuse,
And* therefore, needs nor shel^er, nor excuse.
And when she pleases, she has means to fray
Th^se Buzzards, that would interrupt her way.
She d^res not only, Ho^by-like, make wing
At ^or^s and Butterflyes* but also spring
Those Fo^les that have been flowne at yet by none,
Even those, whom our best Hawks turn tail upon.
Not only at Crows, Ravens, Dawes, and Kites,
Rookes, Owls, or Cuckowes, dare she make her flights,
At wily Magpies, or the lay that vaunts
In others Plumes; or, greedy Co^morants;
Or those, who being of the Kastrell-kinde,
Unworthily aspire, and fan the wind
For a^rie Titles; or, the Birds men rate
Above their value, for their idle prate.
At Wag-tailes, busy Titmise, or such like;
But, with her pounces, them dares also strike
That furnish Courtly Tables. As, our Gull*
A bird much found among the Wo^^hipfull.
Our Dottrells, which are caught by imitation.
Our Woodcocks* sh^^owing out that foolish Nation,
Who hide their he^ds, and t^i^k se^^re they be,
When they themselves their dangers ^^e not s^e.
O^r strutting Peacockes* whose harsh voice does show,
That some sh^rpe stormy winds will shortly blow.
Our Herneshawes, slicing backward filth on those,
Whose worths they dare not openly oppose.
Our traitorous Mallards, which are fed and taught,
To bring in other wilde-fooles, to be caught.
Those Fowls, that in their over-daring pride,
Forget their breed, and will be Eglifide.
Our British Barnacles, that are a dish
That can be termed neither flesh nor fish.
Even these, or any Foul* ^he durst surprise,
If they dare cross her, when to check she flies.
Or, if that any one shall do us wrong,
Who for our mounting Falcons is too strong;
I can unkennell such an eager pack
Of deep-mouthed Hounds, that they af^aid shall make
Our sternest Beasts of prey, and cunning'st Vermin,
Even from the Fox-fur, to the spotted Ermine.
In plain^r terms; if any shall oppose
My Muse, when in a lawful path she goes,
She will not much be startled; but, go near
To tell them what they would ^e loath to hear.
She Is none of those that spew out railing Rimes,
Against some public persons of the Times,
Through spleen or envy; then, for fear, or shame,
Divulge them to the world without a Name;
Or hide their heads. Nor can those threats (that fright
Such Libellers) compel her not to write,
Unless she please: for, she does know her Warrants,
And sends her Messengers on lawful arrants.
She u^ters Truth; even that, which well she knows
Becomes her; at this present, to disclose.
That called she was, to make this Declaration*
She stands assured; and of that vocation
Such testimonies has, that I despise
His judgment who the power thereof denies:
For, yours I doubt not, and if pleased you are,
For what man's censure living need I care?
No such like pannick fe^re affrigh^eth her,
As that which does her enemies deter.
But, if she list, in spite o^ all the rage,
(And all the bitter malice of this age)
S^e dares reprove, and vex the proudst of them,
Who her, and her endeavors do contemn;
And set (who e're they be) her marks on those
Who Virtue, in her honest course oppose.
Yea, them sh^e'll make, whom self-conceit besots,
Distrust, that we discry their secret'st plots,
And may at pleasure, lay to open view,
Both what they purpose, and what shall ensue
On their vain Projects; though when they begun the^,
They placed many veiles, and maskes, upon them.
SIR, no such Toys as those do make me fearful*
Nor of their hate or favor am I careful.
For sh^lter therefore, this I brought not hither,
Nor am I hopeful, or desirous either,
To compass any private profit by it,
Or, to my person any praise, or quiet.
For, I can hope for nothing, till I seee,
The World, and my deservings b^tter be.
And, howsoever I am, now and then,
As fool^sh in my hopes as other men;
Yet, at this present, (and at every season,
In which my often we^ke eyes of Faith and Reason
Unclosed are) me thinks, thos^ things, in which
The world appears most glorious, and most rich;
Are no more worthy of my serious hopes,
Then Ratles, Pot guns, or the Schoole-boyes Tops.
If God will give me bre^d but for to day,
(And, but my soul vouchsafe me for a prey)
Twixt him and me, there shall be no conditions
For worldly honors, or for large possessions:
For, (as long since an Hebrew Prophet said,
When such like times, as these, had much d^smaid
His fearful Scribe) Is this a time for me
To seek^ preferment, or made rich to be?
No, no* for, if these days continue such
As now they be, each Groom will have as much
As has his Lord; and diffrence will be small
Betwixt the richest, and the poor'st of all.
There are enough already, who desire*
To ri^hes, and high places to aspire.
There be great numbers, who will projects bring you,
And Books, and Tales; and Songs, it may be, sing you,
For, their own profit: but, there want of those,
That would their honors, or their livings lose,
Or hazard their preferments, to declare
Those ^ruths, that worthy of disclosing are.
Yet, that is all (Dread Sovereign) I have sought,
In tendering you ^hese Lines that I have brought.
And, that by my example, others may
Take heart to speak* what they are bound to say.
I know, the ods is more ^hen ten to three,
That for this boldness most will censure me
As mad or foolish: and, my best reward
Will be this comfort, that I boldly dared
To speak the needful Truth, at suc^ a time,
In which the bravest virtue seems a crime.
I do expect this wise-appearing ag^
Should at the freedom of my Poem rage,
And, that some wi^ty Scorners should abuse
With taunting Epithites, my honest Muse;
As if she were produce'd by Chemistry,
Of Salt and Sulphur, without Mercury.
But, I am proof against their fl^shy stuff;
And for their scornings I have scorn enough.
I look our Politicians should d^fame
My Strains* by censuring them to be to blame,
O^ over busy. But, my seeming folly
May make some Readers strive to be more holy,
Then heretofore: yea, some who think they know
enough already; shall more prudent grow
By This. And I am w^llin^ to be thought
A fool, that they more wisdom may be taught.
Yet, I confess, that lately when I saw
This course, did hate, and wants upon me draw,
And that, without a Second, I was feign
The w^ight of a^l my tr^ubles ^o su^taine;
I h^lfe resolv^^, that I would speak no more
So plain, against Abuse, as heretofore;
And (thinking I had ventured well ^or one)
Did mean to leave ^he World her course to run:
Nay, from good words (al^hough it was a pain)
I fully was resolved to refrain.
But, when I silence kept, my heart became
As hot within me, as a flery flame.
Yea, like new wine, in vessels wanting vent,
My thoughts did swell my breast to be unpent;
And, at the last, I empti'd with my quill
A vein, which did the following Volume fill:
Supposing by the public Press to send it,
To them* for whose Remembrance I intend it.
But, they who keep the passage, back did thrust in
Before perusal; and, (be like) distrust it,
Because my name it cary'd, to be such
As might upon their friends too nearly touch.
For, some of them have said; that were my writing
As true as that of holy John's inditing,
They would not license it: so fearful are
These guilty Times the voice of Truth to hear.
When therefore, I had this my Offering brought,
And laid it at their door; a while I thought
My self discharged: but, my Conscience said,
My work was lost, and still my vow unpaid,
Till I had practiced every likely way,
To tell the Message which I had to say.
And, since the common way it might not pass,
To bring it by your Gate, resolved I was.
My first determining of such a thing,
Did many several doubts upon me bring*
One while I doubted, that those fools who mock
At piety, would make a laughing stock
Of this and me: and say (with some disdain)
That I would make my self a Prophet feign:
And puffed with self conceit, had pe^n'd a Story
For private ends, and for mine own vain glory.
Or, that with pride and arrogance deluded,
I had upon undecent things intruded.
Another while I doubted some would prate,
That these my Lines dishono^e^ the State,
And on the Government aspersions laid*
As of their warnings often the Jews have said.
Sometime I feared, all my words would make
But few or none the better heed to take.
Because I read, that many a Prophet spoke,
What, small effect within his life time took,
Except, in aggravating of abuses,
And leaving them the more without excuses.
Sometime again, I feared lest if You
Referring this my Poem to their view
Who misconceive it may, (and trusting them
In censuring, who causl^sly condemn
Men innocent) might, by that evil chance
Be wronged; and suffer for their ignorance.
^hus Kings are often injured: and, some perish
In their disl^ke, whom they are ^ound to cherish.
I s^w* moreover, that my Foes, of late,
Had so much wronged me in my estat^,
By ne^dlesse charge, and causles^e hindering me,
From those due profits, which my Portion be;
That to recover them, (and to pursue
My law^ull right) I have^ no means but you,
And your just favor. Which, if I should miss,
(By giving to your ear distaste in this)
My adversaries would prevail, I thought,
And, my disgrace, and ruin would be wrought.
These carnal doubt^* and many other such,
Against my Reason did pr^vaile so much,
That I was half afraid to venture on
In that, which ought with courage to be done.
But, whilst I staggered, and began to stay,
Me thought, within me, somewhat thus did say.
Base Coward; has God's love so many days,
To thee appeared; and so many ways?
Have thou so often felt, what thou do know,
From nothing, but the power of God can fl^w?
Has he so plai^ly told thee, with what wiles,
The foolish world, her self, and those beg^iles
That harken to her? Has he made thee see
How little harm, her spite can do to thee?
Nay, has he pleased bin to bring unto thee,
Great profits, by those injuries men do thee.
And, shall the fear but of a paltry scoff,
From that which he appoints, beat thee off?
Has he so often kept thee from disgrace,
And fed and clothed thee, m^erely o^ his grace,
That thou shouldft now distrust he will deceive thee,
And, when he sends thee on his Message, leave thee,
Without those necessaries, which pertain
To those who in his Service do remain?
Has he no meane^ to b^ing thee fit supplies,
But such as thine own wisdom can devise?
Has God destroyed so many of thy hopes,
And do thou build them still on carnal props?
Did thou so many times, in secret vow
Affiance in hi^ promises? and, now
Have thou no surer helps to trust unt^,
Then Kings and P^inces? And, as others do
(Who have not thy experience) do thou shrink
As soon as any outward Stay does sink*
Would thou thy God displease, to keep a friend,
Perhaps in vain, for some poor temporal end?
Is It now a Season (when the Lands transgressions
Have shaken all) to settle thy Poss^ssions?
When all the I own about thee is on fire,
Would thou go build thy straw-clad Cottage hyer?
Well; take thy course. Yet, know, if thou forbear
What now thy Conscience bids thee to declare,
Thy foolish Hope shall fail thee, never the less;
Thy wrongful suffering shall h^ve no redress;
Thou shall have greater wants then pinch thee yet;
New sorrows, and disgraces, thou shall get
In stead of help; and, which is worst of all,
A guilty Conscience, too, torment thee shall.
^hen, be advised, and proceed to do
That lawful Act, thy heart enclines unto;
And, be thou sure, that God will make thee strong
Against the violence of every wrong.
Be stout; and though all persons through the Land,
Even Prince and People both, should thee withstand,
Their opposition nothing harm thee shall;
But, thou shall bide them like a brazen wall;
And if thou suffer persecutions flame,
Thou shall be but refined in ^he same.
Such thoughts we^e whisp^r'd in me. And though some
May think them vain suggestions, flowing from
Distempered Fa^cy; I dare boldly say,
They lie: And, I their motives do obey.
All doubts, and fears* and stops, are broken through,
And lo (Dread Sov'raigne) I have brought to you
(In all humil^tie) my self and these
My honest and my just REMEMBRANCES:
To pass, for those, to whom they appertain;
Or, here for my discharging to remain.
God is already angry (I Am afraid)
Because this duty I so long delaid.
And, stand, or fall, now I have reached thereto,
I would not, for the world, it were to do.
Good SIR, reject it not, although it bring
Appearances of some fantastic thing,
At first unfolding: for* those Mysteries
Which we most honor, and most highly prise,
Do seem to be but foolishness to some.
And, when our sin to any height is come,
It brings a height of folly, which often makes
That course to seem uncomely, that God takes
For our reproof, (and chiefly) if it carry
The show of any way not ordinary.
Which (out of doubt) is requisite* when sin
That Is extraordinary breaks in.
Believe not those, who reasons will invent,
To make this Volume seem impertinent:
For, what is more of moment, then a story
Which mentions to God Almighties glory,
His Judgments, and his Mercies? and does show
Those things that may prevent our overthrow?
Sure, nothing is more worthy of regard:
And though a foolish tale be sooner heard,
Yet, in respect thereof, the glorioust things,
That stand upon record of earthly Kings,
Appear to me as vain, as large discourses
Of childish May-games, and of Hobby-horse^.
Give ear to none, I pray you, who shall seek
To move, within your Highness, a dislike
To my unusual boldness, or my phrase:
For, who does listen to an honest cause
In these regardlesse times, unless it be
So dr^^t, as if it seemed to say; Come see
What Is here to do. Men's wits are fallen asleep;
And, if I do not some strange rumbling keep,
(That is not look^ for) they no heed will take,
Of what I say, how true soever I speak.
I know there be Occasion^, Times, and Causes,
Which do r^quire so^t words, and lowly Phrases:
And, then, l^ke other men, I ^each my Muse
To sp^ake such language as my neighbors use.
But, there ^^e also Times which will require,
That we should wi^h our Numbers mingle fire:
And, then I vent bold words; that You, and They
Who come to hear them, take occasion may
To ask or to examine, what is the matter,
My Verse speaks tartly, when most Writers flatter.
For, by that means, you may experience'd grow
In many things which else you should not know.
My ^ines are loyal, though they bold appear:
And thou^h at first, they make some ^eaders fear
I want goo^ manners; yet, when they are w^igh'd,
It will be foun^ that I have nothing said,
In manner, or in matter worthy blame,
If they alone shall j^dge me for the same,
Who know t^u^ Virtues language; and how free
From gl^zing terms, her Servants use to be.
Though bold I seem to some that Cowards are,
Yet, you I hope, shall find, I neither d^re
Thin^s that or need^esse be, or desperate;
O^, that ^oo^e to be wondered at
Among those fools, who love to hear it said,
That they to break their necks were not afr^id.
For, as a Seaman, when the Mast he climbes,
Is safe enough* thou^h he in danger seems
To some beholders: So, although that Path,
In which I tread, a show of peril^ has
To those who see not what fast hold I take,
My ^tanding will be firm, when theirs does shake.
And, if I fall, I fall not by this Act,
But, by their malice, who dislike the Fact.
Heed none I pray, that has so little shame,
To say these times are not so much to blame
As I have made them seem: ^or, worse they are
Then I have yet expressed them, by far*
And, much I fear^, that ^hey who most defend them,
Will make them to be worse, before they mend them.
Nor doubt you, Royal SIR, that from the story
Of your just reign, or from your future glory,
It ought shall derogate, to hear it told,
Such evils, whilst you reigned, were contrould.
For, we do read, that Kings who pioust were,
Had wicked Subjects. And, beside, you are
So late enthroned, that your government
Could little inso small a time augment
Their being good or ill: But, you shall gain
The greater glory, if you can restrain
(And keep from growing worse) a time, b^come
So grossly wicked, and so troublesome.
If any other way my Verse be wronged,
By Readers ill advised, or evil tongued,
Vouchsafe to spare your censure, till you hear
What ^ust replies to their Objections are.
Or, if that any to disparage this,
To yo^, shall of my life report amiss;
Reject their scandals (for your own dear sake)
And let them no impression on you make.
For, evil tongues sometimes will set their stings
Unjustly, on the sacred name of Kings
Much more on mine. But, for my own repute,
So careful am I no^ to make this suit,
But for my Muses honor. For, in all
My outward actions, I dare boldly call
Your strictest Laws to censure me. And what
I am to God, it may be guessed at,
But rightly known, to none but him, and me.
And, though from outward scapes I stand not free,
Yet, let this Mess^ge her due merit win:
For, Gods most holy Prophets had their sin.
As in a Glass, here may you, by reflection,
Behold (without the hazard ^f infection)
The horrid Pestilence in her true form,
Which in your Kingdom did so lately storm;
And is so soon forgotten, that I err,
Unless there needs a REMEMBRANCER.
Hereby, succeeding Times, in such like terrors,
May learn to see and to prevent some errors.
Here, understand you may (without false gloze)
What heretofore your people did suppose
Of You: Their hopes before your Coronation,
And what hat^ been since then their expecta^ion.
Here, you may partly see, what you of them
May hope: what you should cherish or condemn.
Here, view you may (before too far they steal)
The sicknesses of Church and Commonweal:
What b^ings upon your Person, and ^he State,
Such ca^e, and so much trouble as of late:
What marres your Counsels, and what undermines
Your most approved, and most wise designs:
What makes your Arms, your Vertu^s, and your Friends
So little helpful to your pious ends:
What makes your Fl^ets return without success;
What breeds doubtings and unsetlednesse
In weighty matters* and whence discord springs
Among the People, and twixt them and Kings.
And, if it well observed be perchance,
What seems to most a trifling circumstance,
Shall of it self inform, or else prepare
To signify those things that weightiest are:
For, they who can my Muses reach discern
Shall find, that what most think does but concern
My person only; may to that conduce,
Which serves to public, and to p^ivate use.
Moreover* this Rem^mbrancer does show,
To what the folly of these times will grow;
And, what in future days will surely fall
If we our courses long continue shall.
He, lastly does declare the certain way,
By which, ensuing harms prevent we may;
Take off the skars, our passed sins have given,
And, make our present peace with earth and heaven.
Dear SIR; as you your honor do respect
For times to come: as you do now affect
Your present comforts, and those hopes that are
The pledges of that Crown, you look to wear,
(When you must leave that golden Crown of thorns,
Which pains your head, as much as it a^ornes)
Give heed to these Remembrances: Command them
To pass, in spite of such as would withstand them.
Do you reform, according to your powers.
In every quarter of this I Will of yours,
Give w^y to Reformation. In the Crimes,
And many crying sins, of these lewd times,
Be you no partner, by conniving at
Their Actors; or, discountenancing that
Which may disable them to tyrannize;
Who will to hide old sins, new faults devise.
And, do not for some few reserve that ear,
Which should the suit of every Subject hear.
But, as you have been, yet, (and as I trust
You shall continue) be in all things just;
And as upright, as him it may befit,
Who does in place of God Almighty sit;
That you and yours* may still in safety stand,
What plague soever fall upon the Land.
And, let not my Petition be condemned,
As over bold; or my advice contemned,
Because a man despised gives the sa^e;
For, sel^ome hi^herto, a M^ss^ge came
From God, on such occasions, ^ut some one
In outward show, scarce worthy thinking on,
Was made the Messenger. All heavenly graces
Are not entailed on men of highest places:
Nor is all that which every Prelate says,
To be believed as Gospel^ now adays.
God still (as heretofore) calls vulgar men
To speak his will to Princes, now and then:
Yea, to delude the World, or to deride
Her arrogant vain glory, and her p^iee,
God checks her often, by those of whom we see
She most of all disdaines reproved to be:
That, so her loftin^sse he may debase,
And to the lowly minded show his grace.
It pe^adventu^e may be though^ I come
With nothing else but gleaning^, gathered from
The common Rumors, (which I feign would s^r^w
Abroad again, to publ^sh what I know)
But, let me^ judge their pleasures: I am free
From those poor ends; and, so still hope to be.
In this, I moved not, of ^ine own^ intent,
Nor am I, SIR, by any Mortal sent:
More strong is my Commission. And, what e're
It seems to those who una^quainted are
With Gods Characters, and his Privy seal,
The Times to come shall openly reve^le
What these perceive not; and, it shall be seen,
That I have warrantably called b^ene.
Mean time my Cons^ience knows I have not run
With rashness into that which I have done;
But, rather that I maugre mine own will,
Was rouzed up, and spurred onward still,
In this performance; when my Cowardice,
My Sloth, my Pleasures, or my Ava^ice,
Or worldly Po^icie^, their b^its did lay,
To tempt and draw my heart another way.
Yea, so untoward was I ^o conform
My Will, this uncouth Action to perform,
That, many times I quite gave off to do
What I ha^ vowed, and set hand unto.
For, had not God by terror^* wants, distraction^*
And crossing all those temporal hopes and actions
Which I attempted, since I first began
This task: or, if he had not now and than
Among those lashes, mixed comfortings,
And apprehensions of diviner things
Then flesh and blood informs (as, no doubt,
This Book will prove to some who read it out)
I neither should have known what I have told,
Nor dared in these times to be so bold.
For, when the World can tempt me for a day,
To cast such Meditations quite away,
(And plod, as others do* in her affairs,)
My Courage, and my Comforts, it impaires.
And, if I happen then, to over-looke
Some passages in this ensuing Book,
I wonder at their boldness, just as much
As he, whose heart had never such a touch:
And, till by reading them, new fire I take,
My own Expressions, me do fearful make.
Yet, here are poor and slender things, to that
Which of these Times, time coming will relate:
For though my Fortune has obscured me,
Yet in all matters might it fitting be
For me to speak my knowledge of those things
Which to my ear and eye, Occasion brings,
So many sad Rel^tions I could make,
That every ho^est Re^ders heart would ache;
And think this Nation fo^lish, (if not mad)
O^, that all Reason quit^ forsook us had.
Yea, had I means to prove to every man,
What to my own experience prove I can;
Or were it meet, in public to declare
All things which known, and unconsidered are;
My Muse would make, perhaps even those to grieve,
(And tremble too) w^o do nor yet believe,
Nor care to know how desp'rately diseased
This Land is grown. How ever they are pleased
Who have distempered it; to you I trust
I^ shall not be distasteful, that I must
Dilate my mind a little, in such wise,
That you may see how sick your Kingdom lie^.
For, that alone which fits me to disclose,
And what is already known to friends and foes
My Verse discouers. Yea what to conceal
More h^rmes, then profits your Commonweal,
Is here in part comm^moriz'd, to show
That we con^ider not the things we know.
And, if I shall miscarie for declaring
These ne^dfull Truths, (and, for this honest darin^)
A rush I care not. F^r, I Would rather die
Alo^e, before th^se days of misery
That s^eeme to be approaching (and for saying
What (being beeded) might procure the staying
Of universal Plagues) then live and perish
With fools, who do themselves for slaught^r nourish.
I am no Statesm^n, neither (by pretense
Of having gotten large intelligence)
Would I insinuate for more esteem
Then I d^serve; or, to deserve may seem.
But, being set on such a middling height,
Where I (by God's permission) have the sight
Of many things (which they shall never see
Who far above, or far below me be)
What I observe, I ponder, and compare;
And, what I think may profit, I declare.
I therefore hope, what e're the pe^s^n s^eme,
The matter shall procure it self est^eme:
And, mak^ this age to know, there is majesty
In simplest Truth; and such authority
As will command regard, though want it shall
Those glorious garbs which falsehood jets withal.
I hope to see all Virtue shine in You;
And that your good example will renew
Decaying Piety. I likewise hope
That these Remembrances shall find no stop
By your appointment, nor by any power
Which takes her authority from yaur.
For, when it shall be seen, that you give way
To publish T^is: your people justly may,
(And will) affirm, that you are still the same
They hoped of you: that you also blame
As much as any, what disordered is;
And, that you se^ke to mend what is found amiss:
Yea, they that else will storm and vex to see
My Lines, thus ^old, w^ll calm and quiet be.
However; I have said, and, I have done;
Let what God pleases follow thereupon.
My heart is fixed; and I up have taken
Those Resolutions, that will stand unshaken,
(I t^ust) though Earth should sink, and all the Sphere:
Come thundering down in flames about my ears.
Which Hopes of mine* some will, perchance deride,
And fo^le themselves, to see my patience tried
By what they can inflict, (unless you stay
That rage, to which my Verse provoke them may)
But, see your Honor be not wron^ed by it,
And, let them do their w^rs^; for I defy it:
Because I know, what e're the spite of man*
Against this Poem, speak or practice can*
It shall continue, when all those be rotten,
Or live with inf^my, or dyeforgotten,
Who shall oppose it. I moreover know,
That, dead, or living, I esteemed shall grow,
For what t^^y blame. That Genius tells me this,
Which never yet persuaded me amiss,
And, I believe him: Else let me become
Of all as scorned, as I am now of some.
Yea, if they ever drive me to repent,
That honest min^e with which I under-wen^
This Labor; Let the wishes of my Foes
Befall me, and let every one of those
Who either hear me named in future ages*
Or shall p^rceive, I failed in my Presages,
Be bold to say, my heart was never ri^ht,
But, that I lived and di'de an HYPOCRIT^
Your Majesty's most loyal Subject, and most humble Servant, GEO: WITHER*

A Premonition.
STay Reader, and take a few lines by way of prevention: For, though in mere
temporal en^eavo^^, I observe with Solomon, that, The race is not to the
sw^ft, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the w^se, nor riches to men
of understanding nor favo^r to men of skill, but that time and chance comes
to all; yet, I know every man is to prosecute likely means of convenient
things. And, though Ignorance wax^th so arrogant, and Art so envious, that
after much pains in some good performance, we must otherwhile take as much
more to prevent misconstructions (and think our selves well rewarded, if at
last we may escape* without a mischief^) ye^, since it is the common lot, I
will ^eare i^ p^^iently* and seek to avoid as many inconvenienc^s as I may.

It is impossible to prevent all: for* some out of mere malice practice the
disparagement of every labor whereby the glory of God may seem to be
advanced; and if on the Work they cannot fasten their Detractio^s, then they
will, to disable it, vilify the person of the Author. This was the conspiracy
of the Jews against Jeremy, (Come, (said they) let us devise devices against
him, let us smi^e him with the tongue, and let us not give beed to any of his
words.) And this way also in so violent a manner have I been persecuted, as if
my Disgrace might advance the public Honor.

Against my MOTTO, though (as I ^orespake) it redounded to their own shame, so
raged my Adversaries, that not content with my personal troubles, they sought
the disparagement of that Book, by a libellous answer the^eunto: wherein, I
was used as most writer^ of Controversies, in these days, use each other: To
wit, they objected what I never thought, and then made replies to their own
devices* which being finished, was imprinted with an inscription fal^ly
cha^ging me, with laboring to stay the publication thereof; and then also, it
was very gloriously fixed on the gate of my lodging, as if it had been some
bill of Triumph. Bu^, it proved a ridiculous Pamphlet, and became more loss
and disgrace unto the divulgers thereof, then I desired; and, non^ thought the
worse of me o^ that Book for those Invectives, save they only, whose
commendations would be more dishonor to me, then their dispraise.

Hereby, therefore, I seek not so much (...) p^even^ the like injury to my
person, as to remove those occasions of prejudice, which scandalous censures
may raise in some other, who might else, perhaps, re^eive the more profit from
this REMEMBRANCER: And what I will say to that purpose shall be very brief.

First (in regard my aim in this Poem, is chiefly God's glory, and the
welfare of this Church and Commonwealth) I desire I may no^^e traduced, though
I have here and there inserted some lighter expressions, then seem at first
view to become the gravity of the Subject: For, (considering the common vanity,
and how tedious matters of most consequence are unto some ears) it is
necessary, and by good authority warrantable, to make use of all indifferent
means, to work on humane infirmities, for our hearers profit.

Secondly, I request that wherein I differ from the vulgar Tene^s, I may not
rashly be rep^oved; but that my affirm^tions, may with all their due
circumstances, be first wei^hed: For, otherwhile the^e is just occasion to
hyperbolize. And, as he that rectifying a crooked staff, bends it somewhat on
the ^t^er side: so, in many cases, we are constrained to urge that which
appears over much on the right hand, before those who are too ^ar on the left
hand, will believe they are ought awry. Thus did the Fathers of the Church when
they had to do with some Her^tikes, and have been thereby mis understood* and
mis-censured by heedlesse Readers. In the same manner have my writings been
abused; yea, my hearers have been so hasty, that had I not explained my self
to be of their opinion, within some few lines after, doubtless they would have
robbed me of my own meaning. But, they who well heed what I affirm or deny,
will find (I hope) that I keep a midling path betwixt extremes.

If any conceive (as I hear they do) th^^ I did unwisely to remain in London
during the great M^r^ality here memorized, ^et them pe^use the third Canto, and
they shall there see* what Mot^ves and what warran^ I had for so doing. I think
it will satisfy them; for, so well it satisfied me, that (whatsoever others
may imagine) I know it had been better I should have perished in that
sickness, then to have had a heart disobedient to such motions.

If any ^axe me for inse^^ing so many Lines concerning my own thoughts and
resolu^ions; let them conside^ what use some Readers may make by application to
themselves; by having my inwa^d co^flicts for their examples; and by seeing
also what nec^ssities ^here were for me to strengt^en my self both against the
wo^ld, and against my ^wne f^^ilties, (in my hazardous undert^kings) by
expo^^ul^^ing wi^h my heart, what my conscience could say, for it self* Let
them, I say, consider what in this kind is cons^derable, and then, perhaps,
those personal relations will not seem imper^inent.

If question be made, by what authority, I took on me to write this Islands
REMEMBRANCER: in the fif^h Canto, and in some other places of this Book, they
shall find mention of my Commission; And if they be not thereby persuaded,
that I have a good Authority, it will be through their ignorance* and no ^aul^
of mine. Those Mercies and Judgments of God's which I memorize, are such as
this Kingdom is generally witness of. The Sins I reprove, are none but those
which were, and are notoriously committed: I have reprehended them in such
manner, as God's holy Word, and the universal law of Nature has warranted in
all ages. I have foretold what shall come upon such Transgressors, according to
the predictions of the Prophets. I have assured, upon Repentance, those
ble^sings which God himself has promised. I have confirmed all my own
Resolution^ by the divine Covenant, and that working of the bl^ssed Spirit,
which I have a feeling of in my own heart: And, if in these things I be
de^eived, I know not who has power to make me confident of any thing in this
life.

If any dislike my personating God (as in the first Canto) let them search, and
they shall find it usual not only in Christian Poems, but also in the holy
Text. And if we introduce him according to his A^tr^butes, and speaking
according to what in his written word he has already spoken, it may be
justified. If my personating Mercy and Justice, or my creating of other Objects
representative, or my Method, or my Phrase, or any such like, seem offensive;
my Muse ha^h apologized for her self, as much as I think need^ull, in many
places of this Book as occasion is offered, especially in the second, fi^th,
and eighth Canto's.

^f the Poem seem too l^rge, or the particulars to be over tediously insisted
upon; consider, in how many impertinent and t^ifling discourses and actions the
best of us do consume f^rre more hours the the perusal of this ^equires
minutes, and yet think it no tediousn^sse: and let them call to mind how many
huge Volumes this age imprints and reads, which are foolish, if not wicked:
let them remember also, tha^ our whole life is l^ttle enough to be employed in
the meditation of what is here recorded. Let them be persuaded likewise, that I
have not written t^is for those who have no need thereof, or to show my own
wit or compendiousn^sse, but to wa^ne and instruct the ignorant; to whom I
should more oft^n speak in vain, i^ I did not otherwhile by r^pe^itions and
circum^ocutions, stir^e up their affections, and beat into their
unders^andings, the knowled^e and feeling of those things which I deliver. Yea,
let them know, that I know those expressions will be both pleasing and
profitable to some, which* they imagine to be needless, and supe^abundant; and
that I h^d rather twenty nice Critics should censure me for a word here and
there superfluou^* then that one of those other should want that which might
explain my meanings to their capacities, and so make frustrate all my labor
to those who have most need of it, and for whom it was chiefly intended.

If you find any thing which may seem spoken ou^ of due Time; blame not me
altogether; for, it is above two years since I labored to ge^ this Book
printed; and it has cost me more money, more pains, and much more time to
publish it, then to compose it: For, I was feign to imprint every sheet thereof
with my own hand, because I could not get allowance to do it publicly: so
unwilling are we of Remembrancers in this kind.

If you find ought else that may be doubted of, or for which I may seem
reprovable, or needing advice; let me christianly and charitably receive
intell^gence thereof: And if I make not a reasonable defense, I will humbly
acknowledge and give the best satisfaction for my errors, that I am able. So, I
commit you to the blessing of God, and ^o the per^^all of this REMEMBRANCER, if
you please.

BRITTAN'S REMEMBRANCER.
Canto the first.
Our Author first with GOD begins;
Describ^s his anger for our si^nes;
Of all his Judgments mus^er makes;
Declar^s how Mercy under^akes
The pleading of this Kingdome's Ca^se,
To bring G^d's wrath unto apawse;
And (for the common ^eader) suits
High things, with lowly Attrioutes.
Then, steps into a praisefull strain
Of CHARLES his new-beginning Reign;
Empl^res that well-suc^e^d be (...),
And, for his weal (...) ^ercy pr^y.
He Iusti^e al^o, in^roduces,
Complaining on our gross abuses,
Who proves so, our si^full Nation
To merit utter Desolation,
That all Gods Plagues had ^s encl^sed,
If Mercy had not^nterposed.
But, after pleading of the case;
With Justice, Mercy does embrace,
Who (that our sins may pun^sht be)
To send the Pestilence agree;
Their other: Plagues a while suspending,
To prove how that will work amending.
ONe Storm is past, and though some cl^uds appear,
A peaceful air becalmes our Hemispheare.
That frighting Angel whose devouring blade,
Among the People such ahavock made,
Is now departed, and has took from hence
His pois'ned Arrows of the Pestilence.
God smoothes his b^ow; and lo, we no^ obtain
The cheerful brightness of hi^ ^ace again.
Oh, boundless Mercy! what a change is this*
And what a joy unto my heart (...) is!
Run quickly Mus^* to carry thy Oblation;
And, (twixt that Angel, and the Congregation)
Some swee^ perfume to our Preserver bu^ne,
Before that bloody Messenger return.
^ Let all affairs keep of^, and give thee way;
For, though my faire^t outward Fortunes lay
This hour at spoil, I would not be advised*
To speak for them, till I had sacrifis'd;
Nor will I, to the world, one line allow,
Till I have made p^^formance of my Vo^.
Most awful Power, by whom has formed ^in
The Globe of Heaven and Ear^h, and all ^herein;
Thou Alpha, and Omega of my Songs,
To whom all glory, and all fame belongs;
To thee, thrice holy and Almighty King,
Of Iu^g^ment, and of Mercy, now I sing.
Thou have unclos'd my lips, and I will raise
My thankful v^ice in setting out thy pr^ise:
Thou have pr^serv'd thy Children in the flame,
And we ascribe the glory to thy Name:
Thou saved have thy people from their crimes;
And, here, I publish unto ^uture Times,
What I have s^ene. Oh! le^ my Poem be
A sanctified Sacrifice to t^ee.
Acce^t this poor Oblation I prefer*
These drams of Incens^, and these drops of M^r^h,
(Which fired in Afflictions Flame, perfume
Thy sacred Altars) graciously assu^e*
And give my Lines a date to last as long
As there are speakers of our En^lish tongue*
That Children, yet unborne, may read the Story
Which now I sing, to thy pe^petuall glory.
And, hark ye People: harken you, I pray,
That were preserved with me to see this day;
And listen you that shall be brought upon
This Stage of action, when our Scaene is done:
Come harken all; and let no soul refrain
To hear; nor let it hear my words in vain.
For, from the ^laughter-house of Death, and ^ro^
The habitations of the Dead I come.
I am escaped from the greedy Jaws
Of Hell, and from the furious Lions paws;
With sorrows I have lodged; and I have
Experience in the horrors of the Grave;
In those discomfor^s which, by day, assail;
And those black terrors which, by night, prevail:
Despair, with her grim Furies, I have seen;
Spectator of Gods Justice I have been;
And, passing through Gods Judgments, had a sight
Of those his Mercies which are infinite:
And here, I tell the world what I observed*
For, to this purpose is my soul preserved.
That fatal Year, in which the forward ^pring
Be^ame an Autumn to our peaceful King;
When James his Crown and Scepter did forgo,
That Charles (of whom this Kingdom hops so)
Might show, when he did wear her Diadem,
How worthily we placed our hopes on him*
Yea, when within the compass of one hou^e,
Two King both had, and had not, ^gall power*
Even then, by Thames fair Banks* I did reside,
Where her swe^t waters washes every Tide
The spacious verge of that well peopled Town,
Which with most princely Palaces does crown
Her goodly stream, and at her Ports and Keys,
Take in the wealth of Kingdoms and of Seas.
Our sovereign City, then I did epsy
Upon the couch of soft security;
And, how with Peace and Plenty being fed,
She toyed like a wanton, on her bed.
I saw her dressed in all that rich attire,
Which does inflame her Lovers with desire;
And how her idle Children, every day,
Sat down to eat, and drink, and rose to play.
For, she was grown insensible of cares;
She had almost forgot^en, sighs, and tears;
And all this Island in her cup of Pleasure,
With her had quaf^ed (so much out of measure)
Till they gr^w drunk together through excess,
And wild and giddy in their drunkenness*
They h^d almost forgotten him, from whom
Their ease and their prosperity d^d come.
They spent their hours in laughter and in song,
And grew regardlesse of the poor man's wrong.
They always clothed went in soft array;
They fed themselves with dainties, day by day;
And, that no outward meane^ of pleasure might
Be wanting to accomplish their delight,
Those iollities, wherein they did appear,
Were furthered by the season of the year.
The winds then breathed on them wholesome air
The G^oves, their su^^er clothings did repair;
The frui^full F^eld^ wit^ f^esh gr^ene gowns were clad,
Which Flor^ curiou^ly embroydered had:
The pleasant G^rdens their choice plaints displaid,
(...) Orch^rd with gay blossoms wore arraid;
The winged Choristers did sweetly sing,
And with choice Music welcome in the Spring:
Their streets with m^^chlesse bravery did shine;
Their Parlers many beauties did enshrine*
Their costly Bowres with rarities were hung,
And always filled with a merry throng*
Of naught but sports and triumphs were their dreams
Wealth, health and honor, were their studied theam^s
No noisome Plagues, within their Gates were found,
Of Groans, their dwellings did but rarely sound*
Nor was there ^^y storm or danger feared:
For, in this Hemisphere so bright appeared
New CHARLES his waine, that sunlike he did chase
All fogs of coffeehouse from each place,
And, all those clouds of grief, expelled far,
Which rose at settin^ of our JACOB Star.
But, oh how ^^^stlesse are those lying shows
Of happiness, on which most men repose
Their greatest confidence? And from our fight
How swiftl^ did these pleasures take their flight*
For, whether he, who from his heavenly sphere
Beholde^h all our though^s and actions here,
Did with a searching ey^, examine more
Our cours^^ at that present then before:
Or, whether he our carelessness had cyde,
Or our hypocrisy, or else our pride,
O^ our impiety; or wh^th^r he
Did in this Island, or this Kingdom see
Our old Idolatr^es come creeping in;
Or, whether he some new devised sin
Descride to sprout among us here; yea, whether
It were some one of these, or all together,
Or what it was, I know not: But it proved.
A crying s^^ne; and so extremely moov'd*
God's gentleness^ that angry he became;
His brows were bended, and his eyes did flame.
Me thought ^ saw it so: and (though I were
Afraid within his presence to appear)
My Soul was raised above her common station;
Where what en^ues I viewed be Contemplation.
There is ^ spacious Round which bravely reares
Her Arch above the top of all the Spheres,
Until her bright Circumference does rise
Above the r^ach of Man's, or Angels eyes;
Conveying through the Bodies christalline
Those Rays which on our lower Globe do shine,
And, all the great and lesser Orbs, do lie
Within the compass of that Canopy.
In this large Room of State is fixed a Throne,
From whence the wise Creator looks upon
His workmanship; and thence does hear and see,
All sounds, all pl^^es, and all things that be.
Here sat the King of Gods; and from about
His eyelids, so much terror sparkled out,
That every circle of the Heavens it shook,
And all the World did ^remble at his look;
The prospect of the Sky, that erst was clear,
Did with a low^ing countenance appear:
The troubled Air, before his presence ^led;
The Earth into her bosom ^hrunk her head;
The Dee^s did ro^re; the Heights did stand amazed;
The Moon an^ Stars upon each other gazed;
The Sun did stand unmoved in his path;
The Host of Heaven was frig^t^d at his wrath;
And with a voice which made all Creatures quake,
To this effect, the great ETERNAL spoke.
Are we a GOD? and is there power in us
Ta s^artle all our whole Creati^n thus?
And yet, are we despised, as if these Powers
Were either lesser grown, or none of ours?
Are we, that with our ^entles^ breath can blow
All things to nothing, still abused so?
Has our long suffering hardened so our Foes,
That now our Godhead into question growe^?
N^y (which is worse) have we compassion shown,
Till we are quite neglected of our own?
Is this the Land whom we have loved so long,
And, in our love, elected from among
The Heathen Isles (and at the first was burl'd
Into the utmo^t corner of the world)
That we might raise the glory of her name,
To equal King domes of the greatest fame?
Is this that Island, which our love did place
(Within our bosom) in the safe embrace
Of great Oceanus? and, garden like
Did whar^e about (within her watery Dike)
With mighty Rocks, and Cliffes, whose tops were higher,
Then any foming Billow da^es aspire?
Is this the Kingdom, which our band h^th made
The School and Shop, of every Art, and Trad^?
The Cornucopia of all needful plenties?
The Storehouse, and the Closset of our dainties?
Our Jewel house, and Palace royal, where
The fairest of our Loves maintained are?
Is this the Cou^t^y which our bounty served
With store of bread, when many Lands were starved?
And whom we have pres^rved from the spoils
Of Foes abroad, and from domesticke b^oyles?
Are theirs the Cities, which do wear the Flag
Of Peace, while Rochel, Heidleb^rg, and Prague,
And ^ll the Christian world engaged are,
In some offensive, or defensive war?
Are their's the Cities, to whose fleets were shown,
The pathlesse ways through many seas unknown?
Whose wealthy Merchants have encreast their trade
From every Port and Creek, that we have made?
Whose vessel^ have, by our protection, gone
Past both the Tropicks, and through every Zone,
And made their petty Villages, become
Acquainted with more worlds, then ancient Rome?
Is this that people unto whom we gave,
More lovely Bodies, then most Nations have?
And in whose minds (of our especial grace)
We did the best ^pproved temper place?
Is this that People, whom we did restore
To humane shape, when as the sca^let-whore
Had with her charmed Cup of poisned wine,
Tran^form'd them into Asses, A^es and swine?
Did we in pers^cution hear their cries?
T^ke off, the s^^les of blindness from t^eir eyes*
Win^ke at their follies, when they most offended?
Forbear the punishments that were intende^?
From diverse Plagues inflicted them release?
Make Europe stand and wonder at their peace?
Yea* save them from the malice of their Foe,
When all were like to perish at a blow?
And, grace and fav^ur undeserved show,
When they their own dest^^ction did purs^e?
H^ve we, these threesc^re years and upwards b^est
Their Kingdoms from those troubles that i^fest
Most other States? And (when their souls had been
Nigh famisht else) did we provide a Queen,
(A maiden Queen; with virtues masculine)
To nurse them up in holy Discipline?
Did we provide, when she her course had ^un,
A King who favored, what her hand begun?
And now another, who does both re^tore
Those hopes they lost in him, and promise more?
Did we but here, of late, when they had lost
Their Prince (that now is King) when they almos^
Despaired of his return, for evermore,
When he remained on the Iberian shore?
Did we a^cept their vows? observe their tears?
Com^assionate their jealousies and fears?
And send their Darling home, when few did know
Whereon to build a hope it should be so?
Yea, when throughout the world no other power,
Could such a work have compassed but our?
H^ve we endured their frowardness so long?
Forgiven and forgotten so much wrong?
Sought after them, when they ^ad us forsaken?
So of^, their counte^feit Repentance taken?
So many times appa^an^ made unto them,
Wha^ mischiefs their own ^oolish projects do them?
Yea, did we freely* sundry blessings daigne
Vnaskt, which other Lands could not obtain
By labors, vows, and prayers? And have they thus,
For all those benefits requited us?
Is that their vowed thankfulness? Are these
The fruits of all their zealous promises?
Is this their Piety? Go, draw together
Thy Forces, Vengeance: quickly march them th^^her,
With all our Armies; and consume them so,
That we man never more displeased grow
At their unkindnesse; or be cheated by
The fained weepings of Hypocrisy.
No sooner had he spoken, but, behold,
An Host (which he does always keep enrold,
To execute his wrath) did straight appear*
And in his awful pres^nce mustred were.
So many Troops, did ^ound about him throng,
That, all the wo^ld with Plagues, was ove^hung:
For not a Judgment is there, which has name,
But, thither to attend his Will it came.
Stern visag'd WAR (whose very look does strike)
Came driving on his Charret, Iehu like;
Armed and beset with holberts, bills, and glaves,
Bows, a^rowes, pikes pole axes, darting staves,
Guns, balls of fire, and every thing that furthers
The work of Desolation, Wounds, and Murders.
His prime c^mpanions, The^t and Rapine were,
With all those Vices which most c^uell are.
And at their heels pursu^d all those Bands
Of raging mischiefs, that afflict the Lands
On which he falls. This is that roaring Fiend
Who Laws, and Leagues, does into pieces rend.
This is that bloody Tyrant, who o're-turnes
The goodl'est Monument^, and spoils and b^rnes
The fairest Dwellings. This, is he that raze^
Renowned Cities, and the strongest places.
This is that sacrilegious Thief, who spares
Nor Hospital nor Temple* neither hears
The ^uits or cries of ^ged or of young;
Nor is regardfull of men we^ke or ^trong.
The Suckling from his Mo^hers breast be snatcheth
And brains it in her sight: The Wife he c^tcheth
Even from her Husbands bed* and Virgins from
Their Lovers arms, his Strumpets to become.
A sertile Soil he makes a Wilderness,
And Wolves, and Bears, and Foxes, to possess
Those places, wherein Arts did once abound;
And where have dwelled Nations most ^enown'd*
However, he is an instrument of God's;
And usually, the l^st of all those rod^
Which on a thankless^ Kingdom he does lay,
Before he finally remove away
The mean^s of Grace. Next him, came sneaking in
Lean Famine, with ^are bones, and pa^ched skin;
With deep sunk eyes, with talons over-growne;
With hungry teeth that would have cracked a s^one;
And, close behind her, and at either hand,
Such Troops did wait, as are at her command.
The crawling Caterpill^rs, wa^^full Flye^,
The skipping Locust (that in winter dies)
Floods, Frosts, and Mi^^ewes, Blastings, Winds, and Storme^,
Drough, ravenous Fowls, and Vermin, Weeds, and Worme^*
Sloth, Evil busdandry, and such as those,
Which make a Scarceness where most plenty grows.
This is that hungry Houswife, who first found
The searching out for meat from under ground;
To dig up Roots; to relish, well, the taft
Of stin^ing Garlic, and of bitter Mast.
She taught poor people ^ow to fill their mawes,
With Bramble-berries, Hedge-picks, Hips, and Hawes*
It Was she who finding on the sandy shore
A ^eape of Oisters (all bedaubed over)
First sought within those dirty shells for meat,
Else we had never dared of them to eat;
Nor thought, nor hoped, that so foul a dish
Could bring to table such a dainty fish.
Twa^ she that learned the Spaniards how to dre^^e
Their Frogs; the Frenchman how to cook a me^se
Of ^pu^^y Mushromes; Germans how to make
A dinner or a ^upper on a Snake;
Italians on the slimy Snaile to feed;
Our Irishme^ to live upon a weed
That grows in Marshes. And I dare to say,
That, but for her, we scarce had heard this day
Of Cavear, and twenty such like bables,
Which Gluttony now sets upon our Tables.
The broyling of old shoes, was her device;
And so was eating Carrion, Rats, and Mice.
Those dainty pallats which could relish no^ght
But what was fet far off, and dearly bought,
She so has d^^^ed, that they could feed
On moldy scraps; and beg them too for need.
This Hag, has Towns and Cities famished.
With humane flesh, she hungry men has ^ed:
She fo^c't them has to suck their horses blood:
To feed on Pigeons dung (in stead of food)
And dearly purchase it. Yea, some constrained
To drink their Urine, when they drought sustained.
Nay, this is that un^quall'd cruell-one,
Who urged a Mother, once, to kill her Son,
And make unnaturally that cursed womb
Which gave him being, to be made his tomb.
Even this is She, God shield us from her cheer,
And g^ant her Plagueship never settle here.
The Pestilence, moreover, thither brought
Her feared forces, and employment sought.
This is that Nimble Fury, wh^ did stay
Her three and twenty thousand in one day;
And in the Assirian Camp, to death did smite,
Almost two hundred thousand in one night.
Betwixt an evening and a morning-tide,
From every house a soul she did divide
Throughout the Land of Egypt; and could mark
Their eldest-borne, although the nigh^ were dar^.
In little space, she quite has overthrown^
Great Cities, and dispeopled many a Town.
She from each other makes acqua^ntance run,
Before that any injuries be done;
And of the po^s'ning- Art has found the height,
For, she know^s how to poison by conceit.
A Mantle wrought with purple spots she wore,
Embost wi^h many a Blaine, and many a Sore.
She had a raving Voice, a frantic Lock,
A noys^me Breath, and in her hand she shook
A venomed spear, which, where it touches, fills
The veins with poison, and distracts, and kills.
Within her Regiment are all Diseases,
And every Torment which the Body seizes;
Go^ts, Collicks, Lethargies, and Apo^lexies,
Obstruction, which the spleen, or stomach v^xe^;
The ^ox of every kind, ^heumes, aches, Stiches,
Quick-killing Pleurisies, and Scabs, and Itches;
The Burning-Fever, who deserves well
The place of her Lieutenant-Colonell;
Consumptions, Gangreeves, Coughes, and Squina^cie^,
The Falling-evill, Cramps, and Lunacies,
(With other such Diseases, many more
Then I am able by their names to know)
Besides those maladies the Sea procures,
As, sloath-bred Scurvies, and mad Calentures;
And all those other Griefs, and Sorrows, which
Those Sicknesses do bring on poor and rich.
But, of that Host which here is mentioned,
The maine Battalion was both ranged and led
By that slye Prince, (even that malicious one)
Which in the ayrie Region has his throne.
To fu^ther his designs, he brought in Lies,
Extortion, Bribing, Fraud, and Perjuries;
With many thousand stratagems beside,
Whose dangerous effects are often tried.
All ravenous Beasts, (or rather those of whom
Such Beasts are Emblemes) in his troops did come:
To work his mis^hiefes (with amaze and wonder)
He furnished was ^ith Lightnings, Winds, and Thunder;
Prodigious apparitions, and those sights
Wherewith men's troubled fancies he affrights;
And, thither did (for soule-assaults) ^epaire
His two black Twins, Pr^sumpt^on and Despair.
Attended by those manifold Temptations,
Wherewith he makes sure the reprobations
Of all obdurate finners; whom in wrath
Our God, deservedly rej^cted has.
These greedy Spoilers, hungry for a prey,
Stood ready, Gods commandings to obey:
Who having viewed their well prepared Bands,
(And pointing out his finger to these Lands)
Said; Go ye Plagues. And (had he not been staid)
Lay waste, that sinful Realm, he would have said.
And yet, it seems, these dreadful shows were rather
The threatenings of a wise and loving Father,
(To bring his Children to a filial fear)
Then such a wrath as does in Fo^s appear.
For, neither Chance, nor Time, no^ New-desert,
Was interposed on the guilty part:
But, God's own good^ess^ brought the means about
That stopped our Doom, before his words were out.
And thus it was. The great Almighty One
Has evermore attending on his th^one
Two royal Daughters. One of t^em is she
That Is called Justice; and her Emblemes be
An equal Balance, and a flaming Blade,
To weigh the Good their due, and fright the ^ad:
And, both with hand and eye she threatens those,
That her uprightness, any way oppose.
The other for her Hierogliphick wears
A Box of Balm, and in her bosom beare^
A sucking Lamb, (which meek and ha^mles creature
Does somewhat intimate her gen^le nat^re)
Betwixt her beauteous breasts, a true Compassion
Erecteth her perpetual habitation;
And, such a lovely sweet aspect has she,
That's if Wrath saw her, Wrath in love would be.
We call her Clemency. She often makes
Our peace with God, and his displeasure slakes.
This Princess, ma^king well with what intent
Her Lord would those great Armies forth have sent;
And finding, by that wrath she saw in him,
What Desol^tions would have followed them;
With tears of pity, to his throne she ran,
To kiss and to embrace hi^ feet began;
And (whilst his halfe-spoke sen^ence God delaid)
These words, the faire-well spoken Virgin said.
Dear, ^h dear Father! wherefore frownst thou s^?
What fearful thing art thou about to do?
Hold (I beseech thee hold) thou back the doom,
Which from thy lips is now about to come;
And bear (Dread Sovereign) hear thy Handmaid speak
A word or two, before thy Justice wreake
Deserv^d vengeance on that wretched place
Which has so fallen from thy wonted Grace.
Loo^ Father* look upon me: it is I,
Thy best-beloved Daughter CLEMENCY*
It Is I whom thou forget^est. I am she
Who in thy bosom lay, beloved of thee
Before all worlds; and had a sov'raignty
Over all thy creatures from eternity.
It Is I, at whose entreaty thou were moved
To send thine only Son, thy best-beloved
(For Man's redemption) to assume the nature,
The form, and frailties, of a finfull creature.
It Is I that have presu^ed to become
A suitor now, to stay thy heavy d^ome:
And, why should I be doubtful to make trial
Of thy regard, or fearful of denial?
In Judgment, thou have promised, oh Lord!
To think on Me (even in thy w^itten word)
Yea, Heaven and E^rth have often heard thee say,
Thou nev^r woul^^t, for ever, cast away
Thy Loving-Mercy; and, I k^ow, thou mus^
And wilt, be found in all thy sayings, just.
But, then, to what intents, do These appear?
Why are thy dreadful Armies mustred he^e?
What fav^ur is it possible to show,
Where such a Rablement as this, shall go?
Why may not Pit^e show her self as well
Within the bottom of the low^st Hell
As where these revell? Doubtless, these rude Bands
Will spare nor Laws nor Temples in those Lands
To which thou send them shall; but, from each plac^
Root out (with ev'^y present means of Grace)
All outward helps of present knowing thee,
If equal to their hate, their power may be.
And, what if then their breathless fury shall
Leave some few trifles which are temporal?
For what will they reserve them, but to breed
A race of Infidels? a wicked seed,
For them to prey upon? a Brood, to whom
The Blessings left Damnation shall become.
Thou have upon that Island (I confess)
Bestowed Favors, great and numberless.
I know that they may justly blush for shame,
To hear how grossly they abuse thy Name;
Yea, they now are, and have a long time bin,
Grown out of measure sinful in their sin.
Yet, if thou look upon them, thou shall see
Some there, who bend not unto ^aal their knee;
Some left, who for thine honor sirme have ^^ood;
Some, who have garments washed in the blood
Of thy unspotted Lamb: and some, which bear
Those marks, that Seals of thy free pardon are.
Oh! let not them enclosed with Sinners be,
Nor swallowed up with such who know not thee.
But, for the sakes o^ those forb^are thou, rath^r,
The Tares, until thy Harvest thou shall gather:
So, by those Follies which in them abound,
Thy Goodness shall the farther be renowned.
If, therefore, thou this Kingdom should not spare,
Because, repleat with sin her dwellings are,
What Nation is there, or what Habitation,
That merits not perpetual reprobation?
Where wilt t^ou find a People, under Heaven,
Which has not every way occasion given
Of thy displeasure? Or, what Man is there
That in thy sight could justifi^d appear,
If thou should mark him with a frowning eye?
And, what a pretty Nothing, then were I,
If no man lived, that amiss had done,
For me, to exercise my pity on?
Nay, if Transg^ession had but finite been,
How should thy Mercies infinite. be seen?
Though on this Field (which thou have plowed and sown
With purest Wheat) some wicked-ones have thrown
Their Tares, by night; yet, somewhat it has borne
For which it may be ^ald thy Field of Corn.
Thy Fence is yet about it; and there stands
A Fort, and Wine Press, builded by thy hands.
There are thy Sacraments, thy Word divine,
There, is the School of Christian Discipline.
There, may the me^nes of Grace be kept in s^ore
For those who will hereaf^er prise them more.
Thy poo^e ^fflicted Servants* thither may
From foreign persecutions fly away;
^^d sheltred in a Storm, there s^f^ly tarry,
As in a Fortress, or a ^anctuary.
But, whither shall they fly when that lies wast?
Where shall thy sacred Oracles be placed?
Or whither with her Son that Woman go,
Who by the Dragon is pursued so?
I know that if thou please thou can provid^
A place for her, securely to abide,
Amid the Western wilderness^ (and where
Scarce glimmerings of thy favo^rs yet appear)
By moulding out the Heathen Salvages
To be a people far surpassing these.
This, Lord, thou could effect* and make of them
Thy people, whom these most of all contemn.
And, since this Nation, in their weal^^y peace,
Have sent out Colonies, but to en^rease
Their private gain: since they fair show^s have made
Of publishing thy Gospel* when the Trade
For cursed lucre (as the Times reveal)
Was chiefest founder of their fained zeal:
Since they in that, and other things, pretend
Religion, when it is farthest from their end:
Thou did but right, if thou should force their se^d
To set^le on some barbarous Coast for reed;
And, there, thy Truth, to those, with sorrow preach,
Whom they neglected, in their weal, to teach.
But, since it were no more for thee to do,
This Land to save, and call another too,
Then one such work so compass; why I pray
Should thou remove their Candlestick away?
Why may not Thou, who all compassion art,
Thy people, rather, by thy power convert,
Then quite destroy them? wherefore should thou no^
Their errors forth ^f thy remembrance blot,
As heretofore? And always praised be
For that abundant Love, which is in thee?
Why should their Foes and thine, with jeering say,
Now, ^ow we see our long-expected Day*
Why w^lt thou give them cause to domineere?
Even those, who love not thee, to laugh, and fleere
A^ their destruction, who, thy Truth professed,
(If not u^fainedly) in show, at least.
Though they have ill-deserv'd, why should the shame
Of their off^nces fall upon thy Name?
And, thy Blasphemers (by thy Peoples fall)
Assume the ^oldnesse on themselves, to call
Thy Gospel into question? Or, thereby,
T^ei^ shameless falsehoods seek to justify?
Why should the wicked, take occasion from
Th^se ^lagues, to say* Where is their God become?
Where is their power, on which they did r^pose?
Where is their ^aith? where are the hopes of those
Their s^rvices? Oh! for thine own dear sake,
(However they des^rve) compassion take.
Dear SIR, have pity: and, as often, thou
Have granted my request, vouchsafe it now.
Yea, to those many thousands, heretofore,
From thy abundance, add one favor more*
By these, and other Motives (breathed from
A zealous breast) the heavens are overcome.
His love of us, does so our Sampson wound,
That, he has taught us, how he may be bound.
Yea, Holy-writ informs us, that He,
By such like Charmings, will compelled be.
And, now they so prevailed, that the rage
Of our great God, they partly did aswage.
Which, MERRY by his look, had quickly heeded;
And taking that a^vantage, thus proceeded,
Oh! what a comfort is it, to behold*
Thine Eye speak Mercy, and thy Brow unfold
A reconcilement! Now, I seem to see
Thy gracious face, to shine again on me.
I find it is the jealousy of Love,
(And no effect of hatred) which does mov^
Thy wronged Patience: and, that when thou hides^
Thy presence in an angry Cloud, or chidest,
It (...) not always in consuming wrath,
(^o punish, as the faul^ deserved has)
But, that thy frighting Judgments might prevail,
To work a^endment, when thy Love does fail.
That People whom so much thou did aff^ct,
How can tho^ have a purpose to reject,
So long as in their Co^fines does remain
That Number, which thy Vengeance does restrain?
Who can believe that thou defra^a'st such cost,
To purchase what, thou meanest shall be lost?
Or, labor to erect them, did bestow,
For nothing else, but them away ^o throw?
Why should I think, thy endless* goodness, had
So little care, to save what thou have made,
That Satan's Hate, should for their Desolation,
Out-worke thy Love, in working their Salvation?
Or, that the boundlesnesse of M^ns transgression,
Could over-match thine Infini^e Compassion?
It may not be believed; Or, that this
Pre^ended war, for final ruin is.
Since, if in summoning thy Iudgement^, now,
Thou had proposed their u^ter overthrow,
Thou would not have discovered an assection,
^y still co^tinu^ng them, in thy prote^tion,
As yet thou do: Nor ^a^ly s^nd unto them
Love Tokens, (as if kindness, thou would do them
Which they should never know of) nor, make show
Os having ^eft them, when it is nothing so
Thus have I seen, on earth, a Lover use
His Best-beloved, when she did abuse
His true affection. Though he seem unkind^,
That her unkindnesse she may thereby find^;
Yea, though he feign some outward disrespec^^,
Yet, in his heart, so truly he affects,
That, whats^ever good, he can, he does her:
By means unscene, to her lost virtues, wo^es her:
For her well-doing, takes a thousand cares:
Of her ill-doing, has ten thousand seares:
Wakes not, but thoughts of her, in waking, keeps;
Sleeps not, but dreameth of her, when he sleep^s.
Not ceasing to end^avour, (...) he see
Some sparks of lost affection kindled be.
And, as her over sights she does deplore,
So, he his love discovers, more and more;
Until the fire, that was a long tim^ bid,
Break forth, and flame as high as e're it did.
I never knew thee, yet, to rui^ate
A wicked Kingdom^, or a sinful State,
Professing thee; but, thou did first withdr^w
From those Offenders, thy abused Law.
And, as in Christian Realms, the temp'rall Sword
Cuts off no Preacher of thy blessed Word,
(For any Crime committed) until he
Of Holy-orders, first degraded be:
So, thou (most frequently) do first remove
The Scales of Grace, and Pledges of thy Love,
Before thou give up Lands into their power,
W^o them, and theirs, shall finally devour:
For, till thy holy things, be fetched from
Their Coast, such Desolation shall not come.
Those, they retain. And, if conclude I shall
From hope of any blessing temporal,
That yet thou love them (and do intend
Their Land, with future favors, to befriend)
That King which thou have now on them bestowne,
Some token of thy Clemency has shown.
For, if man may by good external signs,
Conjecture whereunto his heart enclines:
If Thou, to whom all secrets open be,
See that in him, which mortals hope they see;
And have not mocked that People, sor their sin,
With shows of things that have not real bin:
(As Lord forbid) No Kingdom has a Prince,
Whose infant years, gave ^etter ^vidence,
that with an earthly Crown he should inherit,
A plentious portion of thy sacred Spirit.
None lives now, on whom the general eye
Did so much gaze, and so few scapes espy.
F^w private men were in their youth so fr^e
From all those vanities, which frequent be
In these rude times (he having means to do
His pleasure, and, perhaps, s^rong temptings too)
Who seemed of those knowledges, more feign
That might inform him, to obey, and reign?
How well those crossings was he thought to bear,
Which in the times of his subjection were?
And, with how brave a temper to neglect,
To be avenged of wrongs and disrespect?
that Son, did in his Fathers life time, show
^ ^iliall fear and love, united so?
Or, which of all thy Vice-royes d^dst thou see
App^are more zealously devout then ^e?
Thou know which: But, if they do not err
Who, things by probability, infer,
It might be said, The world had not his peer
In all those virtues, that are mentioned here.
And should conf^ssed be, even of his so,
They had not flattred who affi^med so:
Since, what was of his worth, at home conceiv^d,
All Europe for a verity received.
And lo^; now by thy Grace he sits on
The seat of Rule, and in his Fathers Th^one;
Who gives signs of truer love to thee?
Or of more conscience, of his Charge, the^ He?
What Monarke, in appearance, better preache^h
By good Examples, what thy Precepts teaches?
Or which of all his reverend Prelacy,
In shows of true religious constancy,
Outgoes or equals him? Oh! if so clear
His virtues prove* as yet they do appear,
How glorious will they grow? And, what a light
Will he become, when he ascends the height
Of his great Orb? And, oh! what pity 'twere
His mind should ever fall below that sphere
Of Grace which he has climbed! or, that thy Love
Should wanting be, to keep him still above!
How grievous would it be, that his beginning
(So hopeful, and such l^ve and honor winning)
Should fail that expectation, which it has?
And, make thee shut thy favor up, in wrath?
Let not oh God! let not the sins of others
Nor any fog (which Virtues glory smothers)
Ascending from his frailties, make obscure
His rising honor, which yet seems pure.
If might, in him, be w^nting of that worth
Which to the public view is blaz^d sorth,
Forgive, and perfect him, that he may grow,
To be in deed, what he appears in show.
Yea, Lord (as far as humane frailty can
Permit the sa^e) make him, even such a Man
As now that Kingdom needs; and spare that Nation
For him, which else deserves Desolation.
(...) If he be what he seems; Thou (I know)
^ilt save his Land from utter overthrow.
Thou, in the lifetime of a p^ous King,
Were never yet, accustomed to bring
Destruction: For, thou shewedst him compassion,
Who did but once, well act humiliation;
^v'n wicked Ahab; and within his Times
Thou would not pun^sh (no no^) his own Crimes.
Oh! be as merciful, as thou have bin;
And let this King* thy favors triumph in.
^et that exceeding Grace already showed him,
(Even that wherewith thy Spirit has indu'd him)
Be Pledges of some greater Gifts, with which
Thou shall in future times, his heart enrich.
His br^st inflame thou, with a sacred fire;
Teach him to ask, and give him his desire:
Grant him thy Wisdom, and thy Righteousness,
The wrongs of all his People to redress.
Let him the Widow, and the Orphane save,
Releeving all, that need of succor have:
And, let his Mountains, and each lesser Hill,
Hi^ humbler Dales, with peace, and plenty fill.
As he was honored in his Preservation,
So, let him glory still in thy Salvation.
As he persisteth to rely on thee;
So, let him sure of thy protection be.
Be thou his only joy. Be thou I pray
His Triumph on his Coronation-^ay.
Crown thou his head with purified gold:
Make st^ong his Scepter, and his Throne uphold,
To be renowned by thy Grace divine,
As long as either Sun, or Moon shall shine.
Since thou to rule thine Isr^el do appoint him,
Let thy most holy Spirit, Lord, anoint him.
Make thou a league with him, as thou have done
With David, and adopt him for thy Sonn^.
To thee, Thou art my Father, let him say,
My God, my Rock of safety, and my stay.
Throghout those Lands, where thou to reign shall place him
With Title, of thy First-begotten, grace him.
And, let his Kingdoms harbor none of them,
Who shall deny him to be their Supreme.
So guard, and so enclose him with thine Arm,
The Man of Sin; may nev^r do him harm.
To him, his Adversaries all subject,
And, prosper none that him shall disaffect.
Lead thou his Armies, when his War begins;
Make thou his Peace, when he the Battle winnes.
Let still thy Truth, and Love, with him abide;
Let in thy Name, his name be glorified.
Do thou the Seas into his power d^liver;
Make thou his right hand reach beyond the River;
And, plant so strongly on the Banks of Rhyne,
Those fruitful Branches of his Fathers Vine,
(Whom late the salvage Bore (with tripled power)
Has rooted up, with purpose to devour)
That they may spread their Clusters, far and nigh;
And fill, and top, the Germane Empery.
Yea, mind thou, Lord, the scorn^s and de^amations,
Which they have borne among their neighboring nations*
And, please to comfort them, and make them glad,
According to the sorrows they have had.
To them, so sanctify their great affliction,
That it may bring their virtues to perfection;
And, fit them for some place, in which they shall
Help rear again, decaying Sions wall.
Oh! keep for them, a favor still in store;
Preserve them in thy League, for evermore;
Bless thou that Race, which is or shall be given:
As lasting make it, as the day^s of heaven:
And, if thy Laws or Judgments, they forsake,
Or, if thy League, or Covenant, they break,
With Rods, let them, in mercy, be corrected;
But, never fall, for aye, to be rejected.
The like for this new Monark, I emplore:
In him, increase thy Graces, more, and more.
Make ^im a Blessing, for all Christendom:
Make him, a Pattern, for all Times to come:
Make him, in every happy course persever;
And, let him live, for ever and for ever.
His Royal Robe, he has but new put on;
And, I my prayers have but new begun.
Oh let me to thy Majesty prefer
These few Petitions, in particular:
And place them where, they may both day and night,
Stand, evermore, unfolded in thy sight.
First, teach him, to consider, how and why,
T^ou have enthroned him on a seat so high*
And, so to think on his great charge; and trust,
As one who knows he come to reckning m^st:
For, honors if by thee they be not blessed,
Make wisest men as brutish as a beast.
Teach him to mind, how great the favor wa^,
When thou, of thy mere motion, and thy Grace,
Did from so many millions choose out him,
To wear this Kingdoms fourefold Diadem:
And, make thy Servants, favored in his sight*
As thou have made of him, thy Favorite.
Teach him, the fittest means to take away
(And let none murmr at his just delay)
Those Groves, and those Hill-Altars in the Land,
Which suffered are unt^ll his days to stand:
And, give him wisdom, wisely to foresee,
That Wheat from Chafe, may well distinguished be.
For, some will, else, bring Truth into suspicion,
Condemn good Discipline, for Superstition;
And with fair shows, of Piety, beguile,
That underhand they may encroach, the while,
On Gods Inheritance; and from her tear
Those outward Ornam^nts his Bride does wear.
Oh! let him purge from Church and Commonweal,
Those inflammations of corrupted zeal,
And indigested humors, which do spread
Distempers through the Stomach; pain the Head:
And, by prepost'rous courses, raise a storm
To rend that Body, which it would reform.
Let him, his Reformations, first begin,
Like David, with himself: and search within
The closset of his heart, what he can find,
Which may annoy him there, in any kind:
And let him thence expel it, though it were,
As dear unto him as his eye-bals are.
His Household, let him next enquire into,
And, well informed be, what there they do*
That, so he may expect thy Comming-day
With heart upright, and in a perfect way.
Let him in no profaneness take del^ght,
Nor brook a wicked person in his sight.
^e^ no Blasphemer in his presence tarry;
Nor they that falsehoods, to and fro, do carry.
Let him acquai^tance with all such refrain^;
The lowly cherish; h^ughty minds restrain^;
Enquire for them that vertuou^ly excel,
And take in honest men with him to dwell.
No such Projector, who does put in use
Great Injuries, to mend a small abuse;
Nor such, who in reforming, do no other
B^t rob one Knave, to help enrich another;
And prove themselves, when trial does befall,
To be, perhaps, the veriest K^aves of all.
Let him be cursed with no base Officer,
Who does before true Honor, Gold prefer;
And, ^o enrich his Ches^, a little more,
Would in his Reputation, make him poor:
Or with some needless Treasure, to supply him,
Lose him more Love, then all his Lands can buy him.
Let no man of his daily bread partake,
Who at thy holy Board shall him forsake;
And, lay thou open their dissimul^tion,
Who shall approve of Na^mans Tol^ration.
K^epe from his Counsels, though their wit excels,
All Hypocrites, and all Achitophels.
Yea, let thy Wisdom, hi^ discretion bless,
From Rehoboams childish wilfulness,
Who lef^ his ancient Princes good directions,
^o follow his young Nobles raw projections.
Or, if ^e like their Counsels, and receive them,
Harm let them bring to none but those wh^ gave them:
And, if to him some damage they procure,
Let present loss his future peace procure.
Make him perceive that humane Policy
(...) H^nd m^id to rel^^ious H^ne^ty;
And that, the man who does foundation^ lay
On Justice, (and proves constant in his w^y)
Shall mad the Politician; and ^ake vain
His underminings without fear^, or pain.
For, as a Fowler seldom does su^prise
That wary Bird, which can her self suffice,
With what thy ^and provideth in the fi^lds,
Or, what the ^orrest, for her die^ yields:
So, sl^ights of Policy (although, perchance,
They seem, a while, to work some hinderance)
Can disadvantage no^e, but those, who leaving
The paths of Virtue, and themselves deceiving
With some false hopes (which were before them laid)
Made them the means, whereby they were betrayed.
Make him as precious in his Peoples eyes
As their own blood. Far higher let them prise
His honor then their fortunes; and let him,
Be every way as tender over them.
Yea, let the mutual love, betwixt them bred,
Unite them as the Body, and the Head.
^or, such a blessed Union does procure
More saf^ty then four Kingdoms can assure;
Commands men's hearts, their fortunes, and their lives,
Is chief of all his chief Pre^ogatives;
And shall more comfort, and more profit do him,
Then all those frui^lesse claims can bring unto him;
Whereto, perchance, they urge him will, who shall
Pretend his honor, when they seek his fall.
Such men in Princes Courts were ^ver found,
But, thou their l^wd Projections wilt confound;
And, when their vain devise b^ing on them,
Confusion, w^o thi^ r^all Truth contemn;
When such men's fool^sh counsels, shall have brought
Th^se mischiefs o^ them which their hands have wrou^^^
(Yea, when oppressed, with fears and discontent,
They shall, too late, perhaps, their course repent)
Then, they in heart shall forced be to say,
That, what they slighted was the safest way.
Bless him from those, who censure his Intents,
His Counsel^, or his Actions by events:
An^ saw^ily, his Judges dare appear
On every sla^d'rous Rumor they shall hea^e.
Preserve him from those Minions (who do raise
Their credits by another man's dispraise)
That Machivillian crew, who to endeare
Their base immerits, fill the royal ear
With tales, and false reports, concerning those
Who their misdoings legally oppose:
They, who gr^wne great with rapine, and made strong,
With w^alth extorted to the public wrong,
Still add (to cover what misdone has bin)
New w^ongs; and make new partners in their sin,
In hope their number ^eep them shall unshent:
And, silence and condemn the Innocent.
Make him ab^or such Apes, and such Baboones,
As Parasi^es, and impudent Buffoone^:
Such, as would make their Princes glad with lies:
Such, as with filthy tales of ribaldries,
With ^curvile songs, with unbese^ming j^sts,
And stuff which every civil ^are detests,
Abuse Kings Chambers. Let all those who buy
Their Offices (which is lay Simony)
H^ve always his dislike; and not recover
His good esteem again, till they give ove^
Their evil gotten places. Let all such
Who for the seats o^ Judgment, do as much,
A^peare to him as men who are detected
Of (...) crimes; and ever be suspected
Of some Corruption: for, it may be thought,
That money must be made of wh^t is bought.
Let him the causes of Abuse discern;
Let him the cure of every mischi^f^ learn;
Let him of what he knowe^h, practice make;
Let all his People, his example take.
Give them repentance for their passed crimes;
As^ist them by thy grace, in future times;
And send thy Holy-Spi^i^ through their Lands,
To keep them in the way of thy Commands.
So, thou in their Devotions wilt ^e p^eas'd,
So, all thine anger will be quite appeased;
So, King and People, praise thee shall* together;
And, then, thou need'st not send these Armies thithe^.
Thus MERCY spoke; and more she would have said
(For, she could everlastingly have praid)
To this effect. But* JUSTICE having spied
Gods eye to ma^ke, how she seemed satisfied;
(And looki^g somewh^t sternly, to betoken
That MERCY in her injury had spoken)
Thus interrupted her. Fair Sister, stay;
And, do not think to bear my right away
With smoo^hed words. Thou art an Advocate
Well known to be the most importunate
That ever pleaded: and, thou have a trick
With these moist eyes, beyond all Rhetoric.
So that, unless I make it still appear,
What gross offenders all thy Clients are,
A Bill of mine (how just soever the case)
Would seldom in this great Star Chamber pass.
No place, no persons, are so dissolute,
But if they whine to thee, thou make suit
On their behalfes. Thou were Soliciter
For King Manasses (that Idolater
And gotst his pardon. Thou have Proctresse bin
For Jeroboam (who m^de Israel sin)
That hand recuring which he did extend,
The Messenger of God, to apprehend.
Thou art f^r any who in thee believes,
Though Tray^ers, Strumpets, Murderers, or Th^eves.
Thou prayd'st for N^neveh; yea thou have prayed
For Sodom; and my hand had sure been staid
When I consumed them, if there had been, then,
In five great Cities, b^t ten righteou^ men.
I never yet could get a verdict past
On any Sinner, but thou crossed it have,
Upon the teast repentance. And if ^ver
To serve an Execution I endeavor,
Thou; still, one means or other do procure,
To mi^igate the strictest forfeiture.
Thee, for delaying Judgments, I prefer
Even far before the Courts at Westminster.
And, if I longer these thy deal^ngs bear,
Thou here wilt use me, as they use me there.
For, lat^ly I survey^d it; and saw
Their Chauncery had half devoured their Law.
Sweet Lady call to mind, there is a due
Pertaining equally to me and you.
As nothing without MERCY should be done;
So JUSTICE should not be encroa^ht upon.
I claim a Daughters part, and I desire
To keep min^ own inh^ritance in^ire.
I, for your sake, huge Armies, often save,
When they had, else, been rotting in the grave.
I suffer you to wipe more sins away
Then twice ten thousand millions in a day.
There Is none whom I do punish for his crimes,
B^t I doescarre him first, a thousand times
(At your entreaty) when, if I had pleased,
I might so many times his life have seized.
Yea, I should none have injured* though I had
Of all the World, long since, a Bone-fire made.
For, what effects has your Compassi^n wrought?
What Offring^, to Gods Altars, now are brought
By my long sparing them? Nay, have they not
Him, and his aw^ull power, the more forgot?
What did I say? forgot him? If they had
Used him and his Indulgence but so bad,
Thou might have spoken for them; and I could
Have left thy supplications uncontrolled.
But, they have aggravated their neglect,
With such base villainies, such disrespect,
And such contempt of Him, of Thee, and Me,
That if we bear it, we shall scorned be.
They so presumptuous are, that well I know,
Were but a petty- Justice used so,
He would not brook it: But, so rough appear,
That all the sin-professing houses near,
Of Reformation would be much in doubt;
And fear they should not buy his Ange^ out,
Though they presented him with coin and wares;
And b^ib'd his Clarke, with whom, it is thought he s^ares.
I will not therefore palliate their despite;
I will not be debarred of my right;
I will not make my self a public scorn;
Nor will I longer bear what I have borne.
Here with (as if she thought it were in vain,
For Vengeance, unto MERCY to complain)
She raised her eyes; she fixed them upon
The ^hrone of heaven, and Him that sat thereon:
Then bowed thrice, and, then to her complaint*
She ^hus proceeded lik^ an An^ry Saint
Great IVDGE of all the world just, wise, and holy;
Who sin abhorrest, and correctest folly:
Who drivest all uncleanness from thy sight,
And feared art, even of the most upright:
Consider well my Cause, and let thou not
Thy JUSTICE in thy MERCY be forgot*
As well as this my sister, so am I
United unto thee essentially
Before all Time; and there is cause for me
To boast thy favor, full as much as she.
For, to maintain thy Justice (and approve
That sacred, never violated Love
Thou bear me) great Monarkies have drunk
Thy cup of wrath; and into ruin sunk.
For their contempt of me, thou have rejected
The Nation, of all Nations, most affected.
Once, thou the Globe of Earth did wholly drown;
From Heaven thou threw^st the sinful Angels down^:
And (which is more) thy Best beloved died,
That my displeasure might be satisfied.
But, let no former favor me avail,
If now of Reason on my side I fail.
I never did a Vengeance, yet pursue
Before it was required by double due.
I never plagued any in despite,
Nor in the death of sinners took delight.
Why therefore thus is my proceeding staid?
And thy just wrath so suddenly alaid?
Has Mercy their offenses veiled so,
That thou beholdest not what faults they do?
And will thou still continue thy compassion
To this unthankful and forgetful Nation?
What are they, but a most corrupted breed?
A wicked, a perverse, ungrateful seed?
A people for instruction so untoward,
So stubborn in their courses, and so ^roward,
That, neither t^reats, nor plagues, nor love can mend them,
And therefore Desolation must attend them.
Me they have injured, past all ^ompare;
They flout me to my face; they me out dare
Even on my Iudgement-se^ts; they truth deny*
Although they knew, their hear^rs know they lie.
They use my Titles, and my Offices,
But as a means to rob, or to oppress
The poorer sort: and he that wrong sustaines,
Is sure of more, if he for right complains.
Search thou their Streets, their Markets, and their Courts;
Note where the greatest multitude resorts,
And if thou find a man among them, th^re,
That has of Truth or Judgment any care,
Him let thine Angel save. But, thou shall see
That nothing else from heel to head they be,
But swellings, wounds, and sores: that they are wholly
O'regrowne with leprosies of noisome folly;
And that, among them, there abides none,
Whose path is right and p^rfect, no not one.
Their studies, are in che^ting tricks, and shifts.
Their practice, is to compass bribes, and gifts.
Their silver is but dross. Their wine impure.
Their finest gold, will not the touch endure.
The poor oppress the poor. The Child ass^mes
An El^ers place. The basest Groom presu^es
Before the Noble. Wom^n t^ke on them
Men's habits and subjection do contemn.
Men grow ^ffemin^te. Age dotes, Youth raves,
The begger's proud. The rich man, basely craves.
The neighbor of his neighbor goes in danger;
The brother to the brother grows a stranger.
There is no kin, but Cousnage. Few profess
Affection, Amity, or Friendlinesse,
But to dec^ive. If men each ^ther greet,
With shows of wondrous friendship, when they meet,
They do but practice kin^ly to betray;
And jeere, and scoff, when they depart away:
They labor, and they study, ly^s to make:
To grow more wicked, serious pains they take:
Wolves are as merciful: Their Dogs as holy:
Virtue, they count a Fool: Religion, folly.
Their Laws are but their nets, and ginn^s, to take
Those whom they hate, and seek their prey to make:
The patronage of truth, no^e stands for:
The way of Piety, they do abhor:
They meet u^seene, the harmless to ^eceive*
They h^tch the Cocatrice: They s^ely weave
The Spiders web; and, when in bed they a^e,
They lie and study pl^ts of mischief ^here.
And, why thus fares it? b^t, because they see
That (how unjust soever their Courses b^)
They prosper in t^eir wicked nesse, and ^hrive,
Whilst they who honor thee a^fl^^ted live.
If any man reprove their damned way,
They persecute, and slander him, and say;
Come, let us smite him with our tongue, that he,
And his reproves, may unregarded be.
They desp'rately resolve a wicked Course;
And, every day proceed from bad* to wo^se.
Themselves they sooth in evil: and profess
In public manner, Trades of wickedness*
They impudently boast of their Transgressions,
And madly, glory in their great Opp^essions.
Yea, some so far have ^ver-gone the Devils
In shamelessness, that they make brag of evils
Which they committed not (as if they feared
That else they had not lewd enough a^p^ar'd)
Whereas, they from themselves would strive to fly,
If they could s^e their own defo^mity.
For, what remains to be termed ill
Which they are guil^lesse of, in act, or will?
They, gall unto the hungry prof^r'd have:
They, vine^er unto the thirsty gave:
With brutish fierceness they themselves array:
Unsatisfied in their lust are they,
And neither earth nor heaven escapes the w^ongs
Of their injurious and blasph^mous tongue^.
With every member, they dishonor Thee,
No part of them from wick^dnesse is free:
Their Eyes, are wandering after vanity,
And l^ere about, advantages to spy.
Their Ears are deaf to goodness; but most pro^e
To hear a sl^nder told of any one:
And h^ve an itching after every thin^,
Which, news of sensuality, may bring.
Their braz^n Foreheads, without shame appear:
Their Teeth are sharper then a sword o^ spear:
Their Lips, as keenly cut, as Razors do;
And, under them, is Add^rs poison too.
Their Mouths with bitter cu^sings, overflow:
Their oily Tongues, contention dail^ sow:
In Heart, they Falsehood before Truth, prefer:
Their Throats, are like a gaping Sepulcher:
Foul belchings from their Stomachs do arise,
Even filthy speeches; and rank bl^sphemies.
Their Hands (their right hands) lawless gifts receive:
With Bribes, their Fingers, they desiled have.
Their Feet, are swift in executing ill,
And, run the blood of innocents to spill.
They are corrupt in every Faculty;
In Understanding, Will, and Memory;
Yea, their most specious works of piety
Are little else, but mere hypocrisy.
All stained with Murders, Thef^s, Adulteries,
And other unrepented Villainies
Thy House they enter, as if they were cle^re,
Or, thither came, but to out brave thee there.
There, they display their pride: there, they contemn
Thy Messengers* or, sit and censure them.
There, they disturb thy Children in their prayers,
By tatling of impertinent affairs.
The many roving looks, they throw about,
Do prove them, far more wanton, than devout.
And, say, they bring devotion for a fit:
Alas! what pleasure can thou take in it?
Or, what do they but mock thee, when they pray,
Unless their wickedness they cast away?
What profits it, to kneel sometime an hour?
To fast a day? to look demure, or sour?
To raise the hands aloft? the breast to strike?
To shake the head, or hang it Bulrush like?
And, all that while to have no thought of thee;
But on base projects, musing, there, to be?
I many such enormities might name,
Wherein this People have been much to blame.
And, shall they still, thy gentleness contemn?
Will thou forbear, for this, to punish them?
Shall such devotion be regarded more,
Then if they brought the ^yring of a whore?
Or sacrificed a Dog? Nay, though they had
Of far fet Calamus an Offering made,
Or, incense brought from Sheba; do they think
The smoke of that, shall take away the stink
Of their corruption? shall this wicked Throng*
(Who partners are in every kind of wrong,
And Reformation hate) still spared be
Because they can a little prate of thee?
Make zealous outward shows; and preach thy word,
Whose power they have denied? (if not abhorred:)
Let me consume them rather. For, Compassion
So often has prevailed for this Nation,
That, all my threatenings are no whit regarded,
Thy Pity is with disrespect rewarded;
Thy Blows do nothing soften them: but, more
Hard hearted, rather, make them then before.
They neither know nor s^eke thee. They scarce daigne
So much as thoughts of thee to entertain.
Or if they do; yet, thou in kindness, have
So frequently, their errors over past
With gentle stripes; that they conjecture, now
That thou art like to them, and do allow
Their wick^d courses. For, Is there (say they)
In God, or sight, or knowledge of our way?
Does he behold, or car^ what things we do?
Will he take vengeance? Tush, it is not so.
Such fables were devised in times of old,
And of strange judgments, stories have been told;
But, who has seen them? or, when will appear
That Day of Doom, whereof so often we hear?
Sure never. For the wo^ld does still remain
The same it was; and these are fears in vain.
Oh! what will this increase unto, if thus
Thou suffer them to make a scorn of us?
Where is thy fear, if thou a Master be?
Why, (if a God) should they not honor thee?
What means thy long long-suffring? and, what way
To work amendment will thou next assay?
Thou have already moved them to repent,
By Threats, Gifts, Precepts, and by Punishment.
To stop their wi^kednesse, thou Floods, and Drought,
Frosts, F^^es, and Tempests, have upon them brought.
Distempers, F^ights, and (many times of late)
Distrusts, and hazzards of the public State.
With every kind of Sickness, thou have tried them;
With Pestilence, and Famine, mortified them:
With Slaughters ^hou has^ foild them; and betwix^
Each Plague, thou Mercy still have intermixed*
Yet* all in vain. Oh! rise, and suffer me
On all at once avenged now to be.
Pluck from thy bosom, thy sure striking hand,
And, let it fall so heavy on that Land,
That, all their Follies may their merit have,
And, they be put to silence in the grave.
Permit them not unplagued to persever,
Blaspheming thus, thy Name and thee for ever.
But, let me every Plague upon them cast,
Which thou, for such as they, prepared have.
Let them perceive, that they have loved and served
Those gods, by whom they cannot be preserved.
Let me transport from their polluted Coast,
Those Holy-things, whereof they vainly boast:
And, let not their profaneness be protected
By that, which they so much have disrespect^d.
For, why should thou forbear this people more
Then ma^y other Nations heretofore?
Since they for their example those have had
The less excusable their faults are made.
Yea, though their wickedness were but the same,
Yet, they are worthy of a greater blame.
(...) What are they better then the stubborn Jews?
Wherein, do they thy blessings less abuse?
What have their Temples, of more worth in them
Then Shilo, Bethel, or Jerusalem,
That we should spare their ma^y sleepled Towers,
Not rather making them the Ne^sts, and Bowres
Of noisome Vermin, and such fatal Fowls,
As croking Ravens, and loud screeching Owls?
Why should thou not, as low this I Will decline,
As Milk and Hony-flowing Palestine?
What ^ave they more deserved of thy pity
Then Sion, thy so much bel^ved Cit^y?
Or, wherefore should their Seed be thought upon
More kindly, the^ the br^tts of Babylon?
Why should their Common wealth, more prised be,
Then thos^ great Monarchies destroyed b^ me
In former ages, whose transcendent Fate,
^ach Time succeeding, has admired at?
Yea, since the World thou did for s^^ning, drown,
Why should such mercy to thi^ Land be shown?
If thou a piou^ King to them ^ast given,
What loses be, if then from thence to Heaven
Translate him shall? From earthly Crowns, to wear
Those wreathes of Glory that immortal are?
And from a froward People, to have place
With Angels, and there triumph in thy grace?
If any man be found observing thee,
To him what coffeehouse can it be
To view my hand prevailing over those
Who me in my proceedings did oppose?
And see those Tyrants ruined, who have long
Committed violence, and offered wrong
To him, and his? what b^rme has he I pray,
To pass through all that sorrow in one day,
And in thy blessed pres^nce to appear,
Who else might here have lingered many a year?
Of what can he complain, if being borne
Above the reach of every future scorn,
Within thy heavenly Mansion, he possess
A perfect, and an endless happiness?
Why may not JUSTICE glorify ^hy Name,
As well as MERCY can extol the same?
Why should thy former favors, being lost,
Oblige thee to defray a future cost
On Prodigals, and Unthrifts, who had rather
Live Swineherds, than return to th^e their Father?
Why may not that reproach d^verted be,
Which irreligious men will cast on thee
Although thou spare not hypocrites; and them
Who are the causers that thy Foes blaspheme?
What disadvantage can their fall effect
To thy pure honor? or, to thine elect,
Which may not be prevented (if thou ^lease)
Although thou be not mer^ifull to these?
Sure, none at all: and, therefore, I will stay
My hand no longer; but break off delay.
Thy Sword and Balance, are with me in trust;
To punish Sin, I know it to be just;
They both arraigned, and condemned are;
My warrant^, in thy written Word appea^e:
Their crimes, for Vengeance, loudly crying ^e:
Thy Judgments, ready mustred are, by ^hee:
Thine eye does speak unto me to be gone;
And, lo; I fly to see thy pleasure done.
As when a Mother on a sudden hearing
Her babe to shrieke, (and some disaster fearing
That may befall ^he child) starts up and flies
To see the reason of her Infants cries:
So quick, was JUSTICE; and e're now, had brought
Her work, to something; and, this Land, to naught.
^ut, to prevent her purpose, MERCY cast
Her arm about that angry Virgins waste*
Looked sadly on her; hung about her; kissed her,
And (weeping in her bosom) said, Sweet Sister,
I pray thee, do not thus impatient grow,
Nor prosecute deserved Vengeance, so.
Thou art most beautiful; sincerely just;
Most perf^ctly upright in all thou do;
For which ^h^ne excellency, and p^rfection,
I love thee with an excel^ent a^^ection.
And though thou frownest; yet thy frownings be
So lovely, that I cannot part from thee.
What though some Worldlings offer thee disgraces*
Shall they (Sweet heart) make loathed my embraces?
Shall thou, and I, (who near^r are then twins)
Fall out, o^ be divorced by their sins?
Oh never let it said, or mutt red be,
That we in any thing can disagr^e.
For what is more lo^ely, or more sweet then thi^,
That we each other may embrace and kiss?
And by our mutual workings, and agreeings,
Bring all Gods Creatures to their perfect beings.
Belee^e me (Dear) Heaven does not comprehend
That pleasure, which this pleasure does transcend:
Nor is our Father better pleased in us,
Then when he sees our arms emwined, thus.
For should we jarre, the world would be undone,
And Heaven, and Earth, into a Chaos run.
What profit can it bring, or what content,
To see a Kingdom miserably rent,
With manifold afflictions? what great good
To us redoundeth by the death, or b^ood
Of any man? what honor can we have?
What praise, from those that in the silent gra^e
Lie raked up in ruins dead and rotten?
Or in the Land where all things are forgotten?
Seek not thy Glory by their Overthrow,
That are pursued by too strong a F^e,
And over-match'd already; think upon
The powerful hate of that malicious One.
Rem^mber they were f^amed of the dust;
And that to Cl^y again return they must.
When they are dead they pass away for ever,
Even as that vapor which returns never.
Oh; make them not the Butt of thy displeasure,
Nor give them of Gods wrath the fullest measure.
I grant this Realm is sinful; But, what has
That Realm, or people equalling thy wrath?
It Is honorable, when we stoop below
Our selves; that love or favor we may show*
Or to correct, with purpose to amend:
But if with such we Foe-like should contend*
It would appear, as if some Empery
Did arm it self, to combat with a Fly.
When we correction, or forgiveness daigne,
We may correct them, or forgive again:
But in destroying quite, our selves we wound,
And to our Infiniteness, set a bound;
For JUSTICE neither MERCY can have pl^ce*
In subjects, which we totally deface.
We must not seek for purity divine
In dust and ashes; till we first refine
From earthly dross the gold that we desire,
By using of the Bellows and the Fire.
For till we purge it, what (alas) is good,
Or what can holy be in Flesh and Blood?
Who looks that Figs on Thistles should be borne,
^r that sweet Grapes should grow upon a Thorn?
It cannot be. As therefore hereto^ore
God promis^d, (that he would never more
Contend with man) let us resolve the same;
And by some other means, their wildenesse tam^.
Keep, yet a while, this Army where it is*
And let us try to mend what is amiss,
(As erst we did) by sending jointly thither,
Our Favors, and Corrections, both together:
And if they profit not, there is a Day
In which thine Indi^nation shall have way.
As when a Father, who, in heat of wrath
To give a son correction purposed has,
Enraged is, until his lovely wife
Does interpo^e her self with friendly strife;
But (pleased in the sweetness of her speech,
Who to forgive the Child does him beseech)
Does lay aside his whole displeasure, then,
And turn his anger into smiles again;
So, JUSTICE was by MERCY wrought upon:
And she that would with so much haste be gone,
Forgot her speed; Her loving Sister eyed
With calmer looks; and thus to her replied.
Thou, and thy charmings have prevailed upon me,
And to abate mine anger thou have won me.
I therefore will not cast my plagues on all,
But on worst Livers, only, let them fall.
Nay, nay, quoth MERCY, thou must favor show
To most of them, or thou will overthrow
The laws of Destiny; and crossed will be
What God did from eternity decree.
For, some of these have not fulfilled yet
Their sins, nor made their number up complete.
Some, that are wandering in the ways of folly,
Shall be regenerated, and made holy.
Of them some have morality, that may
Be helpful to Gods childr^n, in their way;
Some, must be left, as were the Cana'nites,
To exercise the faithful Isr'elites;
Yea some, have in their loins a generation
Unborn, which must make up the blessed Nation.
And till that seed bud forth, those trees must s^and,
Although they grow but to annoy the Land.
It seems (quoth JUSTICE) I must then abide,
(However they off^nd) unsatisfi'd.
Vns^tisfi'd ( said MERCY) Is it that,
Sweet Sister, which your zeal has aimed at?
Then, look you there. And with that word, her eye
She pla^'d on him, who sits in Majesty
At Gods right hand. Behold that Lamb (quoth she)
By him thou fully satisfied shall be.
He poor was made, that He their debt might pay;
He base became, to take their shame away;
He entered bond, their freedom to procure;
He dangers tried, their safeties to assure;
He scorned was, their honor to advance;
He seemed a fool, to help their ignorance;
He sin was made, their errors to conceal;
He wounded was, that he their wounds might heal;
He thirsted, that their thirst might have an end;
He wept, that joy their sorrow might attend;
He lost his blood, that they their blood might save;
He died, that they eternal life might have.
Nor can thou any for their sins condemn,
(Since he has over-paid the price for them)
If by partic'lar faith they shall apply
That pardon, which he grants gen'rally.
And lest to that whole Kingdom thou deny it,
For want of application, I apply it.
Why then ( said JUSTICE) I may quite dismiss
This host of Plagues which here assembled is.
Not so, replied MERCY: For no curse
Is greater, n^r is any mischief worse
Then want of due correction: And if I
Should yield to that, it were not Clemency,
But cruel dealing; and my love no other
Then is the kindness of that cock^ing m^ther,
Who spares the rod (out of her pure affection)
And sends unto the Gallows for correction:
As if she thought her children apt for learning,
If they could take a hanging for a warning*
I s^eme to cr^sse thy workings, and thou mine,
To those that n^^ther know my ways, nor thi^e:
But, is the motions in a Clock do tend
And move together to one purposed end,
Although their wheels contrary courses go^,
And force the even balance to and f^o.
Even so, although it may to some appear,
That our proceedings much repugnant are;
Yet in our disagreeings, we agree,
And helpful to our chi^fe desi^ne they be*
We therefore, from Gods A^my will select
One Regiment, this people to correct.
Not his that is the General: for, he
Resists us if he prevail^ng be.
Nor Famine; For, (unless permit we shall
That she devour, until we starve up all)
She most unequally consumes the poor,
And makes the rich to be enriched more.
Nor will we send the Sword; for, that makes way
For every plague to follow; yea, does lay
All open to confusion; and bestows
The power of God often times upon his foes.
But, we to punish them, will send from hence,
The dreadful, and impartial PESTILENCE.
For, she does neither Ri^h, nor Poor prefer;
The foolish, and the wise, are one to her:
Nor eloquence, nor beauty, nor complexion,
Prevails wi^h her; Nor Hatred, nor Affection.
S^e seizes All alike; she visits
The Palace, as the Cottage; and with death,
Or else with sickness, strikes at each degree,
Unless our Supersedeas, granted be.
By means of her, in any State, or City,
Thou may avenge, and I may show my pity
With little noise; and both at once, ^ulfill
Our wishes, and accompl^sh all our will.
For, where a noisome we^d is seen to sprout,
She shall, at thy appointment, weed it out.
Or if a plant, or bud, or flower we see,
That Is ripe for Heaven, and may impaired be
By standing longer; we the same will gather,
To m^ke a precious Posie for our Father.
And, as t^ou have thy purpose, by their fall.
Or smart, whom she or wound, or slaught^r shall:
Right so have I: For, if they wicked are
Whom she removes; the better shall they fare,
Whose Conversations truly honest be;
And from oppression live the longer free.
If righteous men this Judgments ^rey become,
It is appointed to secure them from
Some greater Plague, which must (perhaps) be sent
To scourge this Kingdom, ere it will repent;
Or (peradventure) that my hand may take them
From Earth, the Citizens of Heaven to make them:
And some, who never e^se on God had thought,
Shall, (by her whip) unto his love be brought.
This pleased well, and IVSTIC^ did agree
With MERCY, that it should all^wed be:
And, for the swift ^ulfilling of their mind,
The PESTILENCE, by warrant, was assi^n'd
Great Brittan to invade; and limited
Where to begin the Plague; how far to spread;
How many she should wound; how many slay;
How many grieve; how many fright away;
How long abide; and when her term was done,
On what conditions (then) she must be gone.
Moreover lest her stroke should not amend u^,
Gods Host of Plagues had warrant to attend us;
That if the Pestilence could not prevail,
Another might our wicked Land assail;
And then another, till we did repent,
Or were consumed in our chastisement.
The Prince of Darkness, (though he could not gain
Permission, fully to unloose his Chain)
His usual power obtained to work despite
On some offenders, and to use the sleight Of Lying-wonders: or by strong temptation
To seize upon the Sons of Reprobation:
Yea many times to buffet (for correction)
Even those that have the seals of Gods election.
Dear^h was commanded, that (to make us fear
A Scarceness^) she should scatter here, and the^e,
A Flood, or Tempest; and at sometime bring
A droughty Sum^er, or a frosty Spring,
Or Mel-dewes, to remember us, from whom
The blessings of a plenteous year do come.
War, (who had quite forgotten us almost)
Enjoined was to sit upon our Coast;
To sail about our Shore, to view our Forts,
To visit all our Havens, and our Ports:
And with her dreadful sounds, to rouse and keep
This Kingdom, from securities dead sleep.
But was commanded, not to seize a hoof
Of what was ours, till God has made a proof
How mollifi'd our stony hearts will be;
What fruits of true repentance he shall see;
What change will be effected in this Land,
By his correcting us with his own hand;
And what oblations of true thanks, and love,
We render will upon this Plagues remove.
Wherein, if we do fail his expectation,
We shall be made a miserable Nation.
The Sea that now does close us, like a wall,
Shall be a Sea o^ terror; and it shall
Let in our foes upon us, or with ^louds
O're-flow our borders, and devour our goods.
Our wealthy Traffiques, and that foreign Trade,
(Whereby so proud, and wanton we are made)
Cut off shall be, and fail in every Coast.
Our numerous Fle^ts (whereof so much we boast,
(And, in whole power and mu^titude, I fear
Ou^ trust, and hopes too much reposed are)
By Storms, and Piracies, that shall pursue them,
Or want of means, and trading to renew them,
Shall waste away unheeded; till we see
Our ha^mes beyond our means of curing be.
Our H^uses shall by strangers be possessed;
Our goodly Temples, which, (as yet) are blessed
With Gods true worship, shall be razed, or bu^ned,
Or into dens of theevery be turned.
Throughout those champain fields, and forests, where
We hunted for our pleasure; we by Fear
Shall hunted be: and made a prey for them
Whom we (perhaps) did most of all contemn.
Our People, (on whose numbers we presume)
Shall by degrees be less^ned, and consume.
Our Nation (late renowned through the World)
Shall be unvalu'd, as old rubbish, hu^l^d
In some by-corner, and quite round about us
Our Foes, our Neighbo^s, and our Friends shall flout us.
O^r Peace, shall make us but effeminate.
Our Riches, and our plentiful estate,
Shall but enrich our enemies; and we
(That of our King so glad, and hopeful be)
Shall (for our sins, perchance) be quite d^prived
O^ those great comforts, which we have conceived.
For, e^^he^ God may give an ^ll success
To his bent Counsels, for our f^owardnesse;
Or leave us some dist^ustings in our heart,
To make us censure in an evil part
His gracious purposes; or give a power
To some ill-willers of his peace, and our,
To sow the seeds of Discord, and divide
Our heart^, which now so lovingly are tied:
Or let some Politician wo^ke upon
His Goodness; and so cunningly go on,
That he shall never find, how he, and his
Are injured, till all things are amiss:
Which God forbid; yea, grant (O Lord) that I
In these su^posals may not prophecy;
As (out of doubt I shall) if any sin
(That may procure it) we continue in.
Yea, though our Projects may a while possess
Our hearts with flatt'^ing hopes of good success;
Th^ugh in aff^ires of War, and in our Fights
We thrive a while, as did the Benj^mites;
Although a league with Baalam we began;
And ^erodach the son of Baladan
Had sent us presents; and though he shall seem
To have our health and welfa^e in esteem;
Though to his Lords the treasures we declare,
Which in Gods Temple here among us are:
Yea, though we g^ve those holy things, to buy
His love, and Babylonish amity:
It should but linger us along, till they
(Who seek our overthrow) their snares do lay*
Until they have enlarged their growing powers,
And by their Policy, befooled ours;
Or, till our sins, or our securities
Have ma^e us objects for their Tyrannies,
And, there enthralled us, where long since were hung
On willow trees, untuned, and unstrung,
The Harpes of Syon; and where Men contemn
The heavenly Sonnets of Jerusalem.
Even this shall be our lot, and worse then this,
If we continue still to do amiss,
Or bring not forth the fruits of Penitence,
When God has scourged us by the Pestilen^^.
But, if that stir us to repenting shall,
He will not only back again recall
That raging Plague, to which he gave such pow'^
Within our peopled Cities to devour:
But, he will also on this Realm bestow
New benefits, for entertaining so,
With lowliness, his fatherly correction;
And yielding him our filial affection.
Then, every one beneath his Vine shall si^
Without disturbance; and with pleasure eat
The profit of his labors. Men shall go
In ^afety through ^he Kingdom, to, and fro.
Their Lands they shall enjoy in peace; and wear
The warmest fleeces, that their flocks do bear.
No sons of Belial, shall from them divert
Their Princes favor (in the smallest part)
Nor shall Seditions Lovers draw from him
Their loyalties, by misinforming them;
But God that blessed union shall maintain,
Which ought 'twixt King and People to remain^.
He, then, will multiply the fruits increase;
Prese^ve our plenty, sanctify our peace:
And guide by Land and Sea, our preparations
Of l^wfull war, to seize upon those Nations
That are our foes, and his. Which, that He may
Vouchsafe unto us; let us every day
Produce of thankfulness some new effect:
Let us observe (with every due respect)
The progress of that Plague sent lately hither;
How CLEMENCY and JUSTICE came togeth^r;
Relating to each other what we saw
To kindle love, or keep our souls in awe;
And so record it, that (should we be rotten)
It may be still p^eserved unforgotten.
For, that we might his honor forth declare,
We both created, and preserved were.
To such a purpose, I do thus employ
That scorned Faculty, which I enjoy;
And (for the compa^^ing of my intention)
Have offr^d up the best of my invention;
And what that is (to those, who do regard
Such pains) the following Cantoes have declared
Behold (O Lord) my purposes from heaven,
Accept of me the gift that thou have given.
Permit not those, who spite or malice me,
To interrupt my M^se in praising t^ee.
Let none of those, who find that I neglect
The way to wealth, which they ^oo much affect,
Conceive, that I my Time have spent in vain,
Because their Studies yield them greater gain;
Let them perceive, though this endeavor brings
Nor Riches, Honors, nor esteem of Kings;
But rather wastes my Fortunes, and does more
Increase my charge, and troubles, then before;
Let them (I say) conceive, and also know,
That I am highly pleased, it should be so;
And would not change the bless^ng of my Fate
With those, whom they do hold more fortunate.
And let not that, which I have here comprised*
Become (through my unworthiness) despised;
But grant it such a moderate respect,
That I may see my labors take effect
For their enc^uragements, who shall apply
To such goode^ds, their gift of Poesy;
And let all those, who shall peruse my Story*
Receive some profit, and give thee, the glory.
The second Canto.
Our Muse defends her lowly style;
And (having flowne aside a while)
Tells, how the Plague first entered here*
What means to stay it practiced were.
Some vulg^r Tenets are disputed;
Some rectified, some refuted.
She from the Nature, and the Cause,
Of that Disease, conclusions draws;
Declares how it runs and creepes,
And what un^ertaine paths it keeps:
How long strict orders useful stood;
The fruit of Christian neighborhood;
And many other things, be^wixt
These mentioned, are intermixed.
She sh^we^h (also) means assured
By which, this mischief may be cured;
How to apply that means; how those
Who use it, should themselves compose;
How violent the Plague did grow;
Who from it might, or might not go;
How much it was feared; how men fled;
How ill, in flying, many sped;
And lastly (as occasion moves)
She grieves, she counsels, and reproves.
LEt no fantastique Reader now condemn
Out homely Muse, for stooping unto them,
In plain expressions, and in words, that show
We love not, in affected paths, to go.
For, to be understood, is language used;
And speech to other ends as much abused*
Lines, therefore, over-darke, or over-trimm'd,
Are like a Picture with a Visour limm'd;
Or like Poma^ders of a curious sent,
Within a painted Box that has no vent;
Or like Peach-kernels, which, (to get them forth)
Require more cracking, then the fruit is worth.
Let no man guess, my Measures framed be,
That wiser men, my little wit may see;
Or that I do not hold the matter good,
Which is not more admired then understood:
For, chiefly, such a Subject I desire,
And such a plain Expression, to acquire,
That every one my meaning may discern;
And they be taught, that have most need to learn.
It is the useful matter of my Rim^s
Shall make them live. Wo^ds alter as the Times:
And soonest their fantastique Rhetoriques,
Who trim their Poesies with schooleboy-tricks.
That, which this age affects, as grave, and wise,
The fo^lowing generation may despise.
Green^s phr^se, and ^^llie's language were in fashion,
And had among the wits much c^mmendation;
But now, another garb of speech, with us
Is pri^'d; and thei^s is thought ridi^ulous;
As ours (perchance) will be, when Time (who changes
Things changea^l^) the present phrase estrangeth.
Let no m^n therefore dream, I will bestow
My precious Time in what will vary so;
Since that, which, with most ease I shall produce,
May have (for ought I know) the longest use.
Let no man think, I Will rack my memory
For pen and-inkehorne-termes, to finifie
My blunt invention; trimming it, as they
Who make rich clothes but for Saint George his day;
When they may be^ter ^heape a suite provide,
To fit that feast, and many days beside.
Nor let unlearned Censurers suppose
Our Muse a course unwarrantable ^oes,
In framing Objects representative,
Which may imprint* or in the soul revive,
True feelings of that wrath or love, which we
In God almighty, by Faiths eyes do see.
For, though his holy Spirit, when he will,
Can easily the soule^ of mortals fill
With heavenly knowledges, by ways unseene;
Yet, he himself has sometime pleased been
By ou^ward object^ to employ the senses,
In reaching to the soul some excellencies
Concealed before. Yea, many times he suites
His Deity in our poor attributes;
And (that our weakness he may work upon)
Our usual speech, and passions, he puts on*
If so; then we, that have no other way
Our hidden apprehensions to convey
From Man to Man, but by the qu^int creation
Of some Ideaes in our contemplation;
That so the senses may become inclined
To give some information to the mind:
Then we (I say) whose fluid memories
Would else let go our ayrie fantasies,
May such a libe^^y with warrant use.
And I (no doubt) my self may well excuse,
If other while things bodilesse I cloth
With mortal bodies; and do give them both
Our speeches, and our gestures* For, by this
A dull affection often quickened is.
Nor thus to do, are Poets only moved
But, these are strains Pro^heticall, approved.
To say, that God is angry; or that he
Will of our wickedness avenged be;
Moves little: but, to paint his fury, so
That Men the dreadfulnesse thereof may know,
As if they s^w it: or his love to make
So pleading of our cause, as if it spoke
(Within our hearing) with such earnestness,
As friends would plead for friends in their distress^;
Does much incite the Reader to attention,
And rouseth up the dullest apprehension.
Me thinks, I do, (as with mine eye) behold
The real sight of all that I have told:
Yea, that which I my self described here,
Does touch mine heart with re^ere^ce, and fea^e.
I have perpetual Visions of that rout
Of Plagues, and Iud^emen^s, which do rove about
To punish us. And, from that dreadful host
I see (me thinks) how to invade our Coast,
The Plague marched hither, like a Regiment
That is for services of moment sent
From some great Army. And, when I can bend
My troubled spirits truly to attend
Gods Judgments, and his Mercies, as they go
Their daily progress; I can reach unto
Much pleasing thoughts; and oftentimes foresee,
What his intents, and their even^^ will be:
For, when Man's heart is filled with his Fear,
The secrets of the Lord to him appear.
Oh! what rich treasures does my soul possess,
When I do contemplate the blessedness,
The Wisdom* and the Way of God most high?
How far above my self raised up am I?
How little want I, ^ha^ the world can give?
What heights ascend I? what huge depths I dive?
How much contemn I dangers here below?
How c^rtaine of Gods favors can I grow?
And wi^h what sweetn^sse is my breast inspired,
When (by the heat of Contemplation fired)
I sit locked up within a lonely room,
Where nothing to disturb my thoughts may come;
And where may enter neither sight, nor Notion
Of any thing, but what may ^^irre Devotion?
Sure, were it not, that I am clothed about
With flesh, that does compel me to come out;
Or, knew I not the Christian Man's estate
Extend^d ^urther, t^en to contemplate;
Or saw not them unthankfully precise,
Who Gods external blessings quite despise;
Or feared I not* I never should have union
With God, unless I were in some communion
Of Saints on earth; whom I might sharers make
Of those sweet thoughts of him, which I pa^take;
Or, if I doubted not, I might with Lot,
Upon the daughters of my b^aine begot,
Commit some spiritual incest, had I none
To spend the seed of my full Soul upon:
Or, if I found it not unnatural,
To leap out of the world, till God did call;
And that fantastique ways of selfe-contenting
Are but the certain paths to selfe-tormenting;
If all these things I knew not; I could bide
Shut up, until my flesh we^e Mummy-si'd;
And (though the world should woo me) would disd^in
(For ever) to unclose my door again.
For though (when I come sorth) I lose again
My ^aptures; and have thoughts like other men;
Because my natural f^ailties, and the fog
Of earthly Vanities, my soul does clog:
Yea, though I can as hardly keep those firings
Vnquench'd abroad, which are (in my retirings
Inflamed in me;) as a naked Man
Retain that heat upon a ^ountaine can,
Which in a close warm chamber he retains:
Ye^ (for my comfort) somewhat still remains:
And in my recollections I possess
More happiness, then I can well express.
I view contentments, which I cannot measure;
I have some tastings of immortal pleasure;
I g^immerings have of hid^en mysteries;
My ^ou^e on glorious things does fix her eyes:
And though some whited walls (who did attempt
To bring my Muse and Me, unto contempt)
Endeavor still (with shows of Piety)
My best-approved pains to v^l^fie:
I can with scorn of their base envy, raise
My thoughts above their ignorant dispraise:
And pity their dull sottishness, who prize
Their shadows better, then real^ties.
For I have searched their folly, and espied
That they have drowned their wisdom in their prid^*
Yea, by their partial dealings, I now see
They judge men's merits, as their titles be:
And I have gotten those brave things in chase,
That shall advantage me, by my disgrace.
When, therefore, by my self I am enclosed,
And for an heavn'ly rapture, well disposed;
I do not grudge mine enemies to spue
Their flanders on my name; or to pursue
My labors with reproach; nor prey to make
On all my fortunes: But all well can take.
I do not then repine, although I see
That Fools ennobled, Knaves enriched be,
And honest men unheeded: but I bide
As pleased, as I am at Whitsontide,
To see fair Nymphs in Country Towns rejected,
And sluttish Milkmaids by the Clownes elected
For Ladies of the May. And if I chance
Where any of those Hobby horses prance;
I can in sport, or courtesy, bestow
Those terms upon them, which I do not owe.
For when on Contemplations wings I fly,
I then o're-looke the highest Vanity.
I see how base those fooleries do^ show,
Which are a^mired, while I creep below:
And by the brightness of a twofold light
(Re^^ecting from Gods word to clear my sight)
Faiths objects to her eyes, much plainer are,
Then those which to my outward ^^ght appear.
My towering Soul is winged up, as if
She over-flew the top of Tenariffe,
Or some far higher Mountain; where we may
All actions of this lower World survey.
I am above the touch of malice borne;
I am beyond the reach of ^v'ry scorn;
And could -- But what mean I? this seems a ^^rai^
Impertinent* Sweet Muse, come down again;
Soar not so high. For in these lofty flights
The Fools below, do think our Eagles, Kites.
The world, to flout such Raptures now is prone;
I will enjoy them (therefore) al^ alone:
Of their unhallowed censuring take heed,
And in my former purpose, thus proceed:
When (as you heard before) the Court of Heaven
Commission to the Pestilence had given
To scourge our sins, and signed her direction^*
She took up all her boxes of Infections,
Her Carbuncles, her Sores, her Spots, her Blaines,
And every other thing which appertains
To her contagious practices; and all
Her followers she did about her call;
Appoint them to their places, and their times,
D^rect them to the Persons, and the Crimes
They should correct, and how they should advanc^
Her maine Designement in each circumstance.
Then, on she marched; not as does a Foe
Proclaiming War, before he strikes the blow;
But like an Enemy, who does surprise
Upon the first advantage he espies.
For (passing through the streets of many a Town
Disguised like a Fever) she, (unknown)
Stole into London; and did lu^ke about
The well filled Suburbs; spread^ng there (no doubt)
Inf^ction unperceived, in many a place
Before the blea^e eyed Searchers, knew her face;
And since they knew her, they have bribed been
A thous^nd times, to let her pass unseene.
But at the length, she was discovered at
A Frenchmans house without the B^shopsgate.
To intimate (perhap^) that such as be
Our spiritual Wats^men, should the more foresee
That they with d^scipline made strong the Ward,
Which God appointed has for them to g^ard;
And chiefly, at this present, to have care,
Lest now, while we, and France un^ted are
In bodily commerce; they bring unto us
Those Plagues which may eternally undo us.
For, such like Pestilences soon begin;
And (ere we be aware) will enter in,
Unless our Bishops, both betimes, and late,
Be diligent and watchful at their Gate.
As soon, as e're the Women-spyes descried,
This Foe about the City to reside;
There was a loud All-arme. The Countrymen
Began to wish themselves at home again.
The Citizens were gen'rally appal^'d;
The Senators themselves to Counsel called;
And all (who might advise in such a case)
Assembled in their Common meeting place;
Where, what discretion publicly was used;
What was admitted of, and what refused;
What policies, and stratagems invented;
That mischiefs, coming on, might be prevented,
I cannot say: For I had never wit,
Nor wealth enough, to sit in Counsel, yet.
B^^ if to judge of things it lawful were
By ^hei^ events; the propositions there
Were such as these. Most thought the surest play
To save their persons, was, to run away;
But lest some higher power might then forbid it,
They did not pu^lish that, before they did it.
Some urged, that the Scav^nger should keep
The s^reet^ more clean, and often the channel sweep;
Some thought it fit, (and these no harm did think)
That every morning we should eat, and drink.
Some (to allay the heat) did hold it meet
To sprinkle water often in the street.
Some did a little further nat'^allize,
And these unto the Air would sacrifize
(In evening fires) pure F^ankincense or Myrrh,
Sweet herbs, or odorif'rous Juniper;
Or (for default of those) Pitch, Rosin, Tar*
And such perfumings as less costly are.
For if the Heart and Liver of a Fish
(Burnt by yo^ng Tobit in a Chafind^^h)
A Spirit from his chamber could expel*
They hoped these might purge ill airs, as well:
Some others (not contented herewi^hall)
Did into consultation also call
The P^iests of Ae^culapius, and Apollo;
And held it fit their grave advice to follow:
Nor without cause. For, from the wise Physitia^
We best shall know this Enemies condition.
And some there were of those, who did advise
Not only to assume those remedies
Which Art prescribed* but also therewithal
Observed what was M^taphy^^call.
Yea, some s^ncerely, and religiously
Upon the souls infection had an eye,
As well as on the bo^ies: and th^se went
The surest way that sickness to prevent.
But there were others, who derided these,
And talked heath'nish^y of this disease.
They prated much of Humors, Incl^nations*
Conjunction, planetary Constellations;
Of natural causes, unbeleeved fictions;
Impostures, Fables, and mere contradictions
In that Phil^sophy, which they profess:
Which filled men's minds with much unsetlednesse.
Yet in their disagreeings, they agreed
On that which might their common profit breed*
One had a rare Perfume of special note;
Another had a precious Antidote,
Which at Constantinople had been tried
When there two thousand on a day have di'de.
A third, prefert'd a Mixture in a bag,
Of whose large virtues he did largely brag,
And said, the same they do in Plague times, wear
At Rome, (and so I think when he was there.)
A fourth, by Diets, safety did assure.
A fifth, by Drinks, the Pestilence would cure.
A sixth of Cordials, and Elixars prates;
And some of Treacles, and of Mithridates.
To offer up a portion of the blood
(To save the rest) for some, it seemed good.
For other some to purge: for all to take
Such means as might their purses heavy make.
They to the rich prescribed Preservatives
On costly terms: and, to prolong the lives
Of poorer men, their consciences abated
The value much: For, health, to them was rated
At some few handfuls of that herb or grass,
Which to be gotten* for the gathering was.
This being known, the Senators dismiss
Those men; and by advice it ordered is,
That some Instructions shall be published,
To further what was gravely counseled.
Moreover, that their discipline might carry
Some likeness to proceedings military,
A band of Ha^be^^s, mustred was, to guard
The people from the Plague, in every Ward.
And, if they found, by serious inquisition,
(Or, had but any probable suspicion)
Where lodged it was (although but for a night)
That Host, exiled was from public sight;
Close prisoner him they kept both night and day,
As one that els^ their City might betray.
And, to compel that his unwelcome Guest
Should keep within; his doo^e was crossed, and blessed:
And many Watchmen, strengthened by command,
Did round about his dwelling, armed stand.
I do not thus express, or mention this,
As if I thought those Orders were amiss:
But, that I might, hereby, the better show
What miseries, attended on this Foe;
And, that this Malady, on us did ce^ze,
With circumstances, worse then the Disease.
My Muse inspires not me so foolishly,
That I all natural causes do deny.
I do not think, but to this Pest^lence,
The Constellations, by their influence
Might somewhat add: and that corrupted air,
Might help our healthy being to impair.
I hold, that Diets, Meats, Complexions, Passions,
With such as these, and all their mitigations,
May help or hinder much in such diseases
As we endeavor shall; and as God pleases.
Nor do I flout the wisdom, or the pain
Of those who s^ught this mi^chiefe to restrain:
Nor blame I their much diligence, or care;
But praise it; and could wish it doubled were;
W^^h some such observ^tion^, as would make
Their practices, the more success to t^ke;
And that their natural means had hallowed bin,
With so much Fait^, and penitence* for sin,
As might have brought more works of Piety,
To san^tifie their outward Poluy
For those dull N^turalists, who think, this Foe,
Does by mere nat'^all causes* come o^ go,
Are much deceived* Yea, in their he^rts, they say,
There is no God, how ^ver gl^ze they may:
And as their cogitation^ are unholy,
So is their seeming wisdom* sottish folly.
They are the base Conjunctions, and Aspects
Of Sin, that this our Climate, so infects;
And neither Constellations, nor the Weather:
For, then we had been po^s'ned all together,
By this Contagion; and had breathed the longer
Or shorter while, as nature had been stronger,
Or weaker in us Nothing had been free,
But birds and beasts had died as well a^ we;
And this Disease had seized on every Creature
Or more or less, as it partakes our nature:
It was no n^ysome Air, no ^ewre, or Stink,
Which brought this Death, as most among us think,
For, then those places where ill smells abound,
Had more infectious at that time been found,
Then we perceive they were; yea, this Disease,
On every person delicate, would seize,
Without exception. And where Savours ill
Still bide, the Plague should there continue still:
Then, if they brought the same, they sure feed it,
And, keep it always there, as well as breed it.
Which God ^orbid; and ^each us to discern
His providence, and what thereby to learn.
Vain thoughts have also they, who credit can
That, this Infirmity, at first, began,
By means of populousness. For, were it so;
Some Courts and Allies, many years ago,
Had been infected: And, th^se places, where
Thronged up together, greatest numbers are;
From Visitation, had not free remained,
When open Streets, and Borroughs have complained*
And, let them not believe their fallacy,
Because great Cities, have most frequently,
This fearful Sickness, or, afflicted be,
When little Towns and Villages, are free.
For, as there is in great and popular places,
More sin, and more abundance of Gods graces:
So, it is just* that thither should be sent
The greater measure of his Chastisement,
That so, their eminen^e, might show abroad,
As well the Justice, as the Love of God;
Whose Judgments being laid on Towns obscure,
Might small respect, and less effect procure.
As ignorant as these, I reckon those,
Who this Disease, infectious do suppose
To every one: and, them, who credit not
That Sickness, by infection may be got:
For, these opinions can have no defense;
Since both will false be found, in common sense.
For, if we say, this Plague infects not any,
How comes it, we daily see so many
Consumed beneath one roof in little space?
How comes it, that it creeps from place to place,
So orderly, as oftentimes we see,
In some close Lane o^ Street? How may it be
That twenty Villages (far distant from
Infected Places) tainted should become
Within some few days after their arriving
Who in contageous places had their living?
None being there, before they came, infected,
Nor any such disease neare-hand suspected?
How comes all this, unless the Malad^e,
Has in it self, as had the L^prosie,
A spreading Nature, and envenomed that
Which of her poison can participate?
Believe it; as the Violet, or Rose,
(With pure and pleasing sweetness) where it grow^s
Perfumes the Air, and sends Odours out,
Which keep a certain distance there-about;
And, more or less, affect the Passers-by,
As they have more or less capacity
In smelling them; Or, as the calmed air,
Is either, more or less, corrupt or fair:
Right so, this Plague, even naturally affects
A space of Air about it; and infects,
(At such or such a distance) every one,
As he has weaknesses, to work upon:
Unless, that her malignitie be staid
By natural means, or power Divine alaid.
And yet, a false Position make they shall
Who thence infer, the Plague infecteth all,
Who breathe her tainted Air. For, how did they
Escape it ^hen, who long time, night and day
In places of infection were detained?
And in the bosom of this Pest ^emain'd,
Even where they often had their ears and eyes,
Affronted, by the sad aspect, and cries,
Of Death and Dying men? How escaped he
That in the Church, obliged was to be
Among infectious people; and to speak
Till tired were his lungs; and spirits weak?
Even when the peoples, thronging, and their heat
Did vapor up their breathings, and their sweat
For him to swallow? What preserved the Clerks,
The Sextens, Searchers, Keepers, and those Sharks,
The shameless Bearers? (who were nigh become,
A rout too bad, to pick out hangmen, from?)
How escaped the Surgeon, that often puts his head
Within the steame of an Infectious bed*
And, every day does handle, search, and dress,
Those Biles, that overflow with rottenness?
Or (which is more) how escaped those Babes, the Pest,
That were not only weak, but sucked the breast
Of Mothers deadly sick, when they did wear
Those noisome Blaines, that most infectious are?
This often chances. Yea, this has been seen
When on the very breast, the sore has been.
Nay, I have heard (by credible relation)
That near to Stra^ford-bow, this Visitation,
A little Infant was preserved alive,
Who sucked on the dying breasts of five.
How this may be I know not; If I shall
Conclude with some, this Plague has power on al^
Nor can I find a reason how it stinted,
Or how our total ruin was prevented.
For, when it was at height; and when appeared,
Most causes, that Infection should be feared;
Then, no man was confined, as before:
No Bill, or Cross, was fixed on any door;
We visited the Sick; we shunned neither
The place nor person; but met all together.
Yet then, and (let us mark it) not till then,
This Plague, her fury did abate again;
And constantly abate, though most refused
To keep such Orders, as at first were used.
Which manifest^th well, that (howsoever
Malignant in it self, the ^est appear)
Gods hand restraines it; many a man protecting
Immediately: some, mediately directing
To such, or such a means of preservation,
That they might honor him in their salvation*
And, as he strikes some, that men might fear
His Justice: So, he other some does spare,
That they might love his Mercies; and perceive
That he can at his pleasure take, and leave.
For, if God saved none; some Athe'st, would not
Make doubt, perhaps, to publish that he could not;
And, scarce one man would be so neighbourly,
To help his brother in this malady.
Which Charity to further (and to show
How safely, men their Callings may pursue
In every danger) we have had, this year,
Of Gods great Providence, fair token, here.
For, it is observed, that he has few destroyed
Who were in this mortality employed
About those Offices, which have to us
(In common sense) appeared most dangerous.
Few Sextons, and few Surgeons have miscari'd,
Who in their callings at this want have tary'd.
And of those Market-folks* who at our need
Brought in provisions, this weak place to feed,
I cannot hear of one, who did become
Infected; or, who brought infection home.
Even in that Parish where I did abi^e;
And where, nigh half a thousand, weekly died)
Not one of all that number perished,
That were the common Bearers of the Dead.
But, though from midnight, till the break of day,
They did infectious Ca^kasses convay
From sickly Dwellings, to those Pits of Death,
Which breathed out a most contagious breath,
With life and health, their service, God rewarded;
Even though the most of them naught else regarded,
But that base gain which might their want supply,
Or feed them in some wicked vanity.
How then, can we, that of this favor hear,
From any lawful action fly through fear?
Or doubt of Gods protection, when we make
A dangerous attempt, for conscience sake?
And know, beside, that what we ^^rive to do,
We are both called, and obliged unto?
Moreover, since the latter sort here named,
Are (for the greater part) in life defamed;
Such, who their needful Offices abused;
Such, who nor outward means, nor inward used;
To keep their healths (but, grew the bolder in
The practices of every kind of sin)
Such, whom Gods Judgments stupefied more,
And made far harder hearted, then before.
Since those (I say) of such condition were,
And yet preserved in their Callings, here:
For what good use I pray can we suppose
Those men were so preserved; but that those
Who truly seek Gods glory in their stay,
Might have the more assurance in their way?
And know, that if to such God please to give
This mortal life, they shall much rather live;
Or else (which is far better) if they dye,
Obtain a life, with immortality.
Some Wiseman-woud-be, now, perhaps, will prate
That this is Claphamnisme: And, that the State
(In her good policies to stop the breach
Of this great Plague) is wronged by what I teach?
But, rather they injurious are to me
Who so affirm; and vain their cavils be.
For, though to show the power Divine the more,
Our Muse declares, by what is gone before,
That Gods own hand, our City did preserve,
When we scarce Mea^es, or Order, did observe.
Let no man gather thence, that we maintain,
All Mean^s* or Civil Orders to be vain.
For, of selfe-murther that man guilty dies,
Who, means of health does wilfully despise.
Yea, doubtl^sse, there belongs a curse to them,
That orderly proceedings do contemn.
And, whereas we our Orders did transgress,
It was necessity, not wilfulness,
That u^ged it; because, our common woe,
Did far^^ beyond the power o^ O^d^r, go.
At rising of the ^loud we made a Bay;
But, at the height, it carried all away.
In humane Policy, we s^w no hope.
But, as the stones and Timbers which do stop
A Breach at first; when all is drowned over,
Do nothing else, but make the waters rore:
So, when our Sickness, and our Poverty,
Had greater wants than we could well supply,
Strict Orders did but more enrage our grief,
And, hinder in accomplishing relief.
Had every house been locked which we supposed
To stand infected, few had been unclos'd,
Yea, our first Orders had we still observed,
The healthie Households would not half have served
To keep the Sick. And who should then have heeded
Our private cares? Or got us that we needed?
As long as from each other, we ref^ain'd,
We greater sorrows every day sustained:
Yea, whilst for none, but for ou^ selves we cared,
Our brethren perished, and the worse we fared.
This made us from our Policies appeal,
And meet in Love, each others wounds to he^le.
This, made us from our civil Orders fly,
To make more practice of our Charity.
And hereunto, pe^haps, compelled were we,
By mere necessity, to let us see
Experiments, of that unmatched good,
Which flowe^h from a Christian Neighbourh^od*
And learn what public, and what pr^vate case
It brings in a g^nerall Dise^se:
And how it may a Commonwealth sustain
When carnal Wisdom, and Self-love are vain*
O^, we perchance from vulgar helps were driven,
Lest Overmuch assurance might be given
To outward means: Or, lest we used them so,
As if Gods power were chained thereunto.
O^ else, it was permitted, to d^clare
That fruitless all our best endeavors are.
Without his blessing: That, no creatures have
A Virtue to preserve till he will save:
That, his immediate power must countermand,
When any Plague has got an upper hand:
And, that, such Mercy shown in such distress,
Might bind us to the greater thankfulness.
But, lest what here precedeth has not shown
My purpose fully; be it also known,
That to restrain, or spur the PESTILENCE,
There is both supernat'rall Providence
And Causes natural. The first of these
Can work without the later, if it please.
The later cannot any thing effect,
But, as the former shall the same direct.
And, though in every sickness, thus it is,
Yet, such hid properties are found in this,
Such oppositions in the Natural Causes,
Such knots, and riddles; that it much amazes
The natural man: because he seldom finds
(As he perceives in griefs of other kinds)
The Causes and Effects agree together;
For, there is much uncertainty in either.
On some, this Plague does steal insensib^y,
Their muddy nature, stirring secretly
To their destruction. Some, it strikes so,
As if a mortal hand had with a blow
Arrested them; and on their flesh has seen
A palms impression, to appearance, been.
One m^n is faint, weak, sickly, full of fear,
And draws his breath where st^ongst infections are,
Yet scapes with life. Another man is young,
Light-hearted, healthy, stout, well-tempered, strong,
And lives in wholesome air, yet gets a fit
Of this Land Cale^ture, and dies of it.
Some are tormented by it, till we s^e
Their veins and sinews almost broken be,
The very soul distracted, sense bereft,
And scarce the smallest hope of scaping le^t,
Yet soon recover. Othersome, again
Fall suddenly; or feel so little pain
When they are seized, that they breathless lie,
E're any dying Symptoms, we ^spy.
On some, an endless drowsinesse does creep^:
Some others, cannot get one wink of sleep.
This, uses every day preservatives,
Yet dies: another takes none, yet lives.
Even thus uncertainly this Sickness plays;
Spares, wounds, and kills, many several ways.
From this experience, let us not conclude,
As many do among the multitude,
Who misconceiving (to no small offense)
The doctrine of Eternal Providence,
(Who from the truth of sober knowledge wandering,
And Gods Decrees, and Justice also slandring)
Do so necessitate the Fate of man,
That, whatsoever he endeavor can,
His pains is lost; and that foredoom'd, he must
At this or that set moment turn to dust:
And that no industry, no innocence,
No wilful carelessness, or foul offense,
N^r any humane actions helpful be
To life or death, but merely Gods De^ree.
Even such there be. And, howsoever they
Preach Faith, or Works, in show, yet, they denay
The power of both; and secretly maintain,
(By consequence at least) that means are vain.
For, they affirm that every thing men do,
They are by God predestined to
Before all worlds; So, that our power, or will,
Affects; not effects good, or ill;
And that we are by doom inevi^able
In every kind of action made unable.
Which Tenet, seems rather to arise
From those, who write of heathnish Des^inies,
Then from a Christian. For, though true it be,
That, God Almighty, all things does foresee,
And order so, and so dispose of things,
That, to perfection his own work he brings,
In spite of Satan, and of every deed
That may from his malignant brood proceed:
Yet, they have Actions naturally their own,
Which God permits. He likewise has bestowne
On us that are his children, grace, and powers,
Good Actions to perform, which we call ours
By Gods free gift. Moreover, he does please
To promise bliss, or threaten plagues, for these,
According to their natures; that each one
May heed the be^ter, what is to be done:
Be stirred up to put good works in use,
Or else be left at last without excuse.
For* though I am assured we possess,
By Nature, no inherent Righteousness;
I, naithelesse believe that every one
(Whose being, first, from Adams loins begun)
Received since our Universal fall
One Talent, at the least, to work withal,
With so much power of working also, that
We may and should with God cooperate.
As Adam all men did of life deprive;
Even so by Christ, were all men made alive:
Yea, even as Moses did not let remain
One hoof in Egypt which did appe^taine
To Isr'ell; So believe I that not one*
Was left unransom'd by Gods only Son:
But that all through the sea of blood d^d come,
As well those other who do wander from
Truths path in this life's wilderness; as they
Who come within the Land of Promise may.
And, though like him, who impudently, laid
Injustice to his Masters charge, and said;
He reaped where he sowed not, though, I say;
There want not some among us, at this day,
Who like to him, do most unthankfully
This grace of God in JESUS CHRIST deny;
(Affirming, that he some injoynes unto
Much more, than he did give them power to)
Our Maker unto every soul that lives,
So much by virtue of Christ's Passion gives,
That whosoever falls, fal^s not by
Another, but his own iniquity;
And, by his actual crimes, makes unforgiven
That Debt original which was made even
By his Redeemer, who, that, back will have,
(If we abuse it) which at first he gave.
Who ever wants power to do what God does bid,
Lost in himself, that pow^e as Adam did:
Yet, we that have it, neither had that power,
No^ keep it can, by any strength of our;
But by his holy Spirit, who has taught
That path of life wherein to walk we ought.
And, this is such a Mystery, that some
Which think they s^e, are blind therein become*
Our guilty Souls and Bodies were bereft
Of all good Faculties, and had not left
So much as Will, much less the power to do
What soul or B^d^es health conduced to.
Their guilt Christ from them took; and by his might
Depraved Nature so much sets to right,
That unto every Soul, he gives the will
Which Adam had, of choosing good or ill.
And then both Life and Death, he does propose
Before them so, that either may be chose.
To them, whom in his Church he does afford
To live past Childhood, He does by his Word
(And by no other means) this tender make.
With Infants, and with Heathens, he may take
Some other course. But, surely, when, or how
He that effects; concerns not us to know.
When God does make this tender (which is then
When he does please, and no man knows when)
If any Soul by Satan's guile does choose,
What Gods good Spirit moves her to refuse,
She, then, to put in action does begin
The heinous and impardonable sin
Against the Holy Ghost (which f^arfull crime
Is made apparent to the world, in time,
Or more or less, by outward actions here,
As God shall please to let the same appear)
And, after this refusal, every thing,
Which does increase of grace, to others, bring,
Does make her grow more senseless of her state,
Or else enrage, or make her desperate.
And, her freewill, in Adam lost before,
Is lost again, by her, for evermore.
But, if she chooses as the Spirit move^h,
The Lord, this Soul, without repenting loves;
In her, preserving such affections still,
And such a portion of her first Freewill,
That though the frailties of her flesh do seem
To choke them often, in the worlds esteem;
(And sometime in her own) yet she for ever
Does in her motion toward God persever,
Till she arive in him. Nor does she cease
Of pious works, her number to increase:
But labors for assurance in election,
By reaching every day at more perfection.
An^, far is it from God to take away
The guerdon of our Faith; or to denay
What he did by his Covenant, ordain,
To be the wages of our Christian pain:
Or to command us what should profit naught;
Or, to neglect the works that we have wrought.
For, since God heeds those things that are so small,
As birds alightings, and as hairs that fall;
Makes use of every circumstance, and chai^es
(To further those maine ends which he ordaines)
Ten thousand little trifling things together;
Not one omitting, none displacing neither,
Which may be pertinent his ends to fu^ther,
Or to effect them, in their timely Order.
How could so fond a crotchet be devised,
That God our serioust actions has despised?
Or, that by his Foreknowledge, or Decree,
Our deeds should all annihilated be?
Or, that he should so often incite us to
What he had given to man, no power to do?
I dare not venture upon their distractions,
Who search the order of Eternal actions;
Nor do I further seek what God foreknowes,
Then he within his Word revealed shows;
Nor will I ever strive to pry into
His hidden couns^lls, as too many do:
But their unwarrantable paths eschewing,
And, Gods disclosed purposes pursuing,
Search only for the knowledge of those things
Which an effecting of his pleasure brings.
Since, if I follow them, it cannot be
That he would purpose any harm to me;
Or in his secret counsel ought ordain
To make his publi^e will to be in vain.
For, though, when Abram, Isa'k thought to kill,
God's hidden purpose, and revealed will
Did seem to cross each other (And when he
Did threaten Niniveh destroyed should be)
Yet, they appear not opposite to those
Whose faith, such holy secrets can disclose.
Or were it so; from acts particular
None should conclusions general infer.
God never said, as yet, that I could hear,
Man, such a day shall perish, howsoever
By faithful works for safety he endeavor.
But, all his promises and threatenings, ever
Were made conditional; and have fore-spoken
Our life, or death, as they are kept, or broken.
Nor is this any bar, or contradiction
To Gods free Grace; or to his firm Election,
Or never-ending Love. Nor helps it those
Who, perseverance of the Saints, oppose:
But, rather, makes all those Doctrines good.
Yea, being rightly weighed and understood,
Gods justice, and his mercy it unites,
Whom men's blind Cavills have made opposites.
God knew the doom, and date of Adams crime,
Yet, he did fore-expresse no certain time;
But, speaking of it, spoke indefinitely,
And said, That d^y thou sinnest, thou shall dye.
And sure, of all men's deaths (who e're gain says)
It is their sin that sets down the days.
For, till transgression forfeited our breath,
There was no peremptory day of death.
And, in affirming, where Gods Word is mute,
It is presumption, to be absolute.
Do this, says God, and live; Do that and perish.
Yet some, whose overfights too many cherish,
Dare contradict it; and affirm that we
Good, bad, dead, living, damned, saved be
Even from eternity, without respects,
To any causes, or to their effects.
And these imply, that (whatsoever we do,
Or leave undone) God fore-appoints us to
A certain doom; which we shall strive in vain,
With all our strength, to shun* or to obtain.
And wherefore then did God his Gospel send?
Why does his Word exhort us to amend?
Why does he ^id us, this, or that to shun?
Why has he charged some things to be done?
If he no power has given, or else by fate
Disableth all men to cooperate?
And leaves them neither good nor ill to do
But what he fore-decreed long ago?
Why threats he stripes? why promises reward?
If there be no compassion, no regard,
Nor meed for what is done. And what I pray
Is all Religion, if these truth do say?
I know God reprobates* and does foresee
Before all worlds, who reprobates will be.
But, none he forces to be so accursed,
Save those who have his Grace rejected first*
And unto those, indeed, he power denies
To work his will, because they did despise
His proffered Love; And just it is in him,
To make them blind, who did the light contemn.
He does eternally abhor the crime;
But he the persons reprobates in time.
And None does choose, or personally reject
(What ever some conceive) but with respect
Unto his Covenant; which has implide
Something to be performed on either side.
For, were it so, that God has fore-decreed
What should befall unto us without heed
To any Covenant; and barred Salvation,
By an eternal doom of R^probation,
(In such like manner as the fantasies
Of some (not well advisedly) devise)
What compass we by striving therewithal*
Why spend we time, in rising up to fall?
Why linger we to act so many crimes?
To suffer over grief so many times?
And live so many several deaths to taste,
To be nor worse, nor better at the last?
Or wherefore have we prayed, since we know
What must be, must be, though we pray not so?
I might be thought over bitter, if as they
I should interrogate, who sharply say;
Why do not these, who this opinion hold,
Go hang themselves before that they are old?
Or in their Gardens, TIMON like, erect
Fair Gibbets for the Scholars of their Sect?
What tends their life unto? why should not they
Refuse to eat and drink; and, wisely, say,
"God, for our end, a certain day has set,
"Which we shall reach, although we taste no meat.
Why do they shun a danger in the street,
Since they shall live their time, what e're they meet?
If they to any place, desire to go,
Why trouble they their feet to help thereto?
Since they are sure, that if decreed it were
They should come thither, they their pains may spare?
If thus I should have said, some men would deem me
To be more bitter then did well beseem me:
For, I confess that on the quick they grated,
Who in this manner have expostulated.
And I forbear it. Yet, this generation
Has some who need this tart expostulation;
With whom loud noises more prevail by far,
Then do those proofs, that Faiths and Reasons are.
I know to these Objections, most replies;
I know their strength, and where their weakness lies;
I know what holy Scriptures, men mistake,
Which proofs of their assertions seem to make:
I know, how they their Arguments mis-lay,
From that of Esau, and the Potters clay:
I know what Times and Terms they misconceive,
And wherewithal themselves they do deceive.
I know with what nicknames of heresy,
Some Readers will for this my Muse belie;
And that nor they, who called Armini^ns be,
Nor they who reprehend them, will with me
Be friends for this; for neither those nor these
Am I desirous to offend or please.
But to uphold the Truth, which is belied*
Injuriously by most of either side.
I know their spite, their vinegar, their gall;
I know what spirit most are led withal
Who spread the Doctrines which I have reproved,
And know such Reason nev^r to be moved,
With favor to them that I dare to say,
It is the nearest and the straightest way
To all profaneness. It the b^idle gives
To ^arnall liberties, and makes the lives
And hearts of many men so void of care:
From hence distractions; hence despairings are.
Hence mischiefs; hence self murders do arise;
Hence is it that such multitudes despise
Good discipline: yea, this contemned makes
The life of Faith, if once it rooting takes:
Disableth pious practices outright*
And where it roots, destroys Religion quite.
Let no man then admit into his thought,
That God Almighty has decreed ought
Which on his Justice may infringement bring,
Or on his Mercy in the smallest thing:
Or that his Wisdom any thing ordaines
Without the means which thereunto pertaines:
Or think, because our sin he does permit
That therefore he necessitateth it:
Or that he wills those errors he foresees,
As he the works of righteousness decrees:
Or, that our humane actions cyphe^s are:
Or, that within this world there ever were
Or shall, those persons be, whom God will call
Unto account, until he give them shall,
At least, one Talent, which may serve unto
The working of that work he bids them do.
Let no man dream these dreams; nor censure this,
Till he has well considered what that is
Which I deliver. For in this dark way,
Our learned Clerks do sometimes run astray.
Nor let them think that I concur with all,
Who in appearance hold this Tenet shall:
Or that I differ from all men that may
In terms dissent from what I seem to say.
For they that in expression disagree
In one well-meaning, often united be.
And either (if that they in love contend)
Shall then at length, obtain their wished end.
Oh! labor this, all you that would be thought
GODS glory in your studies to have sought;
That though offenses come, they may not move
Disunion; but Gods worthy ones approve.
And let us with a true sobriety,
So heed his Actions of eternity,
That we may see in them a boundlesnesse,
Beyond our humane wisdom to express;
Leave quarrelling about his ways unknown,
And take more heed here after to our own.
For, though God pleases, other while, to use
Our vulgar Terms, some notions to infuse
Of his eternal workings, and apply
His deeds that way, to our capacity,
Disclosing them unto us one by one,
As if at several times they had been done,
(Because our shallowness no means can find
To entertain them in their proper kind)
And though (respecting us who temp'ral be)
We say, that God Almighty does fores^e,
Foreknow us, and pr^destinate; yet sure,
His Essence no such terms can well endure
In proper sense; Because with him, no doom,
Word, Thought, or Act, is passed, or to come.
But all things present. Yea, all Times, and all
Those things which we by several names do call,
Our Birth^, our Lives, our Deaths, and our Saluations,
Our free-el^ctions, and pr^d^stinations,
Are all at once with God, without foreseeing;
Even all in one-eternall-present-being.
Which few observing, many men have thought
That Gods et^rnall actions should be wrought
Like ours in Time, which is, as if they should
Endeavor how the world they might enfold
Within a Nut-shell. And while thus men strive
(According to their fancies) to contrive
An order in Gods Workings, they mistake them
Blasphemously, and orderlesse do make them.
Yea, to define his actions, they neglect
That part which is their duty to effect;
Themselves and others losing in a path
Which neither profit, end, nor safety has;
And, by disputing what from us is hidden,
Disturb the doing that which God has bidden:
I have digrest enough; and some there are
Who think, perhaps, that I have gone too far.
Yet, let it not be judged impertinent,
That I have so pursued this Argument.
For, want of minding what is here rehearsed,
Has often times the Pestilence dispersed.
Yea, some who fondly said, that every man
Shall live his time decreed, do what he can;
And that each one at his fixed hour shall dye,
Against which he seeks in vain, a remedy:
Even these, made much good means of health neglected*
Much wise and wholesome counsel be rejected;
And caused, often, in this our common woe,
That Death was brought and carried, to and fro.
But, lest in chasing them, I run astray;
I Will prosecute again my purposed way.
The Pestilence does show her self inclined
So variously, she cannot be defined.
She neither certain form, nor habit wears,
But, partly metaphysicall appears,
And partly natural. She often may carry
Her Progress on, by means that is ordinary;
But, rarely does begin, or end her Arrant,
Save by an extraordinary Warrant.
It does infect, and it infecteth not.
It is an arrow which is often shot
By Gods own hand, from his far-striking bow*
Without the help of any means below.
It is Gods Angel, which to death can smite,
Miraculously, an army in a night.
It is a rational Disease, which can
Pick, with discretion, here and there a man;
And pass over those, who either marked are
For Mercy; or, a greater Plague to bear.
We see, it suting has to Natures laws,
A natural motion, and a natural cause;
For, as a Fire among great Buildings thrown,
Burns ^imber, melts Metal, cracketh Stone,
Defaceth Statues, makes moist places dry,
The Vaults below to sweat, the tyles to fly
And manifests his force, in several kinds,
According to the objects which he finds:
So, has the Pestilence a natural power
To ha^den, fright, end^nger, or devou^e,
(And diverse other changes to procu^e)
As she does find a several temp'rature
In mind or body, fitting the rejection.
Or for the entertainment of Infection.
These things considered. They who shall desire
To escape from this Contagion, must acquire
A double Ward* For, doubtless, there is none
That can resist it with one guard alone.
In times of Danger, vainly we presume
Upon our Iv'^y boxes of Perfume.
To little purpose, we defend our noses,
With Wormwood, Rue, or with our Radeliffe Posies
Of tarred Ropes. Small warrant for our lives,
Are all such bodily Preservatives,
As Cordial waters, Gums, Herbs, Plants, and Roots,
Our simple or compounded Antidotes.
Our Boezar-stone; our medicines Chymicall;
Or, that high-p^ized Jewel wherewithal,
For horn of V^icorne, men cheated are:
Or, those unhallowed Charms, which many wear.
For, these are far unable to withstand
The vigor of his incorporeall hand,
Who strikes for sin, unless to these we add
A Plaster which of better things is made.
Yea Nature fails, unless adjoyne we do,
A medicine metaphisicall thereto.
Moreover, fruitlesly devout are they,
And that they seek to God they falsely say,
Who wilfully neglect, or else contemn,
That outward means, which Nature offers them,
And God provides, to cure, or to prevent,
The mischief of Diseases pestilent.
For, since we framed of souls and bodies are,
God pleased is, that we should have a care
To both of them; and labor how to find,
What appertains to either, in his kind.
He therefore, who desires a defense
Against this Arrow of the Pestilence;
A complete Armor must from God procure,
And still be armed, his person to secure.
He must put on the Helmet of Salvation,
And shoe his feet with holy Preparation.
A Bel^ of Truth must for his loins be sought;
His Breast Plate must of Righteousness be wrought.
The Shield of Faith, his Target must become,
The darts of Satan to secure him from.
Gods Word must be the Sword upon his thigh,
His Prayers, like continual shot must fly;
And he should keep for ever his abode,
Within the shadow of Almighty God.
Or else the Workman loses all his pain;
And he that watches, wake^h but in vain.
He also must expel out of the soul,
That filthiness of sin, which makes it foul.
He must avoid the crimes he lived in;
His Physi^ke must be Rue (even Rue for sin)
Of Herb of Grace, a Cordial he must make;
The bitter Cup of true Repentance take;
The Diet of Sobriety assume;
His House with works of Charity perfume;
And watch, that from his heart in secrecy,
Arise no savours of Hypocrisy.
He must believe, God so does love him, that
His everlasting good, is aimed at
In all he suffers; and, that, God does know,
And mark his nature, and his temper so,
As that he will impose nor more, nor less,
Than shall be needful for his happiness.
For, such a Faith, will keep him still content,
Still lowly, under every cha^tisement;
Still thankful, whatsoever does befall;
And Blessings make, of what we Plagues do call.
He must, moreover with a holy Fear,
In all his Christian duties pe^severe;
Still watchful, and at no time daring ought
Which may from God divert him in a thought:
(So near as possibly, the power of man,
So great a diligence endeavor can.)
For, round about him are a thousand Fears,
A thousand Dangers, and ten thousand Snares,
And, as a Traveller, who for his Bridges,
To pass deep waters, having naught but ridges
Of narrow Timbers, dares not cast his eye
From off the Plancke, nor set his foot a wrie;
because beneath him, he beholds a Stream,
That runs, and roares, and gapes to swallow him:
So, he that must an hourly passage make,
Through such like Plagues, as this whereof I speak,
(And many dangers waiting on him has,
To catch him, if he slip his narrow Path)
Had need be careful that he never stray,
Nor swarve in any thing beside the way.
Let, therefore, every man desire, at least*
This power; that his desirings may be blessed,
With such pe^formances as he shall need,
Or, have his Will accepted for the Deed.
And, let him to his Calling ever stand:
For, whosoever does leave that place unmann'd
Wherein God set him; ^orfeits that reward
(And is d^prived of that Angel guard)
Of which his Muse does prophecy, who says,
We shall pr^s^rved be in all our ways.
Far is it from my nature, to reprove
With proud insultings, those whom fear did move
To step aside: For, good and pious men
Give way to natural frailties now and then;
And, we whom God emboldned now to stay,
Hereafter, from less frights may run away.
Yea, sure I am, that if it do not flow
From Love, and Pity, that their s^apes we show,
God may, and will (our folly to deride)
Make them dare stand, where we shall sear to bide.
And therefore, hoping none amiss will take
What I have writ for truth and con^^ience sake;
(That men in times to come might look into
This duty, and be heedfull what they do)
I will affirm, that every one has erred,
Who in his lawful Calling, was deterred
So much, as in ^his danger to forsake it:
And, though a trifling matter many make it,
I know, the most apparent shows of terror
Are not excuse enough for such an error.
For, that we should not in such cases dread
The greatest perils: God has promised,
That if we keep ou^ ways, and him obse^ve,
He will not only, from this Plague preserve;
But, cause us without ha^me to walk among,
Even Adders, Drago^s, Lions old and young:
By which pernicious creatures, and untamed,
Is ev'^y danger meant that can be named.
These things we must obse^ve, if we will hope
Gods extraordinary blow to stop;
And other circumstances must attend
Those means. But, they so nat'rally depend
On what precedes; that in well doing one,
We cannot leave the other part undone.
Such were those holy medicines, which prevented
The Plague, at Niniveh, when she repented;
Such Israel used, and it saved them;
Such kept the Plague out of Jerusalem;
And when the bloody Angel came, had power
To stop him in Araunab's threshing floor.
Thus Hezekiah was preserved; thus David
Was from the very same contagion saved:
And if unfainedly we pra^tise thus,
He does of safety also warrant us.
Yea (through this means) we shall be fortified
With such a coat of proof, as will abide
That murdering Arrow which in darkn^sse flies,
From God^ own Bow, unseene of mortal eyes.
And when we thus have done, attempt we may
To stop the Shaft, that flies abroad by day;
I mean the natural Sickness, which does smite
By means, that is appar^nt to the sight.
For, as God strikes, often, immediate blows
By some immediate way: right so he shows
A natural cure to those, whom he does please
To warrant from the natural Diseas^*
Thus, he for Hezekiah's health revealed
That Plaster, wherewithal his grief was healed,
Thus from this Plague have many been secured,
And many saved, who the stroke endured.
Here I could show, what Med^cines may be took
To cure or to prevent the outward stroke;
To qualify the Air, what might be used;
What Diet should be taken, what refused;
What Symptoms do attend on this disease;
What good, or ill, from Labor, or from Ease
Too much, or over-little, may be got:
But, to proceed in this presume I not,
For, to prescribe external medicines, here
To every man, too hard a task it were;
Since they must often changed and mixed, ^e,
As we the sickness changeable do see,
And as we find the measure of infection,
The parties Age, his Temper, or Complexion.
To those I therefore will commit this part,
Who are allowed professors of that Art;
Advising all, that none their aid refuse,
Nor out of season, their assistance use.
For, if, before our peace with God be made,
We (seeking outward means) a cure have had;
That means shall be the means our death to ^et:
That cure shall only cure us, to beget
Another Plague: unless we have repented
Our solly, and the mis^hiefe, so, prevented.
Yea such, as take that course, do sugar over
Strong poy^ons, and skin up a festring sore;
Because those medicines, and that watchfuln^sse
(From which they did expect a good succes^e)
Not being with repentance sanctified,
Nor (in their place) with faithfulness applied,
Corruptd grow; make what was evil, worse;
And (in the stead of blessings) bring a curse.
This Reason proves, For, since it is from Sin
Whence all our griefs, and sicknesses have bin:
We shall as vainly strive the effects to stay,
Till we the Causes first remove away,
As if we went about to draine a River,
Before to stop the Springs we did endeavor.
And, as we neither should over much r^ly
On outward helps; nor take disorderly
The means of Health; ^ight so, beware we must
That we do never use it with distrust.
For as, in seeking safety, most men use
Preposterous courses (whence much harm ensues)
Or else (when likely med'^ines they have got)
Presume so far, on what availe^h not,
Without Gods blessing; that, from him they take
His due, and of his Creatures, Idols make:
So, some there be so fearful, that their Fear
Corrupts their blood, where no infections were;
Begets that Plague within them which they shun;
And makes it follow, when they from it run.
No place, or counsel can of rest ^ss^re them;
No means their hope of safety can procure them:
But still they are distempered; ever taking
New courses, and new Medicines always making.
Of all they meet (if any meet they dare)
For some Receipt, their first enquiries are.
What e're he be that tells them, that, or this
Prevents the Plague; it straightwayes practiced is.
They swallow down hot Wa^^rs, Sirrups, Drinks,
Choke up their Chambers wit^ Perfumes, and Stinks;
With Rue, and Wormwood cram their bowels up,
With Physic break their fa^ts, and dine, and su^:
Yet, still d^spaire, as if that world of sluffe
(Which they devoured) were not half enough.
And, this their terror, does to me appear,
A greater Plague, then that which they do fear.
Mistake me not; I do not here condemn
The christian, and the filial fear of them,
That are (with holy dread) employed about
Such means, as wo^keth true salvation out.
Nor blame it, when a moderate fear does make
Alarums in us, Reason to awake.
For, while our Fear preserves a moderation,
It is a very necessary passion,
And stands for Centinell, to bid us Arm,
When any Foe does seem to menace harm.
Nor do I check that natural Fear, which from
The knowledge of our weaknesses does come:
For, want of that, is mere stupidity;
And such, can neither feel a Misery,
Nor ta^te Gods Mercies, with more profit, than
The brutish Creatures wanting Reason, can;
Who, of their pains, or pleasures, naught retain
Much longer, then it does in act remain.
I count not each man valiant, who dares die,
Or venture on a Mischief desperately,
When, either heat of Youth, or Wine, or Passion
Shall whet him on, before consideration:
For, thus a Beast will do, and has (no doubt)
As much foresight in what he goes about;
As those blind Bayards, who courageous be
In perils, whose events they do not see.
Nor will I any man a Coward call,
Although I see him tremble, and look pale
In dangerous attempts* unless he slack
His just Resolves, by basely stepping back.
For, as the greater part of men w^ find
To laugh and blush, by nature, much inclined:
So, many have a natural inclination,
To trembling, palenesse, or some other passion,
Which, no Philosophy can take away,
Nor any humane wit, or strength, allay:
And if their Apprehension proves better
Then other Men's; their Passions are the greater*
Because their searching wits find pe^ills out,
Whereof the Dullard (never having doubt)
Has boldly ventured on them, and out-dar'd,
Wh^t being heede^, him to death had scared.
Give me the Man, that with a quaking arm
Walks with a steadfast mind through greatest harm;
And though his flesh does tremble, makes it stand
To execute what Reason does command.
Give me the Soul, that knowingly descries
All dangers, and all possibilities
Of outward p^rills; and yet does persever
In every lawful action, howsoever.
Give me that Heart, which in it self does war
With many frailties (who li^e Traitors are
In some besieged Fort) and has to do
With outward Foes, and inward Terrors too;
Yet of himself, and them, a conquest makes,
And still proceeds in what he undertakes.
For, this is double- valor; and such men
(Althoug^ they are mis-censur'd now, and then)
Enjoy those minds that best composed are;
In lawful quarrels are without compare;
And (when the Coward, hoodwinked goes to fight)
Dare change their sternest Foes with open sight.
Let no Man therefore glory, or make boast
Of Courage, when they feel their Dread is lost,
Or think themseles the safer, when they find
Their Fear is gone, whilst Peril slayes behind;
Especially, when they besieged appear,
With such like Pl^gues, as this, we treat of here.
For that endangers, rather then secureth;
Since Custom, or else Ignorance procu^eth
That bru^ish ^earlesnesse: And, where we see
Such hardiness, Gods judgments fruitless be.
There is required, yet, one Caveat more
To perfect that, which has been said before;
Even this; that we grow watchful, lest the while
We trust in God, we do our selves beguile
With fruitless confidence, and on his grace
(Beyond his warrant) our assurance place.
For, many thousands wondrous forward are
In Gods large promises to claim a ^hare;
Who, those conditions never mused on,
Which he does ground his Covenant upon.
And as the Jews (from whom they take example)
Bragged of their outward worship, and their Temple,
As if Gods League extended unto all,
Who could themselves, the sons of Jacob, call,
Without respecting their partic'lar Way:
So, we have some among us, that will say,
They trust in God, and that, in this infection,
They full assurance have of his protection:
Because they formally his Truth profess;
Perform external works of Holiness;
Or visibly, with such, partakers are,
With whom the Pledges of Gods love appear.
But, they that on these ou^ward works rely,
Without true faith, and true sincerity;
Commit those gilded sins, whose gloss will wear,
And leave their na^urall corruptions bare:
Yea they, of their professions, idols make;
And, will the Covenant of God ^istake,
Until in his conveyances, they see
What duties, on their par^s, required be.
God promis^th (indeed) all such to save,
Who in his holy Church their dwelling have;
And that he will vouchsafe them his de^ence
From dangers of the noisome Pestilence:
But they must love him, and inuoke him, then,
Or else the Bargain is unmade again.
Thus much inferres the Psalmist, in that Ode,
Which p^ophecies the saving Grace of God.
Those, therefore, too too much on them assume,
Yea, (foolishly) of mercy they presume,
Who boast of Gods protection, and yet tread
Those paths, which to a sure destruction lead.
I do not mean, when any man mis^does
Through frailty, or unwillingly mis-goes:
But when, with liking, and without remorse,
He wilfully pursues a wicked Course.
For, such, their confidence on God, belly,
Depending on their own security;
And cannot see those dangers they are in,
Because their Consciences have seared bin.
How many thousands in the Grave are laid,
Who, in their life-times, impudently said
They should be safe in God? yet never took
His counsel, nor one vanity forsook
For love of him? How many have I heard
Presumptuously affirm, they never feared
The danger of Gods Arrows? though they flew
At n^one, at midnight, and so many slew
In every street? yea, shamelesly profess
Their trust in God, to cause their fearlesnesse,
Yet, nothing for the love of him ^ndevour?
How boldly have I seen them to pe^sever
In every ^in, when Gods fierce Angel stood,
Even just before them, all embru'd in blood;
And slaught'ring r^u^d about the^ neighbors, brothers
Their friends* their kinsme^, children, fathers, mothers,
And some of every sort? Nay, I have heard
Of such, who were not any jot afear'd
To ba^gaine for their Lust, in times to come,
Within the compass of the selfsame room,
Where (at that instant) they beheld their wives
Lie newly dead; or laboring for their lives.
They waste Gods Creatures in luxurious diet;
Consume their times in wantonness, and riot;
They feasts, and merriments, in Tavernes keep,
Whilst others in the Temples, fast, and weep;
They p^rsecute their brethren, and the poor;
Pe^forme no good; forbear no sin the more;
And live so carelessly, as if they thought,
That, when the greatest wickedness they wrought,
It proved, their trust in God to be the greater;
And, that lewd works, showed forth their faith the better;
Or else that God the more obligement had,
Because he was so good, and they so bad*
Even such there are. And these make boastings will,
Of ^rust in God, yet such continue still.
Alas, it is but vain to say Lord, Lord,
Or to profess a confidence in word,
Where lively Faith appears not: for, God grants
Protections unto none, but whom he planteth
Within his Vineyard; wherein grows no tree,
But in some measure, it will fruitful be;
Or ^lse, a storm shall come, which down will shake it,
With whatsoever, carnal props, we s^ake it.
No high-presuming Cedars, nor stiff Oaks,
Are those whom God exempteth from the strokes
Of his tempestuous wrath: but, that which bends
To every blast, which he in Judgment sends,
As does a bruised, or low-stooping Reed,
Which, by the bowing, is from breaking freed.
Yea those, who really within the shade
Of his defense, have their abidings made;
Those only, may depend on his protection,
Amid the ragings of this hot Infection.
And who are these, but such, as (when they see
The threa^ned Plague) afraid, and humbled be?
Such, as through hearty love, ashamed grow,
That they so good a God displeased so:
Such, as are sorry for their passed crimes,
And truly purpose, in all future times
A better life: Such, who, for conscience sake
(And not through servile fear) themselves betake
To pious exercises: such, who strive
To mortify their lusts, and how to live
As worthy their free-calling: such, as they,
Who every hour, do labor, watch, and pray*
Their duties to perform; and dare not peep
Abroad at morning, or at evening sleep,
Till they the sacrifice of thanks have paid,
For favors past; and begged for future aid.
Such, as on Gods own pleasure can rely,
And, in his Faith resolved are to dye.
Such, as have Charity; and working are
Their safeties with continual joy, and fear^*
Even such as these, securely may repose
When twenty thousand dangers them enclose.
On these, Gods Angels wait* and these they shall
From stumbling keep, when many Millions fall*
From every kind of harm they shall be free,
And sleep, where fears, and mischiefs thickest be:
Yea, though that seize them, which the Plague we call,
It shall to them become no Plague at all;
But rather be their furth'rance, to acquire
That perfect happiness, which they desire.
Let no man, therefore, in this Visitation
Tie God unto the temp'rall preservation;
Or be discouraged, if he shall please
To exercise him under this Disease,
Supposing, he inflicteth it on none
(As some fools think) but Reprobates alone.
For he did Hezekiah thereby strike*
He, by th^s Malady, or some such like,
Afflicted holy David, his Elected;
Whose Reprobation is of none suspected.
And though just men from temporal infection
Shall find more certainty of Gods protection,
Then others do: yet sure, that Pestilence
(From which God promised absolute defense)
Is not that sickness which the body slayes;
But that, which death unto the soul conveyes.
Our ^^rthly griefs, to heavenly joys do rear^,
And why should any Man or grudge or fear
A mortal wound, so he might gain thereby
A body clothed with immortality?
Or why should we repine, in missing that,
Which (to our damage) we had aimed at;
When God does give us more then we desired;
and lifts us higher, then our hopes aspired?
To him due praises, rather, let us give,
Whose love to us, is better, then to live.
But, I have said enough to this effect,
And if, what I have spoken, have re^pec^,
We shall (I hope) hereafter well dis^erne,
What, by this Judgment, we are bound to learn*
How much to trust; how much to hope, or fear;
What outward means, or inward helps there are,
Whereby, this heavy Plague may be prevented*
Or entertained, with a breast contented.
So few (as yet) have thus prepared bin,
That now of late it quickly rushed in
In spite of all our Halberds, and our Watches.
And as a Flame (which in a Tempest, catches
On some full Barn) is blown about the Village,
And fi^eth, here, the hopeful fruits of Tillage;
A Cottage there; on the other side the way
A well-^ill'd Stable, or a Rick^ of Hay;
Another yo^; close by, does menace harm
Even to the Church; forthwith consume ^ Farm;
Some dwellings (now, and then) does overgoe*
Anon la^es waste a dozen in a row;
And still increase, go forward, and return,
Until the Town in every quarter burn:
So raged the Pestilence. And, as we see
Those wo^kmen, who, repai^ing breaches b^
In Them, or Trent, at first the Banks do raise*
Shut clos^ the Sluce^, strengthen up the Bay's,
And l^bour seriously with much good hope,
While they perceive but some few gaps to stop:
But, when they see the Flood prevailing more,
(Ten breaches made, for ^v'ry one before)
And all endeavors fail; they work forsake,
Leaving the waters their own cours^ to take:
So, when this Flood began* we had ^ thought
To keep it back; and to that purpose w^ought:
But, when we saw it rise beyond our power,
We gave it way at pleasure to devour.
At first, the public Officers did show
Their skill in curbing this encroaching Foe,
Not sparing to be prodigal of pain,
The spreadings of Infection to restrain;
And every private family beside,
Against this danger did for arms provide*
Their Yards, and Halls, were smoked with perfume,
To stop the stinkes, which thither might presume.
Their Chambers furnished were with Antidotes,
With Viols, Boxes, Glasses, Gallipots,
All filled with munition of defense
(As they supposed) against the Pestilence.
Some did in Meats their means of safety think;
Some Epicures did arm themselves with Drink;
Some, foolishly did build up monstrous hope^
Upon the smoking of Tobacco shops;
(But this disease, without a Conscience making
Of their presuming on Tobacco taking,
Came thither too, and frequently did carry
Good-fellowes from their smoking Sanctuary.)
Some, one, and some another course devised*
Yet, every day more places were surprised.
Which, when we saw, and how it overcast
All temp'rall force; we thought upon (at last)
The help of God: and then we did repair
To crave his aid in Fasting, and in Prayer,
Then some, through servile terror; some, for fashion,
And some, out of a true humiliation,
Emplored aid from heaven; and showed in teare^
Their Hope, their true Repentance, and their Fears:
But, whether God did for a while contemn^
Ou^ suit, because we gave not ear to him,
When first he called: or, whether he thought fit,
(That we the longer might remember it)
To fright us somewhat more: or whether we
Brought not such hearty penitence, as he
Expected from us: or appointed were
Some further trials of our Faith to bear:
Sure, some such cause there was; and for that cause,
God did not only seem to make a pause
In answ'ring our Petition; but, to chide
More sharply, and to throw it quite aside.
For with a doubled, and redoubled stroke
The Plague went on; and, in (among us) broke
With such unequalled fury, and such rage;
As Brittan never felt in any age.
With some at every turning she did meet.
Of every Alley, every Lane and Street
She got possession: and we had no way,
Or passage, but she there, in Ambush, lay.
Through Nookes, and Corners, she pursued the Chase,
There was no barring her from any place:
For in the public Fields in wait she laid;
And into private Gardens was convaid.
Sometime, she did among our Garments hide;
And, so, disperse among us (unespy'd)
Her st^ong Infections. Otherwhile (unseene)
A Servant, Friend, or Child betrayed has been,
To bring it home; and men were fearful grown
To tarry, or converse, among their own.
Friends fled each other* Kinsmen stood aloof*
The Son, to come within his F^thers roof
Presumed not; the Mother was constrained
To let her child depart unentertain'd.
The love, betwixt the husband, and the wife,
Was often neglected, for the love of life;
And many a ^ne their promise falsifi'd,
Who vowed, that naught but death should the^ divide.
Some, to frequent the Markets were afraid;
And some to feed on what was thence purvay'd.
For on young pigs such purple spots were s^ene,
As marks of Death on Plague-sicke men have been*
And it appeared that our suburbe-Hogs
Were little better, then our Cats, and Dogs*
Men knew not, whither they might safely come,
Nor where to make appointments, nor with whom.
Nay, many shunned G^ds-house, and much did fear
So far to trust him, as to meet him there.
In brief, the Plague did such destruction threat,
And Fears, and Perils were become so great,
That most men's hearts did fail; and they to flight
B^^ooke themselves, with all the speed they might:
Not only they, who private persons were,
But, such as did the public Titles bear.
The Mayor startled, and some say was gone:
But, when his Charge he truly thought upon,
It settled him; and he at Helm did 'bide
Until his room was orderly supplied.
And (let me do him right) it since appeared,
That, with go^d Diligence his Course he steered.
For, on hi^ back were many burdens laid;
The Count^y of provisions us denay'd;
The greater part with sickness waxed froward;
Much want did make the poorer sort untoward;
That when I call to mind his heavy task,
And little help; me thinks it praise does ask.
Most of his gowned- Brethren him forsook,
And to their Country Bowers themselves be^ooke;
Where, how they prayed, or what they sent by gift,
To feed the Poor; I leave it to the shr^ft
Of their own consciences; which best can tell,
What things they have performed ill, or well.
Physicians were afraid, as well as these,
And neither Galen, nor Hippocrates
Could yield them any warrant for delay;
And therefore (with the first) they went away.
Some Leaches of the Soul, (who should have staid)
Were much (nay somewhat overmuch) afraid,
And had forgotten so, how to apply
Their heavenly Cordi^ls of Divinty,
Against the fear of ^eath; that when most dangers
Beset their Flocks; they left them unto strangers.
Nay* some there were, who did among us teach,
That Men should fly; and that, which they did preach,
They taught the people by example too.
Pray God, in other things they may do so.
Few staid, of any calling or degree,
Who to their Country-^riends might welcome be;
Or, of themselves were able to provide
A place of Harbor, where they might abide.
Yea some, (to escape uncertain Death) did fly
Into the Jaws of certain Beggary,
By leaving of their Callings; and are flowne
So far, and high a flight out of this Town,
On borrow'd-feathers; that their Neighbour^ fear,
They never more will in their shops appear.
Those of our wanton Gentry, that could brook
No Air, but Londons; London quite forsook;
And all that Crew of Spend-thrifts, whom (until
This Pl^gue did fright them) nor Star Chamber Bill,
Nor strictest Proclamation, could compel
Upon their own Inheritance to dwell;
Were now, among their racked Tenants feign
To seek for shelter; and to air again
Th^se mu^^^ Rooms, which their more thrifty Sire^
Kept warm and sweet with hospitable Fires.
God grant, that where they come, they may do good,
Among their Tenants, by their neighborhood.
Of some we hopeful are, they will be such;
And of some others we do fear as much,
That by their presence they will plague them more,
Then by their willing absence heretofore.
In many a mile you scarce could find a Shed,
Or Hovell, but it was inhabited,
(Sometime with double Families) and Stalls
And Barnes were trimmed up in stead of Halls.
Those Burgesses, that walked in Gowns, and Furs,
Had got them coats, and swords, and boots, and spurs;
And, till you saw them ride, you would have sworn,
That, they, for horsemen, might have served the turn.
Those Dames, who (out of daintiness, and Pride)
The rusticke plainness did (erewhile) deride,
(And, at a better lodging, Fob, would cry)
Beneath a homely roof were glad to lie;
And fawn on every Child, and every Groom,
That, so they might the welcomer become.
Those, who in all their lifetime never went
So far, as is the nearest part of Kent:
Those, who did never travel, till of late,
Half way to Pancridge from the City gate:
Those, who might think, the Sun did rise at Bow,
And set at Acton, for ought they did know:
And dream, young Partridge suck not, but are sed
As Lambs, and Rabbets, which of eggs are bred:
Even some of these have journeyes ventured on
Five miles by Land (as far as Edmunton.)
Some hazarded themselves from Lyon-K^y
Almost as far as Erith down by Sea:
Some rowed against the stream, and stragled out
A^ far as H^un^low-heath, or thereabout:
Some climbed High-gate-hill, and there they ^ee
The world so large, that they amazed be;
Yea some are gone so far, that they do kno^
Ere this, how Wheat is made, and Malt does grow.
Oh, how they trudged, and busled up and down,
To get themselves a furlong out of town.
And how they were becumbred, to provide,
That had about a m^le or two to ride.
But when whole households further off were sent,
You would have thought the Master of it, meant
To furnish forth some Navy, and that he
Had got his neighbors venturers to be.
For all the near acquaintance thereabout,
By lending somewhat help to set them out.
What hiring was there of our hackney Iades?
Wh^t scouring up of old, and rusty blades?
What running to and fro was there to borrow
A Safeguard, or a Cl^^ke, until the morrow?
What shift made Jack for girths? what shift made Gillian
To get her neighbors footstool, and her pillian,
Which are not yet ^etu^n'd? How great a pother
To furnish, and unfurnish one another
In this great voyage did there then appear?
And what a time was that for Bankrupts here?
Those who had thought (by night) to steal away,
Did unsuspected shut up shop by day;
And (if good luck it in conclusion prove)
Two dangers were escaped at one Remove:
Some hired Palfr^yes for a day, or twain,
But rode so far, they came not back again.
Some dealed by their neighbors, as the Jews
At their departure did the Egyptians use:
And some, (with what was of their own, content)
Took up their luggage, and away they went.
And had you heard how loud the Coaches ru^bled;
^eheld how Carres, and Cart^ together jumbled;
S^ene how the ways with people ^hronged were;
The Bands of Foot, the Troops of Ho^semen there;
What multitudes away by Land were sent;
How many thousands fo^th by Water went;
And how the weal^h of London thence was borne;
You would have wondered; and (almost) have sworn
The City had been leaving her foundation,
And seeking out another situation;
Or, that some Enemy with dreadful power,
Was coming to besiege, and to devour.
Oh; foolish people, though I justly might
Authorize thus my Muse ^o mock your flight,
And still to flout your foll^es: yet, compassion
Shall end it in a kind expostulat^on.
Why with such childish terror did you try
To run from him, from whom you cannot fly?
Why left you so the place of your abode,
Not hasting rather to go meet your God
With true repentance, who for ever has
A mercy for us in his greatest wrath?
Why did you not your lawful callings keep?
But straggle from you^ folds like wandering Sheep*
That had no Shepherd? And, oh, why, I pray*
You Shepherds, have you caused them to stray?
Your Neighbors why forsook you in distress?
Why did you leave your brethren comfortless?
When God did call for Mourning, why so fast
Did you to seek for mirth, and pleasures, have?
And take away from other, when you fled,
What, in their need, should them have comforted?
If Death be dreadful, stay, and learn to die;
For, Death affects to follow those that fly.
Had you not ^one, you might for ever after
Have said, That Sorrow profits more then Laugh^er.
You should have known that Death has limits here,
And loosed was, where he did bound appear:
That many were prese^ved in the flame,
And many burnt, that came not nigh the same.
Yea, some of you, before from hence you went,
Had, of these Truths, got some experiment.
What ^olly then, or Frenzy you bewitches,
To leave your houses, and go dye in ditches?
Forgo the Comfort, which your Ci^ie yields,
To venture for a lodging in the fields?
Or (which is worse) to travel far, and find
Those prove ungentle, whom you hoped, kind?
A Plague so bitter, That might Plagues be chuse^
I would be Plague-sicke, rather then so used.
Did you suppose the Pestilence would spare
None here, nor come to seize on any there?
All perished not, that did behind you stay;
Nor did you all escape, who fled away.
For, God your passages had so beset,
That He with many thousands of you me^.
In Kent, and (all along) on Essex side
A Troop of c^uell Fevers did reside:
And ro^nd about, on every other Coast,
Of several Country- Agues lay an hoa^t.
And, most of them, who had this place forsook,
Were either slain by them, or Prisoners took.
Sometime the Pestilence her self ^ad bin
Before them in their Lodging, at their Inn;
And has arrested them upon the Bed,
Brought many sick away, and meny dead.
Sometime (again) she after them has gone,
And when (perchance) she was not thought upon:
Among their friends, and in their merriment,
Has seized them, to their greater discontent.
She diverse apprehended on the way,
Who to so many mischiefs were a prey;
That poorest beggars found more pity here,
And lesser grief, then richer men had there.
I do not mean concerning that neglect,
That barbarous, unmanly disrespect
Their bodies had among the clownish crew,
When from the tainted flesh the spirits flew.
For, if their carcasses they did contemn,
What harm, or what disease was that to them?
What pain, or torment was it, if that they
(Like carrion) in the fields, unburied lay?
What felt they, being ^ragged like a Log,
Or hurled into a Saw-pit like a Dog?
What disadvantage could that Doctor have,
Who (learnedly) was drawn into his grave
By na^ed men? since those things do disgrace
The living rather, and do wrong the place
That suffers, or allows that barb'rousnesse
To shame the Christian Faith, which they profess.
Alas; my heart as little can bemone
A mangled carcass, as a broken stone*
It is a living body, and the pains,
Which I conceive a broken heart sustaines,
That moves me: their grief, in lifetime was,
And, whilst they lived, their sorrows did surpass
These fained ones, as Death, and loathed Care,
By Life, and true Content, excelled are.
Some, who forsook fair houses, large, and high;
Could scarcely get a Shed to keep them dry;
And such, who many bed^, and lodgings had,
To lie on straw without the doors were glad.
Some over-tyr'd with wea^inesse, and he^t,
Could not, for money, purchase drink, or meat;
But cruelly of succor were denied,
Till, through their faintness, they grew sick and died.
Some, who in London had been waited on
With many servants, we^e enclosed alone
In solitary places; where they might
Find leisure, to repent them of their flight.
And, when they had supplies at any need,
The bringers did (like those that Lions feed)
Even throw it at them; or else some where set it,
Where (after their departures) they might fet it.
And many a one (no helper to attend him)
Was left to live, or dye, as God should friend him.
Some, who unwisely did their homes forsake,
That trial of the Country they might make;
Have brought their lives to miserable ends
Before they could arive among their friends.
Some, having reached the places they desired,
(With no mean difficulty, weak, and tired)
Have missed welcome, where they sought relief;
And, stricken by unkindnesse, died with Grief*
The sickly Wife, could no ^ssistance have
To bring her Husbands body to the grave.
But was compelled, with a grieved heart,
To act the Parsons, and the Sextons part.
And he, that wanted strength ^o bear away
His mate, who dead within his presence lay;
Was feign to let the stinking body lie,
Till he in death should bear him company.
Ah me; what tongue can tell the many woes,
The passions, and the many griefs of those?
What m^rtall pen is able to express
Their great temptations in that loneliness?
What heart can think, how many a grievous fear
To those distressed people may appear,
Who are with such afflictions over-tak^n?
Of every Cr^ature in the world forsaken?
Without a Comforter left all alone,
Where to themselves they must themselves bemone,
Without a remedy? And where none may
Or know, or pity, what they ^eele, or say.
Me thinks to muse on those who suffered thus,
Should bring to mind the mercy showed us,
And make our pens and voices to express
The love of God, with hearty Thankfulness.
For when no sor^owes of mine own I had,
The very thought of those has made me sad.
And were it not that God has given me
Some trya^ls of those Com^orting^, which He
For men in their extremities provides,
And from the knowledges of others hides:
Or felt I not, how prevalent Gods power
Appears in us, when there is none of our:
What liberty he giue's, when we do fall
Within the compass of an outward thrall:
And what contentments He bestows on them,
Whom others do neglect, or else contemn:
Yea, had I not believed him who says,
That God does knowledge take of all our ways;
That He observes each rubb within our path,
With every secret sorrow, which it has;
That he is neares^ then, when we bemone
His absence, an^ suppose him furthest gone;
And often in us dwells, when Those abroad
(With most ins^lting) say; Where is their God?
Had this been hidden from me: I had here
For every line I writ, dropped down a tear;
And in a flood of sorrows drenched mine eyes,
When first I mused on these miseries*
But I have known them, to my great content*
And felt so often, what comforts God has lent,
When of all outward helps we are dep^ived;
That (could the same of all men be believed)
It would be thought, true Pleasures were possessed
Of none, but men forsaken, and distressed.
How ever; though such mercy God bestows,
And brings men comfort in their greatest woes;
Let none of us presume, (as some have done)
Without our Circle, foolishly to run;
Nor leave our proper station, that we may
Go seek our fortunes in an uncouth way.
Conceive me right; I do not here deny,
Or call in doubt the lawfuln^sse, to fly:
Nor am I of their counsel, who despise
All such as fled: nor, judge I too precise
Those, w^o the Person, or the Place avoid,
Which is with any noysomnesse annoyed.
For, when the causes of remove, are just,
We then may fly the Plague; nay, then we must;
Since, those who will not, (in such cases) go,
Tempt God, and fail in what they ought ^o do.
If that a King, or Prince, should live within
A City much infected, it were sin.
For he (no doubt) has some Vicegerent there
Who, in his absence, may supply his care:
Or, if that Place were certain of decay
By his departure; yet he might not stay.
The Reason is; there many thousands are
O^ Towns, and Cities, that in him have share.
Who, would conceive, it were unjustly done,
That he should venture all their wealth in One.
And make great Kingdoms hazards to endure,
The welfare of one City to procure.
So, Counselors of State, and he, whose Charge
Extends throughout the Common wealth at large,
With every other Magistrate beside,
(Except his power to some one place be tied)
Must shun the Plague; because that such, as he,
Sworn servants to the whole Weale-publique be.
And since the safest Physic and defense
For Children, in the times of Pestilence,
Is to remove them: they unwisely do,
Who, having wealth, and f^iends to send them to,
Neglect the means, by being over nice;
Or grudging at the charge, through avarice.
Moreover they, whose calling seems to lie
Within two several places, equally,
(Till some plain causes hinder) may be fre^
To live where safety best appears to be:
Unless their secret conscience do gainsay;
And who can judge of that, but God, and They?
Yea, Men, on diverse good occasions mo,
May from the places of Infection go.
For there be times of stay, and times of going,
Which, every one (that is discreet) well knowing,
Does censure no partic'lar Man, at all:
But calling unto mind, that blessed Paul
Was once even in a basket forth convay'd
From his Pursuers; yet no iotafraid
(At other seasons) to continue there,
Where bloody pe^secutions hottest were.
And if my words have done my meaning right,
My Muse denies not, but allows flight:
Provided always, that Men do not fly
From Casual Plagues, to Plagues with Certainty:
From those with whom the bands of Charity,
Of Duty, Friendship, or Affinity,
Or of their Calling, does requi^e a stay.
Provided also, when they part away,
That as God blessed them has, they somewhat ^^nde,
To comfort those, who must abide behind;
And, that they trust not to their Flight, as tho,
That, of it self could save: but, rather know,
And use it as the gracious means of him,
Who saves; and, not as that which saved them.
Let the^ consider likewise, that the Sin
Was partly theirs, which did the Plague begin;
And, in their absence (with a Christian fear)
Make suit for those, who must the burden bear,
From which they escape: yea, let them all confess
Their sins with penitenc^ and humbleness;
Avoiding every pleasure, where they live,
Which out of mind, their Brethrens cares may drive;
Lest God pursue them whither they are fled;
There ^eize upon them to their greater dread;
Or from them take away all due correction,
Which Plague were greater then this great Infe^tion.
For, when his Judgments, God, in wrath, removes,
His Mercy, then, the greater Judgment proves.
There be, I know, some people gone away,
Who mi^ding our afflictions, night and day,
Have much bewailed our distressed case,
And sent up earnest prayers for this Place:
For, of their Piety good fruits are seen,
And, by their hands, the poor refresht have been.
These, from this Den of Slaughter, were (no doubt)
By Gods especial favor called out,
Who, for their sakes, I hope, those towns will spare,
To which, for sh^lter, they es^aped are,
As he did Zoar. And I wish they may
Obtain their lives, and safeties for a prey.
But, there be some; (and would to God, that some
Were but a little one) who parted from
Our City walls, as if they had not gone
With Vengeance at their heels; or waited on
By fears and dangers; but, so finifi'd,
As if their meaning was, to show their pride
In Country Churches, for a week or twain,
Ride out like Co^kneies, and come home again:
The sorrows of their brethren they forgot;
In holy duties they delighted not:
In drunken meetings they their leisure spent;
In idle visits; foolish merriment:
And, to their Country-friends they carried down
Those sins that are too common in this Town.
Which (if they practice there, as here we do)
Will bring their wages, also, thither too.
These giddy Runnawayes, are they that were
Beginne^s of that great unmanly fear,
Which did first author of disorder prove.
These, caused that improvident Remove,
Which did both wrong the welfare of the Citi^,
Distract the Country, make it void of pity;
And, give occasion of those Tales which Fame
Has now dispersed, to our common shame.
For, if their flight had timely been provided,
(With Conscience and Discretion truly guided)
Th^i^ profit here at home had been the greater,
And* f^iends abroad, had entertained them better.
And, yet I take small pleasure to excuse
T^ose Pesants, who so grossly did abuse
T^eir Manhood and Religion, in denying
The dues of Charity, to people dying.
For, though their folly might their fall deserve,
Yet we our Christian pity should preserve,
Our brother in extremities releeving;
Not adding sorrows to increase his grieving,
Nor taking notice of his evil deed^,
So much, as of that comfort which he needs:
Till, he r^freshed by a friendly ^and,
His errors, by our love, may understand.
And, sure, there was a means to succor stranger^
In their distress, and to escape the dangers
Of that Infection, (which so much was feared)
Had Vnderstand^ngs eye be^ne better cleared;
And, that Self-love, and Avarice, removed,
Which kept good path^ unseene, and unapproved.
But, since that easy knowledge has been hid,
By wilful blindness, well enough I did,
If, here, I (Satyrizing) should express
The Countries folly, and fo^getfulness^.
And yet, I will not write, to their disgraces,
What of some Persons, and particular Places
Has rumor'd been: lest I should spirt a blot
So black, as that it would not be forgot
In future Ages; but, make Times-to-come,
Suspect, they had denied their Christendom.
For, should our Muse (who, if she list thereto,
Cares not who frowns, or frets, at what we do)
Should she put on that strain of Bitterness,
With which their cruelty we could express:
Should we in our description of their Fear,
Cause all their Indiscretion to appear:
Should we illustrate here, the true Relation^,
Of what has past in many Corporations;
What uproares in some Towns have raised been,
When Londoners, approaching them, were seen:
How master Mayor was straightway flockt about;
How they to Counsel went to keep them out;
How they their watches doubled, as if some
Had brought them news that Spinola would come:
And what ridiculous actions past among them;
Some few, perhaps, would think that we did wrong the^;
And, they would subjects be of scorn, and laughter,
For ^ll their evil willers, ever after.
Or, should we tell what propable suspicion
Appeared, sometime, of wisdom and discretion,
In goodman Constable; when, in a standing,
To wind-ward from the Rode (and there commanding
Brown bills, and Halberts) he examined
Such Travelers, as from the City fled:
And (at the very looks of them affrighted)
Sent feeble women, weary and benighted,
(Without or meat or drink) to try the field^
What Charity, their better nature yields.
If this we told, it might go hard* when we
Should apprehended in their Watches, be.
Or, should we show, what polici^s did pleas^
The wisdom of some rustic Justices;
Describe that wondrous witty stratagem
Which for a while was practiced by them
To starve the Plague; how Christianly they sought
That no provisions hither might be brought;
Should we produce their Orders, which of late
Were put in u^e, and wisemen laughed at:
Or, publish to the world what we have heard
Of their demeanors, when they were afeard:
How they were fooled by some of them that fled:
What course was taken to interre their dead:
How* he who for that work could hired be,
Was f^r his labor, chained to a tree
A full month after: how, they forced some
From their sweet wholesome houses forth to come;
And (being sick and weak) to make their bed
Within a palt^y new erected Shed,
Composed of clods; which near some Common-side
Their charitable Worships did provide:
Or, should I on some other matters touch
Which I have heard; it would enlarge too much
This book: and some of those, perhaps, perplex,
Whom I desire to counsel, not to vex.
But, I from aggravations will forbear,
And, those their oversights, at this time, spare.
For, some (although most others did not so)
Their love and Christian piety did show,
In counselling, in cherishing, in giving,
And, in the wisest manner of releeving.
Beside; I love the Count^y, as I pity
The sorrows and afflictions of the City.
And (since they both are guilty) being loath
To side with either; I the faults of both
Have showed, so, that neither I abu^e.
Now, they that like it may; the rest may choose.
The third Canto.
The House of MOVRNING, which most ^eare,
(And fly so much) is praised here.
It shows that outward Joys and Care,
Nor m^erly good, nor evil, are;
But things indiff'rent; which the wise
Nor over-praise, nor under-prize.
The strife within our Authors breast
About his stay, is next expressed.
Then does it orderly recite
What Reason argued for his flight:
What Faith alleged, to reprove
The Motives urging his remove:
What Arms for him, she did prepare,
To bide the shock of Death, and Fear:
What proof she to his Conscience made,
That, he a lawful Calling had,
In midst of this great Plague to tarry,
By Warrant-extraordinary:
What, thereupon he did conclude:
What Joy, and Confidence ensued:
How much this Favor he does prise,
Above Earths glorioust Vanities:
How he his Time desires to spend:
And so, this CANTO has an end.
HOw childish is the World! and what a path
Her Throng of braine-sick Lovers trodden has!
Like brutish herds they troop along together,
Both led, and leading on, they know not whither.
Much hoping, where no ground of Hope appears,
Much fearing, where indeed, there are no fears.
In those things pleased, which true Mirth destroy:
For that thing grieved which procures Joy:
Most shunning, what might bring most gain unto the^;
And seeking most, for what would most undoo them.
How few are so cl^are-sighted, a^ to see
What pleasures mi^gled with afflictions be?
Or what conten^ments do concealed lie*
Behind the seeming dangers which they fly?
How few have, by experience, unde^stood
That God has sent their troubles for their good?
How few consider, to what fearful ends,
The fair smooth way, of easefull Pleasure tends?
And, therefore, oh! how few adventure dare
Where Mournings, rather then where Laughters are?
Though God himself prefer the house of Griese,
Before vain Mirth; and Pleasures of this life
Has termed Thorns, that choke the heavenly seed:
Yet few of us have taken so much heed
Of what the sacred Volume does record,
(And, flesh and blood) distrusteth so the word
Of his fi^me Truth) that blindly we pursue
Our own vain counsels, and his Tract ^schew.
It Is therefore doubtful, it would vain appear,
If I should labor to discover here,
How many secret pleasures I have seen
While in the Ce^s o^ Mourning I have been.
And, what contentments God bestowed has,
When I have walked the solitary path
Of Disrespect; (ass^ulted by those fears,
Which often affront us in this Vale of tea^es)
O^ what prevailing hopes I have possessed,
When I, beyond all hope, have seemed oppressed.
For, vulgar men, do such expressions hold
To be but idle Paradoxes, told
By those, who grown distempered, through some gri^f
Vent melancholy passions, past belief.
And as our Vpland Pesants, from the shores
Beholding how the Sea swells, fomes, and rores,
Iud^e foolishly, that ^v'ry Seaman raves,
Who talks of mirth and safety on the waves:
So, they will fondly pass their doom on me,
Who strangers to the Seas o^ Sorrow be.
But, though the world allow not what I say,
Yet, that the Love of God, proclaim I may;
That, I may justify him in his Word;
That for mine own avail I may reco^d
What I have seen: and that experience might
Increase my hopes, and hope put fear to flight,
In future sufferings: here I testify,
(And Heaven is witness, I affirm no lie)
My soul did never feel more ravishment,
Nor ever tasted of more true content,
Then when my heart, nigh broke with secret pain,
Has borne as much as e're it could sustain;
And strugled with my passions, till it had
Attained to be excellently sad.
Yea, when I tears have powered out, where none
Was witness of my grief but God alone,
He has infused pleasures into me,
Which seldom can in public tast^d be.
Such Grief is Comforts Mother. And I mow
Often times with mirth, what I in tears did sow.
Before my eyes were d^yed; I have had
More cause of singing then of being sad.
The Lamp in darkest places gives most light;
And truest Joys arise from Sorrows night.
My Cares ar^ Blessed Thistl^s, unto me,
Which wholesome are, although the^ bitter be:
And though their leaves with prick^ be overgrowne*
(Which pain me) yet their flowers are full of down,
Wher^on my head lies easy when I sleep:
And I am never saddest when I weep.
Yet, long it was before I could attain
This Mystery: Nor does it appertain
To all. For, even as Sarah had not leave
Within her body Isack to conceive,
(Which laughter signifies) until in her
Those customs ^ailed which in women are:
So, in our souls, true Joys are not conceived,
Till we by some afflictions ar^ bereaved
Of carnal appetites, and cease from such
Vain pleasures as affect us overmuch.
To little purpose do they look for these
Conc^ptions, who are evermore at ease.
Such comforts are of those but rarely found,
Whose wheel of Fortune never runs round*
No soul can apprehend what makes glad
The grieved heart, but his that grief has had,
And various interchanges: nor can he
Who knows the joys that in such sorrows be
As these I mean, a true contentment take
In any merriment, this world can make:
(No not in all her pleasures) if among
Her sweets, there should be sharpness wanting long.
For (being fearful that his bodies rest
The souls true peace might secretly molest)
His mirth would make him dull: his being jolly
(As worldlings are) would make him melancholy:
And (if no other cause be thought upon)
Would g^ieve, because the sense of grief were gone.
Whilst I have gallopt on in that Career,
Which youth, in freedom, so affects here;
And had the most delightful blandishment,
My youth could yeed me for my hearts content:
When I in handsome robes have been araid,
(My Tailor, and my Mercer being paid)
When daily I on change of dainties fed;
Lodged, night by night, upon an easy bed,
In lordly Chambers; and had therewithal
Attendants forwarder then I to call,
Who brought me all things need^ull: when at hand*
Hounds, Hawks, and Horses were at my command:
When choose I did my walks, ^n hills, in valleys,
In Grove^, near Springs, or in sweet garden allies*
Repo^ing either in a natural shade,
Or in neat A^bors, which by Art were made:
When I might have ^equir'd without denial,
The Lut^, the Organ, or deepe-sounding Viol^,
To cheer my spirits; with what else beside
Was pleasant: when my friends did this provide
Without my cost or labor: Nay, when all
Those pleasures I have shared, which be^all
In praises, or kind welcommings, among
My dearest friends; my soul retained nor long
Nor perfect rest, in those imperfect things:
But, often droupt amid their promisings,
Grew dull, and si^kly: and, contrariwise
Has pleased been in want, ^and miseries.
For, when long time, even all alone they laid me,
Where every outward comfort was denayd me*
To many cares and wants unknown obtruded;
From fellowship of all mankind excluded;
Exposed to slandrous censures, and disgrace;
Subjected to contempts, and usage base;
With Tortures threatened, and what those attends;
By Greatmen frowned on; blamed of my Friends;
In^ulted on by Foes; and almost brought
To that for which their malice chi^fly sought:
Even then, my spirits mounted to their height,
And my Contentment slew her highest flight.
In those di^easings, I more joy received,
Then can from all things mortal be conceived.
In that contemned estate, so much was cleared
My Reasons eye; and God so bright appeared
To my dim-sighed Faith; that, lo, he turned
My Griefs to Triumphs Yea, me thought, I scorned
To labor for assistance from abroad,
Or beg for any favor, but from God.
I feared not that which others thought I feared;
Nor felt I pain, in that which sharp appeared:
But, had such inward quiet in my breast,
Till outward ease made way to my unrest;
That, all my Troubles seemed but a Toy.
Yea, my Affliction so encreast my Joy,
That more I doubted loss of my content,
By losing of my close imprisonment,
Then ever I can fear the bodies thrall,
Or any mischief which attend it shall.
For, as if some Antipathy ^rose
Betwixt the pleasures of the world, and those
Enjoyed then; I found true Joys begin
To issue ou^, as they were entering i^.
Ti^l others brought me hopes of my Release,
I scarcely held it worth my hopefulnesse.
I had no frighting dream; no waking care:
I took no thought for meat, nor what to wear;
I slighted frowns, and I despised the threat
Of such as threatened, were they mean or great*
I laughed at dreadful Rumors, and disdained
Of any sufferings to have then complained,
I valued not a jot the vulgar doom,
Nor what men prat^d might of me b^come.
I mind^d no such trifles, wherewith you,
And I, and others, are often busied now:
But, being, as it were exiled, then,
From living in the world, with other men,
Twixt God, and mine own Conscien^e, to and fro,
My thoughts, in a quotidian walk, did go.
With Contemplations, I was then inspired,
Beseeming one that wholly was retired.
I thought, like him, that was to live al^^e;
I did like him, that had to do with none.
And, of all outward actions left the care
Unto the world, and those who lived there,
Nor has God only pleased been to show
What comforts from a p^ivate grief may flow,
But, that a new experience might be taught me,
He to the house of Publike-s^rrow brought me
In this late Pestilence* And, there I saw
Such inward joy commixt with outward awe;
Things bitter with such sweetnesses allaid;
Such pleasures, into sorrows cup convaid;
Such fi^me- assurance, in the greatest dangers;
Such f^endlines, when others friends were strangers;
Such f^eedome in restraint; such ^ase in pain;
Such life in death, and every fear so vain,
(Which outwardly affrights) that Pleasures Court
Would half be robbed of her large resort,
(And stand less visited,) if men could see
What profits in the Cells of Sorrow be.
For, he that knew what wisdom there is had,
Would say that mirth were foolish, laughter mad:
That ^ase perpetu^ll brings endless pain:
That carnal joy arives at hope in vain:
That, from all outw^rd perils ^o be free,
May prove most per^llous* that, h^alth may be
The d^adl'est sickness: that, our pleasures are
But pit-f^ll^* our se^urity a snare;
And, that sometimes those things to which we run,
May bane us more, then those we s^eke ^o shun.
I found it so. And, in my blamed slay,
(Whilst others from the Plague made haste away)
I gained some renewings of that ^es^*
Whereof I h^d been formerly possessed.
It forced foll^, further to depart:
It brought Gods me^cies nearer to my heart:
Brave combats in my soul did then begin,
Which I took courage from, and pleasure in.
New trialls of my Frailty did befall;
And, of Gods love, I had new p^oo^es withal.
In all my discontentments, such con^ents,
And of Gods wo^kings, such experiments
Vouchsafed were; that crowned should I live,
With all those glorious wreathes that King^ can g^ve,
And had by them obtained each happin^sse,
Which wo^ldlings in their greatness do^ possess;
I would not sell the comfort of my s^ay
For that, and all which those imagine may.
Nor do I over-prise the same, although,
The ignoran^e of some will think I do:
For, it has left within me, ever since,
Of Gods firm love, so strong a confidence,
That, whatsoever accidents betide,
I hope to stand the better fortified
Whilst here I live: and that no time to come
Can send me to a place, so perilsome,
That I shall fear it, or, to undergo
The dreadfull'st perils man can fall into;
If that my calling do oblige me to it,
Or God, in Justice, m^ke me undergo it.
In other cases, I expect no mo^e,
But, rather, less imboldning then before.
For, he that any dangerous task assumes,
Without good warrant, fo^lishly presum^s;
Tempts God; and justly perishes, unless
The ve^le of Mercy hide his wilfulness.
Yea, they who over desp'rately have dared
Bold things at first; at last have basely feared,
Re^enting their foole-hardinesse* in vain,
When hope was lost, of turning ba^k again.
For, though from dang^r^, griefs, and miseries,
Far greater comforts oftentimes arise,
Then from prospe^ity (if we attend
God^ pleasure, and accept what he does send)
Yet, o^ themselves, nor pains, nor pleasures can
Felicitate; nor is the wit of man
So perfect, that precisely he does know
His own just temper, or his nature so,
As to appoint himself, what will be needing
Of weal, or woe, (naught wanting, or exceeding)
And therefore, as some man has by affecting
Ease, wealth, or temp'rall fame, (without respecting
Gods pleasure) often perished by that
Which his unbounded will ha^h reached at;
So, they who shall that ^ase or wealth contemn
(Which God by law^ull means does offer them)
And they, who shall unthankfully refuse,
Of any outward ble^sing, means to use,
(Through discontent, self trust, or wilful pride)
When they might honestly those means provide*
Even both of these are g^ilty of offense,
Against the wise ete^nall Providence:
And are in danger to be l^ft of God,
In those misleading p^ths which they have trod.
These things I mused; and in heart revolved
A thousand more, before I was resolved
To keep in London, where m^n draw no breath
But that which menaced the b^dies death.
And, seeing* many have condemned the fact.
As an unwar^antabl^, foolish act:
Since, i^ may teach them to forbear to give
Their Verdict, till they Evidence receive:
Since, thus to mention it, a m^ane^ may be,
To build again the like Resolves in me
When ^uture peril so requires it;
And when, perhaps, this mind, I may forget:
Yea, since the manner of it, may, perchance,
Deliver others from some ignorance,
And help their Christian Res^lutions out,
When they are thrall'd with carnal fear, or doubt:
Even for these causes, (and to glorify
The power of God in this my victory)
I will relate what Reason^ m^de me stay:
What ^opes they were, which drove my fears away:
And, with what circumstances, I obtained
That knowledge, which my shaking Faith maintained.
When I perceived the PESTILENCE to rage
In every street, nor sparing sex, nor age;
How from their City-hive, like Bees in May,
The fearful Citizens did swarm away:
How fast our Gentry hasted to be gone:
How often I was urged and called upon,
To bear them company: what safeties were
By absence promised; what great terrors here
My death did m^nace: how, by timely flight
I might behold my Country with delight:
How nothing could be gotten by ^y stay,
But wants, and new afflictions every day:
With such like disadvantages, which brought,
A hundred other musings to my t^oug^t.
They made it seem, a while, well wor^h reproving,
To stay, a minute, longer from removing*
But, then my Conscience also did begin
To draw such powerful Moti^es, from within*
And, to propose before my understanding
Such Reasons, my departure countermanding,
As made me stagger, and new doubts to make,
What course it best behoved me to take.
At first, I thought by counsel from the Wise,
To build up my Resolves, and to advise
By their opinions what I should pursue;
But, of the gravest I perceived so few
Who could advise themselves; that I grew more
Divided by their counsels, then before.
I saw such foolishness, and such distractions,
Appear among them in their words and actions;
That I perceived they had enough to do,
Their own particulars to look unto.
Then, guided by example would I be;
But, that I quickly found no Rule ^or me;
For, they who in opinion do consent,
Often differ, in ^he active President.
And some, who have a tongue the truth to say,
Have wanted grace to walk the safest way.
Beside, men's actions, which indiffe^ent are,
May foolish, wise, or bad, or good appear,
As their unknown occasions are who do them;
And, small respect is to be had unto them,
By way of P^esident, till we can find
Their outward motives, and their secret mind*
This heeding; and still waxing more molested,
With diff^ring thoughts, and reasons undisgested,
I knew no better way, then to repair
For counsel unto God, ^y humble Prayer;
Beseeching his direction, how to take
That course, which for his glory* most should make.
And he (I think) was please^ to suggest,
That if I asked my Conscience what was bes^,
His Word and Spirit would inform her so,
That she should show me what was best to do.
Then, from the noise of other men's persuasions,
(From selfe-c^nceit, and from those vain occasions,
Which bring disturbances) I did retire,
Gods pleasure, of my Conscience, to enq^ire.
Who, finding in my breast a strong contention
Twixt Faith and Reason; and, how their dissension
Was first to be composed (that I might
The sooner understand the truth aright)
She called a Court within me; s^mmon'd thither
Those Powers, and all those Faculties together,
Which Tena^ts a^e in chief unto the Soul:
Their faulty inclinations did control:
And, that she might not without profit chide,
Some ill advis^d courses rectified.
Then willed she FAITH and REASON to debate
Their Cause at large: and, that which they, of late,
Had urged confusedly within my breast,
She willed them, into Method, to digest:
That so, my Judgment might the better see,
To whether part I should inclined be
They both o^e^'d. And, REASON (who supposed
Delay bred danger) hastily composed
Those many strong persuasions, wherewithal
She did my person from the City call;
Before my Conscience, them in order laid,
And (as half angry) thus me thought she said.
What meanest thou, thus fondly, out of season,
To show thy boldness in contempt of Reason?
Why art thou always these mad courses taking?
Thy Lines, and Actions, Paradoxes making?
Why thus pursu'st thou what to ruin tends,
To glad thy foes, and discontent thy friends?
By making wild adventures, to the blame
Of thy blind Faith, and my perpetual sh^me?
Is It not enough, that by thy little caring
To humor Fools, and by thy over daring
To ^eard proud Vices, thou have lately cros^
Thy way to riches, and preferment lost?
Is It not enough, that when thou do become
The scorn of Foole^, thou were delivered from
A m^^ked Hate, even in that day, and place,
Which Malice had assigned for thy disgr^ce?
And sawst the shame of that unjust I^tention
Alight on him who plotted that Invention?
Is It not enough, that thou escape^ have
Through many wants and perils und^sgrac'd,
When thy adventurous Muse drew down upon thee
Those Troubles which were like to have undone thee?
Suffice not these, unless thou now assay
A needless act? and fool thy life away
By tempting Heaven, in wilful staying there,
Where, in thy face grim death does always stare?
Look what thou d^st, and w^ll obse^ve ^hine errors,
For, thou art round about, enclosed with terrors.
And if thou be not stupid thou may see
That there is cause thou should affrighted be.
Do thou not smell the vapors of the Gr^ve?
Do thou not hear thy plague-sicke neighbors rave?
Do thou not taste infection in the Air?
Do thou not view sad objects of despair?
Do thou not f^ele thy vital powers assailed?
Do thou not find thy spirits often quail^d?
Or with thy judgment have thou lost thy sense,
That thou do make no greater speed from hence?
Mark there, how fast with Corpses they do throng*
See yonder, how the Shadows, pass along.
Behold, just now, a man before thee dies:
Behind thy back, another breathless lies.
That Bell, now ringing, sounds out the Knell
Of him, whom thou did leave, last evening, well.
Lo, he that for his life, lies gasping, there,
Is one of those who thy companions were
This very morning. And, see, see, the Man
That Is talking to thee, looks pale, and wan,
Is sick to death; and, if thou do not run
For help, will die before his tale be done.
Yet, art thou no^ afraid? I prithee, tell
Why might thou not have been that man as well?
Though he this minute has prevented thee,
Why may not thou, the next that follows be?
Why should not thou as quick^y drop away,
Since, flesh and blood thou art, as fra^l as they?
What can thy speedy dissolution hinder,
Since thy complexion is as apt as tinder
To take that Flame? And, if it seize thee must,
What art thou better, then a heap of dust?
There is no Constitution, Sex, Degree,
Or Age of man, from this contagion free.
Nor can thou get an Antidote to fit
For all Infection, though, perhaps, thy wit
Could learn thy temper so, as not to wrong^
Thy health, by things too weak, or over strong.
For, men often change the temper they should hold,
Are sometime hot; sometime again are cold*
One while are sprightly, otherwhile are dull;
Are now too empty, and anon too full:
That, it is a doubtful, and a curious act,
To add a just proportion, and substract
(In using outward means of pres^rvation)
According to the bo^ies variation.
And, many, therein failing, lose their lives,
By wrong, or misapplied Preservatives.
Thou shall have, therefore, but uncertain hopes
From Druggists, or Apothecary shops.
To warrantize thy health* if thou on those
In staying here, thy confidence repose.
And sure, thou neither harbor'st such a thought,
That, thou of any better s^uffe art wrought
Then other men: nor trustest unto Charms,
To keep off this Disease from doing harms:
For, those unhallowed Medicines, and i^pure,
Breed greater Plagues, then those they seem to cure.
Nor art thou, of that Brotherhood, which sees
The Book of Gods particular Decrees;
And Gypsy like (by heathnish Palmistry,
Or by the lines of Phisiognomy)
Conjectures dares not alone to give,
Who of this Plague shall dye, or who shall live:
But also wicke^ly, presumes to t^ll
Which man shall go to heaven, and which to hell:
Of these I know thou art not. For, as yet
I hope thou have not so forgone thy wit:
To credit their illuding p^ophanations,
Which are but fantosmes of illuminations
Begot in these late Ages (by misch^nce)
Betwixt much pride, and zealous ignorance.
Thou do not think thy merits greater are
Then other men's, that God thy l^f^ should spare.
Nor can thou hope thy safety to poss^sse,
For that thy follies or thy sins are less.
Since if thou had but one time been misled,
Thy life for that one time were so^fei^ed.
And, this Disease, with outward ma^ks, does strike.
The Righteous, and the Wicked, both alike.
Then, since thou art a Sinner, and art sure,
That sin did first this Pestilence procure:
Since thou may also justly say with grief,
That, thou of all transgressors art the chief:
Since thy offenses some of those have bin,
Which h^lpe to bring this great Infection in:
Nay; since it may be (if thou search thy heart)
That thou a principal among them art,
Who from the Ship must Ionas-like be thrown,
Before this Tempest will be over blown*
Why does it not thy guil^y soul dismay,
And make thee hasten more to fly away?
It may be thou do vainly hope for Fame,
By doing this. Oh! what availes the same,
When thou art raked up quite void of sense,
Among the slaughters of the Pestilence?
What will it profit when thou sleep'st in clay,
Some* few should praise, and some lament thy stay?
Some heed it not? Some make a mock thereat?
Some deem thee foolish, others d^sperate?
Some, judge thy tarying might for trifles be?
Some, for thy best intention slander thee?
Or with base trash thy breathless Muse bely^*
Or, mis-report thy dying, if thou dye?
For, if thou chance to perish in this Place,
These ways, and other means to thy disgrace,
Thy Foes will find* and in thy fall contented,
Accomplish what, thy life might have prevented.
But say to escape alive thy Lot it be;
A troop of other perils wait on thee.
Thou know not what extremities may fall,
Nor how thy heart may struggle therewithal.
Such Poverty upon this Town may seize,
E're God assuage the rage of this Disease,
That means may sail thee; and before supply
Thy friends can send thee, thou may famisht lie:
For they who now affect thee, and with whom
Thou shall, perhaps, to live resolved become,
Even they may perish in this Pest, and leave thee
To strangers whose affections will deceive thee:
In time of health, but slenderly befriend thee:
In sickness, to a lonely Room commend thee:
Make spoil of what is thine, and senseless be
Of helping, and of all regard of thee.
And then it will, perchance, afflict thy mind
That thou unto thy self were so unkind,
As to neglect that wholesome Country Air*
Whereto thy friends invited thy repair.
Thou may remember, when it is too late,
Those pleasures, and that happy healthy state
Thou might have had: And wi^h how much respect
Thou should have lived with those that thee affect;
A comfort to thy Parents, who with fear,
D^e sorrow for thy needl^sse lingering here:
For, them thou leavest, an^ some friends beside,
(To live, 'twixt hope and fear, unsatisfi'd
By this thy doing) whom thou do abuse,
If that which may d^scomfort them thou choose.
And, when they shall thy wilfulness condemn,
With what good Reasons will thou answer them?
Thy Dwelling is not here; nor is thy stay
Compelled by Affairs that urge it may.
Thou have nor public neither private charge;
But, may in any place, go walk at large.
The wo^ld conceives not the least suspicion,
That thou art either Surgeon, or Physician,
(Whose Art may stand this place in any s^eed;)
Or that thy friends will thy attendance need.
For thou can neither Broths nor Caudles make,
Nor drenches good enough for horse to take.
Thou have no Calling, that may warrantize
This boldness: neither can thy wit devise
How thou will answer God, f^r daring thu^
An act so needless, and so perilous.
Consider well, that there are pains in death;
Consider, that when thou ha^t lost thy breath,
Thy Flesh, the dear companion of thy Soul,
Shall be rejected as unclean, and foul,
And, lodge within a Grave, contemned and vile,
Which might have lived esteemed, yet a while.
Consider, that thou have not an estate
Of being, which is base or desperate;
But such, as few on earth possess a better,
Though each one, that has ought, enjoyes a greater.
Consider, that thou do endanger now
The blessing of long life. Consider, how
Thou might have lived to a larger measure
Of riches, of preferment, or of pleasure;
And profited thy Country, whereunto
Thy Death, or Sickness, will no service do.
Nay, if thou now miscarry, where will be
Those honest hopes which late possessed thee?
To those thy Studies who an end shall add,
Which but a while ago, beginning had?
And, being left unfinisht, make the pain
And hours, upon them spent, to be in vain?
With somewhat thou endued art, whereby
Thou ma^st thy blessed Maker glorify;
Thy self advantage, and a joy become
To such as well affect thee; and against whom
(If thus thy self thou separate) thou shall
Commit a most inexpiable fault.
Oh! therefore, I beseech thee, wary be,
To think what service God requires of thee:
Think, what thou w^st thy self; and call to mind,
That some wel-wille^s thou may leave behind,
Whose hopes thou should not wilfully bereave,
(Whose loves thou should not unrequited leave)
By hazarding thy Life, which is a debt
To their deservings. For, thou know not, yet,
How that may grieve thy soul, or fill thy head
With troubled sancies, o^ thy dying-bed.
I cannot make d^scovery, by all
My faculties, and po^'rs rational,
What work tho^ may imagine should be done
T^at's worthy of the hazard thou do run.
Nor can, as yet, my understanding reach
(What hope soever Faith may please to pre^ch)
To those Felicities; which after death
Her supernatural Doctrines promises.
Nor find I suc^ assurances, a^ may
Preserve thee unaffrighted in thy stay.
For when within my Natural Scale I place
Those Arguments, and Promises of Grace,
Which Faith alleges; they so ayrie prove,
That they my Balance very little move.
Yea, such transcendent things declares she*
As they me thinks should so distemper thee,
That doubts and terrors rather should possess
Thy Soul, then hopes of real ^appinesse;
Since what in Death, or after Death shall come,
Are things, that Nature is estranged from.
Fly therefore, this great peril. Seek a place
Where thou may plead more safely of thy Case:
And, since thy God, with Reason, thee does bless,
Now, most thou need'st it, be not reasonlesse.
All this (and what the ca^nall wit of man
Object, in such an undertaking can)
Did R^ASON urge, to make my stay appear
An act imp^ovident, and full of fear:
And what her seeming rightful c^use advances,
Was utt'red with such dreadful ci^cumstances,
That she did hal^e pe^swade me to confess,
My Resolution would be foolishness.
But, when my R^ASON had no more to speak,
My FAITH began: and though her st^ength was weak,
(Because my ^railties had enfeebled her)
Yet, then I felt her with more vigor stir,
Then in less perils. For, she blew aside
Those fogs whe^ewith my heart was t^rrifi'd:
Made clear my Judgment: and (as having wa^gh'd
The speech f^regoing) thus, me thought, she said.
How wise is REASON in an Ethnicke School,
And, in divine proceedings, what a fool?
How many likely things she mus^er can,
To startle and amaze a natural man,
Which, when I am advised withal, are found
But pannick fears, and terrors without ground!
And yet, how often does blind Ignoranc^,
Above my reach her shallowness advance?
Or else of madness, wickedly condemn
My wisdom, and my safest paths contemn?
Yet be not thou (my Soul) deceived by
The foolishness of humane Sophistry.
But, since by thy Afflictions, thou have got
Exp^rience, which the world attaineth not;
Give heed to me, and I will make thee know
Those things which carnal Reason cannot show.
Yea make thee by my power more certain be
Of that which mortals can nor hear nor see,
Then of the plainest objects that appear
Unto the sense of corp'rall eye or ear:
And though my promise, or my counsel seem
To vulgar Judgments, but of mean esteem,
I Will so enable the^ those seares to bide,
W^erewi^h the worldly-wise are terrified;
And, teach thee such contentedness to gain,
Though in Deaths gloomy shades thou do remain:
That, thou (without all doubtings) shall perceive,
Thou should not this afflicted City leave.
And Flesh and Blood, with wonder, shall confess^
That Faith has power to teach men fearlesnesse,
I^ perils; which do make their hearts to ache,
Who scoff at her, and part with Reason take.
It cannot be denied that this Place
Yields dread enough, to make the boldest face
To put a palenesse on, unless the mind
Be over much to sen^^esnesse enclinde:
Because, we nat'rally abhor to see
Such loathed objects of mortality.
'T^s also true, that there is no defense
To guard the body from this Pes^ilence,
Within the compass of man's power or wit:
Nor can thy merit so prevail with it,
But that (for ought thou know) thou may f^ll
The growing number of Death^ weekly- Bill.
And what of that? whilst I befriend thee shall,
Ca^ such a common danger thee apal^?
Shall that, which heathenish men, and women bear,
(Yea tender infants) without shows of fear,
Amate thy spirit? shall the drawing nigh
Of that, from which thou has^ no means to ^^ye,
(And which thou walk toward, every day,
(With seeming stou^nesse) fright thee now away?
Is Death so busy grow^e in London streets,
That h^ with no man in the Country me^ts?
Beleeve^^ thou, the number he has slain
Has added any thing unto the pain?
Or, have thou lately apprehended more
Deaths fearful gast lin^sse, then heretofore,
That in this time of trial thou should find
Thy Soul to slavish Cowardice enclinde?
Death is that Path, which every man must tread;
And, when thou shall d^scend among the dead,
Thou go but thither where thy fathers be,
And whither, all that live shall follow thee.
Death is that Haven, where t^y Bark shall cas^
Her hopeful Anchor, and lie moored fast,
Exempted from those furious winds and seas*
Which in thy heavenly voyage, thee diseas^.
Death i^ the Iaile-deliv'ry of ^he Soul:
Thy joyful year of Iubilee: thy Goal:
The Day that ends thy sorrows, and thy sins;
And that, wherein, best happiness begins.
A lawful act, then wherefore should thou fear
To prosecute; although thy death it were?
Full often, have I enabled thee to bide
The brunt of dreadf^ll storms, unterrifide*
And, when thy dastard Reason (not espying
That heavenly Game, at which thy Faith was flying)
Di^heartned grew; I did thy body free
From every p^rill which enclosed thee:
So working, that those thin^s thy praise became,
Which Malice had projected for thy shame;
And, common Reason, who supposed thee mad,
Did blush to see how little wi^ she had.
Yet, now again, how f^olishly she tryes
To cast new fogs before thy Judgments eyes?
that childish Bug-Bea^es has she mus^red ^ere,
To scar t^y senses with a causeless f^are?
Of those loathed Objects wherefore does she tell,
Which v^x the sight, the hearing, and the smell?
Since, when the utmost of it shall be said,
All is but Death; which can but strike thee dead.
And when that is done, thou shall (by me revived)
Enjoy a better life then thou has^ lived.
If those hobgoblin terrors of the grave,
(Wherewith mere natural men affrighted have
Their troubled souls) deter thee from that path,
Whereto the will of God injoined has;
To thee (oh! Soul) how dreadful would it be
If WAR, with all her fears enclosed thee?
Nay, if such common terrors thee amaze,
How would thou quake, if in a general blaze,
The world should flame about thee? (as it may,
Perhaps, before thou see another day)
Sure, if these Scar-crowes do det^rre thee so,
Thou scarce wilt welcome (as thou oughtst to do)
That Moment when it comes; nor so rejoice,
As they, who long to hear the Bridegroomes voice.
Here therefore stay, and practice to inure
Thy soul to trials; that thou may endure
All chang^s, which in after times may come:
And wait with gladness, for the Day of Doom.
Seek here, by holy dread, to purge away
Those Crimes which heap up terrors for that day.
Endure the scorching of this gentle fire*
To purify thy heart from vain desire.
Learn here, the death of righteous men to dye;
That thou may live with such eternally.
H^re, exercise thy Faith, and watch, and pray,
That when thy body shall be mixed with clay
The frigh^full Trumpet, whose amazing sound
Shall startle H^ll, and shake earths massy Round.
May make thee leap with gladness from thy grave,
And no sad horrors in thy Conscience have.
What can thou hope to purchase here below,
That thou should life unwillingly for go?
Since, there is nothing which thou can possess,
Whose sweetness is not marred with bitterness:
Nor any thing so safe, but that it may,
To th^e, become a mischief, many a way?
If honorable thou might live to grow,
That honor may effect thy overthrow.
And (as it makes of others) make of thee
A thing as blockish, as bruit creatures be*
If Rich; those Riches may thy life betray;
Choke up thy virtues, and then fly aw^y.
If Pleasure follow thee; that pleasing vain
May bring thy soul to everlasting pain:
Yea, that which most thou longest to e^joy,
May all the pleasures of thy life destroy.
Seek therefore true co^t^n^ment where it lies,
And fear not every B^bies fantasies.
If Life thou love; Death is that entering in
Where life which is eternal does begin.
There, what thou most desire is enjoyed;
And, Death it self, by dying is destroyed.
Though length of life, a blessing be confessed,
Yet, length of days in sorrow is not best.
Although the Saylor, sea-roome does require,
To reach the harbor is his chief desire:
And, though it is well our debts may be delayed,
Yet, we are best at ease when they are paid.
If ^itle^, thou aspire unto: Death brings
The Faithful, to become immortal Kings:
Whose glory passes earth^y pomp, as far
As Phoebus does outshine the Morning Star.
Desire thou a pleasant healthful dwelling?
By Death thou gain'st a Country so excelling;
That, plenty of all us^full things is there,
And all those objects that delightful are.
A golden pavement thou sh^lt walk upon;
And lodge in Buildings walled with precious stone.
If in rich Garmen^s to be clothed thou seek,
The Persian Mon^rks never had the like:
For, Purity it self thy Robe shall be;
And like the Stars, thy Crown shall s^ine on thee.
Have thou enjoyed those companions here,
Whose love and fellowship delightful are?
Thou shall, when thou from sight of those art gone,
Of that high Order be installed one,
Which never did false Brother entertain;
Whereof, even God himself is Sovereign:
And in whose company thou shall possess
All perfect, dear, and lasting friendlinesse.
Yea, there even those whom thou on earth have lo^ed
^n^^se time (with such love as is approved)
Thou shall enjoy again: and not alon^
Their friendship; but the love of every one
Of those blessed men and women, who both were,
And are, and shall be, till our Judge appear.
Has any mortal beauty pleased thee so,
That, from her presence thou ^rt loath to go?
Thou shall in stead of those poor imperfections,
VVh^r^on thou setlest here unsure affections*
The Fountain of all Beauties, come to see
(Within his lovely bosom lodged be)
And know (when thou on him have fixed thine eye^)
That, all earths Beauties are deformities.
To these, and happinesses, greater far
Then by the heart of man conceived are,
Death makes passage. And, how grim soever
He may to those that stand aloo^^ appear;
Yet, if thou bide unmoved in thy place,
Till he within his arms do thee embrace;
Thou sh^lt perceive that who so timely dies,
Enjoyes contentments which this life denies.
Thy fear of painfulnesse in death is vain^;
In Death is eas^; in Life, alone, is pain.
Man makes it ^readfull by his own inventions*
By causeless doubts, and groundless apprehensions.
But, when it comes, it brings of pain, no more
Then Sleep, to him that restless was before.
Thy Souls departur^, from the Flesh, does maze,
And thee afflicts more then there is cause:
For, of his sting, thy Saviou^, Death despoiled:
And, fears, and dangers from the Grave exiled.
Thou losest not try Body when it dies;
Nor does it perish, though it putrifies.
For, when the time appointed, it has lain,
It shall be raised from the dust again,
And, in the s^ead of this corrupted one,
Thy Soul, a glorious Body shall put on.
But had thou not a Faith which might procure the^
Such comforts, and such life in death assure thee:
Or, though thou should, by dying, be possessed
Of nothing else, but of a senseless rest:
Me thinks thy ^arnall Reason should, for that,
Persuade thee rather to be desperate,
And stay, and seek for Death, e'^e languish in
Perpetual sorrows, such as thine have bi^.
For, if to Godward, ^oy thou foelest not,
What comfort to the world-ward ^ast thou got,
Which may desirous make thee to delay,
Or linger out thy life another day?
It Is true that God has given thee a share
I^ all thos^ Pleasures, that good pleasures are;
And (to the Giver^ glory be i^ spoken)
H^e has bestowed on thee as many a ^ok^n
Of his abundant love, as he bestows
On any, with so sew external sh^wes.
For even of outward things he does impart
As much as fits the place in which thou art;
With full as many pleasures as may serve,
Thy Patience, in thy suff^ings, to preserve:
And, when for Rest, and Plenties, thou art fitter,
I know, he will not make thy cup so bitt^r.
But if thou live for outwar'd pleasures merely;
By living thou do buy them over dearly.
For (if thy peace in God were s^t aside)
So many ways thou have been crucified,
That some would think thy Fortune (if they had it)
Most bitter; though most sweet thy hopes have made it.
H^re, but a Pilgrimage thou do possess,
I^ wandering, and perpetual restlesnesse.
Like Travelers, in sunshine and in rain,
Both d^y and wet, and dry and wet again.
With rest, each Morning, well refresh^ and merry*
And, every Evening, full of grief, and weary.
To Vanity, in bondage thou do lie,
Still beaten with new storms of Misery;
And, in a path to which thou art a stranger,
Assaulted with variety of Danger.
His Face, sometime, is hid, whence comforts flow,
And, men and devils, seek thy overthrow.
Sin multiplies upon thee, every day:
Thy vital powers, will more and more decay:
Wealth, honor, friends, and what thou best do love,
Does leave, deceive thee, or thy torment prove;
Man's very Body burdens him; and brings
Unto itself a thousand torturings*
Thy Heart, with many Thinkings is perplexed:
Yea, by thine own Affections thou art vexed:
And (though by overcomming them at last,
Thy soul has comfort when the fight is past,)
Thou have perpetual conflicts, which requir^
Continual watchfulness: for, no Desire
Or natural Passion, ever did molest
The heart of Man, that strives not in thy breast.
In every Pleasure, somewhat lurks to scar thee*
In every Profit, somewhat to ensnare thee:
Whole armies of Afflictions swarm about thee,
Some fight within thee; some assail without thee:
And, that which thou conceivest shall releeve thee,
Becomes often another means to gri^ve thee.
Yea, thine own thoughts, thy spe^ches, and thine actions,
Occasion discontentments, and distraction:
And all the portion which thou do inherit,
Yields naught, but perturbations of the spirit.
In Childhood, all thy pleasures were but toys;
In heat of Youth, as fruitless were thy joys:
Thy riper years, do naught but ripen care:
And, imperfections, thy perfections are:
If Old thou grow, thy griefs will aged be*
And, Sickness, till thou dye, will live in thee.
Thy Life's a Warfare, which must quite be done,
E're dangers vanish, or the Field be won.
It is a Voyage full of weariness,
Till thou thy wished harbor do possess:
And, thou of no external Joy can b^ast,
That may not e're thy dying day be lost.
But, truth to say, what thing do thou possess,
Which others think to be a happiness?
The world allows thee little that is hers,
And ^hee to very small esteem prefers.
Among her Minions: but, in every place
Endeavors to affront thee with disgrace;
D^prives thee of thy labors, and bestows
On Parasites, on Foo^es, and on thy Foes,
Thy due: and with a spightfull enviousnesse,
Thy best approved Studies does suppress.
Behold, ^ ^rothy Masq^e, an idle Song,
The witless jesting of a scurrilous tongue,
The capring Dancer, and the foining Fencer,
The bold Buffoone, the slye Intelligencer;
Those fool^sh raving fellows, whose delights
Are wholly fixed on their Curs and Kites*
The Termly Pamphlet^rs, whose Dedications
Do sooth and claw the times abominations:
Even such ^ike things as these can purchase grace,
And quickly compass Pension, ^ift, or Place;
When, thy more honest Labors are abused,
Contemned, slighted, or at best refused.
If such a one as these forenam'd, resort
To set abroach his qualities in Court,
He finds respect, and as an useful man,
His Faculty, some place afford him, can.
He soon has entertainment. Or if not,
Yet, something may sor his avail be got.
A base Invention, that scarce merit may
The reputation of a Puppet-play,
So^e spangled Courtier, or some foolish Lord*
Admires, affects, and of his ow^e accord
Prefers it to the Prince, or to the King,
As an ingenious, or much useful thing.
And (ten to one) if then the Author can
But humor well his Lordship, or his man
(That rules his Honors wisdom) it may gain him
Some such like Lord as that to en^ertaine him,
For his c^mpanion; y^a, the privy purse
May open to him: and, be fares worse
Then many a Fool has done, unl^sse e're long*
He purchases to be enro^l'd among
The best Deservers; and arise to be
Superior to a better man then be.
Twixt these and thee what distances appear?
And, twixt your Fortunes what a space is there*
When thou had f^nished a Work divine,
(As much for others profit, as for thine)
Thou scarcely found'st a man, to make thee way
Thy Present, at thy Soveraigne^ fee^ to lay.
And when thou did* No sooner laid he by
What tendered was, but some in^urious eye
Did quickly take thereof a partial view,
And with detracting Censures thee pursue.
Yea, those mere Ignorants, whose courtly wi^
Can judge of nothing, but how clothes do fit;
How Congees should be acted; how their Boy
Obs^rve them should; or some such weighty ^oy:
Those Shreds of Complement, patcht up for things
To fill vast Rooms in Palaces of Kings,
(As Antiques do in Hangin^^) more for show*
Then any profit, which from them c^n flow.
^v'n those (scarce worth our laughing at) have pa^^
Their doomes on that which thou presented have;
As if they understood it: and, as those,
^y chance did censure, so the Censure goes.
If these, or any such like Mountebanks,
By slavish fawning, or by pickin^ thanks;
By ho^eliest services, (or worse) by cheating;
Extorting from the poor, or by defeating
Men hone^^ly disposed, (or, by any
Of those ill means, whereof this age has many)
Can, out of heggery, their fortunes rear*
To hundreds, or to thousands by the year:
They think themselves abused, if any grutch
O^ m^rmur, as if they had got too much.
But, though thou from thy childhood were employed
In painf^ll studies, and had not enjoyed
So much external profit, as would pay
The charges of thy Troubles, for a day:
(Nay, rather, hindrance had, and punishment,
For that, which gave most honest men content)
Yet (mark their dealing) when but hope there was
Of gain to thee (which never came to pass)
And though that gain were less then Traders can
Allow sometimes unto a Iourney-man:
Yea though it were to no man's prejudice;
(^ut many profiting) and did arise
By thine own labors: that small yearly summ^
Expected for, naught, yet, but loss does come)
Was grumbled at; as if it had been more
Then any ever gained heretofore;
And would the Commonweal have prejudised,
Had none, thereof, to frustrate thee, de^ised.
Some, therefore (whose maliciousness is yet
Vnanswer'd for) themselves against thee set;
And, by the damage of their own estate,
Have labored, thee and thine to ruinate.
Some others, as injuriously, as they,
Laid causeless Nets, to snarle thee in thy way:
And have procured, for thy best intents,
Reproves, Contempts, and Close Imprisonments;
(As rigo^ous as ever were inflicted,
Of those that for High Treason stood convicted)
Yea, that which might an honest wealth have won thee,
^as that, whereby they sought to have undone thee.
Foul Scandals, thy best actions have attended.
And (as if on thine Infamy depended
The Kingdoms glory) Pamphlets false and base,
Yea, public Ma^ques, and Plays, to thy disgrace,
Were set abroach; till justly they became,
To those that made, and favored them, a shame.
In Rimes, and Libels, they have done thee wrongs;
Thou have been mentioned in their drunken Songs,
Who nothing worse unto thy charge could lay,
But, that, thou did not seem so bad as they.
Mere Strangers, who are quite unknown of thee,
(Although they see not what thy manners be)
Take pleasure to traduce thee, and to draw
Those things in question, which they never saw.
Nay, at their public meetings, few forbear
To speak that s^andall, which they think, or hear*
Even since this Plague began, and whi^st thy hand
Recording was that Judgment on this Land;
Thou art informed, that, Westward from this place
(Some scores of miles) a general rumor w^^
Both of thy biding here, and of thy death.
And, they who said, thou had expired thy breath,
(Supposing, as it seems) it could not be
That God from this Disease would shelter thee)
Reported also, that, of Grace forsaken,
And, by the sin of Drunkenness o'retaken,
Thou brok^st thy neck. It may be those men thought,
That when the Plague ^hy life to end bad brought,
They should have added som^what, to have slain
The life of good Report, which might remain.
Nor was that aim quite void. For, (though of all
Gross sins, the stain of that, least b^ur thee shall)
Some straight believed what malice did surmise;
Condemned thy Virtues, for Hypocrisies.
Made guilty all thy Lines of evil ends*
Used thee, as Job was used by his friends*
Did on thy Life un^hristian Censures pass*
Affirmed, thy Death had showed what it was;
And, many a one that heard it, shall not know
Until his dying day, it was not so.
But, then they shall perceive, that most of that
Is false, which men of others use to prate.
But, wonder it is none, that thou among
Some Strangers, in thy Fame have suffered wrong:
For, ^o, thy Neighbors (though they privy be
To no such act as may difparage thee,
But unto many rather, which in show,
Appeared from a Christian mind to flow)
Even they, in private whisp'rings, many times
Have taxed thee as guilty of those crimes
Thou never perpetratedst, but do more
Abhor them, then do Mizers to be poor.
And from th^se blots the more thy life is free,
The more is theirs defilde, by slaundring th^e.
In wicked Places (where yet never came
Thy foo^) some ac^ed follies in thy name:
That others present, knowing not thy face,
Might spread abroad of thee, to thy disgrace,
What others did. And, such a mischief, none
But perfect Malice, could have thought upon.
Thy very Prayers, and thy Charities
Have ^^cked been, and judged hypocrisies.
When thou were be^^ employed, thou were s^re
The b^sest imputations to endure.
When thy intentions have been most sincere,
Men's misconstructions always ha^shest were;
And, when thy piou^^ action thou had wrought,
Then* they the greatest mischief on thee brought.
The best, and most approved of those Lays,
By thee composed for thy Makers praise;
Have lately greatly multiplied thy F^es,
And, not procured alone the spite of those
Whom brutish Ignorance bes^ts among
The misconceiving and ill^terate throng:
But* they who on the seats of Judgment sat,
Thee, and those Labors have inveighed at.
The Learned, who should wiser men have been,
Did censure that which they had never seen.
Even they, w^o make fair shows of sancti^y,
(God grant, it be not with hypocrisi^)
With spightfulnesse, that scarce can matched be,
Have shamefully tr^duced that, and thee.
Nay, of the Clergy, some (and of the chief)
Have with unseemly f^ry, post belief,
So undervalu'd, and so vilifi'd
Those Labors (which the trial will abide,
When their proud spleen is wasted) that, unless
God had, in mercy, curbed their furiousness,
(And by his might abated, in some measure,
That power of acting their impe^ious pleasure)
Their place, and that opinion they had gained,
Of knowledge, and sincerity unfeigned,
Had long ere this, no doubt, made so contemned
Those Lines, and thee; that thou had been condemned
Without a trial. And so true a feeling
Had gained ere now, of base and partial dealing,
That, Disconten^ ^ight then have urged thy stay,
In hope this Plague, would that, have took away:
But, thou by others, have received the ^^ings
Of Malice* otherwise, in other things.
Those men, whose over-grosse and open crime^,
Are justly taxed in thi^^ ^onest ^imes,
Have by the general notice of thy name,
Sought how to bring thee to a general shame,
By raising causeless rumors to be blown
Through every quarter where thy lines are known.
For, there is no place without an envious ^are,
And slan^rous tongues be ready every where,
To cast, with willingness, disgrace on those,
Of whom, some good report, beforehand, goes.
And since thou can not answer every man,
As he that is known in some few Townships, can;
The falsest Rumors Men divulge of thee,
Do soon become a common Fame to be.
Moreover (that less cause there may appear,
Why thou should life desire, or dying fear)
The most affected thing this world contains,
Has tor^ur'd thee with most heartbreaking pains.
For, they whom thou have loved: they to whom
Thou did obliged many ways become:
Yea ^hey who knew thy faithfulness; even they,
Have made their outward kindnesses the way
To make thee most ungrateful seem to be,
Yea, they have heaped more disgrace on thee,
More griefs, and disadvantages, then all
Thy Foes together, bring upon thee shall.
And long pursued have, to thy vexation
Their courses with harsh tricks of ag^ravation;
Yet still pretending Love: which makes the curse,
Of this Affliction twenty times the worse.
I will ^ot say that thou affl^cted art
In this (by them) without thy own desert:
For who perceives in all how he offends?
Or thinks, that God correction causeless sends?
Nor will I say this injury proceeds,
Fromany Malice. For, perhaps, it breeds
From their distempered love. And God to show
Some needfullsecret (which thou best may know
By this experiment) a while does please,
To make thy late Contentments thy Disease.
Thy first Acquaintan^e, who did many a year
Enjoy thy fellowship (and glad appear
To seem thy friends) have wearied out their love,
By length of time; and strangers now do prove.
Thou also see, thy new acquaintance be
Worn out as fast as gotten. For, to thee
Most come, for nothing but to satisfy
Their idle fruitless curiosity:
And, having seen, and found thee but a man,
Their friendship ended, just as it began.
Nay, they who all thy course of life have seen,
And (in appearanc^) have persuaded been,
So well of thy uprightness, as if no^ght
Could move in them, of thee, one ^vill thought:
These, by a little absence, or the sound
Of some untrue Relation (wanting ground)
Do all their good opinion some^ime change;
Suspect thy mann^rs, and themselves ^strange,
So unexpecte^ly* and without cause,
That what to judge of them it makes thee pause*
For they that virtuous are, but in the show,
Do soon suspect, that all men else, are so.
Th^se things are very bitter unto such
Whose hearts are sensible to every touch
Of kindness, and unkindnesse; and they make
Life tedious, where they deep impr^ssion take.
But, many other griefs thy Soul do grind;
And thou by them, art pained in a kind
So diff^ring from the common sense of others,
(Although thy patience much distemper smothers)
That Reason might me thinks contented be,
Thou should pursue thy Death to set thee free.
I spe^ke not this, as if thou did repin^
At these, or any other lots of thine:
Nor to discourage thee, because the World
So little of her Grace on thee has hurled.
For, I would have thee scorn her love; and know
That whether she will favor th^e or no,
I will, in thy due season, make thee rise
To honor, by that way which me^ despise:
Even to those honors, which are greater then
The greatest that conferred are, by men.
And, this I mention, in reproach of them
Whose Pride, thy humble Mufings, does contemn^:
And ^o remember thee, how vain it were,
To seek for life, where such harsh dealings are.
And, as I would not have thee wish to live
^or love of any thing, this world can give:
So, I am loath her troubles should have power
To make thee seek to shorten life an hour.
But rather in contempt of all her spite,
To lengthen it, until pale Envy quite
Consume her self; and thou at last be sent
From hence, victorious, crowned with content.
I therefore, here, persuade thee not to stay*
That vainly thou might fool thy life away:
Or, that some poor applauses may be got;
Or, for such trifling ends as profit not;
And, whereof, Reason her di^like infers:
For, my opinion jumps in that, with hers.
I do not counsel thee to cast aside
That care* which teaches wisely to provide
For wholesome Antidotes: Or to observe
Such courses, a^ are likely to preserve
Thy body sound: nor is it my intent,
Thou should employ, by way of complemen^,
Thy time in visiting infected friends;
When to their comfortings it little tends.
Nor am I pleased in him that so presumes,
Or such a frantic foolishness assumes,
As desperately to thrust himself among
The noisome brea^hings of a sickly thro^g,
When such a danger nothing may avail:
And, where the means of lif^ will surely fail.
Nor would I now betray thee to thy sin;
Or work thy losses, that thy foes may win;
Or make thee tempt thy God; or grieve thy friends*
Or bar thy Labors of their wished ends:
Nor can^^t thou think thy Reason well has said,
To cast such stumbling-blockes, as she has laid:
For, just and comely things, I do advise;
And, seek not Mischiefs, but their Remedies.
A carnal Wisdom says she sees not
What knowledge and assurance may be got
Of those eternal things, that objects are
Of Chr^stian hope. But, wherefore should thou fear
What ^lesh and Blood blasphemously has said?
Since, into thee already are convaid
^^th Notions, and the real sense of that
Which they, who would not see, do stumble at?
Mere humane Reason cannot ^each to know
Of many thousand Creatures here below,
The s^cret natures: Do not wonder thou,
That few celestial things perceive she can:
But call to mind, that to be fl^shly wise,
Is to be foolish in Truths Mysteries.
Give God the praise, who has on thee bes^owne
A better apprehension then thine (...).
Remember still, to cherish this belief;
Let Prayer daily fet thy Faith relief:
And be assured that I advise thee best,
What e're thy carnal Reason shall suggest.
If thou suppose that thou have ought begun,
Which may thy Coun^ry profit, being done,
Or honor God: proceed thou in his name,
With cheerfulness, and finish up the same.
For God will either give thee life to do it,
(If cause the^e be) or call another to it
Of better gifts* And, if thou grudge at this,
Thou seek thine own honor, more then his:
And, though a pious purpose thou pretend,
Thy holy shew^s have some unholy end.
Say, thou among the m^ltitude must fall;
Say, they that hate thee, thereof triumph shall;
Or others (out of levity) contemn
Thy course; or thee unj^stly should condemn,
As Reason pleads? what prejudice to thee
Wo^ld this be more, then such men's pra^ses be?
What harm is this to thee when ^hou art gone?
And have no sense of any wrong that is done?
What needst thou care, if all the wo^ld suppose
To hell thou sinkest; if thy spirit it goes
The way to heaven? And in that narrow path
A ^lessed being, unperceived has?
Pursue brave Actions, as a Christian ought,
And, care not thou what shall of them be thought:
(Except to rouse up other men it be,
By making them perceive what rouzed thee)
When thou do walk uprightly, walk thou on,
And scorn to look aside, who looks thereon:
For* he is a fool (if not an hypocrite)
That in well-doing feels no delight,
Until some witness of his deeds he know,
Or feel some praises his proud sai^es to blow,
Nay, he that cannot in a virtuous deed,
(Wherein, his Conscience, warrants to proceed)
Persist without returning, though he should,
Of all the world together, be controlled;
Or, if he thought it not a favor too
That God would call him such a work to do;
(Yea though that for his pains, he should become
Abhorred of all men* t^ll the Day of Doom)
Even such a Man is far below that height,
To which by perfect Virtue climb he might;
And lose he does, by fears that are in vain,
The bravest honor that his Faith can gain.
Thy Reason says, that thou a sinner art;
And, thereupon does urge thee to depart.
But wherefore should the guilt of sin ^ffright
F^^m staying, rather then from taking flight?
For, if thou shall remove away from hence,
Thy guilt retaining, by impenitence,
God has not so his Plagues confined hither,
But that they may pursue thee any whither.
And whereas here, the danger, and the fear,
Encompassing this place, might so deter,
So mollify, and awe thy heart within thee;
So move, and to amend thy life, so win thee,
That God shall cleanse thy soul of every stain;
And reconcile thee to himself again:
Perhaps, the wicked vain securit^,
That will attend thee whither thou shall fly,
May m^ke the measure of thy sins compleater,
Thy comforts fewer; t^y afflictions greater;
When least thou fear, most of all disease thee;
And keep off this, that some worse thing may seize thee:
And, though thy Reason urge thee to beeleve,
Thy friends may wronged be, or too much gri^ve,
By this adventure: I, thy Faith, assure thee,
That if my Motives may to stay procure thee,
(For such good purposes as I propose)
Thy God shall pay thy friends what ere they lose;
Make some (by fearing what thy dangers are)
Of their own ways to take the greater care:
K^epe others (by preserving of them sad)
More watchful, that might else less heed have had*
And, sti^re up thee for them, and them for thee,
So zealous in continual vows to be,
As w^ll (perchance) worse perils drive away,
Then those, which are so feared, in thy stay.
Oh! God, how many souls, by fleeing hence
Escape this, and catch a deadlier Pestilence!
How many hearts whom Fear does somewhat strike
With sorrows, which begins Repentance-like,
(And might by staying here, accomplish that,
Which every true Believer aims at)
Will fall from those beginnings, by their flight,
And lose the feeling of Gods Iudgement^, quite?
How many! by wr^ng seeking to prevent,
Their heavenly Fathers loving chastisement,
Incor^igible in their lives will grow?
And bring themselves to utter overthrow?
And oh! what multitudes, by staying here,
Shall change their dread, into a filial fear?
Their fear to love, and love, and laud thee too,
For sending that, which they abhorred so!
Like them, who in the Deeps employed be,
Here, thou the wondrous works of God shall see.
That thou may tell ^he world what he has done;
And sing the praise of that Almighty-One
To this, and future a^es. And* for what
Did he thy Soul and Body first create?
For what redeem thee? For what end infuse
That Fa^ulty, which thou do call thy Muse?
For what, but for his honor, to declare
Thos^ Judgments and his Mercies which will h^re
Be shown unto thee? and to sing the Story
Of wh^t thine eye beholds to his glory?
For, if not here, then where? Or if not now,
Then, at what other time expectest thou
So fair an oprortunity, to show
With how much readiness thou could be^tow
Thy life, and all thy faculties, on him
(And, for his servic^) who bestowed them?
What nobl^r Subject can the wo^ld afford,
For thee, or for the Muses to record,
Then will those Judgments, and those Mercies be*
Which God will in this place disclose to thee?
If Reason seek some purpose in thy stay,
Me thinks, this purpose please thy Reason may:
For, though those men who love their own vain praise,
Have little care of their Creators ways,
And find small pleasingnesse in those Relations,
Which are composed of such like Observations;
Yet, all the glorioust acts of greatest Kings,
A^e trivial, worthless, base, and foolish things*
Respecting these. And, though some nicer wits
Scarce think that such a Subject well befits
Their artfull Muses. Yet, twixt this and that
Whereon they love to plod and meditate,
There Is much more difference, then between their Laie^
And those which they do most of all dispraise:
And they who live (the time) I hope shall see,
These Poems, much, more prized then they be:
Yea, though it may appear to common Reason,
An act impertinent, and out of season,
For such an end as this to make thy stay:
Let not her carnal Sophismes thee dismay.
For sin^e thou see a vain Historian dares
His person to adventure in the wars,
That he (for fame, or hire) may w^i^e a story
Of wha^ is done to his Commanders glory:
This action, wherefore should thou startle from,
As if thy Judgment it would mis-become?
If just it be, our safeties to contemn,
In such a case (if that be good in him)
How much more just, is thy adventure, then
Who sin^^t the praise of God, and not o^ men?
How much more safely walk thou, then they?
How much more glory, and how much more pay,
Can thy great Captain give thee? And how small
Should be thy fear? If thou should fear at all.
Nor to thy God, or to thy self alone,
Will acceptable services be done
By sta^ing here: but, peradventure some
That living are, and some, in time to come,
May reap advantage by it, and confess,
That thou were borne for them; and did possess
And use thy life, not for thy self alone,
But that to others profit might be done.
The general notice which men take of thee,
Will make thy actions more observed be
Then those of twenty others, who do seem
In their small circuits, men of great esteem:
And, when hereafter it is known abroad,
To what good purposes thou made abode
In this afflicted City: on what ground,
Thy blamed resolution thou do found:
How sensible thou were of every sear,
And of each peril thou adventredst here:
How many friends thou ^adst to fly unto:
How much elsewhere thou migh^st have found to do;
What Censures thou should hazard, in t^y stay:
VV^at pleasures wooed th^e to come aw^y:
How, thy continuing here was not by chance
By discontent, or humorous ignorance:
How, no compulsion, no persuading Friend,
No office, hope o^ gain, or such like end
Nec^ssitated thee. Yea, when by such,
Who are to fear e^slaved ^vermuch,
All this is heeded well; And when men shall
Consider it, comparing therewithal,
What causes moved thee; what meditation
Confirmed thy stay; what kind of conversation
Thou daily practisedst; and what good use
They may from the experiments produce;
It will perchance occasion some to learn
Those things, which yet they do not well discern:
Help, in good Resolutions, some to arm:
Some weak ones in temptations much confirm:
To some become a means to make them see
That men despised, may enabled be,
By Faith, to keep their place undaunted there,
Where men of better seeming gifts do f^are.
And peradventure thou may compass that
Which likeher men in vain have aimed at*
For, though it may be said this place has store
By Calling and by Gifts, adapted more
For such a task; and that there may be some,
That have no warrant for departing from
Th^se noisome streets, who well enough may take
This pain^s; and thereof thee excused make.
Yet, shall not that ^xcuse thee. For, all they
Have Callings, which employ them wholly may*
Yea, they whose wits are ^bler, think not on
That work, perchance* as needful to be done.
Or if they do, perhaps, they may expire
Before they have performed it; or tire.
And though they should make perfect their designs:
Yet their obs^urity, may bar their Lines
From taking that effect, which if thou write,
Thy being far more known, accomplish might.
For, Fame prevails with many (now adays)
And, if uncout^'d, unkist (as Chaucer says.)
Or grant that many had the same attempted,
(And men of note) yet were thou not exempted.
For, best it is, when such like things as these
Confirmed are by many witnesses.
Beside, if those assurances which thou
Shall publish (and thy ^aith shall well allow)
Affirmed were by none but such as they
Who might not from this place depart aw^y
Without much loss, or blame: mere natural men
Might have contemned all those counsels, then,
And all those just reproves, that may, by thee,
Or any other man objected be,
Against their flavish Fears: and may reply,
That no man staid, but he that could not fly:
Or that none durst become a voluntary,
In such a Fire, for conscience sake* to tarry:
And, that no mortal man had power obtained
To bide such brunts, till outwardly constrained.
Whereas thy free abiding here, will move
Much better thoughts: thy constancy approve;
Procure the more belief to thy Relations;
The more effectual make thy good persuasions:
And stop their mo^thes, who might some other w^y
Thy paine^ have wronged, had ought proc^r'd thy stay.
Oh! f^r, far be it, that Lust, Ava^ce,
The strong d^^^empers of some hat^f^ll Vice,
A stupid Mel^ncholy or the tumors
Of some wild Passion, or fantasti^ke Humor^,
Should fix more stoutnesse in the heart of man,
Then temperate, an^ pious knowledge can.
Far be it, that old women, for their pay,
Or Sextons for as little b^re, as they,
We in the w^lks of Death should walking see
Without all f^are; yet, they deterred be,
Who boast of knowl^dge; and have sung, and said,
That though in Deaths black shadows they were lai^*
They would without dism^y continue th^re;
Because Gods Rod, and Staff, their keepers are.
Oh! let not this be so: And be it far
From proving true; that they who studious are
Of Wisdom, and of Piety, should shrink,
Where he, whose head piece is but armed with drink*
Sits fearlesse: Or, that Use, or Custom shall
Embolden more, then Christian Faith, and all
The Moral Ve^tues: Or, that thou should yield
To carn^ll Reason, and forgo the Field.
More Arguments I could, as yet, express,
To prove thy staying has much usefulness:
As that it were unkindnesse to forsake
Those persons here, who comfort in thee take.
For, some profess already, that they bide,
By thy example, greatly fortified,
(In their compelled stay) by seeing thee
So willingly, the^r griefs companion be.
Y^a, many a one, observing thee to stay,
Confesses, he does shame to fly away.
Thereby, those Resolutions they have got,
Which very lately they embraced not;
And might, perhaps, if now thou should depar^*
Become afraid, because thou fearful art.
Me thinks, it is unmanlinesse to fly
From those, in woe, whom in prosperity
Thou lovedst: yea, it is baseness, not to share
In ^v'ry sorrow which thy f^iends d^e bear,
As well as in their pleasures, if they be
Such friends, as some of thine do seem to thee.
Here, thou have long continued. On the bread
Of Dainties, in this City thou have fed.
Here, thou have laughed and sung; and here thou have
Thy youthful years, in many f^llies past;
Abused thy Christian-liberty, and trod
That Maze, which brings forgetfulness of God.
Here, thy example, some corrupted has;
Here, thou have moved thy Creators wrath:
Here, thou have sinned; and thy sins they were,
Which help to bring this Plague now raging here.
Here, therefore, do thou fast: here, do thou mourn,
And, into sighs, and tears, thy laughter turn.
H^re, yield ^hy self to prison, till thou see
At this Assize, how God will deal by thee:
Even here, the time redeem thou: here, restore
B^ good examples, th^se whom heretofore
Thou have offended: here, t^y self apply
Gods just incensed wrath to pacify.
Here, join in true Repen^ance, to remove
that Storm which now descends from above.
And the^, or live or dye* this Place, to thee
A place of Refuge, and of ^oy shall be.
Nor Sin, nor Death, nor H^ll, no^ any thing
Shall d^scontentment, fea^e, or peril bring
Which to thy Soul or Body, shall become
A disadvantage; but help save thee from
Destruction: Joys, as yet, unfelt, procure:
In all temptation, mak^ thy mind secure:
Discover plainly how thy Reason failed;
And, make thee bless the time, thy Faith prevailed.
But, thou do w^nt a Calling (REASON cries)
Thy staying in this place to warrantize.
And, that until thereof tho^ do obtain
The full assurance, all my speech is vain.
Indeed, the glorioust work we can begin,
Unless God call us to it, is a sin.
And therefore, every man should seek to k^ow
What, God, and what vain ^ancy calls him to.
For, Pride* and overweening Arrogance,
The Devil, or a zealous Ignorance,
Suggests false warrants; and allureth men
To dangerous adventures, now and then:
Yea, makes some, from God^ commands to fall,
And take employments at the Devils call.
To judge thy Calling, then, learn this of me,
That, some Vocations ordinar^ be,
Some extraordinary If thou take
An ordinary Calling, thou must make
The common entrance, which that power does give
Within whose Jurisdiction thou do l^ve:
Else (whatsoever Cause thou do pretend)
It is Intrusion: and, thou shall offend.
If thou conceivest thou some Calling have
In Extraordinary; see it past
By Gods allowance, from Gods holy Writ*
Before such time as thou accept of it.
And, then, beware that nothing force thee back,
Or, make thee in thine Office to be slack.
In brief; a Calling extraordinary,
To justify it self, these Marks must carry;
And, if it fail of them, but in the least,
Thy Conscience is deluded in the r^st.
Gods glory will be aimed at, in chief:
It will be grounded on a true belief:
It does not Gods revealed will oppose:
No step that erres from Charity it goes:
It seeks not, what cannot be enjoyed:
It makes no ordinary calling void:
Some cause not frequent must invite thereto:
And ( to accomplish what thou have to do)
Some Gift, that is proper for it, must be given,
And then, thou have thy Calling sealed from h^aven.
Approve thy self by these, and thou shall see,
That, God, no doub^, has truly called thee.
To this adventure. For, thy heart intends
His praise in this, above all other ends.
Thou do bele^ve, that (whether live or dye)
Thy st^y shall somewhat add, to glorify
Thy blessed Maker; and that something shall
To thine, and others profits, here, befall.
Thy Judgment, to thy Conscience nou^ht discloseth,
Wherein it Gods revealed Will opposes:
It well agrees with Charity, and tryes
To compass no impossibilities.
Nor binders it, nor calls it th^e from ought
Which is more necessary to be wrought.
A Cause not ordinary now requires
Thy presence here; and, God himself inspires
Thy B^est with Resolutions that agree
To such an a^tion. Gi^ts, which none but he
Can give, he gives thee; such, as are by Nature,
Not found in any sub^oelestiall Creature,
But, me^rly of his Grace ^ and, such, as none
Can counterfeit, by all that may be done.
And, whence are all th^se Musiags here expressed?
Wh^nce come these combatings within thy breast
Twixt M^ and Reason? who is it that makes
Thy heart so fearlesse, now such horror shakes
The souls of others? what embolden can
The frightfull spirit of a natural man,
In such apparent dangers to abide?
And yet, his Reason nothing from him hide,
That seems to be dreadful; neither leave him
Such Aims, or such like Passions to deceive him,
As harden others? Who, but he, that gives
Each p^rfit Gift, these Gifts to thee deriveth?
And sure he naught bestows, but therewithal
He sends occasions that employ is shall.
Few Officers shall w^nt a doubtfulnesse
That they their places doubtfully possess,
If this be doubtful; whether God (or no)
Has called thee to what I bid thee do.
For, outward Callings, most men do, or may
Intrude upon, by some sinister way:
By Symony, by Bribe^y, by Spoils,
By open Violence, or secret Wiles.
And therefore (though the Se^les of Kings they gain
To strengthen what unduly they obtain)
Some doubting of their Callings may be had
To God ward, though such doubts be rarely made.
But, for thy Calling thou Commission have
So firm; and it so many Seals has past,
That nothing should induce thee to suspect
Thy Warrant, or distrust a good effect.
God, from thy Cradle, seems to have ordained thee
To such a purpose: for, he yearly trained thee
Through several cares, and perils, so inure
Thy heart, to what he meant thou should endure:
Else why should thou (whose actions honest were
To Man ward, though to God ward foul they are)
Be more for that afflicted, which does seem
(To some) a work deserving good esteem,
Then are a multitude in these our times,
Convicted of the most notorious crimes?
Why, at thy very birth, did he infuse
Thy Soul with na^urall helps to form thy Muse,
Which is a Faculty not lent to many,
Nor by mere Art attained to, of any?
To thee, why gave he Knowledge, such a way
As others l^se it by? And why I pray
Did he bestow upon thee so much Fame
For those few childish lines that thou did frame
In thy minority* Why did he then
(When scarce a man) enroule thy Name with men?
And make thee to be praised and prized before
Those men whose Years, and Sciences are more?
What was there in thy Poems? what in thee,
That seemed not worthy of contempt to be,
Much more then of applause? And what have thou
From scorn to save thee, but Gods mercy now?
Believe it, he divulgeth not thy Name
For thine own honor: But to make the same
A means of spreading his. From p^rills past
He saved not thee, for any worth thou have,
But, to declare his Mercies At this season,
He moves this plea betwixt thy Faith and Reason,
Not to be passed over, as in vain;
But, in thy Breast true courage to maintain.
Thy Muse he gave thee, not to exercise
Her power in b^se and fruitless vanities,
Or to be silenced: but, to magnify
The wondrous workings of his Majesty.
And, as the seals of Kings authorize those
To whom they do their Offices dispose,
So, these are Signs which force enough do carry
To seal this calling extraordinary:
And, they who slight the same will in some measure
Incur the King of heavens high displeasure.
More might be said (hereof to make a proof)
But, more to say, were more then is enough.
Of this, no further, therefore, I Will dispute;
But, bid thee stay, thy Place to execute.
When FAITH had made this pleading in my breast
My REASON was persuaded to protest
Her full assent, to what she first gainsaid,
Which, that it might be constantly obeyed,
My Conscience, in her Court, did soon decree;
And, all my thoughts were then at peace in me.
From that time forward, neither Friend, nor Foe,
Could startle me in what I meant to do.
No vain desires within me did controul^
My purpose: no distrusts did fright my soul:
Nor seemed it, so dangerous, to stay,
As (knowing what I ^new) to fly away.
For, though these Arguments, and such as these,
Can never fit in all men's Consciences,
The just Meridian (seeing, variations,
In manifold respects, make alterations)
Yet, mine they suited with; and may, and shall
Be some way useful, to my Readers all.
I wished it so: For, I was then inspired
With love to all* and all men's weal desired.
Me thought, I pitied those, who should not see
What God within this place did show to me:
And should have grieved to have been constrained,
Within the City, not to have remained.
For by my self, when I to censure b^ought
My present Lot; it pleased me: and, me thought,
That, Go^ vouch^afed to employ me so,
And furnish me for what I was to do,
With such a healthful body, and a mind
To act his will so readily inclined;
It seemed more comfort, and more honor far,
Then if a Mona^kes Favorite I were,
Or might for temporal respects become
The noblest person of all Christendom.
A^ ^, if I shall not still this mind embrace,
A dog half hanged is in better case.
For, when that favor I do value less,
I shall grow senseless of all happiness.
Oh! God, how great a blessing, then, did thou
Confer upon me? And what Grace allow!
Oh! what am I, and what my parentage?
That Thou of all the Children of this Age
Did choose ou^ m^, so highly to prefer,
As of thy Acts, to be a Register?
And g^ve me Fortitude and Resolution,
To stay, and view thy Judgments execution?
That, I should live to see thy Angel here,
Even in his grea^est dreadfulnesse appear?
That, when a thousand fell before my face,
And at my right hand (in as little space)
Ten thousand more, I should be still prot^cted
From that contagious blast, which them infected!
That, when of Arrows thou d^dst shoot a flight
So thick by day, and such a storm by night
Of pois^ned shaft* I, then, should walk among
The sharpest of them; and yet pass along
Vnharm'd* And that I should behold the path
Which thou do pace in thy hot burning wrath,
(Yet not consume to Ashes) what a wonder
To me it seems, when thereupon I ponder!
How great a grace it was, whose tongue can say,
That I who am but breathing dust and clay,
Should waking (and in all my senses, well)
Walk down the Grave almost as low as hell,
Yet come again unscar^ed? and have leave
To live and tell what there I did perceive!
Yea come (as from the dead) again to show
The faithless wo^ld what terrors a^e below!
(And justify, that though a man be sent
Even from the Grave to move men to repent,
No Faith would in those hearers be begot,
Who Moses and the Prophets credit not.)
How great a Mercy was it, that when I
Was thought in dangers, and in griefs to lie,
That, for my Shepherd I had thee my God?
And in the p^th of best contentments trod?
That I, on sweetest Pleasures banqueted,
When other men did eat Afflictions bread?
That, I had perfect joys even in my tears?
Assured ^afety in my greatest foares?
A thousand ^omforts, whereof they who lived
In better-seeming states, w^^e quite deprived?
And much content, which they will never know,
Who keep those paths in which the Vulgar go.
What ma^^hlesse benefits were these! and whence
Can thou, that gav'st them, have thy recompense,
But from thy self* Or who but ^hou alone
Can give me heart enough to think upon
These Gr^ces as I o^^ht? Oh! therefore, daigne
To make my breast suffici^nt to contain
That measure of due thankfulness, which may
Accepted be, for what I cannot pay.
And, suffer not my frailties, or my sin
To hide again, what thou do now begin
To make me see; but grant to me thy grace,
For ever, to behold thy cheerf^ll face.
Nor Oil, nor Corn, nor Wine can glad me so:
Nor shall their brutish lovers ever know
What joys within my breast begotten be,
When thy pleased countenance does shine on me.
Let those who of great Kings affections boast,
(And for their ^avours are engaged most)
Those, who possess (their starveling souls to please)
Sweet Gardens, Groves, and cu^ious Palaces,
Rich Jewels, large Revenues, princely Styles,
The flatteries of Lords, and female smiles,
The pleasures of the Chamber, and the Fields,
All those which dainty fare, or Music yields,
The City or the Court; and all tha^ stuff
Of which their hearts can never have enough:
Let these, and those who their desires approve,
With such entising Objects fall in love:
Let them pursue their fancies, till they find
What so^rowes and disgraces come behind:
And let the^ ^urfet on them, till they see
By tried experience, what their fruit will be.
I never shall ^nvy their happiness;
Nor cove^ their high for^unes to possess,
If thou p^eserve m^ still in thy protection,
And cheer my spirit by thin^ eyes reflection*
For then I shall not fear the scorns of such*
My ^ares, (...) shall never grieve me much:
I shall not (...) to ^rouch and sue to them,
Who thee, and me, and ve^tue shall contem^e*
I shall nor shrink nor startle, when I hear
Those evil tidings, which men daily fear.
Not leave my standing, though that in the room
Of this great Pestilence, a War should come.
Or (which were wo^se) anot^er Fiery-triall,
To ^orce us, of thy Truth to mak^ denial.
And, in these fearful times, no temporal bliss
Would seem a greater privilege then this,
To those, who now with trembling souls, expect
What our proceedings will at last ^ffect.
Yea, they, perhaps, who now are stupifi'd,
Will praise my lot, when they their chance have tried.
But (though even all men living should despise
The comfort of it) I the same will prise.
I praise thee for it, LORD, and here emplore.
That I may praise thee for it, evermore:
That these expressions of thy love to me,
May helpful also to thy praises be
In other men: And (if it may be so)
In other times, and other places too:
And, that the showing how I did compose
The wa^re which twixt my Faith and Reason ros^,
May teach some others how they should debate
Such doubts within themselves; and arbitrate
(Within their Co^rt of Conscience) what is fit
To be concluded, and so practice it.
For, why so largely, I have this expressed,
That, was not, of my p^rposes, the least.
I beg moreover, that I may pursue
To utter that which I have yet to show.
And, that nor Sloth, nor Want, nor any Let,
May to these Po^^es their last period set,
Till I have made my Readers to conceive,
That this was undertaken by thy leave*
And, that my Censurers may come to say,
There was an useful purpose in my stay:
Or show me what they did; or, what I might
Have done to better uses in my flight.
(...) I lastly, crave (which is, I trust, begun)
That, I ^he way of thy Commands may run,
The remnant of my Talent, and my days,
Employing in good actions, to thy praise:
That, I, for ever, may those paths refuse
Which may unhallow, or pervert my Muse:
And that, when this is done, I may not fall
Through Pride or Sloth; as if this act were all:
But, humbly strive such other wo^kes to do,
As thou r^quir'st, and I was borne unto.
Yea fu^nish me with every thing by which
I best may se^ve thee, and I shall be rich.
This beg I, LORD; and nothing else I crave,
For, more then that, were less then naught to have:
I beg of thee, nor Fame, nor mortal praise,
Nor carnal pleasures, nor yet length of days,
Nor honors, nor vain wealth, but, just what may
The Charges of my Pilgrimage defray.
Oh grant me ^his; and hear me when I call:
For, if thou stand not by me, I shall fall.
The fourth Canto.
Our Muse, in this fourth Canto, writes
Of melancholy thoughts, and sights:
Wha^ changes were in ^very place;
What Ruins in a little space:
How Trades, and how provisions failed;
How ^orrow thrived, how Death prevailed;
And, how in (...) he did ri^e*
With all his horrors, by his side.
To LONDON, then, she does declar^
How suting her afflictions were
To former sins: what good and bad
Effects, this Plague produced had:
What friendly Champions, and what Foes
For us did fight, or us oppose:
And, how the greatest Plague of all
On poor Artificers, did fall.
Then, from the Fields, new grief she takes,
And, useful Meditations makes:
Relates, how flowly Vengeance came,
How, God forewarned us of the same:
What other Plagues to this were joined:
And, here and there are interlined
Vpbraidings, warnings, exhortations,
And, pertinent expostulations.
WHen Conscience had allowed my Commission,
For staying, and declared on what condition;
I did not only feel my heart consent
To entertain it, with a full content,
But also, found my self prepared so
To execute the work I had to do,
That without pain (me thought) I was employed,
And all my Passions to good use enjoyed.
For, though God fre^d my soul from slavish fear,
Ye^, so much awe he still preserved there,
As kept within my heart some natural sense
Often is displeasure, and of penitence
He gave me Joys, yet left some Grief withal,
Lest I into security might fall;
Or* lose the fellow-feeling of that pain,
Whereo^, I heard my neighbors to complain.
He lent me health: yet, every day some twitches
Of pangs unusual; many qualme^, and stitches
Of short continuance, my poor heart assailed,
That I might heed the more what others ayled.
He kept me hopeful: and yet, now and then,
His rods (wherewith* in love, he scourges men)
Did make me smart; lest else I might assume
The liberty of Wantons, and presume.
My ordinary means was made their prey,
Who seek my spoil, and lately took away.
Yet, me with plenties, daily did he feed,
And I did nothing wan^, which I could need,
Which God vouchsafed to assure to me,
That when unusual works required be;
He will (e're we shall want what is necessary)
Supply us by a means, not ordinary.
By many other signs, unmention'd here,
Gods love, and providence, did so appear,
And so me thought engage me, to remove
What ever to his work a let might prove;
That (so far forth as my frail nature could
Admit, and things convenient suffer would)
My own Affairs aside, a while I threw,
And bent my self, with heedfulnesse, to view
What, worth my notice, in thi^ Plague I saw,
O^, what good uses I from thence might draw.
But, ^arre I needed not to pace about,
Nor long enquire to find such Objects out.
For, every place with sorrows then abounded,
And every way the cries of Mourning sounded.
Yea* day by day, successively till night,
And from the evening till the morning light,
Were Sc^e^es of Grief, with strange variety*
Knit up, in one continuing Tragedy.
No sooner waked I, but twice twenty knels,
And many sadly-sounding passing-bels,
Did greet mine ear, and by their heavy towles,
To me gave notice, that some early souls
Departed whilst I slept: That other some
Were drawing onward to their longest home;
And, seemingly, presaged, that many a one
Should bid the world goodnight, e're it were noon^.
One while the mournful Tenor, in her tones
Did yield a sound as if in deep for groans,
She did bewail the sorrow which attends
The separation of those loving friends,
The Soul and Body. Other while, again,
Me thought, it called on me, and other men
To pray, that God would view them with compassion*
And give them comfortable separation.
(For, we should with a fellow-feeling, share
In every sorrow, which our brethren bear)
Sometime my Fancy tuned so the Bell*
As if her Towlings did the story tell
Of my mortality, and call me from
This life, by often, and loudly sounding, Come.
So long the solitary nights did last,
That I had leisure my accounts to cast;
And think upon, and over-think those things,
Which darkness, loneliness, and sorrow brings
To their consideration, who do know,
From whence they came, and whither they must go.
My Chamber entertained me all alone,
And in the rooms adjoining lodged none.
Yet, through the darksome silent night did fly
Sometime an uncouth noise; sometime a cry,
And sometime mournful callings pierced my room,
Which came, I neither knew from whence, nor whom.
And, often betwixt awaking and asleep,
Their voices who did talk* or pray, or weep,
Unto my listening ears a passage found,
And troubled me, by their uncertain sound.
For, though the sounds themselves no terror we^e*
Nor came from any thing that I could fear;
Yet, they b^ed Musings; and those musings bred
Conjecturings, in my half sleepi^g head:
By those Conjectures into mind were broug^t
Some real things, before quite out of thought;
They, diverse Fancies to my soul did show,
Which m^ still further, and still further drew
To follow them; till they did thoughts procure
Which humane frailty cannot long endure:
Even such, as when I fully was awake,
Did make my heart to tremble, and to a^e.
And, when such frailties have disheartened men*
Oh! God, how busy is the Devil then?
I know in part his malice, and the ways
And times, and those occasions which he lays
To work upon our weakness; and there is
Scarce any which does show him like to t^is.
I partly also know by what d^g^ees
He works it; how he does gain or leese
Hi^ labors; and some sense I have procu^'d,
What p^ngs are by the soul that while endured.
For, though my God, in mercy, has indu'd
My Soul with Knowledge, and with Fortitud^
In such a measure, that I do not fear
(Distractedly) those tortures which appear
In solitary da^kness^: yet, some part
Of this, and of all frailties in my heart
Continues he; that so I might confess
His mercies with continual thankfulness,
And, somewhat (^vermore) about me bear,
Which unto me my frail^ies may declare.
Yea (thou^h without distemper, now it be)
So much of those grim fears are showed me,
Which terrified my childhood, and which mak^
The hea^ts of a^ed men, sometimes to quake*
That I am s^nsible of their estate;
And can their case the more compassionate,
Who on their beds of ^eath do pained lie,
Exiled from comfort, and from company,
When dreadful Fancies do their souls af^ight*
Begotten by the melancholy nig^t.
Glad was I, when I saw the Sun appear,
(And with his Rays to bless our Hemi^phere)
That from the tumbled bed I might arise,
And with more lightsomnesse refresh mine eyes:
Or with some good companion^, ^ead, or pray,
To pass, the better, my s^d thoughts away:
For, though such ^houghts often us^full are, and good*
Yet, knowing well, I was but flesh and blood,
I also knew man's natural condition
Must have in joys, and griefs, an intermission,
Lest too much joy should fill the heart with folly,
Or, too much grief breed dangerous melancholy.
But, when the Morning came, i^ little showed,
Save light, to see discomfortings renewed:
For, if I staid within, I heard relations
Of naught but dying pang^, and lamentations.
If in the Stre^ts I did my footing set,
With many sad disasters there I met.
And, objects of mortali^y and fear,
I saw in great abundance every where.
Here, one man staggered by, with visage pale:
There, leaned another, grunting on a stall.
A third, half dead, lay gasping for his grave;
A fourth did out at window call, and rave;
Yonn came the Bearers, sweating from the Pit,
To fetch more bodies to replenish it.
A little further off, one sits, and shows
The spots, which he Deaths tokens does suppose,
(E're such they be) and, makes them so indeed;
Which had been signs of heal^h, by taking heed.
For, those round-purple-spot^, which most have thought
Deaths fatal tokens (where they forth are b^ought,)
May prove Life tokens, if that ought be done,
To help the work, which Nature h^th begun.
Whereas, that fear, which their opinion brings
Who threaten Death; the want of cordial things
(To help remove that poison from the heart,
Which Nature has expelled thence in part)
And then, the Sickm^ns liberty of having
Cold drinks, and what his appetite is craving,
Brings back again those humors pestilent,
Which by the vital powers had fo^th been sent.
So by recharging him that was before
Nigh spent, the fainting Combatant gives over:
And he that cheerfully did raise his head,
Is often, in a moment, stricken dead.
Fea^e also helps it forward. Yea, the terror
Occasioned, by their fond and common error,
Who tell the sick^, that marked for Death they be,
(When those bl^w spots upon their flesh they see)
Even that has murthred thousands, who might here
Have lived, ^lse, among us, many a year.
For, if the Surgeons, or the Searchers, know
Those marks, which for the marks of death do go,
From common-spots, or purples, (which we must
Confess, or else all kind of spots d^str^st)
Then, such as we Death-tokens call, were seen
On some, that have long since, recovered been.
Before I learned this, I fixed mine eyes
On many a private man's calamities,
And saw the Streets (wherein a while ago
We s^arce could pass, the people filled them so)
Appear nigh desolate; yea, quite forlorn
And for their wonted visitant^ to mourn.
Much peopled Westminster, where late, I saw,
So many reverend Judges of the Law,
With Clients, and with Suitors hemmed round:
Where Courts and Palaces did so abound
With bus^nesses: and, wh^re, together met
Our Thrones of Justice, and our Mercy-seat;
That place, was then frequented, as you see
Some Villages on Holy Days will be
When half the Towneship, and the Hamlets nigh
Are met to revell, at some Parish, by.
Perhaps, the wronging of the Orphans cause,
Denying, or perverting of the Laws
There practiced, did set this Plague abr^eding,
And sent the Term from Westminster to Reading.
Her goodly Church and Chapel, did appear
Like some poor Minster which has twice a year
Four visitants: And, her great Hall, wherein
So great a Randevow had lately ^in,
Did look like those old Structure^, where long since
Me^ say, King Arthur kept his residence.
The Parliament had left her, to go see
If they could learn at Oxford to agree;
Or if that air were better ^or the health
And safety of our English Common-wealt^.
But there, some did so counsel, and so urge
The Body politic to take a purge,
To purify the parts that seemed foul:
Some others did that motion so ^on^roule,
And plead so much for Cordialls, and for that
Which strengthen might the sinnewes of the State,
That all the time, the labor, and the cost,
Which had bestowed been, was wholly lost.
And, here, the empty House of Parliament
Did l^oke as if i^ had been disco^t^nt,
Or grieved (me thought) that Oxford should not be
More pro^perous, yet; nor c^uld I any see
Res^rt to comfort her: But, there did I
Behold two Traitors hea^s, which perching high,
Did show their teeth, as if they had been grinning
At those Affli^tious which are now beginning.
Yea, their wide ^ye holes, star'd, me thought, as the
They looked ^o see that House now overthrow
It self, which they with Powder up had blown,
Had God, their snares, and them, not overthrown.
White Hall, where not three months before* I spied
Great Britain in the height of all her pride,
And, France with her contending, which could most
Outbrave old Rome and Persi^, in their cost
On Robes and Feasts: Even that lay solitary,
As does a quite-forsaken Monast^ry
In some lone Forest; and we could not pass
To many places, but through weeds and grass.
Perhaps, the sins, of late, committed ^here,
Occasions of such desolation were.
Pray God, there be not others, in the State,
That will make all, a^ last, be desolate.
The Stra^d, that goo^ly thorow-fare between^
The Court and City (and where I have seen
Well nigh a million pa^sing in one day)
Is now, almost, an unfrequented way:
And peradventure, for those impudencies,
Those riots, and those other foul offenses,
Which in that place were frequent, when it had
So great resort; ^t is now justly made
To stand unvisited* God grant it may
Repent* lest longer, and another way
It stand unpeopled, or some others use
Those blessings, which the owners now abuse.
The City-houses of our English P^eres,
Now smoakt as seldom, as in other years
Their Country-palaces: and, they perchance
Much better know then does my ignorance,
Why so it came to pass. But, wish I shall
That they their ways to mind would better call;
Le^t both their Country* and their City-piles,
Be smoking seen, and burning, many miles.
The Innes of Court I entered; and I saw
Each Room so desolate, as if the Law
Had out-lawed all her Students; or that there
Some feared arrestings, where no Sergeants were.
Most dream, that this great fright was thither sent
Not purposely, but came by accident;
And so, but little use is taken from
Gods Judgments, to amend the times to come.
Yet, I dare say, it was a warning given
Even by appointment: and decreed in heaven:
To s^gnifie, that if our Lawyers will
In their abusive ways continue still,
The cause of their profession quite fo^getting*
And to their practices no limits setting,
Till they (as hereto^ore the Clergy were)
Are more in number then the Land can bear.
Their goodly Palaces shall spew them forth,
As excrements that have nor use nor worth;
And, be disposed of, as now they s^e,
The Priories, and Monasteries be.
It grieved me to behold this woeful change,
And places so well known, appear so strange.
But, oh poor LONDON! when I looked on thee,
Remembering therewithal, thy jollity
Erewhile; and how soon after I did meet
With grief and sad complaints in ev'^y street*
When I did mind how throng^d thy Ga^es have bin
And then perceived so few past out or in.
When I considered that abundant store
Of wealth, which thou discover'dst heretofore:
And, looking on thy many empty stalls,
Beheld thy shops set up their wooden-wals*
Me ^hought, thou should^t not be that London, which
Appeared of late so populous, and rich;
But, some large Borough; either falling from
Her height; or, not unto her greatness come.
If to thy Port I walked; it moved remorse,
To see how gr^atly, Trade and Intercourse
Decayed there; and what depopulations,
Were made in thy late peopled habitations.
Thy Royal Change, which was the Randevow
Wherein all Nations met, the whole world through,
Within whose princely walls we heard the sound
Of every Language spoke on Earths vast Round;
And where we could have known what had bin done
In every foreign Coast below the Sun:
That Place, the City-Merchant, and the Stranger
Avoided as a place of certain danger:
And feared (as it seems) they might have had
Some bargain there, that would have spoild their trade
Thy large Cath^drall, whose decaying frame
Thou leavest unrepaired to thy shame,
Had scarce a Walker in her middle I Will;
And, every Ma^ble of tha^ ancient Pile,
Did often drop, and seem to shed forth tears,
For thy late ruin, though thou sleightest hers.
The time has been, that once a day, from thence,
We could have ^^d a large intelligence
Of most occurences, that public were.
Y^a, many times we had* relations there,
Of things, who^e foolish actors never thought
Their deeds to open scanni^g should be brought.
There, heard we often made public by report,
What S^^resi^s were whispered in the Court.
The Closet-Cou^sels, and the Chamber work,
Which many think in privacy does lurk.
There heard we what those Lords, and Ladies were,
Who m^t disguised, ^hey know when, and where.
The^e ^eard we what they did, and what they said;
And many foolish plots were there bew^ai^:
There, heard we reasons, why such men were made
Great Lords and Knights, who no deserving had,
In common view: and how great Pr^nces eyes
Are dazzled and abused wi^h fallacies.
Th^re heard we for what G^f^s most Doctors rise,
And gain the Church^s ^ighest dignities.
The truest causes also there we^e known,
Why men advanced are, or pulled down.
Why Officers are changed, or displaced;
Why some confined are and some di^graced;
And what among the wise, those men do seem,
That are great Stat^smen, in their own es^eeme.
Th^re we have heard, what Princ^s have intended,
When they to do some other thing p^e^ended.
What Policies* and Projects, men pursue*
With public aims, and with a pious s^ew.
Why from the Counsel one is turned out;
What makes another counterfeit the gout,
And many other mysteries beside,
Whith hardly can the mentioning abide.
But those Athenian Merc^antmen were gone,
Who made exchange of News; and few or none
To hear or make reports remained there.
Yea they who scarce a day (as if they were
Of Paul's the walking Statues) staid from thence
Since LONDON felt the last great Pestilence,
Even they were gone; and those void Isles d^d look
As if some properties had them ^orsooke.
Our Theaters, our Tavernes, Tennis-courts,
And Gaming houses whither great resorts
Were w^nt to come; then, seldom were frequented:
Not that such vanities we much repented;
But, lest those places, which had follies taught us,
Might some reward, unlooked for, have brought us.
Where we with Pestilences of the ^oule
Each other had polluted and made foul,
Our bodies were infected; and our breat^s,
Which had endangered our e^ernall de^t^s,
(In former times) by uttring heresies,
By ^candals, and by basest flatteries,
Or wanton speeches; put^ifide the Air,
The blood even at the fountain did impair,
To cool our lust* And they that were the bliss^^
Of some* men's lives, did poison them with kisses.
The Ma^kets which a while before did yield
What air, se^s, riv^rs, garden, wood, or field,
To furnish them afforded; no^ had naught,
But what some few in secret thither brought.
For (as a foresaid) it was ordered so,
That none should with p^ov^sions, come or go.
So, like a Town beleaguered thou did fare,
In some respect^: And, but that God had care
By m^king others feel necessities
Which forced them to minister supplies;
Thou had been famisht, or been feign to b^ing
Provisions in by way of forraging:
And then their foolishness, had brought upon
Those men, two mischiefs, who did fear but one.
Hereafter therefore, practice well to use
Those plenties thou did he^etofore abuse;
Lest God, ^gaine bereave thee of thy sto^e,
And never so enlarge his bounty more.
For, to co^rect thy Surfets, and Excess,
Thy sleighting of the poor, thy thanklesnesse,
And such like sins; God wo^thily rest^ained
Those plenties which thy pride and lust maintained.
Thy Dwellings, from whose windows I have se^n
A thousand Ladies, that might Queens have been
For bravery, and beauty: And, some far
More fair then they that famed in Legends are.
Those s^ood unpeopled, as those ^ouse^ do
Which Sprights, and Fairies do reso^t unto.
None to their closed wicke^s made repai^e;
Their empty gasemen^s gaped wide for air;
And where once foot clot^es and Ca^oches were
Attending; now stood Coffi^s, and a Biere.
Yea Coffins oftener past by every door,
Th^n Coaches, and Caroches, heretofo^e*
To see a country Lady, or a Knight
Among us then, had been a^ rare a sigh^
As was that Elephant which came from Spain,
O^ some great Monster spewd out of the Maine.
If by mischance the people in the street,
A Courtier, or a Gentleman did meet,
They with as much amazement him did view,
As if they had beheld the wand^ing ^ew.
And, many, seeing me to keep this place,
Did look as if they much bewaild my cas^,
And h^l^e belee'vd that I was doomed hither,
That (since close-prison, half a year together,
Nor private wrongs, nor public dis-respect,
Could break my heart, nor much the same deject)
This Plague might kill me, which is come to whip
Those faults which her^tofore my pen did strip.
But here I walked in safety to behold
What changes, for instruction, see I could.
And, as I wandered on, my eye did meet,
Those half built Pageants which, a thwa^t the street,
Did those triumphant Arches counterfeit,
Which heretofore in ancient Rome were fet,
When their victorious Generals had thither
The spoil of mighty kingdoms b^ought together.
The loyal Citizens (^lthough they lost
The glory of their well-intended cost)
E^ected those great Structures to renown
The new receiving o^ the Sov'raigne Crown
By hopeful CHARLES (whose royal exaltation,
Make thou oh! God, propitious to this Nation.)
But when those works, imperfect, I beheld,
They di^ new c^uses of sad musings yield,
Portending ruin. And, did seem, me thought,
In honor of Deaths trophies to be wroug^t;
Much rather, then from purposes to ^pring
Which aimed at the honor of a King.
For, their unpolisht form, did make them fit
For d^^efull Shows: yea, DEATH on them did sit.
His Captives passed under ev^^y Arch;
Among them, as in Triumph he did march;
Through every Street, upon men's backs were borne
His Conquests. His b^ack Live^ies were wo^ne*
In every House almost. Hi^ spoils were brought
To every Temple. Many Vaults were frau^ht
With his new prizes And his followers grew
To such a multitude, that half our Eugh,
And all our Cypress t^ees, could ha^dly lend him
A branch for every one who did attend him.
My Fancy did present to me that hour
A glimpse of DEATH even in his greatest power.
Me thought I saw him, in a Charret ride,
With all his grim companions by his side.
Such as Oblivion, and Corruption be.
Not half a step before him, ^ode these t^ree,
(On Monsters backed) Pain, Horror, and Despair:
Whose fury, had not Faith, and Hope, and Prayer,
Prevented, through Gods m^rcy none had ever
Escaped Destruction by their best endeavor.
For, next to Death, came Judgment: after whom,
Hell with devou^ing laws, did gaping come,
To swallow all: But, she at One di^ snap,
Who now, for many, has made way to escape.
Death's Carr, with many chains, and ropes, and strings,
And, by a mu^titude of several things,
As Pleasures, Passions, Cares, and such as they,
Was drawn along upon a beaten way,
New gravelled with old bones: and, Sin did seem
To be the foremost Beast of all the Teeme:
And, Sickness to be that which haled next
The Charret wheel; for, none I s^w betwixt.
Time led the way; and, Justice did appea^e,
To sit before, and play the Chariote^r.
For since our Sin to p^ll on Death begun,
The whip of Justice makes the Charret run.
There was of Trumpets, and of Drums the sound;
But in loud cries, and roarings it was drowned.
Sad El^gies, and songs of Lamentation
Were howled out; but, moved no compassion.
Skulls, Coffi^s, Spades, and Mattocks placed were
About the Charret. Crawling Worms were there
And whatsoever else might signify
Deaths nature, and weak man's mortality.
Before the Cha^ret, such a multitude
Of ev'^y Nation in the world I viewed,
That neither could my eye so far perceive,
As they were th^onging; nor my heart conceive
Their countlesse number. For, all those that were
Since Abel died, he drove before him there.
And* of those thousands, dying long ago,
Some here and there, among them, I did know,
Whose Virtues them in death distinguished
(In spite of Death) from others of the dead.
I saw them stand, me thought, as you shall see
High spreading Oaks, which in ^el'd Copses be,
O're-top the shrubs; and, where scarce two are found
Of growth, within ten thousand ro^ of ground.
O^ those who died within the Age before
This year, I sc^rce distinguished a score
From Beasts, and Fowls, and Fishes. For, Death makes
So little difference twixt the flesh he takes,
That, into dust alike he ^urnes it all.
And* if no virtue make distinction shall,
Those men who did of much in lifetime boast,
Shall dying in the common heap be lost.
But, of those Captives which my fantasy
Presented to my apprehensions eye
To grace this Mon^r^es Triump^; most I heeded
Those t^oups, which next before the Carr proceeded,
Even those which in the circuit of this year,
The prey of Death within our Island were:
It was an Army royal, which bec^me
A King, and lo, King JAMES did lead the same.
The Duke of Richmond, and his only brother
The Duke of Lenox, seconded each other.
Next them, in this attendance followed on
That noble Sco^, the Marquis Hammilton,
Sou^hampton, Su^folke, Oxford, Nottingham,
And Holdernesse, their Earledomes leaving, came
To wait upon this Triumph. There I saw
Some reverend Bishops, and some men of Law,
As Winchester, and Hubbard, and I know not
Who else* for to their memories I owe not
So much as here to name them: nor do I
Upon me take to mention punctually
Their order of departing, nor to swear
That all of these fell just within the year.
For of the time if somewhat I do miss,
The matter sure, not much material is.
Some Barons and some Viscounts, saw I too*
Zouch, Bacon, Chichester, and others more,
Whose Titles I forg^t. There fol^ow'd then
Some Officers of note; some Aldermen;
Great store of Knights, and Bu^gesses, with whom
A couple marched, that had the Shcriff^dome
Of London that sad year: the one of which
In Piety and Virtue died so rich,
(If his surviving fame may ^e believed)
That for his loss the City much has grieved.
To be an honor to him, here, therefore
I fix the name of Crisp, which name he bore:
And I am hopeful it shall none offend,
The Muses do this right unto their friend.
Some others also of great state and place,
To me no^ known by office, name, nor face,
Made up the concou^se. But, the common Rabble
To number or distingu^sh, none was able.
For, rich and poor, men, women, old and young,
So fast and so confusedly did throng;
By strokes of Death, so marked, so ghastly wounded,
So thrust together, and so much confounded
Among that glut of people, which from hence
Were sent among them, by the Pestilence,
That possible it was not, to descry
Or who or what they were who passed by.
Yet, now and then, me thought, I had the view
Of some who much resembled those I knew.
And* feign I would the favor have pro^u^ed
To keep their Names from being quite obscured
Among the multitude. But, they were gone
Before the means could well be thought upon.
And pass they must for aye, unknown of me:
For, this was but a waking Dream, I see.
These Fancies* Melancholy often bred:
Yea, many such like Pageants in my head
My working apprehension did beget,
According to those objects which I met.
Some, full of comfort, able to relieve
The heart wh^m dread^ull thoughts did over-grieve.
Some full of horror* such as they have had
(It I mistake nor) that grow desperate mad.
Some, like to their illusions, who in s^ead
Of being humbled in this place of dread*
Are puffed up by their deliverance:
And being full of dangerous a^rogance,
Abuse t^eir souls, with vain imaginations,
Ill-grounded hopes, suggested revelations,
And such like toys, which in their hearts arise
From their own Pride, and Satan's fallacies.
Some, such as these I had; and other some,
Which cannot be by words expressed from
My troubled heart. And, if I had not got
Gods hand, to help untie the^r Gordian-k^ot;
His presence, my bold reas'nings to control;
To curb my passion; to inform my soul;
My faith to strengthen; doubtings to abate;
And so to comfort, and to arbitrate,
That I might see I was of him beloved,
(Though me with many sec^et ^eares he proved)
Su^e, in my self, some Hell I had invented,
Where endless thoughts, and doubts, had me tormented.
But, God those depths has showed me, that I might
See that we carry in our selves to fright
Our selves withal And what a hell of fear
Is in our very souls, till he be there.
Even when I had the b^ight^^sse of the day,
To chase my melancholy thoughts away,
I was to musings troublesome disposed,
As well as when the da^knesse me enclosed;
That, by experiments, which real are,
Those horrors which to others often appear
(And are not demonstrable) might in part
Be felt in me, to mollify my heart;
To stir up hearty thankfuln^sse; and make
My soul, in him the greater pleasure take.
For from those prospects, and those thoughts that g^ieve me,
I, those ext^actions make that much releeve me.
And when my inward combatings a^e past,
It give^h to my joys the sweeter taste.
But leaving th^s, I will again return
To that for which the people soonest mourn.
I looked along the Streets (...) chiefest trade;
And, there, perpetual Holiday they made.
They that one day in sev'n could not forbear
From trading; had not one in half a year.
And, all which some had from their childhood got,
The charges of their flight defrayed not.
To m^ke the greedy Cormorant regard
The Sabbath more, and of ill gains affear'd.
False wa^es, fal^e oaths, false measures, and false weights,
False promises, and ^alsified lights,
Were punished with false hopes, false joys, false fears,
False servants, and false frien^s, to them, and theirs.
The^ who of late their neighbors did contemn,
Had not a neig^bour le^t to comfort them,
When neighborhood was need^ull Such as were
Selfe-love^s, by th^mselves remained here;
And w^nted those contentments, which arise,
From Christian Love, and mutual Amities.
Most Trades were tradefaln, and few Mercha^ts thrived,
Save those men, who by Death and Sickness, lived.
The Sextons, Searchers, they that Corpses ca^ie,
The Herb-wife, Drugg^st, and Apothecarie,
Phy^itians, Surgeons, Nurses, Co^^in-makers,
Bold Mounteb^nckes, and shameless undertakers,
To cure the Pe^t in all; these, rich become:
And what we pray to be delivered from
Was their advantage. Yea, the worst of these
Grew stout, and fat, and proud by this disease.
So^e, vented refuse w^res, at three times more,
Than what is best, was prized at before.
Some set upon their labors such high rates*
As passed Reason: so, they whose estates
(...) fail of reaching to a price so high,
Were feign to perish without remedy.
Some, wolvishly, did prey upon the quick,
Some, theevishly, purloyned from the sick.
Some robbed the dead of sheets, some, of a grave,
That there another guest may lodging have:
Yea, Custom had so hardened most of them,
That they Gods Judgments wholly did contemn.
They, so hard-hearted, and so stupid grew,
So dreadlesly their course they did pursue,
Yea so they flouted, and such jests did make
At that, for which each Christian heart did ache,
That greater were the Plague their mind to have,
Then of the Pestilence to lie and rave.
Now muse I not at what Thucidides
Reports of such wicked men as these,
When Athens was depopulated nigh
By such a Pestilence. Nor wonder I,
That when the Plague did this time sixty year
Oppress the Town of Lions, that some there
Were said to ravish women, even when death
Was drawing from the^ their last gasp o^ breath.
And when infectious B^aines on them they saw,
Which ^ight have kept their lustful flesh in awe.
For man once hardened in impenitence,
Is left unto a reprobated sense.
Till God shall s^nct^fie i^, weal, nor woe,
Can make us fear him as we ought to do.
His love made wanton Is^'^l ^purne at him;
His plagues made Phar'oh, his sharpst rod contemn:
And as the Sun from dunghils, and from sinks,
Produces nothing but rank weeds, and s^inks;
Yet makes a Garden of well-tilled ground,
With wholesome fruits, and fragrant flowers abound:
Or, as in bruising, one thing senteth well,
Another yields a loathsome, stifling smell;
So, Plagues and Blessings, their effect^ declare,
According as their several objects are.
Indeed, my young experience never saw,
So much security, and so much awe
Dwell both together in one place, as here
In this mortality, there did appear.
I am persuaded, time and place was never
In which afflicted men did more endevor
By tears, vows, prayers and true penitence,
To paci^^e Gods wra^h for their offense.
Nor ever was it seen, I think, before,
That men in wickedness^ presumed more.
Here you should meet a man with bleared eyes,
Bewailing our increasing miseries;
Another there* quite reeling drunk* o^ spewing,
And by renewed sins, o^r woes renewing
There sat a piece of sh^melesnesse, whose flaring
Attires and looks, did show a monstrou^ daring:
For, in the postures of true impu^ence,
She seemed as if she woo^d the Pestilence
Yonn talked a couple, ma^ter worth your hearing:
Hard by, were others, telling lies, or sw^aring.
Some st^eets had Ch^rches full of people, weeping:
Some others, Tavernes had, rude-revell keepin^:
Within some houses Psalms and Hymns were sung:
With raylings, and loud scouldings, others rung.
More C^arity, did never, yet, appear:
Nor more maliciousness, then we had here.
True piety was ominentl^ known;
H^po^risie as evidently shown.
More avarice, more gapers for the wealth
O^ such as died; no former times of health
Afforded us; nor men of larger heart,
things need^ull for their brethren, to impart.
Their masters goods, some servants lewdly spent,
In nightly feastings, foolish merriment,
And lewd uncleanness. Other some again,
Did such an honest carfulness ^etaine,
That their endeavo^s had a good success,
And, Man, and Master m^t with joyfulnesse.
Yea, Good and Evil, penitence and sin
Did here so d^ive each other out and in;
That in observing it, I saw, me thought,
In sight of Heaven, a d^ead^ull Comb^t fought
Concerning this whole Island, which yet lies,
To be Gods purchas^, or the Devil^ prise.
Vice wounded V^rtue; Virtue o't co^peld
The strongest Vices to forsake the field.
Distrust raised up a storm, to drive ^way
Sure-helpe, our ship, which at Hopes anchor la^;
And brought supplies with every wind and tide,
Whereby this Land was fed and fo^tifi^d.
The Fort of Faith, was played on by D^spai^e:
But then the gunshot o^ continuall-Pray'r
(Well aimed ^t Heaven) Devotion so did ply,
That, he dismounts the Foes Artillery.
The Spirit and the Flesh together strive,
And, often each other into peril drive.
Presumption, huge high Scaling ladders, r^ared,
And then the taking of our Fort was feared.
But awful Reverence did him oppo^^,
And with Humilities de^pe Trench enclose
The Platform of that Fortress, from whose Towers
We fight with Principalities, and Powers.
Suggestion lay pur due by Contemplation,
And sought to disadvantage M^ditation.
The Regiment of Prudence was assailed,
By headstrong Ignorance, who much prevailed
Where Temperance was quartered, there I saw
Excess and Riot, both together draw
Their troops against her: and, I some espied
To yield, and overcome on either side*
The place that v^liant Fortitude made good,
Faint-heartednesse (though out of sight he stood)
Did cowardly oppose, and courses take,
Which otherwhile his Constancy did shake.
For Carnal policy her Engineer,
Had closely suncke a Mine which had gone near
To blow all up. But Providence divine
Did soon prevent it by a Counter-mine.
Yet Morall-Iustice (though a Court o^ Gu^rd
Was placed, and often r^leeved in her Ward)
Had much ado to m^ke a strong defense
Against her Foes. For, Fraud, and Violence,
Respect of persons, Fear, Hate, Perjury,
Faire-speaking, and corrupting Brib^ry,
Did wound her much; though she did often take
Avengement; and o^ some, examples make.
Some Vices, there, I saw themselves disguise
Like Virtues, that their Foes they might surprise;
As do the Dunkirks, when aboard to lay
Our ships, an English flag they do display.
Pride went for Come^^nesse: profuse Excess,
For Hospitality: base Drunkenness
Was called Good fello^ship: blunt Rashness came
Attyr'd li^e Valor: Sloth had got the name
Of Quietness: accursed Avarice,
Was termed Good husbandry. Mere Cowardice
Appeared like prudent Wariness, and might
Have passed for a very valiant wight.
Yea, every Vice, to gain his purpose, had
So^e ma^kes o^ vertue-like disguise^ made*
And, many times, such hellish plo^s were laid,
That diverse moral Virtues were gainsaid,
Defamed, pursued, and wounded by their own;
Whose glory had no^ else been overthrown.
^ust-de^ling has been took for Cruelty:
Pure-love for Lust: upright Integri^y
For cunning Falsh^od: yea, divinest Graces
Have been at variance brought in diverse Cases,
(By wicked Stratagems) that vain Inventions,
Might frustrate pious works, and good intentions.
To furthe^ stri^e, great Quarrels broached are,
Twixt Faith and Works. There is another j^r
Begun erewhile, betwixt no worse a pai^e,
Then Preachin^, and her blessed Sister Prayer.
God grant they may agree; for, I ^e're knew
A quiet Church, but where they kept one Pew.
Faith and Repentance also are, of late,
About their Birth-rig^t fallen at d^bate.
But by the Church-bookes it appears to me
Their Bir^hs and their Conceptions mentioned be
Without such nice regard to their precedings,
As some have urged in their needless pleadings.
And, so it pleased the Father, Son and Spirit:
Because that Law by which they shall inherit
The promised meed; does never question move,
How soon or late, but how sincere they prove.
Moreover, in this ^attell I espied
Some Ambodexters, fight on either side.
The Moralist, who all Religion wants;
Church-Papists; Time-observing Protestants.
All Double-dealers* Hypocrites, and such
Base Neutrals, who have scandalized much,
And much endangered those who do contend
This ^le, from desolation, to defend.
Beside these former Combatants, which fought
Against or for us; I perceived, me thought,
Both good and evil Angels fi^hting too,
The one, to help; the other, ha^me to do.
And though thi^ battle yet appears not
To common view, so cru^ll nor so hot
As I conceive it: yet it will appear
To all in time, with comfort, or with fear.
For, s^ill, and every day, those enemies
Stand a^m'd and watc^ing opportunities
To seiz^ us; and will seize us, if th^s^ times
Shall make complete the measure of our Crimes;
Or our continuing ^ollies drive away
Our Ange^l G^ard, which does our ^all delay.
Oh st^y them Lord! and make that side the stronger,
For whom this Lan^ shall yet be sp^^ed longer.
And let us, my dea^e C^untrimen, with speed,
Of that which so conce^neth us, take h^^d.
Obse^ve, thou famoust City of this L^nd,
How h^avily on thee God lays his hand.
The very rumor of this Plague did make
The fa^th^st dwellers of this I Will to shak^:
And such a sent of Death they seemed to c^ry,
Who in o^ nea^e about thy Climat^ tarry,
That, from the Mount to Ba^w^ck they were hated,
Or shunned, as persons excommunicated.
and three weeks ayring on old Sarum plain,
Would ^^arce a lodging for a brother gain.
Yea, mark, ma^k London, and confess with me,
That God ^at^ justly thus afflicted thee,
And that in every point this Plague has bin
According to the nature of thy sin.
In thy prosperity, such was thy pride,
That thou the Countries plainn^sse did deride.
Thy wanton Children would often straggle out,
At honest husban^men to jeere and flou^.
Their homely garments, did offend thine eyes:
They did their rural Dia^ect^ despise*
Their games and merriments (which for them, be
As commendable, as are thine for thee)
Thou laughedst at: their gestures, and their fashions,
Their very diet, an^ their habitations
Were sported at: yea, those ungrateful Things,
Did scoff them for their hearty Welcomings;
And taught even those that had been country-born
The wholesome places of their birth to scorn.
And, see, now see, those thanklesse ones are feign
To seek their fathers thatched Roofes again;
And, ask those good old women blessing, whom
They did not see, since they did rich become;
And never would have seen, perhaps, unless
This Plague had whipped their ingratefulnesse.
Yea, thine own natural Children have been glad
To scrape acquaintance where no friends they had;
To praise a homely, and a sm^ky Shed;
A dark low Parlour, an unea^^e Bed;
An ill dressed di^t; yea, perchance, commend
A chu^lish Landlord, for an honest Friend;
Yet be contented both to pray and pay,
That they may leave obtain with him to stay.
And peradventure, some of those who played
The scoffers hereto^ore, were fully pai^.
Th^n, Citizens were sha^k^, and preyed upon,
In recompense of wrong^ before time done
To silly Countrim^n; and were defeated
Of ^ha^, whereof, some Rusticks, they had cheated.
Moreover, for the Countries imitations
Of thy fantastic, vain, and fruitless fashions,
(Of thy apparel, and of thy excess^
In Feasts, in Games, in Lust, in Idleness;
With such abominations) some of those
Who came from thee, shall doubtlesly dispose
To every Shire a Vial of that wrath,
Which thy transgression long deserved has:
That, thou and they, who sinners were together,
May Rods be made to punish one another;
And give each other bitterness^ to sup,
As you have jointly quaft of Pleasures Cup.
As to and fro I walked, that I might
On every ruthful Object fix my sight,
Upon those Golgatha's I cast mine eye,
Where all the comm^n people buried lie.
Lie buried did I say? I should have said,
Where C^rkasses to bury Graves were laid.
Lord! what a sight was there? and what strong smells
Ascended from among Death's loathsome Cells?
You scarce could make a little Infants bed
In all those Plots, but you should pare a head,
An arm, a shoulder, or a leg away,
O^ one or other who there buried lay.
One grave did often many scores enclose
Of men and women: and, it may be those
That could not in two Parishes agree,
Now in one little room at quiet be.
Yonn lay a heap of skulls; another there;
Here, half unburied did a Corpse appear.
Close by, you might have seen a brace of feet
That had kicked off the rotten winding sheet.
A little further saw we othersome,
Thrust out their arms for want of elbow room.
A lock of woman's hair; a dead man's face
Vncover'd; and a ghastly sight it was.
Oh! here, here v^ew'd I what the gl^ries be
Of pampered flesh: here plainly did I see
How grim those ^eauties will e're long appear,
Which we so dote on, and so cove^, here.
Here was enough to cool the hottest flame
Of lawless lust. Here, was enough to tame
The ma^st ambition. And, all they that go
Vnbetter'd from such objects; worse do grow.
From hence (for here was no abiding long)
Our Allies and our Lanes, I walked among,
Where those Artificers their dwel^ings had,
By whom our idle Traders rich are made.
The Plague raved there indeed. For, who were they
Whom that Contagion fastest swept away
But those whose d^ily lab'^ing hands did feed
Their honest Families? and greatly steed
This place by their mechanic industries?
These are the swarms of Bees, w^ose painful thighs
Bring Wax unto this Hive; and from whose bones
The Honey drops, that feeds many Drones.
These are the Bulwarks of this ^enselesse Town,
And when this Wall of Bones is overthrown,
Our stately Dwellings, now both fair and tall,
Will quickly, of themselves, to ruin fall.
Of these, and of t^eir households, dai^y died
Twice more then did of all sorts else beside;
And hungry Poverty (without reliefes)
Did much inrag^ and multipliply their griefs.
The Rich could fly; or, if they staid, they had
Such means that their disease the less was made*
Yea, those poor aged folks that make a show
Of greatest need, did boldly come and go,
To ask men's Alms* or what their Parish granted;
An^ nothing at this time those people wanted,
But thankfulness* less malice to ea^h other;
And grace to live more quietly together.
Their bodies, d^y'd with age, were seldom struck
By this Disease* Their neighbors notic^ took
Of all their wants. Among them, were not many
That had ^ull fam^lies. Or if that any
Of these had children sick; some good supplies
Were sent them from the general Charities.
Moreover, common Beggars are a nation
Not always keeping in one habitation.
They can remove as time occasion brings:
They have their progresses as well as King;
And most of these, when hence the rich did go,
Removed themselves into the Country too.
The rest about our streets did ask their bread,
And never in their lives, were fuller fed.
But, those good people mentioned before,
Who, till their work did fail them, fed the poor
As well as others; and maintained had
Great families, by ^ome laborious trade:
Ev'^ those di^ suffer most. For, neither having
Provision left them, nor the face o^ craving;
Nor means of labor: First, to pawn they sent
Their brass and pewter: t^en, their bedding went.
Their garments next* or stuff of best esteem:
At length, even that which should the rest redeem,
Their working Instruments. When that was gone,
Their Lease was pawned, if it might be done.
And peradventure, at the last of all,
These things were sold outright for sums but small*
Or else quite forfeited. For, here were they
Who made of these poor souls, a gainful prey.
And as one Plague had on the li^e a power,
So did these other Plagues, their goods devour.
When all was gone, afflicted they became
With secret griefs, with poverty, and shame.
And, wanting cheerful minds, and due refection,
Were seized on, the soone^, by Infection:
For, hearts half broke, and households fa^^isht near*
Are quickly spent, when visited they are.
The careful Master, though it would have saved
A servants life, to get him what he craved,
No kind of Medicine able was to give him;
Nay scarce with bread and water to relieve him*
The tender hearted Mother, has for meat
Often heard her dearest child, in vain, entreat;
And had or four or five on point of dying
At once, for drink to ease their torment, crying.
The loving husband sitting by her side,
To save whose life he gladly would have died,
Unable was out of his whole estate,
To purchase her a dram of Mithridate;
One mess of Cordial broth, or such like thing,
Although it might prevent her perishing.
Sometime, at such a need, abroad they came,
To ask for help; but, then, the fear of shame,
Of scorn, or of deni^ll, them withheld
To put in practice, what their want compelled.
Upon an Evening (when the wa^ning light
Was that which could be called nor day nor night)
I met with one of these, who on me cast
A ^ut^full eye: and a^ he by me past,
Me thought, I heard him, softly, somewhat say,
As if that he for some relief did pray:
Whereat (he seeming in good cloth^s to be)
I staid, and asked him, if he spoke to me.
He bashfully replied; that, indeed
He was ashamed to speak aloud, what Need
Did make him softly mutter* Somewhat more
He would have spoken, but his tongu^ forbore
To tell the re^t; because his eyes did see
Their tears had (almost) drawn fo^th tears from me,
And that my hand was ready to bestow
That help which my poor fortunes could allow*
Nor his, nor all men's tongues, could mo^e relate,
Then I my self conceived of hi^ estate.
Me thou^ht, I saw, as if I had been there,
What w^nts in his, and such men's houses were;
How empty, and how naked it became*
How nasty, Poverty h^d made the same*
Me thou^ht I saw, how sick^ his wife mightlye;
Me thought I heard his half sta^v'd children cry;
Me thou^^t I felt, with what a broken heart
He looked upon t^em, e're he could depart
To try, i^ (by Gods ^avour) he could meet
With any means of comfort in the street.
And, Lord my God, thou know, that, when alone
The griefs of such as these, I mused on;
My pity I with watery eye^ have shown,
And more bewailed their sorrows, then my own*
But, since those Dewes are vain that ^ruitlesse be;
And since the share that is allotted me*
Of this worlds heritage, will not ^uffice
To bring relie^e to these men's miseries;
Oh! let my tears (ye ri^h men) make your ground
With fruits of Charity the more abound.
Let me entreat you, tha^, when God shall bring
Upon this place, another Visiting,
You would remember, some relief to send
To those, who on t^eir labors do depend,
And have not got their impudence of ^ace,
Who idly beg their bread from place to place.
God, you the S^ewards of his g^ods does make,
And how you use them, he account will take.
It will not be enough, that you have paid
The public taxes on your houses laid;
Or that* you, now and then, do send a sum
To be disposed, to you know not whom:
But, you your selves, must, by your selves alone,
Those neighbour^, o^ acqu^intance think upon,
Who likeliest are in such a time of need,
To want of that, whe^ein you do exceed:
And, if you know of none, enquire them out;
Or leave some honest neigbour thereabout,
To be your Alm'ner (when the Town you leave)
That, yo^, and they, a Blessing may receive*
For, if that every weal^hy man would find
But one, or two, to cherish in this kind:
Gods wrat^ would much the better be appeased,
And we should of our plagues be sooner eased
As I request the Richer men to take
This pious course; A suit, I likewise m^ke
That our inferior Tradesmen, would not so
Abuse their times of profit, as they do.
For, most of those do live at rates as high,
As all their gains (at utmost) will supply.
Yea, many times they mount above the tops
Of present fortunes, and ensuing hopes:
That, if a sickness, or unlooked for Cross,
Or want of trade, or any slender loss,
But for a Year, a Qu^rter, or a Term,
Befalls them: it soon makes so infirm
Their over-strain'd Estates; that Alms are neede^,
Ere any failin^s are by others heeded.
Of these, and other things I notions gained,
Whilst in our sickly City I remained;
And much I contemplated what I saw,
Some profitable uses thence to draw.
But, feeling that my thought^ nigh (...) were,
With over-musing on those objects there:
I thought to walk abroad into the ^^eld,
To take those comforts, which f^esh air does yield;
And, to revive my heart, which heavy grew,
With what the streets did offer to my view;
But little ease I found; for, there mine eye^
Discovered Sorrow in a new disguise:
And in so many shapes, himself he showed,
That, still my passion was afresh renewed.
Her^, dead upon the Road, a man did lie,
That was (an hour before) as well, as (...)*
There, sat another, who did thither come
In health, but had not strength to bear him home.
Yonn, spraul'd a third, so sick, he did not know
From whence he came, nor whither he should go.
A little further off, a fourth did creep
Into a ditch, and there his Obit keep.
Abo^t the Fields ran one, who being fled
(In spite of his attendance) from his bed,
Looked like a Lunatique from Bedlem broken;
And, though of health he had no hopeful token;
Yet, that he ailed ought, he would not yield,
Till Death had, stru^ him dead upon the field.
This way, a Str^nger by hi^ Host expel^ed,
That way, a Servant (shut from where he dwelled)
Came weakly stagg'ring fo^th, and (crushed beneath
Diseases, and unkindnes^e) sought for Death;
Which soon was f^^nd and glad was he, they say,
Who for his Death-^ed gained a Cock of Hay
At this cross pa^h, were Bearers fetching home
A Neighbor, who in health did thither come:
Close by, were others digging up the ground,
To hide a stranger whom they dead had found.
Before me, went with Corpses, many a one;
Behind, as many mo did ^ollow on,
With runnin^ sores, one begged at yonder gate:
At next Lanes end, another Lazar sat.
Some halted, as if wounded in the wars;
Some held their necks awry, some showed their scars*
Some, met I weeping, for the loss of friends;
Some others, for their swift approaching ends;
And every thing with sorrow was affected,
On whatsoever it was mine eye reflected.
The Prospect, which was wont to greet mine eye
With shows of pleasure in variety,
(And looked, as if it cheerfully did smile,
Upon the bordring Villages, ere while.)
Had no such pleasingnesse as heretofore,
For every place, a mask of sorrow wore.
The walks are unfrequented, and the path
Late trodden bare, a grassie Carpet has.
I could not see (of all t^ose Gallants) one
That visited Hide-par^e, and Mary-borne.
None w^ndred through the pastures, up and down*
But, as about some pe^ty Country town:
Nor could I view in many Summers days,
One man of note to ride upon our ways.
Lord, what a d^ff^rence did^t thou put between
That Summer, and the rest that I have seen!
How did thou change our Fi^lds! and what a face
Of Sadness, did thou set upon each place!
Yet oh! how few remember it, or feel
The touches of it, on their hearts of s^eele!
And when our banished ^^i^h thou did renew,
Who did return to thee the praises due?
What others apprehended, they know best;
But if it could be fully here exp^e^^
What of that alteration I conceived*
When of their pleasures, God our fields bereaved;
It would much mo^e be minded: For they had
Naught in them, but what moved to be sad.
Not many weeks, before, it was not so.
But, ^leasures, had their passage to and fro.
Which way so^ver from our Gates I went,
I lately did behold with much content,
The fields bestrow'd with people all about:
Some paceing homeward, and some passing out.
Some, by the bancks of ^hame their pleasure taking;
Some, Sulli-bibs, among the Milk-maids, making;
With music, some upon the waters, rowing;
Some, to the next adjoining Hamlets going;
And Hogsdone, Islington, and Tethnam-Court,
For Cakes and Cream* had then no small resort.
Some, sat and wooed their Love^s in the shadows;
Some, straggled to and fro athwart the meadows;
Some, in discourse, their hours, away did pass;
Some, played the toyish w^ntons on the grass;
Some, of Religion; some of business talked;
Some coached were* some horsed; and some walked.
Here Citizens; there Students, many a one;
Here ^wo together; and, yonn one alone.
Of Nymphs and Ladies. I have often eyed
A thousand walking at one Evening tide;
As many Gentleman: and young and old
Of meaner sort, as many* ten times told.
And, when I did from some high Tower survey
The Rod^s, and Paths, which round below me lay,
Obser^ing how each passage thronged was
W^^h men and Cattle, which both ways did pass;
How many petty path^, both far and near,
With rows of people sti^l suppl^ed were;
What infinite provision still came in,
And what abundance has exported bin;
Me thought this populous City and the trade
Which we from every Coast about her had,
Was well resembled by an A^t-h^ll, which
(In some old Forest) is made lar^e, and ^ich
By those laborious creatures, who have thither
Brought all their wealth, and Coloni^s together.
For, as their peopled Borrough ha^h resort
From every quarter, by a several Port,
And from each Gate thereof a great Rode has
That branches into many a little Path;
And, as those Negroes do not only fill
Each great and lesser t^act unto their hill,
But, also, spread themselves out of those ways,
Among the grass, the leaves, and bushy sprayes:
Even s^, ^he people here, did come and go
Through our large Rodes; disperse themselves into
A thousand passages; and, often stray
Over neighboring Pastures, in a pathlesse way.
This, formerly I saw; and, on that Station,
Where this I marked; I had this Contemplation.
How happy were this People, did they know
What rest, our God upon them did bestow!
On us, what show^es of blessings has he rained,
Which he from other Cities has restrained?
And, from how many mischiefs has be freed us*
Which ^all on those that in good works exceed us*
Here lurk no ravenous Beasts to make a prey
On those fat C^ttell which these Fields o're-lay.
Within our Gro^es no cruel Out-lawes hide,
That in the blood of passengers are died.
Our Lambs, unworry'd, lie abroad, benighted;
By day, our Virgins walk the Fields unfrighted.
No neighboring Country does our food forestall;
No Convoyes need to come and g^e withal;
No foreign Prince can sudd^^ly appall us,
For Seas do mote us, and huge Rocks do wall us.
No rotten Fennes do make our air unsound;
No Foe, does with a trench enclose us round.
We neither tumults have by night or d^y,
Nor rude unruly Garrisons in pay.
No Taxes, yet, our Land does over-load:
Our Children are not pressed for wars abroad.
From Spanish Inquisitions we ar^ free;
(God grant that we, for ever, so may be)
We are compeld to no Idolatries;
Our people do not in rebellions rise:
No sactious spirits much disturb the State;
No Plagues, our dwellings, yet, dep^pulate.
No Rots or Murraines have our Cattle killed:
Our Barnes and Store-house^, with fruits are filled:
On ev'r^ thr^sh^ld, store o^ children play;
Our breeding Cattle fill both street and way.
And, were we thankful unto him that gave them,
There are no blessings, but we here might have them.
See, how like Bees upon a Summer-Eve,
(When their young Nymphs have ove^-fill'd the hive)
They swarm about the City, sporting so,
As if a winter gale would never blow.
How little d^e they dream, how many times,
While ^hey deserved ruin for their Crimes,
God, naitheless^, has showed mercies on them,
And s^opt those Plagues that coming were upon them!
How seldom is it thought, the power of him,
those love they much forg^t (if not contemn)
Might heap upon t^em all t^ose fea^full things,
Which he upon our neig^bouring Nations brings.
For, in a moment, he could s^mmon hither
His Judgments, and inflict them, all together.
Even all. B^t, one of those which he has brought
On other Cities, would enough be thought.
If in displeas^re ^e should call from thence
Where now it r^ves, the slaugh^ring Pest^lence,
Or else the Famine* what a change ^ere that,
To them that are so healthy, and so fat?
How desolate, in less t^en half a year,
Might all our lodgin^s and o^r streets appear?
How unfrequented would that randevow
Be m^de, in which, we throng, and just ^e now?
How lonely would these walk^s and fi^lds be found,
Wherein I s^e the people s^ abound?
Or, should ^e w^istle for his armed Bands,
(Which now are wasting ^ther Christian Lands)
To put in action on our Commick Stage
The Tragedies of War, and bru^^sh rage:
What lamentations then here would be made,
And calling unto mind, what peace we had?
Should we in every house* at board and bed
Have So^ldiers and rude Captains bille^ed,
That would command, and swagger as if they
Had all the Towneship (where they lodge) in pay,
To w^it upon their pleas^res; and should see
Our own defenders, our devourers be.
Should we behold these Fields (now full of sport)
Cut out with T^enches; there, a warlike Fort;
Another here; A Sconce not far from that;
A new raised Mount, or some fire-spitting Cat,
From which the Foes our actions might survey,
And ma^e their B^llets on our houses play.
Should we behold our Dwellings beaten down;
Our Temples battered; Turrets over thrown;
Our seats of pleasure b^rning from afar;
Hear, from without, the thundering voice of War*
Within, the shriekes of children, or the cry
Of women, struck with fears, or famisht nigh.
Should we behold, what painfully we got,
Possessed by those that seek to cut our thr^at;
Our children slain before us, on the ground;
Our selves pierced through with some deep mortal wound;
And see (^v'n there) where we have wantonniz'd,
Our beau^eous wives, by some stern Troup surpised,
And ravished in our view. Or (which is worse)
When we have seen all this, be forced perforce
To live; and live their slaves that shall possess
Our wives, and all our ou^ward happiness;
And, then, want also, that pure Word of Grace
To comfort us, which yet adornes this place.
Should such a Destiny (as God d^fend)
This people, and this place, thought I, attend.
(For, this may be; and every day we hear
That other Nations do this burden b^are)
Should we who now for pleasure walk the field,
Be saine to search what weeds the pastures yield
To feed us; and peake hungerly about,
Some Roots, or Hawes, or Berries to find out,
To keep from starving; and not gain a food
So mean, without the hazard of our blood:
Should some contagious sickness, nois^me make
This place, wherein, such pleas^re now we take:
Should in these places, whither we repair
Our bodies to refresh with wholesome air,
Those blastings or Serenes upon us fall,
Which other places are anoy'd withal.
Should from the wife the husband be divorced,
Or from the parent should the child be forced,
While here they walk^, and perish by the sword:
Or, should here be a famine of the Word,
On which would follow, to our grief and shame,
A thousand other Plagues which I could name.
Should th^se things be; then what our blessings are
It would by such a curse too soon appear.
Then, fe^le we should, what comforts might arise
From those great mercie^, which we now despise,
Or think not on. Yea, so we might enjoy
But part of that which now we mis-employ,
We think it would, a greater happiness,
Then, yet we find in all we now possess.
We then should know how much we have b^ene blessed
In our long time of plenty* health, and rest:
How sweet it is that we may to and fro
Without restraint, or fear, or danger go;
How much we owe to him that has so long
Our Granards filled, and our Gates made strong;
Permitting us to walk for our delight
About our fields, whilst others march to fight;
And s^ffring us to least, whilst others fast,
Or, of the bread of sour Affliction taste.
As heretofore the peopled Fields I walked,
To this effect, my thoughts within me talked;
And though all present Objects gave cont^nt,
My heart did such Ideaes represent
Of Judgments likely to be cast upon
So great a City, and a sinful one;
That much I feared, I should live to see,
Some such afflictions, as here mentioned be.
And lo, (though yet, I hope, not in his wrath)
God, part of that I feared, inflicted has:
A warning War he has begun to wage
Against the crying sins of this our age,
And of this place: And in a gentle wise
Poured out a taste of those Calamities
Which other feel at large: that, we should mourn^
For our transgressions, and to him retu^ne.
Vouchsafe, oh! God, that soon return we may,
Lest thou, in anger, sweep us all away.
If we observed, well, what God has done,
And in what manner, he with us begun;
How he forewarned us of those Plagues, which he
Vouchsafed David should a chus^r be:
(And how, even he himself, in mercy chused,
To keep us from what David had refused)
We should perceive, that our most loving God
At first did threaten, with a Fathers rod.
A little while before this Pestilence,
Of his just wrath we had in^elligence
By diverse tokens* which we did contemn,
O^, at the best, but little heeded them.
The Spring before this Plague, one jerke we had
By WAR, which made no little number sad,
By calling many from their ease; by taking
Some husbands from their wives, and childless making
Some Parents: which permitted was to show us
In part, what sha^pe corrections God did owe us.
And make us mind, that this unhallowed place
Is thus long spared merely of his grace.
Else, to awake us with some touch of that
Which he has brought on many a foreign State.
For, that he might but touch us, he did call
No Armies hither, to affl^ct us all.
But, as a General in time of war,
When all his Troops of somewhat guilty are;
On them the fo^tune of the lot does try,
That some as warnings to the rest may dye:
Even so, the God of Armies, in like case,
Picked, here and there a man, from every place,
To meet the sword: that, every place might learn,
His Mercies, and his Justice to discern,
And, leave off sin; which, if we break not from,
His Plague^, and terrors all, w^ll shortly come.
If any shall object, we lost in these
But some corrupted blood, which did disease
The common Body: Let them under^tand,
That it portends hot Fevers in the Land,
When suc^ Phl^botomy is needful thought:
And, that, good blood, as well as what is naught,
Is lost at every op^ni^g of a vein.
The foot was pricked, and we did feel no pain;
The next blood letting may be in the Arm,
Where lies our s^rength* God shend us from the harm
Of such like Surgery; unless we see
The Sign be better then it seems to be.
God scared us, lately, also, by a Dearth,
And for the peoples faults did curse the Earth.
The Winter last before the Pes^ began,
Throughout some No^^herne Shires a Famine ran,
That starved some; and other some were feign,
Their hungry appetites to entertain
With swine, and sheep, and horses, which have died
By chance: For, better could they not provide.
Some others on boild nettles gladly fed,
Or else had often gone supperlesse to bed.
And this was much, considering the soil
And o^dinary plenties of this I Will.
Nay, since the Si^knesse, we small hope^ p^ssessed,
Of that, wherewith, this Ki^g^om, God has blessed.
For, when Earths womb did big with plenty grow,
When her large bosom, and full breasts, did show
Such signe^ of fair increase, that hope of more
Was never in our life-times, heretofore:
A later frost, our early blossoms cropped;
The heavens, upon our labour^, leanness dropped;
An^ such perpetu^ll showers, and floods we had,
That o^ a Famine, we were fearful made,
And scarce had any hope (in common reason)
Of harvest either in, or out of season.
Yet, he wi^h-held that Plague. The Sky grew clear;
A kindly weather drove away our f^are;
The Floods did sinck; the Mildewes were expelled;
The bending ears of ^orne, their heads up held;
And Harvest came, which filled our Granards more,
Then in the fruitfull'st, of sev'n years before.
And, doubtless* had we gone to meet our God,
Wi^^ true repentance, when this fearful Rod
Was raised first; it had away be^ne flung,
And not continued in this Realm so long.
For, as a Father, when his dearest chil^
Grows disobedient, rude, and over-wilde,
first warnes; th^n threatens; then, the rod does show;
T^en frowns; and then does fear him with a blow.
Th^^ doubles, and redoubles it, until
He makes him grow more plyant to his will,
And leave those wanton tricks, which in conclusion
May prove the p^rents g^iefe, and childs confusion.
Even as this Father; so, our God h^th wrought.
Us, by his Word of Grace, he first besought:
T^en* of his Wrath, and Justice spoke unto us:
Next, hanging over u^, he plagues did show us.
Yea, diverse months before this Vengeance came,
The spotted Fever did forewarne the same.
Was made her Harbenger; and in one week
Sent hu^dreds, in the Grave, their bed to seek.
Which naught prevailing, he did thereupon
(As being loath to strike) first strike but one.
Then, two or three: then slaid a while; and than
To smi^e another number he began,
And then a greater. Neither did God show
This mercy, only, in the public blow;
But daign'd it, also, in that chastisement,
Which he to every man in private sent.
To hasten his repent^nce; first, he smote
Some one of those he knew, in place remote;
Within a w^eke, another better known;
Next week a friend; the next a dearer-one;
A little after that, perhaps, another;
And then a kinsman, or ^n only brother.
Which no a^endm^nt working, God did come
(To make him heedfull) somewhat nearer home:
Knocked at h^s neighbors house, and took out all
Or most, who lodged on the other side the wall:
Then called at his door, and seized on
A servant first; soon afterward, a son;
Next night wa^ hazarded a daughters life;
And e're that morning come, he lost his wife:
At last fell sick himself, and then repented,
Or died, or lives to be worse tormented.
Thus, as it were by steps, God came upon us,
That either Love or Terror might have won us,
To seek our peace. But, yet, so ^ew were warned,
(And this long suffering, so few souls discerned)
That some the nature of this Plague beli'd;
The number of the dead, some strove to hide.
On groundles hopes, ^ods Iudgme^^s, some deferred.
Some scofted others, when they were deterred.
Some raised a profit from it. Yea, so few
Conceived what was likely to ensue;
That, when we should like Niniveh have fared,
For sports, and causeless Triumphs we prepared*
Of pleasure, in ^xcessive wise, we ^asted.
We feasted, when we rather should have f^sted.
And when in sackcloth we should loud have cried,
Even then, we ruffled in our greatest pride.
Which God ^^rceiving, and that we were grown
Regardlesse of his smiles, and of his frown;
He did comm^n^ his Mercy, to let go
That hand, which did restrain his Justice so.
Then, catching up a Vial of his wrath,
(Which he in store for such offenders has)
He did on thi^ our City, pour it down.
And, as strong poison shed upon the crown,
Descends to the members, from the head;
And, soon, does over all the body spread:
Even so, this noisome plague of Pestilence,
On our head City Falling, did from thence,
Disperse, and soake throughout this Emp^ry,
In spite of all our carnal polici^.
Our want of penitency, to allay
Gods wrath, and stop his anger in the way,
Enflamed and exasperated so
This F^end, that he did thousands overthrow
In ^ome few minutes: and* the greedy Grave
Devou'd, as if it none alive would save.
Death lurkt at every angle of the s^eet,
And did a^rest whom ever he did meet.
There scarcely was that house or lodging found,
In which he did not either slay or wound.
In every room his murders acted he,
Our Close^s nay our Temples were not free
From his attemptings; no not while men prayed,
Could his unb^idled fury be delayed.
In sundry Families the^e was not one
Whom his rude hand did take compassion on:
Nay many times he did not spare the last,
Until the burial of the first was past.
For, e're the Bearers back again could come,
The rest were r^ady ^or their graves at home.
Nor bad nor good, nor rich nor poor did escape him,
Nor fool nor w^seman, an excuse could shape him:
He shunned not the yo^g man in the sadle,
Nor him that lay and cried in the cradle.
So dreadful was his look, so stern and grim,
That many died through very fear of him.
For, to men's fancies he did often ap^ea^e
In shapes which so exceedi^d ghastly were,
That flesh and blood, unable was, to brook,
The horror of his all a^^righting look.
Even in that house, whose roof did cover me,
Of this, a sad ^xperiment had we:
For, there, a plague-sick^ man (at least) conceived
That Death a shape assuming, he perceived
Deformed and ugly; where at lou^ he cries,
Oh! hi^e me, hide me, from his dreadful ey^s.
Look, oh! look there he comes: now by the ^ed
He stands; now at the f^^t; now at the head.
Oh! draw, draw, draw the Curtain, Si^s I pray,
That his grim loo^e no more b^hold I may.
To this ^ffect, and such like wo^ds he spoke,
But that their hea^ers hearts they more did sh^^e.
Then, rested he a while, and by and by
Up starting, with a lamentable cry,
Ran to a Couch, whereon his wife (w^o waking
Two nights before had been) some ^est was taking;
There, kneeling down, and both his hands up rearing,
As if his eye had seen pale Death appearing
To st^ike his wife; Good Sir, said he, forbear
To kill or h^m^ that poor young woman there:
For God's sake do not strike her; for you s^e
She Is great with child. Lo, you have wounded me
In twenty places; and I do not c^re
How me you mischi^fe, so that her you spare.
Even this, and more then I to mind can call,
He acted with a look so tragic^ll,
Tha^, all by standers* might have ^hou^ht* his eyes
Saw real objects, and no fantasies.
To others, Death, no doubt, himself convaid
In other forms; and other Pageants played.
Whilst in her arms the mother thought she kept
Her Infant saf^; Death stole him when she slept.
Sometime he took the mothers life away,
And left the little babe, to lie and play
With her cold paps, and childish game to make
About those eyes, that never mo^e shall wake.
Som^times when friends were talking, he did force
The one to leave unfinisht his discourse.
Sometimes, their morning meetings he has thwarted,
Who thought not they for ever had been parted,
The night before. And, many a lovely Bride,
He has defloured by the Bridegroomes side.
At every hand, lay one or other dying;
On every part, were men and women crying,
One for a husband; for a friend another;
One for a sister, wife, or only brother:
Some children for their parents moan were making*
Some, for the loss of servants care were taking;
Some parents for a child; and some again
^or loss of all their children did complain.
The mother dared not to close her eyes,
Through fear that while she sleeps, her baby dies.
Wives trusted not t^eir husbands out of door,
Lest they might back again return no more.
And in their absence if they did but hear
One knock or call in have, they quaked through fear,
That some unluckly messenger had brought
The news of those mis^hances they forethought.
And if (with care and grief o're-tyr'd) they slept,
They dreamed of Ghosts, and Graves, and sh^iekt, and wept.
He that over night went healthy to his b^d,
Looked* e're the morning, to be sick, or dead.
He that rose Iusty, at the rising Sun,
Grew faint, and breathless, e're the day was done
And, he that for his friend, this day did sorrow,
Lay close besid^ him in a grave the morrow.
Some men amidst their pleasures were diseased*
Some, in the very act of sin were seized:
Some, hence were taken laughing, and some singing:
Some, as they others to their graves were bringing,
Yea, so impartial was this kind of Death,
And so extremely venomous his breath,
That they who did not in this place expire,
Where saved, like the Children in the fire*
It may be that to some it will appear,
My Muse has only poetized here;
And that I fa^n'd expressions do rehearse,
As most of those that use to wri^e in verse:
But, in this Poem I pursue the story
Of real Truth, without an Allegory:
And many yet surviving witness may,
That I come short of what I more might say.
But, what I can I utter; and I touch
This mournful string, so often, and so much,
As in this Book I do; that I might show
To them that of these griefs forg^^full gro^,
What sorrows and what dangers ^hey have had;
That all of us more thankful may be made:
And if to any these things do appear
Or tedious, or impertine^t; I fear
That most of them are they, who take no pleasure,
For good and useful things to be at l^isure.
And more delight in Poems worded out,
Th^^ those that are Gods works employed about.
Me thinks, I cannot speak enough of that
Which I have seen; nor full enough relate
What I declare; but (...) it seems to me
I leave out somewhat that should utt'red be.
For, though in most, the sense thereof be gone,
It was God's Judgment, and a fearful one.
And, LONDON, what availed then thy pride,
Thy pleasures, and thy wealth so multiplied?
Or, then, oh! what advantage did thou get
By those vain things, whereon thy heart is set?
How many several Plagues did God prevent,
Before this Judgment was upon thee sent?
How many loving ^avours had he done thee,
Before so roughly he did seize upon thee?
And, that thou might his purposes discover,
How long togethe^, did he send thee over
The weekly news, of those great Desolations,
Which he infl^cts on many other Nations?
How often did he send, e're this befell,
His Prophets, of his Judgments ^o foretell?
How many thousand Preac^ers has he sent,
With tears, to pray, and woo thee ^o repent?
To ^ell t^ee, that thy pride, and thy exc^sse,
Thy lusts, thy surfets, and thy drunkenness,
Thine idleness, thy great impieties,
Thy much prophanenes^e, thy hypocrifies,
And other vanities, would bring at last
Those pl^gues where of thou now some feeling have*
How did thy Pastors to repent conjure thee?
How st^ongly did Gods Ministers assure thee
That all thy love, thy labor, and thy cost
Besto^'d on carnal pleasures, would be lost?
That, t^ou hereafter ^houldst become ashamed
Of that whereof thy comforts thou had framed;
And that those evils would at length befall
From which no mortal hand reprieve thee shall.
'Thou can not but acknowledge these things were
Even every moment, rounded in thine care;
And that thy Sons of Thunder did presage
What, for thy sins, should be thine heritage.
Yet, thou to hear their message did refuse.
And, as the stubborn unbeleeving Jews,
Despised all those Prophets, who foreshew'd
The times of their approaching servitude,
Yea, punished them, as troublers of the Land,
And such as weakened much the peoples hand:
So, thou accountedst of thy Teachers, then,
But as a crew of busie-headed men,
Who causlesly, thy quietness distu^bing,
Had for their sauciness, deserved curbing.
But with amazement, now thou do behold,
That they have no uncertainties foretold.
For, God in this one single Plague, comprised
Those other Judgments, all, epitomized;
Which for thy ruin he at large will send,
If this be not enough to work his end.
Observe this Pestilence, and thou shall see,
That as there may be some one sin in thee
With other great Transgressions interlaced,
So, diverse Plagues in this great Plague were placed,
It showed thee (in some fashion) their dist^esses,
Whom WAR, in a besieged Fort oppresses:
For, lo, thou were deprived of all Trade,
As if t^y Foes blockt up thy River had.
And, though no armed Host thy wall surrounded,
Yet (which was worse) thou by thy friends were bounded:
For, wha^soever person passed from
Thy Ports, upon an enemy did come.
And none more cruel to thy children proved,
Then some of thine, who from thy Pl^gues removed.
Confusion, and D^sorder, threatn^d thee,
(On which attends all the Pl^gues that be)
For, most of thy grave Senate, who did bear
Thy names of office, far departed were,
To other places; leaving thee, nigh spent
And languishing for want of Government.
Yea, they that were thy Trust, and thy Deligh^,
In times of health, did then ^orsake thee quite;
To teach us, that those men, and vanities,
Which have our hearts, in our prosperities,
Will in affliction be the first who leave us;
And, when we most expect, then most deceive us.
Oh! whither then; oh! whither were they gone,
Who, thy admired Beauty doted on?
Where did thy Lovers in those days appear,
Who did so court thee, and so often swear
Affection to thee? whither were they fled,
Whom thou have often with sweetest junkets fed?
And they, whom thou so many years, at ease,
Did lodge within thy fairest Pal^ces?
Where London, were thy skarlet Fathers hou^'d,
Who in thy glory, were to thee espoused?
What were become of all thy children, which
Were nursed at thy breast, made great, and rich
By thy good-huswifry? and whom we see
In thy prosperity so hugged of thee?
Where were thy rev'r^nd Pastors, who had pay
To feed thy Flocks, and for thy sin to p^ay?
(I must confess) the meanest, and some few
Of better sort, were in affection true,
And gave thee comfort. But, oh! where were those,
Those greater ones, on whom thy hand bestows
The largest portions? Those, who have professed
A zealous care of thee, above the rest?
Those, who (as I conceive) had undertaken
A charge that should not then have been forsaken?
Those many silken-Doctors, who did here
In shining satin Casso^ks late appear?
They who (till now, a thing scarce heard of ever)
Do flaunt it in their Velv^^, Plush, and Beaver.
And they, whom thou did honor far above
Those mean ones, who, then, showed thee most love?
Where were they? and, where were thy Lawyers too
That he^etofore, did make so much ado
Within thy Courts of Justice? Pre^hee, where
Were those Physicians, who so forward were
To give thee physic, when thou neededst l^sse,
And were but sick, of ease, and wantonness?
Where did their foot-cloth^ wait? where could thou call
For their assistance? what became of all
Their Diets, and Receipts? and why did they
In that necessity depart away?
Where lurckt those Poe^asters, who were wont
To pen thy Mummeries, and vainly hunt
For base reward, by soothing up the Crimes
Of our Grand Epicures, in lofty Rimes;
And do before each others Poems raise
The huitlesse Trophies of a truthlesse praise?
Da^'d none of all those matchless wits to tarry
This b^unt? That his experienced Muse might carry
This News to after times; and move compassion,
By his all-moving strains of Lamentation?
What, none bu^ me? me only leave they to it,
To whom they s^ame to yield the Name of Poet?
Well* if they ever had a mind to wear
The Lawreat Wre^th, they might have got it ^ere:
For though that my performance may be bad,
A braver Subject, Muses never had.
Where were thy t^oups of Ro^ers? where were they
Who in thy Chambers did the wantons play?
Provoking God Almighty, down^ to cast
Those plagues from which they fled away so fast?
Yea, whither were those Nothings, all retired,
Of whom thou were, of late, so much desired?
Alas! was there not any of all these
Who staid to comfort thee, in this Disease?
Did all depart away? And, being gone,
Leave thee to bear thy sorrows all alone?
Left they upon thy Tally all that sin,
Which had by them and thee, committed bin?
Yes, yes, they left thee: even all ^hese: and they
So left thee, London, when they went away,
That thy afflictions they did aggravate,
And make more bitter thy deplored Fat^.
A Dearth mixed also in this P^st was found,
For they who did in riches most abound,
(And should have helped to relieve the poor)
Departing hence, diminished thy store.
To other Borroughes they themselves betook:
Their sick distressed brethren, they fo^sook^,
And, lest on those that would be hospitable,
A b^rthen which to bear they were unable.
Those few, of worth, who did in thee remain,
Had multitudes of beggars to sustain;
And, from the Country (as before I said)
The sending of supply was long delaid.
There was a Famine also, which exceeded
This other; though the same by few was heeded.
We had not so much scarcity of bread,
As of that food wherewith our souls are fed.
For, of our Pastors (in the greatest dangers)
Some left us to the charity of Strangers.
And, many souls, whom they were bound to cherish
Deprived of timely sustenance, did perish.
Who could have thought, this Vineyard, heretofore
So fruitful; and wherein the salvage Bore
Of Turkey rooted not: and whose thick fence
Has long time kept, the Bulls of Bashan thence;
Should then (even in the Vintage t^me) be found
So bare of what, so lately did abound?
And, then (a thing worth note) when every Field
And meanest Villages did plenties yield?
Indeed, not long before, we surfeted,
And played the wantons with our heavenly bread.
Our appetite was cloyed; and we grew dainty,
And either loathed, or murmured at our plenty.
Yea, many of us, when at will we had it,
By private Cookeries, unwholesome made it.
For which, and for our base unthankfulness,
Our portion and allowance waxed less:
And, we who (like fond children) would not eat,
Unless, this man, or that man carved our meat,
Then (like poor folks, that of mere alms do live)
Were glad to take of any that would give*
The Laborers were few; the Harvest large:
And of the best of those that had the ch^rge
To sp^ead God^ ^able* so^e g^ew faint and tired
By th^i^ perpetu^ll trav^ile: some expired
Their p^infull soul ^s, and freely sacrifiz'd
Themselves for us, that we might be suffiz'd.
Among which ^ap^y number I do ^lesse
The memory of learned Mak^r^^sse,
And zealous Eton, who^e l^rge ^^ng^^g^tions,
Bemoaned their loss with h^a^ty l^me^^ations.
And worthily: for, ^hey di^ labor here
Wi^h cheerfuln^sse and in their C^lli^gs were
So truly diligent w^i^st vigor lasted,
That they then li^e blood, yea ^hei^ spi^its wasted;
And even unslackt the very ne^ves and powers
Of their own souls, to help enable ou^s.
To bury, nigh a hundred in a day,
To church, to ^arry, study, preach and pray;
To make b^ times; at ni^h^ late watch to keep;
To be distu^b'd at midnight from their sleep;
To visit him that on his deathbed lies;
Often to communicate; more often baptize;
And daily (and all day) to be in action,
As were those two, to give due satisfaction
To their great Flocks; mo^e Laborers there needed;
And their consumed strengths, it much exceeded.
But they are now at re^^: their w^ke is done,
Their Fight is finished: th^i^ G^ale is won:
And, though no Troph^e I to them can raise,
Save, this poor withe^'d Wreath of mortal praise;
Their Master (to reward their faithfulness)
For them rese^ved Crowns of Happiness;
Because, unto his household, they the Bread
Of life, in season, have distribute^.
Nor was the ^ood of life diminisht more
By such men's want alone, then heretofore.
But, to our discontent, we also had
Our d^e allowances the sho^ter made
Even by command. For, some (I know not why)
Had ^alsely mis in^orm'd Autho^ity,
That o^r promiscu^us meetings, at the Fast,
Increast the Plague: which wa^ believed in have.
And being urged, pe^haps, with such fane shewe^
Of Reason, as ^onj^cture could in^u^e;
(The matt^r ^ei^g aggrav^ted too,
With suc^ ^ntruth^, as t^ave^l to and fro)
The public p^eaching on the Fasting day,
Was, in an evil season, took aw^y.
For, when the flesh was fed, and soul deprived
Of two Repasts, which weekly we received,
Profaneness, and hard-hea^tednesse began
To get new rooting in the mind of man.
We miss^^ those good helps, and those examples
Which had been prea^hed to us in our Temples.
The poor did want full qui^kly, to their grief,
Those Alms the Fast b^ought out for their relief.
And, when with Prayers, Preaching did not go,
Our cold Devotions, did far colder grow.
What instrument of mischief might he be
Who caused that? And, what a ^oole was he!
If Wensday-Sermons help infect; I pray
What kept us safer on the Sabbath day?
Since most fast then till noone without refection?
Or, what at Funerals, did stop infection?
Good God! in thy affai^es, how vain (to me)
Does carnal Policy appear to be?
How apt is flesh and blood to run a course,
Which makes the souls condition, worse and wo^se?
To vent^re on eternal death how toward!
And in a temporal danger what a cowa^d!
Su^e, had not such a ^roject, had a scope
Beyond the reaching of the D^vils hope,
And be^n too damnable for any on^
To be his Procurator thereupon;
Some w^^l^ have made the motion that we might
Have lived ^xclu^ed from our Churches quite:
And, that ^ill ^od his hand should please ^o stay,
None should in publ^ke, either preach, or pray.
'Twa^ well the weekly number of the dead,
By Gods mere m^rcy, was diminished,
Before the prohibition of the Fast:
The Fi^nd had els^, for evermore, di^g^ac't
That Discipline: and carnal Pol^cy
H^d so insulted over Divinity,
That, in succeeding Ages, men unholy,
Would thence have proved, such Devotion, Folly.
But, God prevented it, that we should take
Go^d n^tice of it; and good uses make:
And I have mentioned it, that here I may
God's Wis^dome and Man's foolishness display.
Oh* let us to our Fasts again return;
Let us, for our omissions truly mourn;
And not capitulate with God, as tho
He, first his Rod out of his hand should throw,
He^e we would come unto him: for, if thus
A son of ou^s should bear himself to us,
It would our^ire exasperate the more;
And make the fault seem greater then before.
Why should we in an action that is just
The mercy of our gracious God distrust?
Or, unto any place be loath to go,
Where God is to be heard, or spoken to,
Through fear of that which may be caught at home
And in a thousand places where we come?
Our sins and plagues were public: so should we
In Prayers, and Tears, and Alms, and Fastings be.
^or, that s^rong D^vill which has tortured thus
Our general body, is not cast from us
By single Ex^rcismos: neither shall
Our p^iv^cies advantage us at all,
Except in what conduces to the health
Of private men, or of their private weal^h.
If we in close retirements (by our fear)
At ma^kets, or where worse Assemblies are,
Infected grow: the Devil, by and by
With us persuades, either to belie
The Church, our constant Fasting, or some one
Good wo^ke, or pious action we have done.
(As visiting the sick, in ti^e of need,
Or any other such like Christian deed)
For, he those practices does greatly spite,
And, to disparage them has much delight:
Because he sees, that such as are inclinde
To pious means, will soon by trial find,
Good hopes to thrive beyond their expectations;
Their knowledge, fool his cunning machinations;
Their faiths grow strong; temptations weak appear;
Their joy most perfect, where most sorrows are;
And know, that when the Lord of Hoasts is armed,
With all his Judgments, that, he least is harmed,
Who, bold through Love, selfe-trust quite from him throws
And, runs with confidence to meet his blows.
Let no man then be fearful to repair^
Unto the house of Preaching, or of Prayer;
Or, any whither else, those works to do,
Which he by Conscience is obliged to:
No, though the Devil in the passage lay,
Or strow'd most ^earfull dangers in the way.
For, if in such a case, our death we t^ke,
Our death, shall for our best advantage ^ake.
Yet, let none think I this opinion carry,
That every Church, will be a Sanct^a^y,
To all that come For, sure, if any dare
Without Devotion* in Gods house appear,
To them, that pl^ce, more pe^ill threaten^, then,
A chamber thronged with infected men.
Some fainted in the Church, as others did
Within their houses (where themselves they hid)
Yet not so often. For* though some did please
To blame the Church for spreading this disease,
No places were more harmless. None did we
Beh^ld more healthy, or to sc^pe more free
From this Infection, then those persons, whom
We saw most often, to Gods worship come.
Nor were there any houses more infected
Then theirs, who most the house of God neglected.
I spe^ke not this by rumor: For, even thither
Resorted I, where thronged were together
The greatest multitudes: And day by day
I sat* where all the crowd I could survay.
Yet, I nor man, nor child, nor woman saw,
To finke, look pal^, or from their place withdraw*
And, d^ubtlesse, if such faintings there had been,
As many prated of; I some had seen.
Which, since I did not see, I wish ag^ine,
None would at such a time, Gods house refrain,
Except in Congregations not their own,
And w^ere in^ection feared is, or known:
Or in their own Assembly, where disorder
Committed wilfully, the Pest may further.
Or, when their body's weak^ne^, or the Air
Their ^afet^es may ^ome other wa^es impair.
Excepting to (^n ^imes of Visitation,
When they a^e ma^kt with ma^kes of Separation,
As Rising, Bl^^es, or So^es. O, newly from
The ^^mpany of such like persons, come.
Or, whensoe^er they or do^, or may
Suppose themselves Infectio^s any way.
These (as the ^epers did, by Mose Law)
From public Congregations should withdraw,
For, sure, if any such themselves intrude
To mix among a h^althy Multitude,
(Though p^ayers or devotions they pretend,
Or whatsoever other pious end)
Their foolish practice is unwarrantable;
Yea, their condition so uncharitable,
That I abhor it: and bel^eve that for
So doing, God their prayers does abhor^e:
And, here, (although it may impertinent
By some be thought) I cannon choose but vent,
How I dislike, ou^ so much liked fashion
Of b^riall, where the public Congregation
Are bound to meet: And then* especially,
When of ^nfectious griefs great number^ dye.
I know both Custom^, and Opinion, have
So rooted thi^, that I my breath may save
In reprehending it. Yet, when I must
Be taken hence, and turn again to dust,
Let naught but Earth and Heaven my carcass cover,
And neither Church nor Chapel roof^ me over;
Nor any other Buildings, saving those
That only serve, such relics to enclose.
For, though I do ingenuously confess,
W^ should to show our Christian hopefulnesse
Of rising from the dead, lodge decently
Their flesh, who in Christ's Faith p^ofesse to dye:
And, that Churchyards, or plots distinguished from
The vulgar use, do best of all become
That purpose. Yet, I know the common guise
Of bur'ing in the Church, did first arise
From ancient Superstition; and to gain
Some outward profit, to the priestly tr^ine.
For, many simple men were made conceive
That if (when they were d^ad) they might have leave
To rest within those plots of hallowed ground,
Which either Church or Chapel did surround*
No wicked Spirit should permittance have,
To trouble or abuse them, in the grave:
Whereas (which yet old fools believe they do^)
They might else rise, and walk at midnight too
About their streets, and houses, or cross ways;
Till some Masse-monger them at quiet lay^s:
And then it was supposed, how much the nigher
They lay unto their Altar, or their Choire,
By so much more the safer they should rest;
Which ^^ought no petty sums to Dagons chest:
Thence was it, that our Churches, first of all,
Were glazed with Scutchions like a Heralds hall;
And that this age in them depainted sees
So many vain and lying Pedigrees.
Thence comes it that we now adays behold
Some Chancels filled up with rotten, old,
And foolish monuments. From hence we see
So many puppet Images to be
On every wall within our Oratories:
So many Ep^taphs, and lying stories,
Of men deceast* and, thence the guise was gotten,
To let so many Banners dropping rotten
Deforme our pillars; and withdraw our ^yes
From picus objects to those vanities.
If any man desirous be to lie
Within a Monument, when he shall dye:
Let ^v'ry noble Family erect
Without their Cities some fair Architect,
Within the compass of whose roofed wall
There may be founded some good Hospital
Or build^ngs for the law^ull r^^reation
O^ youth, and for the honor of the Nation.
And of that Name or kin, when any dies,
There lay their bones; or to their memories
Erect there Tables. And, let them tha^ had
Such minds, and fortunes, to the Structure ad^e.
Yea thith^r (if they please) let them transl^te
Their Ancestors. But, I have spoke too late,
Those time^ ^re past in which our noble ones
Were able to ^rect such piles of stones
As might be emin^nt. Our kingly race
Had by the s^ven^h H^n^y such a place
Erected for them, so magnificent,
That to this Land it is an ornament.
^et them that cannot reach the cost of these,
Raise Cawsies, Bridge^, and make Docks, and Keys
For public use: which with as little cost
As now upon their pedling Tomb, is lost,
Should make them live far longer in their fames;
For* we would those entitle by their Names.
All they that love their Country, ^ow they know
Which way they may their money best b^stow,
(^o memorize their Friends, with profiting
The public) will consider of this thing
And build them Tombs where we may praise the work*
Not in a Church obscure, unseene to lurk,
Where few shall view them; and where most who shall
Be^old them, take no heed of them at all.
If some good Patriot would begin the fashion,
It ^ig^^ allu^e, perhaps, to imitation.
And if it were not gr^edinesse of gain
Am^ng Church Officers, which did maintain
Such Custom^s w^ should som^what more forbear
To lay so ^any sti^king bod^es there
Where God we s^^ke (and him should seek to find,
With ^urity of body, and of m^nde)
Indeed our s^^ne, alone pollutes; and yet
An ou^ward decen^y is also fit.
Was It well, that in the Church (where throngs and beat
Did mak^ us in the crowd to pant and sweat)
Ev^n in the midst of our Devotions too,
Men should, as often it pleased t^em to do,
Thrust in (where we could hard^y stand in e^se)
With f^ure or five strong sm^lling Carcasses?
Was'^ fit, so many Gr^ves, at such a season
Should g^^e and brea^h upon us? was it reason*
That heaps of ru^bish, C^ffin-boards, and stones*
Late bu^y'^ bodies, and halfe^ (...) bones,
God's Templ^ should poll^te? and make it far
More loath some, then most Charnell ^ouses are?
Was It fitting that to gain their griping fees,
They should endang^r multitudes to leese
Their lives, or healths? or, that they should fulfill
A fool^sh motion in a dead man's will,
By wronging o^ the living? God ^orbid
It should ^e reason; and yet, thus they did.
Thus did they? yea, far worse: f^r should I tell
At what high rates, some Churchmen, here, did sell
Their burying grounds: What feet they did exact:
H^w Readers, Clerks, and Sextons did compact,
To rack the de^d: to what a goodly sum
Their large Church-duties (in some cases) come:
What must ^e p^id for Bearers, though m^n have
Their friends to help convey them to the grave:
What for the B^lls, though not a Bell b^ rung:
What, for their mourning clothes, though none be hung
V^on them but their own: what pay did pass
For F^n^rall S^rmons, where no Sermon was:
And, what was often extorted (without shame)
To give him leave ^o preach, who f^e^ly came:
If her^ (I say) I should discover that
I might, of t^ese things m^n^ioned, rel^^e,
Those men who die, that charges they may s^ve,
Would f^are they might be legger^d in the Grave:
For, more ^o take th^^ lodging ha^^ ^eene spent,
Then would h^ve bought a pret^y tenement.
Thus, a^ one matter drew another on,
My Muse has diverse things discourst upon
To many sund^y purposes: but, what
I chiefly in this Can^o aimed at
Was, to prese^ue in mind an awful sense
Of what we suf^red in this Pestilence:
What we deserved; and how variously,
Gods Justice, this one Cors^ve d^d apply,
To eat out all Corruptions, which be spotted
Our souls, and h^d ere this our bodies rotted.
I might as well have memorized here,
How diversely God's Merci^s did appear,
Amid his Judgments: ^ow he comforted,
When outwa^d com^o^t failed: how he sed,
When oil and meal were wasted: how he gave
Their lives to them, whose feet were in the grave.
What Patience* what high Fortitude he granted,
And, how he still supplied what we want^d.
I might commemorate, a world of Grace
Bestowed in this affliction, on this place,
Both common, and in private. Many a vow
(Of theirs, who will, I fear, forget it now)
Was daily heard. Ten thousand suits were daigned;
Repri^ves, for souls condemned were obtained*
Friends prayed for friends; the parents for the lives
Of their dear children* Husbands for their wives;
Wives for their husbands begged with tears and passion,
And, God with pity heard their lamentation.
In friends, in servants, in the temporal wealth,
In life, in death, in sicknesses, and health,
God manifested Mercy. Some did find
A Friend, to whom till then, none had been kind.
Some, had their servants bettered, for them, there,
By Gods correction. Some, left wealthy were
By dying kindred, who the day before
Were like to beg their bread from door to door,
Some, by their timely deaths were taken from
Such present pains, or from such woes to come,
That they are happy. Unto some, from heaven,
The blessing of a longer life was given,
That they might call ^o mind their youthful times
Repent omissions, and committed crimes;
Amend their courses, and be warisome
That they displeased not God, in ^imes to come.
Again, some others by their sicknesses,
And by the fears they had in this Disease,
Grew awful of Gods Judgments; and within
Their hearts, good motions were, where none had bin*
Even in their hearts who feared nor God nor Devil,
Nor guilt of sin, nor punishment for ^vill.
And, some had health continued, that they might
Gods praise ex^oll, and in his love delight.
Should I declare, in what unusual wise
God opened here their souls dimsighted eye^,
Who blinded were before; how nig^ they reached
To highest Mysteries: what things they preached
Even to their neighbors, and their family,
Before their souls did from their bodies fly;
Or, should I tell, but what young Children here
Did speak, to take from e^der folk their fear
O^ Sicknesses and Death; what they expressed
O^ heavenly bliss, and of this worlds unrest;
What faith they had; what strange illuminations;
What strong assurances of their salvations;
And with what proper terms, and boldness they
Beyond their years, such things did open lay,
It would amaze our Naturallists, and raise
A goo^ly Trophee to our M^kers praise.
But, this for me were too* too large a task,
And many years and volumes it would ask,
Should I in these particula^s record
The never ending mercies of the Lord.
For, he that would his meanest act recite,
Attempts ^o measure what is infin^te.
That story therefore, in particular
To med^le with I pu^pose to defer
Till in the Kingdom of eternity
My soul in honor of his Majesty
Shall Halelu^ah ^ing; and over-looke
With hallowed eyes, that great eternal Book,
Which in a moment to my view shall bring
Each passed, present, and each future thing,
And there my soul shall read, and see revealed
What is not by the LAMB, as yet, un^ealed.
Mean while I Will cry Hosannah, and for all
His love to me, and mercies general,
His three times holy, and thrice blessed Name
I p^aise, and vow for aye to praise the same.
The fifth Canto.
The Author justifies again
His Method, and his low^y Strain.
Next, having formerly made known
The common Fears, he tells his own.
Shows with what thoughts he was diseased,
When first the Plague his lodging seized:
Of what God's Justice him accused;
Upon what Doubts, or Hopes, he mus^d;
On what, and how, he did resolve;
And who from Death, did him absolve.
The Plagues increase, he then expresses:
The Mercies of the LORD confesses:
Emplores that he himself may never
Forget them, but, be thanke^ull ever:
Then, mounting Con^emplations wings,
Ascends to high and useful things.
From thence his Muse is called down*
To make Great Britains errors known:
Wherein, he does confess a sailing;
And (his infirmities bewailing)
Is fitted and resolved anew,
His purposed Message to pursue:
And, having first anticipated,
His Arrant is, in part, rel^ted.
PErhaps, the nicer Cri^ickes of these times,
When they shall sl^ightly view my lowly Rimes,
(Not to an end, these Poems fully reading,
Nor their Occasion, nor my Aims, well h^eding)
May tax my Muse that she at random flies;
For want of Method, makes Tautelogies;
And comes off, and on, in such a fashion,
That* often she ^a^les their curious expectation.
It is enough to me, that I do know
What they commend, and what they disallow.
And let it be enough to them, that I
Am pleased to make such faults for them to spy.
For I intend the Method which I use*
And, if they do not like it, they may c^use.
They who in their Composures, keep the fashion
Of elder times, and write by imitation;
Whole quaint Inventions must be trimd and trickt,
With curious dressings, from old Authers picked;
And whose maine works, are little ^l^e, but either
Old scattred Pieces, finely glew'd together;
Or, some concealed Structures of the Brain,
Found our (where long obscured they have lain)
And new attired: These, must (and well they may)
Their Poesies in formal garbes array,
Their natural defects by Art to hide;
And, make their old new-straines the Test abide.
These, do not much amiss, if they assume
Some ^stridge feath^rs, or the Peacockes plume
To strut withal: nor had I greatly h^eded
That course of theirs, if they had not proceeded
To c^nsure mine. My Muse no wh^t envies
That they from all their he^thnish Po^sies
Have skumm'd the Cream and to themselves (for that)
The s^ile of Prince of Poets a^^ogate.
For, Plautus, Horace, Perseus, ^uvenal,
Yea Greece and Romes best Muses, we may call
Their Tr^b^taries; since from them come in
Those Treasures which their princely Titles win.
Sometime, as well as they I play the Be:
But, like the Silkeworme, it best pleases me
To spin out mine own Bowels, and prepare them
For those, who think it not a shame to wear them.
My Matter, with my Method, is mine own;
And I do pluck my Flowers as they are blown.
A Maiden when she walks a^road to gather
Some herbs to strew the dwellings of her Father,
(Or fragrant flowers to deck her wedding Bower,
Or make a nosegay for her Paramour)
She comes into the Garden, and first seizes
The Flowers which first she sees, or what she pl^aseth;
Then runs to those whom use or memory,
Presents to her thought, or to her eye:
As toward them she ^asteth, she does find
Some others, which were wholly out of mind^,
Even till that very moment: while she makes
Her prise of those, she notice likewise takes
Of Herbs unknown before, that lurking lay
Among the pleasant Plants within her way:
She crops off these, of those she takes none,
Makes use of some, and lets as good alone;
Here plucks the Cowslips, Roses of the prime,
There, Lavander, sweet Marj^r^m, and Thine,
Yon^ Iuly^low'rs, or the Damask Rose,
Or sweet-breathed Violet, that hidden grows*
Then some again forenam'd (if need she thinks)
Then Daisies, and then Marigolds, and Pincks:
Then Herbs anew, then Flowers afresh does pull,
Of every fort, until her lap is full.
And otherwhile, before that work be done,
To kill a Caterpiller she does run,
Or catch a Butterfly; which varies from
That purpose whereabout she first did come.
So, from the Muses Gardens, when I mean
Those flow'r^ of useful Po^sie to gleane,
Which being well united may content
My Christian Friends; or with a pleasing sent
Perfume Gods house, or beautify, or cheer
My soul, which else would rude, and sad appear*
When this I mean; I paint out every Tho^ght,
As to my heart I feel it to be brought:
I t^eat of things, as cause conduces to them,
And as occasions, unto me, do show them.
Some^imes, I from the matter seem to go,
For purposes, which none but I may know
Sometime, an useful Flower I may forget;
Anon, into my Nosegay, I do set
Some other twice; because, perchance, the place
Affo^ds it better use, or better grace.
A^ one conceit I seriously pursue,
That, brings perhaps another to my view,
And that another; and that, many a one,
Which if in M^thods Allies I had gone,
Ha^, peradventure, ^lse remained unseene;
And, in my Gar^and might have missed been.
E're I my pen assume, I feel the motions
Of doing somewhat, and have general notions
O^ what I purpose: But, Mogul does know
As well as I, what path my Mus^ will go.
What, in particular, I shall express,
I know not (as I hope for hap^inesse)
And though my matter, when I first begin,
Will hardly fill one p^ge; yet being in,
Me thinks, if neither faintness, friends* nor night,
Disturbed me, for ever I could wri^e.
Upon an in^tant I often feel my breast
With infinite variety possessed;
And such a troup of things together throngs,
Within my brain; that, had ^ twenty tongues
I should (wh^lst I assai^ to utter it)
Twice more, then I could mention, quite forget.
A hundred Masings, which I mean to say,
Before I can express them, slip away;
Which to recall, although I much endever,
Often pass out of my memory, for ever;
And carry forth (even to the wo^lds ^arre end)
Some other thoughts, which did on them depend.
Whilst I my pen am dipping down in ink,
That Is lost which next to tell you I did think;
And, somewhat instantly does follow on,
Which till that present, I never thought upon.
This, fo^ceth me those Methods to forgo,
Which others in their Poems fancy so.
This makes me ^i^th to my Concep^ions give,
As fast as they the^r Beings do receive.
Left whilst I for the common Midwife ^ary,
The fl^tting is^ue of my brain miscary.
And, howsoever they please to censu^e me,
Who but Stepfathers to their Poemes be;
This, is that way of uttrance that e^ch Muse
Makes practice of, whom Nature ^o^h infu^e:
And, warrant from their Natural strai^es does fet*
Whom Artifi^iall Poets counterfeit.
These a^e true Raptures; ^h^irs are imitations,
Or, rather, of old Rap^u^es* new Translations.
Thi^ Method long ago, old Moses used,
When God ^is Hymn of ^raise, to him in^used.
Thus, Solomon hi^ Song of Songs, compased:
And, when thy sin^er, ^s^^el, was disposed
To praise the Lord or sp^a^e unto his God,
O^ ven^ his passiens in a mou^^^u^l Ode,
In thi^ contemned wi^e, from him did flow,
Those heavenly Raptur^s which we honor so.
As God's good Spirit cary'd him along,
So varied he, the m^tter of ea^h Song.
Now prays; straight praises; instantly l^menteth;
Then half d^spaires; is by and by contented;
The person of the changes; often ^epeate^h
One sentence; and one su^t often iter^teth.
Which manner of expression, s^emes to some
So methodlesse, and so to wander from
A certainty, in what he did intend,
That they his well-knit Raptures discommend,
As broken and di^ jointed; when, indeed,
From ignorance (or from their little heed
To such exp^essions, and such mysteries)
Their cau^elesse disesteeme, did first a^ise.
Yea, Ignorance, not knowing what they meant,
When such an uncouth p^th the Muses w^nt;
Was wont (long since) to call our soule-rapt strains,
Poetic Furies: And that Name remains.
Yet, this old tr^ct I follow; this I use;
And, this no true-borne Poe^* can refuse.
My scope, I ever keep, in all my Lays;
Which is, to please, and profit, to Gods praise:
But, in one path, or in one pace to ride,
It is not fi^ a P^^^ should be tied.
Sometime he must be grave; lest else, the wi^e
The m^tter, or the m^^ner, may despise.
Sometime he must en^evor to be plain,
Lest all that he d^^ivers be in vain:
Another wh^le, he Parables must use,
And ^iddl^s, lest some should the truth abuse,
And they that are the Nymrods of the times
Grow mad, in slead of leaving often their crimes.
Sometime he must be pleasing, le^t he may
Drive all his frow^rd Re^ders quite away.
Sometimes he must have bu^er stroine^, to keep
The sullen Reader from a drow^ie sleep;
And whip those wantons, from an evil course,
That, without wa^ning, would be dai^y worse.
Sometimes again, he must be somewhat merry,
Lest Fools, of good instruction, should be weary.
Yea, he to all men all things should become,
That he, of many, might a^vantage some.
This, m^kes me chang^ the Person, and the Style,
And vary from the matter, other while.
Thi^, makes me mix^ small things, and great together;
Here, I am grave; there, play I with a fea^her.
One page, does make some Reader half believe,
That I am angry: In the next, I give
The C^ilde an Aple. In one leaf^, I ch^de;
I somewhat in another do provide,
To help excuse those ^railties I ^eproved:
And those excus^s, are in place ^emoved,
From such reproves; left following on too nigh,
The Che^k, might without heed, be p^ssed by.
This course b^c^me^ the Muses. This does save
Our ^ines from just reproof, when Tyrants rave
At our free Numbers: and when Fools condemn
Our Straine^, because they understand not them.
Such Po^fie is right: and, therefore* they
Who study matter, and what words to say,
Do falsely arrogate to be inspired;
Since, when they boast their souls are this way fired,
It is but Wine, or Passion ma^es them rave:
And thence the Muses their disgraces have.
Most times, when I compose, I watch, and fast.
I cannot find my Spirits, when I taste
Of meats and drinks; nor can I write a line,
Sometime, should I but take one draught of wine.
Men say, it makes a Poet, and does warm
His brain, and him with strong invention arm.
No m^^vell then, that most do reckon me
For none, who of this Age the Poets be;
And* that so ^nviously at me they strike,
For they and I are not inspired alike.
In such like works as these, if I should fill
My head, my Muse would have an empty qu^ll;
And* that which to express she then presumes,
Would smothered be, with vapourings and fumes.
But, when those write; themselves they first make merry
With Claret, with Canary, or with Sherry.
And these are sure the Deities which make
A sensual ear, of them, best liking take.
When such as they reprove a sinful State,
Or would those great enormities relate,
Wherein their times offend; they may be brough^
To question for it; and it may be thought
Their sple^ne, revenge, or envy, did incite
Their brains to hammer, what their pens did write,
Because they did premeditate, and strain
Their faculties, their projects to attain.
But, when a man one Subject purposing,
Sits down to write it, and another thing
(Unthought upon before) qu^te thrusts out
That matter which at first he went about:
When he remembers, that nor spite, nor spleen,
No^ envy, has his primus motor been:
When he perceives, nor dangers, nor disgrac^
Can fright him, when such Raptures are in place:
When he does find, that with much ease and pleasure
He utters what exceeds the common measure
Of his own Gifts: and that (although his Rimes
Are none of those strong lines that catch the times)
They from the V^rtuous, good respect can draw,
And keep the proudest vitious-men in awe:
What should he think, but that the power of God
Ins^ireth him, to show his will abroad?
What nee^ he fear, but, most undantedly,
Make use of his inspired Faculty?
No arrogance it were, if he, or I,
Should say that God our pe^s had spoken by,
To those we live among, since, we might say,
He speak^s by all his creatures, every ^ay:
Yea, since in elder times it came to pass^,
That he declared his pleasure by an ^sse.
What should we do but speak, when we are willed?
What can we do but speak when we are filled?
While wicked men we do^ remain among,
With David, w^ a while may curb the tongue;
But, burn it will within us, ti^l we speak,
And forth, at last, some thundering voice will break*
And what should then our hearers do, but learn
Their errors, by our Poems, to disce^ne?
Why should they rail at u^, who neither fea^e
Then fury, nor for all their threatenings care?
Why do they, childishly, our Lines condemn,
That strike but at their sollies, not at them?
Why, so unjustly still, are we pursued,
Who show them ho^v their falls may be eschewed?
And why do they by seeking of our shame,
Increase our glor^es, and themselves defame?
Whence comes all this, but from that sot^i^hnesse
Which does most people of this age possess?
But, let these questions pass; lest by degrees,
They draw us on, until our ma^ke we leese.
Thus far my Muse has wilfully digrest,
And of he^ purpose, now she vents the ^est.
When diverse weeks together ^ had wasted
In vi^wing th^se afflictions others tasted;
When day by day, ^ long had walked abroad,
Beholding how the scou^ging hand of God,
Afflict^d other men, and how, each morning
My going out, and ^ow my b^ck ^etu^ning,
Was every night in safety; I be^an
Gods care and my unworthiness to scan.
And, 'twas, me thought, a favor, which required
To be both much acknowledged, and ^dmi^ed;
That (when so many houses, ^v'ry day,
Were visited) the place wherein I lay
Stood free so long; considering we were many,
And, then, ^esorted to, as much as any.
But, th^re was somewhat needful to be known,
Which no man's grief could (...) me but mine own.
And, that I might thereof in^ormed be,
God sent at last his Judgments home to me.
Y^a, peradventure, in my soul he saw
Some ^ailings of my former filial awe;
Some thanklesnesse; some inward pride of heart;
Or over-ween^ng of mine own desert,
Arising from the merciful protection
W^ic^ he vouchsafed me from this In^^ction;
And t^erefore sent as my Reme^bra^cer,
His dread^ull, and his bloody Messenger
To t^ke his lodging, where my lodgings were;
And put his rage in execu^ion there.
For, in upon us, that Contagion broke,
Five souls out of our Gate, it quickly took,
And left another wounded; that I might
Conceive my danger, and Gods love, a^ight.
It fell about the time in which their sum
Who weekly died, to the full was come:
Then, when infection to such height was grown,
That many dropped on a sudden down
In every street: yea, when some fools did tell
The lying Fables of the Falling-B^ll
At Westminster; and how that then did fly
No Bird through Londons air which did not dye.
Even then it was. And, though some few did please,
By such like tales, and strange Hyperboles,
To overstraine the stories of our so^row:
They did but needlessly their fictions borrow
To set it forth. Nay, their false rumors made
Our woes appear less great, then those we had.
Till now, I made the smart o^ othe^s known:
The Griefs I next will tell you, are mine own.
At first, I stood as one who from a Tower*
Beholding how the swo^d does such ^evo^^e
(Who in the streets beneath him fig^ti^g be)
Accounts himself from danger to be free.
But, at the last, I fared, as it fares
With such, whose Foes have made, at unawares,
A breach upon their Bulw^rke; and I stood
No mean assaults, to make my standing stood.
For, both within me, and without me, too,
I had enough, and full enough to do.
No sooner to my Chamber was I gone,
But, I was followed straight, and set upon
By strong Assailants, who did much intrude,
And much disease me, by their multitude.
My Reason, who to Faith did lately stoop,
Revolted, and brought on a mighty troup
Of trayt'rous Arguments, whereby she thought,
On this my disadvantage, to have wrought.
Temptations, slye- Suggestions, Fear, and Doubt,
Did undermine, and close me, round about.
My Conscience did begin to be afraid
My Faith had been a false one; who betrayed
My Soul to Death: and (whether then it were
The power of strong I^fection, or else Fear,
Occasioned by those combatings within,
Or both together) I did then begin
To find my body weakened more and more,
And felt those pangs, till then unfel^ before.
Even many days together, so it fared:
And sure, if Superstition could have scared
My better settled heart, there happened that,
Which I had feared, and somewhat startled at:
And (though I never outwardly complained
To any one, of that which I sustained)
That week, in which our house was visited,
And made complete the number of her dead;
I had a sleeplesse night; in which with heat
Oppressed, I purged out (in stead of swear)
Round-rud^y-spots (and, that, no little store)
Which on my breast, and shoulders, long I wore.
Perhaps, it was the Pestilence, which then
So ma^ked me* and I, as other men,
By her had been devoured, had I not
Through Gods great mercy, my free pardon got.
Which, how, and on what terms, the same I gained,
I^e now declare. For, though they seem but feigned*
Or melancholy thoughts, which here I tell;
Yet, sure, to smother them, I did not well.
For, some, perhaps will think (as well as I)
That none should slightly pass such musings by:
And some (who at first viewing will surmise,
That in these things I merely poetise)
Will find, perchance, in times that shall ensue,
Expe^imentall proof, that all is true;
Should D^rk^esse, where her visage, Danger, shows,
(^t such a disadvantage) them enclose.
When all alone I lay, and apprehended,
How many mischiefs my poo^e soul attended;
I plainly saw (though not with ca^nall eyes)
God's dreadful Angel, ready to su^prise
My trembling soul; and every hideo^s fear,
Which can to any natural man appear,
(In such a case, to aggrava^e his terror)
Approacht, with every circumstance of horror.
I ^aw the Muster of each passed evil,
And all my youthful follies, by the Devil
Brought in against me, marshalled* and prepared,
To fight the battle which I long had feared.
And such a mult^tude of them sur^ounded
My Conscience, that I was almost con^ounded.
A thousand sins appeared which were forgot,
And which I till that moment minded not,
Since first committed; and more ugly far
They seemed, then when they perp^trated were.
Yea many things whereof I bragged, and thought
That I, in doing them, some good h^d wrought,
Declared themselves against me; and I found
That they did give my soul the deepest wound.
When these had quite enclosed me, I saw
The Tables, and the Volumes of the Law*
To me laid open: and I was, me thought,
Before the presence of God's Justice brought,
Who from her eye did frowns upon me dart,
And se^med, thus to speak unto my heart.
(Oh! Readers mark it well; for to this D^ome,
O^ to a worse then this, you all must come.
Suppose thou not, vain man, thou do possess
This lif^ till now, for thine own righteousness,
Or that thou merit^st mo^e grace to have
Then they who now are sent to fill the Grave:
Lo, here, thy Foe has brought of thy offenses
An Army, and so many evidences
Of thy Corruption; that, plead what thou will
Of merit in thy self, they prove a guilt
So heinous, that thy soul thou can not free:
Yet other sinful thoughts of thine I see.
I search thy heart, and ^^ discover there
Deceits, which cannot to thy self appear*
I know thy many secret imperfections,
I know thy passions, and t^y vain affections;
And, that performances thou have not made
According to those favo^rs thou have b^d.
Vaineglory, profit, or some carnal end,
Thy best endeavor alw^yes did attend;
And, as distrusting, God would thee beguile,
An arm of flesh thou se^kest otherwhile:
Not as the second, but the chiefest Cause:
Which from the glory of thy God withdrawes.
Mine eye does see what arrogance and pride
Thou do among thy f^irest virtues hide;
And, what impieties, thou should have done,
Had I not stopped the course thou though^st to run.
Of^ ^^mes, when others Vices, thou have shown,
Thou have forgotten to repent thine own.
And, many times, thy ta^t reproves have been
The fruits, not of thy Virtue, but of Spleen.
Thy wanton Lus^s (b^t that I did restrain
Their f^ry, when thou w^uldst have slackt the Reine)
Had horn thee he^dlon to those deeds ^f shame,
With which thy evil willers blur thy Name.
Should thou have done the best that thou were able,
Thy services had been unprofitable:
But, thou scarce h^lfe thy Talent have employed;
And, that small good thou did, is nigh destroyed,
By giving some occasion, needlessly,
Of questio^ing thy true sincerity.
God of^ has hid thy frailties, and thy sin,
Which being known, would thy d^sgrace have bin.
The show of Wit and Virtue, thou have had,
He, to the world more eminent has made,
Then theirs, who wiser, and much better are,
Though outward helps, and fortunes, wanting were*
And, though thy knowledge, and thy former Lays,
Among your formal Wizzards got no praise,
Yet what they co^nted foolishness, became
A greater honor to thy slighted Name,
Then they obtained: And, that Grace (I see)
Begot more pride, then thankfulness in thee:
And, I was feign, to let some scandals fly,
To teach unto thee, more h^mility.
In all thy wants, thou still have been relieved;
From heaven thou comfort had, when thou w^rt grieved*
When Princes threatened, thou were fearlesse made;
In all thy dangers, thou a Guard have had;
In closest prison, thou best freedom gainedst;
In great contempts, thou most esteem obtainedst;
When, most thy fo^s did labor to undo thee,
They brought most honor, and most profit to thee.
Yea, still when thy destruction was expected,
Then, God, thy peace beyond thy hope, effected.
And, in the stead of praising him for this,
Thou robdst him of much honor that was his.
Tho^ w^rt content, to hear the Vulgar say,
Thy Spirit, and thine Innocence made way
To ^^y escape. Whereas, thy ^ons^ience kn^w
Thou were a ^oward, till God ^id ^n^ue
Thy heart with Fortitude, and f^^ely gave thee
That innocence which from harm d^d save thee.
When God thy Name div^lg'd for some good end,
(Which his w^se Providence and soreintend)
Thou took'st the glory of it for thi^^ ^wne,
And, justly, therefore thy so being known,
Has been a m^^n^s whereby t^y Fo^^ h^ve sent
Their scandal f^r^her, then they else ha^ went.
As soon^ as, God from trouble ^id release thee,
(O^, but with ^^pes of ou^w^rd things possess thee)
Some fruitless thoughts d^d quit^ thy heart estrange,
And after such vain Project ^ake thee range,
That he was o^t compeld to put thee from
Those blessi^g^, which (...) to thy lips were come;
Lest, being then unseas'na^ly received,
Thou might of better things have been ^ere^^ved*
F^w men so nigh great Hopes attained ^ver*
With such small fortunes and without en^eavor,
As thou have done* and f^we^ have been crossed*
That way (which thou h^s^ been^) in what was lost;
That see and kn^w thou might, such loss and gain,
He sent; and, that he neither sent in vain.
Yea, that those evils which thou h^dst in thought,
Should escape the being into action brough^,
Ill ^ong^es w^^e stirred to prevent the f^ct,
By blazing what was never yet in act:
Bu^, might have been, perhaps* had not that er^ed
Thy heart* whereby t^y foes would thee h^ve harmed.
Thou to refresh thy soul h^st pleas^res had,
And tho^ by their abuse, have f^^bl^r ma^e
Her use^^ll F^culties. Thou have ^nj^yed
Youth, strength, an^ health; and* them have mis employed.
Thy God has made thee gracious in their eyes,
Whose good esteem, thy soul does highly prise;
And (of ill purpose though Il^ not condem^e
Thy love, or meaning, to thy self or them)
Thou have full often stole their hearts away,
Even from themselves; and made thine own a prey
To many passions* which did sometimes bring
Upon your s^lves, a mutual torturing:
Because you did not in your loves propose
Those ends, for which, Affection, God bestows.
But, spent your hours (that should have been employed
To learn and teach how you should have enjoyed
Gods love) that flame, to kindle, in each other*
Wherein, you might have perished together.
Thou aggravated have thy pard'ned crimes,
And, it^rated them, a thousand times.
Even yet, thou do renew them every day;
And when for Mercy thou do come to pray,
Thou meri^est confusion, through that folly,
Which makes thy prayers to become unholy.
Nay, at this time, and in this very place,
Where God in Judgment stands before thy face,
Thou often forgetst the danger thou art in;
Forgetst Gods mercy, and do hourly sin.
Thou do neglect thy time, and trifle out
Those days, that should have been employed about
The service of the Maker. Thou do give
Thy self that liberty, as if to live
Or dye, were at thy choice* and that at pleasure,
Thou might pursue his work; and at thy leasu^^.
Thy Talent thou mis-spendst; and here, as though
To look upon Gods Judgments were enough
For thee to do; thou do with negligence
Perform thy vows; which add to thy offense.
And lo, for these thy faults, and many more;
Whereof thy Conscience thee does guilty know,
My spotted-Hound has seized thee: from whom,
That thou with life should ^eene have to come,
What can thou say* I could not make reply;
For, Fear, and Guilt, and that dread Majesty
Which I had apprehended, took away
My speech; and not a word had I to say.
But Merry who came arm in arm along
With Iusti^e, and about her always hung;
Did look, me thought, upon me with an eye
So truly pitiful, that instantly
My heart was cheered, and ( Mercy prompting her)
Such words, or thoughts as these she did p^efer.
It Is true most awful Justice, that my sin
Has greater then thine accusations bin*
The most refined actions of my soul,
Are in thy presence, horrible and foul.
And if thou take account of what is done,
I cannot of ten thousand answer one.
As soon as I am cl^^sed from my sin,
To sail my self anew* I do begin.
I to my vomit, like a Dog, retire,
And like a Sow, to wall^w in the mire.
I have within my soul, distempers, passions;
And hourly am besieged with strong temptations.
My Flesh is weak, except it be to sin;
My spirit faints, when I the goal should win.
My Will ^ff^cteth most, what is most vain;
My Memory does ^vill best retain.
That little good ^ would, I cannot do;
Those evil^ I detest, I fall into.
The vapors which from earthly things arise,
Too often veil heavens glories from min^ eyes.
And I, who can sometimes by contemplation,
Advance my soul above the common station,
(The world contemning) do^ sometime^ again
Lie grovelling on the ground with other men:
My Faith does fail; my mounting wings are clipped;
Of all my braveries I quite ^^n stripped*
My hopes are hid; my sins do me defile;
And in my own esteem, ^y soul is vile.
I will acknowledge all my aherrations,
According to their utmost a gravations;
And here consesse, that I deserve therefore
The loss of Mercies love for evermore;
Which were a greater plague, then to abide
All torments here, and all hell plagues beside.
But, I repent my sin: lo, I abhore it,
And, with my heart, am truly sorry for it.
I fear thine anger, (but, to fear the love
Of Mercy could be lost, would in me prove
A greater horror) and no slavish dread,
But loving fear, this grief in me has bred.
It pains my soul, that I who have conceived
Such pleas^re in thy favors, and received
Such to ens of thy love, from day to day,
Should pass a moment of my time away
In any va^i^y; or live to be
One minutes space without a thought of thee.
But, more I grieve, that I should more ^ransgresse
Then many do, whom thou have favored less.
Although I am a sinner* yet I vow,
I do not in my soul my sins allow;
But, I d^t^st them, and often p^ay, and strive,
That, I accord^n^ to thy Law may live.
(At least I think I do) and hopeful am,
My love to thee is true, though much to blame.
In me there how rely rise (against my will)
Those lusts which I should mortify and kill:
And as I am enabled, I do smite
As well the fat, as lean Amalekite.
But, if I have a sin that is become
My Ag^g; or as dear as Absalom,
I wish a Samuel, or a loab may
Destroy it e're my soul it shall betray.
For, if my heart has not it self deceived,
It would, wi^h willingness, be quite bereaved
Of what it most affects (yea, sacrifice
That which is dear^r then my hands, or e^es)
E're cher^sh, wittingly, w^thin my bre^^,
A thought, which thy uprightn^sse does detest.
Thou know, that I take no pleasure in
That act which I do fear to be a sin:
Much less if I do k^ow i^ so: and, this
Does bitt^r make it, when I do amiss.
Though in my ways my walkings, now and then,
Appear irregular to other men;
(And other while may shows of evil make)
Because from thence offenses others take,
Yet, thought I not, it less offended thee
To use it, then unused to let it be,
I would not tread once more in such a path,
To save my life, and all the joy it has.
But, should it cost my life I cannon tell
If (in some actions) I do ill or well.
For, many times, when I do se^ke to shun
A plash, into a whirlepoole I do run.
The Wolf I fly, and lo, a Lion frights me;
I shun the Lion, and a Viper bites me.
A scandal follows, if I take my course;
If I divert it, there (...) a worse.
If I persist in that which I intend,
It gives some occasion to offend:
If I forgo it; my own knowled esayes
I fin, and scandal give some other ways.
I find not in my actions, or affections
That thing that is not full of imperfections.
I cannot do a good or pious act
But there is somewhat evil in the fact,
Or in the manner; and it either ^ends
To this man's d^mmage, or that man offends,
Whatever I resolve upon, I find
It does not fully satisfy my mind.
I am so straightened, that I know not whence
To find the means of shunning an offense;
And, if dear Mercy, thou assist me not,
My fairest act will prove my foulest blot.
The Wo^ld, our Fri^nd^, our Passion, or our Fear,
Has so entangled us, at unaware,
With manifold engagements; and so draws
And win^es us, by degrees, into that Maze
Of endless Wanderings; that it leads us to
That sin, sometimes, which we abhor to do:
And, otherwhile so strangely giddifies
The Reason, and the souls best Faculties;
That (as I said before) we do not know
What in our selves to b^ke, or disallow.
Yea, we such turnings and cross ways do find,
That of^, our Guides (as well as we) ^e blind.
The Spirit and the Flesh have their delight,
In things, so diverse, and so opposite;
And, such a Law of sin does still abide
With^n our Members; that, we swarve aside
Do what we can: and, while we help the one,
To what seems needful, the ot^^^ is undone.
If by the Spirits motion, I proc^ed
To compass what I think my Soul may need,
My Body wants the while; and I am feign
To leave my course, that her I may sustain:
L^ft my engagements, or necessities,
Might my well meant endeavor scandalize.
If I but feed my Body, that it may
Assist my Spirit in some lawful way;
It straight grows wanton: If I fast, it makes
My spirit faint in what she undertakes:
And, if I keep a mean; mean fruits are they,
(And little worth) which then produce I may.
If in a Christi^n love some hours I spend
To be a comfort to some female friend,
Who needs my counfell: I do cause, ^he while,
Another with hot jealousies, to boil:
Nor know I how my self excuse I may
Unless another weakness I display.
Which if I do not, or some lie invent,
They censure me unkind, or impudent.
I can nor do, nor speak, nor think that thing;
But, still, some inconvenience it will ^ring;
Or, some occasion of anevill, be
To me, or others; or to them, and me.
And from the body of this Death, by whom
But, by my Savior, can I freed become?
Oh! therefore, sweet Redeemer, succor lend me,
And, from these bogs, and s^ares of sin, defend me*
Dear God, assist in these perplexities,
Which from our frail condition do arise.
S^t straight, I pray thee, Lord, ^he crookedness
Oferring Nature; and these faults redress.
So out of frame, is ev^ry thing, in me,
That, I can hope for cure, from none, but thee.
To thee I therefore kneel; to thee I pray;
To thee my soul complains; every day:
Do thou but say, Be whole; or be thou clean;
And, I shall soon be pure, and sound, again.
The Will thou gav^st me, to affect thy Will,
Though it continue not so perfect still,
A^ when thou first bestow'dst the same; accept it,
Even such as my polluted Vessel kept it.
For* though it wounded be, through many fights
Continued with my carnal appetites:
Yet, i^ my h^arts desire to me be known,
Thy Pleasure I prefer before min^ ow^e.
If I could choose, I would not guil^y be
Of any ^ct di^pl^asing unto thee.
In all my life, I would not sp^^ke a word,
But, that which to thy lik^ng might accord.
I would not think a thought but what might fhow,
That from thy Spirit, all ^y ^usings flow.
I would nor hate, nor love, nor hope, nor fear,
But as unto thy praise it useful were.
I would not have a joy within my heart,
Of which thou should^t not be the greater part.
Nor would I live or dye, or happy be
In life or death; but (Lord) to honor thee.
Oh! let this Will (which is the precious seed
Of thine o^^e Love) be taken for the deed.
Assist thou m^ against the potent evil
Of my great Foes, the World, the Flesh, the Devil.
Renew my fainting powers, my heart revive;
Refresh my spirits, and my soul relieve.
Lord draw me, by the cords of thy affection,
And I shall fall in love with thy perfection.
Unloose my chains, and I shall then be free;
Convert me, and converted I shall be.
Yea, to my soul (oh God!) and to my senses
Display thy beauty and thy exc^^lencies
So plain, that I may have them still in sight;
And thou shall ever be my sole delight.
The world though she should into pieces tear me
With troubles; from thy love should never scare me;
Nor ^ble be to tempt me from one duty
To ^he, with all her pleasure and her beauty.
Behold; I came to seek thee, Lord; even here,
Where, to attend thy presence most men fear.
Though here I saw the Pestilence withstand me,
I stand to know what work thou would command me.
From all the pleasures of the world, and from
Her hopes of safety, I am b^^her come
Where thou art angry: and to see thy frown
Am at thy feet, with terror, fallen down.
Yet, hence I would not fly (although I might)
To gain the chiefest of this worlds delight,
Till I perceive thou bidd^st me go away;
And, then, for twenty wo^lds, I would not stay.
I came as heartily as flesh and blood
Could come (that has in it so little good)
To do thee service: and, if dye I must*
Lo, here I am; and, I pronounce thee just.
Although thou sl^y me yet my soul well knows
Thou lov^st me: And I Will trust in thee repose.
Though in my self I feel I am polluted;
I find a better righteousness imputed
Then I have lost. Thy blessed Love does fill me
With joys, that will rev^ve me, though thou kill me.
My sins are great; ^ut thy compassion's greater.
I have thy Quittance, though I am thy Debtor.
And, though my temp'rall hopes may be destroid*
Yet, I have those, that never shall be void.
Thus, to the Lord, my soul I powered out,
When I with d^ngers wa^ enclosed about;
And though I was a sinner, this appeased
His wrath in Christ, and my g^iev'd soul was eased*
He graciously accepted, in good part,
This poor oblation of an humbled heart.
His Mercy se^l'd my pardon; and I shook
The Pestilence (which hold upon me took)
From off my shoulder, without sense of harm,
As Paul did shake the Viper from his arm.
That week, moreover, God beg^n to slack
His Bow, and call his bloody Angel back;
Who by degrees retired, as he came on.
For, week by week, until it f^ll to none,
The number which the Pestilence did kill,
Was constantly, and much abated still.
When we were fleating on that Inundation,
At first we sent a carnal Lamentation;
Which like the Raven (from Noah's Arc) did fly,
And found nor rest* nor hope of remedy.
Then sent we D^ve-like Mournings: but th^^^ feet
A while could with no resting places mee^
Then forth again we sent them, out from ^ence
VVing'd with mo^e Charity, and Penitence.
And then, they brought an Olive-b^anch of peace,
Which made us hopeful of this Floods decrease.
The Lord did favor to this Kingdom daigne,
And, brought from thrall, his Jacob, back again.
His peoples crimes he freely did release;
His ir^ abated; his hot rage did cease.
His praise had in our Land a dwelling place;
And Mercy there, with Justice did embrace.
And 'twas a grace to be considered,
That a Disease, so generally spread,
(And so contagious) in few weeks should from
So many thousands, to a cipher come.
That our infectious beds, and rooms, and stuff*
(Which in all likelihood had been enough
To keep the Plague among us, till it had
Our Cities, and our Towns unpeopled made,
Should from their noy^omnesse, so soon be ^r^ed*
Is out of doubt a matter worth our heed.
Yea, it is a Merry (though most mind it not)
Which in this Land should never be forgot:
That from an enemy so dangerous,
So great a City and so populous
Should in three months be purified so,
That all men might with safety, come and go.
For, e're the following Winter was expired,
The Citizens were to their homes retired:
The Term from Reading, was recalled hither,
From every Quarter, Clients came together;
New trading was begun; another brood
Soon filled the houses which unpeopled ^^ood;
Our Gentry, took up their old rendevow;
And such a concourse through our streets did flow,
That every place was filled: and, of all those,
(Those many thousands) who their lives did lose
(But some ^ew mon^hs before) no want was found,
The people every where did so abound.
To thee oh Lord, to thee oh Lord! be praise:
For, thou do wound and cure, strike down and raise
Thou kill'st, and make alive: thou frownst at night,
And, thou art pleased e're the morning light.
When we offend thee, thou a while do leave us*
When we repent, thou do again receive us.
To ruin thou deliver'st us; and then,
R^turne again (thou saift) ye sons of men.
For, in thy wisdom thou considered have*
That man is like a bubble, or a blast:
A heap of Dust, a tuft of withered Grass,
A fading F^owre, that soon away does pass:
A Moment fled, which never shall retire;
Or smoking Flax, that quickly loses fire.
An idle ^reame, which nothing does betoken;
A bruised Reed, which may with ease be broken:
And therefore ^ost in Judgment, Mercy mind,
Yea, in thy greatest anger thou art kind.
As is the space twixt heaven and earth, above,
So large, to those that fear thee, is thy love.
As far ^s does from E^st, the West ^eside,
So f^r thou d^st from us our sins divide.
Such a^ a father to his child does bear,
S^^h love is thine, to those who thee do fear.
T^y Justice thou from ^ge to age declarest;
But, such as love thee, thou for ever sparest.
I thou but turn away from us, thy face,
Lo, we are breath^esse in a moments space.
Thy look does us with life again endue,
And all our losses instantly renew.
As often as we rebel, thou do forgive us;
And though into dist^esse, sometime, thou drive us;
Yet, alwa^es in our sorrows we were eyed,
And thou did please to hear us when we cried.
With t^^rst and hunger faint, some strayed aside,
To seek a place where safe they might abide.
With, worse then bands of iron, they were chained,
And in the gloomy sh^des of Death detained.
With h^^^ and ^ick^esse* they dejected were;
And to deliver them; no help was there.
Their wickedness^ when they were plagued for,
Their souls the sweetest mor^^ls did abhor.
They for their follies, did afflicted lie,
And, to the gates of Death approached nigh.
Their souls within them were nigh dead with fear;
Yea, they distracted, and amazed were.
But, when to thee they called, they were eased,
And out of all their troubles quite released.
Thou sent'st abroad thy Word, and they were healed;
Thy Wr^t of Indignation was repealed
From out of Death's black shades they were reprieved;
And in their sorrows and their pains relieved
From East and West, from North and South, and from
Their several wanderings, thou shall call them home*
In every quarter of the Realm thou soughtst them;
Yea to their City back again thou broughtst them:
And there (now) joy^u^l, and in health they be;
From all their fears, and all their dangers free.
Oh* would that men this love would think upon,
And tell their seed what wonders thou have done:
Would they, Oblations, of thanksgiving, bringing,
Thy works would praise, and publish them, in singing.
Oh! would they were so wise that they might lea^ne
Thine infinite compassion to discern;
And that they would assist me to declare,
How great thy Judgments and thy Mercies are!
Though none can of thy favors make relation,
Nor fully utter all thy commendation;
Yet, let us do our best, that we may raise
A thankful Trophee to thy boundless praise.
Let us, whom thou have saved, thee con^esse.
And to our utmost power t^y goodness bless.
Let us proclaim thy bounties, in the street,
And, preach thee where ou^ Congregations meet.
Let us in private, at noone, morn, and night,
And in all pl^ces, in thy praise delight.
Let Prince, and Priest, and People, old, and young,
The rich, the poor, the feeble, and the strong,
Men, Angels, and all creatures that have name,
Unite their powers, to publish out thy fame.
But, howsoever, others may endevor,
Let me oh! God, let me oh God! persever
To magnify thy glory. Let nor day,
Nor any morn, or evening, pass away,
In which I shall not to remembrance bring
Thy Judgments; and of thy great Mercy, sing.
Let, never whilst I live, my heart forget
Those Dangers, and that strong entangled Net,
In which my soul was hampered. Let me see
(When, in this world, I shall best pleased be)
My dangers such appearing as they were,
When me, they ^ound about enclosed here:
Yea, when, overwhelmed, with terrors, I did call,
Like Jonas, from the belly of the Whale,
And was delivered. Lord, remember thou,
That with unfainednesse, I beg thee, now,
To keep me always mind^ull of thy love.
And, if herea^ter, I forgetful prove;
Let this unfainednesse which thou do give,
An Earnest be, of what I shall receive
In time to come Refresh my cooled zeal,
And let thy Spirit, thy hid Love reveal.
Let nor the fawning World, nor cunning Devil,
Nor wanton Flesh, incite my heart to evil.
Let not my wand^ing eyes, be tempted by
Those Objects that a^lure to Vanity;
Nor let my ears be charmed by their tongues,
Wh^ to betray me, chant out Syren-songs.
Let me nor taste a Pleasure, nor obtain
That carnal Rest, whereof I am so feign*
Till it shall make me plainly to perceive
Thy love* and teach me, foolish paths, to leave.
Let me be still in want; and ever striving
With some affl^ctions (whilst that I am living)
Till they for better Fortunes, better me:
And, then, let into Rest, my entrance be.
From year to year, (as thou have yearly done)
New sorrows, and new trials bring thou on
My stubborn heart, till thou have softened it,
And* made it, for thy service, truly fi^:
Bu^, give me hopes, and daily comforts too,
To strengthen me, as thou have used to do.
And, that, in Justice, Mercy may appear,
Inflict (Oh Lord!) no more then I can bear.
I feel (and tremble that I feel it thus)
My flesh has f^ailties which are dangerous,
To mine own safety: and as soon as thou
Shall quite remove the fears that seize me now;
My sense of thee, and those good thoughts (I doubt)
May fail within me, or be rooted out.
Some L^st may quench them, or some Care may choke them,
Vain ho^^s may veil the^ or new-thoughts revoke the^;
The wisdom of the world, or of the Devil,
Or, some suggestion, in my self, that is evil,
May urge, perhaps, that it is melancholy,
Which fills me no^; that superstitious folly
Begot this awfulnesse; that ^his Disease
Did accid^nt^lly, our C^t^ seize;
And, that it is vain to muse so much upon
Those times or trou^les, that are past and gone.
Oh! rather, then it should in me be so,
Some other house of Sorrow send me to;
And keep me, Lord, perpetual prisoner there,
Till all such dangers overpassed are.
Nor weal nor woe I crave, but part of either,
As with my tem^er best agrees together.
For, joy without ^hy grace, is griefs increasing,
And wealth is poverty, without thy blessing.
But if by passing this life's p^rging fires,
Thou shall so purify my hearts desires,
That without peril to my hopes of heaven,
A temp'rall rest may at the last be given;
Vouchsafe it Lord, even for the good of them
Who my best resolutions, yet, condemn.
Let the^ discern, thou blessings have provided,
For that, which they unjustly have derided.
Thou her^tofo^e did hear thy Servant call,
And made me free when I was close in thrall.
Oh! to those ^o^tals make me not a scorn,
Who to my Sham^ my Glory seek to turn:
But let it in thy time to them appear,
That thou did me e^ect, and me wilt hear.
Let them perceive (though they my Lot disdain)
The promise of this Life does appertain
To me as unto them. And for their sakes
Whose weakness, otherwhile, of^ences takes
At my perpetual scandals; let their eye
Behold the ^urne of my Cap^ivity;
And know tha^ I have walked in a path,
Which, in this life time, some smooth paces has.
B^t, naught repine I, though this boon thou grant not.
For, that which thou to me deny'st I want not.
I know thy Wisdom knows what best will fit me:
I know thy Power enough those things to get me:
I know thy Love is large enough to me:
I know thy Pleasure should my pleasure be:
Thy will be done, and hallowed be thy Name,
Although it be through my perpetual shame.
Whilst on such Meditations I was fe^ding
My pleased soul (and Gods great goodness heeding)
That I might fill her with contemplating
On him, from whom all happiness does spring:
A sudden Rapture did my Muse prepare
For higher things then she did lately dare.
Me thought, I saw Gods Iu^tice and his Love
Installed on one throne in heaven above.
I had imperfect fights, and glimmering notions,
Concerning some of their parti^^lar motions,
About this Orb. I much perceived, me thought,
O those their wondrous works wc they had w^ough^
In former days. And, as within a Glass,
Some things I saw, which they will bring to pass
In future times. By help of Gods great Book,
(Which for my Ephimerides I took)
I had proc^r'd a large intelligence
Of Justice and of Mercies Influence.
There, learned I theseverall Aspects,
And, of those St^ries the several effects:
W^ile in co^juncti^n those two Lights I saw;
The best Alt^o^o^ers could never draw
From all the pl^n^t^ry Constellations
(Even (...) their best) such heavenly consolations.
I co^^d conjectu^e of their wo^ke divine,
In S^xtile, or in Qu^drine, or in Trine;
And what pro^igious Plagues the world should fright
If their asp^ct were wholly Opposite.
Some things, by calculation I discerned,
Which this our British Latitude concerned;
And most of them not much impertinent
For all Mer^dians through Earths Continent.
I saw of Weal and Woe the many ranges:
I saw the restless Wheel of mortal changes:
I saw how Cities, Commonwealths, and Men,
Did rise and fall, and ^ise and fall again.
I saw the reason, why all Times and States,
Have such vicissitudes, and various fates.
I saw what does occasion War, and Peace;
What causes Dearth, and what does bring Increase.
I saw what hardens, and what mollifies;
And whence all Blessings, and all Plagues arise*
I saw how sins are linked in together
As in a Chai^^; how one does cause another;
And how to every link throughout the Chain,
Are fixed those Plagues which to that Crime pertain*
I saw un^eal'd, that hellish Mystery,
Of carnal and mere wor^dly ^olicy,
Whereby the Devil fools this generation,
And brings on Christendom such molestation.
I saw (as plain, as ever I did see
The Sun at none) what damned projects be
Veild over with Piety, and Holy zeal:
And how, a Christian Ath'isme now does steal
Upon this age. Forgive me that I saw
A Christian Ath'isme; for, even to betray
Christ Jesus, Christ and Jesus, those two Names,
Are often usurped; and it us defames.
I saw, why some abuse their holy Calling,
And why so many Stars from heaven are falling.
I had a License given me, to come
Where I might see the Dev^ls Tiring-roome,
And, all the Maskes, the Visards, and Disguises,
Which he to murder, cheat, or rob, devises.
And wears himself, or lends false-hearted brothers
Therewith to fool themselves, or cozen others.
Here lay a Box of zeal prof^ssing Eyes,
Which serve for acting of Hypocrisies.
Hard by, another, full of Double-hearts,
For those who play the Amb^dexters parts.
There, stood a Ch^st of counterfeited Graces;
Another, full of honest-seeming Faces.
Yo^n, hung a suit, which, had some Traitor got,
He might have pass^d for a Patriot.
Close by, were pr^ss^ fuls of such suits, as they
Do wea^e (in every Kingdom at this day)
Who pass for Statesmen; when, God knows, they be
As far from that, as knaves from loving me.
There, hung those masking-suits, in which the Popes,
And Cardinals, pursue their carnal hopes.
There, were those fo^mall Garbs, wherein false friends
Disguise themselves, for some unfaithful ends.
Fair counterfeits for Bishops saw I there,
So like their habits that are most sincere,
(And so be^ainted) that if they were set
Upon the back of our Arch counterfeit,
He could not be distinguished from the best
O^ all those Prelates, that have Christ professed.
There, viewed I all those juggling sleights with which
Men work false miracles; and, so, betwitch
Deluded souls There, saw I all the trick^
And Fa^tosmes wherewithal our Schismatics
Abuse themselves and others. There (with ruth)
I saw false-Doctrines, t^imm'd about with Truth;
Faced out, with Fathers; pee^'d, and neatly dea^ned,
With Sentences, and Sayings, of the Learned.
Yea, with Gods holy Scriptures, interweaved,
So cunningly, as would have nigh deceived
Even hi^ Elect: (and, many a one, alas,
Of these, for Christian Verities does pass.)
I saw moreover, with what Robes of Light,
The King of Darkness does his person dight*
To make it Angel like; and how he scrues
Himself among our musings, to abuse
Our understandings; how he lays his hooks*
And baits, at Sermons, and in godly-books;
(Although the Authors had, in their invention,
A pious meaning, and a good intention)
I saw what venom he does hurl into
Our heert'est prayers, and those works we do
In purest charity: and how he strives
To poison us in our preservatives.
When all these M^skings, and a thousand more,
My apprehensions eye had looked into:
From thence my Con^emplation raised my thought,
And, to a higher Station I was brought.
There, I beheld what ruin and confusion,
Was of these M^mmeries, the sad conclusion.
There, ^aw I what Catastroph^s attend
Those Vanities, wherein ou^ times we spend:
How God still counterworks* and overthrowes
The projects of the Devil, and our Fo^s.
And, tell I could (^ut that it would be prated,
I some Propheti^k spirit arrogated)
Strange news to those m^n^ ears, who have not learned
What nay, by M^litation, be dis^erned*
Yet, all th^^ ^ conce^v^ I cannot write:
Nor would I though I co^ld: for, so I might
Throw Pearls to Swi^n; of whom I may be torn*
Be t^ampled in the m^re, and ma^e a scorn.
Nay, tell m^ self I d^re not, what I spy,
When I have ^^oughts of most transcendency;
Lest Pride possess me, and should cast me down,
As far below, as I on high have flowne:
For, when we nearest unto heaven do so^re,
(Till we are there) our perils are the more;
Since, there is wicked^esse which we do call
The wickedness that is spi^itu^ll
In he^v'nly places And as we do know
The^e is a Light^ing which dot^ oft^n go
Quite thr^ugh the body, to the vital part,
And kill the very spirits at the heart,
Yet never harm the flesh; becau^^ it may
Through v'ry por^us member make it way
Without impr^ssi^n* So, from our offenses,
The Devil does extract some Q^^ntess^^ses*
Which we may rightly nam^, the spirit of (...)*
And, til^ ou^ thoughts have sublimat^d bin,
They a^e too gross for that to work upon.
But, when ^uc^ Sublimations are begun,
He does infuse his ^hym^ca^l receipt,
And, ^ither w^^k^ precipita^^on, st^a^ght,
O^ m^kes those V^^tues, which pure gold were thogh^
When they shall come to trial, worse then naught*
I saw this danger (as my soul did fly
To God ward) and the Devils Chemistry,
I lear^^d how to frust^ate; by assuming
H^mil^^y* and shunning high presuming.
I, of those lovel^ G^ace^, got the view,
Which te^ch us how such peril^ to eschew.
I learned there, how they m^g^t be p^ocured;
How the^ continu^nce might be still secured;
And, in my pow'^ i^ is not to expr^sse,
How I was fi^l'd with h^pes of happiness.
My thoughts (yet) climbed higher and perceive^
A ^l^mpse o^ thin^s ^h^t cannot be ^onc^ived.
The Love of God; the Joys that are ^o come;
And many fights that long were h^dden from
My blinded Soul. This, set my heart ^n fire
To climb a little, and a little high^^;
Till I was up so high, that I did see
The World, but like an Atome, under me.
Me thought, it was not worth my looking on;
Much less, the setting of my love upon.
My soul did strive to mix her self among
The Cherubins, and in their Angell-song
To bear a part; and, secrets to unskreene,
That cannot by our mortal eyes be seen.
And, I would gladly thither have ascended,
Where joys are perfect, and all woes are ended.
As thus I mounted; by degrees I felt
My strength to fail me, and my wings to melt:
My flesh waxt faint; my objects grew too pure,
For my gross understanding to endure.
A kind of shuddring did my heart surprise,
Like that which comes when sudden thoughts arise.
I fared like him, who sleeping, dreams of store,
And waking, finds himself exceeding poor.
A power unseene, did hold upon me take,
And, to my soul, to this effect it spoke.
"I say it was Gods Spirit; if you doubt
"I arrogate, come hear the matter out:
"For, who the Speaker is, that will disclose:
"And, if 'twere he, his Flock, his language knows.
Despair not Soul (it said) though thou art feign
To sink from these, to common thoughts again.
Nor murmur thou, that yet thou must not rise
To thy wished height. God's favo^r will suffice
For that which wants; and these high thoughts are given
In earnest of chat part of thine in heaven,
Which by t^y Royal Master is prepared;
And, in thy time allotted, shall be shared.
St^ive to ascend; but strain not over long,
Thy cl^mbing spirits, lest thou do them wrong.
The Flesh is heavy, though the Soul be light*
And, Heaven is seldom reached at one flight.
Mount high; but, mount not higher then thy bound;
Lest thou be loft, and all that thou have found.
Search deep; but search no deeper then thy power;
Lest some infernal Depth may thee devour.
Obse^ve thy Makers glory by reflection;
But, gaze not overmuch at his perfection;
Lest that great luster blind thee. Take thou heed,
Lest while thou think thou homeward do proceed,
Thou quite be loft: For, though these flights do raise
Thy Soul with pleasure, they are dangerous waye^.
When higher then the vulgar pitch she towers
She meets with Principalities, and Powers,
Who wrestle with her, that she may not rise*
Or tempt her on, by Curiosities,
To lead the mind astray, until it wanders
Among the windings of unsafe Meanders.
Then does it whirle about, to see things hidden;
Pryes after Secresies that are forbidden;
And by a path, which tends to Heaven, in show,
Ariveth, unaware, at Hell below.
Take heedof this* the way to heaven is steep;
Yet, e're thou climb it, thou must often creep.
The work appointed thee, is yet unended,
And, Gods good pleasure must be still attended
Even in this world, until he cal^ thee thence.
His Kingdom must be got by vi^lence.
Thou must with many frailties, yet, contend,
Before thy Christian warfare has an end.
The World is brewing yet another Cup
Of Bitterness, for thee to swallow up.
Thou have from Heaven an Arrand yet to do,
Which (if God hinder not) will call thee to
More troubles, and more hatred bring upon thee,
Then all thy former Messages have won thee.
And be thou sure, the Devil will devise
Al^ sl^nders, and all wicked infamies
That may dispa^age thee: or ^ruitlesse make,
That use ^ll wo^ke which thou do unde^take.
Thou must prepare t^ine ears to ^eare the noise*
Of causeless thre^tnings, or the foolish voic^
Of ignor^nt ^epr^vers* and expect
The secret C^^sures of ea^h g^ddy Sect.
Thou must provide thy self, to hea^e great Lords
Talk, without ^eason, big impe^ious wo^ds.
Thou must contented be to make repai^e
(If need require) before the Scorn^rs Chair,
To hear t^em jeere, and flout, and take in hand
To scoff at what ^hey do^ not understand.
Or say, perhaps, that of t^y self thou make
Some goodly thing; or that thou undertak'st
Above thy Calling; or u^warranted:
Not heeding from who^e mouth it has bin sed,
"Gods Wisdom often elects, what m^n despise;
"And foolish things, to fool the worldly wise.
But ^ea^e thou not. For, he that in all places,
And from all dangers, wants, and all disgraces,
Has hi^herto preserved the^; will secure
Thy safety now. That hand which did procure
Release from thy clo^e Thraldomes, and maintained
Thy heart content, while thou went so restrained;
Will be the same for ever: and, like stubble,
Consume; or, like the weakest water-bubbl^.
Dissolve the force of every machination*
Whereby the world shall seek thy molestation.
Thoug^ thou in knowledge ar^ a Child, as yet;
And, seem not by outward Calling fi^
For such a task: yet, do not thou disable
What God shall please to say is warrantable.
His Word, remains s^ill in date, which says,
That, On the children of the later days,
He would pour out a measure of his Spirit;
And, thou the^eof a portion shall inherit.
Though thou d^spised art; yet God by thee
Shall bring to pass a work which strange will be
To most beholders; and, no doubt, it shall
Occasion some to stand, and some to fall.
For, men to ruin doomed, will misconceive it;
And, they that shall have safety, will receive it.
Thy God ha^h touched thy Tongue, and tipped thy Pen;
And, t^erefore, fear not thou the face of men,
Lest ^e destroy thee. For, this day to stand
Against Princes, Priests, and People of this Land,
Thou a^t appointed: and they shall in vain
Contend. For, thou the conquest shall obtain.
Al^hough that viperous Brood upon thee lights,
Whose pois'ned tongue with killing slander smites;
And, though the ba^barous People of this I Will,
Do thereupon adjudge thee, for a while,
A man so wicked* that (although thou have
The Sea of Troubles, without ship wrack, past)
Gods Vengeance will not suffer thee to live
The life of honest Fame: Let that not grieve
Thy heart a whit. F^r, though their eyes do see
Reproaches, which like Vipers, hanging be,
Upon thy flesh; they shall perceive e're long,
That thou (unharmed) them away have flung.
And they who did exp^ct to see thee fall,
For thy firm standing, p^aise Gods mercy shall.
Against oppression, he will ^afe maintain thee,
Even God, who often did his protection daigne thee;
And took thy part against all those, that sought
How they thy Muse, to silence, might have brought.
He, that preserved thee from this plague, will save thee:
For, he thy life even of mere mercy, gave thee,
To serve him with Thou know thou art a Brand,
Snatched from the flaming fire, by Gods own hand;
And that to him thou owe, all thou art,
And all thy Faculties, in ev'^y part.
Take heed, therefore, that nothing thou refuse
To utter, which he prompts unto thy Muse.
Be constant: and, Elihu-like, beware
That thou accept not persons; nor declare
With glozing ^i^les, that which thou shall say;
Left God may take thee suddenly away:
But, publish that which he of thee requires,
In terms, and words, as he the same inspires.
For, to this Realm and City thou art sent,
To warn, that of their follies they repent;
To show for what omissions, and offenses,
God sends Famines, Wars, and Pestilences;
And to pronounce what other plagues will come,
If their Transgressions they depart not from.
Indeed, of Priests and Prophets, store have they,
And, some of them are like enough to s^y;
When came the Spirit of the Lord to thee,
From us, who no such dangers can foresee
As thou pretendest? These are they that share
The pleasures of the time, with such as are
The Lands perdition. These are they which tie
Soft pillowes to men's elbowes; and still cry
Peace, peace; even when perd^tion, hanging over
The peoples heads, they plainly may discover.
But, they that are true Priests of God among them,
And his true Prophets, think not, he does wrong the^,
If he do choose a Heardman: nor will such
^nvy the same (or at the blessing grutch)
I^ all were Prophets, and God pleased were
To make that Gift to every man appear.
Though Gods own presence, had made Moses wise;
Yet. Iethro's counsel would he not despise.
He, whom the Angel fed, did also eat
Even when the Ravers came to bring him meat:
And, all that of their spirit partners be,
Will hear what is good, though published by thee.
Behold; this thanklesse People (from whose Land
God has but newly took his heavy hand)
Forget already what his mercy has
Vouchsafed; and his late enflamed wrath.
S^e, how they flock together, to pursue
New mis^hiefes, and old follies to renew.
Their evil courses, they afresh begin;
And, even those very purposes of sin,
Whose p^osecution this great Plague has staid,
To finish now they are no whit afraid.
Those Discords which they, many times, pretended,
Amid their fears, should christian^y be ended,
(If God would spare them) are again revived;
And diverse new malicious plots contrived.
Those Lusts, of which they seemed much ashamed;
Those Vanities, for w^^ch themselves they blamed;
Those Bargains, which their conscience did persuade
Were wicked; and o^ ^od abhorred made them; (the^,
That Pride; that Slo^^; that Envy; that Excess;
That C^uelty; that I^religiousnesse;
Yea, all that wickedness pur^ude before,
(And which they fai^^^ so truly to deplore)
Returns with intere^t; and they contemn
Good things; as if the Plague had hardened them.
Like Phar'oh, they repented while the Rod
Was laid upon them. But, as soon as God
Removed it; their minds they changed too;
And would not let their evil customs go.
Go therefore instantly, go draw the Map
Of that great Plague from which they did eseape:
Set thou before their eyes, as in a glass,
How great Gods Mercy, and their danger was.
Lay open their gross crimes, that they may see
How hateful, and how infinite they be.
Declare what mischiefs their enormities
Have caused; and will daily cause to rise.
Pronounce those Judgments which Gods holy Word
Does for the Wages of their Crimes record.
And (as the blessed Spirit shall enable,
Thy Muse; and, show thee what is warrantable)
Tell boldly, what will on their ways attend,
Unless their lives and courses they ^mend.
D^lay it not; and let no work of thine;
No goodly-seeming hope, or fair design,
(How promising soeve^) draw thee from
This Task, until unto an end it come.
For, no affair of thine shall find success,
Till thou have finished this great Business.
If any man that is thy friend, or foe,
Shall this deride; and say it is not so;
But, that thy Fancy only eggeth on
Thy Muse: or, that to do, or leave undone
This work, were much alike. If any ^ay
Thou may proceed herein, with such delay,
As, vulgarly, dis^retion thinks fit:
Or, as thy common Business will permit.
Nay, if thou meet, as thou may me^t with some,
Who like a Prophet, unto thee will come;
And (as the Man of G^d seduced was,
Who told in Bethel what should come to pass
Concerning Ieroboams Altar there)
Persuading thee, those thoughts delusions are:
That, self-conceit, or pride, has made thee dream
That thou art bound to prosecute this Theme:
Believe them not. For, if that Man of God
Here mentioned, did feel so sha^pe a rod,
When his delay was but to eat and drink;
(Perchance through hunger) and when he did think
A Prophet sent by God, had licensed him:
Take heed thou do not this advice contemn.
For, since this motion urges naught that is ill,
Nor contradicts Gods revealed will;
But rather helps effect it: since he moves it
So nat'rally, that thine own soul approves it
To be his act; beware how thou suspect it,
Or how thou shall be careless to effect it.
Let not a worldly wisdom, (nor the scoff
Of any) from this motive drive thee off.
Take heed the fear of dangers, not the loss
Of carnal hopes, thy purpose, herein, cross.
Take heed, that Ionas-l^ke, thou be not bent
To Tharsus* when thou know that thou art sent
To Niniveh. For, all thy doubts, and fear,
Will be as causeless, as his doubtings were:
And be thou sure, that wheresoever thou be,
A Tempest and a Whale shall follow thee.
My heart received this Message; did allow
It came from God; and made a solemn Vow*
It would not entertain a serious thought
Of any worldly thing, till that were brought
To full perfection: no, although it might
Endanger losing my best fortune quite.
But, oh I how frail is Man? and how unable
In any goodness to continue stable?
How subtle is the Devil? and what b^its,
And undermining policies and sleights,
Has he to coozen us? My soul was raised
So high, e'rewhile, that I admired and praised
My blessed estate: And thought, with D^vid, then,
My heart shall never be r^mov'd age^.
But, see, how soon, if God withdraw his eye*
We fall to hell, that up to heav^n did fly.
I would have sworn (when in my Con^emplation,
I was ascended to that lofty Station,
So lately mentioned) that I should h^ve scorned
The goodl'est prize the Devil could have subo^n'd
To tempt me by. I thought, if God had said,
Do this; that (though the World had all been laid
To be my wages, if I should delay
The doing of the same* but half a day)
(...) ^^ve rather cho^e to have forsaken
My life: then so to have been overtaken.
Yet, lo^; so craftily a bait was laid;
S^^h shows of Goo^nesse* thereinto convaid*
(...) means of hel^e to Piety, pretended;
^o me so seemed it, to be re^ommended
By God himself; and, such necessity
App^ar'd of taking opportunity
As th^n it off^ed was, that I suspected
I had ^one ill, the same to have neglected.
N^y, to my Understanding, true Disc^etion,
And, all the Wisdom of this Generation,
Did ^o concur together to betray
My h^a^t; that I did foolishly delay
The Tas^ enjoyed. Yea, what I had bgun,
(Proceed^d in) and pu^pos'd should be do^^
Before my best affairs; even that I threw
Aside; and other hopes I did pursue.
I brake my Vow, and I was led awry
For that which was more light then Vanity;
And so my hopes my judgment did beguil^,
That, I supposed all was well the while.
Most, also, th^ught me wi^ely to have done,
And, ^uch a fortune to have lighted on;
That o^h^rs, of my happiness, began
To talk; and reckon me a prosp^rous man.
But, many scandals, passions, and vexations,
Much hindrance, and a wo^ld of perturba^ions,
Pursued me; to let me unde^stand,
That I had taken some wrong ^ct in hand.
For, though like Jonas, I resolved not quite
From Gods commands to make a stubbo^ne slight;
Yet w^nt I to his Work the fu^thest way*
And, traveled, as mine own occasions lay.
Which he perceiving, s^nt a Storm that c^est me;
Mad^ shipwreck of my hopes; my labou^ les^ me;
Bef^ol'd my wisdom^; of ^uch joy bere^t me;
Within the Sea of many troubles lest me;
And, what with speed and ease I ^ight have done
At first* has long with pain been lingered on.
Yea, when the Ha^v^st of my great r^pute
Was looked for (and most expected fruit)
It proved chafe; and, plainly I perceived,
That God had suffered me to be d^ceived;
To warn me, that hereafter, I should never*
Omit, for any reason what^oever,
His motions; nor with holy vows d^spense:
B^t work his pl^^sure, with all diligence.
Which after I had heeded, I descried
By what, and whither, I was drawn aside*
I plainly saw, that what I then had sought
With hope of comfort, would my woe have wrough^*
I f^und that likely to have been to me
A Curse, which promised my Bliss to be.
I prai^ed God, as for a savor done,
That he did lose m^, what I might have won:
And what the world did think me hapl^sse in,
I ^ound a gracious blessing to have bin.
I s^w my fault; I saw, in vain I sought
To work my will, till ^ Gods will had wrought.
I saw that while the furthest way I went,
Gods Mercy did my foolishness prevent:
Yea, made it (by his providence divine)
A great advantage to his own Design.
And, for my negligence when I had mourned,
To my propos^d Labor, I r^turned.
I begged of God that he would give me grace,
To be more constant in a godly race.
I did beseech him to bestow again
Those Apprehensions, which my hopes in vain
Had made me lose: and that, for my demerit*
He would not q^ench in me his holy Spirit:
But, gran^ me power to prosecute my story,
And utter forth his Message, to his ^lory.
My su^e was heard: I got wh^t I desired:
My soul, with m^tter, was anew inspired.
M^ eyes were cleared; my heart was new enlarged:
Bold Resolu^ions h^d all F^ares discharged:
And, that which was d^sclosed unto me,
Does appertain, Great Britain, unto the^*
Come hear me therefore; for, however thou t^ke it*
My Conscience bids me, and I mean to speak it.
Within thy power thou have me; and what e're
Shall good and right in thine own ey^s appear,
Thou may inflict upon me: But, this kn^w,
That what I shall declare, God bids me show;
And that, if I for this, have harm, or shame;
My God shall at thy hands require the sam^.
Oh! let not my requests in vain be made;
Nor to thy former sins, another add.
And, my sweet Country, and dear Co^ntrimen,
Let not these overflowings of my pen
Distasteful be; as if their spring had been*
But either from the Gall, or from the Spleen.
Let not this ages false Int^rpr^ter,
(Which makes both Judgment and Affection err)
Corrupt my Text, by their false Commentary,
To make your good opinions to miscary.
For, though in me (as in all flesh and blood)
Much error hinders from that perfect good
Which I ^ffect: yet I his meed may claim,
Who makes Gods glory, and your weal his aim;
And, begs but of his words a pa^ient hearing;
And, from your follies a discreet forbea^ing.
If there be Truth, and Reason, in the M^ss^ge,
Let not my person hinder my Ambass^ge.
If God shall in his Mercy pleased be,
To make a Factor for his praise of me;
Let none the poorness of my gifts de^ide,
Since he to no ^xternall means is tied.
Despise not what I speak, for what I am;
Unless you find the mat^er be to blame.
For, God by Babes and Sucklings, often, reve^l^s,
What from the wisest worldlings he conceales.
Both Heaven and Earth, to witness here I c^ll,
I dared not speak what now I utter shall,
Unless I thought, that God did me inspire;
And would this duty at my hands require.
Nor dared I to be silent, though I kn^w
That every m^n had vowed ^o pursue
My So^le to Death; because m^ conscience takes
A^kn^wl^dgement, that God w^thin me speaks.
I do not this, for that I se^selesse am,
(Oh! Englan^) of thy infamy or shame:
For, thy dishonor does concern me nearly;
And thee my he^rt affect^th far more dearly,
Then cow^rds do their lives. I would dist^ll
My blood (as ink is drained from my quill)
Even drop by drop; or else, at once, le^ all
Gush forth, to save thy honor from a fall.
I aim not at a vain or fruitless glory,
B^ d^ring: for, I know the mortal story
Of all the glorioust actions, that are under
The heavens large curt^in, are but nine days wo^^er.
And that the most deserving works we do,
May ruin^ us, and help disgrace us too.
I do it not that I may wealthy grow:
For, I the worlds rewards already know
^n such attempts. Experience I have g^ined,
What poor preferments this way are ob^ained.
My former Strain^s (which did but way prepare
For that, which I hereaft^r should declare)
R^ceived evermore the worst reward,
As they grew better worthy of regard.
A^^ (if God let not) as these are my best,
M^ troubles, will for them, exceed the rest.
It Is odds, but that the wilful Generation,
F^^ who^ I write this large Anticipation,
(^o stay their censur^) will scarce read so f^r,
A^ hitherto, where th^se Preventions are:
B^t, here, and there, pick out some tart relations,
W^^hout observing of those moderations
That follow or precede them. Else, perchance
Their brazen and Herculcan Ignorance
Will strongly keep that Understanding from them,
Whereby the power of Reason might overcome them.
Some also, peradventur^, will ^orget,
How, when I formerly was round beset
With many troubles, I did still despise
The r^ging fury of mine enemies.
Yea some, no doubt, will have a mind to see
What kind of power, there is in them, or me;
And whilst such men there are, he thinks amiss,
Who thinks to thrive by such a course as this.
It Is not from envy of their Lot, who grow
Great men, or wealthy, whence these lines do flow*
For, I rejoi^e in each man's happiness,
That to Go^s praise, good fortunes does poss^sse:
And they that know my person, witness can,
My looks assure, I am no envious man.
It i^ not malice that has wrought upon
My Passi^ns: for, I vow, I malice none.
No line or word of this which now I write,
Proceeds from r^ncor, or unchristian spite.
When I have wrong received, if I say
Wher^in; what harm do I in that I p^ay?
'Twere much if when we inju^y susta^ne,
We neither may have help, nor ye^ complain.
'Twere hard, if knowing I had many foes,
I might not say so, lest some should suppose
What Names they bear. To no man this will show the^,
But, unto ^uch as do already know them.
Nor* when I mention wrongs, do I intend
Their shame who do them; but some better end.
For, they that yet are enemies of mine,
May prove Go^s friends, and to my good incline.
I wis^ them well, what e're they wish to me;
And of their harm^ wou^d no procurer be.
In general terms, I point out those that orre;
With none I meddle in particular:
For, knaves and honest men a^e so alike,
In many things, that I amiss may strike.
I find the faults; let others find the men.
I no man judge; let no man judge me then.
My M^se ^ath not usurped this Commission:
No^ arrogateth to mine own condition,
More excellence then others: But, I shar^
A part in those rep^oofes that others b^a^e.
I do not think mine own a spotless eye,
Because it faults in others can ^spye.
I never thought it was enough for me,
A Critic in my neighbors faults to be,
Unless I m^rkt mine own: which here I do*
And ch^ck the wo^lds and m^n^ own errors too.
I mean t^ wink at n^n^; at none I aim;
To heed or friend^ or foes* I do disclaim.
My Bow i^ bent, and I must sho^t a flight*
Of shafts, that will ^n d^ver^ places light.
Perhaps some o^ them my best friends may wound*
Upon my self, some o^he^s may rebound.
S^^e (shot alo^t) may ^^ar the Kites that fly
Above the clouds, themselves to Eaglifie.
Some p^er^e t^e^r s^des, who thought they had bin got
B^^ond the re^ching of my winge^ shot.
A^^ some who thou^ht they h^d concealed been,
May fe^le my ar^ow^^, wh^re they lurk unseene.
Ligh^ w^ere they w^ll the car^'s already took:
Si^c^ none but he tha^'s guilty can b^ struck.
Hist thou fo^got, oh! Britain^, (and so soon)
^hy lates afflictions, and Gods graci^us boon?
As soon as e're thy neck unflacked feels
The curbing Reine, do thou let fly thy heels?
Shall nor Gods Iustic^, nor his matchless Love*
Thy flinty nature to repentance move?
But will thou still in crooked paths persever,
And of thy Vanities repent thee never?
Oh! look about thee; yea, look back, and see
What wondrous things thy God has done for thee.
Thou were in future times, an uncouth place*
That had of wildness the deformed face.
Thou were long time, the seat of Desolation,
And when thou had^t but slender reputation,
God looked upon thee, with the first of all
Those Gentiles, whom in mercy he did call.
Of his beloved Vineyards, thou were one;
And s^^uate like that, once placed upon
The fruitfulst Hill. God, for thy Fence prepared
A natural wall, by ^is own hands uprear^d.
He took away that stony heartedness,
Which did thy heathnish children first possess;
And has been pleased, many times, since th^n,
To gather out those flinty hearted men,
Who by a bloody persecuting hand,
Did harm thy tender Sapling^ in thy Land.
He plucked out of thee the stinki^g weeds
Of Sin and Superst^tion; that the seeds
Of Truth and Hol^ne^se might here be sown,
Where wickedness the so^le had overgrowne.
The choicest Plants (of that Vine-mys^icall,
His onely-Sonne) he planted thee withal.
The stately Watch tower of his Providence
Completely furnished, for thy defense,
In thee was builded up; and did appear
To many other Kingdoms, far and near:
And on the lofty Turrets of the same
He set his Flags, and Ensigns of his Name,
Whose beauteous Colors being wide displaid,
Did make thy adversaries all afraid.
Within thy Borders, has his Love divine
The Wine Press, of a Christian discipline
Erected; and in every season given
(To make thee fruitful) dewes and showrs from heaven.
Yea thou have had, since food of life grew scanty,
Not barely seven, but seventy years of plenty.
What grace soever might repeated be
That God for Israel did, he did for thee.
He from a thraldom, worse then they sustained,
While in the Egyptian bond^ge they remain^d,
Did bring thy Children thorough Baptismes Flood,
And drown thy Fo^s, within a Sea of Blood.
Thy Coast unto a large extent he stretches,
For, even from Sea to Sea it compass fetches*
Thy Land with Milk and Honey over-flowes.
In thee all pleasure, and all plenty grows.
God kept thee as the apple of an eye;
And, as when Eglets are first taught to fly,
Their Dam about them hovers; so, thy God,
Does over thee, display his wings abroad.
A Land of Hills and Dales thou were created;
And in a Clime, so pro^itable, seated,
That whereas many other Lands are feign
To water all their seeds, and plants, with pain,
Thou fav'st that labor: for, the Dewes yield matter
To ch^ere thy Gardens, and the Clouds bring water.
Fair Woods and Groves, do yet adorn thy Mountain^;
Thou a^t a Land of Rivers, and of^ ountaines:
Springs hot and cold, and fresh, and salt, there be*
And, some that cure diseased folk in thee.
Thee, both in Town and Field, the Lord has blessed;
Thy People and thy Cattle are encreast.
Blessed were thou in thy going forth to war;
And blessed also thy returnings were.
He blessed thee in thy store, and in thy basket:
Thine own request he gave, when thou did ask it:
He evermore has timely favors done thee:
Throughout the year his eye has been upon thee:
He careful was, what perils might betide thee;
And heedfull all things needful to provide thee:
In Grass, and Corn, and Fruits, thou do excel:
Thy Horse are strong, thine Oxen labor well:
The udders of thy Kine grow large with milk:
Thy Sheep yield fleeces, like the Persian silk:
Thy Stones are Iron, and ^hy Hills are big
With Minerals, which from their wombs we dig:
Thy Soil is neither over moist, nor dry:
The Sun n^r keeps too far nor comes too nigh:
Thy Air does few contag^ous vapors breed:
Nor does it, often, in heat, or cold exceed.
Still, for thy sins, thou had thy due corrections;
And, foundst compassion in thy great afflictions.
His Prophets and his Preachers God has sent
In every age, to move thee to repent;
And, them thou smot'st, and murtherd'st, now and the^;
Yet, gave he not to other Hu^bandmen
His wronged Vineyard: but, does yet a^tend,
In expectation, when thou will amend.
He, over all thy Foes, the conquest gave thee:
He did from wrong, by neighboring Nations, save thee:
And, they to fear and honor thee were moved,
Because they saw thee, of thy God, beloved.
Thou had a Deborah bestowed upon thee,
Who freed thee from thy Foes, and glory won thee,
In spite of Sisera: For, God did please
To make the Stars, the Clouds, the Winds, and Se^s,
To fight thy batt^ls. When her turn was gone.
He raised up another Solomon,
With^n thy Borders to ^stablish peace,
Who to thy glories added an increase.
Thou were as often warned, and punished;
As much besought; as largely promised,
As Judah was. Thy Church that lately seemed
Like barren Hannah (and was disesteemed
Of proud Peninnah) in a spiritual breed,
Does most of Syons Daughters, now exceed:
And thou have viewed many of thy sons,
To sit and govern, on earths glorious Thrones.
The Jewish Commonw^alth was never daigned
More great Deliverances then thou have gained.
Nor was their help vouchsafed in better season;
As Eighty eight, and our great Powder-^reason,
Can witness well. For, then thy preservation
Was wrought by God (to all men's admi^ation)
Even when Hels Jaws, on thee, were like to ^lose;
And when, for humane aid to interpose,
There scarce was means, or time. All which was done
That thou Gods love might think the more upon.
Moreover, that no means might pass un^ride,
Which God did for the Jews of old provide;
To thee he also sends his only Son:
Not, as to them, a poor con^emned one,
(That, seeing him, they might not him perceive,
And hea^ing him, no knowledge of him have)
Not as a weakling, or illi^e^a^e:
Or mean, or in a persecuted ^late:
Or one whose person, beauty, and ^^mpl^xion,
In them, had nothing stirring up affection;
Nor as a man that worthy seemed of scorn,
Of mocks, of whips, and of a crown of tho^ne:
He came not so to thee for, thou had ^hen
Despised and crucified him again,
As well as they: yea, thou perchance, had more
Despighted him, then others heretofore.
But, in a glorious wise to thee he came:
With power, with approb^tion, and with fame.
His Fishermen (that heretofore did seem
To Jews and Gentiles, of so mean esteem)
Had won whole Count^ies from Idol^try,
And made them to confess his sov'raignty*
He comes to thee with honor, like a King:
He did into (the Church) his Kingdom, bring
A settled Government. He had assw^ged
That Jewish and that Ethnic spite, which raged
At his first coming. Emperors became
His Viceroyes; and did govern in his Nam^.
Thou sawst fulfilled, many things (of old)
Both by his Pr^phets and Himself, foretold;
Which did confirm him, that Messiah, whom
Thou should receive. His Doctrines well become
His purity: and, witnessed is he
By Martyrs and Confessors, him to be
Whom thou should hear. And (this has greater made
Thy Favors, then that Grace the Jews have had)
Their threats, their punishments, their ignorances,
Their pe^tinacy, and deliverances,
Their fallings, risings, and relapses, are
Recorded, that by them thou might beware.
Thou know what Desolation they are in,
In recompense of their despightfull s^n,
The murder of their Brother: yea, like Cain,
Thou see, that, yet, they vagabonds remain.
Thou hear'st, their fruitful Land has ever since,
Been cur^ with barrenness, for their offense:
That, without King, Priest, Prophet, or good order,
They through the wo^ld have wandered for their murder
Nigh sixteen hundred years: and that al^ho
They be abhorred, wheresoever they go,
They have upon them, still, the mark of Caine,
Which will prevent their being wh^lly stain;
Lest (as the blessed Psalmist has foretold)
The People of the Lord* forget it should.
Yet, nor their good Examples* nor their Fall,
Nor all their Blessings, nor their Sorrow^s all,
Have bettered thee: but, thou continu'st in
Their obstinacies, and in all their s^n.
Like them thou murmur'st, if God, but to try thee,
Some blessing, for a little time deny thee,
So, thou do wanton it, as soon as e're,
In any suffering, he thy voice does hear^.
So, thou Gods wholesome counsel do despise,
To follow thi^e own foolish Policies.
So, thou do mix thy self with other N^tions,
And, learn to practice their abominations.
So, on those broken Reeds thou do rely,
Which will deceive, in thy necessity.
So, thou do stop thine cares (to thine own harm)
Although the Charmer never so wisely charm.
That which thy Prophets teach, and well advise;
Just so, thou do neglect; just so, despise:
Yea, though from time to time, thou see the path
Which ^hou do follow, ill successes has:
Though thou have found, that they who did fore^ell
Thy course was foolish, did forewarne thee well:
Though thou do find, no rest, nor peace, in that,
Which thou art yet unwisely aiming at:
And, though thy truest Lovers, every day,
Do counsel thee, and for thy safety pray;
Thou runn^st headlong, still, thy wilful course,
And vaxest every moment, worse and worse.
Thy eyes are blinded, and thou can not see;
Thy heart is hard, and will not softened be.
To thy best Friends thou shewst thy self a Foe,
As if, thou rip'ned were, for overthrow:
And, till God please to turn thy heart again,
All, that speak truth to thee, shall speak in vain.
Whence do thy troubles, and thy losses come,
But, from thy carnal policies, and from
Thine own vain projects, which thou do pursue,
By courses, that will still thy cares renew?
What gain thy children, by their of^ alliance
With Babels issue, or by their affiance,
But mungrell offsprings; which will ready be,
To stir up everlasting strifes in thee?
Though thou have heard, the Midianites do give
Their daughters to no end, but to deceive;
And that the people who to Moloch pray,
Will for their Idol, cast their sons away:
Though thou have heard what plagues ensued upon
The wivings of the wise King Solomon;
And know that by God, forbid it was,
A Bullock should be yoaked with an Ass:
Though thou have seen that their ^ffiniti^s
Are even, among themselves, poor slender ties;
And such as they do naught at all respect,
Unless they serve their p^ojects to ^ffect:
Yet, in their course, thy Children do proceed,
And sow Gods Garden with a mixed s^ed:
O^ which, unless they t^uly do repent,
And s^eke, by carefell tillage to prevent,
What may ensue thereon (as yet they may)
Thy Land will suffer for it, another day.
T^y Guiltiness (oh! Britain) makes thee fear,
And often troubled where no terrors are.
Thy faith has failed thee, and thou did not see
Those armies, which have round encl^sed thee
For thy protection. For, had they been heeded,
Thou no Egyptian succors should have needed.
If thou coul^'^t walk within a constant p^th,
This Island should not fear Iberi^'s wrath.
It should be needless for thee, to pro^ure
Alliances, that cannot long ^ndure.
Thou should not care (but, as they Christian^ be)
What Kings on earth, were friends, or foes to thee.
No power abroad, should make thy children tremble;
Nor homebred faction cause thee to dissemble:
But, being safe in God, thou should contemn
The greatest dangers, and get praise by them*
Oh! call to mind, the times now past away*
Those, which our Fathers, yet, remember may;
And let thine Elders tell thee (for they know)
How strong in Gods protection thou did grow.
What ^antedst thou, when thou went all alone?
When thou had nothing to rely upon,
But Gods mere mercy? and such grace bestowne,
That thou could use those powers that were thine own?
When blessed Eliza wore but half thy Crown,
And, almost all the world, on her did frown;
When Romes proud Bishop; and, of Christendom
The pow'^fulst Monarck, did her foes become.
When ^he had no Alliance, to make strong
Her party: but, wa^ hateful grown, among
The neighboring Princes; for her casting by
The yoke of ^abylonish tyranny.
When she within her Kingdom had a swarm
Of Hornets, which did howrly threaten harm
Both to her State and person. When their pow'^
And fury, w^^ more likely to devour,
Then at this present it appears to be.
When her own Court from traitors was not free,
When she had Irish Rebels to co^rect;
Opp^essed Netherlanders to protect;
And France to umpire in: even when all these,
And other troubles did her State disease.
What glory, wealth, and safety ha^^ t^ou got,
That she, amid those d^ngers, purchased no^?
Religion in her days did still en^re^se;
At home she had both plentiousne^se and peace;
Abroad, ^he was renow^'d: she did not paus^
In execut^ng o^ her whol^^ome Laws,
Through fear o^ any Malcontents at home;
Or any threatenings from the Sea of Rome.
She triple Geri^ns forces did con^emne;
Her neighbors sought her aid; she sought not the^.
She awed the West: she from the Sp^nish Coast
Did rend their golden-fl^eces; and she crossed
Their hopefull'st aims. They could not unde^mine
He^ Counsels; nor by any slye design,
Defea^ her Forces: Fr^nce was prudent then,
And would not stir the w^ath of En^lish^e^:
For, they p^eserv'd their honor, by pr^serving
Their trust in God; and coastan p^^hs observin^.
Then, to affront us, did no D^^chman dare,
Nor, in ou^ Voyages presume to sh^re,
But, with our favor. We had ^ame by land;
O^r powerful Navies did the Seas command.
To ours, the strongest Fleets did strike their sails;
They, that now bark; then, d^r'd not w^g their tails*
Yea, though our Lions not so many were,
Our strongest For, to ^ouze them, sto^d in fear.
No son of thine presumed, then, to be
So trai^erous unto thy God, and thee,
As to allow a popish Liberty:
Much less to move, ^or that impiety,
In public hearing. No man sought to sell,
For any sum, the peace of Israel:
No no^ within ou^ Ir^sh ^onfin^s; tho
It somewhat urgent seemed to have it so:
Because that peace^^ll power thou had not got,
Which now thou have: nor, then, the neighboring Scot
So firm unto thy State; nor so engaged
To tame that Nation, if a war it waged.
Thy Patriots perc^iv'd, that to begin
With Ireland, would become the means to win
Great Britain to the Romish yoke anew;
And, give the Spaniard courage, to pursue
His great design upon the British nations.
They saw what civil broils their Tolerations
Have bred in France. For, if within her womb,
Rebecca could not but diseased ^ecome,
(Whilst she, at once, two sons did nourish there,
Which Fathers of unlike Religions were)
They ^hought, that if one Kingdom should admit
Two such Concepti^ns, to grow ^ipe in it,
They ^ould, by daily struggling with each other,
Afflict the body o^ their nat'ral^ Mother;
And, cause an endless Warfare, until one
Were settled in possession, all alone.
Thou did not then, within t^y Bounds afford
An Altar b^th to Baal* and to the Lord.
What thou resolv'dst, was put in execution;
Thy zeal was chilled with no irresolution.
No haltings were appa^a^^. No disunion
Did hazard (though it troubled) thy Communion:
And, though thy many follies brought afflictions,
(Which, of those errors, were the due corrections)
Yet, was thy faith in God, l^sse violated:
Apparent evils not so p^lliated:
Propha^enesse, not so patronized, as now:
Nor did thou such impieties allow.
But, thou art changed from what once thou w^r^;
Thy worse has ouercom^ thy better part.
Upon thin^ own distempe^s thou art ^ost:
Thy confidence in God is almost l^st.
And, thence it comes, that though thou do ab^und
In many blessings* thou art needy found.
This makes Transgressions to increase upon thee;
They bring new troubles, and new dangers on thee;
These make thee fear; thy terror causes thee
Impatient of thy feared harms to be:
Impatience makes thee so unfit to stay
Gods l^asure; that, thou ru^n'st another way,
And seek'st for help in thine own Fantasies,
In fleshly Leagues, and humane Policies.
Those courses overwhelme thee with new sins:
From them, another b^ood of Pl^gues begins,
Whi^^ does not mollify, but more obdure
Thy ^linty breast: and will at last p^ocure
Thy to^all overthrow; unless thou climb
The hill of hea^ty Penitence, in time.
Grown fat with case, and wealth, thou have forsook
Thy God; and many crooked courses took.
God, who did thee so love, and so esteem;
Who did create thee, and thy life redeem;
Thou have fo^gotten: yea, r^jected him,
And, sought those gods, thy Father did contemn
His Counsels, and his law, thou have despised;
Na^, unto Devi^ls, thou has^ sac^ificed;
And, them and t^ine own ^ust^, preferred before
His honor, whom ^hou shou^dst have prized more.
The corn, and oil^ and wine which thou enjoyedst
As tokens of his love, thou mis^imployedst.
The jewel^ he vouchsa^ed to adorn thee,
(For his own pleasure) thou on those that scorn thee
Bestowst agai^e* The beauty which he gave,
That he the more delight in the^ might have*
Thou ba^ely p^ostitutest unto those
That a^e thy lust^ull woo^rs, and his foes*
Thy Vines like ^^ose of Sodom are become,
Even like those plants, that are derived from
Gommorrah's Vineyard; and their Clusters all
Ar^ sour; or else, more bitter, far, then gall.
Thy Wi^e is Dragons poison: yea, thou have
In all thy pleasant things, a loathsome taste.
But, thus in gross, why should I l^nger sp^nd
My time, thy wickedness^ to reprehend?
Since thou art impudent, and have the face,
To make of the^e upbraidings my disgrace?
In my next Canto's therefore, I Will prefer
Of thy Transgr^ssions a PERTICVLER,
So du^y urged; that none shall justly say
I utter what I should not open lay:
Or th^^ my Verse does brand t^ee with a crime,
Whereof their lives not witness all this time.
Observe it; and if ought I mention here,
Not fitly ^poken t^ the public ^are;
O^ if, but in a word, I wrong thee shall;
Me to the most impartial c^nsure call*
Let my good purp^s^s be punished more,
And pitied* also less then heretofore.
Let me of all thy chil^ren be reviled;
From thy most pleasant Bord^rs live exiled:
And never be recalled. But, if I tell
What thy best Lovers shall app^ove of well.
I^ Truth I utter; and such Truth as is
To be discl^s'd: then ma^ke what is found amiss.
Amend thine errors* Le^ thy folly cease.
Love him, that loves unfainedly thy peace.
At least, despite him not. But, if thou do,
Yet he will serve thee still, and love th^e too:
Thy w^l^are rather then his own prefer:
And, leave this Bo^ke for thy REMEMBRANCER.
The sixth Canto.
The Poet (wei^hing w^ll his War^ant)
Goes on with his enjoined Arrant.
I^partially he does relate
This Iland^ good and bad estate.
What s^v'rall sins in her have place;
How gross they are; how they ^ncr^ase,
He also t^ls: and, then he sn^w^s
That nor the Gentiles, nor the Jews,
We^e ch^ck'd, or pl^gu^d for any Crimes,
Which are not reigning in th^se times.
N^xt that, he boldly does reprove
^he course in which ou^ Nobles love;
Derides their folly, blames their sin,
And warnes what dan^ers we are in.
Ou^ G^ntry then he repr^hends;
Their foolish humors dis^^n m^nds;
And (having brought them to their sights)
Upon the guilty Clergy lig^ts;
On Lawyers that abuse the Laws,
On Officers, and on the Cause
Of most Corruptions: Last of all
On some enormities does fall
Which are in Court and City found;
And runs this Canto, there, aground.
But, am I well a^vis'd? and do I know
From whence, and from what Spirit this does flow?
Do I remember what, and who I am,
That I this famous Monarchy should blame?
Am I assured no ill-suggesting Spirit
(In hatred of thine honou^able merit)
Seduceth me (oh Britain) that I might
Become an instrument of his despite?
Have I considered of what esteem
Thou art? How great thy Piety does seem?
What glorious titles, and trans^endent styles
Thou ^ast obtained above all other Isles?
What attributes unto thy self thou give?
What of thine own perfections thou beleevest?
And what thy fl^ttri^g Priests and Prophets say
O^ thy admired happ^nesse this day?
Yes, yes; all this I pondered, and I know
What g^o^ or evil from this act may flow.
I am not ignorant, that thou have been
Among the n^^ghb'ring Countries as a Queen,
Among ^er Ladies* Fo^mes of Government,
O^ Laws, or Custom^s through Earths Continent,
A^e no^e ^eceived that more pious be,
Or mo^e upright then those that are in thee.
Among fai^e Sions Daughter^, none does sit
M^^e free from blemishes (the^ t^ou art yet)
In points of Ch^istian Doctrine (though there are
Some, who that simpleness begin to mar)
No people does retain a Dis^ipline
More Ap^sto^^c^ll, ^hen some of thine.
No Church that is visible, has kept more pure
The grounds of Faith, nor countenanced fewer
Of Romes innumerable Superstiti^^s;
Of usel^sse, ^r of burdensome Tr^ditions,
Then thou ha^t lately done. I feel thou have
Some warmth yet left. As yet, so brazen-faced
Thou ^rt not grown, but that thou do despise
Notorious C^imes, and open Heresies;
Because the hidden Leaven of t^y sin
To sour the Lump, is (yet) but new put in.
I^le do thee right, and give thee all thy due,
Before thy follies further I pu^sue.
I know that thou with patience heretofore
(Even like the Church at Ephesus) have bo^e
Thy Christian Labors; that, thou have been moved
Against offenders; that, thou such have proved,
Who fa^sely did ^ffirme themselves to be
Apostles; and, strong ^aith was found in thee.
Yea, ^hou did long those heresies resist,
Which God abhors; and ^idst them detest.
I know* that like the Smyrnian Congregation
Thou have through pove^ty and tribulation,
Got heav'nl^ Riches: neither did thou fear,
When they, who of the Church of Satan were,
Blasphemed the Truth, and did themselves profess
True Isra'lites, when they were nothing less.
I know, that when ^hy Lot it was to dwell
Like Pergamus, even where the throne of Hell
Erected was (and in their bloody Reign,
By whom so many Martyrs here were slain)
Thou did not then the Faith of Christ deny,
Not from professing of his Gospel fly.
I know, that Thyatira-like thy love,
And t^y devotion did unfeigned prove;
And that thy piety, and righteousness,
Did (for a season) more and more increase.
I know, thy goodness i^ not quite bereft,
But that (like Sardis) thou some Names have left
That walk with Christ, from all pollution free,
In those white Garments that unspotted be.
I know, that like the Church of Philadelph,
Thou have a little strength within thy self:
Gods word, and holy Sacraments yet are
(As pledges of his love) preserved here.
An^ I do know, that, sin^e thou heretofore
Did love the Truth; God will his Grace restore,
On thy repentance; and in all temp^ation
Become thy sole-sufficient preservation;
Yea make all them, who now false boasters be
Of true Religion, to subscribe to thee;
Confess he loves thee; and to thee has given
That Ci^ies title, that came down from heaven.
But, much is, yet, amiss^; and (to prev^nt
Thy Ruin) I advise thee to r^pent.
Remember (oh! remember thou) from when^e
Thou fallen ^rt; and seek by penitence
To ^se again. Thy former works renew;
Thy lately practiced wi^kednesse esc^ew;
What thou have lost, ^nde^vor to regaine,
Hold ^ast that Faith which yet thou do retai^e;
Awake, and use thine utmost powers, to cherish
Those Graces, which in thee are like to perish.
O^! do it speedil^, whilst he does knock
Tha^ open the doo^e, which no man can unlock,
And shuts, where none does open: yea (lest he
Come suddenly, and take away from thee
Thy precious Candlestick) renew thy zeal;
And unto him thy sin, betimes, reveal.
Mark, to the Churches, what the Spirit says;
And purchase thou of Christ (by lively faith)
To make thee rich, gold t^yed in the fire.
To hide thy filthy nakedness, desire
The pure white ^^yment of his Righteousness.
Thy former sight, tha^ thou may reposs^sse,
His eye salve take: The conquest strive to get,
That of the hidden Manna thou may eat;
And g^ine the Stone inscribed with a Name,
Which none can know, but he that wea^es the same*
For, I must tell thee, thou art run astray,
And (like a whorish wife) have cast away
Thy old affection: thy fi^st-love is gone,
An^ other friends thy heart has doted on.
Thou ^st not halse that zeal, which thou have bore
To thy Redeemers honor heretofore;
That simpleness, thou have not in thy works;
Put, base d^ss^m^ling in thine actions lurkes.
Some Doctrines also are in thee professed,
Without ^eproofe, which God does much detest.
Thou do let go unpunished in thee,
Those persons that notorious sinners be,
And impudently wicked: thou make light
Of their misdeeds, in virtuous men's despite.
Thou have connived at those, who in the Land
Have with an high, and an imperious hand
(Like Iezabel) oppressed, and bereav'n
Thou poor man's portion, in contempt of Heaven.
Thou have blasphemers, who d^e falsely say,
That they are Catholics, (and none but they)
Yet, if they heeded what their words imply,
Their own Distinction giv^s themselves the Lie.
The Babylonish Strumpet thou (as yet)
Within ^^y territories do permit*
Who does s^duce Gods people, and thy N^^ions;
And make them drunken with her Fornications.
Tho have those Hypocrites that make a show
Of zeal^^s hearts, when they are nothing so.
T^ou have those B^alamites* that in the way
Of weak Prof^ss^rs, stumbling blocks do lay:
And pra^tise cunning slei^ht^ o^ policy,
To bring thee b^^ke unto Idolatry.
To trouble and di^tract thee* they invent
St^ange qu^stions, dou^tfull, and impertinent.
By needless provings, by their vain confuting^,
By over nice distinctions, and disp^ting^,
And by their multitudes of windy notions,
They have so in^orrupted thy devotions,
So over whelmed thy Fait^; so tired out
Thy knowledge, (with still running round about)
That there is left but little care in thee,
How much decayed thy good manners b^.
Indeed, of thy lost Virtues, there is a Fame
Remaining still; and thou have yet a Name
To be alive; but, some do greatly fear
That thou art either d^^d* or very near.
Though Laodicea like thou proudly vauntest,
That rich thou art, and that thou nothing want^st:
Though thou art h^ppy in thine own esteem,
And do to thine own self quick-sighted seem:
Yet, were thy Judgment cleared, thou would find
That thou art wretched, naked, poor, and blind.
Thou do almost that lukewarm temper hold,
Which neither can be termed hot, nor cold.
Thy wi^kednesse is (well near) grown as ripe,
As hers, that served for thy Prototype.
Nay, Gods great Volume mentions not a sin,
Wherewith or place, o^ person, taxt has bin,
But thou have practiced it; and of thine own
Host added others, to those times unknown.
With our first Parents, there are some in thee*
Who ^trive to eat of Gods forbidd^n tree;
And have upon them such an itch to know
Those t^ing^ which he v^uchsafeth not to show:
That, from their eyes true wis^dome it has hid,
And m^re en^ang r'd them, then Ad^m did.
Thou have a brood of Cainites, that envi^s
Their bre^hrens better pleasing sacrifice;
And pe^secut^s, and slanders, (what it may)
All those that walk not in their wi^ked way:
And th^rst with greediness to shed t^eir blood,
Who seek their safeties, and effect their good.
There be, am^ng thee, some just like that Race,
Who (being made the Sons of God, by Grace)
Did with man's female issue fall in love;
And these beget a mungrell brood, that prove
The Giants of their times; and, those, that will
The measure of the worlds misdeeds fulfill.
They (as those careless people did, on whom
An universal Deluge once did come)
Eat, drink, and take their pleasure, without care,
How many or how great their follies are.
And, though a Judgment on their head is poured,
They will not heed it, till they are devoured.
As soon as any Pla^ue from us is gone,
We build and plant, and in our sins run on:
Or when (with Noah) blessings we have had,
(In st^ad of being in Gods favor glad)
We do in some vain mi^th bewray our folly;
I^ drunken feastings, or in games unholy.
Since out of beastly Sodom they were got,
Thy Children have among themselves (like Lot)
Committed much uncleanness; whence proceeds
A Race, which discord in thy borders breeds.
Like Laban, many wickedly detain
The workmans hire; and make unlawful gain
From their own Children. Some (with Isma^l)
Are bitter mockers; some (with Esau) sell
Their heavenly Birthrights: and for what do you think?
For worse then porridge* even for smoke and slinke.
We have a^ m^g^ty Hunters (now adays)
As Nimrod, and as wilful in their ways.
Some, of their brethren merchandises make,
Li^e Jacobs Sons, and money for them take.
With Simeon, and with Levi; some, pretend
Religions cause; when for some other end
They do proj^ct: and, m^^kes of holy zeal
Do often bloody cruelties conceal.
For wives, for wealth* and for our vai^e d^lights,
We change Religion, like the Sichemites*
We have those Judges, who will ( Iudah-like)
Their brother, for his fault severely strike;
Deride, taunt, censure, and without compassion,
To death condemn him, for the same transgression
Which they are far more guilty o^ then he:
And, those the Plague-sores of this Island be.
We have in either sex, of those that are
As wicked as the wife of Potiphar.
Even those, who so will slander, and accuse;
If any to obey their lust refuse.
Like Er and On^n, we have wicked heirs,
Who rather would consume themselves, and theirs,
In fruitless* vanities, then part from ought
By which their brothers welfare might be wrought*
With Phar'oh, we Gods judgments do contemn*
And grow the bolder, and the worse by them.
When he most plagued us, we most presumed;
And sinned most, when we were most consumed.
Nor blood, nor frogs, nor loathsome lice, nor flies,
Nor murraines, biles, nor botches can suffice
To make our Nations their bad lives reform;
Nor Locusts, nor the leafe-devouring worm;
Nor horrid darkness, liable to sense,
Nor Hail, nor Thunders, nor the Pestilence;
Nor bringing us to sp^ings that bitter are;
Nor sweetning those things that unsav'ry were;
Nor strange deliv'rances by sea and land;
Nor Gods protecting us with his own hand;
Nor Q^ailes, nor Manna, (blessings which be rare)
Nor favou^s which more ordinary are:
No, nor Gods dreadful Anger, nor his Love,
Can our hard hearts unto repentance move;
But, we (l^ke Aegyp^) in rebellion be,
And, full as faithless as the Jews, are we*
Among us, we have wealthy men, who may
W^ole Groves dispend; yet on the Sabbath day
They Will gather sticks. Even to the Devil, some
With no less worthy sacrifices come,
Then sons and daughters. For, what less do they
Who them in wedlock wickedly betray
To open Heretics? Or, they that make
Their mar'ages, for wealth, and hor^ors sake,
Without affection? And (I pray) what less
Do they, who force their children to profess
Unlawful trades? There be among us, living,
Too many, that, even whilst the Law is giving,
Do^ set up golden-calves. Such men are they,
Who in the Church, or on Gods Holiday,
Are plodding on the world; whil^t they should bend
Their ears to God, and on his will attend.
We have (our best proceedings to withstand)
A Iannes, and ^amb^es in the Land,
Who (by their ^orceries) continue shall
Some people of this M^narchy in ^hrall:
Until a Plague (like Ae^ypts ^owsinesse)
Shall make them God Almighty, power confess.
Young Vadab^ and A^^h^es, we have some,
That with strange fires unto Go^s altars come:
T^^ir dull devotions kindled are with sticks,
And withered leaves of humane Rhetoricks;
They offer up to God, their vain Orations,
Composed of Cli^bings, and Adnominations;
Which he abhor^es; with all that frothy stuff,
Of which this age hat^ more then thrice enough.
Our brethren by extortion we oppress:
True st^ange^, (nay, our kin) are harbou^lesse;
And those o^fences we have Patrons for,
Which many Heathen people did abhor.
With Miriam and with Laron, we have such,
Who at their (...) preferment grutch;
Hot spirits, trouble^om^ to civil states;
Like C^rah and his rude confederates.
These a^gue match for p^p'lar p^rities,
And rail upon all civil di^^iti^s;
But* when they can attain the^, none speak louder
In their de^ence; nor are there any prouder.
We Gallants have mo^e imp^dent, then e're,
Young Z^nri, and his Caz^i did appear:
And doubtl^sse we have (...) who ^^ve hidden
Some Babylonish things which are forbidden.
For all the Land much troubled we may see;
And many think, it shall not quiet be,
Till they be found. Reveal thou their transgressions,
O Lord! and be thou praised in their confessions.
We have, this day, amongst us, many a Bramble,
That, like Abimelech, knows how to scramble
Abov^ their own deservings: and (though base
Unworthy ^hrubs) durst arrogate a place
More eminent, then dares the noblest Plant,
Whereof the Mountain Libanus does vaunt.
By others vert^es these ascend on high,
And raise themselves to such authority,
That our most noble Cedars are o're-topt;
Our pleasant Figtrees, are b^scratcht and dropped*
Our Vines are shadowed, and unfruitful made;
Our Olives robbed of that oil they had;
Yea, all our forest and our garden trees,
By their ambition, fruit, or honor, leese.
Thou nourisht have, and fondly doted on
Those cunning Dalilahs, who having won
Thy good respect, do practice how to spy
Wherein the chiefest of our strength does lie;
That (having by their flatt'ries lulled asleep
Those watchme^s eyes that should our fortress keep)
They may (unheeded) steal our power away,
And to our greatest Foes our lives betray.
Here want not such as Michah, who with ease
Can make a new Religion when they please;
Coin ^ormes of worship proper to their Sect;
A private Church among themselves erect;
Make Priests at their own pleasure; furnish them
Even with their own newfangled Teraphim;
And preach abroad for good Divin^ty,
The tumors of their windy fantasy:
Nay, some of them far stranger things can do;
For, they can make their gods, and eat them too.
There be of us, as wilful Favorites
Of wicked men, as were the Benjami^es;
And, rather then we will deliver them
To feel the stroke of Justice, who contemn
The ways of goodness; we will h^zardize
Our peace, our fame, and our posterities.
We have those Prophets, who (with Balam) know
Gods pleasure, and what way they ought to go:
And, yet, will for preferment do their best,
That they his plain revealed Will may wrest.
And though they are, perhaps, ashamed to say
Their minds in public, closely they will betray
The Lords inheritance; and Scripture proof
Infer for all things to their own behoof.
If of the pop'lar faction these become,
And think some gain may be achieved from
That side; Gods word they will produce for those
That would disloyally their King oppose:
If by the Prince advantage may be had,
Then, God himself an instrum^nt is made
To warrantize their claims; an^, Tyranny,
Shall pr^ved be a lawful M^narchy.
As rash as Iephth^, in our vows are we;
As Ehu^s gift, such often our presents be.
In ent^rtainments, some like Iael are;
And, in their complements may well compare
With bloody Ioa^: for, they make their table
Become a snare: and (when most serviceable
They do appear) unheeded, they unsheath
So^e fat^ll instru^ent, that wounds to death.
Like old indulgent Eli, some connive
At all the sins, in which the^r children live:
Nay, glory in their lewdness; and maintain
In them those follies, which they should restrain;
Till their own shame, and their undoing follows,
And their wild brood be tamed at the Gallows.
Nor were the sons of Eli, heretofore
More wanton at the Tabernacle door,
Then some young Priests of ours; whom to correct,
The Fathers of our Church so much neglect,
That if they long connive as they have done,
The glory of our Israel will be gone.
Like those Philistians, whose advice it was
To fix God's Arc, and Dagon, in one place,
We have too many; and, they cannot see,
Why God and Baal in one, should not agree.
But, when they raise their I^ol in these Lands,
Lord, let it fall, and lose both head and hands.
We are as cur^ous as the B^thsh^mites,
And long as much to see forbidden sights:
Like those of Ekron, we profess to know
The truest Go^, and whence our troubles grow:
Yet, are so stupid, that we slight his Grace,
And, send him from us, to another place.
Yea, like the Gadarens, we for our Sw^ne,
Would banish Christ, and slight his love divine:
Wi^h Saul, we do neglect what should be done*
And sacrifice, when God requires none.
Fat Sheep and Oxen were prefer before
O^edience to the Lord; and follow more
Our wills then his. When God says kill, we spare,
And where he bi^s, be kind, we cruel are.
No love, no kindness, no sincerity,
No tokens of unfeigned piety
Can stay our furies, or divert our mind.
When we are once maliciously inclined.
Goliath like, Gods army some contemn;
With R^bsh^k^h, some others do blaspheme;
Some curse (with Shimei) Gods best beloved;
As causelessly, to ^rieve them they are moved,
And are of gain as greedy. For, if they
Have but an us^^sse Groom escaped away,
(O^ lost a beast) for such a petty prise,
They will not stick their l^ves to haza^dize.
We have those Michols, which will scoff and flou^
At such as are mo^^ zealously devout.
We have those dog-like Doegs in our Courts,
That gladly hear and utte^ all reports,
To disadvanta^e them, whose ways a^e pure,
And cannot their impieties endure.
We have those Nabals, upon whom all cost,
All curtefies, and kindnesses a^e lost.
We have (like Vzzah) those that dare to touch
Gods holy Arc. Nay, we have worse then such,
Even those that rob it; and themselves adorn
With Jewels, from the San^tuary torn.
With David, some have thought their sins to hide*
And, their Adulteries, in Murder died.
Officiou^ knaves (like Ziba) we have some,
Who by their Masters falls, to gre^tnesse come;
And (though they did men inno^ent betray)
Without reproving, they do pass away.
We have those wicked A^mons, who defile
Their sisters. And, to lay a cunning wile
For helping their companions to a drab,
We have more subtle Bauds then ^onadab.
Those disobedient Absoloms there be
Among us ^ere^t at wish and seek to see
Their Parents dea^hs; like him they can conceal
Their ends, till they (by fair dissembling) steal
Men's hea^ts away; and then abuse them so,
That all seems just and honest which they do.
We have Achitophels, that are a^ wise
Against Gods honor, projects to devise,
As if the Delphian Oracle were sought:
But, still in their own pit-fals they are caught.
For, he that honest purposes does bless,
Conve^ts their wisdom into foolishness.
We have with Solomon (though none so wise)
Men won by women to Idolatries.
With Jeroboam, we have those who strive
A settled temp'rall fortune to contrive
By ruining Religion; and to win
An outward peace, by tolerating sin:
Not heeding, that a greatness so procured,
Has seldom to a third descent endured.
To serve an Idol we like him proceed,
Although Gods Messengers reprove the deed.
And though our arm be withered, for our sin,
Our obstinacies we continue in.
We want not Re^oboams Counselors,
Whose unexperienced Policy prefers
H^rsh courses, rather then a calm proceeding;
When times are troublesome, and dangers breeding.
We have (with Ahab) those who covet so
Their neighbors Vineyard, that they f^llen grow,
And can nor eat, nor sleep, till they may plot,
How their ungodly longings may be got:
And we have Iezabels enough, to further
Their claims by slanders, perjury, and murder.
Nor want such Elders, and such Nobles here,
As those that Citizens with Naboth were.
For should (as God forbid) our hopeful King,
Desire to compass any lawless thing,
Or seek his loyal Subjects to bereave
Of what their Ancestors to them did leave:
We have of those (I doubt) that would effect it
According to their power: nay, project it,
And urge him, and persuade him, that (of right)
He overthrow their lawful freedoms might.
We have of those (I fear) that would command
A Fast (like Iez^bels) throughout the Land,
And underneath a mask of Piety,
Proceed to practice any Villainy,
Which might advance their greatness: and, I doubt
Some Priests would help to set the project out.
Yea, we those Iud^es, and those Elders have,
That if a man his neighbors Vineyard crave,
He need not, for his purpose, name the King,
Or Letters from the royal Signet bring
To move the same: Nor were it necessary
That (to corrupt them) he Epistles carry
From some great Lords. For, if he can but make
The tongues of golden Angels for him speak;
Or get some one, on his behalf to write,
That is but servant to a Favorite;
The deed is done: and they will feel no sense
Of others griefs* or o^ their own offense.
We have such Prophets a^ Zidkiah was,
Who are no whit ashamed, in public place,
To speak fal^e messages; and those to smite,
Tha^ in Gods name have spoken what is right.
We have Gehezies; fellows that will take
Unlawful bribes* even those who sale do make
Of what their Maste^s should have, gratis, done;
And force out fees, where they can challenge none.
Gehezies did I call this crew? I fea^e
I wrong the Leper: for his brib'ri^s were
Put petty pillages, to those rich preyes,
On which some one of these his fingers lays.
He asked, and had a willing gratulation,
From one both rich, and of another Nation:
^ut, these extor^, compel^, and stil^ serve
Unjust demandings, as a lawful due.
From friends, from strangers, from both poor and rich
Their fingers to be scraping have an itch.
For making their poor suitor, wait and pray,
(When they might have dispatched him) he must pay.
For surly speeches, and for proud neglect,
They must be humoured with all respect.
When to their ^lient, they a w^ong have done,
He must not seem to know or think ^hereon;
But, feign all noble thoughts of them to have,
Or, in some other persons call them knave*
And bribe them still, in hope they may be won,
Yet, at the last, be cheated and undone.
We have among us, men as very fools
As Na'man was; who think Damascus pooles
A^ good as Jordan: and (like him) at home
Some serve one God; and when to Court they come,
Profess another. We have those that be
As trustlesse of Gods promises, as he,
Who in Samar^a^s gate was trodden on:
These may behold the favors which are done
To faithful men; but, till they can believe,
They shall not taste what blessings those receive.
Here be like Haz'el, those who seem to hate
All tyrannizing, in their low estate;
Yet, being once promoted, throw aside
All pity; and all piety deride.
Yea, that which forme^ly they did condemn,
(As vilifying, and debasing them,
Below a Dogs condition) they allow,
When to their height of ^reatnesse once they grow.
(If none yet live) we had in former time,
Even those that guilty were of Zimries c^ime.
Most Officers like Iehu, do begin
Good reformation, at first entering in;
Their violent Zeal does seem to say, Come see,
How just in our proceedings we will be.
But, often they prove mee^e Hypocrites, who having
Acquired meane^ to color their deceiving,
Surpass the worst; and by degrees proceed,
Till they appear the men they were indeed.
Like wicked Haman; some, unless they may
Insult and trample on poor Mordecai,
Are so distempered by their haughty mind,
That they nor pleasure, nor contentment find,
In honors, riches, or in any blessing,
Which they already have in t^eir possessing:
But, will pursue, and ruin, if they can,
Whole Kingdoms, for their malice to one Man.
As p^oud are we as Nebuch^dnezar:
In feastings, as profuse as Bal^hazar,
And as prop^ane as he. We sometime seek
The god of ^kron, Abaziah like.
Like Amiziah (an informing Priest
Of Bethel) we have those that will resist
Gods Messengers; and would not hear them bring
Into the Court or Chapel of the King*
The sound of that reproo^e or punishment,
Which to pronounce among us they we^e sent:
And, these, perhaps, when they my Arrand see,
Will prove as busy as that Priest with me.
But, if they do (as Amos sa^d to him)
Although I be no Prophet, nor of them
That are the sons of Prophets; God does know
He called me to thi^ (which now I do)
From viler actions, then from gathering fruit,
Or foll'wing herds: And I will make pursuit
Of what he b^ds me; though o^pos'd I stand,
By all the Priests and Prelates in the Land.
And if they contradict, what well is done
Their heads, at last, the sh^me shall light upon.
Some ^ourtiers now, like Daniels foes, there are,
That will object as things piacular,
The truest Piety; and s^eke to bring
Even those to be suspected of the King,
Who strive most loyally, to keep his Name
In honor; and his Kingdom without blame.
As Judah had (in Zephaniahs times)
Her Priests of Baal; the name of Chemarims;
Those, who the heavenly army did adore;
Those also, who by God, and Mal^^om, swore;
And multitudes among them, who did wear
Fantastic Habits: So, we harbor here
Some Shavelings yet; some Romish superstitions;
To Saints we offer up some vain petitions;
Equivocating Oaths we often take;
And, we our selves, in our apparel, make
Deformed, by a skittish imitation
Of every newfound guise, in every Nation.
I do not think (nor have I ever thought)
That in it self it is material ought,
What shaped Robes I wear: nor do I hold
That any Fashion, whether new or old,
Does so much handsome or disfigure any,
As it may seem to do, perchance, to many.
It is the Time, or else their minds, that wear
Such clothes, which make them good or bad appear.
Those fools who bring new fashions first; and they
That have to follow them (and think it gay
And generous) are those unworthy ones,
That bring such folly, shame, and cost upon's.
But, when those Garbes grow general; then, we
That first abhorred them, compelled be
To take them up: lest our old clothes be thought
New fashions from some foreign kingdoms brought:
Or, lest we shoul^d by some be thought to err,
In being over nice, and singular.
Most other people, both at home, and here,
Do in their habits, like themselves appear:
But, wheresoever we come, we change our shapes,
And, in our gestures, are all N^tions Apes.
True gravity, we so are fallen from,
And, so absurdly blockish are become;
That, strangers jeere us, to behold how soon
We get the garb of every fond Baboon.
Yea, they are proud, to see that we condemn
Ou^ o^ne attires, by imitating them.
And I do blush to think, that our whole Nation
Should of it self admit a transformation,
So suddenly (as oftentimes we see)
To imitate the guise of two or three.
But, so it is: And at this present ti^e,
Our female Gentry is so frenchifi'd;
That we have scarce a Gentlewoman now,
In clothes, more handsome bodied then a Cow.
Those women who e're while were goodly creatures,
Proportion having, and (me thought) sweet features;
Do look as triple-bodi'd Gerion did,
When they in their mis shapen gowns are hid:
For, either arm, in such a mould is cast,
As makes it full as fulsome as their waste.
Their necks stand sneaking out, before those rustes,
Which lie behind their backs with wide mouthed puss
As does a peeled Ewes, whose fleece unshorne,
Was from about her neck with brambles torn.
Their flaring cu^les about their shag-shorne brows,
Do, of the fairest Lady, make a blouse.
Those demy-skarfes, they wreathe about their chaps,
(Which may be comely to some^ eyes, perhaps)
Do make them seem as Antick-like to me,
As Hag^, that sent to fright young children be.
And I am sorry, that a foolish pride
Should make our Beauties their perfections hide
In such a masking suit. And that a few
Fantastic women, so great numbers drew
To follow their new-fangles; and besot
Their judgments, by that fashion newly got.
For, not mean wits alone; but, of the wisest;
(Nay, of the most religious, and precisest)
There are great multitudes befooled in this:
And, She, that of that Guise their Pattern is,
(Perhaps) derides their fickleness. For she
Is from their mind, and from their folly free.
Naught, but her count^y fashion, she has worn:
And, that which them deformes, does her adorn.
Yea, they have either missed o^ her dress:
Or else she gives it much more loveliness,
For to my eye there is some excellence
Which puts t'wixt her and them much difference*
And this opinion is not mine alone:
For* so much has been said by many a one.
Oh! show the sweetness of your disposition,
In hearing me, and granting my petition.
Lay off your strange attires, that we may know
If you be Englishwomen, yea or no.
Your monstrous habit, each true Britain lothes;
And, were your bodies formed like your clothes,
(Which, God in Justice, may effect, perchance)
You might go seek your fortunes out in France,
From whence your new prop^rt^on hither came:
For, we shall never truly love the same.
Because, if other men have thoughts like mine,
It would appear to be some fatal sign,
To see our women leave their native fashion,
And, turn themselves into another Nation.
But, let these Females go I hope that she
Who shall be mine (if any such the^e be)
What ever accident or change be^alls,
Will still retain her English na^urals.
More bl^me then this might in this kind be laid
On women: but, unwillingly I said
What here is uttred. And, if they had bin
In those attires that I have seen them in,
I had not on this oversight reflected;
But, left them to be counseled and directed
By their near Friends or Husbands. Yet, ala^!
We have of them, whose levity does pass
The ^icklenesse of these: and, they alone
Are often the cause, that th^se have so misgone.
Nor ever did this folly more appear,
Then now it does; ^v'n in this very year,
Where^n the Pestilence devoured so:
And, as that Plague de^reased, this did grow.
But, in Trans^ressions, how we parallel
The times before, I will proceed to tell.
High Priest have we, who send ou^ spies to watch
The Preachers of Gods word; and pick, and catch
Advantages against them. Some of us
Are like the Silver-smiths at Ephesus,
And, for their private lucre will contend
Against the Truth, and Heresies defend.
We, Demas like, have those Apostataes,
Who, for the world, forsake the Christian cause.
And, some there be, that with Diotrophes,
Affect pre-eminence in these our days.
Some, like the Scribes and Pharisees do rinse
The Cup without; but, have no care to cleanse
The loathsome inside. Some, have arrogated
Such Holiness, that they are separated
From others, as a spotless Congregation,
That is without all blame, or profanation.
Some, like to those, their Brethren d^s^espect:
And, lo^dly titles overmuch affect,
As did the Jewish Rabbis. Some, as they
On others backs uneasy burdens lay:
Which they themselves, to carry do refuse.
The Orphane, and the Widow, some abuse,
By shows of piety. And, we have some,
In tything Anniseed, and Mint, become
Exceeding zealous: yet, have neither care
Nor conscience, in those things that weighty are.
We have our several Brotherhoods of those,
Who seriously do Sea and Land enclose,
(And practice, by a multitude of sleights)
To win unto their Sects new p^oselites:
Not out of love to Truth, or Charity,
But rather to advance their Heresy.
Who ever all their crotchets does embrace,
Is instantly become the child of Grace,
(In their opinions) whatsoever he
In other points, or in his manners be.
Bu^ whosoever he be that shall despise,
One branch of any toy, which they devise,
Is judged a Reprobate. Yea, though in all
The grounds of Faith, and in his works he shall
Appear unblemished; they will contemn
His judgment; and traduce and censure him.
Yea, some of those there be who have des^ride
A trick to know who are unsanctifide;
Though they have all the ma^kes of holin^sse.
Nay, some a^e not ashamed to confess,
To know what persons those hid ma^ks do bear,
Which known to no men but their wearers are.
Like Ananias, and Saphira, here
Are they that holy Brethren do^ appear,
Yet want sin^erity. And, I could tell y^
Of Multitudes, who merely for their belly,
Do follow Christ. With Herod, we have such
Who hear m^n gladly, till those Crimes they touch
Which are their Darlings: But, then mad they grow,
And what they truly are, they truly show.
Like Dives, we have those that every day
Are fed with dainties; clothed with rich array,
And, full as merciless unto the poor,
That lie unclothed, and hungry at the door.
We have a rattle-brain'd and wilful Crew,
That with a purblinde zeal the Truth pursue:
And would be found, were not their pow'^ so small,
More bloody, and more violent th^n Paul,
Before his name wa^ c^anged: for, they tear
That Robe, whereof they do profe^se a care.
We have those Nobles, who with Felix, can
Confess the inn^cency of a m^n
Accused before them; and, yet leave him bound,
If ought to their advant^ge may r^dound.
We have of those that parcel Christians be,
As King ^grippa. Othersome have we
That walk for company, they care not whither;
And, some that slight Religion alt^gether.
Nor want we those, that while they Christ profess,
Convert his Graces into wantonness^.
We are almost as wicked as old Rome:
Of Heresi^s we are as full become,
As Amsterdam. Nay, many men have we,
That can of three or ^oure profession^ be,
(Even all at once) although that every Sect
Each other does directly contradict.
We have an Elimas, who does apply
His cunning to pervert the Depu^y:
Like Simon Magus, we have Merchants here,
That were baptized; and yet without fear,
Dare buy and sell those things that holy be;
And which, by Gods donation, should be f^ee.
Nay, in the gall of bitterness they lie,
More deep then he, from whom their Symony
Deriveth name: for, he, in show, repenting,
Did crave the Churches prayers for preventing
Of his deserving: whereas, these devise
Quaint arguments* their sin to patronize;
Or make it less. Else, by equivocation,
Or, by their trick of m^ntall reservation,
They hide their fault: and (that the s^n they do
May grow compl^at) themselves they perjure too.
There be, that Mammon, for their God, adore:
That make Christ's members, members of a whore:
And stained be with those offenses all,
Wher^of the Gentiles were accused, by Paul.
We all are guilty of much fraud, debate,
Imp^ety, uncleanness, envy, hate,
Backbiting, stealing, pride, maliciousness,
Dissembling, murder, lying, spightfulnesse,
Truce breaking, disobedience, ignorance,
Implacability, bold arrogance,
Want of affections natural, excess,
Inhumane cruelty, ungratefulness:
Blaspheming, swearing; and innumerable
Transgressions more, of that ungodly rabble:
And, some (when God Almighty poured has
Upon their heads the Viols of his wrath)
In stead of penitence, increase the score
Of their offenses; and, blaspheme the more.
Nay, that we may be partners of their guilt,
That have the blood of Gods Anointed spilt,
With Pilate and the Jews, we have, again,
The Lord of Life, both crucified, an^ slain.
Thou have, Oh Britain, every thing misdone,
That Ashur, Moab, Ammon, Babylon,
Or any Kingdom has transgressed in,
Which unto Piety a foe has bin.
Of whatsoever Israel was detected,
For whatsoever Judah was corrected,
Thou may be taxed; for, among thy Nation^
Are daily practiced their abominations.
Their tricks thou have, to hinder and oppress,
Those men who tell thee of thy wickedness.
Right so thou do debase; so slander them:
Right so, their just reproves thou do contemn:
And, though their words are daily verifide,
Yet, thou do always wilfully deride
Their admoni^ions; and, pass all things by,
As falling on thee but by casualty.
I do believe, and know, that, yet, in thee
Some Obadiahs, and some Ezraes be.
Some Courtiers, and some Nobles yet remain,
Which do their true Nobility retain:
But, most of them their dignity have lost;
And can of naught but painted Scuch^ons boast.
As did of theirs, the Jewish Prophet say,
Thy Princes do procrassinate the day
Or thy Calamity; and will not hear,
O^ that affliction which approaches near:
But, of Iniquity they climb the seat;
And, by extortion make their house^ great.
Their Palaces, they seele and trim with gold,
Gods Temples being ruinously old.
On beds (more precious then of Ivory)
They stretch themselves, and live luxuriously.
The pasture Lambs, and wainlings of the stall,
Suffice not them; but they make prey of all.
Which lives in the wood, or in the field;
Or which the land, the sea, or air does yield.
Their lushious wines in precious bowls they quaff^*
While Joseph is afflicted, they do laugh;
And sing unto the Violl, wanton strains,
While Syon in captivity remains.
They have but little care of Gods commands;
They break his yoke, and cast away his bands.
Thy men in honor, without knowledge be,
Like beasts that perish; and, dishonor th^e.
Some have aspired to their present heights
Of wealth and greatness, by ignoble sleights:
Of others houses, they have got possession,
And, furnished their chambe^s, by oppression.
Their wives and children, waste in brave attire,
The poor man's portion, and the workmans hire.
Their credits they have pawned, to main^aine
Their luxury, their pride, or gaming vain.
And, by their Honors ^ave so falsely sworn.
That men their Idol, and their oath do scorn.
Some, have so blushlesse and so shameless been,
To let their Coach, and foot-cloth horse, be seen
At common Strumpets doors: their Favorites,
(And they, in whom their Nobleness delights)
A^e gamesters, ^oarers, persons dissolute,
And such; for unto them such best do suit.
To bold faced Rimers, Iesters, or to those
Who make their Lordships laugh with foolish prose;
To Fence^s, Fiddlers, Tumblers, and to such,
W^o any way t^eir sensual humors touch,
Their hands are prodigal; and these obtain
Rich favors to requite their idle pain.
Their tongues, to speak on their behalf are free;
When questioned for the foulest c^imes they be.
(Even fellonies and murthe^s) but a^e mutes
In virtuous causes, and in honest suits.
When wise and painful men, have spent their wealth,
Their strength consumed, or impaired their health,
In profitable works; and to reveal
Such things as might advance the public weal;
Their labors (for the most) are over-past
Without encouragement; sometimes, disgrac^d
By arrogant impostors; who arise
To greatn^ss^, by discrediting the wise;
Or broaching such good projects for their own,
Which were by those men's industry made known,
Whom they have ruined. For, what were some
(That now to places eminent are come)
Before they got aloft on others wines,
But poor unworthy, and ignoble things?
Nay, what (as yet) appear they (unto those
Whose good experience their true value knows)
But gild^d ignorance? who having got
The shadows of the substance they have not,
Do pass for men of worth, in their esteeming,
Whom they have cheated, by a cunning seeming.
Admit but some of the^e into such place,
Which may afford them privilege or grace,
To speak before their Prince; and you shall hear
Their tongues to run, as if their knowledge were
A^ great as Solomon's; and that of all
The pl^nts, even from the Hysope of the wall,
Unto the Cedar, they could tell the nature;
And knew the qualities of ev'^y creature.
They, Pro^eus like, will any thing appear;
A Seaman, Ship-wright, or an Engin^ere,
Or what soever they list: and having bought
Of some poor Artists; or (some worse way) wrought
Their project from them, that they may be shown,
As if the quaint invention were their own:
(And, having gotten also terms of Art,
To help them in the acting of their part)
To such opinion of themselves they rise,
That men of soundest knowledge they despise;
Deride experience; and, even to their face,
The skill of most approved men disgrace.
M^ke these men Counselors, and though till then
They knew not half so much as common men,
Nor had the means of knowing any thing,
But how to ride a horse, or take the Ring,
Or hunt, or hawk, or caper: yet (behold
A wonder) in a moment they grow old
In State affairs; and nothing does concern
Or peace o^ war, which they have need to learn.
If any question be, before these, made,
Of Merchandise; the skilfull'st in the trade
Are fools to them; and it is an arrogance
To offer to instruct their ignorance.
If arms be treated of, there is no man knows
By practice, that which th^se men can disclose
By contemplation. And though they have seen
No other wars but those at Mile end green,
Or Tutle-fields; great Mars himself, of these
May learn to be a Soldier, if he please.
If any thing concerning Navigation,
Be tendered to a grave consideration,
These either dare affirm, or to deny
What all the Masters of the Trinity
Oppos^ them in; and Nov^ces would make
Of H^wkings, Frob^sh^r, and f^mous Dr^ke,
Were they now living. And, yet such a^ they,
The wreathes of Honor soonest bear away.
With empty Names, and Titles, b^ing ^lowne
Above themselves, they are unweildy grown;
An^ g^^ater in their pride, and in their train,
Then their consume^ fortunes will maintain.
Which does compel them, by unworthy ways,
To seek the patching up of their decays:
And, still in their p^ofusenesse they proceed,
As if their pro^^gality should breed
New fortunes; and, were like those wells that fill,
And grow the purer, by exhausting still.
In feasts, apparel, furniture, and things
Of such like nature, many Christian Kings,
To equal them shall find it much to do:
But, them they cannot very far outgoe,
Unless they mean to draine their fountains dry,
With Fools, in prodigality, to vye.
Hence comes it, that the Rents and Royalties
Of Kings and Princes, which did well suffice
In former times, to keep in comely port
An honored, and an hospitable Count,
(Yea, and an Army if occasion were)
Can hardly now the charge of household bear*
For, they must either in their large expe^ce,
Come short of that p^ofuse magnificence
Among their Vassals: o^ else waste away
The price of many Lordsh^ps, to defray
The cost of one vain supper; and, from this,
With other such like things, grows all am^sse.
For, one exc^sse another still produces;
One Fool out-vies his fellow Fools abuses;
Vnt^ll their wealth, and hop^s, and reputation,
Be wasted in a witn^sse emulation:
Not heeding what is taught them in the Fable,
That when a Toad has sweld while he i^ ^ble,
An Ox is bigger, and with ease can smite
His pride to nothing when it is at heig^t.
This over la^ge profuseness, they are feign
By many evil cou^ses to maintain:
By bribery, by g^iping, by the sale
Of Justice yea of Consci^nce, and of all
That may be sold for money. From hence springs
Deceiving, and mis-leading of good Kings.
This makes their Treasuries to ebb so low;
This, makes their Subjects discontented grow;
This, makes the Me^chant, and the Tradesman, break;
This, makes the arm of Justice grow so weak;
By this, are States unjointed, by degrees;
By this, their honor and their love they leese;
And, that confusion in upon them steals,
Which ruins Nations, Kings, and Commonweales.
From hence are all those rascal Suits derived,
By which the common damage is contrived:
Hence, they (who by the public desolation
Would raise themselves) pretend the^reformation
They purpose not: and, by their fair pr^tences
To ^ure old griev^n^es, breed new off^nces.
Hence comes it, that to keep themselves on hie,
They sell their country, and p^sterity
To slave^y and bondage; ca^ing naught*
So they have rest, how dearly it be bought.
This, makes the Gr^nts of Kings ^ecome so tickle,
An^ O^ders, and De^rees of State, s^ si^kle,
That no man knows when he has ought procured,
How he, of what he has may be assu^ed;
For, in a righteous cause, though be proceed,
And have it ^atified and decreed,
By all Authority that may be gained;
A slight suggesti^n (without reason f^ined)
May ^^u^tr^t^ make the Royall-confirmation,
O^ k^^p him in an endl^sse exp^ctation,
Till he be quite undone. And, if his foes
Have weal^h* (though no good reasons to oppose
His rig^tfull cause) he may be whe^l'd about,
With O^ders, tha^ will ^^tch him in and out,
Till he be tired: and, neith^r side is sure
O^ conq^est, till the other can p^ocure
No brib^ to give. Which is m^re wicked far,
Then thos^ injustices which practiced are
In heathen Kingdoms: since, when any t^ere,
For Justice or Injusti^e b^ibed are;
A man ^h^ll have his bargain. And in this
More just they be then many a Christian is.
For, when some here a^e forced for their own
To give great fines, they afterward a^e thrown
From their possessions if another come
To buy Injustice with a larger sum.
O^! what a madness is it, for one day
On earth, to fool Eternity away?
To sell both soul and body for mere toys;
And r^all comfort^, for deceiving joys?
To build the^r house with mortar, which will bu^ne
The timber, and the structure overturne?
Perchance before the finishing be done,
But (doubtless) e're the third descent be gone?
What folly is it for a man to waste
At one vain triumph (which an hour does last)
Mo^e then the portion, ten and ten times told
Which all his predecessors leave him could;
That, to his prejudice it may be known,
How hastily a ri^h man he is grown?
What means he, who does consume upon
One banquet, wh^t a town of Garrison
Might live a year withal; to hear it spoken,
That so much cost was but a certain token
Of his corruption? And that all the store
He wastes, was got by making ot^ers poor?
Or that the greatness of his new gained glory,
Is of the common wrong^ a real story?
Who prai^eth him for this? or who does call
Him honorable, wise, o^ l^berall.
For those expenses; but ^he rascal rabble
Of Coxcombs, and of G^lls, that haunt his table?
What honor is it? or what can it please,
To be the Lord of many Palaces?
To have their Cambers, and their Galleries
Adorned with most precious ^arities?
To feed, and cloth, and patronize a number
Of Parasites, and of Buffoones, to cum^er
Their w^lks and lodgings? To have every day
Their servants following them in rich array?
Rich stuffes, with rich embroyderies to bury,
To ride on princely charets? or to hurry
In gilt Caroches? or o^ pampered Steeds,
(From Turkey fetched, or from the Barbary breeds)
To p^aance about the streets to show their pride?
Or with vain titles to be magnified?
What pleasure is all this, when they shall hear,
How loud the clamou^ sounds in every ear,
Of their oppressions, ^rau^s, and cruelties?
And how the people curse their tyrannies?
Their state, and their ambition to maintain;
How many, oh! how many to complain
Conftrained are? Alas! how many a one
Have their proud followers tyrannized upon?
And of their servants, what great numbers too,
Do these by their ambitiousnesse undo?
The faces of the poorer sort they grind;
The bread of Orphans (who the while are pin^e)
They feed upon. The people they have sold
For old-worne shoes ^ on Altars they lay hold;
And, of each holy thing they m^ke their prey,
Whereon their sac^ilegiou^ hands they lay.
The portion of their brethren they devour;
And, by us^rping an unl^wfull power,
They save each other harmless from the laws;
And overthrow the poor complainants cause.
Their neighbors, often, and t^eir nearest friends,
(To who^ they daigne respect but for their ends)
Are so engaged to uphold their pride,
That they their foolish heads are feign to hide.
Some Tradesme^, for their vain credulity,
(In trusting to their H^nors) now do lie
Imprisoned for their aptn^sse to believe:
And, what they suffer, or how much they grieve,
Their Lordships care not: For (except their own)
Of all men's troubles they are sens^lesse grown.
Their houses, and their lodgings, every day*
Are full of Suitors, who as humbly pray
For what is their own, as if that they were some
Who to entreat for charity were come:
And often are answered with such harsh replies,
For their compelled impo^tunities,
As if it were an impudence or wrong,
To ask the debt which had been ^ue so long.
The Baker and the Butcher, sometime serve
Great men with bread and flesh until they sta^ve
Themselves almost: and, if they doubt they shall
Be quite undone before it so befall*
They often a^e glad to lose the sum that is due,
Through fear that for their own if they should sue,
(In stead of recompense) receive they might
Some evil turn, their boldness to requite.
For, some are grown so base, that now and than
Their Costermonger* yea their Butterman,
And Herbw^fe is half beggered and undone,
By suffering them upon their scores to run.
Oh! with what faces can these Tyrants ride
Along the streets, in such a h^ight of pride,
As often they do, when they are looked upon
By those poor Tradesmen whom they have undone?
What j^y have they to see, or to be s^ene
In those gay feathers, which have plucked been
From others wings; whose nakedn^sse appears
To cry aloud for Justice, in Gods ears?
And what a Plague is fallen on that L^nd
Where such as these have places of command?
Where t^ese are chose for Statesmen, what protecti^
Is Virtue like to find? what due correction
Has Vice where such control? or what is he
Can look for Justice, where such Judges be?
Would I could say, oh! Britain, thou have none
Of these Or else might name thee such a one,
As lawfully, as I might boldly do it,
For thy advantage, were I called to it.
But, that authority which I have got,
Checks faults alone, with persons meddles not.
Thy ancient Virtues are not wholly lost,
In all thy families. Yet, ^or the most,
As are thy Princes, now, thy Gentry be*
According to the height of their degree.
They spend their youth in lust and idleness;
In impudent p^ophanenesse, and excess;
In foolish complements; in thriftl^sse games;
And in oblivion do interre their Names:
Through want of knowledge, and that real worth
Which sets the luster of true Gentry forth.
The ma^kes of Gentle-blood, and that which praise
Did thereunto acquire, in fo^mer days,
Were Justice, Temperance, Courage, Prude^cy,
True Courtsie, Meekness, Liberality,
And such as these. Their Ex^rcises were
Those which the mind or body might prepare
For ve^tuous practices: as leaping, runn^ng,
To handle Arms, to shoot, to show their cunning
In m^naging great Horse; in studiousnesse
Of piety, and of the Sciences.
Which we term liberal. But now, alas!
The Gentry, Britain, is not as it was.
To be a Gentlem^n, is now, to we^re
Fant^stick habits, horrid oaths to swe^re;
To w^ifte Tobacco; to be drunk, and game;
To do a villainy, and boast the some.
To dare the Pox; to talk with impudence*
How often they had it, without grief or sense,
Of their misdoings; no^hin^ to pro^esse
Or p^acti^e, but to live (...);
To quarre^l; to be in^ole^t, and proud;
To che^t, and brag, and lie, and speak aloud
In stea^ of ^p^aking reason: to p^esume
Abov^ his wo^th; unwise^y to ^o^sume
Hi^ p^t^imony; fast and loose to play;
To borrow* without purposing to pay;
To spend their time in ^^uitless^ visi^ations,
In beastly and p^ophane communications;
In telling and in liftning after news;
In viewing idle sights, or haunting Stews;
With such like exe^cises: as if they
Were made to flutter all their time away
Like Butterflyes, and lived, pu^posely,
For nothing, but to eat, and drink, and dye.
Their noblest mark, is di^ting a brace
Ofhandsome Nags, to run a ^quitting Race.
Or keep^ng of a cast of Norway Kites,
To show them yearly half a dozen flights;
Or else, the feeding of a stinking pack
Of yelping Hounds; that when discourse they lack,
They may whole d^yes together, pra^e a story,
In which so^e Dogs, or Hauks, or Horses g^ory
^s m^gnifi'd; and him they c^unt a Clown,
That in their folly is no partner grown.
Oh! wou^d these lines had po'wr to make the^ see,
How fooli^h and absurd their cou^ses be:
And that my Muses now could reach the strain,
Might win them nobler t^oughts to ente^ta^ne.
But, mine will h^rdly prove such Charms, I fear;
For, at the very root we rotten are;
And, where our Maladies their cure should have,
The dangerou^ infections we receive.
Our Nurseries of Arts are not so pure,
But that in them our bane we may pr^cu^e.
Our Inn of Court have lost their good repute,
By ha^boring of persons ^issolute.
The ^chooles of Law are Sanctuaries made
For Out-lawes, and where once our Gentry had
That nurture which enobled them; now, ther^
By lewd examples, which too frequent are,
O^, by too great a liberty, we gain
A habit in ^ll courses tha^ are vain.
And most of those, of whom the world believes
Most good (among them) are but civil thieves.
For, Lawyers, and some Officers, in thee,
(Which Ministers of Justice seem^ to be)
Have made the Courts and Offices, whereby
We should of wrongs receive a remedy;
To prove to us things more uneasy, far,
Then those, for which their just complainings are.
So costly b^ their wild interpretations
Of Laws and Customs; and such variation^
Are found in their opinions, that few know
When they up^ightly, or in safety go.
If any Common Ba^reter will please
By suits u^just his neighbors to disease;
The Plea may be mai^tained, though that all
His allegations prove untrue they shall:
Or manifest, ^y d^u^tlesse demonstration,
He pu^pos^d nou^ht but wilful molesfation.
For, Lawy^rs will defend and plead the Cause,
Which to their knowledge does oppose both Jaws
And Conscience too; as if they did contemn
His threatenings that pronounced woe to them,
Who justify the wicked in their fin;
Or him gainsay which has not faulty bin.
Even in our Court of Conscience, some things are
Unconscionable. For, if any here
Be causlesly compl^^n'd on well is he
If uncondemn^d in the ^uit he be.
For, this Defen^ant h^th small r^medy,
Save that, an^ patience, for his injury.
His causl^sse trou^l^s, and his large expense,
Has no req^it^ll save his innocence.
For, if all they that are u^ju^tly grieved,
By h^^ing co^ts o^ suits should be re^^ved;
Or if the Plaintiff should his B^ll ave^re
Upon his oath, as every Answerer
Confirms his An^wer, many ^ brawling K^ive
Would then be quiet, and that Court would have
Far less employment: yea, and we^e it not
Their Trave^ses did knit again the knot,
Which Answers upon O^th, almost unty,
Suits would not h^lfe so long unended lie.
This, many Offi^ers do seem to fear;
And therefore (as if Courts erected were
To m^ke them rich, by n^urishing contention;
Much rat^er then to compass the prevention
Of wrongs and discord) they continue still,
That course which brings most grists unto their mil.
If I would m^ke a Libell, it should be
By way of Suit: f^r, I did never see
A scurrilous Rhyme or Pamphlet, so compact
O^ sl^n^ers (nor so cunningly derract)
As do their than-lesse Bills, and their Replies,
Who seek, that way, men's names to scandalize.
They dare p^etend (as if with warranty)
Those things of which no probability
Was ever seen. For, thou^h they prove it no^,
They kno^ the very mention of a blot
Does leave a sta^n^; and, that aspersions laid
Sup^osedly, are often so ^^nvaid,
And so dispersed; and in disperting, will
Such new additions g^the^ to them s^^ll;
That, at the last (althoug^ most fal^e they were)
For t^uths, they told and heard, of ma^y, are.
But, their I^tergatorie* have a trick
Beyond all other L^b^dings, to stick
An infamy on any: for, in those,
O^ ^ll which they will causl^sly suppose
W^thin their Bills; they may the qu^st^on move,
To whoms^ever they preten^ ^ shall prove
Wh^t they object And, t^ough no p^oofe be brought,
N^y, thoug^ it never came within his thought,
That is complai^'d against* to do or say
Those things which they object against him may:
Yet, he that is examined, or he
That ^eads what matters questioned of him be;
Suspects, perhaps, (although he nothing knew
Con^erning them) that every thing is true
Which their Intergat^ries do imply.
For, why thinks ^e (that means honestly)
Should Propositions of these things be made,
If they no likelihood of being ^ad?
Or w^o (suppose^h he) has so abhord
A mind, as to suggest, and on ^e^ord
To leave aspersions (o^ deserving blame)
O^ him, that no way merited the same?
Yet, this is frequent: and this li^elling
Much profit to their Common wealth does bring,
Who gain by others losses. And, there is none
O^ whom this mischief may not ^all upon.
For ^ne example ^f suc^ g^osse abuse,
My self I can, and justly may, p^oduce.
For, sitting lately in a room alone,
My own occa^^ons meditating on:
Two men, who talking at the door had bin,
(And, as appeared, knowing me within)
Ma^e entrance and besought me both to hear,
(And witness) what they had agreed on th^re.
I heard them; and, I purposed to do
As they requi^ed, being called thereto.
But, mark what ^ollow'd. Twelve months after that
The one of these (not well content with what
His b^rgaine wa^; and knowing, I alone
Could re^tifi^ wh^t they a^reed upon)
Did i^ this k^vish c^nn^ng wise project
To make my wi^nesse take the less effect.
Forsooth, ^e m^k^s me pa^ty in the cause;
A pitiful complaining Bill he draws;
Wherein his le^rned Counsel did devise
Such Combinations, and Conspiraci^s,
Such Plots, such Pra^tices* and such large tal^s,
Of Premises, of Bargai^i^gs* of Sales,
And such like Heathrish ^^uffe: and his pretense,
Was wo^ded out with so much impudence;
That, surely, whosoever came to see
That piece o^ Ch^uncery, supposed me
A very cheating Rascal: or, tha^ I
(At least) was privy to some knavery;
Whereas he knew, who then did so abuse me,
I blameless was of what he did accuse me.
Yea, then so far was I from any plot,
Or purposed wrong; that I had quite forgot
Both man and ma^ter: and, but for his Bill,
Had been (I think) unmin^full of them sti^l.
A wrong like this, if any please, he may
Inflict upon me every other day,
With safe impunity. For, such as he,
Entitled Am^^i Curiae be:
And, many thousand fees would quite be lost,
Were they* in such like suits, to bear the cost.
If I should here disclose what I have seen,
The p^actice of some Lawyers to have been;
What cunning in convey^nces they use,
How strangely their Profession they abuse*
And what a glory to themselves they take,
When they an evil cause to thrive can make:
Or, should I he^e character their Delays,
Their Errors, their Demurs, their many w^yes
Of hindering Justice; their impertinent
And costly ted^ous Forms; their impudent
Extorting from their Clients doubl^ fees;
For Motions, which they willingly d^e leese:
How they do move by halfes; how they mistake
(Of purpose) for themselves, new wo^k to make;
How often their Orders have by procrea^ion,
Made up, almost, the hundredth generation;
What double-tongu'd ^eports, for double fees,
Are gotten by cor^upted Referrees;
(Who when the truth is plain, can coin a doubt
To bring again the fals^st Cause about)
How sense less of men's losses, griefs, or pain,
They are in all things which concern their game;
To what expenses they their Clients bring;
How they do ride them in an endless Ring,
And prey upon them: or, if here I should
Disclose as evidently as I ^ould,
How full of wicked bribes, their closets be;
What brutish cruelti^^ mine eyes did see;
How many honest Causes I have known,
For want of prosecution, overthrown;
Because our tedious f^rmes of trial, stretch
Much further then the Clients purse can reach.
How many miles poor men are forced to come,
For trifling suits, which might have end at home;
But that our higher Co^rts more seek increase
Of t^eir base profits, then of blessed ^eace.
Should I relate, wi^h what strange tyrannies
Some Officers their places exercise;
What par^iality they show; what pride*
How they insul^ on men; how they d^ride;
How big they speak; how scur^ilous ^hey be,
In taunting and reviling men more free
From vice, then they themselves: Or* should I tell
How little tenderness does seem to dwell
Within their bosoms, when they do oppress
The needy w^dow, and the fatherl^ss^:
If all these things I should insist upon,
And so describe them, as they might be done;
The wo^ld would know that all those injuries,
For which the Law appoints remedies,
Are often less grievous to the Common weal,
Then most, w^o most pretend her sores to heal:
And that as little help from them she sees,
As when she sets her Cats to keep her Cheese.
For, some of them are trusty in their kind,
And so, some trusty Lawy^rs she may find:
Yea, those ^here be, that in these evil days,
Like Rubies mixed with peble^, send forth rays
Of Christian p^eties; which do declare,
That some remain who yet an honor are
To that prof^ssion; and all those are free
From being t^xt, or blamed here by me.
The rest shall bear their shame; for, they were bor^
To be our plague; and they shall be my scorn:
Their torments ^o afflict both night and day,
An^ there are few such tortu^ers as they.
For, of those wrongs which we by them sust^ine,
We scarcel^ a^e pe^mitted to complain.
Nor will this ^land better days be^old,
So long as Offices are boug^t and sold.
Nor shall I ever think that a^y one,
Much cares, what right or injury be done,
That buys or sels an Office; chiefly he,
Who chaffe^s that where seats of Judgment be.
For order s^ke, to ^hese my knee I bend;
Or, I to give them titles can descend,
And ev'^y outward reverence; that so
The pla^e they bear, con^emne^ may not grow:
Yet, nobler far he seems in mine eyes,
Who, by a due election, does arise
To be but Heardma^ in some Country Borrough,
Then all those Lordlings who have passed thorough
The greatest Office^, by giving pay;
Or by some other unapproved way.
When me^ were sou^ht, that Office they might beat
And had it gratis* they such persons were,
Whose wo^t^, whose vertue^, and whose nobleness,
Bro^gh^ ho^or to the seats they did po^sesse.
With faithfulness, their du^ies they discharged,
No ancient fee unjustly was enlarged;
Or n^w extorted; neither did they take
The poor man's money, when he moan did mak^:
For, by an easy entrance they were able
(When need required) to be charitable.
Their just expenses, also, to provide;
And to sust^ine a comely port b^side.
But, since men sought out Offices; and thought
Of their own merits, better then they ough^,
(Int^uding, without modesty, to sit
Upon that Seat, ^or which they were u^fit)
Since men expe^ienced (by serving long
In some inferior places) ha^ such wrong,
Tha^ ignorant Impostors got possession
O^ what pertaines to them, by due su^cession:
Yea-since to sac^ed Calling^ men are chose
By them, that should not of such ^hin^s dispose;
What can e're long expected be, u^lesse
It be an overflow of Barbarous^esse?
Since each base fellow (who, perhaps, by steal^h,
By fraud, or by extortion, scrape^-up wealth)
May pu^cha^e, by his evil gotten pel^e,
A place o^ honor, to ens^once himself,
And fortify his wickedness withal;
What hope of good proceedings follow shall?
Since needy, worthless, base, and shamel^s grooms,
May se^ue their persons into noble rooms,
By means ignoble; no man must exp^ct
From such a Cause, to draw a good Effect;
Or, that he honor gets, who in such times
To any honorable title climbs.
He'^ but a thief, that in at window comes;
The buyer sells, and sells ^or greater sums;
By bribery, he bribery defend^,
Of unjust Mammon he does make him friends,
To nourish Pride; or else to make up that,
W^ereby possession of his pl^ce he gat;
Without compassion, he does grieve, oppress,
And rack the widow, and the fatherless:
All places* and all things that appertain
To every place, he put^ to sale, for gain:
Yea, most men of each other, now, m^ke sale:
Of their own liberties, of lives, and all.
Great Offi^ers pretending to the gift
(...) some inferior places, make a shift
^o save the giving, and, so dearly sell
That their poor underlings they often compel
To serve without allowance; or to raise
Their maint^nance, by some unlawful ways:
Which they must co^ntenance; or else contrive
That others at such doing^ may connive.
Whereby those places held disg^acefull be,
Which, otherwi^e, from scandal, had bin free.
Why then reproach we such with odious names,
Since they that are the author^ of then shames,
(And those to whom base te^me^ do appertain)
Are their great Mast^rs, who make wicked gain
Of what should ^reely be bestowed on those
To whom they ought such places to di^pose?
From them, and their corruption, does arise
The multitudes of base enormities
That swarm among our petty Officers.
It is a sum ^f money that prefe^s
To every place; and that makes knaves, and sharks,
Of Sergeants, Waiters, and of Vnder-clarks.
This makes Registers, in every Court,
And other Ministers, so much extort:
This makes them seek out knots, demurs, delays,
And practice many unapproved ways,
To make up that which ^oolishly they paid:
Yet, in the grave, their heads, perhaps, are laid
Ere half recovered be: and often their wives,
(Whose portion bought those places for their lives)
Are le^t, with many ch^ldren, to a lot
Unpitied, as they others pitied not.
For, many a one of these, although you see
Their wives and children in apparel be
As costly as a Lords (that yea^ly may
Dispend as great a sum, as these did pay
For their new Offices) engaged are
To Usurers, for twice the better share
Of their large Fines: and, sometime they undo
Themselves, their kindred, and their neighbors too.
Hence comes it, that Receivers, Bailifes, Reeves,
And other such, are worse then common thieves;
And ^ack and pill so boldly; and from hence
It flows, that few suppress their insolence:
Even from their base corruption, who do thrive
By such men's loss; and not alone connive
At their misdoings, but, often patronize them,
And from just censures an escape devise them.
For they that else would Furze and Brambles burn^,
Will cherish them, where they may save their co^ne.
Thus, Britain, most of them have used thee,
Whose Offices, by purchase, gotten be.
These, and a multitude of other crimes,
They cause, and act, and suffer in these times:
And are so insolent in what they do,
That they dare practice, and defend it too,
Without remorse of mind, or seeming sense
Of being guilty of the least offense.
Nor come thy Priests or Prophets much behind
The worst of these: but, pass them in their kind.
For, though a learned Clergy thou possessest,
And every day in knowledge much increasest:
Although I do believe thou have in thee
Those Guides whose ways are from reproof as free
As are the best on earth: yet, thou have more
That are perverted, now, then heretofore.
Of late, thou heaps of Teach^rs gotten have,
Resembling empty vapors, or a blast
That breathes no comfort. What God never meant
They publish fo^th; and come e're they are sent.
Thy peoples hurts, they cure with sugared speech;
W^^n there is no peace at all, of peace they preach;
Thou pu^bl^nd Watchmen have, and some that see,
As blindly walk, as they that blindest be.
Dumb Dog^ thou have, who spend their time in sleep;
And, some who bark, but to affright the sheep.
Like hungry Curres, some always gurmandize;
Yet nothing can their greedin^sse s^ffice.
They follow their own wills, and their own ways
They hunt for their own profit, their own praise.
They tread the p^ths where common sinne^s wal^e;
Amongst themselves, they most profanely talk;
And, at the Tavernes meet, and sit and ^will
Strong drink, and wine* until their guts they fill.
In taking Gifts, and compassing Promotion,
They show more zeal, and practice more Devotion
Then in their holy Callings. They delight
In Flatterie^; and the fawningst Parasite
In all the Cou^ts of Europe, cannot prate
More Heathnishly, nor more ^nsinuate
Then some of them. The blessed Sacraments
And holy Word, are used as inst^uments
To compass that, for them, which they projected;
And often polluted are, and of^ negl^cted.
Their sacred Orders, are abused and made
To serve them for an Office, or a Trade,
To be in^iched by; and to that end
The preaching of the Gospel, they intend.
They come not ^y the door into the fold;
Things holy, they have often ^oug^t and sold;
Conspiraci^s they m^ke in matters foul;
They prey upon the body and the soul;
And, fat and rich, and mighty to become,
They daub and plaster with untemper'd ^ome.
With lies, and fair pretenses they beguile;
And violate the Law of God, the while.
His Altars they profane, they sla^ve his flock;
They make Religion but a mocking-flocke;
And, by examples horrible and vile,
Cause other men, Gods Temples to defile.
There is no avarice which theirs exceeds;
No malice which a mischief sooner breeds:
No pride so sutly as their Clergy-pride,
Except among the Beggars, when they ride.
They, who but few years past, would h^lfe have broke
Their kindreds, to have purchased them a cloak;
And in poor thread bare Cassocks sought to preach
Beneath an Vnder-Curate; or to teach
The chil^ren of some Farmers, for their meat:
And seemed scarce worthy so much grace to get,
Until by counte^f^it humility,
(By fawni^g mixed with importunity,
And g^lt with fained zeal) they wr^ught on some;
To bring their wandering feet into their home.
Even some of these, so well have acted out
Their part^, of seeming honest and devout;
That (either like to Micahs Priest, by leaving
Their Patrons; and their hopeful trust dec^iving:
Or, some such likely ways) they have acquired
A ^i^her st^tion, then they first desired.
They have so quaintly humored, and so pleased
T^^ present times; that, they have proudly s^ized
Supremest places: and, now, over peer
Their heads by whom, they first a^vanced were.
And v^ry profit^ble, sure it is,
To heed them, since their met^mo^^^^s^s.
For, if thou mark, how stately now they bear
Their lofty heads; how insolent they are;
How pitilesse to suitors they become;
With what contempt poor men be rated from
Their angry presence; what imperious Lords
Their Docto^ships are grown; what haughty words
They thunder forth; what Antichristian state
They take upon them; how extreme ingrate
And inhumane they prove (even unto those
By whom, they from the dunghill first ^rose)
Were well observed how strangely they contemn
Their ancient friends; and twixt themselves, and them,
What distances they set; or, to their kin
How harsh and evil natured they have bin;
(Except to those, that having means to rise
As well as they, their folly do despise.)
Were known, what self opinion they have got
Of their own worths; how they themselves besot
With arrogance; how peevish, and unquiet
They be in their attendance, and their diet;
In small or trifling matters how severe;
In those which of the greatest moment are,
How careless grown: how envious of the grace
O^ gifts bestowed on those, in meaner place.
Were notice also taken, with what strain
Of p^ide and loftiness, they entertain
Their brethren of the Clergy, when they are
By any summons called to appear
before their Lordships; with what Pope like phrase
They seek to terrify, and to amaze
Their humble Suppliants, with what balde conceits
They v^nt their humors, that the crew which waits
To claw and sooth such follyes, may begin
(In ^tead of some applause) to fleere, and grin.
How tar^ly they can chide, and rail, and play,
And jest on those, who but the other day
Did equal them in tempr'all dign^ties;
And are more worthy, though less high they rise.
Were these things heeded, and some passages
Which name I could, as worthy note as th^se;
A man would har^ly think, that these had been
Those Priests, who but a while before were seen
So be^gerly, and so exposed to scorn;
But, that, they had (at least) been Prelates borne.
None could have thought that these me^ had bin they
Who lately did so bitterly invey
Against the pride Episcopal; and plained,
To see themselves so slighted, and disdained
Of their superiors: no man would ^ave thought
These had bin poor men's children, who had naught
To give them nurture; or, that they, bereft
Of all their friends, were to the parish left.
None would believe, almost, that any such
Should from so little, rise to have so much
In such a Calling; and so wo^thlesse be
In their condition: for, it seems to ^e,
They little con^cience make of that Prof^ssion,
Whereby they have those glories in possession:
Since then (me thinks) so ^ar they would not swerve
From his pure word, whom they pretend to serve.
Oh! pray that God would mak^ thos^ watchmen see
What blots and errors in their c^urses be.
And, that, by good example they may teach,
What they by word, unto the people preach:
For, by their actions* many overthrow
The growth of that, which they themselves did sow.
Or by their failing, or their falling f^^m
A Christan zeal, make others cold ^ec^me.
And, some of these are those, of whom Christ says,
We should embrace their words, but not their ways.
But, many a one will neither say nor do,
What we may follow, or give heed unto.
Yea, we have now among us many a one,
(That could have spoken well) whose voice is gone,
By growing over fat with double Cures:
And pampring up themselves like Epicures.
How many Doctors have we, who before
They were advanced, from conditions poor,
Were glad and willing twice each Sabbath day,
To preach, and all the public prayers to say?
Yea, without any show of being weary,
The Sacraments to give; to wed, to bury,
And, often in the week, those works to do,
Which by their Calling they were bound unto?
Of those how many in these days are seen,
That having to promotion raised been,
Are well nigh silenced, now performing neither
Of all those duties, for whole months together?
Of these, how many lately have I known,
So proud (or else perhaps so lazy grown)
To cast upon their hirelings all that care,
And all that pains, which they themselves should bear?
Vouchsafing not so much as once a day,
(Though they are present) public prayers to say;
Or preach; or, of the dutie^ to be done,
To ease their Curate, in performing one?
But (sitting as mere strangers, or as he
Who thought such works, for him too mean to be)
Take ease and state upon t^em; more I wis,
Then either needful or beseeming is.
Indeed (when they are any way engaged
By public studies, weak, or sick, or aged)
Sometime to ease themselves, deserves no blame:
But having no excuse, it is their shame.
How unbeseeming is it, to behold
Our Doctors, who nor crazy are, nor old,
Nor any way disabled, save through sloth,
Or through their pride (or else perchance through both)
To leave that charge to some inferior one,
Which is too worthy, to be undergone
By him that is worth'est, in respect of all
Those dignities, the world afford them shall?
Why should the adding of a new Degree,
Or la^ger means (which no additions be
To their essential wor^h) make wise men seem
So highly praised, in their own esteem,
As to debase that work, for whose mere sake,
Gods mercy them so eminent did make?
For, if it were not so, why do they more
Neglect those duties now, then heretofore?
Why, in performing them, respect they so
The times, and persons, as we see they do?
At solemn feas^s, or in those places where
Most honorable personages are,
Why do they preach more often? why baptize,
And wed, and bury, where their living lies,
The richer fort, and let the poor alone;
If what they do, for conscience sake be done?
Ala^! preferment, and the being rich,
Does choke up virtues, and the mind bewitch,
The daughter sleights the mother. For, Devotion
Brought forth by painful travel, fair Promotion;
And lo, no sooner is Preferment borne,
But, proud she grows, and does her Mother scorn.
They who d^d much sor little; now, possessing
A great abundance, do requite the blessing
With doing less, in stead of doing more;
And, mar with pride, what pain did plant before.
The greater favors we from God receive,
The greater thankfulness we should conceive.
Yea, when that he advances us most high,
We should express the more humility;
And think, that even the meanest circumstances
Belonging to his holy Ordinances,
Could not with reverence enough be done,
When we have all our worthiness put on.
And, doubtless, when to God most high we raise
Our hands, in offering up his public praise,
The man (in my opinion) fitteth best
That work; who seems more worthy then the rest.
And, whosoever should that act eschew,
(Except just cause within himself he knew)
I know (how high soever his place has bin)
His Calling is dishonored therein:
Or, if to be assistant he does shun,
When any priestly work is to be done,
Where he has Cure: for, into others rooms,
To make intrusion, no man it becomes.
God grant those men humility, and care,
Who otherwise, in this, affected are;
And show o^r Clergy what uncomelinesse
Appears in this. For, some herein transgress
By other men's examples; and indeed,
Some other men, by want of taking heed
Of what they do; who having weighed the fact,
Will never put the same, again, in act.
Lord waken these; and, humble those, I pray,
Whom pride, or vanity have led astray.
And oh! ye house of Levi, warning take ye;
Lest God, for times to come, examples make ye,
As he that Clergy, your example made,
Whose monstrous pride, the age before you, had
So great a fall. Oh! mind it, and be more
Regardfull of your Charge then heretofore:
Lest they that spite the Churches dignities,
(And of her Dowry seek to make a prize)
For your ambitious pride, occasion take,
On Gods Inheritance, their pr^y to make.
So will our Clergy, which is yet respected,
Be scorned, become as poor, and as neglected,
As in those Countries, where their former pride
Has made their Calling to be vilifide.
Oh! leave, oh! leave your haughtiness betimes,
Your avarice, your envy, and those crimes,
That are observed among you; left for them
God shake the wall of our Jerusalem.
For, heaven and earth for me shall testify,
That this my Muse in nothing does belie.
Your manners; but that you are mo^e then stained,
With every fault whereof I have complained.
And as it was their Priests and Prophets sin
That brought the Deluge of those troubles in,
Which overwhelmed the Jewish Commonweal:
So, if with us the Lord severely deal,
Your sins and errors will enlarge the rent,
Through which the mortal arrow shall be sent,
That deepest wounds. Oh! God defend us from
Such judgments; or, if thou be pleased they come,
Upon our sinful bodies strike the blow;
And keep us from a spiritual overthrow.
Excuse me worthy Prelates; and all you
Whom God with la^ge preferments does endue,
And raise to honor, out of low degrees,
Because ingrafted in your hearts he sees
Such inward virtues, and such outward graces,
As do become your high and holy places;
Excuse me if in ought delivered here,
Injurious to your worths I may appear:
For, not a Line of these reproving strains,
To you or any one of your pertaines;
Nor need you cure, if any shall apply,
These tart reproves, to blur your Callings by:
Because you know, that none are this way harmed,
Who are by true and real virtues armed.
Because you also know, that some have shamed
Your pl^ces by such ^^imes as I have named.
I know you will not frown, though I did say,
That some of Christ's Disciples would betray
Their Master to his foes. Since this no more
Redounds to your disgrace, then heretofore
It did to his Apostles, that he said
How he by one of them should be betrayed.
None tax you shall, by means of this, but heady
And hairebrain'd fools, that are your foes already;
Nor would I for the world unloose my tongue,
To do the Virtuous, or your Calling wrong.
Let no man gather hence, my Muse envies
The Clergy, or the reverend Dignities
To them pertaining; or dislike to see
Great Prelates raised up from low degr^e:
For, them I honor most, who from a race
Of mean esteem, have gained an honored place,
By true desert. And (might I be as able
As willing) I would make more honorable
Their holy Callings; and for ever close
Their greedy mouths, and bind the hands of those
Who speak, or act, what might infringe their due,
Who in those places good examples show.
I know, among our Bishops, there are some,
Who make their outward honors to become
A means to keep Religion, and their Calling,
From being vilified, and from falling
Into contempt: of S^iles account they make not,
For their own glory: to themselves they take not
Their Lordly Attributes; but to adorn
Their Office, and to keep the same from scorn.
Some such there are: and for the sakes of such
It is, that yet our Clergy has so much
Of that esteem which our forefathers left them;
And that these greedy times have not bereft them
Of those endowments which were granted here
When Kings the Churches nursing Fathers were.
From these reprooses, let such therefore be free;
And fall the blame on those that faulty be.
But, as the Shepherds have deserved the strokes
Of Gods displeasu^e; so their wanton Flocks
The same have merited; and, blame there lies
On all conditions, and fraternities.
I would not speak what might offend the Throne
Of Justice; or the King that fits thereon.
From all taxation let him escape as free
As he is innocent; yea let him be
Untouched: and, let every virtuous Peer,
Be free from all, that shall be spoken here:
For, I will aim at none, but whom it shall
Become an honest Muse to chide withal.
In this, believe me Readers. For, I pray
Forgive my bluntness. And I dare to say
The Court is fraught with bribery, with hate,
With envy, lust, ambition, and debate;
With fawnings, with fantastic imitation,
With ^hamefull sloth, and base diffimulation.
True Virtue's almost quite exiled ^hence,
And vice with vice, for chief pre-eminence
M^intaineth w^rs. The most profuse Excess,
And Avarice, one bo^ome often possess:
The greater part are of a Mushroome breed,
Spring up upon a sudden, without seed,
Or plant, or graft, and, often, in one day,
(Yea som^time in a moment) swept away.
With lies, they seek their Sover^igne to delight;
And act their impudences in his sight.
They flay the people, an^ their flesh they tear
Even from the bones; as does a greedy Bear.
They cannot broo^ the mention of their error;
They drive out of their minds the day of ter^or.
Deep pits, to hide their mischiefs in, they m^ke;
And think that God no heed of them will take.
They live upon the Commons; and yet grow
More fat, then others in enclosures do
And, that which follows t^eir increasing power,
Is but to be devoured, or devour.
Their wealth consists of Projects: their esteem
Is that which they to one another seem.
Their Honors are bare Titles; and, that state
Which they themselves do fancy and create.
Their Ze^le is wilfulness. Their Faith is such
As Reason breeds; and, most times, not so much.
Their Hope is something, but I know not what.
Their Charity is nothing; or else that
Which I should call Self-love. Their Strength i^ in
Opinion* and in ableness to sin.
Their Wisdom, and their Policy, (if we
May guess at things that undiscerned be)
Is to resolve on nothing: so, the Foe
Shall never compass their designs to know.
Their Courtesy (if men will be content
To think it may consist in Complement)
Is wondro^s great. Their Valor is in oaths.
Their greatest Glory does depend on clothes;
In which they are so vain, that every morn
(Almost) a new attire by some is worn,
Of several stuffes or fashions: and they dress
Their bodies, with such tedious curiousness,
And, such a multitude of hands there are
To tr^m them (and their trappings to prepare)
That half so many, of good workmen, may
Erect a house, e're they themselves array.
Of Honesty they scarce the name afford:
For, should I term one, there, an honest Lord;
It might be thought as clownish, so to do,
As it were fal^e, perhaps, to call him so.
Gods holy Sabbaths, most among them, there,
Observe not much; except it be to wear
Their finest clothes. The Bus'nesses, that may,
And should be done upon some other Day,
Are then debated on, as frequently,
As those affairs which by necessity
Are urged upon them. And, all sorts of men
(When they should serve their God) are forced then
To wait upon the world; to whom God gave
Six days; for every one which he should have.
Nor, thereby, many other men's unrests
Occasi^n they alone; but, even their beasts
Are then disquieted; and cannot have
That right, which both Gods Laws, and Natures, gave*
Sometime, they to remove, that Day, prepare;
Yea* then begun, sometimes; Removalls are;
And in the Court, more Carters, we may see
Employed that day, then through the Kingdom be.
On Sun^ayes far more Coaches rumble thither,
Then do in some three other days together:
And, seldom have they leisure for a Play,
O^ Mask, except upon Gods Holy Day.
I do not think we are obliged to
A Jewish Sabbath, as great numbers do:
But sure I am, from Piety we swarve,
Unless a Christian-one we do observe.
And, though to them no fault it may appear,
Who on such Evenings do but only hear
Or (for their honest recreation) view
The action of some Interlude, or Show;
Yet, needs it must be known, to some of these,
That to prepare for such Performances,
To many persons must occasions be
Of Sabb^th-bre^king in a high degree.
In whom this fault most lies, as yet, my Muse
Descrieth not: bu^, sure I may excuse
The King: and if but half ^o forward were
Those Clergy men that have his royal ^are,
To cause him such enormities to see;
As they are thought in other things to be
Which less concern them; he would soon fo^bid
Those customs; and as Nehemiah did,
More hallowed make the Sabbath. Nay if none
O^ them, whose wisdom he d^pendeth on,
In this have mis-inform'd him; he will prov^
O^r Nehemiah, and this fault remove,
When he has warmed his Thro^e: for we have hope
That all our Breaches he e're long shall stop.
But leaving him, I Will finish the repo^t
Which fits the greater number in the Co^rt.
Religion they have some, but many care not
I^ ^he^e the use or mention of it were not:
Some others have divided it between
Our gracious Sov'raigne, and his royal Queen;
And, till in one Religion they agree,
They stand resolved, that they will Neuters be.
Oh! make betwixt them, Lord, a blessed Union,
And, us partakers of thy blessed Communion.
Our Cities are as wicked as the Court;
Of he^ transgressions they come nothing short:
But, rather pass them; if a man might say
That Infinites admit exceeding may.
And, London, thou thy Sisters all have passed,
In all the faults, whereby they have transgressed:
To thee alo^e, my speech I therefore bend,
And will in ^hine their follies reprehend.
I know that thou have many souls in th^e,
Who truly zealous of Gods glory be:
Yea, thousands that by prayers and repenting,
Do seek thy peace, and labor the preventing
Of thy perdition; and, though they endure
Scoffs, t^unts* and injuries, from thy impure
And faithless^ Children ^yea, though such as are
Thy shame, and m^rk^ Gods heavy wrath to bear,
Contemn and malice those, and use their power
Those innocents to ruin^ and devour:
Yet, they are those who keep away Gods wrath;
And for whose sakes be ^o long spared thee has.
They make that pl^asing Number, who restrain
Those flames of Sulphur, that consumed the plain
Which now the Lake Asphaltis overflowes.
And when (from out of thee) God calls for those,
Thou feel it shall; and, not unlike become
Those Asian Churches, which departed from
Their ancient love* and are the loathsome den
Of Satyrs, Faries, and of Beasts unclean.
A place for Zim, and Iim; a nest for Owls,
Night Ravens, Vultures, and ill-boding Fowls.
And, then, in every house (as heretofore,
When popish-darknesse spread this Kingdom over)
Men shall be frighted with strange dreadful noises;
Deformed visions, and hobgoblin voices.
I know, Good-works in ^hee are to be found;
And that, above the rest, thou do abound
In public Charities. I know thou have
All Cities, in this Kingdom, over-past
In plentifully preaching of Gods word;
And, that thou bountifully do afford
Large voluntary pensions to that end.
(Yea, somewhat else I might in thee commend.)
But, if thou take a note of thy transgr^ssions*
If thou at thy Assizes, at thy Sessions,
Or, at thy other Courts, observe, or hear,
How many horrid crimes detected are;
How many filthy and abhorred things,
God there discloses, and to Judgment brings;
And if thou think, withal, how many m^^
Committed are, which few do come to know.
Or heededst thou how few, and worthless, all
Those works appear, which thou do Virtues call*
What would they seem, compared to thy sin?
Or to those favors, which have heaped bin,
By God, upon thee? Does he owe thee ought,
Or have thou done him services for naught?
Oh! LONDON, has he not advanced thee
The Mistress, and the Sovereign to be
Of all the Towns, and Cities of this I Will?
Has he not raised thee many a goodly pile?
Art not thou placed above, and they below?
Continuing blessings does he not bestow?
And many privileges, yet, denied
To all the Buroughs of the Land beside?
Behold, thou have the principallest Trade,
And all their Merchants are thy Chapmen made:
Thou art the Royal Chamber of the King;
Whose residence does wealth and honor bring
To magnify thy greatness. Kept in thee
His Parliaments, and Courts of Justice be.
Among the famoust Cities under heaven,
God has to few a situation given
For pleasure, health, and profit, well united,
To thee compared* Yea, God did seem delighted
In thee to make his Dwelling (even among
Thy Temples) by maintaining here so long
His Harbengers, and Ledgers, to provide
Fit mansions, for his Graces to reside.
Thy God, to be thy Hu^band, thou have had;
And, were by him a fruitful Mother made,
So plenti^ull in Child^en; that, they play
Like swarms of Bees, about their hives, in May.
No place in Europe, has been so supplied
With soul and bodies food; or, fortified
By Garrisons, Forts, Bulwarks, and munition,
As thou art hitherto (by Gods tuition)
Without such charge or trouble. And the day
Will come, wherein, if any man shall say
What peace thou had; and, in what plenty ^ere
Thy Children lived (without want or fear)
It will not be believed, that a Nation
So blessed, could suffer such an alteration.
For, as (by Seas) from every other part
Of Earths vast circuit, thou enclosed art:
So, from the sudden coming of invasions,
And from the many troubles and occasions
Of Wars and wants, which in the world, we see;
Divided, also, these do seem to be.
Such is thy blessed condition; and, although
Thou have, about thee, of all things enough,
That may thy pleasure, or thy need suffice;
Yet, all the dainties and the rarities,
The World affords, are yearly hither sent,
From every quarter, of Earths Continent.
Oils, wines, and fruits, that good and pleasant are,
Swim hither through the Straights of Gibraltar.
Cold Norway, (or the parts adjoining) g^eets
Thy River with materials for thy Fleets.
America does often renew thy store
With Sugar, drugs, with gold and silver Ore;
With Ambergreece; with woods that sweetly smell;
And other things, that please thy ^ancy well.
Ormus, with Pearl thy beauties does adorn,
The Silks of Persia, in thy st^eets are worn.
From diverse parts of Africa, (and from
Cham's lineage there) white Ivorie does come;
And Apes and Fe^thers. China, where they printed,
And used Guns, ere we those Arts invented,
(If Friars be not liars) does impart
The f^uits of their Inventions, and their Art,
To thy Inhabitants. Ra^e stones o^ price,
Sweet smelling gummes, and odoriferous spice,
Are broug^t unto thee ma^y thousand miles;
Even from ^he Eastern Indies, and their Isles.
This shows Gods bounty: and of his compassion
Thou lately had, (even by thy preservation,
In thy great Plagues remove; and by his pity
Vouchs^fed otherways, unto thy City)
Such evidence: that all men may confess
He did respect thee, with much tenderness.
What should I mention more, since, to recount
God^ benefits would doubtlessly amount
To many Volumes? and sure none is able
To number that which is ina^merable?
This may suffice (for this time) to express
His Bounty, and thy great unthankfulness.
For, what have thou returned him, ^or these.
And all those ^lessings, which his Love does please
To shower upon thee? What have thou repaid
For all the Charges which he has defraid,
(In fencing, planting, and manuring thee)
That worthy, such a Husbandman, may be?
Thou have faire-seeming Grapes, I must confess,
But, they are sour, and full of rottenness.
Thou make great show of charitable works;
But, that hypocrisy within them lurks,
Which marrs their acceptance. Thou have built
Some Churches; yet, art tainted by the guilt
Of Sacrilege: and, those thy gifts that eary
The pioust shows have ^earce been voluntary.
Great numbers, in thy Hospitalls are fed,
And lodged, and cured: but, the men are dead
Who founded them; and few do bring supply
To such good works, till they are sick, or dye.
Thou entertainest Proachers, but they must
Speak pleasing things; or else away are thrust.
Thou have of Pastors, some who shows do make
Of so much Conscience, that they will forsake
Their Livings rather then it shall be said
They Will wear a Surplesse: yet, some are afraid,
That most of these, do cunningly conceal
Much pride or avario^ beneath their zeal,
And that their suff^ing of a silencing,
Does much more liberty or profit bring,
Then two good Pers^nages: and that, thereby,
Good meaning folk are brought to beggary.
Thou have redeemed some Captives; but, it was
With sparingnesse, and hardly brought to pass.
Thou plantest Colonies; but, thou do dra^ne
The nourishment away, that should maintain
And settle them. God grant some be not gl^d
To fly (for this) to them, that should have had
More help from thee, and in far Countri^s peris^,
Because those plants they did no better nourish.
Much know thy people; but (alas) they do
As if good life belonged not thereunto.
Strict Gospellers thou have, that can profess
Religion, with much for^all holiness:
But they, like Zodoms apples, prove within
As loathsome, as their ou^sides ^aire have bin.
Yea, they (against their brethren) often are found
In hate, and poisonous malice to abound.
Good Orders, Laws, and Customs thou have many;
But, very seldom exercisest any,
Except for private gain; or to acquire
Some Vengeance, which thou do, perhaps desire.
Thou have judicial Courts, wherein I (heeding
Their Laws) saw promises of just proceeding:
But, marking well their Forms, they seemed, rather,
Devices for thine Officers, to gather
Rich fortunes by; then to afford redress
For those, whom their oppressors do oppress.
Thou have a Magistracy, to maintain
The peace of honest men; and, to restrain
The rage of wickedness: but, lo; even some
Of those are patrons of mis-rule become;
Disturbing quiet men, and thriving by
Befriending sin; else I have heard a lie.
Yea, some are famed, to increase their living,
By cunning rig^ur, mixed with conniving:
Deceiving honest people, by strict shows
Of punishing of those whom they excuse.
For when by doing Justice they compel
A wicked man beyond their bounds to dwell,
(Some think) their grief, and loss, it does augment,
As much as losing of a Tenement.
Thou have Correction-houses; but, thou mende^t
Not many, whom to chasten thou p^etendest:
For, thither they are oftener ^ent to ease thee
Of them, or of their pilfrings, which disease thee;
Then out of Christian purposes, to force
Such vagrant people to a better course:
And, therefore are thy Suburbs pestred now,
With beggars; yea, for that, so large does g^ow
The number of thy vagrant Rogues, and Cheaters,
That they begin to imitate their betters,
In Government, and Method: and, are grown
To have both Laws, and Language, of their own.
Thy Children yield some good conformity
To Rules and Precepts of Morality:
But, most observe good orders, to enjoy
Their own state safe, and to prevent annoy
That might be^ide themselves; much ^ather, then
In true obedience unto God, or men.
Within thy Corporation, I likewise
Have notice taken of Societies,
Which be^re a goodly show of ordering
Thy several Trades: and I in many a thing
Their use commend: yet, some of them, to me,
Gross Monopolies, do appear to be.
Which do in secret, with some open shows
Of public good, the public weal abuse.
Nor would it be a^isse, if some things were
M^re free, which by their means restrained are:
Or if the State would better look unto
Those injuries, which many of them do.
For, when these Bodies politic oppress,
Their power does make the wrong without redress*
Their purses, and continuance, may o'rebea^e
The righ^full'st cause (if so they pleased are)
The friends, and often, the very noise they will make,
(Because a multitude) much hold does take
For their advantages; although the cause
Be both against good Consci^nce, and the Laws.
Nay, should the Common^weal^h her self, oppose
These Corporations, for some wrong that flows
From their proceedings; it would scarce obtain
That power which could these Petty-weales restrain.
For, having gain or loss, accrewing by
Their Claim, which does concern the^, far more nigh,
Then that, often seems to touch those men, who stand
To take the Kingdoms general cause in hand,
It makes them t^ pursue it, more then they;
More Patrons to procure, more bribes to pay;
And, at the last, to conquer* by that course,
Which makes the better cause to seem the worse.
This brings to mind same wrongs that I have had,
And what a^count of honest suits is made,
If once a greedy foolish multitude
Upon the right of any does intrude.
But, left by thinking on it, mix I may
My private harms, with what I meant to say
For public ends: here breathe I will a space,
Until my present thoughts I can displace.
Forgive me, Lord, if I have guilty been
In this my work, of any private spleen.
My Musings h^llow thou; confirm thy love:
Infuse me with thy Spirit from above,
With better things then flesh and blood discernes;
Inspire me with each Ve^tue which concerns
The finishing of what I undertake:
Make profitable all that I shall speak.
And, to thy Name some honor let it be,
Although it should both shame and ruin me.
The seventh Canto.
First, of Himsel^e he somewhat speaks:
Then, of the Cities errors, makes
A larger Scrowle, and, therewith^ll
Inserts abuses general.
He sh^wes (by reason of her sin)
What misery this Land is in;
What ill success, and what dishonor,
Is, for her follies, come upon her,
In foreign parts, and here at home:
How senseless, also, she is become:
What several ways against this Land,
God has of late stretched out his hand.
And, how the blame for what is amiss,
From one to th'o^her shift^d is.
By many Symptoms, he declares
How sick this Commonweal appears;
Disputes ^he late distemper bred,
Be^wixt the Body and the Head:
And lays the blame, where lie i^ should;
Yet, therein, proves not over-bold.
T^en aims he at some imperfections
In Burgesses, and their Election^;
And, briefly points at the way
By which our Cure effect we may.
WHen I (whose lawfully emboldned Muse
The faults and errors of her time pursues)
Have by some slips, or frailties of mine own,
Alaid that flame, which Gods good Sp'rit has blown;
Or when such heat within me, waxes less
By fainting, through a natural wea^inesse;
Or, by that willing, or constrained pause,
Whereof my friends, or bu^^nesses, are cause:
At such a time, when I perusal m^ke
Of these beginnings; and, strict notice take
What here is dared; I often find, as then,
Such fears in me, as move in other men.
And, being flesh and blood, as frail as they,
I stagger in my best approved way.
E're I thus far proceeded, I was tired,
Even in this present Work (although inspired
With all that zeal thereto, which you may see
In some foregoing Leaves, expressed by me)
My heart was often assailed; and I, almost,
My best confirmed Resolutions lost.
Yea, twice, at least, since I this Task assaid,
It has by false suggestions been delaid:
And, many painful strivings are within me,
When from this Work, Temptation fights to win me.
Lord! (thinks my heart) sometimes, what means my Soul
To make me in this desperate wise control
Those careless Times? have I done well or no,
With nests of angry Waspes to meddle so?
Has he, or wit, or common sense, that stirs,
A f^oward Bear? or plays with testy Curs?
Will any think me capable of Reason,
Thus bold to be at such a dangerous season?
Nay, will not all account me mad to vent
Such Lines as these? adventuring to be shent,
And be undone, perhaps, to no more end,
Then that whereto my Labor seems to tend?
Do I conceive the Times, or Manners, be
Amended ought, by what is said by me?
Am I, that have, my self, unwisely done,
A fitting man, to hurl this heavy stone
At other sinners? what may many say,
But that in this I rail, or else do play
The witless Fury? It has brought me loss,
(Think I) already; and will surely cross
The settling those affairs of mine, which are
Nigh rip'ned, with much pain, expense, and care.
And then the world, and my necessities,
Begin to tempt me, by such fallacies,
That I half yield. How will thou live, or pay
Where thou engaged art? they seem to say.
By what, or whence, thy wants will thou supply,
If thou for this imprisoned should lie,
Divided from thy friend^? or, on the bed
Of sickness, should by God be visited?
Nay, though thou nothing want; yet thou ha^t
So universally thy censure past,
On all offenders, (and it will so vex
In private, and so openly perplex
Great multitudes, so many sev'r^ll ways)
That, it will make thee hated, all thy days.
Where do thou live, or whi^her can thou go,
But there thou art assured of a foe?
The City, and the Court, thou have controld,
With Commons, and with Nobles thou art bold;
Unconscionable Lawyers here are checked.
Thou do some faults of Clergymen detect,
With so much evidence, that be thou sure
Of all the mischief which they can procure;
And that, not one of them thy friend will be
Who from those imputations is not free.
All they that are notoriously, Transgressors,
All Schismatics, and all our false Professors
Will bitterly oppose thee. And no spite
Is like the malice of an Hypocrite.
In brief (excepting those that are sincere
In life and Doctrine) no man will appear
As thy partakers: And, what are those ^ew.
To that great Army, which will thee pursue?
If this deject me not, another thought
Is by another way upon me brought^
It whispers to me, that these Li^es will wake
De^raction; and that she revenge will take,
For interrupting and reproving Sin,
That in security would feign have bin.
Nor, is that now unpractiz'd: For, there be
A world of dogs already ba^ting me.
Hypocrisy* and Envy do combine,
With guil^y Malice, how to undermine
My good Repute, (that by a dis-respect
Of me, my words may take the less effect)
They compass me about, they watch my ways,
And mark my speeches (as good David says)
That if but sparks of error, they can see,
They blow them may, till flames they seem to be.
Let but a foolish word, slip out among
My c^mmon t^lkings, (for alas' whose tongue
Does never err*) they straight to censure take it,
And, such a piece of wickedness they make it;
That, should on them a judgment ^o severe
From God be past (or by the world) I fear
It would so heavy on their persons come;
That they would think the same a cruel doom.
If they but see me do what they suppose
May tend to folly, (though my Maker knows
The deed suspected, is as far from fin,
As that which I am best employed in)
They instantly a rash conclusion draw;
And speak their dream, as well as what they saw.
They fancy in their own corrupted thought,
What may at such a time, or place, be wrought,
By evil minded folks: and, thereupon,
Conclude the very same by me was done.
Then they ^elate it: and though naught were seen
Which might indeed a likelihood have been
Of such an act; they, by themselves devise
To fashion out fair probabili^ies
Of what they speak: and, by the Devils aid,
Acts innocent, sometimes are so betrayed;
So mis reported by the spite o^ those
Whose wickedness, perhaps, I did oppose*
Yea, blameless circumstances, otherwhile,
Are so mistaken; and do so beguile
With shows of proving and confirming, that
Which was conceived by prejudicate
And false opinion; that, it makes them ^old,
To think their fained slander may be told,
With good belief: then to divulge about
Their lies (of me) they search companions out.
And as they are of sundry minds who raise
Such Scandals; so, they vent them diverse ways.
If of the sort they be, whose open sin,
Has in my Poems reprehended bin;
Or such as they, who dai^y guilty be
Of doing that, wherewith they flander me:
Then, in despite, or to extenuate
Their own offenses; thus, of me they prate.
This man (say they) that strips and whips the times
And, does so thunder in his railing rymes,
(Against the faults of others) is no less
Ingul^ed in the sinck of wickedness
Then he that is worst. His Dalilah has he,
And his beloved sins, as well as we.
He such a place frequenteth; he has been
Met there, and there: him, we have daily seen
With such or such a one, at such a season:
Do so, and so; for which we know no reason:
Thus he is thought to be, and thus to do:
Yea, some of them will impudently to,
Affirm they saw, what they but misconceived;
If they do find their slanders vnbeleeved.
And when they speak such things, they neither care
To whom, nor when, nor yet how false they are.
If they be such who merely out of spite,
Or envy, to disparage me, delight;
(As do some Poetasters) they forbear
To speak downeright (because they do not dare)
And utter Parables. They, knavishly,
Their f^lshoods to some Truths, do closely ty,
To get belief. Things proper unto me,
They mix with attributes that cannot be
To me applied, that so they may evade,
When question of their purposes is made.
They speak but half their matter out; and leave
The rest, for those that hear them to conceive
What they shall please: but, first disclose they will
Enough to make their best conjectures ill.
With words ironicall, they do revile me:
The Valiant Poet, they in scorn do style me.
The Chronomastix; and when taxt they are
That me they meant, their meanings they forswea^.
When these applauded Wits, have at the Po^
Some Novice, or some new admirer got
Of their Strong-lines (which warmed by the heat,
Of Sack, or Claret, they, perhaps repeat)
Twere worth your sight, to see how soon the fire
Of Bacchus, their large brain pans does inspire.
With mimmick strains: And how they shuffle i^
Selfe-praises; and how grossly they begin
Occasions, that they may enthrall your ear
With some new-pe^ee of theirs, which you shall hear
Perforce; yet hear it with so much ado,
That you must think you have a favor to.
For with as many tedious circumstances
As does some capring fool before he dances,
(Or Singer, which must tired be with wooing,
To do what willingly, he would be doing)
They do begin to read, or to rehearse
Some fragments of their new created Verse,
With such a Gesture, and in such a Tone,
As if Great Tamberlaine upon his Thro^e,
Were utt'ring a majesticall Oration,
To strike his hearers dead with admiration.
Which often so works upon their Auditory,
That, to the great advancement of their glory,
They lade them with applauses, and with drink
Till they themselves* the Kings of Poets think.
To which opinion, when once raised they be,
Then shall the Draw^^, or the Tapster see
Their natural humor, which (if true some say)
Is better worthy seeing, then a Play.
Among the rest, it is odds, but e're they go,
The Poets must be summoned in a row
To bide their drunken censure; which does shame
Those few they praise, much more then those they blame.
Among the rest, it chances, some By-stander
By naming me their Catalogue does slander.
If then a man of fashion he appear,
Who undertakes my name to mention there,
The man (say these) may pass; but, such as he
(By us) no Poets are esteemed to be.
A haz the way of making pretty Rimes,
To fit the apprehension of the times;
And, him for that, the multitude does favor:
But, in his lines, there is but little savor
Of Reading, or Antiquity. Thus far
They go, if they perceive their hearers are
Indifferently affected. And if they
Do find them jealous of my fame, they will say,
Most fawningly, sometime those wo^ds of me
(In way of praise) that I should blush to be
Within their hearing. Yet, they will interpose
Some jestings, now and then; or, in the close,
Induce, by way of merriment, some cause
To bring their good opinions to a pause.
Affirming, that though Drunkard I am none,
Yet, I reputed am a wanton-one:
By some such way their ^pleen they will satisfy.
But, if no friend of mine appears by,
So freely, then, they vomit all their gall,
That they scarce make me any thing at all.
And some, who neither knew them well, nor me,
Have thought me baser then the basest be.
Some others, by their malice, thought I had
Some worth in me, which them so envious made;
And came to know me; and when me they knew,
They told me this, which I have told to you.
Some other, show at large, they wish my shame,
But to their Libels will not set their Name,
For fear of danger. And though such can gain
No prudent man (at first) to entertain
Their fatherless reports: yet, sure they are,
The world has Knaves and Fools enough, to hear
The falsest tales; and that, when far they go,
The best suspect, and often believe them too.
There be some other, who (out of a light
Vain hum^ur) love to hear, and to recite
Men's personal defects (without intent
Of doing right or wrong in what they vent)
They speak at random, whatsoever is new,
Not much regarding whether false or true;
And, do but serve to bear the tale about,
And blow the fire, which else would smother ou^.
There is another brood of these Detractors,
Who in traducing me, are common actors:
And, they are such who cunningly conceal
Their hate and envy with a holy zeal:
They, whose Religion, and whose honest^es
Consist in judging those infirmities
That are in others. If these men espy
Some little Atoms in their brothers eye*
They straight as busily do heave at them,
As if the smallest were a mighty Beam.
Their lying suppositions must be took
For verities; or ^lse they will not brook
A word you speak: nay (if you do misdoubt
Their ^ensures) from the Church they thrust you out.
They Charity pretend; and, though they are
Well pleased when they have something to declare
Which may disgrace another, they will seem,
To have his reputation in esteem.
As loath to speak; they will bring it round about;
And thus (or some such way) divulge it out.
Now verily it gri^ves our very hearts,
The man whom God has blessed with such parts,
Should walk in such unsancti^^ed ways.
And then, they white me over with some praise
To make the spots the blacker which they mean
To spirt upon me, from their mouths unclean.
And though those Tales they build their Censures on
Were first received from some such wicked one
Whom they in other matters do distrust,
Yet is their criticisme so unjust,
That in disgracing me, their words they will take*
And, ^lso, of themselves, conjectures make
To justify their scandal^; that they may
The su^er be, their stains on me to lay.
Thus by the seeming sanctity of those,
My good intention (in these Poems) growe^
More frustrate, then by all the rage of them*
Who, with an open impudence, contemn
My best Designs. These, strike me deeper than
The wounds of twenty thousand others can:
Ye^, by their means the w^rke that I have wrought
(With such a mind, as that it might have brought
More good repute, then many others get)
Serves but to make me seem a counterfeit:
Yea, all my doings which are most upright
They judge as actions of an Hyp^crite,
Which is the worst of Sinners. And in this*
If they have placed their bitter doomes amiss,
What sin is theirs? Or, when can greater wrong,
Be done at any, live he never so long?
Thou know oh! God (for thou all hearts do know)
That though through frailty, of^ astray I go;
And, otherwhile may tread that doubtful path
Of which the world a wrong opinion has;
That neither I allow of any sin
VVithi^ my self, nor would continue in
The ^mallest error, if I knew the same.
Thou know that what has caused my greatest blame
Among some Censurers; is that by which
I am indeed, become most truly rich:
And that it also makes me reform
My ways the better; and those works perform
To which thou call, with fa^re greater ease.
And I am likewise hopeful, thou will please
To bless my cou^ses. For, thou Lord have known*
(In that rough track, through which my feet have gone:)
How grieved I am, when I misled have been,
Or in my actions, if ought has been se^ne
Of^ensive unto others Thou do view
My path; and with what mind I do pu^sue
The way I go* Thou know Lord, that I
Have often refrained the Christian liberty
I might have took; left many that are weak
Might of my lawful freedom, evil speak.
Thou know this; and I am certain to
That pleases thee which in thy fear, I do.
By these, and such like mischiefs which I see
This wicked wo^ld has power to bring on me,
I often wax doubtful; and sometime I shrink
Even from those just im^loyments, which I think
God calls me to And then I half desire
I might into obscurity retire
From whence I came; and be discharged quite
From this great warfare, wherein, yet, I fight.
For, many heavy waights on me are thrown
By these engagements (to the world unknown)
Yea private combats there are fought in me,
So many, and so dangerous they be,
That often my Hopes are almost driven from me,
And, dull Despair would surely overcome me,
Were God not always ready to defend me,
And, as mine fails, his own power to lend me*
But, when my self o'recharged I do find;
When flesh and blood begin to shrink behind;
And when I see my Foes have mustred all
Their force against me: I start up, and call
A better aid then mine own Virtue gives me;
And, by his holy Spirit, God relieves me:
He makes me strong, in each good undertaking;
And answers all the doubts my heart is making,
In ^his, and all good purposes, whereby
I have been hopeful him to glorify.
He warrants me I have no cause to fear
These Lines the fruits of thoughts distempred are,
Though some shall judge them such; since he whose mouth
Does speak the words of sobernes and truth,
May seem to those, who thought judicious are,
As mad, as Paul, to Festus, did appear.
He has assured me, I cannot run
This honest way, a course to be undone.
He does persuade me, that if I grow poor
By doing well; my wealth shall be the more.
He says, that if his glory I have sought,
(And for no wicked purpose closely wrought)
I shall no mischief, nor displeasure have;
Nor any loss, by which I shall not save.
He makes me ce^taine that my former pain,
And this endeavor, some effect shall gain;
Although it compass not that reformation,
Which I desire to see in this our Nation.
For though their present evils be not staid
From growing worse, by that which I have said;
It shall to other times a warning give,
And aggravate their faults who now do live;
If, having such a plain Remembrancer,
Their (called for) Repentance they defer.
He bids me know, that though I am not Sainted,
So much, as of all sin to live untainted,
Yet* to oppose each Vice, as I am able,
(In word and deed) it will be warrantable;
And, that, to strike at Sin, it will all become,
Though Persons may be touched but of some.
He tells me, that (although the world shall please
To term it railing, when such Messages
Are utt^ed forth) it cannot bring me shame,
To call g^osse Sinners by their proper name;
And, that Gods blessed Saints have done as much,
Who aid the fol^ies of their ages tou^h.
He wills me that on him I should depend;
And, not distrust that while he me does s^nd
About his bus^nesse, he will suffer mine
To be unprosperous, or my soul to pine.
Since unto him that for his glory strives,
The promise of all needful things he gives.
He strengthens me, and gives me satisfaction
Against all envy, malice, or detraction:
Says, that a guiltless conscience needs not care
How bitter or foul* mouthed others are:
Persuades me, that if my repute be needful
To honor him; he will, himself, be heedfull
To keep it fair: Else, glorifi^ his Name
The more, perhaps, by bringing me to shame.
And, so the Name of God I glorify,
I pleased am, though I have infamy.
By these, and many other such like things
Which God (I trust) to my remembrance brings,
My fainting soul is cheered, when she droupes;
These, raise again my courage when it stoupes:
And though illusions these appear, to some,
Yet, to approve of them a tim^ will come;
And, when that Day of trial, on shall draw,
(Which I attend for, both with joy and awe)
It shall be known, whose heart was most upright*
Or mine, or theirs, that in my harm delight:
For, then their Justice which a veil yet wears.
Will shine like Phoebus when no Cloud appears.
Thereof (just now) I have an earnest given:
These Musings drew it (for me) down from heaven:
I feel them warm my heart, and fetch again
My chilled blood, to run in every vein.
They rouse my spirits, and my drouping soul
They so revive, that now I could control
An host of Kings. For, now (ju^t now) the glowing,
Of their kind ^eat, I find more strongly growing:
Just now I feel in me their operation,
To urge me forward to the consummation
Of what my fo^mer Canto's have beg^n:
And, Go^ assi^ting that shall no^ be done
To thee oh London, I directed last
My just reproof; And I will back^a^d cast
An eye on thee again: For, off I brake
My speech before my mind I fully spoke.
I have not vented yet, what I could say
Of many sins abounding at this day;
As, thy intemp'rancy, and thy excess
In food and raiment, thy loose drunkenesse;
Thy multitudes of beggars, which increase
For want of orders, in thy Times of peace.
Thy Sloth, Lust, Avarice, and all that rabble
Of vices, and of things abominable
Which in each corner of thy streets appear,
As if they justly tolerated were.
I touched not thy corrupted Officers,
I have not mentioned thy Senators,
Nor have I shown as yet what scandal grows
To thee, and unto thine, by some of those;
How partial, nor how ignorant they be,
How prejudicial many times to thee,
And to thy public weal, for private gain*
How cowardly thy Customs they maintain*
How ^eadily thy Freedoms they betray
(If their promotions, it ought further may,
Or spare their purses) This, I have not shown,
For, what belongs thereto, is better known
To others then to me. Yet, much has been
Of them reported; and I much have seen
Of their condition, which deserves blam^*
Nor do I greatly wonder at the same*
But I, much rather marvel that in thee
So many prudent Senators there be;
Since, very few of all thy double dozen
For Courage, wit or honesty are chosen.
Wealth makes an Alderman (however got)
If he be pleased to accept the Lot.
In hope to gain his Fine, thou will adventer
To let the most ignoble fellow enter
That is but rich; and worthy men forgo,
Who to thy Government, might ho^or do.
Thou seldom carest how he did become
So^^ch, if he but harrow up the sum
That makes him capable of such a place;
Nor heedest thou, a jot, how base he was.
No honest Occupations I contemn,
Nor their professors; but I honor them,
Though of the lowest order; If I find
They have not lost the virtues of the mind,
In those mean Callings; and, have sought as much
In knowledge, as in money, to be rich:
Yea, those (when from poor fortunes they ascend,
To wealth) to honor also I commend.
But, is it possible, that man whose mind
To serve his Mammon only, was inclined;
Or is it possible, the man that had
By birth and breeding, nothing but a trade
To get experience by; (and, that perchance
^ome handicraft, which furthers ignorance
In useful knowledge) or, that they who scrape
And scratch together an unweildy heap
Of needless riches, by penurious fare;
By sparing^esse, in what they should not spare:
Or, which is worse, by cruellest extortion;
By robbing others of their lawful portion,
By rapine, guile, and such impieties;
Is It possible (I say) when these m^n rise
To wear thy skarlet-Robe; that they will be
Or honor, or advantage unto thee?
If those black Aeth^ops, if those Leopards, change
Their spots, or color, I shall think it strange:
If ever they regard what weights be thrown
Upon thy back, so they may ease their own:
Or for thine honor stand (who have no sense
Of any thing* but saving, and expense)
I shall beleve that Wolves will tend our Sheep,
And greedy Kites, young Chickens harmless keep.
I might have mention made of that report
Which is divulged of thy Orphans court:
Of those perpetual Jurors, which for pay
Attend judicial trials day by day:
Of those Ingrossers who thy trades abuse;
Of those who make thy Freedoms and thy Dues
A damage to thee: and of other some,
Who other ways injurious are become,
I might have spoke; and would; but that I hear^
They do already sound in every ear.
Truth is, the spreading leprosy of sin,
Into thy very walls have eaten in,
And will not thence be scraped out (I fear)
As long as there be stones, or mortar there.
Thy Vineyard brings not forth wild grapes alone,
In lieu of all thy God bestowed thereon;
But, also, of it self prevents his curse,
And has produced what is ten times worse:
Thorns, briars, nettles, hemlock, and such weeds
As choke all pleasant plants, and fruitful seeds.
No place, no person, calling, nor degree,
Nor sex, nor age, is from corruption free.
Within thy Chambers lodges Wantonness;
Upon thy Boards is heaped all excess:
With vomitings, they often o'reflowed are;
And, from uncleanness no Room is clear.
Thy Hals are daily filled with a rabble
That stand and swear about a Shove-groat table.
Within thy Parlours, I can little see,
But visiting of Mistris-idle-be.
Within thy Wardrobes, Pride lays up her store*
Upon thy Couches, Sloth dot^ lie and snore.
Within thy Pleading-Courts, are shameless railings,
And, of upright proceeding, many failings.
Thy Churches (be it spoke without offense)
Are full of rudeness, and irreverence.
Thou usest in thy Shops ^alse weights and lying;
Unpitied at thy Doors, the poor a^e crying.
Within thy Closs^ts, mischiefs are invented;
Thy Theaters a^e usu^lly frequented
Wit^ persons dissolute: disparaged are
Sometimes, the most de^erving actions, there.
There, see you may uncomely p^esentations,
And often hear unchristian p^ophanations.
Yea, ev'^y corne^, every street, and p^th
An overf^^w of sin, and folly has.
Am^ng thy Feasts, are surfetting^ unclean;
Vain curiosities, and songs obsceane.
Thy Merry m^etings the procurers be
Of most disor^ers that are found in thee:
There, lawless games are used; there, are broched
Vile sl^nders; and, good men are there reproched.
There, they that a^e not good, are often made worse
By lewd examples* or profane discourse.
And, few contentions have occasioned bin,
But, at such meetings, they did first beg^n.
Thy Aged-folke are froward, avaritious,
Self willed, and imprudently ambitious.
The younger fort, are ^eadstro^g, rash, and haughty,
Thy Children are forgetful of their duty.
The men imperiously their power abuse,
And counsel from their helpers do refuse.
Thy women* too much dote on vain attire^,
And are incon^tant in their own desires.
The Magistrates do bad examples give,
And, as men borne but for themselves they live.
Of persons, they retain too much respect:
Their places, for their credits, they affect
(O^ for their gain) but not for conscience sake*
Inferior Officers, do also take
The selfsame courses: and (in what they do)
Are parti^ll, cruel and unfaithful to.
Few single-persons live in chastity;
In Marriage, there is much disloyalty.
Perpe^uall suites, and quarrels I do see
Among those Neig^bour^, that sh^^^d loving be:
No malice is like that which I have known,
Twixt Brothers, when dissension has been sown.
Their p^actices, who friend^hip do p^ofesse
(In my op^nion) promise nothing less:
For, all their form all kindness, often is spent
In visitings, and fruitless complement.
And, all they seek (for ought that I perceive)
Is, how they one another may deceive
In friendly Terme^; Or, how to do as they
Who act the parts o^ friendship in a Play.
Thy Richmen, do Idolatry commit
With M^mmon, and Gods benefi^s fo^get.
Am^ng the poor are many wicked t^ings;
Impaciency, ungodly murmurings,
Theft, scolding fightings, cursings, taleing, lies;
And though they live by others charities,
N^ people will pursue each other so
With malice and d^spig^t as they will do.
At D^ores and windows, Strumpets impudent
D^e si^; and wanton gestures there invent
To woo, by their allu^ing provocations,
Vain men to drink their Cup of Fo^ni^ations.
T^y Suburbs, are the Coverts, and the den
W^^rein are sh^ltred many beasts unclean.
Thy Tavernes, are the places where most soul
And heinous things are done, without control.
There* d^ink they healths, till health is drunk away;
And, naught ashamed are to let the day
Be w^^nesse of their drunken vomitings,
Brawles, ^eelings, ravings, and such brutish things:
Nay, to consume the day in drunkenness,
And all the night, is nothing now, unless
The Hoboyes, Cornets, Drum and Trumpet sound,
To tell the neighbors how the healths go round.
And when, acco^ding to their heathnish fashions,
They offer up their devilish Drink-obla^^ons,
What do they better then Idolatries,
And Festivals, to Bacchus solemnize?
In thee (beside thy proper faults) are found
Those also which are common, and abound
Throughout thy Kingdoms. And even thou, and they
Have been companions in one evil way.
We all, as in one Teeme, have drawn on sin;
Gods promises and threatenings mocked have bin;
The lust man's righteousness we have belied;
And, sinners, in their sins, have justified.
Of Good and Evil, we exchange the name;
And, that, which to remember, is our shame,
Or should with grief repented be; even that
We tell with laughter; and make jests thereat.
Gods Judgments work not on us; we are scourged;
And yet, unto amendment are not urged.
We break the Sabbath-dayes, and we despise
The Churches power, and her Solemnities.
Her Holy-times to us are wearisome;
And in our hearts, we wish the morrow come,
That we might freely buy and sell again.
Those Messengers we soonest entertain,
That of strong drink, and wine, do prophe^ie;
And, Truth is not so welcome as a ^ye.
We sooth our neighbors in their sinfulness:
And (that their secrets, and their nakedness
We may discover) we the wine bestow;
Then, work upon then to their overthrow.
Upon our lusts, the precioust things we spend;
And unto God the Lame and Blind we send.
We rob him of his Tithes, and his Oblations,
Our public Fasts, are public prophanation^:
For, even our prayers, our fasts, our alms, and all,
Are often for show, and hypocritical:
And used more, our safeties to provide,
Then that our Maker may be glorified.
Our hearts against Gods Prophets hardened are*
And what they preach or threat, we little care.
The Land, throughout, because of Oaths does mourn;
We stagger in our paths; and to return
To Egypt ready seem; unless God grant
(^t our first longing) every toy we want.
The blood of Innocents has spilled been
Upon our skirts; most filthy things are seen
Within our vessels; and, yet, some of us
Presume to say (even to our brethren) thus;
Stand off, for we more holy are then ye.
And, these like smoke within Gods nostrils be*
We stumble at noone day: and as the blind,
We groap, uncertainly, the wall to find*
With Death, and Hell, a bargain we have made*
And, nothing for our hopes, but lies have had.
If any Moral Verues do appear;
With some unsavorinesse they leavened are.
If any do a kindness to his brother,
It is in policy to get another:
Or else, with some upbraiding, or vain boast,
Whereby the comfort of the deed is lost.
If ought be spoken to another praise,
It is some p^ofit to our selves to raise.
If comfort to the grieved be p^etended,
The grieved party is as ill bef^iended
As Job: For, what we do is but for fashion;
Without good meaning, wisdom, or compassion.
If we instruct, we do it but to show
That we much more then other men do know.
If we our brethrens errors do reprov^*
It is not as it ought to be, in love:
But, with such bitterness as plain does show,
We more the person, then the vice pursue.
We cann^t give an Alme^, but we must sound
A trumpet: neither wall a rod of ground
For public use: nor set a pane of glass^
In some Church-window, where it needless wa^;
Nor trim a pulpit, nor erect a style;
Nor mend a foot path, though but half a mile;
Nor, by the highway side, set up a stone
To get a horseback; but we fix thereon
Our Names, or somewhere leave upon record,
What befactors we have been ( good Lord)
For such hypocrisies, and sins a^ these
On other places, does Gods judgments seize:
For these, thy Pastors often have warned thee;
For these, they said thou should afflicted be:
And, at this present, veng^nce is begun;
Thoug^ ignorant thou seem of what is done.
For these offenses, God did now of late
Make all thy fairest lo^gings desolate.
For them, the Pestilence continues yet,
And we with scabs, and sores, and blames are smit.
For them, thou of thy braveries unclothed,
Were in thy greatest sorrow, left and loathed,
For them, a Famine lately did begin.
For them, have goodly habitations bin
Consumed by fire. For this, the goods of some
A prey to Seas, and Pirates are become.
For them, thy tradings fail, that were enlarged;
And thou sor single gain, art double charged.
For them, the Sword (that such a while has hung
Sheathed up) is newly drawn, and will ere long
Devour thy sons and daughters; if there be
No more Repentance then yet seems in thee:
Ye throughout all this Island, it will rage
And lay it wast before another age.
For, not our ^ities only tainted are
With sins contagion; but even every where
This Land is so diseased, that many doubt
(Before it mend) some blood must issue out.
There is not any Towneship, Village, Borrough,
Or petty Hamlet, all this Kingdom thorough,
But merits (in proportion) as much blame,
As any City of the greatest fame.
The simple seeming Peasants of the Land,
(Who for their Names do make their sh^epmark^ sta^l
And have not so much Cle^k^hip, as to sp^ll)
Can play the subtil^ cheating knaves, as well
As many cunning Sophisters; and cogge,
And lie, and prate of Law, and pettifogge
As craftily (som^times) as ma^y a one
Who, diverse years has studied Littleton.
Yea, they who never had the wit to learn
Those knowledges which honesty concern;
Have witty craft e^ough to entertain
Or plot a bargain for unlawful gain.
They persecute each other* they envy
Their neighbors welfare, and prosperity;
They drive each other from their tenements;
And are the causes of inhauncing rents,
By over-bidding (for their neighbors Land)
Those Fines the Landlords purposed to demand;
Yet stand their Farms already rackt so high,
That ^hey have beggered half their Tenantry.
In diverse towns they have decayed tillage;
Depopulated many a goodly village;
Yea, joined field to field, till for the poor
No place is yielded, nor employment more:
And, where were households, lately, many a one,
A Shepherd and his Dog, now dwell alone.
To make of griping Usury their trade,
Among the Rich, no scruple now is made
In any place: for, every Country Village,
Has now some Usury, as well as Tillage.
Yea, they that lending most of all detest,
Though but for tolerated Interest,
Do nathelesse take those Annuities,
Which often prove the biting'st Vsuries.
By nature, Money no increase does bring:
Most, therefore, think it a prodigeous thing
That Money put to lone, should bring in gain.
Yet some of these, by practice do maintain
As monstrous usuries, and naught at all
Are tou^hed in their conscience therewithal.
In usury of Cattle, or of Leases,
We may disburse our money for increases
More biting far, then those he dares to take,
Who by mere lending, does advantage make.
As Money nat'rally produces naught,
So, by the Earth small profit forth is brought
Until both cost and labor we bestow,
For little, else, but thorns and weeds will grow.
The Landlord, therefore, here I dare aver,
To be no less a griping Usurer
Then is the Mony-master, if he break
The Rule of Christian Charity, and take
More profit then his tenant can affo^d;
And such as these are hated of the Lord.
Of Usurers, there are some other sorts,
Who keep no certain place: but, both in Courts*
In Cities, and in Country towns they dwell,
And in the trick of griping they excel.
There be of these, that Use for Silence take.
Some others, an usurious profi^ make
Of their Authorities; and do advance
Their wealth, by giving others countenance.
Their cariages, their neighbors fetch, and bring;
They have their seed-time and their harvesting,
Dispatched almost for nothing: such as these,
Are many of our Country Justices.
Some, by another engine profit catch:
They must be prayed and paid for dispatch.
Yea, Cla^kes, and many other Officers,
Are greater, and more hateful Usurers,
Then they that most a^e hated for that crime*
Since these do often for a little time
(Which they delay unjustly) take what may
Of no mean sum, the annual Interest pay.
These men are cruel. And, yet worse by far,
Most Treasurers, and their pay-m^sters are.
For, that which due unto us does remain,
They do not only overlong detain.
But, often, of every hundred, twenty take,
E're payment of our own, to us, they make.
They must have Bribes; their wives must have Caro^hes
Or horse, or jewels; after which encroches
Their servant also, for some other dues
(As they p^etend) which if we do refuse
To pay unto them, twice as much we leese.
This trick inricheth also ^eferres
In Chancery, and in some other Courts
And this or makes, or marreth most Reports,
This, is that common Cheat, and means by which
Mean Officers, so speedily grow rich,
Although they give large Incomes. By this way
Their wives do on a sudden grow so gay,
That were but Kitchin-maid^ few years before.
Yea, many in the blood of Orphans poor,
Have did their gowns in scarlet by such courses,
And clothed, and fed themselves, with widows cu^ses.
But, these Destroyers, make not spoil of all*
For, ^ull as many into ruinefall
By complement, and foolish emulating
Their neighbors; otherwhile, by imitating
The City Fashions. Yea, by these, and some
Such other ways, are many men become
So wake in their estates; that most of those
Who live in fashion, and make handsome shows
Of being rich, would prove (I am afraid)
Far worse then nothing, if their debts were paid.
This flows from our pride, or from excess;
And this is cause of other wickedness*
But, in our Island, one thing I have seen,
Which (though it has not much observed been
To be a fault) will make a large addition
To fill the measure of this Lands transgression.
And much I am afraid, that all in vain
I shall of this impiety complain.
For, Avarice, who naught will give away,
Whereon her griple fingers she can lay,
Pleads for it: yea, and Custom has so long
Confirmed it, that, it is a lawful wrong*
I do not mean the Laities retaining
Of Tithes, or Lands unto the Church pertaining.
For, though I would not build my house with ought*
Which from the Sanctuary had been^ c^ught,
To gain the world, yet, I may do amiss
To judge of others Consciences in this.
It is the barbarous usage, wherewith we
Do entertain those men that shipwra^kt be,
Which here I mean: For, many people have
Less mercy then the Tempest, and the wave.
That Vessel, which the Rocks had pity on,
The cruelty of man does seize upon;
And him that is oppressed, quite bereaves
Of what the quicksand und^voured leaves.
When some poor ship upon the billows tossed,
Is driven by a storm upon the Coast,
With rudder lost, with t^cklings rent and torn,
With maine-mast split, and foremast overborne;
And reeles and rowles, and takes in water so
That all the Mariners through fear forgo
Their crazie Charge, some swimming to the shoare^
On pieces of the deck, or broken oars.
Some on an empty Chest; some holding fast
O^ splinters of a Yard, or of a Mast;
Now riding on the waves; straight sinking down*
Now hoping life, anon afraid to drown;
Pu^ off, and on; yet laboring to attain
The Land, in hope more pity there to gain:
I^ this poor plight, when they (with much ado)
A dryer ^lement have ^ea^ht unto,
And, wet and tired (both on feet and hands)
Come creeping, or else staggering on the sands*
The neighboring people (who in this are far
More s^lvage, then most barbarous Nations are)
In stead of bringing comfort and relief,
Add new afflictions to their former grief,
By taking that small means which is reserved
To keep them living, when their life's prese^ved.
For, those remaining fragments of the^r store,
Which God, sometimes, in pity sends ashore
To help n^w cloth and feed them, till there come
Some friends to aid them; or supplies from home;
Even spoil of those they mak^: and of the prey
^o greedy are; that often when these may
Men's lives preserve, they leave them to their chance,
In hope their death, their profit will advance.
And, if that b^uised- Bark which they fo^sook
(To save their lives) upon some Ouze has struck,
Or on some shelve; from whence, by timely aid,
The goods to land may safely be convaid.
Or if (as chance it may) the Hull be saved,
Yet, thereof, is the Owner qui^e bereaved.
For, by a brutish Custom (which, I know,
Nor Co^sci^nce, nor good Reason does allow)
Some Officer who farms the Royalties
Within that place, does make thereof a prize.
Else, he that owns the Land whereon it falls,
Does seize it: and, his right, the same he calls.
Pa^l did a people, even at Malta, find,
(Although a barbarous Island) far more kind.
Men wrackt, they comforted; but we bereave them
Of those remainders which the Sea does leave them;
Except some living thing abiding be
Aboard the Ship. For, then the same is fr^e
From being pr^v'd a wrack (we say) though that
Which there surviveth, be some Dog, o^ Cat:
A goodly matter, surely, whereupon
Poor men should be reli^ved, or undone.
Some dw^llers, also, on those Borders, where
Such woeful sights, too often viewed are,
Rejoice to see them; yea, some people say,
That, for such mischiefs, they both watch and pray;
With curs^s, banning the^, who set up Lights,
To guide the Seaman in dark stormy nights.
And (though they ^eek it with a devilish mind)
Gods-good, they call, what on the shore they find.
Gods-gift, in^eed it is, which unto them
Does from the Seas, without an owner swim:
Yet, when the master of it shall be known*
Gods gift it is not; but a bai^, that is thrown
To catch the souls of those, who seek to raise
Their fortunes on distressed men's decays.
No marvel, while such cruelties are found
(Upon the Coast) the Sea o'reflowes her bound.
No marvel, she so often, here and there,
Does from their fields so many furlongs tear.
No marvel she, sometime, their cattle drownes,
And, sweeps away the rich^s of their towns:
Or, of those people, otherwhile, devoures
So many households, in a few sho^t hours:
For, since they grieved others, in distress,
The Sea, to them, is justly merciless.
Of many other things, complain I could,
Which through this Kingdom, I amiss, behold:
But, should I now an Inven^ory make
Of each abuse, whereof I notice take
In all professions; sure, it would go near,
To find my Readers, reading for a year.
I fear, our gen'^all Body f^reth so,
As, in the^ sickness, they often do
Who feel not their disease, when they are nigh
(Without good help) upon the point to dye.
They would not be distu^b'd; but, vex and fret,
At those who do prepare them wholesome meat,
Or needful Physic: and, perhaps, with me
My Country, also, will displeased be.
But, for unjust displeasure, it is no matter;
As faith^ull friends (to sick men) will not slatter,
Nor humor them in any such disease;
No more will I be fearful to displease
A sickly people, when I truly know,
I do that work my Conscience calls me to.
I tell thee therefore, Britain, thou art sick;
Thy sins have made thee so; and thou art like
To perish in them, if thou physic take not,
And, for thy safety, good provision make not.
If thou nor feel, nor wilt ^redit give
To what is spoken: Mark thou, and believe
The Symptoms of it. For, they will declare
So truly, how (at this time) thou do far^,
That they who are not reasonlesse, shall see
And say (in times to come) I loved thee.
Behold, even at this day, throughout the Land,
Most Manu-factories are at a stand;
And, of those Engines, some main wheels are broke,
Though where they faulty be, small heed be took.
Thy Mer^hants, by whose trade great profit comes
(And, to the Kings Exchequer, royal sums)
Those M^rcuries, by whose industrious pain.
Thou di^st becom^ the Mistress of the Maine,
And art maintained with ships, which are the walls,
By which thy temp'rall gr^atnesse, ^t^^ds, or falls.
Even they, begin to sink, for want of trade,
And through those boo^ies which of them are m^de.
Their Ship^ without advantage are employed;
And if the Wars, or Time, had them destroyed
Which are in being; they have (to augment
Or fill the number) no encouragement.
The present muster of thy shipping, fails
Of what it was, in many scores of fails,
Not long ^ime since: and, thy next neigh'bring nation
Grows rich in thy decaying Navigation.
Yea, some suspect, that of our public Trade
(For private profit) sale to them is made.
Indeed, ^ost Office^s, if so they may
Enlarge their profits, for the present day;
Or gain, or save the King, but for a year,
Some tho^^and^, do suppose they much endeare
Their service to the State: when ('it is well known
To us abroad) the gain is most their own:
And that, before two ages more be spent,
The ways by which their incomes they augment,
Will cost this Kingdom, for each ounce of gold
So got, hundred, if their courses hold.
It is by them, the Prince becomes poor.
And (thou^h they would be thought (forsooth) much more
Then all his other subjects, to maintain
The dues belonging to a Sovereign)
They rob him more, then all men else beside:
They lose him ten times more then they provide.
They make him needy first; and then they grieve,
And beggar them, that should his wants relieve.
The vulgar Cit^z^ns do much complain
For want of tra^e sufficient to maintain
Their families; and, many, lately broken,
Are of that poverty a certain token.
That famous and that wealthy Merchandise,
Which from our clothings, and our wooll^ arise,
Is much decayed. For work, the poor man prays:
The Clothier has not money; and he lays
The blame upon the Merchant; who does swear,
His ships and goods, so often stayed are,
And times so giddy, and so little got
(With so much peril) that he dares not
To make adventures, as (...) e^st has done*
And, so, to ruin all is like to run.
For, from their voyages so often have some
Been hindered (or have been so long from home
In fruitfulesse services) that it has brought
Rich Owners, and their Vessels, unto naught.
Some others, also find it, to maintain
Their, shi^s so costly, (without hope of gain)
That to repair them they do stand in fear
It may undo them, e're things bettered are;
That (might their men be safe) they do protest*
They know not, if to sink, or swi^ were best.
The winds and seas, that here^ofore have borne us
Good will; have proved our foes, and (...) and torn u^.
Our Mariners are like to run away
To serve our foes, for want of work* and pay.
Those places, and those portion^, which belong
To men's deserts; and should to make them strong,
And to encourage them, conferred be;
Are otherwise d^spos^d of: and w^ see
The most deserving men are in disgraces*
Or else neglected; or else, in their places
Impoverished (or else disheart^^^ so)
That some men will not; and some cannot do
Their Country that good service which they might.
And, if this hold, we lose our honor quite.
By those adventures, which are just and free
To every Nation, where good Patriots be,
Thy sons, to fetch thee wealth, and honor home,
Would prodigal of goods and lives become;
By private cost, augment the public store,
And by encr^ase of shipping guard thy shore;
If they might freely seek, and keep that lot,
Which by their cost and valor might be got.
But, men that are of courage, and of worth,
Disdain their goods and lives to hazard forth,
On servile terms; or, to be preyed upon
When they return, by some ignoble Drone:
And, by this means, oh thou unhappy I Will,
Thy ^oes grow strong, and thou grow'st weak the while.
I do protest, I see not that condition
Of man, that has a fortune in fruition,
That is not perilsome; but, he that is borne
The mischiefs of this present life to scorn.
Nor from the highest to the low'st degree,
Does any man well pleased seem to be.
The King complains of want: his Servants say,
They stand engaged in more then they can pay:
And they who in their person service do him,
Want much of that which should oblige them to him.
The charge of War, still more and more does grow;
The Customs fail as trading falls low:
There Is new occasion every day of spending,
And much more borr'wing, then good means of lending.
It Is said, some royal Rents to sale were profer'd;
That Jewels of the Crown to pawn were offered:
Tha^ Church Revennues, for the present need,
Sequestered are (to stand a while in stead
Of temp'ralties) And* some themselves persuade,
That, they shall now be lay possessions made.
But, God forbid: for he that shall bereave
The Church of her inhe^itance, does leave
A curse upon his children; which will stay
Vn^^ll his whole descent be wo^ne away.
To help thy wants, (so great it seems they prove)
There be of those who did not blush to move
Religion might be set to ^ale; and that
We might promiscuous worships tolerate.
The common people murmur of oppressions;
Of being robbed of their due possessions;
Of impudent abuses, done by those
Who should redress them: every wind that blows,
Brings tidings of ill luck; yet, still men fear
There Is worse untold, then that which they do hear^.
For, we have lying News authorized
So long; and falsehoods, have so many spread;
That, when of that a true report is told
Whereof a firm belief receive we should,
We cannot credit it: and, this, perchance,
May to our safety be some hinderance.
If in our selves, we feel not what is amiss,
Observe we, by ^eflection, what it is.
The Germane Emperor, and two King^, that be
As rich and powerful, every way as he,
Are Foes pro^essed; and they bend their power,
Our Countries, and our Nation to devour:
And, while to fight Gods battel^men do feign*
The Kingdom of the Devil they maint^ine.
Our Friends, and our Consederates; for us,
Engaged in undertakings dangerous.
Have suffered loss; and yet, in hazard are
By an unequal and injurious war.
Some, who possess an Union with our Land,
Do work their own advantage underh^^d,
To our disgrace and losses. Other some,
Are neuters yet, who will our foes become,
And with our enemies the spoil divide,
If any ill Adventur^ shall betide.
That princely Branch of our most royal Stem,
Made poor by the Bohemian Diadem,
(But, rich in her own virtues, and that trea^^re
Of heavenly graces, which in plenteous measure
Gods bounty gave her) that illustrious D^me,
(To whom I owe, even more then all I am)
Lives banished, (oh! the mischieves of this age)
And quite excluded from her heritage.
Her LORD, and all those dear and hopeful Pieces,
Drawn off by them; the Nephews, and the Neeces
Of our dread Sov'raigne, are as pilgrims, feign
Within a foreign Country to remain.
Our costly Treaties, do but crossely speed.
Our new Alliance, proves a broken Reed.
Our fo^raine enterprises, full of charge,
Do serve but others glories to enlarge.
Our mighty Navies strongly furnished ou^,
Have lost their pains, in what they went about.
One little Town keeps all our Ports in fear;
Upon the Seas, our Coasters scared are;
And, we that bore the Trident of the Seas;
We, who of l^te, with smaller Fleets, then these
Which now we set aflote, did once constrain
The Carraks, and the Argofies of Spain
To strike their sails: we, that have awed the Deeps,
And every Foreland, through the world, that peeps
Above the Seas: yea, we that from each shore,
Whereon the brinish waves of Neptune rore,
Have brought rich Trophies of our valors home,
Now, back with neither spoils, nor honors, come.
God, with our Fleets, and Armies, does not so
Go forth of late, as he did use to do.
But, diverse years together, as of^ended,
His arm ag^^nst our forces h^th extended*
That hopeful Voyage, which brave Rawleigh made,
To prosecute those golden hopes he had,
Was overthrown, and, (to enlarge the cost)
In him, we more in wit, th^n money lost.
For, to resist us, God himself did stand:
And, st^ll against us, he extends his hand.
Upon A^geir we had a fair design,
That much extracted from our silver Mine,
But* nothing prosper'd, which was then projected,
Nor was there ought, but loss and shame effected;
For, God preserved our enemies from harm:
And, still, against us, stretches he his arm.
When in Virginia we had n^rsed long
Our Colonies, and hoped they were strong*
And, almost able to subsist alone:
By n^ked people they were set upon,
And, sore endangered: For, on us* for ill,
God laid his hand; and lays it on us still.
Auxiliary forces, forth we sent;
(Or, voluntarily from us they went)
To settle on Bohemiahs fatal throne,
Him, whom that Land had cast her choice upon.
But, there our men were wasted: and in steed
Of Jacobs staff, we proved Egypts-reed:
For, God against our powers his power did set;
And, he his band does raise against us, ^et.
We made new Leavies, and marched up the Rhine,
To guard the Country of the Palatine;
But, all in vain. For, nothing did we there,
Except prolong the miseries of War.
God, would not that delivered they should be
By people that so wicked are as we.
But, scourged them and us, in bitter wise;
And, still, his heavy hand upon us lies.
Then, mustred we Ambassadors together;
We sent them often, and almost every whither;
But, by our Treaties we acquired naught:
Nay, many disadvantages they brought;
For, then, our foes for battle did prepare,
When we of peace together treating were.
Yea, God has caused the h^rme that they have done us;
And, still, his hand li^s heavily upon us.
The fortune of the War we tried again
By Mansfield; which did ^^kewise prove in vain.
To Denmark also we did send supplies,
And there, moreover, sick and bleeding lies
O^r honor. And, yet still, against our Land
The Lord of Hosts has stret^hed out his hand.
Throughout the Eastern Indies where we had
A wealthy and an honorable Trade,
A petty Nation, does now baffle, dare us,
And, out of trading, hope e're long to wear us.
Our glorious Fleet, that lately braved Cales,
Of her exploits affords not many tales.
Another* and another too, since then,
Was put to sea, and driven home again
All shaken and be^atter'd. Some, the wind
Sent back, and frustrate made what was designed.
Some others, were by other lets delayed,
And, made to fail, in that which they assailed:
For, God with this our Nation was offended;
And, yet, his hand against us (...) extended.
Another N^vie, worthy greater note,
Then all of these forenamed, now does flo^e
Upon the seas: and such a fame it bears,
That all the neighb^ring kingdome^ it deters.
For, Land and Sea it threatens: and we hear
Before the I Will of Ree, at rode they are,
Where they of brave achievements hopeful grow.
I wish, and I do pray it may be so
As they desire, if God be ^l^as'd therein.
But, much I fear, that we have guilty bin
Of somewhat unrepented yet, that will
Make all our undertakings prosper ill,
Till we are humbled more. For, God has lain
His heavy hand upon us, long in vain.
And, though our hearts with foolish hopes we fill,
His Arm, against us, forth he stretches still.
Or else it could not be our forces great,
So many times should suffer a d^feat.
^or when a lesser Fleet was sent to do
A Mischi^fe, it had power enough thereto.
But let us take a little further heed;
How ill our hopes in foreign parts succeed.
The French and Germane Churches, in w^ose ca^e,
And in whose persecutions we do share;
Have been afflicted in a grievous wise,
And still a heavy but then on them lies.
Gods foes, and theirs, and ours, have cras^ily
Combined in a strong confederacy
The tents of Edom, and the Ishma'lites,
The seed of Agar* and the M^abites,
With Ashur, and the sons of Lot conspire;
With Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, and Tire.
Yea, Gog and Magog; close and open foes,
E^'n all those Armies which Gods truth oppose,
(And by the Names, here mention^d, figured were)
Confederated, and resolved are,
To prey upon us. Come, now come, ^ay they,
Let Us root their Nation, and their Name away.
And, if our God be silent overlong,
Their strength increasing, will increase the wrong
His Church endures: our cause will be o'rethrowne,
And, they will take Gods houses for their own.
If yet, thou do not feel thy sickly case,
Nor in these foreign glasses view thy face,
Look home again; and I will show thee there
More things, that worthy notice will appear.
There, thou shall find distr^ction in the State;
The Commons, and some Nobles, at debate;
The Court it self disturbed with disunions;
Some following others; some their own opinions;
Some striving, from their seats, their mates to thrust;
Few knowing in who^e friendship they may trust.
There see thou shall most seeking the disgraces
Of others; and in all their fellows places
Men so experienced, that they leave to do
Those duties, they themselves are called unto.
There, thou shall see such foolish imitations;
Such complements; such gross ^issimulations;
Such ^ractices; such projects, and devices;
Contriving o^ such foolish paradises;
Such doing and undoing, what is done;
That, 'twill be matter worthy musing on*
Those Offices, and those high seats of State,
(Est^em'd most honorable) are of late
Become so sk^ttish; or the men that get them,
Such artl^sse riders, that they cannot sit them.
When lived, at once, so many, who did c^ry,
(And left disgraced) the st^les of S^cretary,
Of Chamberlain, Chiefe-Iustice, Treasurer,
Of Lord high Keeper, and Lord Chancel^r?
Of these, and other ^itles, when was s^ene
Such chopping and such changing, as has been
In later years? sure, something is amiss,
That such uncertainty among us is.
Those pers^nages, whose words were heretofore
As Oracles; are credited no more
Then Cheaters are. Their hand and seal does stand
For nothing, if no other come in band.
So void are some advanced to high place,
Of common understanding, and of grace,
That neither shame, nor loss, which does befall
To other men, can move them ought at all.
But, as men marked for Venge^nce, or else sent
For thy dishonor, and thy punishment,
They dare proceed t^ practice every sin
For which their predecessors shent have bin.
Nay, some who for corruption were removed
To give those place, mi^ht well have been approved
Respecting them; if all the peoples cries,
From just occa^ion may be thought to rise.
Yea* they have just^fi^d, and honor done them,
Who went before, in having overgone them
In doing wrongs. And, in those wrongs they do,
They are so p^actised, and hardened to,
That no examples, or fair warning shall
Ta^e place ('it is thought) till they have ruined all.
Some Offices are grown so over large
For those who undertake them, to discharge,
Else, they that have them, so unable are,
Or of their duties have so little care,
That suitors poo^e have many times attended
Whole months together, e're they were befriended,
So much, ^o have their humble suits perused.
Yet, these, as if they had not else abused
The Commonwealth enough, do often add
To those employments which before they had,
New Offices; and take so much upon
Their feeble shoulders, that no good is done.
If thou observest men's communication,
Thou hear it shall so full of desperation,
As if they feared God had us forsaken,
And, to some other place himself ^etaken.
But, thou, indeed, his Covenant have b^oke;
His Word distrusted; his Commands forsook;
And, aid from Egypt, and from Ashur sought,
Whose tru^^lesse f^iendship will avail thee naught.
Nay, some there be, that in these days of evil,
Advise to make atonements with the Devil.
For, they do little better who would call
The Turk^, to help maintain the Churches wall.
Yea, they who make that Foe our aid ^ecome,
Do save a hou^e, by firing Ch^istendome.
The Land appears, as if ^t rip^ning were
For Desolation: and even every where
Most ^en are grown so p^odigally vain;
So greedily pursue they pre^en^ gain;
And, from this pleasant Kingdom have so rent
Her woods, her grov^s, and every ornament,
(Without all care of pla^ting, or renewing
For their Posterities, in times ensuing)
As if they either thought, or did foresee,
That when they died* the world would ended be*
Or that, before the following generations,
This Land should be possessed by other Nations.
We have not power their counsel to receive,
Who for our safeties best advisement give:
For, in themselves, such baseness most retain,
That, all are thought to aim at private gain.
And doubtless we have many Mountebanks,
Who arrogate the profit and the thanks
Of others labors; or else seek to cross
Their good designs, to their disgrace and loss.
Yea, such extreme corruptions every where
In men of every quality appear,
That whatsoever reasons may be rendered,
To prove that by some courses which are tendered,
(To be proceeded in) the common peace
Or profit might in future times increase,
And be advanced, a million by the year:
Yet, if but any p^ivate persons fear
It may some income^ from their ch^sts withdraw,
For which they neither Conscience have nor Law:
These men (if they attempt it, and be able
To give a bribe that may be valuable
In any measure) quite shall overthrow
That good designment: and not only so,
But these and they that were their instruments
Shall purchase him who that design invents,
(For his reward) both infamy and hate*
And make themselves appear unto the State
Good Patriots; who (being sifted well)
Are scarce so honest men as go to hell.
Rapt by a sp^rituall Vision, I have seen
The thin and crasie wall, that stands between
Our fight, and their concealed practices,
Who have the place of Elders in these days:
And spying there a hole, I dig^'d into
Their se^resies; to see what works they do.
W^ere (not without Gods warrant, and his aid)
Most foul abominations I su^vaid.
I saw their Chambers of Imagery,
And all those Objects of Idolatry
To which they bow, upon the walls depainted:
I saw t^ose toys ado^ed and besainted:
I saw what strange devo^ions there they use;
How they in private do the world abuse*
And from their Censers seemed to arise
A cloud which dimmed the Sacrificers ey^s.
There (oh! good God) how many did I see,
Who zealous Prelates do appear to be?
How many Statesmen, and how many a one
That ou^ high s^ats of Judgment si^s upon?
How many who ^igh^ honest men appear?
In outward show how many draw^ng near
Unto their graves? how many learned men?
How many, that will stoutly now and then
M^int^ine an honest cause, to some g^od end,
(For ought we k^ow) when they no good ^ntend
How many ill-disposed men (oh! God)
Who otherwise aff^cted seem abroad,
Beh^ld I there in secret prostituting
Th^mselves to breathless Idols, and imputing
Great power unto them? and how base are those
Sometime i^ private, who make goodly shows
Of noblest thoughts? Some, to the rising-Sun
Directly kneel; some, fix their eyes upon
The Moon, which from his beams receives her light:
Some, stand devoted to the works of Night:
Some, deifie their ^ride, and some their Lust:
In ca^nall Policy, some put their trust:
Some (as a Goddess) V^ngean^e do emplore:
V^^ighteous Mammon, othersome adore:
With worldly Honor, some idolatrize;
Some other, to their Nets do sacrifise:
To Pleasure, many offer their estates;
H^ms^lfe to En^y, one man dedicates:
Another makes Vaineglories altars fume,
Till all his pa^rimony he consume:
A third, to Sloth and Idleness does bow.
Before Excess* a fourth does fall as low:
Yea, Horses, Dogs, and Hanks; even Beasts and Fowl^s,
Are Idols of their love. Nor has their Souls
Id^lat^iz'd with brutish things alone,
But, even with Gold, and Silver, Wood, and Stone.
Nor have they only of such things as these,
(That real be) set up vain images
Within their hearts; but, they goe^ further, far,
And worship Fictions, which the likeness are
Of naught in heaven, earth, sea, or in the waters
Below the earth; but, mere fantastic matters.
And, that by such l^ke Gods, as are their Treasure,
Their Honor, their Preferment, and their Pleasure,
They may be happy made; what things I pray,
To show their zeal (suppose you) offer they?
Even those, respecting which, these gods are vile.
For, they do give unto them, otherwhile,
Their natural rest and sleep; sometime their heal^h*
Sometime what is due to God they take by stealth,
To waste upon their Mawmets; and of these,
One ostred is, another to appease.
Their beauteous daughters some of them have given
To Moloch: other some their wives have driven
To pass the fire: great numbers make oblations
Of all their friends, to those Abominations.
To serve them, some, their Country set to sale;
Her love, her wealth, her honor, peace, and all.
Yea some, even their own lives to loss expose,
(Their consciences, and souls) for love of those;
And (lest unto a reprobated sense)
With Gods and Natures Laws they can dispence^
Of these, a Vision did appear to me:
Judge Readers, whether true or false it be.
If no such doings be, my word^ contemn,
And let this Vision pass but for a Dream.
If really thou find it to be so,
Then think oh! Britain, what thou haft to do.
But, think it seriously: for, things that are
In foulest plight, will often f^ire appear.
Bel^eve not all that shall reported be;
But, prove and search; and trust what thou do see.
The Land is over-spred with wickedness;
Yet, no man will himself in fault confess.
Men daily talk how bad the times are grown,
Yet, few men see an error of their own.
The Country is distressed many ways,
And on the Cities pride, the blame it lays.
The City finds her trading salleth short,
And thinks the cause thereof is in the Court,
The Court complains, and railes as much again,
Against the Farmer, and the Citizen.
Our Parliaments imputed have of late,
Our troubles to some errors in the State.
The State off^nded is, and discontent
With some proceedings in the Parliament.
Our Court Divin^s, protest the Lawyers stand
So much upon the Customs of the Land,
(The Laws and ancient Freedoms, which belong
Unto the Commons) that, the King they wrong.
The People vow, the Prelates flatter so
To get preferment, that they will undo
Both Church and Commonwealth; and some conceive,
If we their State-Divinity believe,
It will of every privilege bereave us,
And no more Law, but Will and Pleasure leave us.
And, as the Jews, to save their Place, and Name,
Did that, which loss of both of them became:
So, thought it is, that if our Prelates fall,
The way, they seek to stand, effect it shall.
The followers of Arminius some revile,
As troublers of the Churches of this I Will.
Some think the doubts and questions they have moved
Shall make the Truth more known, and more approved.
The Papist says, that we afflicted are,
Because their superstitions banished were.
Some Protestants believe we fare the worse
For favoring them; and that they bring a curse
Upon the La^d. Some others, do accuse
The Separatists, and those men who refuse
Unto this Churches orders to conform.
They, on the other side, as much do storm
Against our Discipline and Hierarchy,
As parts of Antichristian-heresie.
And though we all are naught; yet, we do all
Each other censure, persecute, miscall,
And so c^ndemne; as if we had no such
Infirmities, as we in others touch.
But, as her virtue may be never the more,
Who first, in scoulding, calls her neighbor whore,
So, he that soone^t check abuses can,
(At all times) proves not the holiest man.
Even I, that in whole Volumes, do complain
Against those faults, which in my times do reign;
May be a Villane, when all that is done,
If other signs of goodness I have none.
But, why speak I of Symptoms, when all see
Thy Sickness, to be evident on thee?
Thou have a fearful trembling at thy heart,
And, a quotidian Fever shakes each part.
Thine eyes do see thy flesh does fall away;
The lovely color of thy cheeks decay.
Thy veins grow empty, which did lately swell;
Those parts are naked, that were clothed well:
Those limbs are weakened, that e're while were strong;
And into gronings thou have changed thy Song.
Yea, thou may feel (unless that sense be dead)
A pain between thy Body, and thy H^ad.
The Staves of God, of which we read it spoken
By Zachary* are bruized, if not broken.
The Staff of Bands (or Union) has some cracks:
And, that of Beauty now so little lacks
Of being shiv^r'd; tha^ thou art almost
The scorn of Christendom: and have nigh lost
Thy form^r glory. Neither art thou ^oly
Despised and dishonored, by thy folly;
But in those mischiefs which thy sin^ procure,
Thy Prince a disadvantage does endure.
His ver^ues are repulsed from that height
O^ honor, whereunto ascend they might,
Were thou less wicked. He, whom as our eyes
We seemed (as but yesterday) to prize;
He, for whose absence we so much complained,
And wept, and prayed, and vowed, whilst he remain^d
Divided from u^: and at those return
We did so many ^iles to ashes burn:
Even he, has not received that content
From us, which he expected, and we meant.
Some spirit of Dissension loos^d has bin;
Some sparks of Discord have been hurled in,
And blown among us; so that he and we
Not so well pleased in each other be
As both desire. And should this flame increase,
God knows how much it would offend our peace.
Thy Body, England, representative,
Unable was prevention to contrive
For such a mischief; neither dare men say
(Although they could) on whom the blame to lay.
Some, do accuse the Parliament; some blame
Another Facti^n; and, I doubtful am,
Some rashly tax the King: but, to provide
A Judge, by whom such parties may be tried,
Who knows (I pray?) or what is he that can
Such points as these, without reproving scan?
Nay, where is he, from faction or from fear
So free, that (though he knew it needful were)
He da^es pre^ume in any public wise,
So much as mention such State-mysteries?
Yet, sure, ^hey must be mentioned; and they may,
By those who know good Reason, and the Way
Of so unfolding them, that no offense
Be given; whatsoever be taken ^hence.
And therefore, though such men who cannot see
What calling at this present warrants me,
Or, by what spirit I am urged to
Those actions which I undertake to do;
Though such conjecture may, that I presume
Too far, and on my self too much assume,
(Beyond my place) yet, in ^y self secure,
I Will put my self their censure to endure;
And all that peril, which the^e coward times
Suppose may follow my truth-speaking Rime^.
Direct thou so, oh God! my hand by thine,
That I in this may draw an eaven Line.
For, no advice from carnal wits I crave:
Nor any Counselor, but thee, to have.
My Prince and Country* though perhaps I be
Not much to them; a^e both most dear to me.
And may I perish, if to save my life
I would betwixt that couple nourish strife.
Or if for one of them I that would say,
Which might from toth^rs due take ought away.
If God direct me not, I may do ill
In this performance; but, I know, to will
And to desire their welfare, is from heaven
(Even by his grace) to me already given.
I may perchance in what I best intend,
Have neither King nor People to my friend;
Yet will I speak my mind to profit them,
Though both should, for my labor me condemn.
For, from all other ends and hopes I Am free,
S^^e those, which in an honest man should be.
If that which profits e^th^r I propose,
They both shall gain, and neither party lose.
But, if that harm shall by my words be done*
I Will weigh them so, it shall be mine alone.
My censure I will give in things, which none
Have da^'d to pass a public Judgment on.
Come, mark me, you who think I now begin
To tread a path which I shall stumble in:
And, if you see, what justly you may che^k;
Trip up my heels, and make me break my neck^
Although we heed not* or else will not see,
Those Maladies which daily growing be;
I find (and I do much compassionate
What I behold) a rupture in the State,
Of this great Body. Lamed are the Feet;
The Legs, that should support her, scarcely meet,
For that great structure which upon them stands*
The Sine^^ are enfeebled; and, the Hands
Unfit for action; deafned are her Ears,
And what concerne^ her most, she hardly hears.
Her Eyes (which are her wa^chmen) are become
Half blind* her Tongue is almost waxen dumb:
It cannot speak the truth for her own wealth:
Her Nose, that should distinguish, for her health*
Twixt things that wholesome, and unwholesome were,
Has lost that faculty: her Pulses are
Uncertain: her Digestion is not good;
And, that has filled her with tainted Blood:
Her Judgment, and her Common-sense so fails,
That she* her self perceives not what she ails:
Her Spleen is stop^; and, those obstructions make
Bad fumings, which have caused her Head to ache.
And He (alas) is bound about the Crown
With cares, that make him bow his forehead dow^e.
Thou art this Body, England, and thy Head
Is our dread Sov'raigne. The distemper bred
Betwixt you two, from one of you does flow;
And which it is, I purpose here to show.
Be bold to hear me Readers; for, in season
I speak; and here is not felony, nor treason.
In this that follows; to have power or aim
To touch the Lords Anointed, I disclaim.
I have no warrant; neither know I ought,
To reprehend him for, although I might.
And, they of my upright^^sse judge amiss,
Who think I flatter, in affirming this.
For, as my Princes fault^ I may not blaze*
So, I am also bound (as there is cause)
To justify what virtues I do hear
To be in him, or, see in him appear.
The general faults of others, mine own eyes
Have seen; and that is enough to warrantize
A general reproof: but never, yet,
In him beheld I, what did unbefit
Hi^ person or his place: much have I seen,
That, rather, has an honor to him been.
And, whatsoever shall muttered be of ^ome,
There reigns not any King in Christendom,
Of whom there was divulged a better fame;
Or, whom a royal Throne so well became.
And, what is lately done, to blot the story
Of his desert? or to deface his glory?
Or wherewithal can any tongue tradu^e
His actions, which admits not excuse?
What if his people have expected more
(From hopes, by them conceived heretofore)
Then yet succeeds? what can from thence redound
To prove his Virtues or his ways unsound?
Why may not this effect arise from them
That so suspect, much rather then from him?
As God long since unto those Jews did say,
(Who judged him unequal in his way)
So say I England; is thy Sov'raignes path
Unequal? or is it rather thine which has
Such indirectnesse? wherefore may not all
Which is amiss, by thine own fault befall?
Why may not (England) a diseasednesse
(Occasioned by thy unrighteousness)
Make him unpleasing in his course to thee,
Whom thou have praised? and whose graces be
The same they were? thou know many a one,
In bodily diseases, thus has done.
Those meats and drinks, that are both sweet and pure,
They can nor truly relish, nor endure.
We seldom see the Bodies torment bred
By ought which first arises in the Head;
But, oftentimes we feel both head and eyes
Diseased by fumes which from the Body rise.
And though down from the head there may distill
Some humor, otherwhile, which makes ^ll
The lower parts; yet, that first vapor'd from
Those crudities and noisome fumes which come
From ^ll digestion; or, from stoppages
Which are in our inferior passages.
It Is thus in natural Bodies; an^ the like
May be observed in Bodies p^litick.
The head and body both are evil pleased,
When any part of either is diseased:
But, their distempers, wo^se or easier are
Sustained, as their first occasions were.
When Lungs or Liver does defective grow
By ought within it self, it pains not so
The head, as when from thence does also fall
Those ^hew^^es and humors, that by tickling shall
Occasion coughs and strainings, to distend
The passages, as if each part would rend.
Nor is the Stomach so distempered,
By any hurt or bruise upon the Head,
(By its own fault received) as when it ake^h,
Through fumings, which from parts below it takes.
So fares it with a People and their King.
Even all their e^rors, griefs and cares do bring
Upon each other so, that what the one
Misdoeth in, does b^ing some smart upon
The other party* But, they shall not be
Afflicted with it, both in one degree.
For, if the Princes oversight or sin,
Of any public Plague first cause has bin,
The greatest mischief will at last be his.
And, if the Subjects have so done amiss,
That Vengeance follows it, the King may g^ieve;
But, they shall be consumed, I believe:
And, that for each ones personal defect
The greatest harm will on himself reflect:
What then to be performed is remaining,
But, that we leave repining, and complaining
On one another, and our labors bend,
Our selves, as much as may be, to amend?
Let every one examine well his way,
And, for himself, and for all others pray.
For, this is far more likely to redress
The present mischiefs, then o^r frowardness.
The party that has innocence, shall
Be sure to stand, though all about him fall.
And, if we all perve^sly wicked prove,
We shall have all, one judgment from above.
If in thy King (oh Britain) ought amiss
Appears to be; 'twixt God and him it is.
Of him he shall be judged. What to thee
Pertains it, his censurer to be?
If thou shall suffer with him; thy offense
Deserved it; and naught else ^ut penitence
Becomes thy practice; neither shall there ought
That Is wrong, by other means, to right be brought.
Thy general voice, but newly, did confess
In him much virtue, and much hopefulnesse;
And, he so late assumed his Diadem,
That there has scarce been time enough for him
Those evils to perform, that may in^erre
A general mischief. Neither, do I hear
Of ought, as yet, which thou to him can lay,
But that he does to thee thy will den^y.
Or with a gentle stoutnesse claim, and strive,
For what he thinks his just Prerogative.
And why, I prithee, may not all this flow
From some corruptions which in thee do grow
Without his fault? why may not, for thy crimes
Some instruments of Satan, in these times,
Be suffered to obscure from him a while
The truth of things? and his belief beguile,
With vert'uos shows, discreet and good pretenses,
To plague and punish thee for thy offenses?
Why may not God (and justly too) permit
Some Sycophant, or cunning hypocrite,
For thy hypocrisies, to steal away
His heart from thee? and goodly colors lay
On projects which may cause him to undo thee,
And think that he no wrong has done unto thee?
Nay, wherefore may not some thy King advise,
To that which seems to wrong thy liberties,
Yet in themselves be honest men, and just,
Who have abused been by those they trust?
Thy wickedness deserves it: and that he
Who in himself is good, should bring to thee
No profit by his goodness, but augment
Thy sorrows, till thy follies thou repent?
For, what is in it self from evil free,
Is evil made, to those that evil be.
Why may it not be possible, that thou
Demandedst what he might not well allow
Without dishonor. Or, if all were right
Which thou requiredst; yet the manner might
Distaste him? Or, who certain is, but some
(Pretending public grievances) might come
With private spleen and m^lice, to pursue
Those faults in others, which their conscience knew
That they themselves were guilty of; and had
No peace with God by true repentance mnde?
If so it were, I do admire the less
That thy petitions had a^ ill success.
If any single man has ought misdone,
It is so little while since he begun
His being to receive; that, in respect
O^ thine, his errors could small harm effect.
But, t^ou have heaped up sin for many years;
And, thy exceeding guiltiness appears,
With so much evidence, that every man
Of some particular faul^s accuse thee can;
And, openly r^prove thee, to thy face,
For evils, done in every time, and place.
Then, blame not him, if God has falsifi'd
Some hopes, of late, or to thy grief, denide
That refo^mation, which thou did require;
And add^d (in the stead of thy desire)
New grievances. Nor too too bitterly
Pursue those errors of infirmity,
Which were by others, heretofore commi^^ed:
But, let all past offenses be remitted.
If thou perceive but hope of reformation,
Go offer up to God, for thy Oblation,
A true forgiveness of their injuries,
Who heretofore have wronged thy Liberties.
And, do not this in policy (although
The times now present may require it so:)
But, so forgive, as by the God of heaven
Thou do desire thy sins may be forgiven:
For, by thy faults, dishonored more is he,
Then thou by ^hei^s that have offended thee.
And if to them thou true compassion showest,
God will not urge, perhaps, the debt thou ow^st.
Of Reformation thou do show great zeal;
But, some corruption may thou not conceal
That mars the bl^ssing? A^^ thou ^ure thou have
No just occasion given to distaste
Thy King? Do thy complainings all, intend
The public welfare, without private end?
And, in preferring them, did thou commit
No errors; nor no decencies forget?
I will not say thou did; but I do fear,
That they who wisest are, in some things err*
Forgive me thou high Court of Parliament,
If I shall utter what will discontent
Thy disunited members, who have sat
In former times, grave matters to debate.
For, though I will not arrogate the wit
To teach so great a Counsel what is fit;
Nor censure any Act which thou have done,
When all thy parts have joined been in one.
Yet, I will take upon me to reprove
Their private errors, who in courses move
Repugnant to thy Justice; and often be
The cause of much dishonor unto thee.
For, none (though thou art wise) can wrong thee ought
To think, that thou have members may be taught.
And, as in pitched Battles, when bystanders
Do apprehend mistakings in Commanders,
(As often they do) 'twere better they should say
What they observe, then let them lose the day:
So also (though I may be thought too bold)
'Twere fitter my experience should be told,
Then that a public mischief should ensue,
And I, in times to come, my silence ^ue.
For, some (no doubt) will well approve the same,
Though other some will think I was to blame:
Yea, that which I will speak shall help, perchance,
(In times to come) thine honor to advance:
For, I will speak no more then what is due,
And, what my Conscience bids my Pen to show.
Thou art an honored Counsel: but upon thee
Such blots are cast, and so much wrong is done thee,
(By some, who sca^cely natural members be)
That, as this Kingdom represents in thee
Her Body; so, thou do become likewise
A representment of her Vanities.
Yea, when at first, to be, thou do begin,
Thou art conceived, and made up in sin.
For, to thy Horse of Commons, whither none
Thou should admit, excepting, such a one
Whose life or knowledge that respect may draw,
Which does become the Maker of a Law;
Too often el^cted are, in stead of those,
The rich, and them that make the gre^test shows
Of youthful gallantry; and, otherwhile,
The very'st humorists of all this I Will.
When choice was of thy Members to be made,
Their ent^ances, but little sign have had
Of prosperous ends: for, they that should have past
A f^ee election, have their voices cast
By force, constraint, or for some by-respect,
On those, whom others, for their ends elect.
There be in Court, and bord^ing round about
Thy Buroughs, many wiser men, no doubt,
Then some that in Elections have their voice;
And, by their aid, there is sometime a choice
Of good and able men: yet, best it were,
That all men le^t to their just freedoms were.
For, they to whom the Providence of heaven,
The right of choosing Burgesses has given;
Are also by that providence (how wise
Or foolish e're they seem in others eyes)
In making of their choices so directed,
As best may serve to make his will e^tected.
And, though the same shall just as well be done
By means of them who lawless courses run,
Yet, not for their advantage, to the best,
Who from their proper motions such things wrest.
Why did the King from his Prerogative,
To any place a privilege derive,
But, that they might enjoy them? And, I pray,
What conscienc^ ties the People to obey
Those Laws or Acts, in Parl'ament concluded,
By those that have by force or fraud intruded?
What reason is it that a stranger should
Entreat me to commit my best Freehold,
To be disposed of, by some one, whom he
Shall (for I know not what) commend to me?
What man but he that modes^y does want,
Can be so impudently arrogant,
To sue by f^iend^, or lett^rs, pl^ce to take
In such a Counsel* yea, and Laws to make?
As if, because he has a little pelf,
He therefore might some Solon think himself,
Or some Licurgus? Or, as if he thought
The Commonwealth would surely come to naught,
Unless his knowledge, or his virtues, were
Elected, to be exercised there.
Whereas (God knows) too many do aspire
To such employments, either through desire
To show their wits; to gain some vain repute,
Themselves, or friends to furthe^ in some suit;
To keep off Creditors; or else, perchance,
To entertain their curious igno^ance
With mysteries of State. Believe it, those
Whose modesty forbids them to expose
Themselves to be elected, I think far
More apt for such employments then they are
That seek them: and it is fittest that in all
Such places, men should sit till they do call
(Of their own will) to whom the choice pertaines*
For, those God sends; and unto them he daignes
Fit graces for the work. The other, have
(Moved by their own ambition) to be placed
In that great Couns^ll, with a mind corrupt;
Which does dishonor often, and interrupt
Their best p^oceed^ngs. And from hence it is,
So many things among us are amiss.
Hence is it, so much time is spent about
The searching of undue elections out.
Hence is it, that in stead of persons grave,
Such numbers of our Burgesses we have
In those Assembl^es, who come ^uffling ^n
With habits which have far more fitting bin
For Theat^rs; then for the reverent
And sacred presence of a Parliament.
Thence is it that so many Children are
Elected to have place and voices there;
Yea chosen Counselors, when hardly past
Their Tutors rod: believe me, this is have.
Although it might excused be, if some
Youngmen should thither for experience come:
It is not tolerable, nathelesse,
That many should admitted be: much less
Those no^age Youths, to whom our Laws deny
A power in things that smaller trust imply.
Hence is it that sometime the very noises
Arising from the multitude of voices,
Foiles Reason. This maintains also factions,
And makes in plainest ma^ters great distractions.
T^is, to those meetings much disturbance bring,
And does occasion many foolish things.
Thence is it, also, we admit of those,
In making Laws, who either do oppose
Proceedings legal; or, protections g^ve
To them that in contempt as Outlawes live*
I hold it not amiss, that they who spend
Their time the public business ^o attend,
Should have their servants from arestings free,
Whilst they themselves in those employments be;
Nor is it worthy blame, if they protect
Poor Debtors, who endeavoring to ef^ect
Their Creditors contents (as they are able)
And using time (in courses warrantable)
For such a purpose; or else to prefer
Complaints against some vile extortioner:
Or to such ends. But, when they do by dozen^
(To every p^odigall, that cheats and cozen^)
Vouchsafe protections; yea, to those that are
Mere strangers too; it worth reproving were:
And, them who do it, I suppose unfit
In places of Lawgiver^ there to sit.
M^reover, an Election out of order,
Does other inconvenie^t matters further,
Not mentioned yet. The party that is chose
By suit, or ill-got favor, seldom goes
Against his Chusers, if it chance that ought
In opposition unto them be brought:
Whereas* in such a case, each man is bound
To be as if new risen from the ground
He should not know his father, nor the son
Of his own body: no nor any one
O^ all his near acquaintance, or his kin;
Nor any that his friend or foe has bin.
But, fix his eye upon the cause alone,
And, do as that requires to be done.
Had this been practiced, many a good conclusion
Had followed more then did. Yea, much confusion,
Much needless cost and pains, had been prevented;
And, many had not gone so di^contented
To their own homes, when they with hearts o'regrieved,
Besought the Parli^ment, to be relieved.
For, if the^r causes (which but right had bin)
Their trials had received, as they came in;
If no man might, by savor of a friend,
Prefer new suits, before all those have end
Which entered are before; poor Sui^ers might
Have hope of sooner compassing their right.
Yea, spare much cost, and many months attending,
To b^ing their endless business to an ending.
For then, what day, or week, or month, at least,
They should be heard, it partly might be gu^st.
But p^ivate friendship shown at such a season,
To work mere private ends, opposes reason.
It does put off and on; and so employ
One friend, another friendship to destroy,
(And, so delayeth him in his just suit,
Who is of such acquaintance destitute)
That, many a one whose cause deserved regard,
Is quite undone, before he can be heard.
For, to attend three Sessions on a row,
With Lawyers often feed, the cause to show,
(Perhaps, a ^undred miles, or two, from home,
With witnesses which on his charge do come
As far as he) may make a rich man poor,
And, homeward, beg his bread from door to door.
There also were (and they who came unsent,
Are likely to be they that now are meant)
Unwise, and undiscreet ones, mixed among
Ou^ Parliaments, who did those meetings wrong*
By controverting of Religion there,
And moving questions that improper are
To that Assembly. For, there is provided
A Synod, whe^ein ought to be decided
Such matters; and what they determine shall,
The Parli^ment may ratify; and call,
And censure those, who either shall proceed
To cross or vilify what is dec^eed.
But, we may blush to see, how much amiss
Some stretch the Parliamentall power in this.
How, they do cause the weak offense to take*
And, say our Parliaments Religions make;
How much the due proceedings hindered are,
By spending time in such like mat^ers, there,
To that high Courts disturbance; and how much
The Commonwealth is damnifi'd by such
Impertinent, and over-busie wits,
Who know not what the Parliament befits,
And what the Synod. But, mistake not me,
I do not think the Parliament should be
Restrained so, as not to show her care
That true Religion be maintained here.
Far be it from my heart: I wish they should
Religion to their utmost power uphold:
But, my desire is also, that ^^ey further
The Church affairs, in their own place and order:
And that they would be pleased (as hitherto
They g^avely were accustomed to do)
To check their busy Novices, who breed
Much scandal when unwisely they proceed.
For, though some threaten fearful things to those
Who dare a Parliamentall p^w'r enclose
Within a Bound: yea, though some talking things
(...), as if they might make and unmake Kings;
Coin new Religions; yea, and Gods, for need;
Yet, I shall never entertain their creed,
Nor fear, when good occasion I have got,
To say what may be done, or what may not.
For, they who make that power or more or less
Then ought to be, do equally transgress.
This, many Members, a^ some former sitting,
Not heeding, or else ove^much fo^getting,
Have scandalized that Meeting; and made bold
To run a great way fu^ther then they should
In their discourse (if not when they have sat,
Where they did matters publicly debate.
Yea, it is the property of most of those,
Who by their own procurement have been chose
For Knights or Burgesses, to stand it out
More boldly* and more obstinately slout,
For some fond custom, then for what befitteth
His Justice who in such a Counsel sits.
Of these they be, whose indiscretions bring
So many discontentments to the King,
Through want of more exp^rience, or sound reason;
Or by t^eir urging matters out of season:
And, such as these you easily may know
From wiser men. For, thus themselves they show.
If while a Session lasts you shall chance
To meet them, where themselves they do advance
In some discourse; assure your selves ye may,
By their perpetu^ll ta^ling, which are they.
For, they ingr^sse the talk, w^ere e're they come,
And speak, as if their lips naught flowed from
But Apothegmes; or, as if each cause
They undertook should pass among the Laws.
And, what another says, th^y'll ^o condemn.
As i^ a whole Committee spoke in them.
In my poor judgment it does much concern
Our Parliament^, that those their members learn
Mo^e silence: for, no sooner come they out*
But ev'rywhere they p^ate, and spread about
The secrets of the House; and blast them so
By their rank breathings, e're they ripe can grow*
That often they perish, or are shaken from
The tree, before the gathering time is come.
In this, our Peers I have not quite excused*
Nor said, that no ill customs they have used
In this great Meeting: For, the best have some
Blameworthy things (no doubt) if all should com^
To bide the censure: and, among the rest,
The voice by P^oxi* hold I not the least.
For, unto me, it does unfit appear,
To give my voice, until the cause I hear.
Who knows the hearts of other men so wel^*
Or, of their judgments, who the depth can tell,
So punctually, that (whatsoever shall
Proposed be) he trust them should in all?
Our own affairs (though wisdom says nay)
To other men we absolutely may
Refer to be determined on: but, that
Which does concern the gen^rall estate*
It were injustice, and a thing unfit,
To others, at adventure, to ^ommit.
For, most Selfe-lovers are; and we do know*
That many p^blike inju^ies may flow
From this one root; I will not say they do,
Although I think I might affirm that too.
Thi^ Custom seems ancient: and (if tol^
The truth may be) as evil as ti^ old:
And* from what cause soever it first did flow,
It wa^ not from the first beginning so
Nor, should old presidents (grown out of season)
Be followed, for their age, by m^n of reason:
Nor will this custom last, p^rchance, when they
Who may remove it, well the same shall weigh^.
For, I perce^ve it usefu^l to no end,
But indirect proceedings to bef^iend.
And, they whose courses are m^st indirect,
Are they that will such ^ustomes most prot^ct.
If this* and other errors yet unnamed,
Had well been heeded: some had more bin blamed,
Some less: some highly praised, who have seemed
Vnactive Mem^^rs, and been disest^emed.
Yea, thou had ^^lt most grievances amended
^'re this; and many troubles had been ended.
But now (what faults soever concurring be
In others) those defects that were in thee
Oh! England, were sufficient to procure
Those perturbations thou do yet endure.
Thy ove^-soone fo^getfulnesse of that
Great Pestilence affli^ting thee of late;
Thy thanklesnesse for Gods admired ceasing
That strong contagion* and the new increasing
Of thy transgressions, since his mercy daigned;
Deserves mo^e then thou have yet sustained.
Yea, that which thou were overseene in there,
W^ere thy Assembli^s cong^egated were
To ^ectifi^ thy self; even that, alas!
Suffi^ient to deserve these t^oubles was.
And therefore, w^ensoe're thy Sovereign shall
Be pleased, for thy help again to call
In such a public Meeting; let, in God,
Thy Knights and ^urgesses (now spread ab^oad)
Collect^d be: and, let not any from
Thy B^rroughes, by und^e election come*
Let Lords and Ladies letters, to such ends
Move none* but only, witness who are friends
To base corruption. Let their suits be scorned,
And, no respect unto them be retu^n'd.
Le^ every one of those that shall be sent
To represent thy Body; represent
Thy true repentance. Let them lay aside
Prejudicate opinion^, faction, pride;
And (to their utmost) in t^emselves restrain,
All those enormities which they retain:
That, setting to their own desires, a law,
They may the more enabled be to draw
A Rule for others. Let all they that come
To serve the Public, leave such thoughts at home
As merely private are: for, in them lu^ks
An enmity to all good public works.
Let none propose in such a Congregation,
What is not first prepared by consulta^ion,
For otherwhile, their precious hours are spent
About a needless tr^fling argument:
And, often, from matters of least moment spring
Those disagreeings which great harm ^o bring.
What their forefathers unto them did leave,
Let them not suffer any to bereave
Their children of. For, they may that deny
Even to their King, provided, loyally
They do it, in ^esi^ting his demands
By legal Pleading^; not by force of hands.
It ^s as Naboths Vineyard; and, to live
He merits not, who does repine to give
His life to save it: yea, accu^st is be
That would not zealous in those causes be.
Let them, therefore their ancient rights maintain,
By all just means: and let them yield again,
The royal dues. For, those things prosper not,
Which are, amiss, ^^om God, or Caesar got.
All wrongs shall be revenged: but none brings
Such vengeance, as the wrong to God, and Kings.
If but in word alone (nay, but in thought)
We have against our Prince committed ought
Which is disloyal, hid it shall no^ lie,
But, be revealed by a winged-spy.
Let* therefore, all just freedoms of the Land,
That can be proved, ^orth in public stand;
And not in old Records (half smothered lie)
In danger to be lost by casualty;
Or else embezel'd; or, by worms and dust
To be devoured: or, by those we trust.
Let us not whisper them, as men that fear
The claiming of their due, high treason were.
Nor let us (as we do) in co^ners prate,
As if the Sov'raigne power, or the State
Encroacht injuriously; and so defame
The government: disgrace the royal Name;
And nourish, by degrees, an evil spirit,
That us of all our peace will dis-inherit.
But, let us, if we see our ancient right
Inf^inged; bring our grievances to light,
Speak loyally, and orderly, and plain,
Those things which for our own we can maintain:
So, Kings the truth perceiving; and their ends
Who did abuse their trust, will make amends
^or all our sufferings: giv^ our foes their doom;
And make us more secure for times to come.
But, bring not, when ye come to plead with Kings,
(Against their claims) some bare conjectu^ings:
For, what thou have no ce^taine evidence
To be thy right: the right is in the Prince.
It is a royalty, to Mona^ks due,
But, if for any Freedom, ye can show
A Law enacted; or, a Custom old,
Or Presidents, that have not been controld
(As often as produced) ye may lay
Your clai^e; and keep it, every lawful way.
Each President, and every Demand
Which does from time to time opposed stand,
Concludes nothing This, let ^ach man heed,
And with a conscionable awe p^oceed
In such affai^es Let pure humility,
True piety, true love, and charity,
Be brought along And, when all these ^e bring,
Then go with l^yalty and m^et your King,
In his and your affaire^ without mistrust:
And then (as certainly as God is just)
In every due req^est ye shall prevail,
O^, gain some great advantage, if ye fail.
Desire of God to teach and guide you so,
That in this narrow path you straight may go.
If you would have a King be just to you,
Be ye upright, and to his honor true.
Yield first to him, i^ every fit demand,
And, long capitulating do not stand,
On what you may determinate with speed.
Because perhaps, delay may danger breed.
Af^ord him his requests, unto you^ powers;
Be his the fault, if he denies yours;
Or if miscounselled he shall re^u^re
What shall his weal oppu^ne, or your desire.
Go cast your selves before him with submission;
Present him with petition on petition.
With one accord, and with a fea^lesse face,
Inform him how much hindrance, or disgrace,
Or danger to the Land there may accrue,
If He your loyal counsel shall eschew.
For, God because his laws we disobey,
Us at our Sovereigns feet does mean to lay,
To humble us a while. If we repent,
To all our loyal suits he will assent.
If otherwise; God will give up this Land,
Our lives and freedoms all into his hand.
Go offer, while to offer you are free;
And what you give him, shall peace-offrings be;
If that which for atonement you provide,
With love and penitence be sanctifide.
The world against our State does now conspire;
Intestine dangers also, do require
That we in concord should united be,
And to supply the Kingdoms wants agree.
Lest while we st^ive, and fondly froward grow,
We be surprised by our common foe.
Unwise is he that in a dangerous place
Does stay to wash a spot out of his face,
When Outlawes he approaching hears, that may
His body wound, or take his head away.
If I should hear a Lion near me roar,
I Would arm my self, though I with wounds were sore,
And what I had not leisure then to cure,
Would seek to heal, when I of life were sure.
In times of trouble all must look for crosses;
And they must ^eare, who cannot shift their losses*
There may be smart by what we s^ffer shall;
But, better smart, then not to be at all.
When I do think a blow my head may harm,
I Will ward it off although it break mine arm;
For, though my arm be lost, yet I may l^ve;
But, on my head, a blow my death may give.
I am not so besotted, as to think,
We ought to give the wanton pall at drink,
Until the head be giddy, (left it may
Bring all the body head^ong to decay)
Nor praise I them that are so over-wise,
To spare what shall be need^ull to suffice
The general want (although to needless ends,
Some private h^nd, the public wealth dispends)
This, only, is the scope of my petition,
That all be done with love, and with discretion.
For, we must understand, that many things
Which are not just in us, are just in Kings;
And, that it is a kind ^f trait' rousnesse,
To give them more then due, as well as less.
They, who deny the King free power to do
What his Republikes weal conduces to,
Because some Law ga^nsayes; even those deprive
Their Sov'raigne of a due prerogative;
Since, for the common good, it just may be,
That some injustice may be done to me,
Or any few. Moreover, men that say
Kings may do more, then of true right they may,
And that no law does bound them; make a King
And him that is a Tyrant, all one thing.
In my opinion, these men are like those
Who in sweet meats, a poison do enclose
That kills a twelvemonths after. It Is as tho
We should affirm, that God may evil do
If so he please. It is a needless power
That serves for nothing, but to help devour
The owner. Yea, it is as if we should
Prepare our f^iend all instruments we could,
Wherewith if he should sick, or foolish grow,
He might have means himself to overthrow.
And they who to themselves this power do take,
Do silken halters, and gilt ponyards make
For their own throa^s: or, Nero-like to kill
Themselves, with poisons, golden viols fill.
For, though a ri^hteous King will never stray
From what is just (though none with hold him may)
Because he to himself becomes a L^w;
Yet, vicious Princes, thence, occas^on draw
To perpetrate that Act which them d^prives,
O^ kingdoms, lives, and all prerogatives.
And they that were as wise as Solomon,
Or as upright as David, being gone,
May leave a son or grandchild, as did they
Whose wilfulness shall cast t^n Tribes away.
And, then, their trait^rous couns^ll curse he will,
Who told him, he had power of doing ill.
For, though such Couns^llors may think they do
Their Sov'raignes honor, and much pleasure too,
In over straining their Prerogatives;
Yet are they to their Honor, States and Lives,
Egregious tra^tors; since a plot they lay,
Whereby their Princes shall themselves betray
To their own follies (if they vicious grow)
Yea, by this means they l^nd a pois^ned blow
To King, and Realm; which while the traitors live,
Will ea^e to some Impos^ume seem to give,
Or cure a wart, upon the body bred,
And, fester to the heart when they are dead.
Abhor ye these; and do not favor th^se
That would their King more n^rrowly enclose
Th^n shall be honora^le, or befits
His Majesty that as God's Viceroy fits.
When he compelled by necessities,
Requires of his people due supplies.
They must be had: although some oversight,
Forepast, may make it seem to wrong the right
And freedoms of the Land* We are not bound
To keep a Priviled^e, that shall confound
Both us and all our L^berties. They have
No blame, tha^ yield up what they cannot save
Without a greater loss: nay, wise is he
That serves on^ day, to be for ever free.
Your Wisdoms may, at ease, a course invent
To ple^se the King yet make no president
To future tim^s, from whence there shall arise
Infringement of our lawful Liberties;
Or to our Cause reproach: an^, to be taught
You need not, ^f together you were brought,
According to the freedom of e^ection:
For, no man then would need my poor direction.
But, th^re shall full be some that will in^rude,
And I for their instruction, am thus rude.
Some cry, The Land is poor, and cannot give.
It Is poor indeed: and yet I do believe
Few Kingdoms are so rich. ^is poor become,
Respecting that innumerable sum
O^ our arrear'd Repen^ance, yet u^paid.
It Is poor, if all our virtue should be weighed
With what is wanting: or, if we compare
Ou^ Worthies, living now, with such as were.
It Is poor, if we on those r^fl^ct our eyes,
On whom the labor of this K^n^dome lies:
Those people, whom our great and wealthy ones
Have rackt, oppressed, and eaten to the bones,
To fatten and ado^ne their carkesses;
The Land (I must confess) is poor in these.
Nay, if we should consider, what a rate
The richer sort among us lives at;
How many needless ways they do enlarge
(Without all temperance) their yearly charge:
And how each one his humor to enjoy,
Does emulate his friend in every toy.
Or, were it heeded well, how out of measure
Some wast their fortunes on a wicked pleasure;
Even (otherwhile) for that which for a bubble
Of Mirth, does bring them half an ages trouble:
Or, were it well observed what beggeries,
What shifts, what baseness, what necessities,
This brings on those that richest men are thought:
What costly suits and troubles it has brought;
And how indebted and ingag^d they stand
To one another quite throughout the Land.
These things, I say, consider^d, well we may
Affirm this Realm is beggarly: and say
The rich are poor. But, he this I Will belies
Who taxes it of other poverties.
Yes, he or blinded is, or makes l^sse
(To Gods dishonor) out of wilfulness,
His matchless bounty. What one Kingdom, yields
Through Europe, in barnes, granards, stalls, and fields,
Of Cattle and of Corn, in every kind,
More plenty, then among us, yet we find?
Where do their Gardens or their Orchards bear,
More fruits, for food or physi^^ then are here?
Our Sheep, fine wools enough afford us do,
To cloth ou^selves, and other nations too.
And, by their golden fleeces bring in sums
As la^ge, as any that from India comes.
Our B^es do gathe^ honey from our flowers;
Our Meads are fruitful by our April showers.
Within the Land rich Minerals do lie;
Our Air has Foul, in great variety.
In stately Palaces, we do abound;
With many Towns* our hills and dales are crowned:
In woods, and groves, this Kingdom has excelled,
(And, some yet stand though most of the^ are felled)
Fair Ports we have* sweet Rivers, and the Sea^
Surrounding us; and wealth comes in by these.
Our fruitful waters fish enough does yield
To feed us, though we had nor Grove, nor Field.
Yea did we riot less, and labor more,
Our Fish alone, would feed us all at shore.
If yet, this Kin^dome needy seem to be,
Go look upon her Cities, and there see
And mark, their costly Piles, their precious wares,
What choice, and store of rarities appears
Within their Magazines. Observe their state;
Their clothes, their jewels, furniture and plate;
And tell me, if they do not signify
That there is far more Pride, then poverty.
Gold, silver, pearls and diamonds do glare
And glitter in your eyesight, every where.
Himself disgraced the meanest Cobbler thinks,
Unless his Beer and Wine in Plate he drinks,
And eats in silver. Yea, the poorest ones
Must of that metal have their bowls or spoones:
On every thing, almost, pure gold is spilt.
The meanest instruments are hatched, or gilt.
Their Servants, in their garments are as gay,
As if that all the week^ were Holy day.
Their Feastings are abundant, and their pleasure,
Maintained is not, with a little Treasure.
But, Cities are the Treasuries you will say,
Wherein the Kingdoms riches up we lay
Survey the Country then, and tell me where
The rusticke villages replenisht are
With such fair booties. Other Kingdoms have
Their Cities, peradventure rich and brave,
But in their scattered Villages, we see
That few or none, save Peasants dwelling be,
Possessing nor good house, nor household stuff,
Nor comely Clothes, nor wholesome food enough.
Our Farms are stored with useful implements
Enough to purchase all the tenements,
And Lands in many foreign Realms, that are
As large as this our Country does appear.
Of iron, and of brass enough have we
To buy their gold. Our pewter should not be
Exchanged for their fi^v^r; if all were
Summed up, that is found with every Cottager:
Nay, there be many houses in this Land
That in remote obscurity do stand,
Which to the Foe would yield a richer prize
Then many Townships which they might surprise
On other shores: And yet, some do not shame
With poverty, this Island to defame.
WAR threatens us; and we of want complain,
Not knowing how our safeties to maintain:
Yet we do nothing want that may conduce
In war or peace, to serve a needful use.
Arms, victuals, men, and money we have store;
Yet, still, we falsely cry that we are poor.
We are so greedy, that we will not spare,
To save the hog, one farthing worth of tar.
Gods blessings we so long time have abused
That now we know not how they should be used.
Or else we think each other so unjust,
That no man knows with whom the means to tru^t.
Oh! pray to God, to take away the cause
Of these distempers; and to break the Maze
In which we wander. For, like those we fare,
Who sitting at a banquet, starved are.
If we had peace with God, and could agree,
This Kingdom which so needy seems to be,
Might with her superfluities maintain
Far greater armies, then the King of Spain,
With all his Indies. We might beggar him,
And make all who fear him, to contemn
His winning projects; if we had but eyes
To see and take the course that open lies.
It is his gold increasing his ambition,
Which to the Christian world will bring perdition:
And if prevention longer we delay,
(Or if we do not find a better way
Then yet is trod) the current of his power
Will grow so strong, that it will all devour.
For, w^ere a stream runs broad, and swift, to stop
His fury there, I see but little hope.
Materials both for war and peace, must come
To him from diverse quarters; for at home
His Country yields him little. But the year
As it renewes, with us, renews here
Our food and raiment; and though no supplies
Come in, a staple of Commodities
Our Island is, which both in war and peace
Will still be in request, and still increase.
Let therefore those who on the Continent
Do fear him, use their utmost to prevent
His greatness there; and let our Sea-gi^t I Will
(Forbearing on Land forces for a while,
To spend their strength) entirely bend their power,
(As in preceding times) the Seas to scour:
For, with more profit, and a lesser charge,
That shall our lost advantages enla^ge,
And, make his Armies, which are now so strong,
Draw ba^k, decay, and mutiny, e're long.
Were we resolved our course this way to bend,
Of our maine stock we needed not to sp^nd
One moitie. For, half of what is lost,
Within this Kingdom (saved) would quit that cost,
Let all, according to the port they bear,
Forbear but one vain Feast in every year:
Let every household, for the public wealth,
(Which also would advance the bodies health)
Fast but one meal a week, and separate
The price thereof, for service of the State:
Or spare from their full boards of flesh or fish,
The dressing, or the sauce, but of one dish:
Le^ us but lay one lace or guard the less
Upon our Clokes; or save the co^^l^nesse
In our ap^arell, which we well might spare,
Yet, no defect upon the same appear:
Let us ^ese^ve but half the ^ithe of those
^xpences trifled ou^ in gam^s and shows;
Which do not only needl^sse charge increase,
But still the kingd^me full of idlen^sse:
O^ these, and many other such expenses,
(Which wast our wealth, and multiply offenses)
I^ we but part would give; perhaps, that cost
Would save our lives, and all, from being lost.
Tobacco (which the age that went before,
Nor knew, nor needed) does expend us more
Then would maintain an army: for, few think
How much there is consumed in smoke and stink.
Pride is so c^stly, that if every Girl
Should give the worth but of one lace or purle,
Which trims her Cross cloth, it would sails provide
^or half the ships which now at Plymouth ride
H^d we but every forfeiture that is due,
^^om those of our notorious drunken crew;
Or, ^f the value were together got,
Although but of their twentieth needless pot,
I am persuaded it aflote would set
A greater Fleet then we have armed yet.
The very Oaths which we may daily hear,
(The men, the women, and the children swear)
If thundered forth together; would rore louder,
^hen all our Cannons: and, great shot and powder,
Much more then would at ^ea and land suffice,
Might purchas^ be, by half the penalties
Which might be justly taken; if we had
R^g^rd to execute the L^wes we made.
God grant that of his honor, and of what
Conce^nes the general safety of the State,
We may mo^e zealous grow; and that some course
May stop that mischief, which ye^ wax^th worse.
And that from this, or from some better light,
The means of ^eformation tak^ we might:
Of which I hopeful am, and that e're long,
Our Commonwealth shall sing a sweete^ song.
When such ^ time I see I shall be sure
T^es^ Lines, oh! England, will thy love procure;
And, I who for thy weal this pains bestow,
Shall find more favor then (...) for now*
Yea, then shall I that yet have been desp^s'd,
^ewa^led dye; o^, li^e much better prized.
But not till then: No^ shall I live to v^ew
Thy sorrows ended, ^ thou do not ^ue
Thy sins with speed* Oh! the (...) he
To turn ^o God, that he may t^rne to thee.
B^s^^ch him, England, to unclose thine eyes,
And let thee see in what thy sickness lies.
^mplore thou him to mollify thy heart,
Thy Children from their f^llies to divert,
And, break tho^^ chains of ignorance and sin*
Which at th^s present thou lie fetterd in.
Endeavor to be friends with God again:
And, he will all thy furious foes restrain^.
Thy faulty members, who do now disturb
Thy peace; he either will remove or curb.
Those G^ces thou perceivedst heretofore
Adorn thy Sovereign, shall be hid no more
By those dark fogs which from ^hy sins do rise,
For, God will take the skales from often th^ne eyes.
On thee, his countenance again shall shine;
That thou may la^d him in a Song divine:
And, they who now lament thy ^ad ^st^te,
In Hym^es of joy shall praise thy happy Fate.
The eighth Canto.
Our Poet having ^oucht again
Wh^t fr^il^ies in himself remain,
D^cl^res, that many Plagues do steal
As well on Church, as Commonweal:
Rel^tes wh^t cro^che^s do possess
Some, who Religionsn^sse profess:
What n^ysome ^lants, what tares and weeds,
A^e sprung, ^o choke the holy seeds:
Wh^t fai^ed zeal, and affectation,
H^th fooled this formal Generation:
And, how from some, great scandal grows,
Who ^eare the keys, that bind and loose.
Next, he delivers Predictions
Of plague, of sorrows and afflictions,
Which on this ^^and will descend,
Unless our manners we amend.
And, whenever civil j^rs,
Or mischiefs, by the rage of wars,
Oppress this Realm; his Muse does show*
Who shall occasion it; and how.
Which fearful Judgment to prevent,
He calls upon her to repent:
By ^en apparent signs, has shown,
Gods patience nigh expired is grown:
Then, for the Publike-wea^e, he prays:
Then, for himself; and, there he stays.
I Do not wonder, as I e^st have done,
That when the Prophet Jonas should have gone
To N^niveh, Gods word he disobeyed,
And would himself to Tha^sus have conveyed:
For, I have now a sense how flesh and blood
The motions of the Holy Ghost withstood,
And feel (me thinks) how many a likely doubt
The Devil, and his frailty, found him out
He was a man (thoug^ he a Prophet were)
In whom no little weakness did appear:
And, thus he thought, perchance, What shall I do?
Astrange at^empt my heart is ur^ed to:
And, there is somewhat, earnestly incites
That I should hasten to the Ninivites,
And, preach, that if they alter not their ways,
Their time of standing* is but forty days,
My soul persuades God injoynes me to it;
And sle^pe in peace, I cannot* till I do it:
B^t common Reason strivet^ to rest^aine
The motion, and p^rswade^ me it is in vain.
I^ says, I am a sin^er* and so frail,
That, many times, my best endeavors f^ile
To rectify my self. How shall I then
Be hopeful of recl^iming other men?
To Israel ^ have threa^ne^ many years
Gods judgments: yet, no fruit thereof appearess
Although the, have some knowledge of the Lo^d,
And are within his League, they slight ^is word:
What hope then is there, that a he^then Nation
Will prove regardfull of my exhortation?
The style of Prophet, in this land I carry,
And such a Calling, here, is ordinary;
But, in a foreign State, what warranty
Have I, to publ^sh such a Prophecy?
How may the King and People take the same,
If I shall in the open streets d^fame
So great a City? and, condemn for sin,
A place wherein I never yet have bin?
If I shall say, the Lord comm^nded me:
Then, they perhaps, will answer: What is he?
For, they profess him not. Nay, some suspicion
They may conceive, that I to mo^e sedition
Am sent among them. Or, if otherwise
They shall suppose; how can they but d^s^ise
My person, and my counsel, who shall from
So f^r a place, som^ere a stranger come,
That no man known, or what or who I am,
Or from what Countr^, or from w^om I came?
Such thoughts (belike) delayed* and feared him so;
And, so the Spirit urged him still to go
For N^niveh; that nor to go, nor stay,
Could he resolve: but, fled another way.
From which rebellious course, God fetched him back
With such a vengeance, that he did not lack
Sufficient proofs, how Reason did betray him,
And, in his Calling* causlesly aff ay him.
Yea (mark heavens providence) thou^h Io^as went
Another way, it crossed not God's intent,
But furthred it. For, doubtl^sse, e're he came
To Niniveh, the miracle and fame
Of his Deliverance, was s^nt before;
And, made his preaching work on them the more.
Now, though I do nor arrogate, nor dare
My self (except in frailties) to compare
With blessed Jonas: yet, I may be bold
To say, o^r Causes a resemblance hold*
My heart (and when that moves, as one averres,
It more prevails then many Counselors)
My heart (I say) persuaded me e're while,
To read a warning Lecture to this I Will.
And in such manner moved; that, to say
It came from God, me thinks, be bold I may.
Yet, my own natural frailty, and the world,
Among my ^houghts so many doubtings hurld,
That every step had rubs. I lev^ll'd some
In my last Canto. Yet, I could not come
To eaven ground, till I had overtopt
Some other Mountains which my passage stopped.
Beware, said Reason, how thou u^dertake
This hazardous adventure, which to make
Thou have resolved. For, this wise age denies
That God vouchsafed any Prop^^sies
Concerning them; or, that the application
Of ought for^told, pertains to this Nation.
She says, my Constancy is no true si^ne
That God first moved this intent of mine*
Since Hereti^ks, and T^aytors often are seen
As bold in all their causes to have been
As Martyrs be. And, that for what they d^e*
They can pretend the holy ^p^^it too.
And she pe^s^ades, it is likely I shall pass
(At best) for on^ that much deluded was
She saye^, more^ver, that if these times be
Indee^, so wicked, as they seem to me,
I shall in stead of movin^ to repent,
Naught else but stir their fury, and be rent
Perhaps in pieces, by their hasty ^^age.
For, what is more likely in a wicked age?
When people in their sins grow hardened once,
She says I may as well go talk to s^ones,
As tell them ought. For, they are in the dark;
And, what they see and hear, they do not ma^k.
She urged that the Prophets in old times
Did speak in vain against the peoples crimes;
And if in them their words began no faith,
Much less will such as mine, my Reason says.
She tells me also, that this I Will has store
Of Prophets, and of Preachers never more:
She says that thou^^ (...) calling none suspect,
Their pains appear to take but small ^ffect^:
And, if suc^ men authorized as they,
Do cast their words, without success, away;
In vain my Muse (whose warrant most contemn)
Does seek to work more piety in them.
A t^ousand things unto the like effect,
Yea, all and more then any can object,
(Who shall peru^e this Book) my Reason brought
Before me, and objected to my thou^ht.
And, as a Pilgrim (who occasions has
To take some extraordinary path)
Arivall making a^a double way,
Is doubtful whether to proceed or stay:
So fared I; I was nigh tired quite,
Before I could be c^rtaine of the right.
Yea, twixt my doubts, and all those replies
Which in my meditations did ari^e;
I so amazed grew, I could not know
Which way it best befitted me to go.
But, at the last, God brought me through all
My doubts and fears, as through the Storm and Wha^^,
Once Jonas came: That so, all they, who are
Ordained for their good, these Lines to hear,
The more may profit, when they think upon
What straits I passed, e're this work was done:
To that intent my frailties I h^ve so
Insisted on, as in this book I do.
Yea, I am hopeful also, they that read
These lines of mine (and mark with how much heed
And Christian awfulnesse, my heart was won
To censure and reprove as I have done)
Will plainly see, these Numbers flow not from
Fantastic rashness; nor from envy come*
Nor spring from faction; neither we (...)
By their distracted zeal, who (knowing not
What Spirit guides them) often are beguiled
With shows of truth; and madly have rev^led
Both good and ill: and whose unsavory Rimes
Defames men's persons more then che^k their crimes.
Dishonor Kings; their sacred names blaspheme;
And having gained some notions in a dream,
Or by report (of what they know not well)
Desire their gid^y thoughts abroad to tell:
In hope to merit: as in deed they do,
Sometime the pillory, and g^llowes too.
I trust, I say, these lines will seem no such;
Or, if they do, truth is* I ^are not much,
Because I certain am what pow'^ infused
Those matters, whereupon I now have muzed:
And know, that none will these or me condemn,
But they whose rage and follies I contemn.
Yet, that they may be sure I neither care
Who c^nsures me, nor what their censures are,
(When honest things I do) here, somewhat more
I Will add to what is mentioned before:
And give thee, Britain, a more perfect sight
Of thy distempers, and thy sickly plight.
Yea, thou shall know, I have not seen alone
A bodily Consumption ste^ling on,
And was^ing of thy Temporalties* but, that
I also have discovere^ ^f late,
A Lethar^y upon thy soul to steal:
And that as well the Church as Commonweal
Does need a cure. Oh! do not quite neglect
The good of both; but* one (at least) respect.
Though Iudahs sicknesses unheeded be,
(Although thy t^mporall wounds afflict not thee)
Yet* look on Syon: yea, behold and see
Thy Spiritual^ies* how much empair'd they be.
The Churches Pa^^^mony is decayed;
And many a one is in her spoils araid:
Those Patrons (as we term them in this age)
Who of her Dowries have the patronage,
Do rob and cheat her, many times of all;
And, their Donations basely set to sale.
Those Cananites, whom thou pres^rvest here,
(And by thy laws to be expelled were)
Are in thy borders now so multiplied,
That they are thorns and thistles in thy side.
They are become a Serpent in thy path,
Which bites unseene; and nigh unhorsed has
Some able Riders. On thy Places-high
Thy people do commit Idolat^y*
And rear strange Altars. In thy Fields are found
Those cunning harmfull Foxes to abound,
That spoil thy Vines. And, some I have espied,
Twixt whose oppo^ed t^les, are f^^ebrands ^y'd,
Which waste thy fruits. Thy Ha^v^st se^meth fai^e;
But secret blasting^ do so much impai^e
And blite the Corn; that when it come^ to bread,
Thy Childr^n often unwholsomly are fed.
Men use Religion as a stalking-horse
To catch preferment; yea, sometime to wor^e
And baser uses they employ the same;
Like that bold Harlot, who quite, (...)
Did of her Vows, and her Peace of^^ngs make
A sin, lascivious customers to take.
Yea, some (resembling him, from whom was cast
One Devil) when one sin they ^ave d^splac't*
Of which the world took notice, sw^ep and ^l^nse
Themselves (in show) from a^l their other si^s;
Yet secretly, let Satan reposs^sse,
And foul^ them with a seve^-fold wi^kedne^^^.
An univ^rsall dullness will ^enu^
Thy senses, if thou do not soon become
More heed^ull of thy state, then thou a^t yet:
For, ev'^y part has ^elt an ague-fit.
Thy Academs, which are the famous places
In which all pious knowledges and graces
Should nourisht be* and whence thy chief supply
Of Teachers, com^, (as from a Nurse^y)
Even those fair ^ountaines are much tainted grown,
With doctrines hardly found, which thence are blown
Through ev'^y quarter. In their Schools are heard
Vain ^^ggs and jangling^, worthless of regard.
The ^very Pulpi^s, and their Oratories,
Are Stages, whereupon their own vainglo^ies
Men often act. Yea, many a vain conceit,
Is brought in stead of arguments of weight:
And (which is worse) disorder is so rise
Among them; and the weeds of evil life
Have so o'regrowne those Gardens, that (unless
Good government shall speedily redress
That spreading mischief) it will overtop
The plants of Syon, and destroy her crop.
To be thy Shepherds, Wolves are stolen in*
And, thou have those who even by day begin
To sow their Tares among thy purest Se^d;
And, with mixed Grains thy Lands pollution breed.
For hire and money* prophesies the Prophet:
The Priest does preach, to make a living of it,
Even merely for a living; and, ^ut few
Their holy charge, for conscience sake pursue:
Which I by many signs could make apparent,
But that it is not yet within my Warrant.
Loq^untur C^rae leves* little Cures
Do (...) preach, whilst poverty endures.
Ing^nt^s s^upent; but, large livings make
Our Doctor^ dumb: condemn not my mistake:
For, though I do the Lat^ne sent^nce wrong,
That Is true I tell ^ou in the English ^ongue.
Our N^tion, which of l^te prophanenes^e ha^ed,
Is in that sin almost Itali^nated.
The Scriptures without reverence are used:
The ho^y phrase, in jestings* is abused:
To flout, or praise, or cu^se, we ^an apply
Gods holy word, most irrel^giously:
Instead of Emblem^s, moving thoughts divi^e,
The filthy pictures of lewd Aret^ne,
Are found in many Clossets. Foolishlies,
Profane and most lasciviou: Ele^^es
Are public made. Yea, those whom heretofore
A heathen Emperor did so abhor,
That he* for them, their wanton Author sent
To undergo perpetual banishm^nt:
Even these, we read; and worse then those, by far,
All^wed pass, and unreproved are.
Nay, their vain Authors often cherisht be:
At l^^st, they have the favor to go free.
But, if a graver Muse reprove their sin,
Lord, with what hasty zeal they call it in!
How libellous they make it! and how vile,
Thou know; and at their fol^y thou do smile.
Full war^ly, the politic Divi^e,
(Who should allow it) scanneth every Line
Before it pass; each phrase he does su^pect;
Although he finds nothing to be chekt,
He fears to License it And if by chan^e
It pass abroad, forthwith does ignorance
Mistake or mis^pply; and false and bade
Constructions are, of good expressions made.
Yea, they who on the ^ea^s of Iud^emen^ fit,
Are o^t, most ready, to miscensure it.
I would they were as fo^ward to disgrace
Those Autho^s, who have filled every place
With fruitless Volumes. For d^spersed are
Even qui^e throughout this Island every year,
Even many thousand Reames of scurri^e toys,
Songs, Rymes and ^allads, whose vain use destroys
Or hinders Virtuous knowledge, and D^votion.
And this we do to f^^ther the promotion
Of our Diana. Yet, behold, if we
To publish some few sheets required be,
Containing pyous Hymns, or Christian Songs,
Or ought which to the praise of God belongs:
We do so fear the hindrance of our gain,
That like the Ephesian Silver-smiths, we feign
A great complaint. As if to have enlarged
A little Book, had grievously over charged
The Common-weal^h. Whereas if it were weighed,
How much o^ late this Land is overlaid
With ^^iviall Volumes: ^r, how much they do
Corrupt our Manners, and Religion too,
By that abusive matter they contain;
I should not seem unjust^y to complain^
These times do swarm with Pamphlets which be far
More dangerou^, then mo^tall poisons are
Even in thos^ books, whereby the simple thought
To fi^d t^u^ knowledge they their Bane have caught:
For, thence, strong Heresies (there b^ing hid
Amid some doub^l^sse Truths, a while unspid)
Steal out among the people, by degrees;
More mis^hi^fe working then each Reader sees.
And, so, to ruin knowledge* that is made
An instrum^nt; whereby it rais^ng had
For (by their lucre, who the Chu^ches peace
D^sturb, their p^ivate profit to encre^se)
Those Doctrines which are unauthori^ed,
Are so promiscuously divulged, and spread,
Among approved V^rities; that some
Are in those Lab^rinths amazed become:
And* such a Contradiction is in that
Which their confused Pamphlets do relate;
That, Common Readers, know not which to leave,
Nor, which the Church of England does receive.
And, from this mischief many others flow,
Which will, in future tim^s, more ha^mfull grow.
This, spins vain Controversies to their length;
By this, most Heresies receive their strength.
And what distraction it already makes,
Our grieved Mother woeful n^tice taken.
In stead of active knowledge, and her fruit*
This fills men with itching^ of dispute,
And empty words; whereby are set abroach
A thousand quarrels, to the Truths reproach.
The Sectaries, the Mun^ey^s, and the Apes,
The Cubs and Foxes, which do mar o^r Grape^;
The Wolves in sheepskins, and our frantic rabble
Of Worship-mongers, are innumerable.
And, as the Churches quiet they molest,
So they each other spightfully infest.
We have some Papists: some that half way go:
Some Semi-puritans; some* w^olly ^o;
Some Anabap^ists; some, who do refu^e
Black puddings; and good porke; like a^rant I^wes:
Some also termed Arminians are among
Our Priests and People, very lately sprung.
What most, so called, profess, I stand not for:
And what some say they teach, I do abhor*
^ut, what some other, so misnam'd, believe,
Is that whereto best Christians credit give.
For, as we see the most reformed man,
By Libertines, is termed ^ Puritan:
So (by our purblinde Formalists) all those
Who new fantastic crotchets do oppose,
Begin to be mis-term'd Arminians now.
And, hence e're long will greater mischieves grow
Then most imagine. For, the foolish fear,
Lest they to be Arminians may app^are,
Or else be termed Puritans, will make
Great multitudes Religion quite forsake.
And, I am h^lfe persuaded, thi^ will on^
Of those great Schisms (or ea^^hquakes) cause which (...)
Foretold in his Apocalypse; and they
Are bl^st, who shall not thereby fall away*
Some Brownists, and some Familists have we;
And some, that no man can tell what they be;
Nor they themselves. Some, seem so wondrous pur^
They no men's conversations can endure,
Unless they u^e their plaistrings, and appear
In every formal garb which they sh^l^ w^are*
The^e be of those who in their words de^y,
And hate the practice of Idol^try,
Yet make an Idol of their form^l^ z^ale,
And underneath strict holin^ss^, c^nceale
A mystery of evil, which dece^ve^ them,
And, when they think all ^a^e in danger le^ves them*
Their whole Religion, some d^e pla^e in hea^i^g:
Some, in the ou^w^^d action o^ fo^b^aring
Ill deeds; or in well doing* though the heart
In that performance bear ^o ^eall part.
Some othe^s, of th^i^ mo^^ll action, make
Small conscience: and, affirm that God does take
No notice how in body they transgress,
If him they in th^i^ inward man conf^sse:
As i^ a soul beloved could reside
Wit^ in a body quite unsanctifi^e.
Some, not contented in the ^ct of sin,
Are grown ^o impudent, that they begin
To justify th^ms^l^es in wickedn^sse;
Or, by quaint ^rguments, to make it less:
And, by such Monsters, to such ends as this,
The Christian-liberty defamed is.
N^w fanglednesse, Religion has o'rethrowne;
And, many as fantastica^l are grown
In that as in ^pparell. Some, deligh^
In nothing more then to be opposite
To other men: Their zeal they wholly spend
The present Government to reprehend;
The Churches discipline to v^lifie;
And rail, at all, which pleads Antiquity.
They love not peace: and therefore have suspicion
Of Truth it self, if out of persecution:
And are so thankleffe, or so heedlesse be
Of Gods great love, in giving such a free
And plenteous means of publishing his word,
That, what his Prophets of the Jews record,
Some verefie in us. Much praise is given
To that b^inde age, wherein the Queen of heaven
Was worshipped here. And, f^lsly, we ^xtoll
Those Days, as being much more plenti^ull.
Some, at the frequency of Preach^ng gru^ch,
And, tired with it, think we have too much:
Nay, impudently practice to suppr^sse
That Exercise, and make our plenty less.
And, that their d^ings may not want some ^ayre
Or goodly coulor, they do call for Prayer,
In stead thereof; as if we could not pray,
Until our Preaching we had sent away.
As these are foolishly, or lewdly, wise*
We have some othe^s wantonly precise.
So way wardly disposed, amidst our plenty,
And through their curiosity, so dainty;
That, very many cannot w^ll dig^st
The Bread of life, but in their m^nner dressed.
Now will Gods Manna, or that measure serve
Which he provides; But, they cry out they starve,
Unless they feed upon their own opinions,
(Which are like Egypts Ga^licke and her Oynions)
Some like not Prayer that is ext^mporary*
Some love not any t^a^ s^t fo^me (...) ^ary.
Some think there is no devotion, but in those
That howl, or whine, or snuffle in the no^e;
As I that God vouchsafed all his Graces
For ^^ined gestures, or for sour faces.
Some think not that the man, who gravely teaches,
Or has a sober gesture when he preaches,
Or gentle voice: has any zeal in him,
And therefore, such like Preachers they contemn.
Yea, they suppose that no man's doctrine saves
The soul of any one, unless he raves,
And rores aloud, and flings, and hurleth so
As if his arms he quite away would throw;
Or over-leap the Pulpit; or else break it:
And this (if their opinion true may make it)
Is to advance their voices Trumpet-like*
A^ God commands: yea, this (they say) does strike
Sin dead. Whereas, indeed, God seldom goes
In whi^lwinds: but is in the voice of those
Who speak in meeknes. And it is not in
The power of ^oyse to shake the walls of sin:
For clamors, ^ntique actions, writhed looke^*
And such like mi^^micke Rhetoric none brooke^
That has discretion: neither does it move
The heart of any, when we so reprove;
Ex^ept it be in some contrary motion,
Which interrupts the hearers good devotion.
The well aff^ct^d Christian pit^ies it;
It makes prophanest men (...) naught to set
God^ O^dinance. Mee^e mor^ll men despise
Such affectation: much it ter^^ies
The ignorant: but very few srom thence
Rece^ve sound knowledge, or ^ive penitence.
Some relish nothing, but those points th^^ are
In controversy: some would nothing hear
But songs of Mercy; some, del^^h^ i^ none
But Sons of Th^nder; and sc^rc^ any one
Is pleased in what he hears. Nay, of th^i^ Preachers,
M^cha^^^k arroga^e to be their teachers.
Yea most of us, what (...) our Pastor says,
Keep sti^l ^ur own opinions and our ways.
To hear and know Gods word, to some among
Our Nation, seems only to belong
To Clergymen; and, their implicit Faith
Is built on what the common rumor says.
Some others filled with curiosity
Affirm that every several mystery
Within Gods Book included, does concern
Even each particular Christian man to learn:
Whereas they might as well affirm, each guest
That is invited to a public Feast,
Is bound the several dishes there to heed,
And upon every meat before him feed.
Nay, some have almost this imagination,
That there is hardly hope of their salvation*
Who speak not Hebrew. And, this now adays,
Makes foolish women, and young Prentises
To learn^ that holy Tongue* in which they grow
As cunning as do those who nothing know,
Save to be arrogant, and to cont^mne
Those Pastors, who have taken charge of them.
The appetite of some grows dull, and ^ailes,
Unless it may be pampered with Quails;
High flying crotchets, which we see d^ fill
Not half so many soul^s as they do kill
We cannot be content to make our flights,
For that which God exposes to our sights,
And search for that which he is pleased to show,
But, we must also p^y, what God does know.
W^i^h ^as inde^d an a^c^ent fallacy
O^ Satan's; and the v^^y same whereby
He cheated Eve. From seeking to disclose
Beyond our warrant, what God only knows,
Proceeds many erro^s. Thence does come
Most questi^ns that have troubl^d Christendom.
Yea, searching things concealed, has overthrown
The comfo^table use o^ what is known.
Hence flow^s their fruitless fond asseveration,
Who blundred on Eternal Reprobation,
And many groundless whimsies have invented,
Whereby much better muzings are prevented.
Of Reprobation I no doubt have made;
Yet, those vain quarrellings which we have had,
Concerning her, and her antiquity,
(But that the world has wise^ fools then I)
Appears to me to bring so little fruits,
That I suppose i^ fitter for disputes
In hell (among the reprobated ^rue)
Then for a Church of Christians to pursue:
At least to braule about wi^^ ^^ch hot rage,
As has poss^^^ so^e ^p^rits of this age.
For, some have u^g^d this p^^nt of ^e^^obation,
As if the chi^^e^^ ground-w^^k of salvation
Depended on ^^^e^ving, just, as they
(Deluded by their fancies) please to say.
And, though they never found God^ holy wo^d
Did any mention of the same affo^d,
But, as of that which did begin since Time;
And with respect to some committed crime:
They, nathelesse, their strengths together gather,
To prove the Child is older then the Fat^er.
And, since that f^tall thr^d, there, finds her spinning,
But from of Old; at fa^thest from B^ginning:
They Reprobation, otherwhile confound
With our Predestination: which is found
No where in all the Scripture* to ^e^pect
The Reprob^tes, but ^nely Gods Elect.
And then they are compeld to p^ove the sense
Of their dar^e Tenet, by an inference;
And to affirm (from ^eason) that Election
Eternal, does infer the like ^ejection.
(As if an action of Eternity,
Were fit to square out shallow reasons, by)
Which A^gument because it has not taken
True Faith, to ground on, may with ease be shaken*
Their tottering structure, therefor, up to keep,
They into Gods fore know^edge boldly peep,
Beyond his warrant; searching for Decrees
And secrets, farther then an Angel sees:
Presuming then, ^s if all things they knew,
And had Eternity within their view.
But, that has such an infinite extension,
Beyond their narr^w-bounded comprehension,
That, th^^e they wa^^er on, ^ill they are madd:
And (...) little knowledge which they had:
For ^spa^ they but m^^ men who maintain
The g^^di^-^^^cies of their own weak brain,
For Theses of Religion, which we must
Believe as they affi^me t^em, or be thrust
Among the Repr^bates? What less, I pray,
Are they then m^d^, who fool^ their wits away
In wheeling Arguments which have no end?
In ^traines which man shall never apprehend?
In seeking what their knowledge do^^ exceed?
In vain disputings, which contentions breed.
In strange Chymera's, and fantastic notions,
That neither stir us up to good devotions,
Nor mend our manners? But our w^yes pervert,
Distract the Judgment, or puff up ^he heart.
If this I may not ^adnes call, or folly,
It Is (all the best) religious-melancholly.
What shall we judge of those who strive to make
Gods word (who^e Terms and Scope they much mistake
Their proofs for that wh^reof no proofs they are,
And slight these Truths, for which the text is clear*
What shall we deem of these, who quite mistaking
Good Authors, (and their Volumes guilty making
Of what they never meant) do preach and write
Against those Books, with rancorous despite,
Which being well examined, say the same
Which they affirm, and check what they do blame.
Such men there be, and they great noise have made
By fighting furiously with their own shade.
What may b^ thought of them, who likely, ever,
In their perverse opinions to persever,
Take knowledge up on trust: and follow those
Who lead them on, as wild-ge^^e fly in ^owes?
And when their multitude is waxen great,
Do then so wilfully prejudicate,
Become so confid^nt of that they hold,
And in their blind assurance, so are bold,
That they can brook no tryal^, neither see
Their oversights, how plain so ere they be?
But fondly think (though we believe it not)
That they infall^^ilitie h^ve got?
Some pious men; yea, some great Doctor^ tread,
Such Loabrinths; and often are misled
By holding that which they at first were taught,
Without due proving all things as they ^ught:
And vulgar men are often led awry,
By their examples and for company.
For, as a Trav^ller, that i^ to come
From some far Count^y, through large deserts, h^me*
(Not knowing well the way) is glad to take
His course with such who shows of cunning make,
And walks along, d^pending s^ill on them,
Through many a wood, an^ over many a stream,
T^ll he and they are loft: there to remain
He finds no safety, nor means back again,
Nor list to leave his company; because
He hopes that nearer homeward still he draws,
And that his guides full sure of passage are,
Although they cannot well describe it, there.
So, when plain men do first attempt the way
Of knowledge, by their guides, they walk as^ray,
Without distrust; and when ariv'd they be
Where many troublesome windin^'s, they do see,
And where no certainty they can b^h^ld,
Yet, on their leaders knowledge they are bold,
O^ on their multitude* yea, though they know,
And, see them err, and ^u^ne, and stagger so,
(In da^ksome paths) that well suppose they may,
They rove and wander in an unc^uth way;
Yet, still they are unwilling to suspect
The wild me of the Fathers of their Sect.
Yea, though no satisfaction they can find,
Though fear, and doubtings ^o affl^ct their mind,
They still impute it rat^er to their own
Infirmities, or to the depths unknown
Of those mysterious points, to mention brought;
But never call in question what is taught:
Lest being by those Teachers terrifide,
They might forsaken in d^^p^i^e abide.
Their Doctors, also, fail^ng to d^vise
Strong Arguments, their h^arers to suffice;
This course, to salve their credits, la^e have ^ot;
They say (forsooth) Faiths doctrine ^eules not
With natural capac^^ies; and that
The Spirit must those men illuminate
Who shall receive them* And, indeed in this,
They do both say the truth, and say amiss:
This is a lesuitish juggling trick,
And, if allowed it be, each lunatic,
And every brainsick Dreamer, by that way,
May foist upon us all that he can say.
For, though Gods holy Spirit must create
New hearts within us, and regenerate
Depraved nature, e're it can be able
To make our outward hearings profitable;
We must not think that all which fancy says
(In terms obscure) are mysteries of Faith.
Nor make the hearers want of power to reach
Their meanings, to be proofs of what they teach.
There is twixt ^en, and that which they are taught,
Some natural proportion* or it is naught*
The deepest mystery ^f our profession,
Is capable of literal expression,
As well to R^probates, as men elected;
Or else it may of error be suspected
Yea wicked men a power granted have
To understand, although they miscon^eive.
And can of d^^kest points make plain relations,
Though to themselves they fail in applications.
God never yet did bid us take in hand
To publish that which none can understand:
Much less affecte^h he a man should mutten
Rude sounds of that* whose depth he cannot utter;
Or in uncertain terms as many do,
Who preach Non sense, and often nonentia too.
For those which man to man is bound to show,
Are such plain Truths, as we by word may know;
Which when the hearer can express again,
The fruit has equalled the Teachers pain.
Then, though the soul does many ^imes conceive
(By Faith, and by that Word which we receive)
Deep mysteries, and that which far transcends
A carnal knowledge: though she a^prehends
Some glimmerings of those Objects, that a^e higher
Then humane Reason ever shall a^pire;
Though she has tastings of that blesse^n^s,
Which mortal tongue could never yet express;
And though the soul may have some earn^st g^ven
On earth, of what it shall enjoy in heaven;
Though God may when he list (and now and then
For cause not ordinary) to some men
Vouchsafes (for their secret satisfactions)
A few reflections from eternal^ actions:
T^ough this be so, let no man arrog^te
That he such sec^ets can by word relate.
For, they are things* of which no voice can preach;
High flights, to which no mortal wing can reach;
It Is Gods own work, such raptures to convay,
To compass ^h^m there is no other w^y,
But by his blessed Spirit. And, of those
Most can we not; some must we not disclose
For, if they only touch out pri^ate state,
They were not sent, that we should them relate*
But d^igned that the soul they stren^then might
Amid the perils of some secret fight;
When men to honor God, or for their sin,
The terrors of this life are glun^ed in.
And, as it i^ reputed of those things.
Which foolish people think some Fairy b^ings.
So, of Euthusiasmes speak I may;
Discover them, and straight ^hey fly away.
For* thus they fare who boast of Revelations,
Or of the certainty of their Salvations,
Or any ghostly gift, at times or places,
Which warrant not the mention of such graces:
Yea, by revealing things which they should hide,
They entrance make for overweening p^ide,
And that quite marres the blessing they possessed,
Or, for a while, obscureth it, at best:
And yet, if any man shall climb so high,
That they attain unto a Mystery,
Co^ceiv'd by few; they may, if they be able,
Dis^lose it where it may b^ profitable,
But, they must know, that (if it be, indeed,
Of such transcendency, as does exceed
Mee^e natural reaches) it should be declared
To none, save unto those who are prepared
For such conceptions; and more apt to know them
By their own thoughts, then are our words to show them.
Else, all they utter will in clouds appear,
And, errors men for truths, away will bear.
Would this ha^ been observed a little more,
By some who in our Congregations roar
Of Gods unknown Decrees, Eternall-Callings,
Of Perseverance, and of Final, Fallings,
And such like Mysteries* Or else, I would
That they their meanings better utter could,
(If well they meant.) For, though those points afford
Much comfort and instruction (as Gods word
Has mentioned them) and may applied be,
And opened, when we just occasion see;
Yet, as most handle them, who now adays
Do pass for Preachers, with a vulgar praise*
They profit not: for, this ripe age has young
And forward wits, who by their fluent tongue,
And able memories, a way have found
To build a house, e're they have laid the ground.
With common places, and with notes purloin'd,
(Not well applied, and as ill conjoined)
A garb of preaching these have soon attained,
Which has, with many, approbation gained
Beyond their merit. For, they take in hand
Those mysteries, they neither understand,
Nor studied on. And, they have much distracted
Some hearers, by their doctrines ill compacted:
Yea, by enquiring out what God fore-sees,
And meddling much with his unknown Decree^,
The Churches peace so much disturbed have they;
So foul and crooked made Faiths plainest way;
Such scandals raised; and interrupted so.
By doubts impertinent, what men should do;
And, their endeavors nullifide, so far,
That many of them at a nonplus are.
I am not of their minds, who take from this
And other things, that are performed amiss,
O^casion to disparage frequent preaching;
Or, to abate our plentiousnesse of teaching:
For, of our Harvest, Lord, I humbly pray,
The store of Laborers continue may.
And, I could also wish, that none were chose
To be a seed man, till he truly knows
The Wheat from Tares; and is indu'd with reason,
And grace, to sow in order, and in season.
And that those a^tlesse workmen may be staid,
W^o build before foundations they have laid^*
Lest, when our Church well built, suppose we shall,
It sink, and overwhelme us in the fall.
It pities me to mark what rents appear
Within our Syon; and what daubings are
To hide the ruins; and I fear the frame
Will totter, if we long neglect the same.
Our Watchme^, for the greater part, are grown
Less mindful of Gods honor, t^en their own:
For either almost wholly we omit
That work, or undiscreetly follow it.
Some, speak the truth, without sincere intention,
As they who preach the Gospel for contention.
Some, by their wicked lives do give offense,
And harden men in their impenitence.
As if nor hell nor heaven they did believe,
They riot, game, drink drunk, and whore, and theeve.
For avarice, and envy, none are worse;
They are malicious, and blaspheme, and curse,
As much as any others. None are more
Regardlesse of the soul that is mean and poor;
Among their neighbors, none more quarrelsome,
Or, that more hardly reconciled become,
Then many Clergymen. And as we see
They are the best of mon, when good they be;
So, there are none that wander more astray,
When they have left a sanctified way.
Some Pastors are too hot; and some too cold;
And, very few the golden temper hold.
Some, at the Papist with such madness fling,
As if they could not utter any thing
Of them too vile; though never so false it were:
And, we so used by their Jesuits are.
Some others at the Puritan do strike,
So furiously, that they are often like
To wrong the Protestants: for, men impose
That name, sometime, upon the best of those.
Yea, they who are profane, that name mis-lay
On all who make a conscience of their way.
Some Shepherds, on their Flocks are go^g'd at full,
And sumptuously arrayed in their wool.
But, those that are diseased, they make not strong;
Their sickliest sheep they seldom come among;
They take no care, the broken up to bind,
The Sheep that is lost, they do not seek to find;
They let such wander as will run ast^ay;
And, many times their fury so does f^ay
The tender conscience; that their in^iscretion
Does fright their hearers headlong to perdition.
Gods bounty has large pastorage provided;
But, they have not his flocks with wisdom guided:
For, in the midst of plenty, some be ready
To starve in ignorance. Some sheep are headdy;
Some get the staggers; some the scab; and they
Infect their fellows. Some, the wantons play
Among the thorns and briars, which have torn
The marks and fleeces, which they should have worn.
Some straggle from the flock; and they are straight
Surpised by Wolves, which lie for them in wait.
Some, sought large feeding, and ran^k pastures got,
Which proved not wholesome; and they caught the Ro^.
For, many preach themselves, and fancies broach,
That scandal preaching, to the Truths reproach.
Yea, some term that (forsooth) Gods word divine,
Which would half shame me, should they term it mine.
And they we see, that longest pray and speak
Are prized of most (though head nor foot they make)
Because the common hearers of this land,
Think best of that, which least they understand.
Some, also, by their feet disturb the Spring^;
Or trample and defile Gods pasturings;
And they are either such who make obscure
Faiths p^inciples; or, such who^e lives impure
Profane their Doctrines. Other some have we,
Who (like the beasts that over gamesome be)
Do push their ^eaker brethren with their horns*
And hunt them from the flock, by wrongs, or scorn.
Gods horses, also, much neglected are;
And of his Sanctuaries, few have care.
A barn, or any common house, or room,
Is thought as well Gods worship to become,
As in the Churches infancy; or there,
Where wants, and wars, and persecutions are.
Amidst our peace and plenties, we do grutch
Our Oratories should be trimmed as much
As are our vulgar dwellings; and repine
That exercises which are most divine,
Should with more Rites, or Ornaments, be done,
Then when the troublous times afforded none.
As if a Garden, when the flowers are blown,
Were still to look as when it first was sown.
To worship so in spirit, we pretend
That, in our bodie^, we do scarcely bend
A leg, or move a cap, when there we be,
Where Gods most holy Mysteries we see.
Yea, many seem so caref^ll to have bin,
To let no Superstition enter in,
That they have, almost, wholly banished hence,
All Decency, and pious Reverence.
The Church, by Lukewarme-Christians, is neglected
By brutish Athe'sts it is disrespected;
By greedy Worldlings, robbed of her fleeces;
By selfe-will'd Schismatics, nigh torn in pieces;
By Tyrants, and by Infidels opposed;
By her blind Guides, to hazard often exposed;
By Hypocrites, injuriously desamed;
And, by the fr^ilties of the best, often shamed.
A power ecclesiastical is granted
To them, full often, who those minds have wanted
Becoming such Authority: and they
Play fast and loose, even with the Churches Key.
They censure and absolve, as best shall make
For their advantage; not for consc^ence sake.
As they shall please, they punish or connive;
And, by the peoples follies they do thrive.
Of evil customs, many are we see
Insinuated, and so strict are we
To keep them, that we sottishly deny
To leave them, for what more would edify:
And we so much do Innovations fear,
That needful Reformations no^e appear.
We have prophan^d every holy thing;
Even out most Christian ^^asts, which are to bring
God^ Mercies to our thou^^t; and memorize
Of Saving-Grace, the sacred Mysteri^s:
Some have ev^n those gain-sayed; and, in that
Have evil spoken, of they know not what.
Some others keep them; but, as heathnishly,
As Feasts of Bacchus; and impiety
Is then so rife, that God is rarely named
Or thought upon, except to be blasphemed.
By these, and other ways, the church does lose
Much honor, to the glory of her so^s,
And our great sham^ and loss: for, her decays
Shall be this Realms disprofit, and dispraise.
God has a controversy with our La^d;
And, in an evil plight affairs do stand.
Already we do smart for doing ill;
Yet, us the hand of God afflicts still,
And many see not; as many be
So wilful, that his hand they will not see.
Some, plainly view the same, but nothing care:
Some, at the sight thereof amazed are
Like Balthazar; and have a trembling heart,
Yet, will not from their vanities depart.
About such matters, other some are loath
Their thoughts to busy (merely out of sloth)
Like him, who rather would in hazard put
His life, then rise from bed the door to shut.
Some, dream that all things do by chance succeed,
And that I prate more of them then I need.
Bu^, Heav^^ and Earth, to witness I invoke,
That, causlesly, I nothing here have spoke.
If this, oh sickly Island, thou believe,
And for thy great infirmity shall grieve,
And, grieving of thy follies make confessions;
And so confess thine infinite transgressions,
That thou amend those errors: God shall then
Thy manifold distempers cure again;
Make all thy skarlet sins as white as snow,
And cast his threatened judgment on thy foe.
But, if thou (fondly thinking thou a^t well)
Shall slight this Message, which my Muse does tell,
And scorn her counsel; If thou shall not rue
Thy former ways; but, frowa^dly pursue
Thy wilful course: then, hark what I am bold,
(In spite of all thy madness) to unfold.
For, I will tell thy Fortune; which, when they
That are unborne, shall read, another day;
They will believe Gods mercy did in^^se
Thy Poets breast with a prophetic Muse.
And know, that he this Author did prefer,
To be from him, this Isles REMEMBRANC^R.
If thou, I say, oh Britain! shall retain
Thy crying sins, thou do presume in vain,
Of Gods protection. If thou stop thine ear,
Or burn this Roll, in which recorded are
Thy just Inditements; it shall written be
With new additions, deeply stamped on thee
With such Characters, that no time shall race
Their fatal image, from thy scarred face.
Though haughtily thou do thy self dispos^,
Because the Sea thy borders does enclose.
Although upon the Rocks thy neast is placed;
Though thou among the Stars thy dwelling have;
Though thou increase thy ships; and unto that
Which is thine own, with King Iehosophat,
Join Ahabs forces. Though thou watch and ward,
And all thy Ports and Havens strongly guard;
Although thou multiply thy inland forces,
And muster up large troops of men and horses*
Though like an Eagle, thou thy wings display'st,
And (high thy self advancing) p^oudly say;
I sit aloft, and am so high, that none
Can ^etch me from the place I rest upon.
Yea, though thou no advantages did want,
Of which the glorioust Emperies did vaunt;
Yet, sure, thou shall be humbled and brought low;
Even then, perhaps, when least thou fear it so.
Till thou repent, provisions which are made
For thy defense, or others to invade,
Shall be in vain; and still, the greater cost
Thou shall bestow, the honor that is lost
Shall be the greater; and thy wasted strength,
Be sick of a Consumption, at the length.
Thy Treaties, which for peace or profit be,
Shall neither peace, nor profit, bring to thee.
Or, if thy Counsels prosper for a while,
God will permit it, only to beguile
Thy foolishness; and tempt thee on, to run
Some courses, that will bring his Judgment on.
Yea, all thy winnings shall but fuel be,
To feed those follies that now spring in thee;
And make (with vengeance) those the more enrag'^
Who shall for thy correction be engaged.
What ever threatened in Gods Book ha^h bin,
Against a wicked people for their sin,
Shall come on thee: His hand shall be for ill,
On every Mountain, and high-raised Hill.
Thy lofty Cedars, and thy sturdy Oake^,
Shall feel the fury of his thunder-stroakes.
Upon thy Ships, thy Havens, and thy Ports,
Upon thy Arms, thy Armies, and thy Forts,
Upon thy pleasures and commodities,
Thy Crafts mechanic, and thy Merchandise;
On all the fruits, and cattle in thy fields,
On what the Air, or what the Water yields,
On Prince, and People; on both weak, and strong*
On Priest, and Prophet; on both old, and young;
Yea, on ea^h person, place, and every thing,
The plague it has deserved God shall bring.
What ever thou do hope, he frustrate shall;
And, make what e're thou fear, on thee fall.
This pleasant soil, wherein such plenty grows,
And where both milk and honey overflowes,
Shall for thy peoples wickedness be made
A Land as barren, as what never had
Such plenties in it. God shall drive away
Thy pleasant Fowls, and all those Fish that play
Within thy waters; and for whose great store
Some other Nations would have praised him more.
Those Rivers, that have made thy Valleys rich,
Shall be like sh^ames of ever-bu^ning Pitch.
Thy dust, ^s Br^mstone; fields as hard and dry
As i^on is; the Fi^mament, on high,
(^^ke b^ass^) shall yield thee neither rain nor dew,
The ^ope of wasted blessings to renew.
A leann^ss^, shall thy fatness quite devour;
Thy Wheat shall in the place of wholesome flower,
Yield naught but bran. In stead of grass and corn,
Thou shall in times of harvest, reap the thorn,
The thistle, and the b^yar. Of their shadows
Thy Gr^ves shall robbed be. Thy flowery Medowe^
Shall sterile wax. There shall be seldom seen
Sheep on thy Downs; or Shepherds on the green.
Thy walks, thy gardens, and each pleasant plot,
Shall be as those where men inhabit not.
Thy Villages, where goodly dwellings are,
Shall stand as if they unfr^quented were.
Thy C^ies, and thy Palaces, wherein
Most neatness and magnificence has bin,
Shall heaps of rubbish be; and (as in those
Demolisht Abbeys, wherein Dawes, and Crows,
Now make their nests) the bramble, and the nettle,
Shall in their halls, and parlou^s, root, and set^le.
Thy Princes houses, and thy wealthy Ports,
Now filled with men of all degrees and sorts,
Shall no inhabitants in them retain,
But some p^ore Fisherman, or country Swain,
Who of thy glories, when the marks they see,
Shall wonder wha^ those mighty ruins be;
As now they do, who old foundations find,
Of Towns and Cities, perished out o^ mind.
The places where much people meetings had,
shall vermin holes, and dens for beasts be made.
Or wal^s for Sprights, who from those uncouth room^
Shall fright the passenger, which that way comes.
In stead of mirth and l^ughter, lamentation
Shall there abide: and, loathsome desolation,
In stead of company. Where once was heard
Sweet melody, men shall be made afeard
With hideous cries, and howlings of despair.
Thy very Climate, and thy temperate air,
Shall lose their wholsomnesse, for thy offenses;
And breed hot Fevers, Murraines, Pestilences,
And all diseases. They that now are trained
In ease, and with soft pleasures entertained;
In stead o^ idle games, and wanton dances,
Shall practice how to handle guns, and lances:
And be compelled to leave their friends embraces,
To end their lives in diverse uncouth places;
Or else, thy face, with their own blood defile*
In hope to keep themselves, and thee, from spoil.
Thy beauteous Women (whose great pride is more
Then theirs, whom Esaias blamed heretofore)
In stead of paintings, and of costly sents,
Of glittering gems, and precious ornaments,
Shall wear deformity about their faces;
And, being robbed of all their tempting graces,
Feel wants, diseases, and all such like things,
Which to a wanton Lover lothing brings.
Thy God, shall for thy overflowing vices,
Scourge thee with Scorpions, Serpents, Cockatrices,
And other such; whose tails with stings are armed,
That neither can be plucked forth, nor charmed.
Thou shall not be suffiz'd when thou art fed;
Nor shall thou suffer scarcity of bread
And temp'rall food alone; but, of that meat,
Whereof the faithful soul desires to eat.
That curse of ravenous beasts, which God has said,
Upon a wicked kingdom shall be la^d,
He will inflict on thee. For, though there be
No Tigers Lions, Wolves, or Bears in thee,
By beastly minded men (that shall be far
More c^uell then those bloody spoilers are)
Thou shall be torn: For, each man shall assay
His fellow to devour as lawful prey.
In stead of Lions, Tyrants thou shall breed,
Who nor of Conscience, nor of Law take heed;
But, on the weak man's portion lay their paw,
And, make their Ple^sures, to become their Law.
In stead of Tigers, men of no compassion,
A furious, and a wilful generation,
Shall fill thy borders. Thieves, and outlawes vile,
Shall hunt the ways, and haunt the woods for spoil*
As Bears, and Wolves. A subtle cheating crew
(That will with tricks and cousnages pursue
The simpler sort) shall here increase their breed*
And, in their subtleties the Fox exceed.
That hoggish herd, which always rooting are
Within the ground, and never upward rear
Their grunting snouts; nor fix their eyes on heaven*
To look from whence their daily food is given:
Those filthy swinish livers, who desire
To feed on draffe, and wallow in the mire;
Those, who affect rank pudles, more then springs;
To trample and despise most precious things;
The holy to profane; Gods herbs of grace
To nouzle up; his Vineyard to deface;
And such like harms to do: these spoil thy fields,
Mar worse, then those wild Bores the desert yields.
If thou remain impenitent, thou art
Like Egypt; and, so stony is thy heart.
For which obdurateness, those plagves will all
Descend on th^e, which did on Egypt fall
Blood, Frog^, and Lice, great swarms of uncou^h Flies,
The Infectious M^rraine, whereof Cat^le dies;
Boiles, Scab^, and Bl^ine; fierce H^il, and Thunder-storm^;
The ^ocust, and all fruit devouring Worms.
Gross Darkness, and the Death or those that be
Thy Darlings; all those Plagues shall fall on thee,
According as the Letter does imply,
Or, as in mystic sense they signify.
Thy purest Rivers God shall ^u^ne to blood;
With every Lake, that has been swe^t and good.
Even in thy nostrils he shall make it stink*
For, nothing shall thy people eat or drink*
Until their own, or others blood it cost;
Or, put their lives in hazard to be lost.
Most loathsome Frogs; that is, a race impure*
Of base condition, and of birth obscure.
(Even in unwholesome fens, and ditches, bred)
Shall with a clownish rudeness overspread
Thy pleasant'st fields; thy fairest rooms possess;
And make unwholesome (by their sluttishnesse)
Thy kneading troughs, thy ovens, and that meat,
Whereof thy people, and thy Princes eat.
This hateful brood, shall climb to croak and sing,
Within the lodging chambers of the King.
Yea, there make practice of those natural notes,
Which issue from their evill-sounding throats:
To wit, vain brags, revilings, ribaldries,
Vile slanders, and unchristian blasphemies.
The Land shall breed a nasty Generation,
Unworthy either of the reputation
Or name of men. For, they as Lice shall feed
Even on the body whence they did proceed;
Till poverty, and sloven^y, and sloth,
Have quite disgraced them, and consumed them, both*
There shall, moreover, swarms of diverse Flies,
Engendered be in thy prosperities,
To be a plague: the Flesh fly shall corrupt
Thy savory meats; Musketoes inte^rupt
The weary traveller; thou shall have Drones,
Dor^s, Hornets, Wasps, and such l^ke angry-ones,
Who represent that sw^rme whose buzzing tongues
(Like stings) are used in their neighbors wrongs*
And, still are flying, and still humm^ng so,
As if they meant some weighty works to do,
When as, upon the common stock they spend;
And naught perform of that which they p^etend.
Thy Butter-flies shall plague thee too; even those,
Who waste their Lands and Rents, in gaudy clothe^,
Or idle flutterings; and then spawne their seed,
Upon thy goodly'st flowers, and he^bs to feed.
As Beasts destroyed by the Murraine be,
So, they that are of beastly life in thee,
By lewd example shall infect each other;
And in their foul diseases ^ot together.
On all thy people, of what so^t soever,
Shall scabs, and biles, and running sores appear,
The fruits of their corruption. Yea, wi^h pains
(Within their conscience, and with scars and blaines
Of outward infamy) ^hey shall be grieved;
And, in their to^tures perish, unreli^ved.
Tempestuous storms, upon this I Will shall fall,
Hot Thunderbolts, and Haile-stones therewi^hall;
Men* either too too ho^, or too too cold;
Or else lukewarm. But, few or none shall hold
A rightful temper: and, these meteors will
Thy borders with a thousand mischieves fill.
The Locust also and the Palmer wro^es,
Shall prey on what escapes from the Storms:
Not they alone, which on the grass^ do breed;
Bu^, also, they who from the ^it proceed
Which has no bottom: and, when any thing
Does by the dew of heaven begin to spring,
They shall devour the same, till they have left thee,
Nor leaf nor blossom; but, of all bereft thee.
Then, shall a darkness follow, far more black,
Then when the light corporeal thou do lack.
For, grossest Ignorance, o'reshadowing all,
Shall in so thick a darkness thee inthrall,
That, thou a blockish people shall be made,
S^ill wandering o^ in a d^ceiving shade;
Mistrusting those that saf^st paths are showing;
Most trusting them, who counsel thy undoing;
And aye ^ormented be with doub^s and fears,
As one that o^tcries, in dark places hears.
Nor shall the hand of God from thee return,
Till he has also smo^e thine eldest-b^rne.
That is, till he has taken from thee qu^te,
Even that whereon thou se^^t thy whole delight;
And filled every house throughout this Nation,
With deaths unlooked for, and lamentation.
So great shall be thy ruin, and thy shame,
That when the neighboring kingdoms hear the same
Their ears shall tin^le. And when that day comes,
In which thy follies must re^eive their doom^s;
A day of clouds, a day of gloomin^sse,
A day of black despair, and heaviness,
It will appear. And, then thy vanitie^,
Thy gold, thy silver, thy confederacies,
And all those reeds on which thou have depended;
Will fail thy trust, and leave thee unbefriended.
Thy King, thy Priest, and Prophets, then shall mourn;
And, peradventure, f^inedly ^e^u^ne
To beg of God to succou^ them: but, they
Who will not ha^k^ ^ ^his voice to day,
Shall c^y unh^ede^: and he will despise
Their v^wes, their prayers, and their sacrifice:
A sea of troubles, all thy hopes shall swallow:
As waves o^^ wav^s, so plague on plague shall follow:
And, ev'^y thing that was a blessing to thee,
Shall turn to be a curse, and help undo thee.
Thy Sov'raignes have to th^e thy Fathers bin;
By means of them has peace been^ k^pt within
Thy sea-gi^t limits: they, thy weal befriended,
The blessed Faith they stoutly h^ve defended:
And, thou have cause of goodly hopes in him,
Who has, of late, put on thy Diadem.
But know, that (till thou shall repent) no part
Belongs to thee of what is his desert.
His princely virtues, to his own avail,
Shall profit much: but, they to thee shall fail.
To thee his clemency shall seem severe,
His favors all, shall injuries appear;
And when thy sin is fully ^ipe in thee,
Thy Prince and People, then, alike shall be.
Thou shall have Babes to be thy Kings; or worse*
Those Tyrants who by cruelty and force
Shall take away thy ancient freedoms quite,
From all their Subjects; yea* themselves deligh^
In their vexations: and, all those that are
Made slaves thereby, shall murmur, yet not dare
To stir against them. By degrees, they shall
Deprive thee of thy patrimonies all;
Compel thee (as in other Lands, this day)
For thin^ own meat, and thine own drink to pay.
And, at the last, begin to exercise
Upon thy sons, all heathnish tyrannies,
As just Prerogatives. To these intents,
Thy Nobles shall become their instruments.
For, they who had their bi^th from noble races,
Shall (some and some) be brought into disgraces:
From offices they shall excluded stand:
And all their virtuous offspring, from the Land,
Shall quite be worn: in stead of whom shall rise
A brood advanced by impieties,
By flattery, by purchase, and by that
Which every truly-noble one does hate.
From stems obscure, and out of mean professions*
They shall ascend and mount by their ambitions,
To seats of Justice; and those Names to bear,
Which honored most within these Kingdoms are*
And being thither got, shall make more strong
Their new-built Greatness, by increasing wrong:
To those, will some of these themselves unite,
Who by their births to Lordly Styles have right;
But, viciously confuming their estate,
Did from their fathers worths degenerate.
By this Confederacy, their nobler bloods
Shall countenance the others ill got goods;
The others wealth again, shall keep from scorn
Their beggary, who have been nobly borne:
And, both together, being else unable,
(In their ill course to make their standing stable)
Shall seek how they more great, and strong, may grow
By compassing the public overthrow.
They shall abuse thy Kings, with tales, and lies;
With seeming love, and servile flatteries.
They shall persuade them they have power to make
Their Wills, their Law* and as they please to take
Their peoples goods, their children, and their lives,
Even by their just and due Prerogatives.
When thus much they have made them to believe,
Then, they shall teach them practices to grieve
Their subjects by; and, instruments become
To help the screwing up, by some and some,
Of Monarchies ^o Tyrannies. They shall
Abuse Religion, Honesty, and all,
To compass their designs. They shall devise
Strange projects; and with impudence, and lies,
Proceed in settling them. They shall forget
Those reverent usages, which do befit
The majesty of State; and rail, and storm,
When they pretend disorders to reform.
In their high Counsels, and where men should have
Kind admonitions, and reprovings grave,
When they offend; they shall be threatened there,
Or scoft, or taunted, though no cause appear.
It is unseemly for a Judge to sit
And exercise a jibing Schoole-boyes wit
Upon their trades, or names, who stand before
Their judgment se^ts: but, who does not abhor
To hear it, when a Magistrate objects,
Birth, poverty, or personal defects
In an upbraiding wise? Or, who with me
Derides it not, when in out Courts we see
Those men, whose bodies are both old and weak,
(Forgetting gr^ve and useful things to speak)
Vent Giant^ words* and bristle up, as tho
Their very breath could armies overthrow*
Whereas (poor we^klings) were there in their place^
No more authority, then in their faces,
Their persons, or their language, all their chasing*
And threatening, nothi^^ would effect but laughing.
For, unto me big looks, and crying hoh,
As dreadful seems, as when a child cries boh
To fright his Nurse: yea, such a bug bear fashion
Effects naught but scornful indignation.
But in those times (which neare^ are then some
Suppose perhaps) such Rhetoric will come
To be in use; and arguments of Reason,
And just proceedings, will be out of season.
Their wisdom shall be folly; and, go nigh
To bring contempt on their Authority.
Their Counsell-Table shall a snare be made,
And those against whom they no just matter had*
At first appearance, shall be urged to say
Some word or other, e're they part away,
Which will betray their innocence to blame,
And bring upon them detriment and shame:
Yea, many times (as David has of old,
Concerning such oppressors, well foretold)
To humble crouchings, and to fained shows,
Descend they shall, to work men's ove^throwes*
And, what their subtlety does fail to gain*
They shall by rigor, and by force obtain.
What ever from thy people they can tear,
Or borrow, they shall keep, as if it were
A prize which had been taken from the Foe:
And, they shall make no conscience what they do
To prejud^ce Posterity. For, they
To gain their lust, but for the present day,
Shall with such love unto themselves endeavor,
That (though they knew it would undo for ever
Their own posterity) it shall not make
Those Mo^^ters any better course to take.
Nay, God shall give them up for their offenses,
To such uncom^ly reprobated senses:
And, blind them so, that (when the a^e they see
Even hewing at the root of their own tree,
By their own handy strokes) they shall not griev^
For their approaching fall: no, nor believe
Their fall approaches; nor assume that heed
Which might prevent it, till they fall indeed.
Thy Princes, Britain, in those days, will b^
Like roaring Lions, making prey of thee.
God shall deliv^r thee into their hand,
And they shall act their pleasure in the Land*
As once his Prophet threatened to that Nation*
Which does exemplify thy Desolation.
Thy Kings (as thou have wallowed in excess)
Shall take delight in drink, and wantonness.
And, those whom thou do call thy Noble-o^es
Shall to the very marrow, gnaw thy bones.
Thy Lawyers wilfully shall wrest thy Laws*
And (to the ruin of the common Cause)
Shall mis-interpret them, in hop^ of grace
From those, who may dispoile them of their place*
Yea, that whereto they are obliged, both
By Conscience, by their Calling, and their Oat^
To put in execution; they shall fear,
And, leave them helpless, who oppressed are.
Thy Prelates in the spoil of thee shall share;
Thy Priests, as light shall be, as those that are
The meanest persons. All their Prophecies*
Or preachings, shall be heresies and lies.
The word of truth in them shall not remain,
Their lips no wholesome knowledge shall retain*
And all his outward means of saving Grace,
Thy God shall carry to another place.
Mark well oh Britain! what I now shall say,
And do not slightly pass these words away;
But, be assured that when God begins,
To bring that vengeance on thee, for thy sins,
Which hazard will thy total overthrow,
Thy Prophets, and thy Priests shall sliely sow
The seeds of that dissension, and sedition,
Which Time will ^ipen for thy sad perdition.
Even they, who forme^ly, were of thy peace
The happy instruments, shall then increase
Thy troubles most. And* ^v'n as when the Jews
Gods truth-presaging Prophets did abuse,
He suffered those who preached in hi^ Name,
Such falsehoods as the chiefest cause became
Of their destruction: so if thou go on
To make a scorn (as thou have often done)
Of them who seek thy well are, he will send
False prophets, that shall bring thee to thine end,
By saying all things thou would have them say:
And lulling thee asleep in thine own way.
If any brainsick Fellow, whom the Devil
Seduceth to inflict on thee some evil,
Shall coin false Doctrines, or persuade thee to
Some foolish course that will, at length, undo
The Commonweal: his counsel thou shall follow;
Then, covered with his bait, a hook shall swallow
To rend thine entrails: and thine ignorance
Shall, also for that mischief, him advance.
But if that any lover of thy weal,
Inspired with truth, and with an honest zeal,
Shall tell thee ought pertaining to thy good,
His Messag^s shall stiffly be withstood:
That Seer shall be charged not to see;
His word shall slighted as a po^sherd be;
His life shall ^e traduced, to disgrace
His Counsell^; or, his errant to debase:
In stead of recompense, he shall be sure,
Imprisonments, or threatenings to procure*
And, peradventure (as those Prophets were,
Who did among the Iew^sh Peers declare
Their States en^r^ities) h^s good intention
May be so wrong^d, that he, by some invention,
May lose his li^e, wit^ publ^ke shame and hate,
As one that i^ a trouble^ o^ ^he State.
But, not unl^sse ^he ^riest thereto consent:
For in those ^aye^ shall ^^w men innocent
Be g^iev'd (t^r^^^h any qu^^ter of the Land)
In which thy C^e^g^e shall not have some hand.
If ever in thy (...), (as God ^orbid)
The blood of t^in^ own children shall be shed
By civil discord, they shall blow the flame,
That will become thy ruin, and thy shame.
And thus it shall be kindled. When the times,
Are nigh at worst* and thy increasing crimes
Almost complete; the Devil shall begin
To bring strange crotchets, and opinions in
Among thy Teachers; which will breed disunion*
And interrupt the visible communion
Of thy established Church And, in the steed
Of zealous Pastors, (who Gods flock did feed)
There shall arise within thee, by degrees,
A Clergy, that shall more desire to fleece,
Then feed the flock. A Clergy it shall be,
Divided in it self: and they shall thee
Divide among them, into several factions,
Which rend thee will, and fill thee with distractions*
They all in outward seeming shall pretend
Gods glory, and to have one pious end:
But, under color of sincere devotion,
Their study shall be temporal promotion*
Which will among themselves strange quarrels make
Wherein thy other Children shall partake.
As to the Persons, or the Cause, they stand
Affected, even quite throughout the Land.
One part of these will for preferment strive,
By lifting up the King's prerogative
Above it self. They shall persuade him to
Much more then Law or Conscience bids him do*
And say, God warrants it. His holy Laws
They shall pervert, to justify their cause;
And, impudently wrest, to prove their ends,
What God, to better purposes, intends.
They shall not blush to say, that every King*
May do like Solomon, in every thing,
As if they had his warrant: and shall dare
Ascrib^ to Monarchs, rights that proper are
To none but Christ; and mix their flatteries,
With no less gross and wicked blasphemies,
Then Heathens did: yea, make their Kings believe,
That whomsoever they oppress or grieve,
It is no wrong; nor fit for men oppressed,
To seek by their own Laws to be red^essed.
Such counsel shall thy Princes then provoke,
To cast upon thee Rehoboams yoke.
And, they not caring, or not taking heed
How ill that ill-advised King did speed,
Shall m^ltiply thy causes of distraction.
For, then, will of thy Priests, the other faction
Bestir themselves. They will in outward shows,
Those whom I last have mentioned, oppose.
But, in thy ruin* they will both agree,
As in one Center, though far often they b^
In their Diameter. With lowly zeal,
An envious* pride they s^ily shall conceal*
And, as the former to thy Kings will teach
Mere Tyranny: so shall these other preach
Rebellion to the People* and shall strain
The word of God, Sedition to maintain.
They shall not fear to say, that if thy King
Become a Tyrant, thou may also fling
Obedience off; or from his Crown divorce him*
Or, by the ter^or of drawn swords enforce him.
Which false Divinity, shall to the Devil
Send many souls and bring on thee much evil.
Oh! be thou therefore watchful; and when e're
These Lambs with Dragons voices do appea^e,
Repent thy sin, or t^ke it for a token,
That some great Bulwark^ of thy peace is broken,
Which must be ^oone repaired or else, all
The greatness o^ thy glory, down will fall.
Take heed of those false prop^ets, w^o will strive
Betwixt thy Prince and People to cont^ive
A disagreement. And, what ever come,
Thy due Allegiance never sta^t thou from.
For (their oppressions though we may withstand
By pleading Laws, or Customs) not a hand
Must move against them, save the hand of God*
Who makes a King, a Bulwark, or a Rod,
As pleases him. Oh! take ye therefore heed
Ye People, and ye Kings (that shall succeed)
Of these Impostors. Of the last beware
Ye Subjects: for, their Doctrines hellish are.
And though they promise Liberty and peace,
Your Thraldom, and your Troubles they will increase.
Shun oh! ye Kings the first; for, they advise
What will your Crowns and honors prejudice.
When you do think their Prophecies befriend you,
They do but unto Ramoth-Gilead send you,
Where you shall perish; and poor Micahs word,
Though less esteemed more safety will afford*
They will abuse your piety, and all
Your virtues. To their wicked ends they shall
Apply the Sacred Story; or what ever
May seem to further their unjust endevor.
Even what the son of Hann^h told the Jews,
Should be their scourge (because they did refuse
The sov'raignty of God, and were so vain
To ask a King which over them might reign
A^ heathen Princes did) that curse they shall
Affirm to be a Law Monarchiall
Which God himself established to stand
Throu^hout all ages, and in every land.
Which is as good Divinity, as they
Have also taught, who do not blush to say
That Kings may have both Wives and Concubines;
And, by that Rule whereby these great Divines
Shall prove their Tene^, I dare undertake
(If ^ound it hold) that I like proof will m^k^
Of any Jewish Custom, and devise
Authority for all absurdities.
But, false it is. For, might all Kings ^t pleasure
(As by the right of royalty) make ceasure
Of any man's possessions: why I pray
Did Ahab grieve, that Naboth said him nay?
Why made ^e not this answer thereunto,
(If what the Proph^t said some Kings would do,
We^e justly to ^e done) Thy Vineyard's mine;
And, at my pleasure, Naboth, all that is thine
Assume I may. Why, like a Turky-chick,
Did he so foolishly ^row sullen sick,
And get possession by a wicked fact
Of what might have been his by royal act?
Thus God is pleased, to humble and to raise:
Thus, he by several names, and several ways,
The world does govern. Yea, thus, even in one nation,
And in one State, he makes much alteration
In forms of Government; often changing that
Which is but acc^dentall to a State.
And, such his Justice, and his Wisdom is,
That he preserves by the means of this,
Those things which do essentially pertain
To that great Power, which over all does reign.
Nor is he pleased thu^ it should be done
In States that merely civil are alone*
But, also, in the Churches governments,
Allows the change of outward accidents.
Yea, they to whom he gives the oversights
Of some particular Church, may change old Rites,
The Customs, Forms, or Titles, as occasions
Are off^ed them; or, as the Times, or Nations,
Require a change: provided so, that they
Take nothing which essential is, away;
Nor add what shall repugne or prejudice
Gods Laws, his Kin^dome, or the Liberties
Of them that ar^ his people. For, in what
Has any Church a power, if not in tha^
Which is indifferent? Or, in what I pray
Will men the Church authority obey,
If not in such like things? O^, who should be
The Judge what is indifferent, if not she?
A private Spirit knows what bent agrees
With his own fancy; but the Church best se^
What fit^ the Congregation. From what gives
Offense to one* another man receives
Much comfort: and, his conscienc^ edifies,
By disciplines, which many do despise*
A Parish is a little Diocese;
And, as of Cities, Towns, and Villages,
A B^shoprick consists: so, that does rise
By ^ythings, Hamlets, and by Families.
And little diffrence would be in the same,
(Excepting in the la^genesse and the name)
I^ their opinions were allowed of all,
Who savor not the style Epis^opall:
For, every Priest would then usurp the same
Aut^ority, wher^of o^ some hate the name.
Yea, many a one would then his Parish make
A little Popedom, and upon him take
(Con^ide^ing his mean^ power) as much as h^
That V^ive^s^ll Bishop claims to be:
And, prove more p^oud, and troublesome, then they
Against whose Lordlinesse they now inveigh.
This therefore is my Rule; that Government
(What e're it be) in which to me God ^ent
My birth and breeding; that, until my end,
I will obey, and to my power d^fend.
Yea, though it tyrannize, I will denay
No more obedience, then by Law I may:
Even by those Laws and Customs which do stand
In force, and unrepealed in that Land.
What right another had, e're I was borne,
Or how, or for what sin, Gods hand has torn
His Kingdom from him, I will never care;
Let them go answer that who Subjects were,
(When lost it was) and had that means, and calling,
And years, which might prevented have his falling.
Or should another Country take me home
As one of hers; when thither I did come
I would nor seek, nor wish to innovate
The Titles, or the Custome^ of that State,
To what some other Countries better thought:
But, leave such things to those to whom I ought.
And, there, if any Faction shall constrain
That I one part must take, I will maintain
What bore the Sov'raignty when I came thither;
And, I and that will stand and fall together.
The same obedience, also, keep I shall.
To governments Ecclesiastical
Where e're I come; if nothing they command
Which does Gods word, ess^ntially, withstand:
Or, indirectly, or directly, thwart
His glory, or the purity pervert
Of Ch^istian Principles; nor further strife,
Nor c^use, nor countenance an evil life.
The Hye^archy, here, I will obey,
And reverence, while I in England stay.
In Sco^land if I lived, I would deny
No due respect to their Presbytery.
G^neva should I visit, I would there
(...) my self to what their customs were.
Yea, wheresoe'^e I am, I will suppose
The Spirit in that Church much better known
What best that place befitteth, then I do:
And, I will live conformed thereunto,
In every thing that is me^rly politic,
And injures not the Doctrines Catholic.
To every temp'rall power I Will be the same,
By whatsoever cognizance, or name,
M^n please to call it. If I should be sent
To Poland, where a mixed government
Established is; I would not t^ll them, there,
That any other Custom better were.
Were I in Switzerland, I would maintain
^^mocrity; and, think to make it plain,
That for these Times, those Can^ons, and that Nation.
There could not be a better Domination.
In Venice, far before a Monarchy
I would p^efer an Aristocratie.
In Spai^e, and France, and in Great Britain here,
I hold no Governments more perfect are
Then Monarchies. And, if Gods will should be,
Bene^th a Tyrant to envassaile me,
I would p^rswade my self, that heavy yoke
Were best, for some respects; and, to the stroke
Even of an i^on Mace would subject be,
In body* with a mind that should be free
From his inforcement, (^f he did withstand,
Or bid me what Gods Law does countermand.)
There is, I know, a middle-way that lies
Even just betwixt the two extremities,
Which to sedition, and to faction tend.
To find which tract, my whole desire I bend;
And wish it followed more. For, if we tread
That harm^^sse path, we cannot be misled;
Nor shamed, though blamed we be. To every man
I feign wou^d give his due; and all I can
I do endeavor it. I would not wrong
My Country; neither take what does belong
To Caesar: nor infringe, or prejudice,
The Universal Churches liberties;
Nor for her outward Discipline prefer
Or censure, any Church particular;
Or any State, but as befit it may,
His Muse, which naught but needful truths does say.
Nor have I any purpose to withdraw
Obedience, or respect from any Law
That Is positive; or, to dishearten from
Those Customs, which a Christian state become.
If such Divinity, as this were true,
The Queen^ should not have needed to pursue
Poor Naboth, as she did; or, so contrive
His death; since by the Kings Prerogative,
She might have got his Vineyard. Nor would God
Have scourged that murder with so keen a rod,
O^ Ahab, had he asked but his due.
For, he did neither plot, nor yet pursue
The murder; nor (for ought that we can tell)
Had knowledge of the deed of Iezabel.
Till God revealed it by the Prophet to him.
Nor is it said, that Naboth wrong did do him,
Or disrespect; in that he did not yield,
^o sell, or give, or to exchange his Field.
The Jewish Commonwealth did so instate,
That, their possessions none could alienate,
But for a time; who ever, for his money,
Or in exchange, desired their patrimony.
And* doubtless, we offend, who at this day
Those Freedoms give, or lose, or sell away,
Which were in common right possessed of old,
By our Forefathers; and, continue should
To all their after-commers. For, although
We may dispose of what pertaines unto
Our persons: yet, those dues which former ages
Have left unto us for our heritages,
(And whereunto, the child that borne must be,
Has every whit as good a right as we)
Those dues we should preserve with all our might,
By pleading of our just and ancient right,
In humble wise; if so the Sov'raigne state
Our Freedoms shall attempt to violate.
But, when by peaceful means we cannot save it,
We to the pleasure of the King must leave it,
And unto God our Judge: For all the power
In us, consists in saying, This is our.
A King is for a blessing, or a ^urfe:
And therefore though a F^ole he were, or worse,
A Tyrant, or ^n Ethnic) no man may
So much as in their p^ivate clossets, pray
Against his person; though they may petition
Against the wickedness of his condition.
Nor, is this ^uffrance due to those alone,
Who ^^bject are unto a Monarchs throne,
But, from all those who either subjects are
To mixed Governments, or popular.
For, though irregularities appear
In every State; because but men they are
Whom God exalts to ^ule: yet, it is he
By whom all Governments ordained be.
And every Government (although the Name
Be different) is in effect the same.
In Monarchies, the Counsel (as it were
An Aristocracy) one while does bear
The sway of all* and though they name the King*
Yet, him they overruled in ev'^y thing.
Sometime a^^ine, the pop^lar voice we see,
Does awe the Counsel, when in them there be
Some pop'lar Spirits. Aristocracies
Are otherwhile the same with Monarchies.
For, one great man among them gets the power,
From all the rest, and like an Emperor,
Does act his pleasure. And we know it is common.
To have some foolish Favorite, or Woman,
To govern him. So, in a pop'lar State,
Affairs are managed by the self same fate;
And, either one or more, away do steal
The peoples hearts, and sway the Commonweal.
Thus God is pleased, to humble and to raise:
Thus, he by several names, and several ways,
The world does govern. Yea, thus* even in one nation,
And in one State, he makes much alteration
In forms of Governmen^; often changing that
Which is but accedentall to a State.
And, such his Justice, and his Wisdom is,
That he preserves by the means of this,
Those things which do essentially pertain
To that great Power, which over all does reign.
Nor is he pleased thus it should be done
In States that merely civil are alone;
But, also, in the Churches governments,
Allows the change of outward accident^.
Yea, they to whom he gives the oversights
Of some particular Church, may change old Rites,
The Customs, Forms, or Titles, as occasions
Are offered them; or, as the Times or Nations,
Require a change: provided so, that they
Take nothing which essential is, away;
Nor add what shall repugne or prejudice
Gods Laws, his Kin^dome, or the Liberties
Of them that are his people. For, in what
Has any Church a power, if not in that
Which is indifferent? Or, in what I pray
Will men the Church authority obey,
If not in such like things? O^, who should be
The Iudg^ what is indifferent, if not she?
A private Spirit knows what be^^ agrees
With his own fancy; but the Church best se^
What fit^ the Congregation. From what gives
Offense to one; another man receives
Much comfort: and, his conscience edifies,
By disciplines, which many do despise*
Nor h^ve I any thought to scandalize,
Or speak amiss of Principalities;
Or, to traduce men's persons: but, I fall
On errors of men's lives in general,
And, on those great Abuses, which I see
To blemish every Calling and Degree.
Of Dignitie^ and Persons, I observe
All me^nes I can, their honors to preserv^,
When I reprove their faults. And, even as he
That hunteth Foxes, where Lambs feeding be,
May fright that harmless flock, and suffer blame
Of some Bystanders, (knowing not his Game)
When from his Dog^, those Innocents are free,
And none but their devoure^s bitten be.
So, though my reprehensions, often are
Mistook by foolish Readers; they are far
From repr^hending those, or taxing that
Which is unfitting for my shooting at.
I speak those things which will advantage rather
Then harm: and hence this blinded age may gath^r
Much light. This little Volume does relate
Naught else but what is like to be our Fate;
If sin increase; and what in former times
Did fall on other Nations for their crimes,
I utter what our welfare may increase,
And help confirm us in a happy peace;
Which they will never compass, who p^^sue
To speak what is pleasing, rather then what is true.
How ever, here my thoughts deliv'red be:
Let God as he shall please, deliver me.
And if what here is mentioned, thou do he^^
(Oh Britain!) in those times that shall succeed,
It may prevent much loss, and make thee shun
Those mischiefs, whereby Kingdoms are undone.
But, to thy other sins, if thou shall add
Rebellions (as false Prophets will persuade)
Which likely are to follow, when thou shall
In thy profession of Religion halt:
Then, will thy Kings and People scourge each other,
For their offenses, till both fall together:
By weakening of your powers, to make them way,
Who seek and look for that unhappy day.
Then, shall disorder every where abound,
And neither just nor pious man be found.
The best shall be a Bryer or a Thorn,
By whom their neighbors shall be scratcht and to^^e.
Thy Princes shall to nothing condescend
For any merit just, or pious end;
But either for increasing of their treasure,
Or for accomplishing their wilful pleasure:
And un^o what they ^ell or daigne for meed,
There shall be given little trust or heed.
For, that which by their words confirm they shall,
(The royal Seals uniting therewithal)
A toy shall frustr^te; and a gift shall make
Their strictest O^ders no effect to take.
The Judge, without a bribe, no Cause shall end:
No man shall trust his bro^her, or his friend:
The parents and the children shall despi^e
And hate, and spoil each other: she that lies
Within her husbands bosom, shall betray him:
They who thy people should protect, shall stay them:
The aged shall reg^r^ed be of none:
The poor shall by the rich be trodden on:
Such grievo^s inf^olencies, everywhere
Shall acted be; that good and bad shall fear
In thee to dwell; and, men discreet shall h^te
To be a Ruler, or a Magistrate;
When they behold (without impenitence)
So much injustice, and such violence.
And, when thy wickedness this height shall gain,
To which (no doubt) it will e're long attain*
If thou proceed: Then, from the bow that is bent
(And half way dr^wne already) shall be ^ent
A mortal arrow; and it pierce thee shall
Quite through the head, the liver, and the gall.
The Lord shall call, and whistle from af^rre,
For those thy enemies that fiercest are:
For those thou fear most; and they shall from
Their Coun^ries, like a whi^le wind hither come.
They shall nor sleep, nor stumble, nor untie
Their garments, till within thy fields they lie.
Sharp shall their arrows be, and strong their bow.
Their faces shall as full of horror show
As does a Lions. Like a bolt of thunder,
Their troops of horse shall come, and tread thee under
Their iron feet. Thy foes shall eat thy bread,
And with thy flocks both clothed be, and fed.
Thy Dwellers, they shall carry from their own,
To Countries which their fathers have not known^*
And, thither shall such mischiefs them pursue,
That they who seek the pit-fall to eschew,
Shall in a snare be taken. If they shall
Escape the sword, a Serpent in the wall
To death shall sting them: yea (although they hap
To shun a hundred plagues) they shall not escape;
But, with new dangers, still be cha^'d about,
Until that they are wholly rooted out.
The Plowman, then, shall be afraid to sow;
Artificers their labor shall forgo*
The Merchant man shall cross the Seas no more*
(Except to fly and seek some other shore)
Thy ablest-m^n shall faint: thy wise-ones, then,
Shall know themselves to be but foolish men.
And they who built and plant^d by oppression,
Shall leave their gettings to the foes possession.
Yea, God will scourge thee, England, ^even times more
With seven times greater Plagues then heretofore.
Then, thy Allies their friendship shall withdraw;
And, they that of thy greatness stood in awe,
Shall say (in scorn) Is this the valiant Nation,
That had throughout the world such reputation,
By victories upon the shore? Are these
That people, which were masters of the s^as,
And grew so mighty? yea that petty Nation,
That were not worthy of thy indignation,
Shall mock thee too; and all thy former fame,
Forgot shall be, or mentioned to thy shame.
Mark how Gods pl^gues were doubled on the I^ew^
When they his mild corrections did abuse:
Mark what, a^ last upon their Land h^ sent;
And, look thou for the se^e same punishment,
If them thou imitatest. I or their sin,
At first, but eight years Bondage they were in.
Their wick^dn^sse grew more; and God did then,
To Eglon, make them sl^ves, ^ight years and ten.
They dis^beying, still, the God of heaven;
Their years of Servitude were twenty seven,
To Iabin and to Midian. Then, prevailed
Philistia fo^ty yea^es; and, when that failed,
To make them of their evil ways rep^nt,
There was, among themselves, a fatal rent;
And, they often scourged each other. Still, they trod
The self same path; and, then the hand o^ God
Brought Ashu^ on them; and, did make them bear
His heavy yo^ke, until the seventie^h year.
And last of all the Rom^ne Empire came,
Which from their Country rooted out their Name.
That foolish project which they did embrace,
To keep them in possession o^ their place,
Did lose it. And, like Cain, that vagrant Nation,
Has now remained in fearful Desolation
Nigh sixteen hundred years: and, (whatsoever
Some l^tely dream) in vain, they look for he^e
A temp'rall Kingdom. For, as long ago
Their Psalmist said; No Prophet does foresh^w
This ^hraldomes end. Nor shall it end until
The Gentiles their just number do fulfill:
Which is unlike to be until that hour*
In which there shall be no more temporal power,
Or temporal K^ngdome. Therefore* gather them
(Oh Lord*) unto thy new Jerusalem,
In t^y due time. For, ye^, unto that p^ace
They have a promi^t right, by thy mere grace.
To those who shall repent, thy firm Election
Continues in this t^mpo^all rejection.
Oh! show thy mercy in their desol^^ion,
That thou may honored be in their salvation.
Yea, teach us also, by their fearful fall,
To hea^ken to thy voice, when thou do^t ca^l;
(Lest thou in anger, unto us protest,
That we ^h^ll never come into thy rest)
For, we ^ave followed them in all their sin:
Su^^, and so m^^y, have our warnings bin:
An^* (...) thou st^^l prolong not thy compassion*
To us belongs the self same Desolation.
And it will ^ho^tly come* with all those terror^
That were on them inflicted, for their errors.
Then, woe shall be to them, th^^ hereto^ore
By joy^^^g house to hou^^, (...) the poor*
And field have into field incorporated,
Until their Tow^esh^ps were depopulated.
For, desolate their dwelling shall be made:
Even in their blood the Lord shall bathe his blade:
And they that have by avarice, and wiles,
Erected Palaces and costly Piles;
Shall think, the stones and timbers, in the wall,
Aloud, to God, for vengeance on them call.
Then, woe shall be to them who early rise
To eat, and drink, and play, and wanton^ize;
Still adding sin to sin: for, they the pain
Of cold, and thirst, and hunger, shall sustain;
And be the servile slaves of them that are
Their Foes; as to their Lusts they captives were.
Then* woe to them who d^rknesse more have loved
Then l^ght; and good advice h^ve d^s^pprov'd:
For, they shall wander in a crooked pa^^,
Which neit^er light* nor end, nor c^m^ort has
And, when for Guides, and Couns^ll they do cry,
Not one sh^^l pity them, who p^sseth by.
Then, woe to them that have corrupted ^in,
To justify the wicked in his sin;
Or, for a bribe, the righteous to condemn:
For, fl^mes (as on the chafe) shall seize on them:
Their bodies to the dun^hill shall be cast;
Their flower shall turn to dust; their flock shall wast*
And all the glorious t^^les they have wo^ne,
Shall but increase their infamy and scorn.
Then, woe to them that have been raised aloft
By good men's ruins; and by laying soft
And easy pillowes, under great men's arms,
To make them pleased in their alluring charms.
Then, woe to them, who being grown a^raid
Of some nigh peril, sought unlawful aid;
And, setting Gods protection quite aside,
Upon their own inventions have relied.
For, God their fo^lish hopes will bring to naught;
On them, their feared mischief shall be brought*
And, all their wit and strengt^, shall not suffi^e,
To heave that sorrow off, which on them lies.
Yea, then, oh Britain! woe to every one,
That has without repentance evil done:
For, those who do n^r heed, no^ bear in mind
His visitings, Gods reaching hand will find;
And they with howling cries and lamentation,
Shall sue and seek, in vain, for his compassion.
Because they car^lesse of his M^rcies were,
Till in consuming wrath he did ^ppea^e.
But, still, we set far off that evi^l day;
In dull security we pass away
Our precious time; and with v^ine hopes and toys,
Build up a trust which ^v'ry puff destroys.
And therefore, still when healing is expected,
New and unlookt for troubles are effected.
We gather Armies, and we Fleets prepare;
And, then, both strong and safe we think we are.
But, when we look for victories, and glory,
What follows, but events that make us sorry?
And it is Gods mercy that we turn our faces
With so few losses, and no more disgraces.
For, what are most of those whom we commend
Such act^ons to; and whom we forth do send
To fight those Battles, which the Lords we call,
But, such as never fight for him at all?
Whom do thou make thy Captains, and dispos^
Such Offices unto, but unto those
(Some few excepted) who procure by friends*
Command and pay, to serve their private ends?
Their language, and their practices decla^e,
That entertained by Gods Foe they were.
Their whoring, swearing, and their drunkenness,
Do far more plainly to the world express
What General they do belong unto,
Then all their Feath^rs and their Ensigns do.
These, by their unrep^nted sins, betray
Thy Cause. By these, the honor, and the day
Is lost: and when thou hopest tha^ thy trouble
Shall have an end, thy danger waxes double.
We wished for Parlia^ents; and them we made
Our God: ^or, all the hope that many had
To remedy the public discontent,
Was by the wisdom of a Parli^ment.
Well; Parliaments we had; and what in being,
Succeeds ye^, but greater disag^^eing,
With g^eater gri^va^ces then heretof^re?
And reason good: for, we depended more
On outward means, then on Gods will that sends
All punishments; and all afflictions ^nds.
Believe it should our Parliaments a^ree
In every motion: should our Sov'raigne be
So gracious, as to condescend to all
Which for his weal and ours, propose we s^all;
Even that Agr^^ment, till our sins we leave,
Shall make us but secure; and help to weave
A snare, by whose fine threads we shall be caught,
Before we see the mischie^e that is wrought.
Whilst we by Parliam^nts do chiefly se^k
Mere temp'rall ends, the King shall do the like:
Yea, till in them we mutually agree
To help each other; and unfeigned be
In laboring for a Christian Reformation;
Each Meeting shall b^get a new vexation.
This Island has some sense of what she ails,
And very much, these evil times bewayles:
But, not so much our sins do we lament,
Or mourn that God for them is discontent,
As that the Pla^ues they bring disturb our pleasures,
Increase our dangers, and ^x^aust our treasure^.
And, for these causes, now and then we ^ast,
And pray, as long as half a day does last.
For, if the Sun do but a little clear
That cloud, from which a tempest we do fear^*
What kind of g^iefe we took, we plainly show
By those rejoycings which thereon ensue:
For, in the stead of such du^ thankfu^ness^,
As Christian zeal obliges to express;
To Pleasure (not to God) we sacrifize;
Renew our sins; revive our vanities;
And, all our vowed gratitude expi^es,
In Games, in Guns, in Bells, in Healths, or Fires*
We feign would be at peace; but few men go
That way, ^s yet, whereby it may be so.
We have not that h^mility which must
Effect it: we ^re f^l^e, and cannot trust
Each other* no nor God with true confessions:
Which shows that we abhor not our transgression^*
It proves, that ^f our errors, we in heart
Repent not, neither purpose to depart
From any f^lly (...) or all they that are
Sincerely penitent* do nothing fear
So much as t^^ir own ^uil^; nor seek to gain^
Oug^t more, then to be reconc^l'd again:
And, they that ar^ ^hus minded, never can
Be long unreconcil'd to God, or man.
When we should ^^oop, we most our selves exalt;
And (though we be) would no^ be thought in fault.
Nay, though we faulty be, and thought, and known,
And proved so; and ^ce that we are th^owne
By our apparent erro^s, into straits,
From which we cannot g^t by all our sleights:
Yet, still ou^selves we vau^t and justify,
And struggle, ^ill the sn^re we faster ^ye.
We sin, and we to boast it have no shame,
Yet s^^rme when othe^s do our follies name:
And rather then we will so much as say
We did amiss (though that might wipe away
The stain of all) I think that some of us
So wil^ull are, so proud, and mischievous,
That we ours^lves would ruin, and our Nation,
To keep our shadow of a Reputation.
Oh! if we are thus headstrong, it is unlike
We any part of our proud sails will strike
Till they have sunk our Vessel in the Sea,
Or by the furious winde^, are torn away.
Twere better* tho, we did confess our wound,
Then hide it till our s^ate grew more unsound.
Twere better we some wealth, or office lost,
Then keep them, till our lives, and all, it cost:
And therefore, let us wisely be advised,
Before we by a tempest be surprised.
Down first with our Top-gallants and our Flags;
In storms* the skilfull'st Pilots make no brags.
Let us (if that be not enough) let f^ll
Our Misne-yeard, and strike our top-sailes all.
If this we find be not enough to do*
Strike Fote-saile, Sprit-saile, yea and Main-saile too.
And, rather then our Ship should sink or rend;
Let Us over board, ^oods, mast, and tackling send.
Save but the Hull, the Master, and the Men;
And we may l^ve to scour the seas again.
Believe it England, howsoever some
(Who should fo^esee thy plagues before they come)
End^vor to persuade thee that thou have
A hopeful time* and that the wo^st is past.
Yet I dare bol^ly tell thee, thou have nigh
Worn out Gods patience by impiety.
And, that unless the same we do r^nue
By penitence, our folly we shall rue.
But, what am I, that me thou should believe?
Or, unto what I tell thee, ^redit give?
It may be this adul^rous Genera^ion
Expects tokens of her desolation;
And therefore I will give them signs of that
Which they are almost now arived at.
Not signs, so mystical as most of those
Which did the ruin of the Jews ^isclose;
But, signs as evident as are ^he day.
For, know ye Britanies* that what God did say
Ierusalems destruction should foresh^w,
He spoke to every State that should ensue.
And, tha^ he naught of her, or to her sp^ke,
For hers alone, but also for our sake.
One sign that Gods long-suffring we have tired,
And that ^is patience is almost expired,
Is this; that many Judgments he has sent,
And still removed them e're we did repent.
For, God (even by his Holiness) did swear,
(Says Amos) such a Nation ^e will tear
With Brye^s, and with Fish hooks rend away
The whole posterity of such as they.
Cl^ane teeth (says God) I gave them; and with bread
In many places, them I scantly fed;
And yet they sought me not: Then I restrained
The dewes of heaven; upon this Field I rained,
And not on that; yea, to one City came
Some two or three, to quench their thirsty ^lame;
Yet, to ret^rne to me, no care they took:
With Blastings then, and Mildewes, I them struck;
And mixed among their Fruits the Palmer-worme;
Yet, they their lives did not a jot reform:
Then did I send the Pest^lence (said he)
Devoured by the Sword, their youngmen be;
Their Horse are slain, and up to heaven ascends
Their stink; yet I discover no amends.
The self same things thy God in thee has done,
Oh En^land! yet, here follows thereupon
So small amendment, that they are a sign
To thee; and their sharp Judgment, will be thine.
The second Tohen which does fore declare
When Cities, States, and Realms, declining are,
Even Christ himself has left us: For, (says he)
When Desolation shall approaching be,
Of wars, and warlike rumors ye shall hear;
Rare signs and tokens will in heaven appear;
Down from the Firmament the Stars shall fall;
The hearts of many men, then, sail them shall;
There will be many scandals and offenses;
Great Earth quakes, Schisms, Dearths, and Pestilences;
Realm, Realm; and Nation, Nation shall oppose;
The nearest friends, shall be the greates^ foes.
Against the Church shall many tyrannize;
Deceivers, and false Prophets, shall arise;
In every place shall wicked^esse abound;
And, Charity shall very cold be found.
This, Christ himself did prophecy: And we
Are doubtless blind, unless con^est it be,
That at this hour, upon this Kingdom here,
These ma^ks of Desolation viewed are.
How often have we s^ene prodig^ous lights,
O'resp^ead ^he f^ce of heaven in moonlesse nigh^s?
How many dreadful Met^ors have there been
In this ou^ Climate, lately heard and seen?
Who knows nor that but a while ago
A Blazing Star did threat, if not foreshow
Gods Judgments? In what age, tofore, did here
So many, who did Saints and Stars appear,
Fall (as it were) from heaven? Or who has heard
Of greater Earthquakes, then have lately scared
These quarters of the world? How often, the touch
Of Famine have we had? But, when so much
Devou^ed by the Pestilence were we,
As in this present year our people be?
Of Wars, and martial rumors, never more
Were heard within these confines heretofore;
When were all Kingdoms, and all Nations through
The world, so opposite as they are now?
We know no Country, whether nigh or far,
But is engaged, or threatened with some War.
All places, either present woes bewail;
Or else things feared make men's hearts to fail.
False Prophets* and Deceivers we have many;
We scarcely find integrity in any:
The Name of Christ, begins in every place
To suffer persecution and disgrace;
And, we the greatest jeopardies are in,
Among our neighbors, and our nearest kin.
Strange Heresies do ev'^ywhere increase,
Distur^ing Sion, and exiling peace.
Impiety does multiply. True love
Grows cold. And, if these tokens do not prove
Our fall draws on, unless we do amend:
I know not when our folly shall have end.
A third apparent sign which does d^clare
When some devouring Pl^gue approaches near,
Is when a Nation does anew begin
To let Idolatry to enter in;
And openly, or secre^ly give place
To Heresy, where Truth established was:
Or when like Jeroboam, to possess
An outward profit, or a temporal peace,
They either change Religions, or devise
A worship which does mix Idolatries
With truth. For this, even for this very crime,
The King of Ashur, in H^shea's time
Led Isr^el captive. And, both from the sight
Of God; and from the house of David quite,
They were c^t off for ever, and d^d neither
Serve God nor Idols; but even both together;
In such a mixed Religion as is that
Which some among us, now, have aimed at.
Mark, England; and I prithee mark it well,
If this offense which ruined Israel,
On thee appear nor: and, if so it be,
Amend; or look for what it threatens thee.
The fourth true token which does fore express
The ruin of a Land ^or wickedness,
Is when the P^iests and Magistrates begin,
To grow ext^eamly impudent in fin.
This Sign, the Prophet Micah ^iveth us;
And he (not I) to you cries loudly thus:
Hear, oh ye house of Jacob, and all ye
That Princes of the house of Is^ael be:
Ye Justice hate; and ye pervert what is good;
Ye build the wal^ of Sion up with blood;
Jerusalem with sin, ye up have reared,
Your Judges pass their censures for reward;
Your Priests do preach for hire, your Prophets do
Like them* and prop^ecy for money too.
And, for this cause shall Sion mount (says he)
Even like a plowed field become to be;
And like a Forre^t hill where b^shes grow*
The City of Jerusalem shall show.
Change but the names, oh Britain, and that token
Of desolation, unto the^ is spoken.
For, what this day thy Priests and Princes are*
Their actions, and the peoples cries declare.
A fifth sure evidence that God among
Thy ruins will en^omb thy fame e're long,
(If thou repent not) is even this, that thou
Do every day the more ungodly grow,
By how much more the blessed means of grace
Does multiply it self in every place.
God sends unto thee many learned Preachers,
Apostles, Pastors, and all kind of teachers;
His Visions, and his Prophecies upon thee
He multiplies. And (that he might have won thee
To more sincerity) on all occasions,
By counsel, by entreatie, and persuasions,
He has advised, allured, and besought thee:
With precept upon precept, he has taught thee;
By line on line; by miracle; by reason;
In every place; in season, out of season;
By little and by little; and by much
(Sometime) at once: yet is thy nature such,
That still thou waxest worse; and in the room
Of pleasant Grapes, more Thistles daily come:
And, thou that art so ^aughty, and so proud,
For this, shall vanish like an empty cloud;
And, as a Lion, Leopard, or a Bear,
Thy God, for this, shall thee in pieces tear.
If thou suppose my Muse did this devise,
Go take it from Hosea's prophesies
The sixth undoubted signal when the last
Good days of sinful Realms are almost past*
Is when the people near to God shall draw
In word, to make profession of his Law:
And, by their tongues his prai^es forth declare;
Yet, in their hearts from him continue far.
To such a Land, their de^^iny displaye^
Isaiah: for even thus the Prophet says:
God will produce a marvel in that State,
And do a work that men shall wonder at;
The wisdom of their wisest Counselor,
Shall perish, and their prudent men shall err.
On their deep Counsels, sorrow shall attend;
Their secret plots shall have a dismal end;
Their giddy projects which they have devised,
Shall as the Potters clay be quite despised.
Like Carmel, Lebanon shall seem; and he
Like Lebanon, shall make mount Carmel be.
Their pleasant Fields like Deserts shall appear;
And, there shall Gardens be, where Deserts are.
God keep (thou British I Will) this plague from thee*
For, signs thereof upon thy Body be.
Thou of the purest worship make profession;
Yet, waxest more impure in thy condition.
Thou boastest of the knowledge of Gods word,
Yet, there unto in manners to accord
Thou do refuse. Thou make protestation
Of piety; yet hate reformation.
Yea* when thy tongue does sing of praise divine,
T^y heart does plot some temporal design.
And, some of those, who in this wise are holy,
Begin to show their wisdom will be folly.
^or, when from sight their snares they deepest hide,
By God Almighties eyes they are espide.
The seventh Symptom of a dreadful blow,
(If not of a perpe^uall overthrow)
Is when a slumb^ing Spirit does surprise
A nation; and has closed up their ey^s:
Or when the Prophets and the Seers are
So cloud^d, that plain truths do not appear:
Or when the Visions evidently seen
Are passed by, as if they had not been:
Or when, to Nations who can read, God gives
His Book; and thereof does unseale the leaves,
And bids them read the same, which they to do
Deny; or ^lead unablen^sse thereto.
Black signs are th^se. For if that Book to them,
Still dark; or as a Book unsealed seem;
Or, if they heed no more what here is said,
Then they that have the Book, and cannot read;
The Judgments, last repeated, are the doom,
That shall on such a stupid Nation come.
This Sign is come on us; for, lo, unsealed
Gods Book is now among us* and revealed
Are all the Mysteries which do concern
The children of this present age to learn.
So well has he instructed this our Land,
That we not only read, but understand
The secrets of his Word. The prophecies
Of his chief Seers, are before our eyes,
Vnveiled: true interpretations
A^e made, and many proper applications
Even to our selves; yet is ou^ heart so blind,
That what we know and see, we do not mind.
We hear, and speak, and much ado we keep;
But we as sens^lesse are as men asleep
What th^n we do. Yea, wh^le that we are talking,
What sna^es are in the way where we are wal^ing,
We heed not what we say, b^t pass along;
And many times, ^re fast ^^snar'd among
Those mi^^hiefes, and those faults we did condemn,
Before our tongues have left to mention them.
For our negl^ct of God in ^ormer times,
(Or for some present unrep^nted crimes)
A slumbring Spirit ^o p^ssesseth us,
That our estate is wondrous d^ngerous.
We s^e and hear, and tell to one anoth^r
Our perils, yet we headlong have together
To wilful ruin: and are grown so mad,
That when our friends a better course persuade,
Or seek to st^p us (when they s^e we run
That way in which we cannot ruin shun)
We persecute those men with all our soul,
That we may damn our s^lves without control.
The eight plain Sign, by which I understand
That some devouring mischief is at hand,
Is that maliciousness which I do see
Among ^rsfessors of one Faith, to be.
We that have b^t one Father, and one Mother,
Do persecute, and torture one another.
So ho^ly, we oppose not Antichrist,
As we our fellow brethren do resist.
The Protestant, the Protestant defies;
And, we our selves, our selves do scandalize.
Our Church we have exposed to more scorn;
And her fai^e seamlesse Vestment rent, and torn,
By our own fury, more then by their spite
Who are to us directly opposite.
To save an Aple, we the Tree destroy;
And, quarrels make for every needless toy:
From us, if any brother differ shall
But in a crotcher, we upon him fall
As eagerly, and with as bitter hate*
As if we knew him for a Reprobate.
And, what event all this does signify,
Saint Paul (by way of caveat) does imply.
Take heed (s^ith he) lest while ye bite ^ach other,
You, o^ your selves, consumed be together.
Another S^gne which cau^eth me to fear
That our confusion is approaching near,
Are those Disunions which I have espide,
In Church and Commonwealth, this pr^sent tide.
We cannot hide th^se rents; for they do gape,
So wide, that some their Iaw^s can hardly escape.
Would God, the way to close them up we knew,
Else, what they threaten, time will shortly show:
For, all men know, a City or a Land,
Within it self d^vided, ca^n^t stand*
The last black sign that here I will repeat,
(Which does to kingdoms desolation threat)
Is when the hand of God Almighty brings
The people, into bondage, to their Kin^s.
I say, when their own King shall take delight,
Those whom he should protect, to rob, and smite.
When they who fed the Sheep* the Sheep shall kill,
And eat them; and suppose they do no ill.
When God gives up a Nation unto those
That are their neighbors, that they may, as foes,
Devour them. When (oh England!) thou shall see
This come to pa^se, a sign it is to thee
That God is angry; and a certain token
That into pieces thou shall quite be broken:
I^ not by so ra^ne strength, by force at home;
And, that thy greater torment will become.
This Vengeance, and this fearful preparation,
Of bringing ruin on a sinful N^tion,
(If they remain impenitent) the Lord
Does menace; and, by Zachary ^ecord,
To make us wise. Oh! let us therefore learn*
What now is coming on us, to discern.
For, (well considered if all things were)
From this Captivity we seem not far.
It now already seeme^ to be proj^ct^d;
Nay, little wants of being quite effected.
For, they that are our Sheph^^rds, now, are they
That fleece us, and endevor to betray
Our lives and freedoms. Those great men that be
Our nei^hbours (and can claim no more then we)
Would sell us: and, att^mpt to gain a power,
Whe^eby they may, at pleasure, us d^voure:
And, h^d not we a King, as loath to make
His people slaves, as from himself to take
His lawful right; (or, were there not some let
Vnheeded, which is unremov^d yet)
E're this (and justly too) the hand of heaven
Into perpetual bondage us had given.
And, if we do not more Gods will regard,
That mischief is but for a time deferred,
Our King is just and merciful; and the
Some may (with loyal, and a gilded s^ow
Of pious equity) a while ^ssay
To lead his judgment in his youth astray;
Yet, God (I hope) will keep him so, that he
Shall still be just, (though we ungodly be)
And, make him in the fitteft hour express
His royal Judgment, and his Right^ousnesse:
But, if God should from us (as God forbid)
Take him, as once he good Josiah did,
He also will (unless we mend) perchance,
In times to come, a Shepherd here advance,
Who shall not plead for what his Youngmen say
Is just; but, take the same, perforce, away.
An Ido^l Shep^eard, who shall neither care
To find or seek, for those that strayed are;
Nor guard the Lamb^; nor cure what has a wound;
Nor cherish those that fi^me to him are found;
But, take the fat, and rob them of their fleeces;
And eat their flesh; and b^eak their bones in pieces.
More Signs I might, as yet, commemorate,
To show Gods pa^^ence is nig^ out of date.
But, these are signs enough* an^ so apparent,
That twenty more w^ll give no better warrant
To what I speak. Yet, if these ^^lse appear,
That Is one sign more, our fall approaches near.
Be mind^ull, therefore, while it is to Day;
And, let no good occasion slip away.
Now rend your hearts, ye Britains, wash and rinse them
From all corruption: from all evil cleanse them.
Go offer up the pleasing sacrifice
Of Righ^eousnesse: from folly turn your eyes.
Seek peace, and follow it, with strict pursuit:
Relieve the needy; Judgment execute:
Refresh the weary; right the fatherless:
The strangers, and the widows wants redress:
Give praise to God; depend with lowly faith,
O^ him; and what his holy Spirit says:
R^member what a price thy ransom cost;
And, now redeem the time that thou have lost.
Return, ret^^ne thou (oh backsliding Nation)
And, let thy tears prevent thy desolation.
As yet, thou may return; for, Gods embrace
Is open ^or thee, if thou have the grace,
To give it meeting* Yet, repentance may
Prevent the mischiefs of that evil day,
Which here is menace'd: yet, thou may have peace,
And by dis^reet endeavo^ing, enc^ease
Each outward grace, and every inward thing*
W^i^h will additions to thy comfo^t bring.
If this thou do; these fea^full threatenings all,
(Repea^ed h^re) to mercies change he shall.
We cannot say, it will excuse thee from
All cha^^isement; or that no blow shall come.
For, peradv^nt^re, thou so long have bin
Vnpe^i^ent, that some loud-cring sin
Has waked that V^ngeance, which upon thy crimes
Mu^t fall (as once in Ier^mi^hs (...))
Without pr^vention; to ex^mplifie
Gods hate of sin to all posterity.
But, sure we are, that if he does not stay
H^^ threa^ned hand, the stroke that he does lay
Will fall the lighter; and become a bl^ssing,
Thy future joys, and virtues more encreafing*
Then all that larg^ prosperity and rest
Which thou, so long together, have possessed.
God (wi^h a wr^ters ^^ke horn) one has sent,
To set a mark on them that shall repent;
And bids him promi^e in his N^me, that they
Who shall (recantin^) leave their evil way,
And in their heart^, bewail the grievous crimes,
And miserie^ of Sion, in their times;
That they shall be secure, and s^^ed from
The hand of these D^stroye^s* which must come:
Or else by their dest^ucti^n find a way
To that repairing which will ne^re d^cay.
Yea thou, oh Britain! if thou could reform
Thy manners, might expel the dreadful storm
Now threatened; and thy foes (who triumph would,
The ruin of thy glory to behold*
And jeere thee when thou fallest) soon s^all see
Thy God returning, and avenging thee
On their insultings: yea, with angry blows
He would effect their shameful overth^owes.
Or turn their hearts. For when from sin men cease,
God makes their enemies, and them, at peace.
Moreover, thou shall have in thy poss^ssing,
Each inward grace* and every ou^ward blessing;
Thy fruit^ull H^rds shall in ^ich pastures feed;
Thy soil shall plentiously increase thy seed;
Thy Flock, shall neither Shepherds want nor meat;
Clean provander, thy stabled beast shall ^at^;
There shall be Rivers in thy Dales; and Fountains
Upon the tops of all thy noblest Moun^aines:
The Moon shall cast upon thee beams as bright
As now the Sun; and with a sevenfold l^ght
The Sun shall bl^sse thee* He that reigns in thee,
To all his people reconciled shall be;
And they shall find themselves no whit deceived,
In those good hopes which are of him conceived:
But he, (and they, wh^ shall his throne possess
When he is gone) shall reign in righteousness;
And be more careful of thy weal (by far)
Then parents of their childrens p^ofits are
Thy Magistra^e^, with wisdom shall proceed
In all that shall be cou^ell'd or decreed.
As Harbors, when it blows tempestuously;
As Rivers, unto places over-d^y;
As Shadows a^e to men oppressed with heat;
As to a hungry stomac^, wholsom^ meat;
To thee, so welcom^, and as much con^enting,
Thy Nobles will become, on thy repenting.
Thy Priests shall preach true doctrine in thy Teples;
And make it fruitful by their good examples.
Thy God, with righteousness shall them array,
And hear and answer them, when they do pray.
Thy eyes, that much are blinded, shall be clear;
Thy ea^es that yet are deafned, then shall hear;
Thy tongue, that s^a^mers now, shall then sp^ak plain;
Thy heart shall perfect understanding gain;
The preaching of the Gospel shall increase;
Thy God shall make thy comforts and thy peace,
To flow as does a River; they who plant,
The blessing of their labor shall not want;
Thy poorest people shall at full be fed;
The meek, shall of no ty^a^t stand in dread;
Thou shall have grace and knowledge, to avoid
Those things, whereby thy r^st may be annoid;
T^ou shall poss^sse thy wished bl^ssings all;
And, God shall hear thee still before thou call.
But, as a Chime, whose ^rets disord red grow,
Can never cause it self in t^ne to go,
Nor chime at all, until some cunning hand
Does make the same again in order stand:
Or, as the Clock, whose plummers are not weight,
Strike^ sometimes one for three, and six for eight;
So fares it with men and kingdoms all,
When once from their integrity they fall.
They may their motion ^urry out of frame,
But have no power to r^ctifie the same
That curious hand which first those pieces wrought,
Must mend them still; or they will still be naught.
To thee I therefore now my speech convert,
Thou famous Artist, who Creator art
Of heaven and earth, and of those goodly spheres,
That now have whirled many thousand years,
(And shall until thy pleasure ^ives it ending)
In their perpetual motion, without mending.
Oh! be thou pleased, by thy powerful hand,
To set in order this depraved Land.
Our whole foundation, Lord, is out of course;
And every thing still grows worse and wor^e;
The way that leads quite from thee, we have took;
Thy Covenant, and all thy Laws are b^oke;
In mischiefs, and in folly, is our pleasure;
Our crying sins have almost filled their measure;
Yet, every day we add a new transgressi^n,
And still abuse thy favor and compassion.
Our Governors, our Prelates, and our Nobles,
Have by their sins increase, encreast our trou^les.
Our Priests, and all the People, have misgone;
All kind of evil deeds, we all have done.
We have not lived as those means of ^race
Require, which thou have granted to this place:
But ^ather wo^se then many who have had
Less^ helps then we, of being better made.
No Nation under heaven so lewd has bin,
That had so many w^rnings for their sin,
And such perpetual callings on, as we,
To leave our wickedness, and turn to thee.
Yet, we in stead of turning, further went;
And when thy Mercies and thy Plagues were sent
To pull us back; they seldom wrought our stay,
Or moved to repentance one whole day.
No blessing* no affliction, has a power
To move compunction i^ us, for one hour,
Unless thou work it. All that I can speak
(And all that I have spoken) till thou break
And mollify the heart, will fruitless be,
Not only in my hearers, but in me.
I^ thou p^epare not way for more esteem
All these Remembrances will foolish seem.
Nay these, in stead of moving to repent,
Will indignation move and discontent;
Which will men's ha^dned hearts obdurate more,
And make their fault much greater then before.
Unless thou give a ^lessing, I may strive
As well to make a marble stone alive,
As to effect my p^rpo^e: yea, all this
Like wholesome counsel to a mad man is,
And, I for my good meaning shall be torn
In pieces, or exposed be to scorn.
^or, they against thy word do stop their ear;
And, wild in disobedience, will not hear.
In this, we all confess ourselves to blame,
And that we therefore have deserved shame.
Yea, Lord we do acknowledge, that for this
There noth^ng else to us pertaining is,
(Respecting our own worth) but desolation,
And final ^ooting ou^, without compassion.
But gracious God, though such our merit be,
Yet, ^ercy f^ll pertains unto thee.
To thee the act of pard'ning and forgiving,
As much belongs (oh Father everliving)
As plagues to us: and it were better far
Our sins had less then their deservings are,
Then that thy Clemency should be outgone,
By al^ the wickedness that can be done.
As well as theirs whose lives now left them have,
Thou can command those bodies from the gr^ve,
Who slink, and putrify, and buried be
In their corruption. Such, oh Lord! are we.
Oh! call us from this grave; and show thy power
Upon this much polluted Land of our,
Which is not only sick of works unholy,
But almost dead and buried in her folly.
Forgive us all our slips, our negl^gences,
Our sins of knowledge, and our ignorances;
Our daring wickedness; our bl^ody crimes;
And all the faults of past and p^esent times.
Permit not thy just wrath to burn for ^ver;
In thy displeasure do not still persever;
But, call us from that pit of Death, and Sin,
And from that path of Hell which we are in.
Remember, that this Vineyard has a Vine,
Which had her planting by that hand of thine.
Remember, when from Egypt thou remov'dst it,
With what entire affection, then, thou lov'dst it.
How thou did weed and dress it heretofore;
How thou did fence it from the forest Bore;
And think* how sweet a vintage then it brought,
When thy first work upon her thou had wrought*
Remember, that without thy daily care,
The choicest plants, soon wild and fruitless are;
And, that as long as thou do prune and dress,
The sowrest Vine shall bring a sweet ^ncrease.
R^member, also Lord, how still that Foe,
W^^ first pu^sued us* does seek to sow
His ^ares among thy wheat; and to his power,
B^eak down^ thy fence, and trample, and devour
The seeds of grace, as soon as they do sprout;
And is to^ strong, for us to keep him out.
O^! let not him prevail, such harm to do us,
As he desires, but, Lord, re^urne unto us.
Return in merry. Though thou find us slack
To come our selves, f^tch, draw, and pull us back
From our own courses, by thy grace divine,
And set, and keep us, in each way of thine.
We from our foes have saved been by thee;
And in thy love, oh Lord! triumphed we.
But now behold, disgraced thou throw'st us by,
And we before our adversaries fly.
A^ us our neighb^ring Nations laugh and jeere,
And, us they ^co^ne, whom late we made to fear.
Oh God a^ise, reject us not for aye;
No longer hide from us thy face away:
But, come, oh come with speed to give u^aid,
And let us not be lost though we have straid.
Vouchsafe that every one in his degree,
The secret errors of his life may see;
And, in his l^wfull calling* all his days,
Pe^forme his Christian duty, to thy praise*
Give peace this troublous age; for, perilous
The times are grown, and no man fights for us
But thou oh God! nor do we seek or crave,
That any other Champion we may have.
Nay give us troubles, if thy will be ^o,
That we may have thy strength to bear them too;
And in affliction thee more glorify,
Then heretofore in our prosperity.
For when thy countenance on us did shine,
Those Lands that boasted of their corn and wine,
Had not that joy which thou di^st then inspire,
When we were boyld and fryde in blood and fire.
Oh! give again that joy, although it cost us
Our lives. Restore thou what our sin has lost us
Thy Church, in these Dominions Lord preserve
In purity: and teach us thee to serve
^n holiness and righteousness, until
We shall the number of our days fulfill.
Defend these Kingdoms from all overthrowes,
^y foreign enemies, or homebred foes.
Our King with ev'^y grace and virtue bless,
Which may thine honor and his own increase.
Inflame our Nobl^s with mo^e love and zeal,
To thy true Spouse, and to this Common w^ale.
Inspire our ^lergie in their several places,
With knowledge, and all sanct^^ying g^aces;
That by their liv^s and doct^ines they may rear
Th^se part^ of Syon, which decayed are.
Awake ^his People, give them souls that may
Believe thy word, and thy commands obey.
The Plagues deserved already, save them from.
More wa^ch^ull make them, in all times to come.
For blessings past. let hearty thanks be given.
For present ones, let sacrifice to heaven
Be daily offered up. For what is needing
(Or may be useful in the time succeeding)
Let faithful prayers to thy throne be sent,
With hearts and ^ands upright and innocent:
And let all this the better fu^thred be,
Through these Rem^mbrances, now b^ough^ by me.
For which high favor* and emboldning thus
My spirit, in a time so dangerous;
For choosing me, that am so despi^able,
To be employed in this honorable
And great employment* (which I more ^steeme,
Then to be crowned with a Diadem)
For thy enabling me in this Embassage;
For bringing to conclusion this my Message;
For sparing of my l^fe, when thousands died,
Before, behind me, and on every side;
For saving of me many a time since then,
When I had fo^feited my soul again;
For all those griefs and poverties, by which
I am in better things made great, and rich,
Then all that wealth and honor brings man to,
Wherewith the wo^ld does keep so much ado:
For all which thou to me on earth have given;
For all, w^i^h does concern my hopes of heaven;
For these, and those innumerable graces,
Vouchsafed me, at sundry times, and places,
(Vn^hought upon) unsained praise I render:
And, for a living s^crifice, I tender
To thee (oh God) my body, soul, and all,
Which mine I may, by thy donation, call.
Accept it blessed Maker, for his sake
Who did ^his offering acceptable m^ke,
By giving up himself. Oh! look thou no^
Upon those blem^shes which I have got
By natural corruption; or by those
Polluted acts which from that ulcer flows.
According to my ^kill, I have enrolled
Thy Merci^s; and thy Justice I have told.
I have not h^d thy workings in my breast;
But a^ I could, their power I have expressed.
Among our great assemblies, to declare
Thy will and pleasure, lo, I do not f^a^e:
And th^ugh by Princes I am checked and blamed*
To sp^ake ^he truth, I am no whit ashamed.
Oh! show thou, Lord, thy mercy so to me,
And let thy love and Truth, my guardians be.
Forgive me all the foll^es of my youth;
My f^ul^y deeds; the errors of my mo^th;
The wanderings o^ my heart, and every one
Of those good works that I have lest undone.
Forgive me all wherein I did amiss,
Since thou ^mployd'st me in performing this:
My d^ublings of thy calling ^e unto it;
My f^are^, which often di^heartned me to do it;
My sloth, my negligences, my evasions,
And my defe^ring it, on vain occasions,
When I had vowed that no wo^ke of mine,
Should take me up, till I had finished thine.
Lord, pardon this; and let no future sin,
Nor what already has committed bin,
Profane this W^rke; or cause the same to be
The less effectual to this land, or me.
But to my self (oh Lord) and others, let it
So moving be, that we may never fo^get it.
Let nor the evil, nor the good effect
It takes, or puff me up, or me deject:
Or make me think that I the better am,
Because I tell how others a^e to bl^ame:
But, let it keep me in a Christian fear,
Still humbly heedfull what my actions are.
Let all those observations I have had,
Of others er^or^, be occasions made
To min^ me of mine own. And, lest I err,
Let every man be my Remembrancer;
With so much charity, as I have sought
To b^ing their duties more into their thought.
And, i^ in any sin I linger long*
Without repentance; Lord, let every tongue
That n^m^s me, check me for it: and, to me
B^come, what I to others feign would be.
Oh! let me not be like those busy broomes,
Which having cleansed many nasty rooms,
Do make themselves the fouller: but sweet Father,
Let me be like the preci^us Diamond rather,
Which does by polishing another stone,
The better shape and luster, set upon
H^s own rou^h body. Let my life be such,
As that man's ought to be, who knows much
Of thy good pleasure. And, most awful God,
Let none of those, who sp^ead of me abroad
Unjust reports, the Dev^lls pu^pose gain,
By making these my warning^ prove in vain
To those that hear them: but let such disgraces,
Reflect with shame, upon their Authors fac^s,
Till they repent. And let their scandal se^ve
Within my heart true me^k^^sse to preserve;
And that humili^y, which else, perchance,
Vain glory, ot some natural arrogance
Might ove^throw, if I should think upon
(With carnal thoghts) some good my lines have done
Restrai^e, moreover, them who out of pride,
Or igno^ance, this Labor shall deride.
Make them perceive, who shall prefer a story
Composed ^or some temporal friends glory,
Before those Poems which thy works declare,
That vain and witless their opinions a^e:
And if by thee I was appointed, Lord,
Thy Judgments and thy Mercies to record,
(As here I do) set thou thy mark on those,
Who shall despightfully the same oppose:
And let it p^^likely be seen of all,
Till of their malice they repent them shall.
As I my conscience have disch^rged here,
Without concealing ought for love, or fear;
From furious men let me preserved be,
And from the scorn of ^ooles deliver me*
Vouchsafe at length some com^orting refection,
According to the years of my affliction.
On me, for good, some to^en please to show,
That they who see it, may thy bounty know;
Rejoice, with fellow-fe^ling of the some,
And join with me, in praising of thy Name.
And lest (oh Lord!) some weak ones may despise
My word^, because of ^uch necessities,
As they h^ve b^ou^ht upon me, by their spite,
Who ^o my S^udie h^ve been opposite:
Oh! give me that which may suffic^ent be,
To make them know that I have served thee.
And that my labors are by thee regarded,
Although they seem not outwardly rewarded.
Those Honors, or that Wealth, I do not crave,
Which they affect, who most end^vored have
To please the World. I only ask to gain
But food and raiment, Lord, for all my pain;
And that the ^launders, and the poverties,
Wherewith my patience thou shall exercise,
Make not these Lines, or me, become a scorn,
Nor leave me to the world-ward, quite forlorn.
Yet, in preferring of this humble Suit,
I make not my request so absolute,
As that I will capitula^e, or tie
^o such conditions, thy d^ead Majesty.
For, if to honor bu^ an eart^ly Prince
My Muse had sung* it had been impudence
To p^ompt his bounty; or, to doubt he might
Forget to do my honest Labors right.
Do therefore as thou please: only give
Thy Servant grace contentedly to live,
And to be ^hankfull, wha^soever shall
In thi^ my weary Pil^rimage befall.
Such things thou do command me to require,
With earnest, and an absolute desire:
With which I come: beseeching I may find
Thy love continue, though none else be kind;
That blessedness ete^nall I may get,
Though all I lose on earth, to compass it;
And that, at last, when my account is eaven,
My payment may be summoned up in heaven.
Lord, this will p^ease me: call me quickly thithe^,
And pay me there my wages all together:
Not that which mine by merit seems to be;
But, what by thy mere ^race is due to me.
The Conclusion.
SO now (though not so fally as I ^^ght)
My Vow is paid; and to an end is brought
T^is work, for which God pleased my life to spare,
When thousand^ round about me slaughtred were.
N^w, live or dye I care rot: for I see
But little useful^esse, or need of me.
Because no^e knows what God may call him to;
I will not say precisely what I Will do:
But, in ^his kind of muzing, to endeavor,
Or he employed again, I purpose never.
For, if this ^rofit not, it will be vain
For me to strike upon this st^in^ again*
If these do not prevail, I shall suppose,
Words are not wanting here so much as blows*
And that the filthy will be filthy s^ill,
Till they the measure of their sin f^lfill:
Or, that God will to f^ee us from pollution,
Put some ^^^sall Plague in execution.
Whi^^ ^o prevent, to him I Will humbly pray,
And, whilst I live, ende^vor what I may
My Cou^t^ies welfare; se^king means to find,
To spen^ for her avail, my days behind;
And lab^ring so, my Talent to employ,
That I may come in^o my Masters joy.
And, though (when all is done which I am able)
My service will be but unprofitable:
Yet, still I will be doing, that, when he
Shall come, I be not idle found to be.
If any blame what is or shall be done;
My Conscience k^oweth I would injure none;
And that I do not meddle further, than
Becomes me that am a priva^e man,
Though otherwise it seem to those who weigh not
When private men may spe^ke, and when they may not.
The buildin^ of a Town we do preserre
Unto the Mason and the Carpenter;
But, when it is on fire, we care no^ who
Does come to quench it, so the same he do.
And, thoug^ in settled times, the Statutes awe
The ruder sort, sometime there is Martial Law.
It Is true indeed, that ordinary times,
And those that are but ordinary crimes,
May by the Common Justice be amended,
And should not be by others repre^ended;
Except it be in terms, respecting all
States* persons, times, and sin in g^nerall.
Yet (as King David says) If overthrown
Foundations be; what then amiss i^ done,
By honest men, if God to show our fall,
Shall some, in extraordinary, call?
We now have those that neither stand in awe
Of ordinary Magistrate, or Law.
Nay, Law is made a mockage, and a scorn,
And, they who have appointed been, and sworn
To j^dge us by ^he Laws, deny their power,
Except, when they may serv^ them to devour.
We now have sinners, who are got above
The reach of men appoin^ed to reprove
In ordinary course. Yea, sins have we,
Which brook not, touched, or mentioned to be:
No not so much as prayed against, through fear
Of ^ngring those that their well willers ^re.
And, this ^reat impudency daily grows
So str^ng that all our freedome^ we shall lose,
And Natures Laws e're long will all be brok^n,
If none should speak; and therefore I have spok^n.
And ^f for this I may not live as fr^e
As I was borne (and as I ought to be)
I hope to dye, do malice what it can,
An ho^est and a constant Englishman,
Whose fall shall be no ble^ish to his Name;
But, in^am^ to those, who caus^d the same.
But, s^ffer this (will Politicians dream)
An^, such a president will hearten them
To libellize, who wanting grace, and reason,
D^vulge t^eir sharp-fang'd Poems out of season:
And they who Write for nothing but to show
Their spleens, or that the world may come to know
Their Facul^y, men's persons may abuse,
And brave it thus, their boldness to excuse.
But, wh^t is this to me? (If others will
Because I have done well, be doing ill)
Let them and those, whom thereby they offend,
About that matter, by themselves contend.
It Is fit for so^er men their swo^ds to wear,
Altho^gh by drunkard they abus^d are.
Which freedom I* have claim^d, and used you see;
And from the claim will never bea^en be.
In every Work* some passage will discover
To k^ow^ng men, what was the ch^ef^st mo^ver:
Which ^hey who have the Spirit of d^scerning,
Should mark; for, it is a matte worth the learning.
And, when they find an Autho^ should be shent,
Let him receive his worthy chastisement.
But, when his pains deserves a rew^rd,
Affl^ct him not, though him you naught regard.
A Libeller is impudently bold,
When he has Times, or Patrons to uphold
His biting Strains; and soon is he descried;
For ^e, to strike all faults, is t^rrifi'd:
And fears what perils may his act attend,
If none ^e knows save God to be his Friend.
But, they who have my mind, will be so far
From fear to write, although you do not spare
To punish me, that they will write the more;
Make up the sum that ^anteth on my score;
And, reprehensions forth so loud will thunder,
That at your follies time^ to come will wonder.
For, outward hopes, have not my tongue unloo^'d,
Nor can my mouth by outw^rd fears be closed.
What I have done is done: and I am ^as^d,
And ^lad, how ever others will be pleased.
Let t^em who shall p^ruse it, praise, or lau^h,
Revile or s^^ffe, or threat, or swear, or chase,
All Is one to me; So I within be still,
Without me, let men keep what noise they will,
For, sure I am, though they my flesh confound,
The soul, I seek to save, shall still be sound*
And this I know, that nor the br^t^sh rages
Of ^his ^ow p^esent, or succeeding Ages,
Shall root this Poem out; but, that to all
Ensuing times, the same continue shall,
To be perused in this Land, as long
As here they shall retain the English tongue:
Or, while there shall be Errors, and offenses,
Disorders, Discords, Plagues, or Pestilences.
And, if our evils we depar^ not from,
Before the d^y of our destruction come,
This Book shall to the times that follow show,
What sin^ they were which caus^d our overthrow:
And testify to others (for their learnin^)
That Vengeance did not seize us without warning.
If they who know the state of this our Land,
Can justly say that her Affairs do stand
In such a posture as was ordinary;
Or, that these Times the face d^e seem to carry
Which they have had: or, if they see not here,
More wants, more doubts, and ter^ors, then therewere:
Or, if ^his Message (whatsoever succedeth)
Be more (or more insisted on) t^en needs:
Or, if it gives any just suspicion
That thence may spring o^casions of sedition;
Nay if that ^ll my Rea^^rs may not g^ther
Good mot^ves thence, to (...) ^edition, rather*
And such like me^nes of r^^^ifying that
Which is, or may be har^full to the State:
Let me be strictly ques^^on^d, an^ blamed,
And conf^r'd too; as one that has defamed
Or inj^red his Country. Or, if they
Who shall per^se this Book, can truly say,
That I have caused this REMEMBRANCER
To spe^ke l^ke every v^lgar Messenger;
If any c^rcumstance ca^ prove, I bend
My purposes to wo^ke my private end;
Or, that I persons scandalize, o^ fl^tter;
Or that I in the manner, or the matter,
Resembl^ such a Pamphl^ter, as fears
The losing of his lib^rties, or ears:
O^, that I speak^ like them who railing come,
They neither ^^re at what, nor yet at whom,
So they may rail; Or, if I have not showed
My Messages from such a Spirit flowed,
As is well known unto him, and whereby
He can def^nd them, with good warrantly:
If these, or ought like th^se things may be said,
(To prove the part of an Impostor played)
Let him who thinks he can unmask me, strive
To do it, and as he shall do, b^leeve.
But if they find (which doubtless they shall find)
Who view this Poem with a single mind)
That I have here delivered things exceeding
My me^ne* of knowledge, or my he^ps of breeding,
So far, as that my Readers cannot choose
B^t know some power divine d^d them infuse:
If they shall find, by my confessions h^re,
That I am subject to the self same fear
Which others feel; and yet have dare^ more
In some respects, then others heretofore:
If they ^erceive, that I did often desire
Thro^gh frailty, from this action to retire;
And, that I had a supernat^^^ll W^ll,
My natural Desi^es resisting st^ll,
An^ forcing me, even in my own despite,
That ^atter of this Volume to en^ite:
If they perceive, as well per^eiue they may,
That I had ma^y lets within my way,
So cumbersome, as made the ^ork a^peare
Scarce possible* to him that w^lling were;
And, how God made such hindrances become
More helpful at the last, then troubl^some.
If they observe, how when my fortunes all
At hazard lay (and were to stand or fall
According to their wills, who may, with me,
For this, if God forbid not a^^^y be)
That I, though many did the same condemn,
Did (this to finish) quite give ever them,
Which then I might have settled; had I thought
Gods kingdom ought not first to have been sought.
If they did know how we^l I know the rage,
The sottishness, and malice of this age;
How little conscience some do make to kill,
Oppress, or ruinate, to get their will;
Or what small means, or hope of friends I have,
My body from their violence to save:
If these, and such like things as these were heeded,
All these preventions should not now have needed:
For, they would see, this had not been effected,
Unless Gods hand had strengthened and directed*
And they who else my person may contemn,
Would fear, that they in me would injure him.
I know, some please to say, that thus I vent
Bold words; because I seek imprisonment:
As if to me thereby there might arise
A profit, by concealed G^atuities.
Thus many Schismatics indeed have done,
And honest men and women preyed upon,
To charities abuse: But, God does know
That yet, with me it never has been so:
But that my heart both scor^es and h^tes to be
So false and base, as these d^e ^ensure me.
I do, and will confess unto the praise
Of him, who unto me my friends did raise,
That when I did, in thrall oppressed grow,
With wants, which none but G^d and I did know;
And was mewed up so close, that to no friend,
I might a Prayer, or Petition send,
But unto God: he moved the hearts of some
To se^d me su^cour: And, I vow, to whom,
Except to him, I should my thanks repay,
(For much there^f) I know not to thi^ day.
It was enough to show me, that God will
In all extremes, provide things nee^full s^ill.
And decently, and well did it suffice
In my restraint, for all nec^ssities.
But, what soever some think, I brought not forth
Into the world with we, one farthing worth
Above my charge: but, there just eaven made
Of all which from Gods bountious hand I had.
For, what was more then served to set me free,
I gave to others, as he gave to me.
Which, not in boast, I mention; but, I speak
The truth, that this the more effect may take.
A foo^^sh policy in me it were
(For such a base uncertain^y as here
Objected is) to venture as I do
The ^^sse of that which I had rea^ht unto
F^re now: had this been left, to settle that
Which does concern my ^emp^rall estate.
The King has shown me favor: at this hour,
I do not know that ^an, of Name, or power
Whose person I envy, or disaffect,
Or whom of any malice I suspe^t
To me o^ mine: with me they all are friends,
That were at odds; and to attain my ends
In my ^ff^ires, I never had a day
So probable as now, if I would stay
This Message: and perchance, this bring me shall
In all my outward ho^es unto a fall;
Yet, this shall first be told, that you may see,
My Hopes are greater, then my Fears can be;
And that it may be known, I d^e disclaim
Those ends, at which most think I basely aim.
These Arguments, as such like words as may
Anticipate, I here, beforehand, say;
Not that I think it possible, by them
To change their minds that will this Book contemn,
For, it is not in the power of Argument,
Or words, to make the wilful provident.
It lies not in honest prot^stations
To overthrow malicious combinations;
No nor in Miracles, till God shall please
(Who of all hearts does keep the locks and keys,
To shut and open them*) For they that heard
And lived to see fulfilled, what was declared
By Jeremy against Jerusalem;
His counsel they did nathelesse contemn,
When he their slight to Egypt did oppose;
And so became of their own overthrowes
The wilful cause. Nay, when our Savior spoke
To Judas, and that Band which came to take
His person; to the ground those men he struck
Even with his voice: and, on the Cross, he shook
The Earth, and rent the Temple with his cry;
Yet, that and all the rest was passed by
Of most beholders, a if they had been
Insensible of what was heard and seen.
I therefore, these Preventions do insert,
To aggravate the hardness of their heart
Who shall be obstinate. And here declare
What may be said or done, e're done they are;
That all may know, when such things come to pass
Naught falls on me, but what expected was;
And that the better working this may have
On those who shall Gods Messages receive
^y this Remembrancer. For, God has sent,
Though I (unworthy) am his instrument.
Him, unadvisedly composed I not,
Nor was he by a miracle begot.
To fit him for this purpose; I have thrice
Imprisonment endured: Close-prison twice.
Much trouble I have past which thence ensued;
Through wants and slanders not a few I s^ru'd;
And, being guarded by Gods Providence,
I lately walked through the Pestilen^e,
And saw, and felt, what Nature does abhor,
To harden me, and to prepare me for
This Work. And therefore he, who thinks he shall
Wit^ his big looks or speeches me appall,
Must look more grim then Death; more ugly, far,
Then Vizards, or the shapes of Devils are;
Breathe ranker poison then a plague filled grave;
And stamp, and rore, and tear, and stare, and rave,
More dreadfully, and louder then a man
Infected with six Pestilences can:
Else; I (to play with terrors being borne)
Shall laugh both him and all he does, to scorn.
And, though I may, perchance (as did the best
Of all ^ods children when they were oppressed)
Sometime bewail my sufferings, or declare
That I do feel them when their weight I bear;
Yet murmur will I not, at what is laid
Upon me, neither seek to flesh for aid.
By what is here done, may trouble come upon me;
But, not performing it, had quite undone me:
Since, I through fear of what the world may do,
Neglected had, what God had called me to.
For, of his calling me, the, means and ways
Wh^reby my weakness he to this did raise,
Unquestionable evidence do give.
And, they who do not, yet, the same believe,
Will think the same, perhaps, when they shall see
Themselves enclosed with new Plagues to be.
Thus I believing, and considering,
What fearlesnesse this act therewith does bring,
(With what assurances, I do possess)
Me thinks it were a matchless wickedness
To disobey. Yea sure, I more in that
Wronged God, then I shall seem to wrong the State*
In uttring what some few are loath to hear.
How ever diverse think; this is my fear.
Yea, to my soul, so horrible a thing
The wilful disobeying that great King
Appeared has; that, never should I sleep
In peace again, if I did silence keep.
And therefore, neither all the royal graces
Of Kings; nor gifts, nor honorable places,
Should stop my mouth. Nor would I smother this,
Though twenty Kings had sworn that I should kis^e
The Gallows for it: lest my Conscience should
Torment me more, then all men living could.
Yea, though this mind were but my ignorance,
Or fancy (as it will be thought, perchance)
Yet, since this Fancy may present to me
As hideous fears, as things that real be,
I Will hazard rather twenty deaths to dye,
Then to be tortured by my Fantasy.
For, I had rather in a dungeon dwell
Five years; then in my soul to seele a hell
Five minutes: and, so God will be my friend,
I shall not care how many I offend.
And, yet, (now I remember) troubled is
My heart a little, for one thing amiss
Which I have done. This M^ssenger has bin
Long time kept out; and I did thrust him in
Without a License; lest he coming late,
Might show you a Commission out of date.
I could excuse the fact, and lay the crime
Upon the much disorder of the time:
For, most men know, that in a Watch or Clock^
When it is out of order once or broke,
The wheels that are unfaul^^e move awry
As well as they in whom the faults do lie.
But, that you may not think I do profess
Against the State, as wholly merciless,
Or that I think it nothing to misdoe
Against good Order, though compelld th^^eto;
For this I ask forgiveness; and submit
My self to them, who shall in judgment sit
Upon the fact. For which if I obtain
My Pardon, I shall humbly entertain
Their favors with my thankefullest respects,
And, hope this Message will have good effects.
If otherwise I find; my Body shall
Be ready to subject it self to all
Their strictest Penalties: and when I am
Enough affl^cted for what is to blame
In this, or me: I know, God will release
By Body, or my Soul, again in peace.
To him alone, for Patronage, I run:
Lord, let thy pleasure, and thy will be done.
The glory be to God.
THe faults escaped in the printing, we had not such means to prevent as we
desired; nor could we conveniently collect them, by reason of our have, of
hazard, and other interruptions: we therefore leave them to be amended,
censured, and winked at, according to the Readers courtesy or discretion.
