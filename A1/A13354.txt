(...) fortuned that in a market town in the count of Suffolk there was a
stage play in the which play one called John^ adroyns which (...) dwelled in a
another vyllage.ii. mile from thens playde the dyuyll And when the play was done
this John^ adroyns in the euynyng departed fro the said market town to go
home to his own house and because he hao there no change of clothyng he went
forth in his dyuylls aprell which in the way coming home ward came through a
waren of conys be logyng to a gentylma^ of the vyllage where he him self dwelt
At which time it fortuned a priest a vycar of a church thereby with.ii. or.iii.
other unthrifty felows had brought with the^ a horse a hey and ^ feret to
the^tent there to get conys and when the feret was in ye yerth and the hey set
over the path way where this John^ a^^oyns should come this pressed and his other
felows saw him come in the dyuyls raiment co^sideryng that they were i^ the
dyuyls service and stelyng of conys and supposyng it had been the devil in deed
for fere ran away This John^ adroyns i^ the dyuyls raiment and because it was
so^what dark saw not ye hay but went forth i^ have (...) lid thereat and fell
down that with the fall he had almost broken his nek But when he was a little
reuyuyd he lokyd up and spyed it was a hay to catch conys and lokyd further and
saw that they ran away for fere of hi^ / and saw a horse tied to a bush laden
with conys which they had taken and he took the horse and the hay and lept
upon the horse and rode to ye ge^tylmannys place that was lord of the waren to
the ente^te to have thank for taking such a pr^y And when he came / knokyd at
the gatys To whom anon one of the gentylmannys seruauntys asked who was there
/ and sodeinly opened the gate and as soon as he perceived him in the deuyls
raiment was suddenly abashed and sparryd the door again / and went in to his
master / and said and swear to his master that the dyuell was at the gate /
and would come in The gentylman heryng him say so called another of his
seruauntys and had him go to the gate to know who was there / This second
seruan^t came to the gate durst not open it / but asked with loud voice who was
there this John^ Adroyns in the dyuyls apar^^ (...) swered with a hye voice and
said Tell thy master I must nedys speak with him or I go This second servant
heryng (...) the devil in deed that is at the gate ly^tynge upon (...) souls,
and be lykelyho^^ he income for your soul pur^ (...) your soul / and if he
had yoar soul I wene he should (...) man than meruaylously abashed, called
his ch^^layne (...) dell be ^ight and get holy water and went to the gate
(...) uantes as durst go with him / where the chaplayne wit (...) iuracyon
said. In the name of the father, son, and ho (...) and charge the in the holy
name of god, to tell me (...) comeste hither. This John^ Adroynes in the deny

that were stolen in (...) and their horse and their hay, and made them for
fear to run (...) when they hard him thus speak, by his voice knew him
we (...) and opened the gate and let him come in. And so all the foresaid fe
(...) was turned to myrthe and disporte.

By this tale ye may se that men fear many times more than they need, which
has caused men to believe that sperytes and deuyls have ben seen in diverse
places, when it has been nothing so.

THere was a rich man which lay fore sick in his bed to fore his eldest

(...) Vniuersyte of Oxeforde, there was a scoler that delyted much (...) peke

said this wise. Cobbler I pray the set (...) angyls and two semy cercles

understood him not half (...) ^ered shortly and said. Sir your eloquence
passes mine intelly^^ (...) But I promise you if he meddyll with me, the
clowtynge of your (...)ll cost you three pens.

By this tale men may learn that it is folly to study to speak (...) ^uently
before them that be rude and unlearned.

A Certain artificer in london there was which was sore (...) could not well
dysgest his meat to whom a physicyon (...) him council and said that he must
use to ete metis ye belig (...) gestyo^ and small byrdys as sparowes swalowes
and spe^yally that byr (...) called a wagtayle whose flessh is meruelouse light
of dygestyon (...) byrd is ever mouyng and styryng The sekeman her^nge ye
phelicion say so answered him and said / Sir if that be the cause yt hose
birds be light of dygestyon. Than I know a mete much lyghter of dygestyon than
other sparow swallow or wagtaile and that is my wyue^ to (...) for it is never
in rest but ever meuyng and sterryng.

By this tale ye may learn a good general rule of physyke.

A woman there was which had had.iiii. husb^ndys It fourtuned al so that this
fourth husband dyed and was brought to ^^yrche upon the bear / whom this woman
followed and made great moan and waxed very sorry in so much that her neighbors
thought she would swown and dye for sorrow / wherefore one of her gosseps came to
her and spoke to her in her ere and bad her for godds sake comfort her self and
refrain that lame^ tato^n or else it would hurt her and perauenture put her in
ieopardy of herlife To whom this woman answered and said I wys good gosyp I
have great^ause to morn if ye knew all for I have beryed.iii. husbands bysyde
this man but I was never in ye case that I am now / for there was not one of
the^ but when ye I folowid the corse to church yet I was sure of an another
husband before ye corse came out of my house and now I am sure of no another
husband and therefore ye may be sure I have great cause to be sad and heavy.

A By this tale ye may se that the old proverb is true that it is as great
pity to se a woman weep as a gose to go barefote.

Another woman there was yt knelyo at the mas of requie^ while the corse of her
husband lay on the bear in ye church. To whom a yongema^ came and spoke with
her in her ere as though it had been for some matter concerning ye funerallys /
how be it he spoke of on such matter but only wowyd her ye he might be her
husband / to whom she answered and said thus Sir by my truth I am sorry ye
ye come so late for I am sped all ready For I was made sure yester day to
another man.

A By this tale ye may perceive that women often times be wise and loathe to
lose any time.

Merchant that thought to deride a mylner said unto the mylner sitting among
company / Sir I have hard say that every true mylner that tollyth trewly has
a gylden thombe / ye myllner answered and said it was true Than quod y^
merchant I pray ye let me se thy thombe and when y^ mylner she wyd his thombe
ye merchant said I can not perceive that thy thombe is gylt but it is as all
other men's thombes be / to whom (...) answered and said / Sir treuthe it is
that my tho^be is gylt (...) t ye have no power to se it for there is a
properte ever incydent (...) hat he that is acockolde shall never have power to

Ne which was called Oconer an yrysshe lord took an horsman (...) ^risoner
that wis one of his great enimys / which for any request or intretyt hat the
horanan made gave judgment that he should inconrynent be hanged and made a
friar to shryue him and bad him make he^ ready to dye. This friar y^ shr^ue him
examyned him of diverse sins and asked him among other which were ye
gretteste sins ye euerhe did this horse man answered and said one of the
greatest actys that ever I did which I now most repent is yt when I took
Oconer the last weke in a church and there I might have brennyd him church
and all and because I had conscience and pity of brennyng of ye church I
tarried ye time so long ye oconer escaped / and that same deferring of
brennynge of ye church and so long taryeng of that time is one of ye worst
acts yt ever I did whereof I must repent This friar perceuynge him in yt mind
said peace in ye name of god and change thy mind and dye in charity or else
thou shall never come in heaven / na^ (...) yt horsman I will never change ye
mind what so ever shall com^ to my soul this friar perceiving him thus still
contynew his mind can to oconer and said sir in ye name of god have some pity
upon this anannys soul and let him not dye now till he be in a beter mind /
For yf^e dye now he is so far out of cheryte ye utterly his soul shall be
dampened / and showed him what mind he was in and all ye hole matter as is
before showed. This horsman herynge ye friar thus intrete for him said to O^
^oner thus oconer thou see well by this mannys report ye if I dye now I am
out of charity and not ready to go to heaven / and so it is ye I (...) anow out
of charity in deed but thou see well y^ this friar is a good man and he is
now well dysposed and in charity / and he is ready to go to heaven and so am not
I therefore I pray the hang up this friar while y^ he is ready to go to heaven /
and let me tarry till another time yt I may be in charity and ready and mete to go
to heaven This Oconer heryng this mad answer of him spared the man and for gave
him his lyse at that season.

By this ye may se that he that is in danger of his enmye ye has no pite he
can do no beter but show to him ye uttermost of his malycyous mind which that
he beryth to ward him.

THe archdekyn of Essex ye had been long in auctorite in a time of vysytacyon
when all the prestys apperyd before him called aside iii. of the young prestys
which were acusyd that thy could not well say their dyuyne service / and asked
of the^ when they said mas whether they said corpus meus or corpum meu^ The
first pressed said ye hasayd corpus meus. The second said ye he said corpu^
meu^. And than he asked of y^ third how he said / which answered and said
thus / Sir beca^^ is so great a dout and diverse men be in diverse opynyons /
therefore becau^^ would be sure I would not offend when I come to the place I
leave it clen^ out and say nothing therefore / wherefore the bishop than
openly rebuked them all three. But diverse that were present thought more defaut
in hym^^ cause he him self beforetyme had admytted them to be prestys.

By this tale ye mayse that one ought to take heed how he rebukyh an other lest
it torn most to his own rebuke.

Two freres satte at a gentylmans tabyll which had before him on a fast vngday
an ele and cut the head of the ele and laid it upon one o^ the frerys trenchars
/ but the friar because he would have had of the middle part of the ele said to
ye gentylma^ he louyd no ele hedes / this gentylman also cut ye tail of the
ele and laid it on ye other frerys trenchar he like wise because he would have
had of the myddle part of the ele said he loved no ele tails / This
gentylman perceuynge that gave the tail to him that said he louyd not the head
/ and gave the head to him that said he loved not the tail / And as fore ye
myddell part of the ele he ete part him self and part be naue to other folk
at the table / wherefore these freres for anger would ete never a morsel / and
so they for all their craft and subtylte were not only deceived of the best
morsel of the ele / but thereof had no part at all.

By this ye se that they that covet the best part sometime therefore lose the
mean part and all.

A welcheman dwelling in a wild place of walys came to his curate in the time
of lent and was confessyd / and when his confession was in manner at the end
the curate asked him and he had any other thing to say that greuyd his
conscience which fore abasshid a^swered no word a great while / at last by
exhortacyon of his goostly fader he said that there was one thing in his mind
that greatly grieved his conscience which he was asshamed to utter / for it was
so grievous that he trowed god would never forgive him to whom the curate
answered and said that gods mercy was above all / and bad him not dyspayre in
the mercy of god / for what so ever it was if he were repentant that god would
forgive him / And so by long exortacyon at the last he showed it and seyde
thus / Sir it happened ones that as my wife was making a chese upon a friday I
would feign have said whether it had been salt or fresshe and took a little of
the whey in my hand and put it in my mouth and or I was ware part of it
went down my throat against my will and so I brake my fast to whom ye curate
said and if there be non other thing I warant god shall forgive ye / So when
he had well comforted him with the mercy of god the curate prayed him to
answer a quest (...) and to tell him treuth / and when the welchman had
promised to tell the truth ye curate said that there were robberyes and murders
done nigh (...) ^ere he dwelte and diverse men found slain and asked him when thee
(...) ntyage to any of them. to who^ he answered and said yes / and said (...)
ye to many of them and did help to robe and to slay diverse of them (...) urate
asked him why he did not co^ffesse him thereof the welshman answered and sayde^
he took that for no sin for it was a custom amongst them that when any boty
came of any rich merchant rydyng that it was but a good neyboure deed one to
help another when one called another / and so they took that but for good
fellowship and neyghbourhod.

Here may ye se that some have remorse of conscience of small venyall sin is
^fere not to do oret offe^cys without shame of ye worled or dread of god and as
y common prove be is they stumble at a straw and lepe over a block.

A Rich covetous marcha^t there was that dwellid in london which ever gaderyd
money and could never find in his heart to spend ought upon him self nor upon no
man else / which fell sore syke / and as he lay on his death bed had his purs
lyenge at his beddys head / and had such a love to his money that he put his
hand i^ his purs and took out thereof.x. or.xii.ii. in no (...) and put them in
his mouth / And because his wife and other perceived ^^ym very sy^e and like to
dye they exortyd him to be confessyd and brought the ^urate unto him which when
they had caused him to say Benedicite the curate bad him cry god mercy and
show to him his sins Than this seyck man began to sey I crey god mercy I
have offendyd in ye vii. dedly sins and broken the.x. commandments / and
because of the gold in his mouth he muffled so in his speech that the curate
could not well understand him / wherefore the curat asked him what he had in
his mouth that let his spech / I wys may ster person quod the syke man
muffelynge I have nothing in my mouth but a little money because I wot not
whether I shall go I thought I would take some spending money withme for I wot
not what need I shall have thereof And incontinent after that saying dyed before
he was confessyd or repe^tant that any man could perceive / and so by lyklyhod
went to the devil.

By this tale ye may se that they that all their lives will never do charity to
their neghbours / that god in time of their death will not suffer them to have
grace of repentance.

THere was a certain rich husband man in a vyllage which louyd nuttes
meruelously well and set trees of fylberdes and other nutte trees in his
orcharde / and norysshed them well all his life / and when he dyed he made his
executours to make promise to bery with hi^ in his grave a bag of nuttes or
else they should not be his executours / which executours for fere of lesynge of
their comes fulfilled his mind and did so / It happened chat the same night
after that he was beryed there was a mylner in ^^^hyte cote came to this man's
garden to the intent to stele a bag of nuttes and in the way he met with a
tailor in a black cote an unthrift of his (...) yntance and shew^^ him his
intent This tailor like wise showed him that he intendyd the sa^^ time to stele
a sheep / and so they both there agred to go forewarde eue^^ man severally
with his purpose and after ye they anointed to make god (...) re cehe wyt^
other and to mete again in the church porch / and he ye came first to tarry for
^he other / This mylner when he had speed of his nuttys came furst to the
^hyrch porch and there tarried for his fellow and the mean while satte still
there and knakked nuttes. It fortuned than the sexten of ye church because yt
was about.ix. of ye cloak came to ryng curfue and when he lokyd in the porche
and saw one all in white knakkynge nuttes / he had went it had been the deed
man rysyn out of his grave knakkynge the nuttes that were beryed with him and
ran home again in all have and told to a krepyll that was in his house what
he had seen / This crepyll thus herynge him rebuked the sexten and said ye if
he were able to go he would go thither and conjure the spyryte / by my truth
quod the sexten and if thou dare do that I will here the on my neck and so
they both agreee / the sexte^ took ye creple on his nek and ca in to ye
chyrchyarde again and the mylner in ye porch saw one coming beryng a thing on
his neck had went it had been the tailor coming with the sheep and rose up to
mete them / and as he came toward them he asked and said Is he fat / is he fat
/ the sexten heryng him sey so / for fere cast the crepull down and said fat
or lene take him as he is / and ran away / and the creple by miracle was
made hole and ran away as fast as he or faster / This mylner perceyuyng that
they were two and ye one ran after an other thought that one had spyed the
talyer stelyng the sheep and that he had ron after him to have taken him / and
fearyng ye one had spyed him also stelynge ye nuttes he for fear left his
nuttes behynd him and as secretly as he cowde ran home to his myll And anon
after that he was gone the talyer came with the stolen sheep upon his neck to
the church porche to seek the mylner and when he fownd there the nutte shalys
he supposyd that his fellow had been there and gone home as he was in deed
wherefore he took up the sheep again on his neck and went toward the myll But
yet during this while the sexten which ran a way went not to his own house
but went to the parysh prestys chamber / and showed him how the spyryt of the
man was risen out of his grave knackyng nuttes as ye have hard before /
wherefore ye pressed said that he would go coninre him if the sexten would go with
him / and so they both agreed the pressed ^yd on his surples and a stole about
his neck and took holy water with him and ^nn with the sexten toward the
church / and as soon as he entered in the church yard / The talyer with the
white sheep on his neck intendyng as I before have showed you to go down to
the myll met with them and had went (...) it the pressed in his surples had been
ye m^lner in his white cote and said to him by god I have him I have him
mea^yuge by the sheep that he had stolen / the pressed (...) ^ynge the (...) er
all in blake and a white thing on his nek had went (...) ben ye devil beryng
away the spyryte of the deed man that was beryed (...) an away as fast as he
could taking the way down toward the myl^ and (...) erten ronnyng after him
This tailor sey^^ one following him had wet that one had followed the mylner to
have done him some hurt aut thought he would follow if need were to help ye milner
and went forth till he ca^^ to the mill (...) knocked at the myll door / the
mylner being within asked who was there (...) ayler answered and said by god I
have caught one of them and made him sure and tied him fast by ye leggys
menynge by the sheep yt he had stolen and there had on his neck tied fast by
the legs. But the mylner heryng him sey that he had him tied fast by the
legs had went it had been the constable that had taken the tailor for stelyng
^f the sheep and had tied him by ye legs and ferid that he had come to have
taken him also for stelynge of the nuttes / where fore ye mylner opened a bak
door and ran away as fast as he coud. The tailor herynge ye back door opening
went on the other side of the myll and there saw ye mylner ronnyng away and
stood there a little while musyng with the sheep on his neck Then was ye
parysshe priest and the sexte^ standing there under the mylhouse hydyng them
for fere and saw the tailor again with the sheep on his nek had wend still it
had been the devil with the spyryt of the deed man on his nek and for fere ran
away / but because they knew not the^ ground well / the priest lepte into a
dyche almost over the head / like to be drownyde that he cried with a loud
voice help help. Than the tailor lokyd about and saw the mylner run away and
the sexten a another way and hard the priest cry help had went it had been the
constable with a great company cryeng for help to take him and to bring him to
prison for stelyng of ye sheep wherefore he threw down the sheep and ran away
another way as fast as he coud / and so every man was afferd of other without
cause.

By this ye may se well it is folly for any man to fere a thing to (...) noche
till that hese some proof or cause.

IN the old world when all thing coud speak the.iiii. elementys met to geder
for many things which they had to do because they must meddell always one with
a another: and had communicacion to gyder of diverse matters / and by cause they
could not conclude all their matters at that season they appoyntyd to break
co^municacio^ for that time and to mete (...) another time / therefore each one
of them showed to other where their (...) mo^c abydyng was and where their
felows should find them if need should require and first the earth said
brethren ye know well as for me I am permane^r always and not remouable
therefore ye may be sure to have me always whay ye list. The wather said if ye
list to seek me ye shall be sure ever for to have me under a toft of grene
rushes or else in a woman's eye. The wind say if ye list to speak with me ye
shall be sure to have me among aspyn leuys or else in a woman's tongue Then quod ye
fire if any of you ly to seek me / ye shall ever be sure to find me in a flynt
stone or else in a wmans heart

By this tale ye may learn as well the propert of the iiii. elementys as ye

There was a justice but late in ye reame of england called mast Vauesor a very
homely man and rude of co^dycyons and louyd never to spend much money / This

if I should keep any thing from you that ye have papyed for paraduenture ye
would troble me in the law another time.

Here ye may se that he that playth the nygarde to much some time it torneth him
to his own loss.

A Certain weddyd man there was which when he was dede^am what to heaven gates
to saint peter and said he came to claim his badheretage which he had deseruyd
Saint Peter asked him he he was / and he said a weddyd man / anon Saint peter
opened ye gatys and ye him to come in and said he was worthy to have his
heritage because had had much troble and was worthy to have a crown of glory.
And after (...) a another man ye claymyd heaven and said to / Saint Peter he had
^ade.ii. wives to who^ Saint peter answered and said com In for thou art ^orthy
to have a doble crown of glory for thou have had doble troble at ye ^ist there

This tale is a warnyng to them that have been twyse in paryll to be ware how
they come therein the third time.

A Rich merchant of london there was that had one son ye was (...) what
unthrifty therefore his fader upon his death bed called him to him and said he
knew well ye he had been unthrifty how be it if he knew he would amond, his
co^dycyons he would make him his executour and leave him his goods so yt he
would promise him to pray for his soul and to find one daily to sing for him
which thing to perform his son there made a faithful promise / After ye
this man made him his executour and dyed But after ye his son kept such riot
ye in short time he had wasted and spente all and had nothing left but a hen
and a cock that was his faders It fortuned than ye one of his Frendys came to
him and said he was sorry ye he had wasted so much and asked him how he would
proforme his promise made to his fader that he would keep one to sing for him
This yo^gman answered and said by god yet I will perform my promise / for I
will keep this same cock alive still and he will know every day and so he shall
sing every day for my faders soul and so I will perform my promise well enough.

By this ye may se that it is wisdom for a man to do good dedys him self
while he is here and not to trust to the prayer and promise of his executours.

THere was a maid stood by a reuers side in her smoke washing clothes / And

wype his mouth and wenyth ye will come and kiss him.

By this ye may se that woman's answer is never to seek.

AT fortunid there was a great varyance bitwen the bishop of Norwych and one
master Skeleton a poyet lauryat In so much that the bishop commaundyd him that
he should not come in his gatys This master skeleton did absent him self for a
long seson. But at the last he thought to do his dewty to him and studied weys
how he might obtain the bysshopys favor / and determynyd hem self that he
would come to him with some present and humble himself to the bishop and gat a

might come in to speak with my lord. This porter knowing his lordys pleasure
would not suffer him to come in at the gatys wherefore this master skeleton went
on the baksyde to seek some other way to come in to the place. But the place
was motyd that he cowlde se no way to come over except in one place where there
lay a long tree over the motte in manner of a bridge that was fallyn down with
wynd / wherefore this master skeleton went a long upon the tree to come over and
when he was almost over his foot slyppyd for lak of sure fotyng and fell in to
the mote up to myddyll: but at the last he recoueryd him self and as well as he
coud dried him self again / and suddenly came to the bishop being in his hall

to him why thow^aytyfe I warnyd the thou shuldys never come in at my gaty^ and
chargyd my porter to keep the out Forsooth my lord quod skeleton though ye gave
such charge / and though your gatys by never so suerly kept yet yt is no more
possible to keep me out of your dorys tha^ to keep out crows or pyes for I came
not in at your gatys but I came over the mote ye I have be^ almost drownyd for
my labor / and showed his clothys how evil he was arrayed / which caused many
that stood thereby to laughe apace / Than quod Skeleton if it like your lordeshyp

him and asked him what was the cause of his heaviness, which answered that it
was only because his wife was borne domme. To whom this other said I shall
show the sone a remedy and a medecyne (therefore that is thus). Go take an
aspen lefe and lay it under her tongue this night she being a slep^, and I
warante the that she shall speak on the morrow / which man being glad of this
medecyne prepared therefore, and gathered aspen leaves / wherefore he laid three
of them under her tongue when she was a sleep. And on the morrow when he him
self awaked, he pe^^rous to know how his medecyne wrought being in bed
with her, he demanded of her how she did / and suddenly she answered and said,
I beshrowe your heart for wakening me so erly / and so by the virtue of that
medecyne she was restored to her speech: But in conclusyon her speech so
en^^eased day by day, and she was so curste of condycyon that every day she
b^^uled and chydde with her hushande, so much that at the last he was more
^e^ed and had much more trouble and disease with her shrewde words than he
had before when she was dome / wherefore as he walked another time (...) he
happened to meat again with the same person that taught (...) I pray you

^N the time of Lent there came two nonnes to saint Iohn^s in London bycau^^
of the great pardon there to be confessed. Of the which nonnes, the one was a

and confessed her that she had sinned in Lethery. The confessor asked with
whom it was / she said it was with a lustye (...) gallante. He demanded where
it was / she said in a pleasant grene herber, he asked further when it was.
She said in the merry month of May. Than said the confessor this wise / a
fair young lady with a lusty galante, in a pleasant herber and in the merry
month of May ye did but your kind / now by my truth god forgive you and I
do, and so she departed. And incontinent the old nonne met with her, asking
her how she lyked her con (...) / which said he was the best gostly father
that ever she had, and the most easyest in penance geuyng. For comfort
whereof this other nonne went to the same confessor, and shroue her likewise ye
she had sinned in Lechery. And he demanded with whom, which said with an
old friar / he asked where, she said in her old cloister. He asked what
season, she said in Lent. Than the confessor said, and old hoar to lie with
an old friar in her old cloister, and in the holy time of Lent / by cocks
body if god forgive the, yet will I never forgive the. which words caused her
to depart all sad and sore abashed.

By this tale men may learn that a vicyous act is more ab^omynable in one
person than in another, in one season than in another, and in one place than in
an other.

and she said again ye be not wise therein. But he precysely said it should be
so as he bad. And she gentylly again did his commandment. This man yet not

of ye chekyns to him self and gave another to his wife and said thus. Lo I
will have one of the ^hekyns to my part, and thy mother shall have a another,
and because of thy good argument thou shaire have ye third to thy supper, for
thou gettyst no more meat here at this time / which promise the father kept
and so the scoller went without his supper.

By this tale men may se that it is great f^^ly to put one to scole^ learn any
subtle science which has no nature, ^^wytre.

A Friar of London there was that on a sunday in six morning yerly in the
somer season came fro London to Barnette t^ make a co^^cyon / and was there an
hour before hye mass began, and because he would come to the church honestly
/ he went first to an ale house there to wype his shoes and to make him self
clenly. In the which house there were podynges to sell / and diverse folks
there brekynge their fast and eating podynges. But the friar brake his fast
in a secret place in the same house. This friar sone after came to the
church, and by license of the curate entered into the pulpet to make a
colacyon or sermon. And in his sermon there he rebuked sore the manner of them
that used to break their fast on the sunday before hye mass and said it was
called the deuyls black brekefast. And with that word speaking as he did
cast his arms out to make his countenance, there fell a podyng out of his
sleue / which he him self had stolen a little before in the same ale house /
and when the people saw that and specially they that brake their fast there
the same morning and knew well that the wife had complained how she had one
of her podynges stolen / they laughed so much at the friar that he
incontynente went down out of the pulpet for shame.

By this tale a man may se that when a precher does rebuke any sin or vice
wherein he is known openly to ^^egyltie him self / such prechynge shall
little edefye to the people.

A Certain scoler there ^as intending to be made a pre^^, which had another
great (...) nor learning came to the byss^oppe to take orders / whose
folysshenes the bishop perceiving b^^^use he was a rich man's son wold^
not very strongly appose him but asked him this (...) scoler to departed and
came home to his father and showed him the cause of the hynderaunce of his
orders. His father being angry at his folisshenes thought to teache hy^ the
solucyon of this questyon by a famylyer example, and called his ^pan^ess before
him and said thus. Thou know well Colle my dog has these.iii. whelps,
ryg, trygge, and tryboll. Must not all my dogs needs be sire to tryboll.
Than quod the scoler by god father ye said truth let me alone now, ye shall
se my do well enough the next time. wherefore on the mo^^ we he went to the
bishop again and said he could soil his questyon. Than said the
bishop, Noye had three sons, Sem, Came, and Iaphete. Now tell m^ who was
Iaphetes father, mary sir quod the scoler (...) your l^^deshyppe colle my
fathers dog.

(...) tale a man may learn that it is but lost time to teache a (...) thing
which has no wit to perceive it.

IT ^ortuned so that a friar late in the evening desired ^^dgynge of a poor
man of the country, the which for lack of other lodgyng glad to harborowe
the friar lodged him in his own bed. And after he and his wife. The friar
being a sleep came and lay in the same bed. And in the morning after the
poor man rose and went to the market leauyng the friar in the bed with his
wife / And as he wen^e he smyled and laughte to him self. wherefore his
neighbors demanded of him why he so smyled / he answered and said I laughe to
think how shamefaste the friar shall be when he waketh, whom I left in
bed with my wife.

By this tale a man may learn that he that ouershoteth him self does
folysshely, yet he is more fool to show it openly.

Sometime there dwelled a priest in Stretforde upon auyne of small lernyng which
vndeuoutly sange mass, and oftentimes twyse on one day / so it happened on a
time after his second mass was done in short space not a mile from
Stretforde / there met with him diverse merchaunte men which would hau^ hard
mass / and desired him to sing mass and he should hau^ a grote, which
answered them and said. Syrs I will say mass no more th^s day / but I will say
you two gospels for one grote, and that is ^ogge chepe ^ mass in any place in
England.

By this tale a man may se that they that be rude and unlearned regard but
little the merit and goodness of holy prayer.

(...) the friar (...) so drowned and gone, say (...) heart thou should have

By this tale a man may se that (...) and cruel company, shall lose that (...)

A Precher in pulpet which preched the wo^^ (...) matters spoke of men's

IN London there was a certain artifycer having a feyre ^^fe to whom a lusty
galante made pursuit to accomplisshe his pleasure. This woman denyeng showed
the matter unto her husband, which moved there with bad his wife to appoynte
him a time to come secretly to lie with her all night / And with great crakes
and oaths swear, that against his life except coming he would be ready harneysed
and would put him m^a^^pardye of his coming / he would make him a great
amends. This night was them appointed / at which time this courtyer came at
his hour and entered in at the chamber, and set his two handesworde down and
said these words Stand shou there thou sword the death of three men. This
husband lyenge under the bed it hatneys herynge these words lay still for
fere. The courtyer anon gate hin to bed with the wife about this prepensed
business. And within an hour (...) two the husband being weary of lyenge
began to remove him. The courtyer that hearing asked the wife what thing
that as that removed under the bed, which excusing the matter said it was
a^^^tell sheep ye (...) ^^ont^ daily to go about ye house. And the husband
that herynge a (...) ^^^yed ble a^ it had been a sheep. And so in conclusyon
when the courtyer (...) his tym^ he rose and kyssed the wife and took his leave
and departed. (...) sone as h^ was gone the husband arose, and when the wife
looked on and somewhat ^basshed began to make as^^d countenance and said / alas
sir why did (...) (...)

(...) the is not wise that will put his con^^dence (...) crakers which often
times will do but ly^ (...) point.

(...) in his shope that saw a colyer come by, (...) because he was so black
/ and asked him what (...) and how the devil fared. To whom the (...) when I
saw him last / for he was riding (...) souter to pluck on his botes.

(...) may se that he that uses to deryde other folks, is sometime (...) more
deryded and mocked.

I Find (...) ^monge old gestes how god made saint Peter porter of (...)
that god of his goodness sone after his passion suffered (...) men to come to
the kingdom of heaven with small deseruynge, at (...) time (...) was in heaven a
great company of welchemen, which with their (...) babelynge troubled all the
other. wherefore god said to saint Peter (...) the was weary of them, and that
he would feign have them out of heaven To whom saint Peter said, Good lord I
warrente you that shall be shortly done / wherefore saint Peter went out of heaven
gates and cried which a loud voice, Cause bobe. That is as much to say, as
roasted these / which thing the welchemen herynge ran out of heaven a great
pace. And w^an saint Peter saw them all out he suddenly went into heaven and
locked the door and so sparred all the welchemen out.

By this y^ may se that it is no wysdo^^ or a man to love or to set his mind
to much upon any delycate or worldely pleasure whereby he shall lose the
celestyall and eternal joy.

Two knights there were which went to a standing fylde with their prince /
but one of them was confessed before he went / but the other went into the
fell^ without shryfte or repentance. Afterward this ^ryme (...) the fylde
^had the victory that day / wherefore he that was con^^ssed came ^o the prince
and asked an office and said that he had deserved it, ^r he ^ad d^ne good
service and adventured that day as ^arre ^s any man in ^e field to whom the
other that was unconfessed answer^^ and said. Nay the mass I am more worthy to
have a reward than he / for he adventured (...) his body for your sake, for he
durst not go to the field till he was confessed / (...) he had left few or

By this ye may se that they be (...) devotion to prayer and ve^tew.

Upon a time certain women in the country were (...) and mokke a friar a

ran after the friar and cried com again maeste^ (...) come again and let it

By this ye may se that they that use to deride and mok other (...) time it
tornyth to their own loss and damage.

A Certain pressed there was that dwelled in the cu^try which was (...) very well

IN a certain town there was a rych man that lay on his death bed at point of
death which chargyd his executours to dele for his soul a certain some of
money in pence and on this condition that gyd them as they would answer before
God that every poor man that came to them and told a true tale should have a

there came one which said that god was a good man / quod the executors thou

(...) and said / shall I bring my children with me also. The byssh^^^ (...)
this said in sport, vxor tua sicut vitis abundans in lateribu^ (...) The
priest than half amasyd answered and said. Filij tui sicut (...) rum in
circuitu mense tue.

By this ye may se that they that have but small lernyng sometime speak truly
unadvised.

ON asshe wednysday in the morning was a curate of a church which, had made
good chere the night before and sytten up late / and came to the church to here
confession, to whom there came a woman / and among other things she confessed
her that she had stolen a pot. But than because of great watch that this
priest had, he there suddenly fell a sleep. And when this woman saw him not
willing to here her, she rose and went her way. And anon an other woman
kneled down to the same priest and began to say Benedicite / wherewith this
priest suddenly awaked wenynge she had been ye other woman and said all angerly /
what art thou now at Benedicite again, tell me what dyddest thou when thou
had stolyn the pot.

SOne after one master whyttington had bylded a colege on a night as he slepte
he dremed that he satte in his church and many folks there also / And further
he dremed ye he saw our lady in ye same church with a glass of goodly
oyntemente in her hand going to one asking him what he had done for ^^^^ke,
which said that he had said our ladies sauter every day / wherefore she gave
him a little of the oil. And anon she went to another, (...) college and was

(...) this ye may se that many a fool does much cost in making (...)

Certain of vycars of Poules disposed to be merry on a sunday at hye mass
time, sent another mad fellow of their acquointaunce unto a folysshe dronken
priest to give him a bottell / which man met with the priest upon the top of
the stayres by the chauncell door and spoke to him and said thus. Sir my
master has sent you a bottell to put your drink in because he can keep
none in your brains. This priest therewith being very angry / all suddenly
took the bottell and with his foot flange it down into the body of the church
upon the gentylmens head.

A Certain Jury in the countye of Myddelsex was enpaneld for the king to
^nquere of all endytementes, murders, and felony^s. The persons of this panell
were folysshe covetous and unlearned / for who so ever would give them a grote,

proof or euydence / wherefore one that was (...) ^yn as was (...) which byll

By this ye may se it is great parell to (...) equest which be folysshe and

IN a certain parrysshe a friar preched / and (...) that rode on the sunday,

(...) whom the friar suddenly answered and said thus. But (...) thereof, was he

THere was a certain man that had two sons (...) For the eldyst was lustye

roseerly and walked into the fyldes, and there by fortune he found a (...) and
(...) it home to his father. His father when he had it went (...) to his (...)
yet lyenge than in his bed, and said to him. O thou sloga^^ quod he, seyst thou
not thine eldest brother how he by his erly rysynge had found a purse with
money, whereby we shall be greatly helped all our life / while thou slugging
in thy bed do thou no good but sleep. He than wist not what to say, but
answered shortly and said / father quod he if he that has lost the purse and
money had line in his bed that same time that he lost it as I do now, my
brother had found no purse nor money to day.

By this ye may se that they that be accustomed in vice and sin will always
find one excuse or other to cloak therewith their vice and vnthryfty^s.

A Certain wife there was which was somewhat fair and as all women be that be
fair was somewhat proud of her beautye / and as she and her maid satte
together she as one that was desirous to be praised said to her thus. I faith
Ione how thynkest thou / am I not a fair wife / yes by my troth maistres
quod she, ye be the fairest that ever was except (...) place, which lord

which John^ would feign (...) maystres, not for no great pleasure, but only

laid him in his masters bed as she was wont to lay the pycture. This
wydowe was wont every night before she slepte and diverse times when she waked
to kiss the said pycture of old John^. wherefore the said night she kyssed
the said young man, beleuynge that she had kyste the pycture. And he suddenly
starte and took her in his arms, and so well pleased her than / that old
John^ from thens forth was clean out of her mind, and was content that this
young John^ should lie with her still all that night / and that the pycture of
old John^ should lie still under the bed for a thing of naught. After this
in the morning this wydowe intending to please this young John^ which had
made her so good pastyme all the night, bad her maid go dress some good mete
for their brekefast to feast therewith her young John^. This maid when she had
long sought for wode to dress ye said mete, told her maystres ye she could
