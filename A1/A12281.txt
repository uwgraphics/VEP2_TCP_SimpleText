Here begins a little treatise named the bowge of court.

IN Autumpne when the son in vyrgyne
By radyante hete enryped has our corn
When luna full of mutabylyte
As Emperes the dyademe has worn
Of our pole artyke smiling half in scorn
At our folly and our unsteadfastness
The time when Mars to werre him did dies
I calling to mind the great auctoryte
Of poets old which full craftily
Under as couerte terms as could be
Can touch a troughte and cloak it subtylly
With fresshe vtteraunce full sentencyously
Diverse in style some spared not vice to wrythe
Some of mortalyte nobly did endyte
Whereby I read their renome and their fame
May never dye bute evermore endure
I was sore moved to a force the same
But Ignorance full soon did me dysture
And showed that in this art was not sure
For to Illumyne she said I was to dulle
Auysynge me my pen away to pulle
And not to wrythe / for he so will atteyne
Exceeding ferther than his conning is
His head may be hard but feeble is his brain
Yet have I known such er this
But of reproach surely he may not mys
That clymmeth hyer than he may fotynge have
What and he slide down who shall him save
Thus up and down my mind was drawn and cast
That I ne wyste what to do was best
So sore enwered that I was at the last
Enforsed to sleep and for to take some rest
And to lie down as soon as I my dreste
At harwyche port slumbrynge as I lay
In mine hosts house called powers keye
Me thought I saw a ship goodly of sail
Come saylynge forth in to that haven brood
Her takelynge rich and of hye apparayle
She kyste an anchor and there she lay at rode
Merchants her borded to see what she had lode
There in they found Royal marchaundyse
Fraghted with pleasure of what ye con^e deuyse
But than I thought I would not dwell behind
Among all other I put my self in prece
Than there could I none aquentaunce find
There was much noise anon one cried cese
Sharply co^maundynge each man hold his piece
Masters he said the ship that ye here see
The bowge of court it hyghte for cert^ynet
The awnner thereof is lady of estate
Whoos name to tell is dame saunce pere
Here marchaundyse is rich and fortunate
But who will have it must pay therefore dear
This Royal chaffre that is shypped here
Is called fauore to stand in her good grace
Than should ye see there pressynge in a pace
Of one and other that would this lady see
Which sat behind a tranes of sylke fine
Of gold of tessew the fynest that might be
In a trone which fer clerer did shine
Than Phoebus in his spear celestyne
Whoos beauty honor goodly port
I have to little conning to report
But of each thing there as I took head
Among all other was written in her trone
In gold letters this word which I did read
Garder le fortune que est mauelz et bone
And as I stood redynge this verse my self allone
Her chyef gentylwoman danger by her name
Gave me ataunte and said I was to blame
To be so perte to prese so proudly up
She said she trowed that I eten sause
She asked if ever I drank of saucys cup
And I than softly answered to that clause
That so to say. I had given her no cause
Than asked she me Sir so god the speed
What is thy name and I said it was dread
What mouyd the quod she hydder to come
Forloth quod I to bye some of your ware
And with that word on me she gave a glome
With brows bente and began on me to stare
Full daynnously and fro me she did fare
Leuynge me stondynge as a mased man
To whom there came an other gentylwoman
Desire her name was and so she me told
Saying to me brother be of good chere
Abasshe you not but hardely be bold
Auaunce your self to aproche and come nere
What though our chaffer be never so dear
Yet I auyse you to speak for any dread
Who spares to speak in faith he spares to speed
maystres quod I. I have none aquentaunce
That will for me be medyatoure and mean
And this an other I have but small substance
Piece quod Desire ye speak not worth a been
If ye have not in faith I will you lene
A precious Jewel no rycher in this land
Bone adventure have here now in your hand
Shyfte now therewith let see as ye can
In bowge of court cheuysaunce to make
For I dare say that there nys erthly man
But an he can bone adventure take
There can no favor nor frendshyp him forsake
Bone adventure may bring you in such case
That ye shall stand in favor and in grace
But of one thing I werne you er I goo
She that styreth the ship make her your friend
Maystres quod I. I pray you tell me why so
And how I may that way and means find
Forsothe quod she how ever blow the wind
Fortune gydeth and rules all our ship
Whom she hates shall over the sea boorde skyp
Whom she loves of all plesyre is rich
Whiles she laughed and has lust for to play
Whom she hateh she casts in the dyche
For when she fron^eth she thy^keth to make a fray
She cherysshed him and him she casseth a way
Alas quod I how might I have her sure
In faith quod she by bone adventure
Thus in a row of martchauntes a great route
Suwed to fortune that she would be their frynde
They thronge in fast and flocked her about
And I with them prayed her to have in mind
She promised to us all she would be kind
Of bowge of court she asks what we would have
And we asked favor / and favor she us gave
Thus ends the prologue. And begins the bowge of Court breuely compyled.
Dread THe sail is up fortune rules our helm
We want no wind to pass now over all
Favor we have toughther than any elm
That will abide and never from us fall
But under honey often time lies bitter gall
For as me thought in our ship I did see
Full subtle persons in nombre four and three
The first was Fauell full of flatery
With fables false that well could feign a tale
The second was Suspecte which that daily
Mysdempte each man with face deedly and pale
And Haruy haster that well could pick a male
With other four of their affynyte
Dysdayne. Ryotte. Dyssymuler. Subtylte.
Fortune their friend with whom often she did dau^ce
They could not fail they thought they were so sure
And oftentimes I would my self anaunce
With them to make solace and pleasure
But my dysporte they could not well endure
They said they hated for to dele with Dread
Than Fauell began with fair speech me to feed

Fauell. No thing erthely that I wonder so sore
As of your conning that is so excellent
Deynte to have with us such one in store
So virtuously that has his days spente
Fortune to you gifts of grace has lent
Loo what it is a man to have conning
All erthly tresoure it is surmountynge
Ye be an apt man as any can be found
To dwell with us and serve my ladies grace
Ye be to her ye a worth a thousand pound
I herd her speak of you within short space
When there were diverse yt sore did you manace
And though I say it I was my self your friend
For here be diverse to you that be unkind
But this one thing ye may be sure of me
For by that lord that bought dear all mankind
I can not flater I must be plain to the
And ye need ought man show to me your mind
For ye have me whom faithful ye shall find
Whiles I have ought by god thou shall not lack
And if need be a bold word I dare crack
Nay nay be sure whiles I am on your side
Ye may not fall trust me ye may not fail
Ye stand in favor and fortune is your gyde
And as she will so shall our great ship sail
These lewd cok watt shall neuermore prevail
Ageynste you hardely therefore be not afraid
Fare well till soon but no word that I said

Dread. Than thanked I him for his great gentylnes
But as me thought he ware on him a cloak
That lyned was with doubtful doublenes
Me thought of words that he had full a poke
His stomak stuffed often times did reboke
Suspycyon me thought met him at a brayde
And I drew nere to herke what they two said
In faith quoth suspecte) spoke dread no word of me
Why what than will thou let men to speak
He says he can not well accord with the
Twyst quoth suspecte) goo play him I ne reke
By christ quoth fauell dread is soleyne freke
What let us hold him up man for a while
Ye so quoth suspecte) he may us both begyle
And when he came walking soberly
With whom / and / ha / and with a crooked look
Me thought his head was full of gelousy
His eyes rollynge his hondes fast they quoke
And to me ward the strayte way he took
God speed brother to me quod he than
And thus to talk with me he began

Suspycyon Ye remember the gentylman right now
That command with you me thought a party spoke
Beware of him for I make god auowe
He will begyle you and speak fair to your face
Ye never dwelte in such an other place
For here is none that dare well other trust
But I would tell you a thing and I durst
Spoke he a faith no word to you of me
I wot and he did ye would me tell
I have a favor to you whereof it be
That I must show you much of my cou^selle
But I wonder what the devil of hell
He said of me when he with you did talk
By mine auyse use not with him to walk
The soueraynst thing that any man may have
Is little to say / and much to here and see
For but I trusted you so god me save
I would no thing so plain be
To you oonly me think I durst shryue me
For now am I plenarely dysposed
To show you things that may not be disclosed

Dread Than I assured him my fydelyte
His counseyle secret never to dysture
If he could find in heart to trust me
Else I prayed him with all my besy cure
To keep it himself for than he might be sure
That no wan erthly could him bewreye
Whiles of his mind it were lockte with the keye
By god quod he this and thus it is
And of his mind he showed me all and some
Fare well quod hew will talk more of this
So he departed there he would be come
I dare not speak I promised to be dome
But as I stood musing in my mind
Haruy haster came lepynge light as lynde
Upon his breast he bare a versynge box
His throat was clear and lustely could feign
My thought his gown was all furred with fox
And ever he sange / sithe I am no thing plain
To keep him from pykynge it was a great pain
He gased on me with his gotyshe berde
When I looked on him my purse was half aferde

Heruy haster. Sir god you save why look ye so sad
What thing is that I may do for you
A wonder thing that ye wax not mad
For and I study should as ye do now
My wit would waste I make god auowe
Tell me your mind me think ye make a verse
I could it stan and ye would it rehearse
But to the point shortly to proceed
Where has your dwelling ben er ye came here
For as I trow I have seen you in deed
Er this when that ye made me Royal chere
Hold up the helm look up and let god stere
I would be merry what wind that ever blow
Heue and how rombelow row ye bote norman row
Princes of youghte can ye sing by rote
Or shall I sail with you a felashyp assaye
For on the book can not sing a note
Would to god it would please you some day
A balade book before me for to lay
And learn me to sing (Re my fa sol)
And when I fail bobbe me on the ^oll
Loo what is to you a pleasure great
To have that conning and ways that ye have
By goddis soul I wonder how ye get
So great pleasyre or who to you it gave
Sir pardone me I am an homely knave
To be with you thus perte and thus bold
But ye be welcome to our household
And I dare say there is no man here Inn
But would be glad of your company
I wyste never man that so soon could win The favor that ye have with my lady
I pray to god that it may never die
It is your fortune for to have that grace
As I be saved it is a wonder case
For as for me I served here many a day
And yet uneath I can have my living
But I require you no word that I say
For and I know any erthly thing
That is again you ye shall have wetynge
And ye be welcome sir so god me save
I hope here after a friend of you to have

Dread. With that as he departed so fro me
Anon there met with him as me thought
A man / but wonderly besene was he
He looked hawte he set each man at naught
His gaudy garment with storunys was all wrought
With Indygnacyon lyned was his hode
He frowned as he would swear by cocks blood
He bote the lyppe he looked passing coye
His face was belymmed as byes had him stou^ge
It was no time with him to Iape nor toye
Envy has wasted his liver and his lou^ge
Hatred by the heart so had him wrounge
That he looked pale as ashes to my syghte
Dysdayne I wene his comerous carbes hyghte
To heruy haster than he spoke of me
And I drew nere to hark what they two said
Now quod Dysdayne as I shall saved be
I have great scorn and amryghce evil apayed
Than quod Heruy why art thou so dysmayde
By christ quod he for it is shame to say
To see Johan dawes that came but yester day
How he is now taken in conceyte
This doctor dawcocke Dread I wene he hyghte
By goddis bones but if we have some sleyte
It is like he will stand in our light
By god quod Heruy and it so happen might
Let us therefore shortly at a word
Find some mean to cast him over the board
By him that me boughte than quoth Dysdayne
I wonder sore he is in such conceyte
Turde quoth Haster I will the no thing said
There must for him be laid some pretty beyte
We tweyne I trow be not without dysceyte
First pycke a quarrel and fall out with him then
And so outface him with a card of ten
Forthwith he made on me a proud assawte
With scornful look meuyd all in mood
He went about to take me in a fawte
He frou^de he stared he stampped where he stood
I looked on him I wend he had be wood
He set the arm proudly under the side
And in this wise he began with me to chyde

Disdain. Remembrest thou what thou said yester night
Wylt thou abide by the words again
By god I have of the now great dyspyte
I shall the anger ones in every vain
It is great scorn to see such an hayne
As thou art one that came but yesterdaye
With us old servants such masters to play
I tell the I am of countenance
What weneste I were. I trow you know not me
By goddis wounds but for dysplesaunce
Of my querell soon would I venged be
But no force I shall ones mete with the
Come when it will oppose the I shall
What someuer adventure thereof fall
Trowest thou dreuyll I say thou gaudy knane
That I have deynte to see the cherysshed thus
By goddis side my sword thy berde shall shave
Well ones thou shalt be chermed I wus
Nay straw for tales thou shalt not rule us
We be thy betters and so thou shalt us take
Or we shall the out of thy clothes shake

Dread. With that came Ryotte russhynge all at ones
A rusty gallande to ragged and to rent
And on the board he whyrled a pair of bones
Quater treye dews he clatered as he went
Now have at all by saint Thomas of kente
And ever he threw and kyst I wot nere what
His here was grown through out his hat
Then I beheld how he dysgysed was
His head was heavy for watchynge over night
His eyes blereed his face shone like a glass
His gown so short that it ne cover might
His rumpe he went so all for somer light
His hose was guarded with a list of grene
Yet at the knee they were broken I wene
His cote was checked with patches read and blewe
Of kyrkeby kendall was his short demye
And ay he sange in faith decon thou crewe
His elbowe bare he ware his gere so nigh
His nose a droppynge his lyppes were full dry
And by his side his whynarde and his pouche
The devil might dau^ce therein for any crowche
Counter he could (Olux) upon a pot
An ^estryche fedder of a capons tail
He set up fresshely upon his hat a lofte
What revel route quod he and began to rail
How often he had hit Ienet on the tail
Of felyce fetewse dnd little pretty cate
How often he knocked at her klycked gate
What should I tell more of his rebaudrye
I was ashamed so to here him prate
He had no pleasure but in harlotrye
Ay quod he in the deuylles date
What art thou I saw the now but late
Forsothe quod I in this court I dwell now
Welcome quod Ryote I make god auwe

Ryote. And sir in faith why comste not us among
To make the merry as other fellows done
Thou must swear and stare man aldaye long
And wake all night and sleep till it be none
Thou may not study or muse on the moon
This world is no thing but ete drink and sleep
And thus with us good company to keep
Pluck up thine heart upon a merry pyne
And let us laugh a placke or tweyne at nale
What the devil man myrthe was never one
What loo man see here of dyce a bale
A brydelynge cast for that is in thy male
Now have at all that lies upon the burde
Fie on this dyce they be not worth a turde
Have at the hasarde or at the dosen brown
Or else I pas a penny to a pound
Now would to god thou would leye money down
Lord how that I would cast it full round
Ay in my pouche a buckell I have found
The arms of calyce I have no coin nor cross
I am not happy I run ay on the loss
Now run must I to the stewys side
To wete if malkyn my lem^an have get ought
I let her to hyre that men may on her ride
Her harms easy far and nere is sought
By goddis sides syns I her thither brought
She has got me more money with her tail
Than has some ship that in to bordews sail
Had I as good an horse as she is a mare
I durst adventure to Journey thorugh France
Who rydeth on her he needs not to care
For she is trussed for to break a lance
It is a curtet that well can wynche and praunce
To her will I now all my pouerte lege
And till I come have here is mine hat to plege

Dread Gone is this knave this rybaude foul and leude
He ran as fast as ever that he might
Vnthryftnes in him may well be showed
For home tyborne groneth both day and night
And as I stood and kyste aside my syghte
Dysdayne I saw with Dyssymulacyon
Standing in sad communicacion
But there was poyntynge and noddynge with y^ head
And many words said in secret wise
They wandered ay and stood still in no stead
Me thought always Dyscymular did deuyse
Me passing sore mine heart than began arise
I dempte and dread their talking was not good
Anon dyscymular came where I stood
Than in his hode I saw there faces tweyne
That one was lene and like a pyned ghost
That other looked as he would me have slain
And to mewarde as he began for to coost
When that he was even at me almoost
I saw a knyfe hyd in his one sleue
Whereon was written this word myscheue
And in his other sleue me thought I saw
A spone of gold full of honey sweet
To feed a fool and for to preye a dawe
And on that sleue these words were wrete
A false abstracte comes from a falls concrete
His hode was side his cope was roset graye
These were the words he to me did say

Dyssymulatioy / How do ye master ye look so soberly
As I be saved at the dredefull day
It is a perylous vice this envy
Alas a conning man ne dwell may
In no place well but foles with fraye
But as for that connyge has no foo
Save him that naught can / scripture says so.
I know your versu and your lytterkture
By that little conning that I have
Ye be malygned sore I you ensure
But ye have craft your self always to save
It is great scorn to se a mysproude knave
With a clerk that conning is to prate
Let them go lowse them in the deuylles date
For all be it that this long not to me
Yet on my back I bear such lewd delynge
Right now I spoke with one I trow I see
But what a straw I may not tell all thing
By god I say there is great heart brennynge
Between the person ye wot of Iou
Alas I could not dele so with a yew
I would each man were as plain as I
It is a world I say te here of some
I hate this faynynge fie upon it fie
A man can not wot where to become
I wys I could tell but humlery home
I dare not speak we be so laid awayte
For all our court is full of dysceyte
Now by saint frau^ceys that holy man and friar
I hate this ways again you that they take
Were I as you I would ride them full nere
And by my truth but if an end they make
Yet will I say some words for your sake
That shall them anger I hold there on a grote
For some shall wene be hanged by the throat
I have a stoppynge oyster in my poke
Trust me and if it come to a need
But I am loathe for to reyse a smoke
If ye could be otherwise agrede
And so I would it were so god me speed
For this may bread to a confusyon
Without god make a good conclusyon
Nay see where yonder stondeth the teder man
A flaterynge knave and false he is god wot
The dreuyll stondeth to harken and he can
It were more thryft he boughte him a new cote
It will not be / his purse is not on flote
All that he wereth it is borrowed ware
His wit is thynne his hode is threde bare
More could I say but what this is ynowe
A dew till soon we shall speak more of this
Ye must be ruled as I shall tell you how
Amendis may be of that is now a mys
And I am your sir so have I blys
In every point that I can do or say
Give me your hand fare well and have good day

Dread Suddenly as he departed me fro
Came pressynge in one in a wonder array
Er I was ware behind me he said bo
Then I astonyed of that sodeyne fraye
Sterte all at once I lyked no thing his play
For if I had not quyckely fled the touch
He had plucte out the nobles of my pouche
He was trussed in a garmente strayte
I have not seen such an others page
For he could well upon a casket wait
His hode all pounsed and guarded like a cage
Light lyme finger he took none other wage
Harken quod he loo here mine hand in thine
To us welcome thou art by saint Quyntyne

Disceyte. But by that lord that is one two and three
I have an errande to round in your ere
He told me so by god ye may trust me
Part remember when ye were there
There I wynked on you / wot ye not where
In (A) loco I mean iuxta (B)
Woo is him that is blind and may not see
But to here the subtylte and the craft
As I shall tell you if ye will hark again
And when I saw the horsons would you hafte
To hold mine hand by god I had great pain
For forth with there I had him slain
But that I drde mordre would come out
Who deleth with shrewes has need to look about

Dread. And as he roynded thus in mine ere
Of false collusyon confetryd by assente
Me thought I see lewd felawes here and there
Came for to slay me of mortal entente
And as they came the shypborde fast I hente
And thought to lepe / and even with that woke
Caughte pen and ynke and wroth this little book
I would therewith no man were myscontente
Besechynge you that shall it see or read
In every point to be indyfferente
Sith all in substance of slu^brynge does proceed
I will not say it is matter in deed
But yet oftyme such dremes be found true
Now constrewe ye what is the resydewe

Thus ends the Bowge of court.
Enprynted at westmynster By me Wynkyn the word.
