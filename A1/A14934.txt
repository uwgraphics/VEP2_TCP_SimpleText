THE PROHEME
Bearand the origin of the Sea law, the ground of this treaty and the
occasions theroff.
THe daily traffike on the sea constrainit the Rhodians of auld to dytte lawis
in the Mediterrane Sea / and not very lang since the Olonois to set forth their
lawis in the Ocean. Quhilks lawis / the singular skill of both peiple sa
commendit and equity sa approuit / that not only hes the Rhodian law be a
special ordinance ( l libellus 8* ad l rhod.
) bin embraced throghout the Roman dominion / and sicklike / a great part of
the reulis of Olon fellowit in our quarter of the Ocean: bot are also both
receauit in the may part of the quarter foresaid / at lest / sa far as they
are commonly knawin be peiple. Quhilk knawledge because I haife commonly found
to be very little in this cuntry / notwithstanding that all men be bound to ken
the law / l leges C de legib.
namely their own common law / bart in l non fatetur nu: 6 and 12. de confess.
gloss. in l liberorum verb. non juris de his qui not. infam.
notwithstanding also the worthiness and daily neide thairof / in this great
incresse of traffic quhilke ruin of auld was ay haulden to tend till a great
Commonwealth. l ^ licet verse quia ad summam de excercit.
Therfoir a 13. yeirs since / out of all the wrets authorizit be our nation I
collectit briefly* not only the remains of the Rhodian law / as it is left
interpret to us be the Roman lawers / with the reulis of Olon rcceauit be our
country men / bot also the acts of parliament / with vthers rests of the Romain
law concernand the Seafairing. And hes now / I trow / in a conueuient time at
the earnest desire of sundry orderly digest / and publishir the samin / for
the reddier usage to all Scafairing men / luking verily for good occasion at
their hands of farther travel in this turn afterward / as God the great

TIT. 1. The sum and ordour of this Treaty.
AS the turns of the Sea concerns only seasayring men / and mellairis with
them: evinsa al doubts differences / and actions / rising vpoun the samyn /
and their chances mann also concern the samyn persouns quhilks ar ather
chiefly Awners / Outredders / Masters / Pilots / Mariners / Merchands /
Passingers. Of quhome the awner is he to quhome the Schip / or any part
thairof belangis at the lest in propriety. And the outredder he to quhom ather
as dealisman for a veiage / or a certain time during the setting of the Schip
/ the proffitis and commodities thairof chiefly redounds l ^. in pr. de excer.
as the master he to quhome the cure of the hail Schip is committed. d l 1. 1.
The rest are knawin. Quhilks personages quhilis hapnis for a great part in
ane: as an man to be awner / outredder / master / and steirsman: And another
to be both Merchant and Mariner in passing a field / and in returning
perchance bot a passinger: Quhilis again for common / all and ilke ane of their
persons to be diverse and of ilk sort ma / as ma awners / ma outredders / etc.
And thairfoir the actions also not to be indifferently common / aither / for or
against ilk ane of their persons / but only according to the personage
sustcined. And sick like ye deciding of the samin actions and debates / not to
pertein to ilk Judge and place / but quhylis to the great Judge of the Sea
only / quha is Admiral / and quhylis to the Deanes of Gild also / not without
soume entres in soume things to other judges and persons according to the
provision of law / and use of the land. Of quhilks things summarly / bot
orderly this abridgement sall make shawe. Beginning at the fraughting of schips
/ as a thing concerning the chief use and end of schipping / syn the persons

the manner of judgment thairin. And last of the judges ordinair to all Seafair
debaits and causes.

TIT. 2. Offraughting of Schips.
NA Schip should be fraughtit without ane charterparty / beirand that the master
sall provide an sufficient steirseman / timberman / and schipmen convenient for
the schip / with fire water and salt on his awin cost / and gif any debate sall
happen betwixt the master and merchant they sall underly the iurisdictioun of
the brough quhairvnto the ship is fraughtit / without any exemption and that na
drink silver be taken fra the merchandis under the pain of the tinsell of the
fraught and ane tons fraught to the kirk warke of the town to the quhilk they
are fraughted. c. 17 et 130 actor lacob 3
Gif a schip be nocht reddy at the day appointed in the charterparty to go to
the Sea / the merchant may not only quyte himself of her / per L. item 23 Si

except he had his peace and discharge her not at the day / for then he
appearis again be silence to consent again of new. d^ item sin
Bot also obtein all costs / skaiths and interest / c 16 olon
except the master schaw sum excuse of a notorious necessity / or of a chance
quhilk could nocht ben eschewed / and than he lossis only his fraught / because
he hes not seruit thairfoir. per l ex conducto in pr, l Si item fundus l. et
aec distinctio et l. si in lege, colonus, locat.
Bot gif the fault be in the merchant / he sall pay the skipper and schips
skaith / d* l* ex conducto item quum quidam.
and in case the merchant hald not out his v^yage / he sal pay the hail
fraught: l. pen tamen loc. facit d* l. si in lege l si domus et l. domus ho^.

Giffe in the voyage the schip without the masters fault / becums through
storms unable / or that the master and schip be arreistit be ane magistrate
in the way / the master may aither fraught ane other schip / or bett his
own: Or in case the merchaunt will not agree thairto / the master sall haif
fraught so far as he hes seruit: c 4. et 18 olon l vlt 1 ad ^^hod.

puttis the gudis in ane worse schip / and schip and guds perish the master sal
be haldin for all / except that both the schips perish that voyage / and that
na guile nor fault be found with the master. d l vl ^ ad l. rhod
Now it is recomptit for a fault in this case / gif the schip be put out to the
Sea / aither without a skillful Pilot / or in a incommodious time / or that the
schip be unworthy her self / in quhilk the gear is put in / d l item 1 et 2
as vntight / or without sufficient gear. Gif a skipper without leiue of his
merchant take in mair / nor he set his schippe forth for / he sall loose the
fraught thairof. c ^3. olon.
Ane schip portand at ane other port / nor she was fraughtit too and against
the masters will / (quhilk he sall with two mariners declair vpoun their
aiths) the guds sall be fuirit to the port / conditionit on the skippers cost.

schipwrack c 3 eod
The duty of the master is / befoir he lowse his schip out of the Harbery /

lichter and gear put thairin only to be saif / na contributioun sall be set
upon the gear in the boat / bot it sal freely apperteine to the awners thairof

This also is to be markit / that giff of ane fort of gear / as Salt / Corn /

chance to receive the samin / and the partners may naither do against the
Master / nor him quha receauis it / for any part thairof / t l in nauem 31 loc.

master to retain all the guds on his schippes boddome / or at lest in his
