THE FUNERAL OF THE NETHERLANDS PEACE.

And shortly must in grave be laid? (ne
These Bells of Hell shall make it known
With thundering noise: it shall be said
And certified, that NETHERLAND
Her 12 years TRUCE has laid in sand.

Her life she lost in April last,
Her Burial now must be made known
To all her Friends, that they in have
May come with grief, and groan to see,
This trusty friend thus buried be.
It Is meet she should in solemn sort
Have them to grace her funeral,
Who have experience (by report)
Of much good service done them all:
For hearts and hands she held in bands
Off people free in Netherlands.

Her goods, her lands* that them the gave
By Testament, as it is enrolld,
These must attend about the grave.
We place them there, because most right
They have, to grieve to see this sight.
Let them approach with hatts in hand,
And with their Tears their faces stayne,
Gnashing their teeth, and wayling stand.
Til all be done, let them remain
Lamenting such a friends as this,
That all to soon departed is.

Let them go next unto the Corse,
That we a fitting time may find,
In grave to thrust them both perforce,
Whilst for their Mother there they cry
With her in grave they both may lie.
So with the mother these two Babes,
Bad trading and Civill-discord,
May end their days; and we our trades
Regayne and lovingly accord:
Which once obtained may never cease,
Till it has crouwnid the land with peace.

With hooked Miters on your Crowns,
With sheepheards crookes and costly gowns,
Which pluck the ^^^ec^ and starve poor clowns
Come bear a par^e, now mourn you must,
To see your Patron laid in dust.

Keep home and link within your cells,
Lea^^ soldiers fall upon your bones:
But first bring banners, beads and bells,
With all the tricks you can devise
This funeral to solempu^se

And other times processions hold,
With Saints on shoulders, now come weep
You may no longer be so bold.
Such saints, will soldiers hold impure
Such holy works they will not endure,

That border on the Guyse towns near
Tread on: for each of you and us
Hence forth by force our arms must bear,
For fear of those that steal and catch
We day and night must keep good watch.

That daily trudge through thick and thynne
Whey, butter, cheese, and milk to sell,
Good liquor for your gutts to win,
That swallowe down stealinge th'impost,
Of wine and beer which ye drink most.
The vittailes which your selves should ca^e
For hungry soldiers shall be meat:
What you have sown others shall reap,
Both goods and gilt earnd by your sweat:
Bring TRUCE to grave, to Cities creep
Where you from wars may safely keep.

Come help to lay her under ground;
Her death bewail with mournful notes,
That was your best protector found,
In keeping those from you away
Which feign would have your Mantels graye.

That halting beg, yet sound can steal,
Prepare your selves, now be foretold
To pack out of this Common weal:
For Mars his men will hang the rout
That want a pass, yet walk about.
But ere you go TRUCE does require,
That with your presence you her grace:
It else would make men much admire,
When see they should your empty place:
Your order keep least men forgett,
Where all the comers should be set.
All ye whom it concerns most,
By mourning make your love appear:
So shall her friends have cause to boast,
That many such have loved her dear,
And you again shall be beloved
As friends should be that are approved.

The hidden secretts of the Mass,
Therefore is set upon the grave,
Wherefore the TRUCE ordained was:
Engraven it is upon her tomb,
A record for the times to come.

And neatly getts on boots and spurs:
He knowing best what fits the wars,
Wilt not delay nor make demurres:
But summons all with sound of drum,
Forwarning men heel shortly come.

Which carried is upon her corse,
She bears the beast that still goes forth,
By craft deceaving, not by force,
Seek peace, not war: yet war we must,
When peace deceaves, and proves unjust.
