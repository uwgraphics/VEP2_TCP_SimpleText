A Publication by the Counsel of Virginea, touching the plantation there.
Howsoever it came to pass by Gods appointment, that gouernes all things, that
the fleet of 8 Ships, lately sent to Virginea, by means the Admiral,
wherein were shipped the chief Governors, Sir Thomas Gates, S. George
Summers, and Captain Newport, by tempestuous winds and forcible Current, were
driven so far to the West ward, that they could not in so convenient time
recover Cape Henry, and the Port in Virginea, as by the return of the same
fleet, to answer the expectation of the adventurers in some measure:

By occasion whereof, some few of those unruly youths sent thither, (being of
most leaud and bad condition,) and such as no ground can hold, for want of good
directions there, were suffered by stealth to get abord the ships returning
thence, and are come for England again, giving out in all places where they
come, (to color their own misbehauiour, and the cause of their return with
some pretense) most vile and scandalous reports, both of the Country it self,
and of the Carriage of the business there.

Which has also given occasion, that sundry false rumors and despightfull
speeches have been devised and given out by men that seem of better sort,
being such as lie at home, and do gladly take all occasions to cheer
themselves with the prevention of happy success in any action of public good,
disgracing both the actions and actors of such honorable enterprises, as
whereof they neither know nor understand the true intents and honest ends.

Which howsoever (for a time) it may deter and keep back the hands and
help of many well disposed men, yet men of wisdom and better resolution do
well conceive and know, that these devices infused into the tongues and heads
of such deuisors (by the Father of untruths) do serve for nothing else, but as
a cloak to cover the wretched and leaud prancks of the one sort, and the
stupidity and backwardness of the other, to advance any commendable action
that taxes their purse, and tends not wholly to their own advantage.

And therefore those of his Majesty's Counsel in this honorable plantation, the
Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants interessed therein (rightly
considering that as in all other good Services, (so in this) much loss and
detriment may many ways arise and grow to the due means and manner of
proceeding, which yet no way touches nor empeacheth the action it self, nor
the ends of it, which do still remain entire and safe upon the same grounds of
those manifold Christian duties whereon it was first resolved,) are so far
from yielding or giving way to any hindrance or impeachment of their cheerful
going on, that many of them both honorable and worshipful have given their
hands and subscribed to contribute again and again to new supplies if need
require.

And further, they do instantly prepare and make ready a certain number of
good Ships, with all necessaries, for the right honorable Lord de la Ware,
who intends God assisting, to be ready with all expedition to second the
foresaid Generals, which we doubt not are long since safely arrived at their
wished port in Virginea.

And for that former experience has too dearly taught, how much and many
ways it hurts to suffer Parents to disburden themselves of lascivious
sons, masters of bad servants, and wives of ill husbands, and so to clogge
the business with such an idle crew, as did thrust themselves in the last
voyage, that will rather starve for hunger, then lay their hands to labor:

It is therefore resolved, that no such unnecessary person shall now be
accepted, but only such sufficient, honest and good artificers, as Smiths,
Shipwrights, Sturgeon dressers, Ioyners, Carpenters, Gardeners, Turners,
Coopers, Salt-makers, Iron men for furnasse and hammer, Brickmakers,
Bricklayers, Mineral men, Bakers, Gun-founders, Fishermen, Plough-wrights,
Brewers, Sawyers, Fowlers, Vine-dressers, Surgeons,
and Physicians for the body, and learned Divines to instruct the Colonie, and
to teach the Infidels to worship the true God. Of which so many as will repair
to the house of Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer of the Company to proffer their
service in this action before the number be full, and will put in good sureties
to be ready to attend the said honorable Lord in the voyage, shall be
entertained with those reasonable and good conditions, as shall answer and be
agreeable to each man's sufficiency in his several profession.
