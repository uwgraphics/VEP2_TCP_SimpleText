Turners dish of Lentten stuff, or a Galymaufery.
To the tune of Watton Towns end.


My Masters all attend you,
(...) to hear:
And I will tell you what ^hey cry,
in London all the year,
(...)please you if I can,
I will not be too long,
I pray you all attend a while,
and listen to my song.
(...) The fish-wife first begins,
^
(...), Sprats, or Pleace,
or Cockles for delight.
(...)ve flat Oysters:
then she does change her note
She had need to bake her tongue b^ grease
for she rattles in the throat.
For why they are but ^^^tish,
to ^ell you out of doubt:
(...)sure is to little,
go be ate th(...) bottom out.
Half Pecke for two pence,
I doubt it is a ^odge,
^,
(...) people they do do^ge.
^
^
^
^
(...) Car came running,
^
(...) her greasy tub,
and away that she did run.
But she did give a blessing,
to some hat not to all:
To bea^es load to ^^^urne,
and there to let it fall,
The miller with his golden thumb,
and his dusty neck:
If that he grind but two bushels,
he needs must steal a peck.
The Weauer and the Tailor,
(...) they be sure:
They cannot work but they must steal,
to keep their hands in ure,
For it is a common proverb,
throughout all the town,
The Tailor he must cut three sleeves,
for every woman's gown.
Mark but the Water man,
attending for hie fare:
Of hot and could, of wet and dry,
he always takes a share,
He carries bony lasses,
over to the plays,
And here and there he gets a bit,
and that his stomach stays.
There was a stinging boy,
did write to ride to Rumford:
When I go to my (...) stool,
I will put him in a comfort:
But what I leave behind,
shall be no private gain:
But all is one when I am gone.
let him take it for his pain.
Old shoes for new Broomes,
the broom man he does sing:
For hats or caps or buskins,
or any ^uld Pooch rings,
(...) Mat a bed Mat,
(...) a Pas,
^
a bigger or a less.
Ripe Chery ri^^,
the Coster-(...),
Pipins fine, or Pears,
another after hies,
With basket on his head,
his living to advance,
And in his purse a pair of Dice,
for to play at Mumchance.
Hot Pippin pies,
to sell unto my friends:
Or pu^ing pies ^n pans,
well stuffed with Candles ends,
Will you by any Milk,
I hear a wench to cry,
With a pa^^e of fresh Cheese and, cream
another after hies.
Oh the wench went neately,
my thought it did me good:
To see her cheery cheeks,
so dimpled ^re with blood,
Her wastecoate washed white:
as any lilli-flower,
would I had time to talk with her
the space of half an hour.
Buy black, says the blacking man
the best that ere was seen:
It Is good for poor men Citizens
to make their shoes to shine,
Oh it is a rare comodity,
it must not be for-got,
It will make them glister gallantly
and quickly make them rot.
the world is full of thread bare poets,
that live upon their pen:
But they will write too eloquent,
they are such witty men.
But the Tinker with his budget,
the beggar with his walled,
And Turners turned a gallant man,
at making of a Ballet.
FINIS.

The second part, or you are welcome my guest to your Lentten fare if you come
when Lent is gone, you shall have better cheer, To the same tune,
That Is the fat feel of the Curtin,
and the lean feel of the Full:
Since Shanke did have to sing his rimes,
he is counted but a gu^l.
The players of the Bank side,
the round Globe and the Swan,
Will reach you ^^^e ^^^kes of love,
but the ^uil will play the man.
But what do I stand tattling,
of such Idle ^^yes:
I had better go to Smith-field,
to play among the Boys,
(...) you skeeting and decoying Lads,
with your base Art-ti^l^re:
I would wish you (...) Newgate,
and withal the Pillary.
And some there be in patcht gowns,
I know not what they be:
They pinch (...) Contry men,
with nimming of a fee.
For where they get a (...),
they will make him pay so dear,
They Will entertain more in a day,
then he shall in a year.
Which wakes them trim up houses,
made of brick, and stone:
And poor men go a begging,
when house and land is gone.
Some there be with both hands,
will swear they will not dally,
Till they have turned all vpsie down,
as mnay use to sa^ley,
You Per^ers give good measure,
when as your wares you sell:
though your pa^^ be (...) your th^^^ will slip,
your tricks I know (...),
And you that (...) wares by weight,
and live upon the trade:
Some beams (...) waits to light
such trikes there have bin played.
Buy small (...) great Coals,
I have them one (...) bark:
The Goose (...)
you may (...) quacke,
Thus (...) the black C^^^^r,
whose living is so loose,
As he does (...) ore,
sometimes he (...) a goose.
Thou (...) with thy money bags,
that lives so at ease:
By gaping after gould thou do,
thy mightty Go(...)
And for (...)
and thy (...)
Except thou do repent thy sins,
hell fire will be thy portion.
For first I came to Hounds-dich,
then round about I crept:
Where cruelty is crowned chief,
and piety fast a sleep,
Where Usury gets profit,
and brokers bear the bell,
Oh fie upon this deadly sin,
it sinkes the house to hell.
The man that sweepes the chimneys,
with the bunsh of thorns:
And one his neck a trusse of peles,
tipped al with horns.
With care he is not cumbred,
he lives not in dread:
For though he wear^s them on his pele,
some wear them one there head.
The Landlord with his racking rents,
turn poor men out of door:
There children go a begging,
where they have spent their store,
I hope none is offended:
at that which is indicted,
If any be, let him go home,
and take a pen and write it.
Buy a trap a Mouse trap,
a tormentor for the fleas:
The hangman works but half the day,
he lives too much at ease.
Come let us leave this boys play,
and idle prittle prat,
And let us go to nine holes,
to spurn point or to cat.
Oh you nimble fingured lads,
that (...) upon your wits:
Take heed of Tyburne Ague,
for they be dangerous fits.
For many a proper man,
for to supply his lack:
Does leap a leap at Tyburne,
which makes his neck to crack.
And to him that writ this song,
I give ^his simple lot:
Let every one be ready,
to give him half a pot.
And thus I do con^ude,
wishing both health and peace,
To those that are laid in their bed,
and cannot sleep for fleas.
FINIS.
W. Turner.
