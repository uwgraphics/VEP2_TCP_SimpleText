Savior CHRIST, Sent to the Pastoures of the Flemish Church in Antwerp, (who

the other Ministers of the Gospel.

Translated out of French by Geffray Fenton

Here may the christian Reader learn to know what is the true participatio^ of
the body of CHRIST, and what is the lauful use of the holy Supper.

CVM PRIVILEGIO.

To the right worshipful John Byron Esquier, Geffray Fenton wishes a happy
new year, with a gladsome continuance of many.
IN observing (sir) this last year your order and condition of doing, I found
the custom and course of your virtues nothing inferior to the common opinion
of the same. Whereof as I proved peculiarly in my self by many means and times,
but most by a civil conversation of your company during the best part of the
summer, so I account my self no less unworthy of such benefit passed, than
unmeet eftsoons to use or participate with the like, if such det be not
discharged by some thankful argument of good will, compounded with matter of
mine own endeavor, according to the quality of my tale^t. And albeit I have at
times heretofore protested unto you simply my serviceable and unfeigned zeal
(whereof I hope you doubt not) yet me thinks, with the nature of a barren soil
yelding no fruit, the same might seem no less unprofitable unto you, than
imperfecte in my self, if it be not approved with some absolute and unfeigned
show, and that in the publyke eye of the world, in which respect I have
presumed to lay before you this little Translation, a work neither improper for
the purpose of good doctrine, nor impertinent to the profession of a true
Christian, and for the matter, it discovers a a most perfect Method or plot,
to discern the principal points of our Religion, with certain special
places of Scripture toward the end, to induce the church to unity, and the
people to embrace the league of charity left us by Christ as well in the
example of himself, enduryng sundry sorts of villainous reproaches, as in the
president of his Apostles and Prophets, who suffered with great patience the
barbarous disposition of the enemies to their religion.

This as I culled out amongst other, as a work resembling your own virtues,
so in the often reading it, I doubt not you shall find a happy confirmation
of judgment in good things, the same as the Apostle says, being one chief
and principal fruit of knowledge, and therefore most necessary that we
acquaint our minds with godly exercises and meditations of Religion, praying
you lastly to let it receive your protection, to the end our country and
Christian neighbors, by your mean the rather, may plentifully participate
in the benefit of the same, wherein also I account my travail sufficiently
answered, if this become thankful to you, in sort of an earnest penny or first
offer of my good will, reserving notwithstanding, to give a better show
hereafter, as time with quiet leisure shall assist me. And so God give you a
good new year, and confirm us all in his holy fear.

At my lodging the tenth of Decembre. 1569. Your sure friend Geffray Fenton.

A prayer of the Author, for the concord of doctrine, and unity in wills in
divine things, apperteyning to the advancement of the Gospel of CHRIST.
O Eternal and merciful Lord, who as thou art God of peace, love and concord,
so disse^tions quarrels and debates are hateful unto thee: We see how (with
good right) thou chastisest our malice and rebellion against thee, by the
diversity of opinions and strange judgments reigning at this day amongst men,
specially in the cause of religion. In the beginning (Lord) thou have created
man to thine own image and likeness, to the end that he and his posterity
might be one thing with thee, having one only opinion led according to thy
holy word and manifestation and one will affected to embrace that which thou
deman dest, whereupon might follow works conformable to thy divine and holy
law.

But the serpent enemy of all peace, and on the contrary a lover of
dissension and discord, taught our first Fathers the lesson of infidelity,
distrust, presumption and arrogant curiosity. Alas (our good God and creator)
that we feel and make daily experience of miserable effects of that lesson
printed by Satan in our hearts: for every one of us strives to be a god upon
earth, every one pretends to be able, (by the touch of his own judgment) to
discern which is good or evil, what is agreeable or inconvenient to thy
divine Majesty, yea every one thinks to be the master that ought to instruct
his neighbor. Take pity of us (O Lord) and deface in our hearts this
perverse lesson (full of ambition and pride) make us understand in good
earnest, that thou art he only, to whom belongs to discern between the good
and evil, and between the truth and dreams, and that it is thou lord who by
thy eternal word Jesus Christ, give light, manifestation, and knowledge
of thy secrets to those that fear thee: thou art he alone, who by thy holy
spirit do direct and teach thy disciples, which make them of thy schole and
word. Without thee (Lord) we are lost and confounded, without thy truth
we are liers, without thy doctrine we be falsefiers, without thy instruction
we be presumptuous and proud. Alas, we, even we miserable creatures, to give
our selves an estimation in the world, forsake thy eternal word, which is
the tree of everlasting life, and go devouring the fruit of knowledge given by
Satan: From thence (Lord) it comes, that our knowledge and wisdom is
accompanied with pride and arrogant contention, not giving place one to an
other, whereby we show that our wisdom and knowledge is not from above for
by the same we feign to search thy glory, and to bliss and praise thee as
our GOD and Father: and in the mean while, to mainteyne our opinions, we
accurse men fashioned to thine own Image and likeness, in such sort that
out of one only mouth proceeds both curse and blissing: a thing which might
seem both impossible and incredible, if daily experience did not discover
their manifest and absolute effects. For how is it possible, that a fountain
should cast out of one vent or spoute, water that is pleasant, and withal
bitter and salt? Who can believe, that a Fig tree can bring forth Olyues, or
a Vine yield Figs? Truly Lord, such contrarieties are not so contrary in
natural things, as is manifested in things spiritual wherein we deal. For how
should men believe our words, saying we love God, when by our works we
discover a certain hate* to our neighbors? We say, we search no other thing
than the advancement of the kingdom of Christ, and yet we afflict and
persecute the very members of Christ: We cry with open throat, that we are of
the Ambassadors of the holy Gospel of peace, and yet our attemptes and
councels are not but of wars, murders, and effusions of man's blood. Oh most
wretched that we are, we raise and lift up our hands to pray and call upon
thee, which notwithstanding are all sprinkled and goared with the blood of
those which thou had made lively, by thy wonderful providence.

Seeing that such is our wisdom, sprung of our bel^^fe, that is to say,
earthly, sensual and diuellishe, accompanied with enute, wrath, trouble, with
all works of peruersitie: give us Lord by thy bounty thy wisdom from an
high, which may be pure, peaceable, moderate, tractable, full of mercy and
good fruits, and far from debates, dissentions, and all hypocrisy: bring to
pass lord, that the fruits of justice may be sown in peace for those which
use and make peace, and by those which be the true pronou^cers and shewers of
the same peace: bring to pass Lord, that we show our selves wise and well
advised, not only in vain words and babble of Religion, but let us bring
forth in our conversation the fruits of the Gospel wherein we believe,
accompanying our faith with works of humility, and celestial wisdom.

Take pity on us (O Lord) by thy bounty and mercy, for we confess to have
offended thee greatly and without measure, and we confess that the rebukes
which thou sendest upon us, are but the just rewards of our merits. Thou
Lord suffer, that we have war, dissentions, quarelles and debates, and
that we commit unnatural murder one upon an other, and that more for the
cause of our particular opinions, than in respect of zeal to thy glory,
(whereof notwithstanding we vaunte our selves) thou sendest to us the
messangers and Heraldes of thy wrath, that is to say, infections of the air,
contagious diseases, pestilence, famine, shipwracks, with other like arguments
of thy heavy displeasure toward us, and yet we harden our hearts: thou
suffer that strange Nations, Barbarous and Idolaters do raise them selves
against us for the overthrow of the Churches and Assemblies where thy name
ought to be glorified, and we trusting in our own forces, industries, and
frail wisdoms, will not have recourse to thee, and therefore with good right
oh Lord, thou leauest us to the mercy of the infidelles, and suffer the
superstitious to have victory over us. Oh Father of mercy, bestow upon us
thy pitiful eyes, reform our hearts and our affections, engraue in us the
only zeal of thy glory, graffe in our minds the true tree of life which is
Jesus Christ our Savior and Redeemer, the fruts of whom do make us lively:
let us be filled with true faith, lively hope, mutual and brotherly charity,
and that we exercising in works of true mortification, justice, innocence and
holiness, may be in the end possessors of the eternal life, for the obteyning
whereof we have bin chosen and predestinate to the praise of thee, (oh father
of mercy, and of thy Christ our only savior) to whom with thy holy Spirit be
glory and praise for ever.

Amen.
A prayer to Jesus Christ, for peace and unity in the Church,
by Geffray Fenton
O Sovereign Lord, who being the eternal word and true GOD with God thy
father, did take our nature to visit in form of man the poor children of
Adam, lost by their infidelity, distruste, and perverse opinion against their
Creator. And also by thy mean and remedy, have eftesones restablissed the
confederation between GOD and us, approving the same most painfully in the
mortal martyrdom of thy most innocent body bleeding on the cross for the
expiacion of our sins: we beseech thee (oh Savior of the world) that even as
thou art come to consu^mate and confirm our reco^ciliation, thou would
also reconcile our hearts, knitte our wills, and send thy spirit of truth
amongst us, to the end, that we all concurring in one judgment and opinion,
may remember that we are called to be members of one body, whereof Lord, we
acknowledge thee to be the chief and supreme head, and so detesting inciuill
partialities, we may be of one opinion, agree in one mind, and use one mutual
and charitable direction touching the matter of our Religion. Thou have left
unto us (O Lord) the celebration of thy holly Supper, as a memortal of our
communion and spiritual unity with thee, and also to instruct us in such
laws of charity, as ought to be of familiar conversation amongst us all. And
yet we (such is the nature of our fragilitie and condition of our
unworthiness) as we abuse the excellent benefit of that most high favor,
seeing that in place to tie and conioyne our selves with thee, we do more
estraunge us from thee, and that by reason of our quarelles and questions of
contention: In place to consider that we are one body, one church, and one
bread made of sundry grains, we show our selves proud, and give sundry
proves of our ambition in seeking to establishe a special estimation of our
peculiar and private opinions: in handling very often thy presence in thy holly
Supper by subtle disputation, we become far from thy true and lively
presence, in contending whether the sinners and unfaithful may communicate thy
body, we make our selves sinners and incapable to receive and enjoy thy
benefits: lastly and in effect, oh Lord, our zeal is so indiscrete, that in
stryuing to enterteyne the purity of the doctrine of faith, we break the
league and law of charity, yea and in persecuting with rebuke such as we
account to be heretics in the doctrine of faith: our malice, with want of
discretion makes us seem transnatured into heretics of charity, corrupting
the means of communication and brotherly unity.

I beseech thee therefore (oh son of God) let thy gracious pity fall upon
us, and so open the eyes of our understanding, as we may discern the true
fruit of thy holy institution and ordinance, take from amongst us all sects
and varieties of opinions, and reduce us at last to the obedience of thy holy
and only word: reveal unto us thy holy spirit with this privilege of grace,
that by his virtue he may draw us all into one corporation and body, whereof
thou (O Lord) may be head, and let him breath into us strength and power
to persevere in works of true Justice, innocence and holiness, during our
course in this tragical and miserable pilgrimage, and in the end let (we
beseech thee) the same holy spirit translate us into the eternal life,
(purchased to our uses by the sacrifice and oblation of thy most precious
death) wherein thou raignest now gloriously with the Father and holy Ghost, and
there shall remain infinitely.

AMEN.
To my most dearly beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Redeemer and
advocate of men toward the heavenly Father, my brother Ministers and Pastors
in the church of Antwerp, namyng them selves of the Church of Auspurge, Grace
and peace from God and his Son IESV CHRIST, to the end, that by the bond of
his holy spirit, we may al be knit in the unity and Confession of the Gospel
of Christ.
AT my first coming to this town of Antwerpe (right honorable in Christ) and
that at the request of certain the Faithful there, I found cause of singular
comfort in the view of the wonderful woork raised up by the Lord, by mean
of his servants, and that in so short time, as saving to such as have
assisted it, it may seem no less impossible than incredible. For if we
wonder in certain Trees and Fruits, who sometimes yield increase above custom,
or against ye common course of Nature, as though the Lord were of purpose to
releue and restore some country afflicted with hunger: what may we say of
these spiritual plants which the Father of mercy so sodeinly and against al
hope of man, has set and planted in these Low countries, and specially in this
city of Antwerpe? Truly we are bound to acknowledge it as a work of strange
marvel of our God, and to say with the prophet, this incredible increase has
bin made by the Lord, whom we find worthy of admiration in our eyes: it is the
right hand of God which has reveled his virtue: it is the right hand of God
that has exalted us: it is the right hand of God that has manifested his
power, we shall not die at al, but we shall live to declare ye doings of ye
Lord: wherein as I entered more deeply into ye view and consideration of these
things, so I thought it also an office and duty in me to cry with the said
Prophet: Confirm Lord, and advance the work thou haste begone in us: buyld
up again the walls of thy holy temple: restore the ruins of thy Heavenly
Jerusalem, to the end that the Kings and Princes of the earth may come to do
thee homage, and offer presents: gather together agein O God, the dispersed of
Israel.

2 This was the cause wherein I rejoiced for certain days with glad
continuance, till upon further view of the matters of estate within the city,
I found occasion to convert my co^tentme^t intoo co^ceites of sorrow, as seeing
on every side with what diligence Satan labored to hinder the advancement of
this church, not only by means of open enemies, but also by the indiscretion
and want of regard in such as name themselves master Masons in the house of
God: for such as feared God and wished a publication of his glory, cried out
and exclamed that the chair of truth was become ye chair of dissentio^, serving
no more as a pulpit to preach Jesus Christ, the appeasor of troubled
consciences, to pronounce an unity, a brotherly charity, nor ye mortificatio^
of ye old Adam, with ye wicked motions of concupiscence, but rather it was used
as a place of inuectiues, and injuries, with words of malice In the Pulpit
ought not be preached other words than of God, to know and serve Christ.
tending to a mutual hate of one toward another, and dissension of doctrine,
wherein upon inquiry of such fault, with the circumstance and authors of the
same, I find your side not least guilty, as being such amongst you, who in
open assembly, with words and libels of malice, are not ashamed to call the
other Ministers of the Gospel, Heretics, Sacramentaries, rebels against the
state, and people unworthy of place in the common wealth, with other words
improper for the majesty of such a place, which is consecrated purposely to
teach the word and will of our God.

3 Now (brethren) if such or such like matter of reproach should be pronounced
in the Pulpit of certain Moonks or monstrous Friars, the very organs of the
Roman Antechrist, sent of their suppostes to trouble the church of Christ, to
darken his glory, and resist the advancement of his kingdom, we would endure
them with patience, as knowing well enough yt such sort of Prophets be the
disciples of Balaam, who sell their tongs to curse the people of God, yea
sometimes against the sense of their propre conscience: we assure our selves
that the mouth of such hypocrites cannot bring forth other than words of
infection and full of taste of all evil: for they as they are painted
sepulchers, so can they not vomit up other Description of the false Prophets
and prechers of the Papists.
matter than such as is covertly couched within, that is to say, all infection
and filthynesse: And we are most certain, that those kind of people
bequeathed to Baall and contentement of their belly, seeing the fall of their
Marmit by little and little, will enforce them selves to exclaim against them
that discover their abuses, hypocrisies, and villainous trumperies: we believe
also that such suppostes of Satan, who from the beginning has bin the
Author of dissension, a lover of murder (with desire of effusion of blood) will
labor in the imitation of their father and master, and that (under the
pretense of the Gospel) they will proclaim sedition and trouble, and as the
Prophet says, vomit furious matter against such as stuff not their bellies
according to their fancies and fashions of custom: of such sort of railers
we receive no great care, seeing we are not ignorant with what judgment
and punishment, God will visit them though he be long: for they be of that
sort of whom the Apostle Jude speaks in his Epistle catholic, as upon
whom evil shall happen, Read the Epistle of S. Judas the Apostle.
for they follow the trayn of Cain: they aba^den them selves into the error of
the hyer of Baalam, they shall perish according to the contradiction of Corus.
They are stained at the Banquet of the charitable and Faithful, feedyng them
selves without fear: they are clouds without water, carried away with every
wind: they be trees whose fruit is rotten, corrupted and of no commodity,
twice dead, once by the universal corruption of Adam, wherewith all men be
stained, and the other by the death of their Monkery, with the which they have
dedicated to Baal their bodies and their services: they be ragyng waves of the
sea, skumming their villainies: errant stars for whom is prepared the
shadows of the everlasting darkness: They are murmurers, quarellers,
walkyng according to their covetousness, their mouths pronou^cing words of
venomous substance, and loving men only for their profit. They incense
diuisyons, and are people of sensuality, impartyng nothing with the Spirit:
They are the very paynter and portraite which the Apostle speaks of in such
sort of Preachers. And therefore do we esteem of them as they deserve, not
fearyng any harm they can do to the troop or fellowship elect of God, for they
discover sufficiently their poison and the leuyn of the Phariseys.

4 But touching you (dear and honorable brethren) one word proceeding from
your mouth pierces the heart, and gives us cause of singular sorrow, with
fear least the same stir up slander to the flock of Jesus Christ: And woe
be to him that shall be the cause of such slander against one of the least,
it were better that such a one had fastened to his neck a great Mylnstone and
cast into the bottom of the sea, than to be suffered to offend and put
dissension in the church, which the Lord begins to norish in this town, and
who now being in her cradle, is in more necessity to be fed with the true
word of god, releued in her afflictions, and comforted in her persecutions,
than to be disquieted with subtle and curious questions, divisions and debates
upon the matter of our confession: wherein as we both feel and see the
wonderful benefits which the Lord has laid both upon you and us, having
drawn us out of the miserable quagmier and marish of superstition and
idolatry amongst the Papists, so let us wish (that as true Ministers of God)
we may employ our selves with one accord to set forth the glory A mean to
accord questions concerning the doctrine.
of him, who of prisoners of darkness, has made us happy members of his
most clear light. If there be any thing which you judge not well understood
of us, were it not better to come to conference with us, or use brotherly
admonition, than to exclaim in the Pulpit, and fill the Bookebinders shoppes
with Inuectiues and Apologies of spite? were it not better (with invocation of
the name of ye Lord) to entertain quietly the affairs of the advancement of
his glory, than to levy war against our selves with the shot of the pen,
whose wounds are far more dangerous and incurable, than the smitings either
of the bow or crosbowe: because the one offends but War of learned men most
slanderous.
the body and flesh, and the other pierces both depely and bloudily the
renoume of the person, which every one holds in value more dear and
precious than either gold or silver, with all the riches in the world.

5 Alas miserable and wretched that we are, what condemnation, what judgment
do we heap upon our heads when we preach to the Soldiers to lay away their
arms and forbear to offend common wealths, and we, even we our selves, do
carry in our Inkhorns weapons most sharp, with arrows of poison to thunder
upon such as do not offer themselves wholly to our advise and opinions, and
refuse to hazard their Faith in the interpretations which we make of Gods
word?

6 This arrogante ouerweenyng is Whereof it comes that the audience in the
reformed church be deformed in living.
the cause why the Lord suffers that the fruit of our preachyngs is either
none at all, or at least of so little effect, that our Audience in their life
and conversation, do declare what slender knowledge and fear of GOD they
learn by our Exhortations. God suffers also to fall upon us Inquisitours
and Persecutoures in the very same sort, that we presume to be the Censors
of the Faith of others. And because we will rule all the world by the touch
of the Sentence and advise of this or that man, the Lord incenseth the very
Children them selves to call us Parciall Sectatoures, and Admiratours of the
opynions of men, namyng some Martinistes, some Caluinistes, some Ozeandrines,
some Melancthonystes, and some Brentiens, with diverse other like names, and
that with good right: because we have not our eyes fixed on the only
aduauncemente of the glory of Jesus Christ and his Church, which is
Catholic and universal: But every one will deal aparte, every one entice and
draw his audience aparte, every one maynteyne the renoume of his institutour,
and that which worse is, every one as supreme Judge gives sentence of
condemnation without appeal against others.

7 Of this miserable cause it comes to pass, that this Church being at
this day delivered from the insupportable inquisition and tyranny of the
Papists, and that by the grace of GOD, and goodness of our King and
Sovereign Magistrate, we have notwithstanding amongst our selves supreme
inquisitors, who with an arrogancy above the Pharisees call the other dogs,
and worldlings, not considering belike, (such is their arrogancy) that this
word worldlyng, or of the world, carries with it an vnreuerent spyte to the
body of Christ, according to that he himself does say, that the world is his
enemy, and that he will not pray for it: Al which condemnation is founded upon
that that the worldlings (as they call them) will not accommodate themselves to
the administration of the Sacraments in their fashion, nor flourish in
imaginations and questions of subtlety, but are contented in the simplicity
of the word of God, with direction of the holy Spirit to instruct their
consciences.

8 Other there be who of their confessions, Catechismes, Commentaries, and
traditions, make as it were a fifth gospel, giving no less authority to their
particular interpretations, than if they were of the Articles of Faith, not
refusyng to call all them heretics, who point by point do not follow their
imaginations, which although were good and substanciall to edify, yet are
they none other tha^ the breath of men, and therefore unworthy of comparison
with the eternal word.

9 These things (Brethren) with the consideration of them mouyng no small sorrow
in my mind, foreseing (as it were) the breach which Satan might make in the
house and troop of God by such a mean, procured me to attempt familiarly one
of your brethren and companions in the woork of God, who as he seemed of some
superintendence and authority amongst you, so I imparted with him the M.
Yllyryc.
great slander growyng to the neighbor churches thereabout by such
differences and dissentions manifestly published, not only by books of
infamy, but also in injurious inuectiues, in open assemblies, whom I
requested in the name of the Lord, to exhort his companions to forbear their
further proceedings in such sort, with discontinuance of their slanderous
order of doings, altogether unworthy of the ministry of Christ.

10 His answer hereuntoo argued his sufficient forwardness, complaining albeit
against others, and saying that the best mean for accord, were to bring in
disputation, and to handle chiefly the question upon the Lords Supper, upon
the diverse and sundry construction whereof, sprung both the disorder and
dissension: I said there was slender hope of present accord this way, if both
the one and other would not disclaim their stout and strange order in
proponing their opinions and interpretations: For (said I) if they observe no
more modesty in their words than they have used temperance in their books
and wrytyngs, neither can the cause be determined, nor the error reduced,
for which respect I account it not out of purpose to take a Confession of
Faith, and imparte with the people those Articles wherein we all agree,
leaving the rest that may bring likelihood of dissension or slander to the
Church.

11 Herein he seemed to aprpoue my advise, with persuasion that to take the
Confession of Auspurge were most necessary to enforce this accord, subsignyng
such Articles, as with good conscience we might receive, and interpret the
other according to our understanding, which we have already done, with
meaning to bring them to light to the edification of the Church, to the end
every one may see that the controversy is not so great as is given out to the
people, who being both troubled and amazed with such diversities, knows not
what pathe to tread, hearing some preach that Christ is here, and other say
he is not there, but here: The Church of Christ is not such one, but ours
is the right Church: we are of Paul, and they be of Cephas, and others of
Apollo. Alas are we baptized either in the name of Paul, John, or Martine? Is
not only Jesus Christ our Redeemer? Is it not in his name that we are
baptized and brought into the Church? Is not he the sovereign Doctoure,
graduated not at Paris, but in Paradyse, whom our Heavenly Father has
ordained for our chief schoolmaster with express commandment, to hear him?
Why then do we seek so many masters and forgers of Doctrine? To conclude, I
desired the said Minister to absteyne from injurious inuectiues and words of
quarrel in books, with exhortation to his companions to modesty and seemly
temperance in their prechyngs: also to persuade the people to faith,
mortification and brotherly charity: which albeit, they have not observed,
but rather in the contrary have used words of slander in the very Pulpit,
teaching by that mean their audience to imitate their disorders: And which
worse is, you other my brethren, even of late have caused to be imprinted
certain Libels, wherein you have reuersed the names of persons* and by
conversion and change of letters have most injuriously handled a certain
minister of the Gospel, calling him a brand of hell, or such like name of
reproach, a subtlety far unworthy your vocation.

12 If these matters grow to continuance, it is not to be douted (good
brethren) that the judgment of God will not thunder upon our heads, when
(believe me) the living God will know how and where to find us, though we be
under the protection of great Princes, for the Lord will not leave unpunished
such insolencis and mistakings of his dear Church, the which as he has
boughte with his blood and delivered from the tirannie of Antechrist, so now
such people would eftsoons suppeditate and persecute her, under color of
piety and instruction of certain persons, whom the Lord has stirred up to
minister and serve in his temple. And to speak more clearly in this matter,
know ye (good brethren) that touching Martine Luther, Phillip Melancthon, The
authoriti^ of Luther and other Doctors of the gospel
with other like men, we esteem the^ true servants of god, to whom as the
holy spirit has plentyfully imparted his gifts and graces, so have they
labored with an ernest care both to impugn the abuses crept into our
christian religion, and also to manifest the truth of the Gospel of Christ:
albeit we must and do acknowledge them to be no more than me^, and so by
consequence subject to be ignorant in many things: for so God uses to bestow
his gifts and graces upon men, as the condition of their ignorant nature may
show that they be not Gods upon earth.

13 Besides that, it happens many times, that the servants of God do observe a
certain special wisdom, as not willing to reveal all they do understand,
fearyng their audience not to be as yet capable of such Doctrine, the same
happenyng The wisdom of S. Peter.
even to Saint Peter the Apostle of Christ, who albeeit had received
visybly the holy Spirit, yet he esteemed the time not yet conuenyent to
manifest to the Jews the abolition of the Law, fearyng least by such a
mean the Preaching of the Gospel should be brought in contempt, and the
publication of the same hyndered. On the contrary, Saint Paul was of
opynion, that in a matter of so great The zeal of S. Paul.
importance ought to be no dread of danger, but to make open and publyke
manyfestation of the liberty, which Galath. 2.
the Lord had brought unto his Church. In like sort we have reason to
presume, that these good servants of GOD, Luther and Melancthon, seeing the
great resystaunce of the world against the preaching of the pure doctrine,
and the abolition of the Papists abuses, judged it an act of wisdom to give
a little place too such fury of the time, and to gain the hearts of the
people gently without making them Strangers to the Doctrine of the
Sacraments, with expectation from day too day of more proper and fytte Read

men. For who can deny that Martine Luther was ignoraunte in many things at
his beginning to preach, which the Lord revealed unto him after, affyrmynge
in the words of his own mouth, that GOD had sent him, not so much to
edify and reestablyshe the Church of Christ, as to ruinate and batter the
kingdom of Antechrist, wherein he found daily such change of abuses unworthy to
be supported in the christian Religion, that in the end he protested that the
Mass deserved to be abolished, which Melancthon in the end of the confession
of Auspurge, mainteyned contrarily, professing the Mass to be yet retained in
their Churches. All this notwithstanding, you (my brethren) of this time, will
not as far as I find, agree that the Mass is yet retained in your
churches, no not in the sort that the confession of Auspurge propounds it:
The words of Melancthon be these: Falso accusantur ecclesiae nostrae, quod
Missam aboleant: Retinetur enim Missa apud nos, and summa Reuerentia
celebratur, seruantur et vsitatae Ceremoniae fere omnes, praeterquam quod

abolishe the Mass, for the Mass is retained with us, and is celebrated with
great reverence, with an use and observation of almost al What Supper the
Protestants had in the beginning.
the accustomed ceremonies, saving that in some places there be certain
Canticles in the Dutche, entermedled with those that are soong in the Latin,
and that to teach the people.

14 See (brethren) how you would now aduow so goodly a reformation of Mass,
being assured that such institution is the true heap of vanities invented by
men, and tending to the profanation and abolition of the holy Supper of the
Lord: but if others in the very time of Luther and Melancthon, have bin moved
with the spirit of God, and with a zeal of S. Paul have resisted such
simulation (well affected notwithstanding to the glory of God) proves it
therefore in us any duty of observation of such Ceremonies, having regard only
to the authority of Peter? God defend. No, let Peter remain still as Peter,
and Martine as Martine, that is to say, as a man that may fail, and let the
spirit of God be increased by the organs and instruments which he shall stir
up to manifest the truth of his gospel, whether he be Paul or Zwinglius, or
Oecolampadius, or any other of less authority than they. And for our parts,
such organs and instruments of God, let us receive, honor, and have in
singular commendation, without persuasion or belief that they be innocent, or
that they can not err, or that they be not ignorant of some things. Let us
believe, that from day to day our Lord will stir up such like organs and
instruments to advance his glory, and to augment the light of his holy Truth,
if our own unthankfulness be not a bar to such liberality begone by our
GOD.

15 Besides (brethren) I consider the lamentable time, wherein those holy men
did live, as being employed rather to purge and cleanse the fylthynesse of
Papistrie, than to study or consider of the introduction of the pure Truth:
they were rather used in the resistaunce of the fury of Antechriste and his
suppostes, to flee from one coast to an other, to make Apologies and defenses,
to answer the falsehodes that were laid upon them by diverse, and to dispute
with the monstrous Moonkes of their Purgatory and Rogations, than that they
had leisure and quiet liberty to search by meditation the truth of the
christian doctrine manyfested in the divine word. By which occasion it came to
pass, that their writings were stuffed with so many opprobrious and spiteful
words unworthy of the true servant of God, and perfect pronouncers of the
gospel of peace, which notwithstanding as we support such infirmities, as
having regard to so wicked a time: So now that God has sent us so many beams
of his light, let us leave to live and remain so blind as in times past.

16 My meaning (dear brethren) in all this discourse, has not bin to other
purpose than to declare the small occasion we have as well one as another, to make
gods or (to say more truly) idols of our doctors, and by their occasions to
entertein us in parcialities, dissentio^s and debates upon ye matter of our
doctrine, to ye great slander of the poor and weak consciences and notable
resistance of the propagation of the church: wherein if the Corinthians have bin
rebuked because they made Partialities to maintein the renoume of S. Paul, the
chosen vessel of GOD, Apostle of Jesus Christ, Doctoure of the Gentiles, and
to speak in one word, a man endued with most singular and excellent gifts,
how may God lay it against us, who contend, quarrel, make continual war,
and (as a man would say) devour one an other as Dogs and Cats, breaking
always the bond of charity, which Jesus Christ has left of such
estimation?

17 When the Lord would mark his disciples and children of his father, he
willed them not to follow the confession of Auspurge, nor the Catechism of
Martin or of John, but he says: In this men shall The mark of the christians.
John. 13.
know you are my disciples, if ye love one other: Alas most blind and
miserable that we are, whilst we dispute of the true or false interpretation
of the words of the Sacrament of unity, we break the very unity it self:
in contendyng whether the wicked, infidel, and unworthy receive as well the
body of Christ in the Supper, as the children of GOD, we disfurnishe our
selves of the very Christ, and make our selves of the number of them that
receive him not at all: in serching whether Christ come in flesh, in Spirit,
or in Sacrament, we do deprive our selves of the true communion of Christ: for
he that hates his brother, Christ dwells not in him: in siftyng curiously
whether the body of Christ be given to us in the bread, under the bread, or
with the bread, we cut our selves off from the true body of Christ, and make
us members of Satan, the father of dissentions, quarelles, contentions and
debates.

18 And for my opinion upon the matter of the holy Supper, I will say in few
words (good brethren) what I understand, leaving to every one his liberty
to follow that which God shall teach him. We know right well, that ye meaning
of our redeemer Jesus coming into this world, was to manifest to men the good
will of his heavenly Father toward them: and how his Divine majesty had
provided to remedy the fault, transgression and disobedience of the first
Doctrine of the holy Supper of Christ.
Adam, by the innocence, most pure justice, and obedience satisfactorie of
the second and heavenly Adam. And that men might be delivered of the ire and
judgment of God, putting themselves under the wyngs and couerture of this
Sovereign and eternal Sacrificatour. And The sum of the doctrine of Christ.
for as much as the Divine word does show unto us the malediction of men
and transgression ageynste the will of GOD, by words taken of our corporal
nouriture, saying, that as man has eaten the fruit of a tree defended him by
his Creatoure, and that by mean of the same eating, he has made himself
enemy of the Lord: In like manner Jesus Christ our Redeemer declares to us
by similitude of eating and drinkyng, the Reconciliation toward GOD, that his
obedience has brought us, as if he would clearly say, that Man having eaten
of a forbidden Fruit, has purchased malediction, where as in eating now of
a fruit given him by the hand of GOD, be has woonne benediction. The fruit
and Tree of life which we ought to eat, is even very he which Christ is
the Fruit of the Tree of life.
brings us such happy news, who with his virtue and power iudicible, is so
tied and joined with us by the mean of Faith and bond of his holy Spirit,
that he entertaineth our souls in spiritual and heavenly life, even as the
bread and wine nourishes our bodies in corporal life.

20 Vsyng this similitude the Lord says in the sixth of Saint John, that he
him self is the bread of life, and gyuing life, which is descended from
Heaven, and that who eats of this bread shall live eternally: That is to
say, he shall escape the Curse gotten by eating of the Fruit defended. He
says also that his flesh is the true meat, and his blood the true drink:
And he that eats his flesh and drynketh his blood, dwells in Christ, and
Christ in him, who is our second and Heavenly The true understanding of the
words of Christ. John. 6.
Adam, within whose body it is necessary we be incorporated, or that he
incorporate him self in us, to the end that we may be able to appear
before GOD, covered with the mantell of his most innocente flesh full of all
Justice.

21 And because our nature is most dull and far from the true understanding of
these mysteries, our Redeemer Jesus Cause of the celebration and institution
of the Supper.
is not only content to propounde unto us the conjunction which we ought to
have with him, by these similitudes and comparisons of eating and drinking, but
also has sought to show us by some visible Ceremony, the very same thing
that he has taught us by word, to the end that not only our ears might
receive the instruction of his preaching, but also our eyes feed of some
visible representation of that which we ought to be in Christ, and Christ in
us, that is to say, that we be members of him, nourished with his proper
virtue, and that he himself is our food.

22 Too this end (I believe) that our sovereign doctor Jesus Christ, after
he had supped with his Disciples, and celebrated the ceremony of the Pascal
lamb according to ye law, to show unto the people and all the Church to come,
a lively representation of the conjunction which he took with his members by
mean of the sacrifice of his death, resurrection and glorification: He took
bread, and having given thanks to God his father, he brake it, and distributed
it to his Disciples, saying: Take, eat, this is my body which is delivered
for you: And after he took the cup and said: This is the cup of the new
Testament, take and drink you all, and do this in memory of me: that is as
much as if he should say, to the end you understand what I am on your
behalf, what remedy I bring unto you, Interpretation of the words of Christ
in the Supper.
what conjunction it is necessary you have with me, and I with you: know ye
that I am bread broken, offered, and sacrifised for the satisfaction of your
sins, which bread as I am my self, so it is needful that it be in you,
and give you heavenly nouriture even as the material bread gives you
corporal releef. And touching the Cup, understand you, that the same does
show you the new Testament and confederation which I practice with you, the
which testament shall be ratified with my blood, and do this in memory of me:
that is to say, when you shall break the bread, as I do, have remembrance
that you certify and assure your selves that you be mine, and I am youres,
yea youres in such sort, as the bread is youres which you break, eat, and
digeste, and the Wine which gives you nouriture.

23 Now (brethren) I beseech you in the name of our redemer Jesus, consider
without affection, if the interpretation of this holy Ceremony and of these
words be true or not: If it be true, to what purpose do we search so many
questions, so many subtilties, so many vbiquities, with other like inventions
to entertain the world in blyndenesse? To what purpose do we trouble the people
with visible ceremonies, with persuasio^ yt by that mean they may receive
Jesus Christ? We leave behind us, alas, and (as it were) altogether buried,
the doctrine of penance, Justification, regeneration, Sanctification,
mortification of the old Adam, and charity The spirit of god is not linked to
outward ceremonies.
of one to an other, things most important and necessary, and in the mean
while we employ and bestow our selves and time in the interpretation of certain
ceremonies, without the which, god is of power to show us that which they do
teach us. We know also that many holy men be deceased very devoutly, having
received Christ, without receiving the external signs and visible elements of
the supper. And to what end would it serve The receuing of the sacraments
serve nothing to such as will not receive Christ.
me to eat all the bread which is in Almayne, given by ye hands of the
ministers with the words of the supper of Christ, if I have not experienced my
renuyng, if I have not tasted my regeneration, if I be not certified that God
has reconciled me with him and received me to his mercy, and yt by such
feeling or taste I do not assure my self to have received Jesus Christ?

24 This is the doctrine, this (say I) is the preaching which we ought to
preach and repreache, repeat, and remember always to the people, restore to
the minds of the ignorant, and propounde to those that come to learn of us,
not by the subtilties of the right hand of God, vbiquities, and such like
imaginations. This is a thing very miserable in our time, that those which
speak of the communication of Jesus Christ, be such as least prove such a
communication in themselves, a thing to be seen by their writings, for they
speak of Jesus Christ, either shut within an armorie, or enclosed in past
within bread, under the bread, or with the bread, or from us by.xiiij. or xv.
thousand journeys, as though the true Temple of Jesus Christ, is any other
thing than the heart of a faithful man, and he that sercheth it without, shall
both lose his pains and remain frustrate of his hope.

25 Let us speak (my brethren) of Jesus Christ and his communication, as
people proving and feeling in our selves what it is to be nourished in our
consciences and souls, with the presence and virtue of ye same, otherwise to
what use will serve us our subtle interpretatio^s and particular declarations
which we bring forth? In the end, the world is not so blind, but they can
and will understand and find, that we are rather led by a spirit of stomach
than of the true zeal of Gods glory, in the end every one will see that
those preachers search no other thing than to mainteyne them selves in the
friendship of the world.

26 But now to return to the confirmation of the understanding that we The
understanding of the words of the holy Supper.
have given to this place of the holy Supper, let us consider, that if in all
things that Christ our Lord has propounded to manifest the necessity that
we have to be in him and he in us, we should search a presence corporal and
fleshly, it should be (as who say) never to come to end: for in the old
Testament Christ has bin propounded to us in diverse creatures, as a lamb,
Manna, Water, Stone, Table, meat, bread, feasts, and other things, as may be
seen by such as read the holy Scripture. He him self in his preachings
does call him a way, a door, bread of children, a vine, with other like
things. Note the absurdity of the false interpretation of the words of the
Supper.
Now, if in place where Christ said: I am the door, who enters not by me
shall not be saved: he had said this, I am he, showing with his finger a door,
shall we say for all that yt Christ has transformed or transubstanciate him self
into the matter of a door: if our redeemer in place where he said, I am the
vine and you are the branches, had said, this am I, showing Note the
interpretation of these words.
the vine, and that are you, handlyng the branches, could we say for all that,
that Jesus Christ would comunicate his substance into a grape, and that the
Apostles should be transnatured into branches? sure who were of such opinion,
discovered sufficiently his ignorance and infirmity.

27 Notwithstanding, (you others my brethren) make your principal pillar upon
such manner of speakings, and all to make the poor ignorant people believe
that Christ has made promise to give himself with the bread, because that
having taken bread, and breaking it, he said this is my body: which words
(simply understood) are as much as to say, my body which is broken, offered,
delivered, and sacrifised for you, is bread, or like too this bread which you
break, eat and digest for the nouriture of your body: In like sort, I being
the heavenly bread, shall be broken for you, to ye end you may have spiritual and
eternal life: therefore do and celebrate this, yt is to say, this breaking and
receite of bread in remembrance of me.

28 To make conclusion of this matter, I understand that our redeemer Jesus is

the fruit of life, who having put himself on the tree of the Cross, has
defaced the sin and transgression, which the fruit of the tree defended
brought to us: And even as Adam, having eaten of such a fruit, did make
himself enemy of God: in contrary manner, when we participate with Jesus
Christ crucified, we are received into the good favor and love of our
Heavenly Father, and that by the only bounty, merit, and intercession of the
self he, who on the tree of the cross did constitute himself the fruit of
life for us, being assured that the participation of that precious Fruit is not
done either by water, wine, bread, or any other creature whatsoever, but by the
work and operation indicible of the holy spirit, who having called the chosen
and predestinate of God, does teach them their Mean to receive Christ.

sins and abominable transgressions by mean of the presentation of the
holy Law, he shows unto them their damnation and sentence of eternal
death, the which they feel so in their hearts, that by experience they may
well assure them selves, that the ire and wrath of God has bin so manifested
to them, that they have swallowed pangs of death, and The true preparation to
know Christ is to know the necessity we have of him.
seen before their eyes the throat of hell confound and devour them: there
they find the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: they sorrow
and weep with a penance most bitter the miserable bankets or repasts which
they have taken of such a meat and fruit, not only in the person of their
father Adam, but also with their proper mouth.

29 After that by such means, the holy spirit has abased the arroga^cie of
man, his pride and presumption, and showed him by experience the diffinitiue
sentence and arest irreuocable of the eternal against sinners, he begins to
comfort and give him good hope, showing him (as a far off) The faithefull feel

the Tree of life, and the viuifying fruit hanging upon it, the which by
little and little, degree and degree, faith and faith, and virtue and virtue,
makes him eat, swallow and digest the heavenly bread Jesus Christ, yea with
such experience and feeling, that no meat in the world of how great nouriture
soever it be, is so sensible in the body, as the fruit of life (Jesus Christ)
is in the souls of the faithful, with such manifestation by good works
outwardly, that others may see and know with what meat they be fed.

30 For when we eat of every other The life of a christian shows that he
has Christ in him.
meat, the body of him that eats proves only the presence of the meat. But
in such as eat Christ, the true fruit of the tree of life, is discerned such
an example in their persons, such joy and patience in afflictions, such care to
mortify the old Adam, such a renu^ciation of the things of the world, with
affection to the life eternal, that their neighbors and friends acompanying
them, may see that they eat other meat than the deuourers of ceremonies do.

31 When they have truly, essentially, and really participated of the body
and blood of Christ (by faith as is said) of Jesus Christ, all entier, true
God, and true man, they assure them selves of such a conjunction with him,
that they have no need to go to search him, either in ye armorie of Preests,
or between the hands of men, too receive him either with the bread or with the
water, as being fully assured that Jesus Christ dwells in them, and that they
be flesh of his flesh, and bones of his bones.

32 And yet for all this, they forbear not to aproch to the holy table of the
Lord to celebrate the holy Supper with their brethren and children of the same
heavenly father: Neither go they thither to receive Christ of new in bread or
in wine, by grace or merit: but their first cause of going thither is, to
certify to all the church that they are of the number of those yt receive Jesus
Christ for their only redeemer and savior, for their eternal sacrificator,
their chief king, lord, souerain prophet and doctor to teach them in all truth.

33 Secondly, they take the holy supper as a gage and assurance of the good will
of the heavenly father toward the^, the same being so constant and firm, that
it will never change. For even as God has promised by oath, that the
sacrificator shall be eternal, even so shall be the sacrificature and sacrifice
for expiation of our sins.

34 Thirdly, they receive in ye Supper the seal of ratification and
confirmation of grace, with reco^ciliation prononou^ced by the preaching of ye
gospel, to the end yt by such mean, faith might be augmented in them, seeing yt
God is not only contented to give them y^ word of reconciliation, to assign his
promises with ye blood of his proper son, but has also signed and sealed his
Gospel of reconciliation with seals declaring in a wonderful manner, ye very
things contained in the letters patentes and promis of the gospel and happy
news.

35 Fourthly, the faithful see in the holy Supper, as in a table and lively
portrait, the communion and participation which they have inwardly in their
hearts with Jesus Christ, knowing also yt all the noriture and spiritual vigor
which they see in the^ comes of the presence of him whom they consider and
behold figured and represented in the holy and sacred Ceremony of the Supper:
by mean of which consideration, they render thanks to the Lord Sacrifice of
thanks giving in the holy Supper.
for the faith, hope, mortification, and constancy which they feel to be
communicated to them by the power and benignity of him that dwells in them.
And by this mean, their faith being augmented, they participate more and more
with Jesus Christ once received.

36 Finally they learn in the holy supper, the unity and charity which we
Confirmation and augmentatio^ of Christ received in the Supper.
ought to have one with an other: And seeing we protest in the receite of the
holy Sacrament to be one body and one church, members of one sovereign head
Jesus Christ, it is good reason also that we learn to imitate the Sympathia and
mutual compassion which we see daily in our human bodies, whereof if one
of our arms be hurt, the other serves and comfort it, the feet refusing
their proper office to march and go, are content to The holy Supper representes
unto us a brotherly charity of one to another.
keep themselves in bed, to the end the arm being hurt may be in rest, the
stomach is satisfied with a slender repaste, to the end to ease that part that
is distressed: in effect, every one of the outward and inward members, do so
acco^modate their office and function to the ease and comfort of the hurt
place, that in them may be noted a wonderful harmony and league of one part
with an other, the same also being lively represented and expressly recomme^ded
unto us in the celebration of the holy Supper of the Lord, to the end that
every one of us, may with most diligent care, labor to preserve the unity of
the body of Christ, and supporting one an other, may learn to cover the faults
of our brethren, pardon their wrongs, not to rebuke and exaggerate too much
their ignorances, but rather to interpret them to the best, and to teach them
with charity. Let us learn in the celebration of the holy sacrament, to make
us partakers of the afflictions and persecutions of our brethren, whom we
confess in the receipt of the supper too be the members of Christ with us.

37 Behold here (in effect my dear brethren) one part of the spiritual fruits
that the children of God receive in the receite of the Supper of our Lord
truly admynystred and simply understood, knowing right well that Christ had
no other meaning in the institution of those sacraments, than to manifest by
visible words (as Saint Augustine says) the good will of God toward men,
that is, to purge, wash, and make them clean by the water of his grace, and
by the blood of his propre son, to conioyn, knit, and incorporate them with
him, even as the meat is made one thing with our flesh, in such sort that eue^
as in the exterior preaching of the gospel the Lord does offer and present to
all the world the benefit of reconciliation by Christ, in like manner the
sacraments be as a table or open shop, wherein the benignity, mercy and
charity of our God, be exposed to every one, offered and represented lively in
the tables: And miserable shall they be, who not serching the life and lively
refection and true washing within, do embrace the corruptible and deceiuable
elements, and double miserable shall they be, who naming themselves Doctors of
the truth, and pastors of the troop of God, would feed the souls of their
sheep with meats that will perish and corrupt.

38 But now to return to our purpose begone, I took occasion (my dear beloved
The occasion of the writing of this sermon.
brethren) to write you these few lines, as seeing ye small fruit of my request
on your behalf, when I spoke to Monsieur Mathias Yllyricus, who, was said to be
the Superintendent of your church, with who^ I persuaded very modestly to show
unto you, and consider himself the infancy of this church, persecuted and
thretned on every side, assailed with many enemies, and battred with diversity
of opinions, with advise besides, that the time was more proper to preach and
teach to the people the faith and hope which we ought to use to mortify
our wicked affections, with a regard of care to enterteine the league of
charity one with an other, tha^ to impart with the simple and ignorant sort
such debates and questions, as we have raised upon the matter of our
confessions: Seeing withal, that such dissentio^s are rather pronounced of a
iolitie of the heart to prefer our eloquence, and procure to our selves a
peculiar estimation amongst men, than of purpose necessary for the edificatio^
of our piety: which albeit he seemed to like of, with a disposition to admit
and perform my requests, yet contrarily, I see he is either the author or
instigatour of a confession of faith which you have set a broach in this
church of Antwerpe: in which confession, I can not only find any one point of
ye three mentioned in my conference with him, but also it seems to certain,
that you have raised this confession expressly to trouble this poor afflicted
church. The Lord of his goodness give you true knowledge and repentance of
that which you do: for touching the chief point of our Religion, that is to
say, Faith, I find not in your confession many texts nor places which kindle
the heart of man to embrace the doctrine of Jesus Christ. A thing which I
could easily appointe with my finger, if I would as vainly employ my time in
confutation, as I see a number do at this day in disputation: only I thank
GOD, that by other means he has taught me the doctrine of his truth: for if
at my first arrival, I had encountered your confession of faith, to learn me
to be a christian, I could not have much profited in a lesson of faith so full
of questions, debates, and dissentions.

39 Dear brethren, if you will with judgment read over that, which your
author has written in your name, you shall find, that neither Scotus nor any
other Sophisters of the Papists, have so much endarkned the doctrine of Jesus
Christ, nor clad it with so many questions, as certain of you have done:
whereof (for example) let us survey briefly four certain points, and that more
to reveal the slender edification that their readers may hope for of such
lessons, than to encomber our selves with the confutation of such vanities.
Read the Articles of the confession of faith of Yllyric, the better to
understand the articles following.


40 Touching that which you say of our inheritance of the original sin,
and free will lost, the world it self does declare well enough at this day,
that every one has gotten a good lump of the inheritance of the corruption of
Adam, and the original sin as they call it, neither do your wrytings
dispense or discharge you of your part thereof. And I believe (as you say)
that men now a days have not any Free will, seeing it may be further
believed, that there be a great many that have slender sense and well worse
understanding, as being altogether ruled and carried over by their affections.

41 Touching the matter of the incarnation of the son of GOD, and redemption
of man, I could well have pardoned you the obmyssyon of the subtle questions
you use therein, searching curiously the house wherein Christ dwells. Item,
what make we of ascension? or the signification of this word heaven? or the
right hand of God? so that you would teach us the true mean to receive Jesus
Christ into our selves, seeing it pleases him, in respect of his goodness,
too make his dwelling in the hearts of the faithful and regenerate. Otherways
of what use is Jesus Christ to us being so far from the heart of man as you
make him? B. 4.

42 Touching your place of justifying faith, I understand not your language,
where you say that only faith, by mean whereof we take (as of a hand) the
benefit of Jesus Christ too obtain justification, regeneration and health:
and immediately after you say, that by the Sacraments, are imputed and applied
too us the Justice and merit of Jesus Christ. B. 4.

43 In the doctrine of justification you say it is a most hard question to
know what is that true justice which makes us just and agreeable to God,
with atteinement of eternal life: but I had rather that without so many
arguments, confutations, and subtilties, you had showed to the poor and
ignorant people, what is the christian justice, and by what mean she is given
to us. B. 5.

44 Touching the point of good works you say that ye works which me^ ought to
call good, are those which God demau^ds in his word, and yt those which be
regenerat and guided by the spirit of God, are they which show the fruits of a
good Tree: I believe it well, and conclude upon your saying, that who has not
zeal, love, charity, who suffers not all things with patience, takes every
thing in the best part, covers the faults of his neighbor, and labors
not to put peace in place of dissentio^, can not have regeneration. And
touching the rest of your questions, whether good woorks concur in
justification, as a cause formal or efficient, the simple people has not to
do, contenting themselves with this belief, that regeneration and faith without
good works is a mere hypocrisy and thing dead, and that it is necessary, that
our new obedience serve as witness of our reconciliation and justification.

45 Now (dear brethren) as I am void of intent herein either to examine or
exaggerate the newness of your confession, and much less to confute it by
arguments, so I will leave to the consideration of the Reader, your excuse in
cutting off the commandment of the living God under pretext of certain
gloses and distinctions unworthy to be uttered: for here we do not dispute
whether the commandment not too make any images of veneration, be a
commandment particular, or an appendix of an other, whether it be ceremonial
or moral: but we will here maynteine that it is an audacitie most cursed to
cut off from the law of our God any one word, seeing specially that that
sum and content of commandment is so short and compendious, that it
contains but ten commandments, the which if God would have abridged, he
knew better how to do it than we, and therefore such as undertake to correct his
style and accuse him of prolixitie, give sufficient proof of their abominable
temeritie.

46 But let us now come to the principal point of your debate and ancient
question, the which upon a bravery you seem to renew upon every purpose and
place, without having respect to the great slander of those that be weak.
First you utter the sum of your confession of the Supper in these words: The
opinion of Mathias Yllyricus and his companions touching the Supper.
Credimus igitur Christo affirmanti, quod corpus and sanguis eius vere ac
realiter in sacra Coena adsit, deturque externo modo accipiendum cum pane and
vino, non fide tantum, aut spiritualiter, idque tam ab indignis, quam a dignis
sumatur, and contraria docentes, cum Augustana confessione consentiendo,
damnamus. That is to say: We believe in Christ who assures us that his body
and blood be truly and really in the sacred supper, and that it is given us in
taking it outwardly with the bread and wine, not only with faith and
spiritually: the which body is eaten as well of the unworthy, as of those that
be worthy: And those that shall teach the contrary, we (stickyng to the
Confession of Auspurge) do condemn them.

47 See here (my brethren) your goodly entry of ye article of your Supper,
which we may, not improperly, liken to that of the new inquisitors, who
condemn, anathematize, excommunicate, and call Heretics, and confounders of
ye church, all those which receive not their confession, which me think you
do also as of purpose to maynteyne youres of Auspurge, as though it were a
fyfth Gospel or new Symbol of the Creed. What shall we say (brethren) too
these matters? have you no shame that men of good judgment and understanding,
should read such haultie and rash words? Who are they that have set the
author of the Confession of Auspurge, or that of yours in such authority or
degree of the Church, tht they may pronounce Sentence of damnation ageynste
such as will not admit their interpretation upon a place or Text of the
Scripture? What is he of any judgment at all, who will not fear to forsake
the tyranny of the Papists, to enter into an other, almost of like condition?
We call the Pope Antechryst, tyrant and butcher of men's consciences, because
that without liberty to hear men speak, he condemns and excommunicates
them, and yet your doings are nothing inferior to his cruelty, in pronouncing
condemnation, not only against your enemies, but also against such as you
receive for your brethren and companions in the work of the Lord, and who
no less for the duty of Christians, than to take away the slander from the
Church of Christ, do search by all their possible means too live in love
and friendship with you.

48 I could willingly say to the author of your confession, as the Apostle
says: my brother, my friend, what art thou that Romans 14.
condemns the servants of an other? Who has given thee such power? Art thou
his redemer? Art thou his judge? Art thou he in the name of whom he has bin
baptized? Has he not a master, who, if he fall will raise him agein, and has
the power to do it? But of what purpose are these words, when we find our
hearts so hardened, that we feel not at all the very chastisements, which God
lets fall upon our heads.

49 Let us mark and consider what miserable issues our prechings, confessions,
wrytings, and commentaries, bring forth: Let us also behold what fruits are
brought to our audience by our words, what reformation of life in our
churches, wherein reign still wa^to^nesse, lubricities, gluttonies,
drunkenness, usury, deceits, with a thousand such like vices, which we let
pass, making our selves many times (by winking) companions to those that
commit them, swallowing (as our Savior Christ says) the Camels, and after
passing by the cloutes the little gnats, which means that we pronounce
condemnation against such who pierce not the subtilties of our interpretations
in Christ's Supper: making small reckening of the crimes and dissolutio^s which
are committed daily before our eyes I pray you what may mean so many sorts of
co^munications of Christ, the one physical, Yllyricus in the text of his
admonition makes. 4. sorts of communications of Christ.
and an other mystical, an other spiritual, and an other sacramental,
together also with those which you put in your confession, the one common both
to the good and to the evil, when they say, this is my body, and the other,
when they say, Do this in remembrance of me. Those with such like
co^munications of Christ, we never learned in the word of God, but of the
contrary, we know for truth that there is but one mean to receive Jesus
Christ, and have communication with him, that is to say, lively faith, and
that accompanied with repentance and Mean to receive Christ by only faith.
penance of our sins passed, and newness of life to come. I would to God we
were well taught and exercised in this manner of communicatio^ of Christ: for
touching the rest, what assurance may we take of the doctrine of your
article, which is not drayned out of the word of God, but rather of the
interpretations of men? I pray you show me where it is that Christ
affirms, that his body and blood be truly and really in the bread, under
the bread, or within the bread of the Supper, and that he gives himself to
be eaten exteriorly with the bread and wine, the same being not done not
only by Faith, or spiritually, but that he is eaten as well of the unworthy as
those that be worthy.

50 Me thinks (dear brethren) that, seeing you will be esteemed so diligent in
the observation of the words of the scripture, as preferring nothing which is
not drawn out of the same, it is necessary you know, that in all your article
there is not one word of the words of Christ: but we What conjunction between
Christ and Behall.
know that both he himself and his apostle teaches us the contrary, saying,
that the unbelieving and unworthy can not 2. Cor. 6.
possess Christ, nor be members of him, seeing they have not a mouth of faith
to receive him.

51 Besides, I see that your very confession does not accord at all, with that
of Auspurge, whereof you make so great a buckler, no less to maynteyne you in
the good opynion of the world, than to bring your selves in, under the
protection of princes and potentates, who at the beginning, used very wisely
and christianlye the presentation of this Confession. For the words of the
Author be these, Article. 10. De Coena Domina docent, quod cum pane and vino
vere exhibeantur corpus et sanguis Christi, vescentibus in coena domini, that
is to say: Touching the Supper of the Lord, they teach, that with the bread
and wine be exhibited the body and blood of Christ, to those that eat the
Supper of the Lord.

52 In these words the Confession of Auspurge make no mention to receive the
body of Christ really and exteriorly, as you say in youres, neither make they
mention at all that the worthy and unworthy do receive it.

53 But hereunto you say, that we have not the true and incorrupte confession
of Auspurge, but that you have certain Copies and exemplaries thereof best
corrected, which you follow in your doctrine: is it possible (brethren) you
should be so negligent in the correction of your confession whereof you make so
great value? I am not of opinion that the princes Protestants would suffer to be
printed in their towns, articles of their confession, contaminated and
imperfect: truly you trouble greatly the world: for if those which follow not
your confession, be condemned by your sentence, and you only have the true
copy of this confession, we must the^ necessarily come to you as to a spring
or fountain of truth and health: some may say (as in derision of those things,)
that we must come on pilgrimage to search your registers and bookeshops, as
in times past they went to Ierusale, Rome, or S. James, Oh good God, what
mockery, what presumption of people? But, to prevent you of cause of
complainte against us, and that your inco^sideration be more manyfestly
discovered, we will recite the article of your incorrupt confession, which as
you say to be reserved with you, so you shall find it bears not a word of
that which you have uttered.

54 Your words be these: Sequimur igitur in hac controuersia sententiam
decimi articuli Augustanae confessionis: porro articulus See the confession. H.
2.
ille decimus ita habet in incorrupta confessione, quam sequimur: De coena
Domini docent, quod corpus and sanguis Christi vere adsint, and distribuantur
vescentibus in Coena domini: and improbant secus docentes. That is to say: We
follow in this question and debate, the advice and sentence of the tenth
Article of the Confession of Auspurge, which tenth article is written in this
sort, in the confession which we follow, which is not corrupted: It is
taught, touching the supper of the Lord, that the body and blood of Christ be
truly present, and be distributed to such as eat in the Supper of the Lord,
neither are they approved which teach other ways.

55 Now (brethren) I pray you show me where it is that you find here your
realities, and vbiquities, or that the unworthy do eat the body of Christ,
with other sorts of doctrines which you have preferred, and would authorize
them with the confession of Auspurge, which notwithstanding, we will not
receive as a rule of our Christianity, and much less the Confession of any
other man that is upon earth.

56 We will be christians, and so be called, we will follow the confession of
faith, which our GOD the father, and Jesus Christ his Son have left unto
us: that is too say, the dyuyne word in the old and new Testament, as the
sum of our Religion: We receive the simbols of faith received of old time
in the Church: we have not bin baptized in the names of Martine, Zwinglius, or
Caluyn, but in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost: by which
means, we deteste and abhor all those names and surnames of Partialities,
that is to say, Martinistes, Zwinglians, and Caluinists, with other like,
knowing very well that GOD is greatly displeased with such separations and
partialities in the doctrine of religion: And I wish with all my heart, that the
doctors which have taught here before, and such as at this day do preach
the Gospel, were of more modesty and wisdom, and purely consecrated to search
the glory of the Lord, and not their own proper praise: then should the
people be in more liberty of conscience, and the worshippers of one only
God, and not of mortal men, ignorant and blind, who, making them selves as
Idols, do desire to be followed and holden in great admyration: I would in
God that every one would say with Saint John the Baptist, it is meet that
Jesus Christ be exalted and magnified, and that I be diminished and unknown:
it is to Jesus Christ, to whom we ought to send the poor souls, desirous to
find knowledge and justice, and not to your confessions, institutions,
catechismes, or commentaries.

57 For the rest (brethren) you seem to complain of the great diversity of
interpretation that many have pronounced upon the words of the Supper, which
partly I can not deny, because many desirous to make their church apart, do
raise a value or estimation of them selves among their audience, with pretense
to celebrate their own names: from whence it proceeds, that having but one
truth, and one simple intelligence in the words of Christ, all such as digress
from the same, to use some strange and new order, do every one bring into the
church his innovation.

58 But I beseech you consider, whether amongst those that receive the tenth
article of the confession of Auspurge, there be any diversity of
interpretation, to the end that if you will have all the world (for the
eschuing of the condemnation of your sentence) to follow your confession, you
first labor to establish an accord amongst your selves, and then every one
will deliberate upon that he has to do. For you being divided amongst your
selves, and of diverse opinions, we are ignorant in the part we ought to follow
to escape your condemnation. They of the Confession of Auspurge agree not
amongst themselves upon the words of the Supper. Read the book named
Antithese, of the true and false exposition of the tenth Article of the
Confession of Auspurge, the Author of the same is Sybran Andreas.


59 First you know well that Mathias Yllyricus, whom I think to be the author
of your confession, is not of opinion with those that have composed and
presented the confession of Auspurge, and you and he are not ignorant of the
contentions, debates and discentions, which be even till this day between him
and others: All which I will not here repete, because my intent is not, to
kindle the coals of dissension, but rather to quench them, I will not bring
to light the faults of others, but rather cover and hyde them, albeeit it is
easy for every man to see, both how things have passed, and how they are
now used, and that by Books that are printed. Touching the dissension of M.
Yllyricus with Ph. Melancthon, and those of the Confession of Auspurge, read
the Epistles of Melancthon in many places, but chiefly the page. 452. Also the
Acts Synodals imprinted in the year. 1559. Also the answers given to the
Legate of Saxon by Ph. Melancthon.


60 Touching the breaking and brusing of bread, you see I am sure, that in
this town of Antwerpe, the Ministers be not of accord. I leave aparte the
truth of the Question, which you call indifferent, notwithstanding that the
institution of the Lord bears by manifest words, the breaking of the bread.
S. Paul calls ye holy Supper the breking of bread, which also all the
ancient church do approve: And for my part, I am of opinion that in the
ceremony of the holy Supper, the breaking of bread ought to be observed,
as signifying and assuring to us that Jesus Christ was offered broken for us:
for the rest, as when Christ celebrated the supper, whether the bread he had
then between his hands, was great Seek the confession. K. 10. and. 11.
or little, I leave the decision of that question to Monsieur Mathias
Yllyricus, who says that Jesus Christ in the Supper, brake the bread, because
the cakes were too great, and he had not made provision of little waffernes as
we use, so that necessity forced him to break the bread without having
intent to teach us any thing by the breaking of the bread.

61 The Churches of the most noble prince elector and County Palatyne,
receive the confession of Auspurge, and yet in your Catechism you teach that
the unfaithful and unworthy do not eat the body of Christ in the Sacrament,
the which is against your article, and consequently against the confession of
Auspurge.

62 The diuins of the renoumed prince of Hesse have received the confession of
Auspurge, and yet Andreas Hyperius doctor of the university of Marpurge,
belongyng to the said Prince, received the Confession presented by the
Strangers out of the town of Weasell, against which confession Heshussius his
companions and yours, have raised many debates, to banish from the country
such as followed the said confession, the same arguing manifestly, that you and
your companions be not of accord with the churches of the said prince.

63 Johannes Pincerus, a man learned and no less devout as you know, albeit
he received the confession of Auspurge, writ notwithstanding, a book against
the said Heshussius, refuting the opinions of the Supper, and other things, the
which Heshussius names him self to be of the confession of Auspurge, and
your adherent and confederate to maynteyne this dissension.

64 In the year 1565. The right noble prince elect of Saxon, presented to the
university of Wittemberge, the writings of Brentius and James Andreas, as upon
meaning to examine them touching their opinion of the Supper, whereunto the
university answered, that the said Brentius and Andreas, used in this matter
diverse and sundry orders of speech, both new, dangerous, and altogether
unknown to the ancient Church, that is to say, that the humanity of Christ
was dispersed into every place: that the humaniti-of Christ was Creator of
all things, that James Andreas confounded the communication of languages or
propreties in the person of Christ, and that they feared that the university
of Tubinga and the church of Wittenburgh were troubled with these innouations
of doctrine, exhorting them to cease from such disputations, with contentment
only to believe that the words of Christ be true, when he says, this is my
body. Now my brethren, what part I pray you, should we follow, seeing both
the one and the other be of the confession of Auspurge?

65 Paul Eberus denies expressly, that the unworthy eat the flesh of
Christ, who being of the confession of Auspurge, does neither agree with you,
nor yet with Brentius, who mainteyneth, that Judas (in the Supper) did as well
receive the body of Christ, as S. John, or S. Peter.

66 The eight article of the confession of Auspurge, does teach, that the
unfaithful are not members of the church, and therefore receive not but the
outeward signs of the Supper. So that when you say that the unworthy receive
the body of Christ, you are there contrary to your own proper confession. I
pray you what conjunction is there between light and darkness? What
aquaintance between Jesus Christ and Belyal? No, let us rather remember and
reteyne that which the Prophet says, that God loves not the wicked nor their
wickedness, neither shall the ungodly dwell with him.

67 Phillip Melancthon, author of the confession of Auspurge, in the apology
of the same confession does teach, that the participation of the body of Christ
is received of the faithful by the meditation of his benefits: then to receive
Christ, it is not needful too gnawe him or break him with our teeth. Besides,
the wicked which have no meditation, nor godly recordation of the benefits of
Christ, although they chaw the bread, yet can they not receive Christ by the
saying of the same Author, to whom your doctrine is contrary in this point.

68 Martine Luther has bin esteemed a good interpreter and understander of the
confession of Auspurge, and yet he says that the very juice and mary of the
holy Supper, is to receive an assurance of the remission of our sins by the
sacrifice of Christ. Those then that say that the unfaithful and unworthy
receive the body of Christ, which is the juice and marow of the sacrament, be
contrary to the said doctor: and by consequent, to the confession of Auspurge,
the which you do in your Article.

69 The Duke of Wittenburgh, wylleth and means that his confession agree with
that of Auspurge, and yet the article of the Supper in his confession is
interpreted by the words of Ezechiell, saying, this Quarey or tyle is the town
of Ezech. 4.
Jerusalem etc. That is to say, does signify or mean the town of Jerusalem
etc. Who then will not receive this place in the interpretation of the Supper,
disagreeth with the confession of the said prince, and by consequent, with that
of Auspurge, amongst whom is Kemnitius, who reiects wholly this place in the
matter of the sacraments.

70 Touching this word (unworthy) and who ought to be called so, you be not of
accord: for Heshussius your companion, with large arguments goes about to
prove that the faithful cannot any way be called unworthy. Kemnitius (in the
contrary) mainteineth that the place of S. Paul treating of the unworthiness
of such as receive the Supper, ought to be understood and interpreted by the
other place of the Gospel, where the Centurio^ says, that he is not worthy
that Jesus Christ enter intoo his house, as ye ancient doctors have
interpreted it. Which of these shall we believe, seeing they be of contrary
opinyon, and yet both the one and other folowers of the confession of Auspurge?

71 The.xiij. Article of the confession of Auspurge, teaches that the lauful
use of the Sacrament demands necessaryly Faith, without which use, the
Sacrament is no Sacrament. Those then which have not faith in the
administration of your Supper, have not also, neither sacrament nor body of
Christ, and therefore the Communion that the unworthy do make, resistes your
own confession.

72 The.xxj. article of the confession of Auspurge says, that for the
difference of ceremonies and traditions of men, a man ought not to accuse the
other churches, and much less condemn them of error, nor call them
adversaries, who are of a contrary opinion: And yet you (my brethren) call the
other Ministers of this church, adversaries, enemies, and people cut off from
your company, because they do not bliss at the altar the bread before they do
distribute it, with observation of other ceremonies that are of custom in your
Supper.

73 Touching this word (with) when you say the body of Christ is received
with the bread, you are not of accord: for certain of your confession affirm
that Christ is enclosed within ye bread, others, upon the bread, others, as
the fire within the hot water, others, as the fire with in the burning iron,
others, as the grange or house within the letters or words of contract: in
effect, who would recite all the similituds and interpretations which they of
the confession of Auspurge, have made upon the words of the supper, and all to
maynteine the doctrine of the presence of Christ linked with the exterior
elements, should find the discourse long, and the matter of small purpose. In
the end, John Alasco, superintendent of the Church of London, being in the
Church of Franckefort, and seeing such dissentions tending rather too dissolve
the unity of the Church, than to redress it, is of opinion, that, that
word of the confession of Auspurge, where Christ is received with the bread,
signifies, that when the faythefull eat the bread in the Supper with their
corporal mouth, their spirit with the mouth of Faith receives Jesus Christ,
which is on the right hand of GOD. And such interpretation of this word
(with) was received of the Senate of the town of Franckefort, as a declaration
agreeing with the confession of Auspurge, whereby the poor strangers which
are withdrawn thither, lived in peace and quiet, until by reason of other
quarrels, this Question was eftsoons renewed, by which mean they became in
effect, the cause of the dissipation of so flourishing a Church. There be
also amongst you that say, that the body of Christ is present in the
Supper, as Jesus crucified, was present to the eyes of the Galathians, and as
the day of Christ was present too Abraham: and yet are they received intoo
the company of those which maynteyne the Confession of Auspurge. And because
Heshusius, being at the university of Hidelbergh, made himself enemy to this
interpretation, and troubled the church with debates and questions, it is said,
he was banished from ye said university, like as diverse have already put in
writing many things belongyng to this dissension, and others which we have
mentioned.

74 Behold (brethren) one chief occasion much hindering many men to embrace
the true religion, and to bring the^ selves into your assembly, as seeing
amongst you so great diversity of opinions. And for your parts, touching
the matter of the Sacraments, you pursue them so eigerly, so sharply, and with
such animositie and stomach, that the very blind themselves discern in you,
more desire to obtain victory, than zeal of God to instruct your ignorant
brother. For when we have a direct will toward our neighbor, with a lively
touch of compassion of his ignorance, and have a christian desire to manifest
unto him the truth, we do not proceed by injuries, excomunications, nor
condemnations, the same being in deed the very effects and motions of a
contentious and arrogant spirit, with a mind full of felony. But of the
contrary, we use sweet and soft words of induceme^t, with persuasions of
modesty, as knowing assuredly, that man is a kind of creature so fierce of
stomach, as he is not to be qualified otherwise than by gentle admonishment,
and specially in the case and question of his religion, which having her true
foundation in the bottom of his heart, it is impossible to plant persuasions of
Religion before we have overcome and gained that place with gentle allurements,
and then with fruit, to plant there the doctrine of faith. Besides also, you
labor us greatly to enter into disputation in this church upon the point of
the Supper, which we will not refuse, so that it may be done in good order and
with the consent of the state: we would also that you agree first amongst
your selves, too the end we might know what part to mainteyne: Wherein
albeeit I can not but fear, that your intent was rather to search matter of
triumph without victory, with occasion to send of your books to the next
fair of Frankefort, than of a zeal and pure affection to pacify this
afflicted church: toward which God grant us the zeal of his glory. And I pray
you, of what purpose would it be to us upon the disputation to agree with you:
seeing that by such means, we should fall into ye evil will of a great part of
the princes Protestants of Germany, who abhor already the opinions you have
uttered of the person of Christ too be in the presence of the Supper? by the
same mean also, we should make our selves companions and adherents to
Yllyricus, your Superintendent or author of your confession, who is hated of
the most noble Churches and Universities of Germany, and chiefly in
Wittenburgh, who has bin ye mother nourse of the first Protestants. These
things considered, I see neither order to dispute, nor reason to come to accord
with him and his adhere^ts.

75 The second point, wherein I requested Mathias Yllyricus and you too take
some pains, was, in the doctrine of mortyfication, a thing most necessary
for this lamentable time, wherein we see so many Epycures, so many
Libertines, so many Atheystes and people abandoned to all fylthynesse and
dissolution: of which so principal a matter you touch not one word in all
your confession, but rather with your unbridled order of proceeding, show to
the people great example of immortification. By the which, those that have
judgment in spiritual things, may see that your doctrine and Scripture is
not a doctrine taught by the Spirit of GOD, and received in his school: but
rather certain textes and propositions gathered out of the papers and Books
of others, who (peradventure) have proved better than we, that which they
have taught and left in writing.

76 The last part of my request to M. Yllyricus was, to exhort you to enterteyn
a charitable and loving unity, to the end all the church might be edified, as
well by the one as the other, which he has done quite contrary in your
confession, as witnesses ye words of the.xvij. article in this sort: Quod
aduersariorum coena impie celebretur. Si quis hactenus dubitauit, vtra
sente^tia sit verior in sacrame^taria controuersia, ille sane vel ex solis
ipsoru^ agendis ac formulis sacrae communionis, and ipsa praxi coenae statuere
haud difficulter poterit. Tantis enim corruptelis, sacrilegijs, in ta^
sacrosanctis mysterijs grassantur, vt citra horrorem ac tremorem eas
prophanationes pia men's cognoscere non possit. Eas igitur vastationes ac
violationes tanti mysterij hic breuiter exponemus, vt sibi pusilli Christi
cauere a tantis piaculis and ira Dei possint. Multis ergo modis eorum liturgia
impie peragitur. That is to say: If any by the things aforesaid be yet in
doubt, not knowing which is the truest opinion in the matter of the
sacraments, he may easily be certified of a truth, in beholding their actions
and ceremonies A sharp point of M. Yllyricus in his confession.
in the celebration of the communion: for there be so many corruptions and
sacrileges in so holy mysteries, that a Christian mind can not behold such
prophanations without horror and fear. We will then declare briefly in this
Epistle, the distructions and violations that are committed in so great a
mystery, to ye end the little ones of Christ may stand upon their guard
against such execrable crimes, but specially against their of God. Their
ceremony of the Supper The preachers of the confession of Auspurge accuse the
other ministers.
(that is to say, of the sacramentaries as you call them) is celebrated with
impiety in many sorts. First you say, that we make no benediction upon the
bread. Secondly, in that, that when we give the bread, we exhort those that
receive it to have remembrance of Jesus Christ broken, offered, and sacrificed
for our reconciliation to the heavenly father, and satisfaction of our sins
with the divine justice. Thirdly, because that in this, we seek to be
folowers of Jesus Christ, who celebrating the Supper, said to his disciples:
Take and eat. etc. Fourthly, you accuse us in that we forget in the Supper
the words of consecration. Fifthly, for that we pronounce not the words of
consecration, to the end the bread may perceive our voice, with understanding
of the word of God, conversion into the body of Christ. Sixtely, you accuse us
because we persuade the assistantes, not to settle their eyes upon the
consideration of the visible and exterior elements, but rather raise our minds
and consideration to Jesus Christ, the true heavenly bread for the nouriture of
our souls, who being already immortal, is glorified upon the right hand of
the Father. The seventh impiety which you say we commit, is, That we tell
the assistauntes that they take the bread and Wine in remembrance of Jesus
Christ. In the eight, you say we fail, in that we use the words of
Christ, saying: Take and eat, and have remembrance of Jesus Christ employed
for you, wherein according to your scoffs of custom and poetical sleightes,
you make us like to the Beguiars and Beguines, when they feed in their
repastes. The Lord pardon you such orders of teaching to your neighbors,
and reveal unto you the modest gravity which he demaundes in those that
profess themselves pastors of the sheep, and pronouncers of the gospel.
Ninthly, you blame us in that we do not counterfeit Jesus Christ as the priests
of the Papists do, as observing not point by point, and word by word, the
ceremonies that he made, and speak not in the same order the words which he
pronounced. Your tenth and last accusation is, in that (as you say) we rob
deceitfully the supper of the words of consecration, by mean whereof the body
of Christ ought to come thither, and yet we say to the assista^ts that they
receive the body of Christ.

77 Behold (dear brethren) one part of ye accusatio^s wherewith you have
charged us touching the matter of ye Supper, whereunto I will not answer, as
being things so vayn and of so small importance, that there is none
participating with either piety or godliness, which account not the time
lost, or at least evil employed in the debate of such things, for as the Lord
has made us once to understand (by his grace) what it is to receive Christ,
and that we have felt the fruits of his presence, so all your accusations
and Arguments of persuasions to the contrary, are but superfluous. And
therefore in place to make you answer, and fall into the fault which I see in
many, who do nothing in all the time of their life, but dispute and debate, I
will pray to that good God to give us all a grace of participation with his
light, which chaseth away all darkness of error and ignorance.

78 I pray you what fruit can proceed in writing a new book of the questions
and differences, that these.xxx. years have bin so sharply argued, and yet
without profit. Would it be any other thing than in causing to be reprinted
sundry repetitions, to fill the faires of Frankefort, and set the bookeprinters
on work? A vanity most great, and yet followed of many men of knowledge,
who, desirous by these means too borrowe themselves an estimation, wish that
the world knew that they have such a facility to compose books, that in one
evening after supper, they can write as many quaires, as may suffice a spedie
Printer too imprint in a week. Considering (alas) not at all, that the
devotion of a christian consists not in words, nor in the multitude of papers
and books, but in the true fear of God, accompanied with lively faith and
careful mortification, with study, by all our possible means to preserve the
league of charity one to an other, giving ye world to know, by our life and
example, that our confession is the better.

79 I could have wished (dear brethren) that where in your confession, you
have disgorged so many injuries at your pleasure, against such as desire your
wealth and honor, at the least that you had given a show of a christian
modesty. But it seems that in this uncharitable show, you had a desire to
declare an evident witness of the hate and evil will you bear against your
neighbors, and that without any just occasion in them: calling them
adversaries and enemies, profanors of the Supper of the Lord, and darkening
with corruption the words of S. Paul. You call them sacramentors, people that
know not what means the ascension of Christ, what is his right hand, nor
what is glorification of the humanity of the Lord, with other like things.

80 Let us leave, let us leave (good brethren) such manner of disputation, and
let us forget to maintain our own interpretation: yea let us search the
edification of the church of Christ, and not our own glory. Let us study
to lead men by our preachings to Jesus Christ our Sovereign Doctor, and not
to follow neither the confession of Auspurge, the Catechism of Martine, nor
the interpretations of John nor Peter. Let us make it known to all the princes
and potentates of Germany, that all those questions be banished, and we in
desire to live in reconciliation and friendship: And let not the weak have
occasion to say, that we serve most as matches and bellows, to kindle the
hearts of such personages, to make them show themselves enemies of those who
confess one self Gospel of Christ with the^.

81 Truly the doctors, pastors and ministers of the Gospel, ought to be such
now, as by word and writing, to become suitors to the Princes Protestants, to
take into their protection, and under their wings, the churches which the Lord
has stirred up in these low Countries, and that they may become humble
intercessoures to the king of Spain, our sovereign Magistrate, for pity over
his poor and most loyal subjects, who without any offense unto the majesty
of their Prince, be persecuted, murdered, afflicted as seditious and rebels,
and handeled with more cruelty than may be believed but of such as have
seen it.

82 In the mean while, we triumph in the chair, with bestowyng here and
there, captious Inuectyues, calling some Caluinistes, some Sacramentors, some
seditious and rebels, breakers of Images with other like. We send our
Confessyons stuffed with Injurious matters, debates, and quarrels, to the
Princes of Alm^yn, to the end they may see what valiant champions we are on
this side. And how (at the least) the Confession of Auspurge triumphs in the
town of Antwerpe by our means. In the which mean while, the glory of Jesus
Christ is buried, or altogether forgotten, and we have so hardened our hearts,
that the afflictions of our brethren and neighbors do not touch us at all,
but we hear them reckened, and reckon them our selves with scoffs and
mockery, thinking to escape better cheap, because we are covered with the
confession of Auspurge.

83 No no (brethren) it can not be so, for God knows how and where to find
us, though it be in the bottom of the sea: he has his arms so long, that he
is able to draw us from the lap of the greatest Monarchs of the earth. And
therefore let us not put our trust in the strength of the flesh, but rather
let us march with all fear before GOD, and search only his glory. And in
place to make factions and separations of the church, let us go with one
courage and heart to batter the kingdom of Satan, with the superstitions and
idolatries brought into our christian religion by him and his suppostes. Let
us make war against vices, and not against men, which be the creatures We
ought so to preach and write against the abuse of the papists with a christian
modesty.
of God (be they Papists or other) discovering so the abuses, as neither the
abusers nor they that be abused think, that we cry out against them rather by
injurious malice, than for a zeal we have to draw them to one estate.

84 Of what purpose is it to us to fill our books and writings with injuries
against the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and Moonkes, and to study for
exquisite words and infamous epithetes to breath upon them in the pulpit? Are
we so forgetful that we remember not what we have bin our selves? Let us
bear in mind, that there have not passed many years since we were in the
same pit and quagmier plunged up to the chinne, yea even to the top of our
heads, from whence, if the Lord of his goodness have drawn us, displaying
the tresors of his mercy upon us, follows it therefore that we should
either exclame or cry out against those as unhappily remain yet in the place,
from whence we are come? Were it not better to offer the^ our hand to help to
pull them out of the pit, and to exhort them gently to acknowledge the
miserable estate wherein they are? for it is impossible ever to gain their
hearts by the way we take, because man will be in liberty touching his belief
and religion: and the more he shall be resisted, the more eiger will he be
found in the pursuit of that that is def^ded unto him: employing his body and
goods, with life and all (if need be) to preserve his liberty in these points,
and lastly will esteem those, as his sworn enemies, who by any other means
(than gentleness) will seek to spoil him of this liberty,

85 Too this (brethren) you may answer me, that the tyranny of the papists is
so abominable that there is no heart possessed with any Religion, whose
patience may endure so intolerable a yoke The tyra^nie of the Papists upon
the spirituality and temporaltie.
into the church of God, seeing they are not contented to bury the benefits of
Jesus Christ, to rob and usurp his dignity, to make themselves merchants of
his blud and redemption, to beguile and seduce the poor people and their
consciences sending souls to hell, in place to draw them out of purgatory,
and lastly as a full of their tyra^nie have subdued and put under their feet
the Monarchs, Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Magistrates of the earth, forcing
them to an humility upon their feet: they have usurped Seigniories and
principalities by violence and effusion of man's blood, to the end to make
themselves Princes and great Lords and their children, neuews, and allies,
having attyred themselves gorgiously with stolen feathers like to Esops crow:
and where before they were so simple, that they had scarcely wherewith to fill
their bellies, now some of them are become Princes, some Dukes, Earls,
Marquisses: others triumph at their pleasure, devouring the goods of
strangers: all which is tolerable with them, because that the Pope their
father has put them in possession of such wealth iniustly usurped. And if any
one (kindeled with the grace of our Lord) be privy to such abuses, and goes
about too discover them too the people, incontinent the Popes, their Parents
and Allies, with open mouth do call such Preachers Heretics, Apostates,
bannished Strangers and people unworthy of relief in a Common state, and will
enter forthwith into devise and travail, and that with all diligence to
commit them either to the fire and fagotts, or otherwise to extirpe them quite
from the earth: because they fear that the preachers of truth, discoueryng
their pot of roses (as the proverb says) and that the world understanding
their tirannies, every one will withdraw and take away his fether rightely
belonging to him: and so in the end, the Crow will eftsoons become a crow, and
the simple and poor man return to his first estate.

86 Hereunto I answer and say, (good brethren) that you have great reason,
and I would in GOD the stones had mouths to manifest such abuses. But yet
there is necessary to our side a sober observation of modesty in the words we
use to speak: for my part, I dout not at all, that the diligence of ye Popes,
Cardinals, The cause why the Papists and their allies make war against the
Gospel.
with their parents and Allies, is not rather to maynteyne their usurped
estates, than the glory and zeal of God: for if they had any religion, they
would show it in their life and conversation. But (alas) all the world sees
that the greatest zealors and defendors of the Papists, show almost no fear of
god: and the Popes themselves, deride with open throat our Savior Christ,
according to the example of one that died not long since, who having left
behind him many lordships to his children and nephews, usurped by tyranny,
said (in sort of railing or mad scoffing) that this fable of Jesus Christ,
had greatly profited many houses, who of shifting roysters and disordred
people were become possessoures of large revenues. Mark this blasphemy,
consider what religion this holy S. Peter and vicar of Christ had in his
heart, who notwithstanding used his times and occasions so conuenie^tly, as he
forgot nothing that concerned his profit. But my hope is in God, that he will
distroy that Babylon, and the tyrant Nemroth, that defends her, his parents
and Allies, who to preserve their usurpations, raise war against the children
of GOD, and murder them.

87 Expectyng (dear brethren) this horrible judgment and most assured
punishment that will fall upon them, let us use patience in the wrong they offer
us: If they call us heretics, because we will not follow the faith of their
Popes, but embrace that which Christ has taught us. Let us esteem our selves
happy, if they call us apostates, because we be come forth, or rather the
Lord has wonderfully delivered us from the Idolatries and superstitions of
the Papists. Let us account our selves nevertheless happy: for my part, I
protest before the Lord, that it is to me a title and surname of glory and
dignity, to be called Apostate of the Pope and the Antechryst of Rome. If they
call us banished from our country, let us rather rejoice than discomfort,
knowing that God has not banyshed us from his grace, neither is it Christ
that has thrown us out of his spiritual kingdom: but it is the
inquisitours, who would either have banished or burned us per effigiem, in
performing their rage upon the straw and papers, because they could not
execute it upon the flesh and bones of the members of Jesus Christ, Let us give
thanks to God in that such banishments and persecutions proceed not to us as
being guilty either of theft, murder or treason to our Prince and Magistrate,
nor atteynted of any other offense worthy of punishment, but because we search
the health of our souls in the simple and pure word of God.

88 If they call us strangers, let us The children of God are never out of
their own country.
remember yt the heavenly Father, which has aduowed us for his children, is
lord of heaven and of earth. And into what part so ever we shall go, we be in
the country of our father, we be his propre inheritance, as the Prophet
says in the Psalm. 37. That the rightuous shall dwell in the earth, and be
lawful possessors of the same. Let us comfort our selves in this, that
neither our running out of the country, nor our absence from the land of
our birth, has bin moved by any usurpation of the possessions or goods of
other: but only to give place to persecutions. Such fleeing away is not
shameful, but rather honorable, seeing we are companyons of our head and
redeemer Jesus Christ, who from his childhood was a stranger in the countries
of the Egyptians, showing the persecutions of Herod.

89 If our persecuters do curse us, let us bliss them, if they search or
seek our death, let us pray for their life: And when there shall come question
to discover their abuses, tyrannies and extortions, let us use it with
sobriety, modesty, and gravity, that it may appear eue^ to themselves, that
we are not led by any malice against their persons, but of a spiritual zeal
to the glory of God, the advancement of the kingdom of Christ, chief of the
church, and to the health of the souls of the poor and simple people,
beguyled and seduced even until now, by the preachers of dreams and fables,
who under the color of Jesus Christ, have martired his church: and being in
deed very ravening Wolves, do name themselves pastors and shepeherdes of the
troop of God. Lastely, let us endeuer to live in peace one with an other,
whether they be of ye Romish religion, or reformed church, praying always to
the Lord that he willighten us in our ignoraunces, which we ought to show
to every one with all modesty and gentleness, according too the example of
our master and Redeemer Jesus, who has not disdained to receive gently, and
teach myldely his very John. 3.
enemies persecutyng him daily, and making coniurations to take from him Luke.

his life. Let us remember that being eue^ upon the cross, pinched with the
extreme pangs of death, not mynding his own pains, he had remembrance of his
enemies, with prayer to his heavenly Father to pardon their offenses: let us
imitate the Lord our creator, whose mercy and goodness are so plentiful, that
he makes his sun shine both upon the good and the evil. Let us not use
regard, that this man has such an ignorance, nor that man will receive any
article of our confession. Let us love all, help all, embrace al, and support
the ignorances and infirmities of al. For better were it that we failed in this
point (if it be a fault at all) than to make us judges of the conscience of an
other, and give out sentence of condemnation against those that agree not with
us.

90 For end (dear brethren) I beseech you take in good part this my epistle
or letter, moving no otherwise than of an affectioned heart toward you, whereof
the Lord is my witness, and I assure it in mine own conscience: and let it
not (I pray you) be an occasion to you to write books nor Pamphlets, seeing I
have no meaning too enter into arms or war with the pen, neither does the
time serve for it, but rather of need to us all to apply our selves to better
things: and let us labor to increase our knowledge in that which we want to
be doctors of the gospel: for the acknowledging of our ignorance ought rather
to incense us to a will to learn, than to make our selves inquisitours and
censors of the Faith of others, with employing the time to fill books and
papers, with questions altogether impertinent to edification.

91 I humbly beseech the sovereign majesty of our good God and heavenly
father, that it will please him too furnishe your judgments and
understandings with the knowledge of his holy word, to the end that by the
mean of your preachings, your audience may learn a true faith, an assured
hope in Jesus Christ, and a careful mortification of the old Adam, and that
the same Lord, so renew your hearts and inflame your wills in ye affection of
charity toward your neibors, yt from hence forth, we, being joined with you,
and you with us, may live in peace, and tranquillity of body and spirit in the
assembly of our Lord Jesus sovereign pastor of our souls, who, having
bought us by the inestimable price of his obedience, and blood most precious,
it may also please him too guard us against all dissentions, and make us live
in the unity of himself, until, that being spoiled of this corruption, we
may perfectely rejoice in the conjunction of him and the eternal glory
promised us by his mean, of the which in his own person, ye rather to make us
inheritors thereof, he has already taken possession, sitting on ye right hand of
God with all power in Heaven and earth. To whom be all glory and empire for
ever. Amen.

In the town of Antwerp. ij. of Ianua. 1567. Your affectioned brother in Jesus
Christ, and humble companion in the work of GOD, Anthony de Corro, called
Belle Riue.

To the Church of Antwerpe.
THis only (dear brethren) was intended by this Epistle or Sermon, to imparte
it by conference with the prechers of the church, naming themselves of the
confession of Auspurge, without meaning to communicate it by publication,
albeit because diverse written copies are comen into the hands of sundry and
several persons, I thought it to better purpose to spread abroad and deliver
it in print, than to suffer it to be argued in secret, least the same might
move cause of sinister judgment against the simple and sincere integrity of
my meaning, wherein as the labor was peculiar in my self, without the
enteruiew or counsel of any, so, if it include any matter to edify or
confirm your consciences, it may please you to be thankful to the Lord as
author of al goodness. And for the errors, I beseech you let them be laid
wholly upon me, as upon a man, who living yet in the peregrination to our
heavenly country, where (we shall have perfect knowleage) may err and fail
in many things. For we know that we are 2. Cor. 5.
trauailers and iorneymen in this body, we are absente from the Lord, and
walk by Faith, and not by view. For end, I wipe my hands before God and you
all of any intent either to redarguate or confute the articles presented by
those that call themselves of the Confession of Auspurge, but rather to let
them see upon what small causes they have formed great quarrels, maynteinyng
dissension for a thing of small importance, and forbear too deal in matters
more necessary.

Seeing also (good brethren (that upon the impression there remained certain
leaves void and vnfurnyshed of matter, I thought it not out of purpose to
fill them with certain places of Holy Scripture, persuading the Faythefull to
acts of Charity, with brotherly unity one to an other, yea not to forbear
to love our proper enemies, and such as pursue us with persecution: a virtue
at this day, most importaunt and necessary, the rather for that Satan
employeth a wonderful diligence to sow seeds of dissension and quarrel,
with special endeavor and strange means too corrupt the league of charity
left unto us by Christ of such commendation: and all this under a pretense
of diversity in religion, wherein as we ought to stand upon our guard
against the subtilties and policies of the Devil, so assuredly, God has not
left us either license or liberty once to think, that it is lawful for us
to hate any man, in respect to maynteine our religion, seeing we are expressly
enjoined by the words of the same, to love such as despise us, and pray for
those that persecute our bodies and doings. But alas, we are slipte into a
time so miserable, and infected with such corruption and blindness, that in
the maynteyning of the integrity of our faith, we become preiuditiall to the
league of charity, with a negligent care of the virtue of the same. For my
part I allow justly such diligence as is used in the purgation of abuses and
errors, to the end our holy faith and Religion may the rather be purifyed, and
remain without spot: albeeit I wish a precyse observation of Christian
charity, least in making war against the Heretics of our faith, we become
not heretics against charity. For which cause and to the end that every one
be privy to the bond and obligation which God in this purpose, demaundes at
our hands, I have here coolled out of the divine word certain special
Textes importing our charitable duties and office unto our neighbor,
desiring you (dear brethren) to construe in the best my intent, tending
simply and altogether to refute those Fables, dreams, and errors, which I
see sundry with no small diligence, labor to support and mainteyne in the church
of Christ wishing they participated rather with a spirit of humility and
mildness in the correction of the opynions of others, than to strive to
become inquisitors of other men's faith, and much less to enter into sentence
of judgment against such as refuse their interpretations, until they be
assured by the spirit of God, that such opinions are directly against the
heavenly word, and that we have witness in our conscience, yt God calls us
to do it, for then he himself will cloth us with the affection of his apostle,
who to gain and reduce his brethren would not stick almost to abandon his
propre health: even so when we feel such a zeal move Romans 9.
in us, even then also shall we prove in our selves, that God will bliss our
enterprises. Let us then embrace peace, and enterteine mutual accord, seeing
that as there is nothing that leuieth a more sharp war within us, than our
own discordes, disdaines and partialities, so of the contrary, if we march
under the ensign of charity, supporting one an other in our infirmities, it
shall be most hard either to break our array, or put us to flighte: For as
Solomon Eccl. 4.
says: The accord of three strings is very hard to break.

My little children, I am yet for a little time with you, you shall search me,
but as I said John. 13.
to the Jews, that whether I go, they could not come, I say also ye same unto
you now, giving you this new commandment, that you love one an other (as I
say) I have loved you, to the end also that you love one an other. By this all
men shall know, that you are my disciples, if you love one an other. That is
the principal mark of our christianity, all others that we may invent,
may be followed of the hypocrites, but this is inimitable, because it is
peculiar only to the regenerate, and those that be renewed by the spirit of
God.

Be you desirous of the most exellent Cor. 12. and 13.
gifts, and I will show you a way yet more excellent. If I speak the languages
of men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am as the metal that soundes, or
Cimball that tynkes. And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all
secrets, and every science, and if I had such faith as I might transporte the
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing: if I distribute all my goods
to the relief of the poor, and deliver my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profits me nothing: Charity is not easily incensed to anger,
but she is mylde. Charity is not envious, Charity is not insolente, she
swells not with anger, she does not use her self dishonestly, she searches
not her profit, she is not despytefull, she thinks no evil: She takes no
pleasure in injustice, but rejoices in the truth: she endures all,
believes all, hops for all, and suffers all: Charity never falls. And a
little after he says: These three things remain, Faith, Hope, and Charity:
whereof the greatest is Charity. Those be the effects of Christian Charity,
which is neither vain opinyon nor curtesye in outward show, but rather a
virtue bryngyng forth wonderful fruits.

Touching brotherly Charity, there is 1. Tessa. 4.
no great need I write to you thereof, seeing you are taught of GOD to love one
an other, for even so you do toward all your brethren which be in
Macedonie. Brethren, we exhort you to surmounte more and more with diligence
to live peaceably: If the unction of the Spirit of God have not yet taught you
to love your neighbors, let us fear that our doctrine is not rather learned of
men, than in the school of God.

He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness to
this hour: 1. John. 2. and. 3.
who loves his brother, remains in the light, and falls not: but he that
hates his brother walks in darkness, and knows not whether he goes, for
the darkness has blinded his eyes. By this are manifested the children of
God, and the children of the devil. Who so ever does not justice, and loves
not his brother is not of God: for this is it you have heard preached from the
beginning, that we love one an other, not as Cain, which was called wicked,
and killed his brother: and for what cause did he kill him? for that his woorks
were wicked, and his brothers were just. Brethren marvel not if your brother
hate you: in that we love our brethren, we know we are transferred from death
to life: who loves not his brother dwells in death: who hates his brother
is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining with
in him: by this we know his charity, that he has given his life for us, we
ought also to hazard our lives for our brethren. And this is a most certain
and ample explication of the mark of our christianity which may serve as a
touch stone to assure us of our adoption.

Hate makes quarrels, but charity covers Proverb 10. Verse. 12.
al grudges. This witness does teach us that the root of dissentions and
debates, is the default of christian charity, which does not only cover
outward sins, but also the ignorances of the understanding.

The furious man moves contention, but Ibidem. 15. Verse. 17. and 18.
the pacient man appaiseth quarrel: this is a looking glass wherein we may
behold the troublesome mynds of our time, who upon small causes will stir up
strange quarrels and debates.

Welbeeloued, let us love one an other, 1. John.
for charity is of God, and who loves, is borne of God, and knows God, and
he that loves not, knows not God, for God is charity. In this is
manifested the charity of God toward us, that he has sent his only son intoo
the world, to the end we may live by him. In this is charity, not that we
have loved God, but because he has loved us, and sent his son to be the
appointment for our sins: Well-beloved, if God have so loved us, we ought also
to love one an other. Never any man has seen God. If we love one an other, God
dwells in us, and his charity is accomplished in us: by this we know that we
dwell in him, and he in us, that he has given us of his holy spirit. And a
little after: If any say that he loves God, and hates his brother, he is a
liar: for if he love not his brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom
he sees not? And we have this commandment of him, that he that loves God,
loves also his brother. This text has no need of interpretation, but rather
of proof and examination, wherein let every man sound and prove his heart,
whether these words be with him or against him.

Thou shalt not see the Ox or sheep of Deuteronomy. 22.
thy brother strayed out of the way, and hide thee from them, but thou shall
bring them ageyn to thy brother. And if thy brother be not thy neighbor, and
thou know him not, then shall thou lead them within thy house, and suffer
them to remain with thee until thy brother demand them, and then thou shall
restore them to him: thou shall do in like manner to his Ass, to his
garments, and all the lost things of thy brother, which he has lost and thou
found, neither must thou hyde them: thou shall not see the Ass or Ox of thy
brother fallen in the way, and hide thee from them, but thou shalt help to
lift them up with him. If the Lord command that our charity be showed in the
lifting up of beasts, let us consider with stronger reason, that his majesty
would that we have care of the souls of our brethren and neighbors: whom if
we see strayed from the way of truth, let us labor to reduce them: if they be
fallen into the pit of error, let us offer them our hands rather than to
pronounce sentence of condemnation, and pursue them even unto death.

Texts of the divine word, exhorting us to love our enemies, and pray for
such as persecute us.
Thou shall not walk as a detractour amongst Leui. 19.
the people, thou shalt not dress thy self against the blood of thy
neyghbor, for I am the Lord: Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart,
correct thy neighbor, and suffer no sin upon him: Thou shall not revenge nor
keep malice against the children of thy people: but thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self: for Iam the Lord.

You have heard that it has bin said, thou Math. 5.
shall love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy. But I say unto you: Love your
enemies, bliss those which curse you, do good to such as hate you, and pray
for those that run upon you to persecute you, to the end you be the
children of your father that is in heaven: for he makes his Sun shine upon
the good and evil, and sendes rain upon the just and iniust: For if ye love
those that love you, what reward have you therefore? The Paganes do not they
the like also? And if you embrace only your brethren, what do you more? Do
not the pagans also ye like? Be you perfect as your father is perfect that is
in heaven.

Do not render to any evil for evil: procure Romans 12.
honest things before all men: And if it may be at least as much as is in you,
have peace with all men. Do not revenge (well-beloved) but give place to anger,
for it is written: To me belongs vengeance, says the Lord, and I will give
it: if then thy enemy be hungry, give him too eat, if he have thirst, give
him to drink: for in this doing thou shalt assemble coals of fire upon his
head. Be not overcome with evil, but surmount the evil by the good.

Owe nothing to any man, if not that you Romans 13.
love one an other: for who loves an other has accomplished the law, which
says: Thou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not kill, thou shall bear no
false witness, thou shall not covet etc. And if there be any other
commandment, it is in effect comprehended in this word, Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self. Truly if we had this stone of foundation of brotherly
charity in the buildings of our life, trafficks and contracts with our
neighbors, all the parts of this spiritual house which God has given us
incharge, should be well ordered and couched.

After the Lord had washed their feet, John. 13.
and taken ageine his garment, and that he was set ageine at the table, he
said unto them: Know you what I have done unto you? you call me Lord and
master, and you say well, for so I am: if then I that am Lord and master have
washed your feet: you ought also to wash one an others feet. For I have given
you example, that even as I have done, you may also do. Why have not we
remembrance of this holy ceremony when we celebrate the Supper of Christ,
seeing that he himself has prepared the hearts of his disciples with this
admonition before he showed or did institute the sacrament of their conjunction
with him, giving them to understand that he is not worthy to receive Jesus
Christ, which does not apply his heart too wash the feet of his brethren?

I speak truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness by the
holy Romans 9.
spirit, that I have great sorrow and continual torment in my heart: for I did
desire to be separated with Christ for my brethren, which be my parents
according to the flesh. When we shall feel our hearts so well touched with the
spirit of god, as S. Paul was, let us set upon hardly to correct the errors
and opinions of others, and so long as we are fleshely, and guided rather by
stomach than spiritual zele, let us employ our time to pray to God for the
ignorant.

Let us be then (as chosen vessels of God, Coloss. ^.
holy and well-beloved) clad in the intrails of mercy, humility, ge^tlenesse,
and of a mind of patience, supporting one an other, and pardoning one an other
if we have quarrel: as Jesus Christ has pardoned you, even so forgive you
others: and besides all this, be attired with charity, the very bond of
perfection. And let the peace of God govern in your hearts, whereunto you are
all called in one body, and be gracious. The word of God dwell frutefully in
you in all wisdom, teaching and warning one an other, in Psalms, songs, and
spiritual praises with grace, singyng with your heart to the Lord, whereby we
shall see how far from these rules of charity be they, that in place to
edify the Church of Christ, do rather procure her confusion with their
Debates and questions.

FINIS.
