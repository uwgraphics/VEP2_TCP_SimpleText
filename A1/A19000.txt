Constant, fair, and fine Betty. Being The Young-mans praise, of a curious
Creature. Fair she was, and fair in deed, And constant always did proceed.
To the Tune of, Peggy went over Sea, with a Soldier.




NOw of my sweet Bet^ie,
I must speak in praise,
I never did see
such a Less in my days,
She is kind and loving,
and constant to me;
Wherefore I will speak,
of my pretty Betty.
Betty is comely,
and Betty is kind,
Besides she is pretty,
and pleases my mind:
She is a brave bonny Less,
lovely and free,
The best that ere was,
is my pretty Betty.
Her hair it does glister,
like to threeds of gold;
All those that do meet her,
admire to behold:
Her they take for Juno,
so glorious seems she,
^^^e brighter then Lun
is pretty Betty.
Her eyes they do twinkle,
like stars in the sky,
She is without wrinkle,
her forehead is high:
Fair Venus for beauty,
the like cannot be,
Thus I show my duty,
to pretty Betty.
She has fine cherry cheeks,
and sweet Coral lips,
There is many one seeks,
love with kisses and clips,
But she like Diana,
flies their company,
She is my Tytana,
my pretty Bettie.
Her Chinne it is dimpled,
her visage is fair,
She is finely temp^ed,
she is neat and rare.
If Hellen were living,
she could not please me,
I joy in praise giving,
my pretty Betty.
Her skin white as snow,
her breast soft as down,
All her parts below.
they are all firm and sound:
She Is chaste in affection
as Penelope.
Thus ends the complexion,
of pretty Bettie.
The second part, To the same tune.




NOw of her conditions,
something I Will declare,
For some have suspicions,
She Is false being fair:
But she is not false hearted,
in any degree,
I Am glad I consorted,
with pretty Betty.
Her words and her actions,
they are all as one,
And all her affection,
is on me alone,
She h^tes such as vary,
from true constancy,
Long I must not tarry,
from pretty Betty.
Well met my sweet Honey,
my joy and delight,
O how has my Cony
done ere since last night.
Oh what says my dearest,
what say thou to me,
Of all maids the ra^est,
is pretty Bette.
Woe. Kind love thou art welcome,
to me day and night,
Why came you not home,
I did long for your sight:
My joy and my pleasure,
is only in thee,
Thou art all the treasure,
of pretty Bette.
Had thou not come quickly,
I think I should dye,
For I was grown sickly,
and did not know why.
Now thou art my doctor,
and physic to me,
In love thou art proctor,
for pretty Bette.
Sweet when shall we marry,
and lodge in one bed,
Long I cannot carry,
not my maiden head.
And there is none shall have the same,
but only thee,
It Is thee that I crave,
to love pretty Bette.

Man. Besse be thou contented,
we will quickly be wed,
Our friends are consented,
to all has bin sed,
Thou shall be my wife,
ere much older I be,
And I Will lead my life,
with my pretty Bette.

These lovers were married,
and immediately,
And all was well carried,
they lived lovingly:
Let fair maids prove constant,
like pretty Besse,
Fine Besse has the praise an't,
and worthy is she.
