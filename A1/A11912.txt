THE seventh Tragedy of Seneca, Entitled MEDEA: Translated out of Latin into
English, by JOHN STVDLEY, Student in Trinity College in Cambridge.

Imprinted at London in Fleetestreate, beneth the Conduit, at the Sign of
Saint John Evangelist, by Thomas Colwell. Anno Domini M. D. LXVI.

To the right honorable Frauncis Lord Russell, Earl of Bedford, one of the
Queens Majesty's privy Counsel: Knight of the most honorable order of the
Garter, Lord Gou^rnour of ^arwicke, and Warden of the East matches. John
Studley wissheth health, with ^ncrease of Honor.
AS it was not (right Honorable) the great excess, and abounduance of ANTONIUS
gluttinge fare, but the little precious Perle of CLEOPATRA that wanthe price,
when they contended, whether of the^ might devour more at one meal: Even so
this my little volume wherewith I present your Honor, may argue unto your
Lordship a more manifest proof of my good will toward your Honor, then y^
rich Jewels and so^mes of gold and silver, y^ wordly minds do use to gratify
their friends withal. Therefore I knowing your Honor to be of the like mind
with him y^ was Judge between CLEOPATRA and ANTONIUS, lightly esteem, and
highly contempne al bribyng golden gifts that as much or more glutteth virtuous
minds, then might Antonius excessive fare: I have presumed, to offer unto your
Honor, a small Pearl of y^ pearless^ Poet and most Christian Ethnicke Seneca,
wherein no glutting, but sweet delectacion, is offered unto y^ mind that does
hunger after virtue. But I need not to burnish Gold being so bright of it
self, neither to commend the value of it unto him whose skillful and learned
judgment ca^ beter esteem of it the^ mi imbecilitie is able to express.
Therefore trustyng your Honor (whose ^^ale in favoring and furtheryng all
learning and good Studies is most manifest) will accept my good will signified
by this travel of my simple, rude and unskillful pen, and bear with my bold
attempt, whereunto your Honors great courtesy has highly encouraged me to
aspire, beseching your Lordship to take upon you the tuicion of so weak a
Fortress, whom without your trusty aid, the parlous force of ill ^onges might
soon overthrow: promisyng your Honor hereafter the further fruytes of my
ryper Muse, I cease at this instant to trouble you: whom I leave to ^he tuicion
of our savior Jesus Christ: wishing ^our encr^ase of honor, long life and
luckie success in all affairs and attempets.

Your Honors to command, John Studley.

The Preface to the Reader.
IF I had not gentle Reader a better trust in thy gentleness, then affyance
in mine own weakness, I had not assayed this second attempt, to bewraye my
rudeness and ignorance, unto thy skillful judgment: but though I mystrusted
my self, yet I so reposed my hope in thee, that it gave me courage to translate
this one Tragedy more of SENECA, for the pleasure of the learned, and the
profit of the unlearned by reading of it in their natyue language. What kind
of Tragedy it is, or what is to be learned thereby, I need not stand at large
to dyscusse, being so plainly set furthe by SENECA, far better then I am able
to show or translate it, so worthelye as he has written it: yet as God has
given me grace, rudely and symply I have performed it: And because that all
thing might be to the better understanding and commodytye of the unlearned, as
in some places I do expound at large the dark sense of the Poet: so have I
changed the first Chorus, because in it I saw nothing but an heap of
profane stories, and names of profane Idols: therefore I have altered the
whole matter of it, beginning thus: Who has not wist. Diverse reasons could I
aledge to maintain this mine alteracion, but I trust thy gentleness will way
it to the vttermoste, and take all things in better part. Thus I bid thee
farewell.

W. F. in the Translatours behalf.
GRudge not though younger years do^ toil,
where horye heddes might wade,
Whose sappye wit more apter seems
to travel in this trade.
For who can more Mineruas face
then lustye youth express?
Or where do Muses more delyght
then in this youthfulness?
Dame Nature shows in her works
how younger things excel,
The younger flowers commonly
do give the sweter smell^
The younger bows with grener leaue^
a tayrer face does show:
More gladsome is the pleasant plot,
where grener grass does grow,
We see also the fre^sher grape
does make the sweeter wine,
Why then should do^yng age at youth
for want of age repyne?
L^e Senec crounde with Lawr^ll leaf,
in England now appears,
Medea pende with hawtye style
now Englysh Meetre wears:
O P^squell paynte their pynyng shame,
and Parcae do not spare
With speed to shred their ly^es^ that do
deny to grant the share
And praise unto the paynfull pen,
that has deserved so,
In brynging thus abroad his Mus^
to profyt ^reynde and foe^
The Argument to the Tragedy by the Translatour.
C^re sore did gripe Medeas heart, to see
Her Jason whom she tendered as her life,
And rescued had from plunge of pe^yis fre^
Renoun^^nge her, to take another wife,
Love sp^nt in vain breeds hate and malice rife,
^n^yn^lyng coals, whose heat and gredie flame
(Save streams o^ blood,) naught else can quench the same^
Medea mad in troubled mind does muse,
On veng^aunce fell, to quit her gre^ous wrong.
Roughe plages at length entend^th she to use:
Ill venomous things she charms with charming song
Seeks out a Baane mad^ of their poison strong
In trayt^rous gifts a Rob^, and chain of Gold
Nicely she does the hidden poison fold.
Sent are the Gifts to Creuse and her Sie^,
They takyng^ them that brought their dol^ to pass
Vnwar^ are bu^nt by means of charmed ^ier,
Due vengeance yet for Jason greater was,
Life fir^^ on child by mothers hand (alas)
Expired has, which though it him agryse,
Yet his other ch^lde she slayes before his eyes.
The names of the Speakers of this Tragedy.
Medea. Cho^us. Nutrix. Creon. Jason. Nuntius.
The first Act.
Medea. O Gods whose grace does guide their gob^les
that joy in wedlock pure,
O Juno thou Lucina hight,
on whom the chary cure
Allotted is of those, that groan
in paynfull chyldbed ^andes,
O Pallas by whose heavenly art
Sir Typhis conning hands
Have learnde to bridle with his helm
his newly framed boat,
Wherewith the force of fighting fluddes
he brekynge rydes a flote.
O God whose forked Mace does storms
in rygour rough appeas,
And cause the rufflyng surges couche
amid the rampinge Seas:
O Titan who upon the swifte
and wherlinge Hemisphaer
D^uides the cheerful day and night
by egall turns tappere.
O threfolde shapen Hec^te
that sendest furthe thy light,
Unto thy sylent Sacryfyse
that offered is by night,
By whom my Jason swear to me
o heavenly powers all,
And ye on whom Medea ^aye
with safer conscience call,
O Dungeon dark^, most dreadful den
of everlasting night,
O dampened gohstes: o kingdom set
against the gods aryghte:
O Lord of sad and lowrynge lakes,
o Lady dire of Hell,
(Whom though that Pluto stale biforce
yet did his ^roth excel
The ficle faith of Iasons love,
that he to me does bear,)
With cursed throat I conjure you,
o grys^ye gohstes appear.
Come out, come out, ye hellish hagges,
revenge this deed so dire,
Bring in your scratting paws a burning
brande of deadly fire.
Rise up ye hiddiuos devilish feendes,
as dreadful as ye wear,
When unto me in wedlock state
ye did sometime appear.
Work ye, work ye, the dole full death
of this new wedded wife.
And martyr ye this father in law:
depryue of breath and life
King Creons ruthful famylie:
in plunge of passing pain
Torment ye me, that on my spouse
do wyshe this woe to reyne:
Preserve my Iasons life, but yet
let him be bayted out
A mychyng, rogyng, runagate,
in foreign towns about.
To pass from door to door, with care
to beg his nedy bread.
Not knowing in what harbryng place
to couche his curssed head:
A banysht wretch, dysdaynd of all,
and still in fear of life,
Then let him wish ten thousand times
for me again his wife:
This famous gest whom every man
will entertayne and have,
Let him be dryue^ at strangers gates
the table cru^mes to crave.
And that my bitter bannynges may
with myschefe most abound,
God grant in gulphe of like dystresse
his children may be drounde,
To synke in sorrows storms, that do
there mother ouerflowe:
Now, now, I have, I have the full
revenge of all my woe.
I have dispatched: my pyteous playnte
and words in vain I lose:
What shall not I with vyolence
get up against my foes?
And wring out of their wrested hands
the weddyng torche so bright?
Shall I not force the firmament
to lose his shrynkyng light?
What does my grandsirs Phoebus face
this heuie hap behold?
And standing gasyng at this gear
yet westwarde is he rolde,
On glystrynge chariot hoysted high,
and kepes his beaten race,
Amid the crystal colourde sky,
why turns he not his face,
Retyringe fast into the East
back up the day to twyne?
O father Phaebe to me, to me,
thy Charyot reygnes resygne,
That I advanced up, about
the marble skies may ride,
Bequeath thy bridle unto me,
and give me grace to guide
Thy yoked prauncyng team, with yerkyng
lasshe of burning whyp,
That with thy fervent fyry beams
on purple poale do skyp.
Let Corinthe country burnte to duste
by force of flame and fire
Give place, that both the ^umbled seas
may join: whom to retire
It does compel, and dassheth of
from bank on either side,
Least mete in one their channels might,
whose streams he does deuyde.
No way to work their deadly woe
I have but this at hand,
That to the weddyng I should bear
a ruthful brydall brande,
Anoyenge Creons careless Court:
when fynyshed I have
Such solemn s^ruyce, as that ryght^
of sacrafyce do the crave,
Then at the Alters of the Gods
my chyldr^n shall be slain,
With crimsen colored bl^od of babes heart,
their alters will I stain.
Through livers, lounges the lights and
through every gut and gall,
For vengeance break away perforce,
and spare no blood at all:
If any lustye life as yet
within thy soul do rest,
I fought of ancient courage still
do dwell within my breast,
Exile all folysh female fear,
and py^ye from thy mind,
And as thuntamed Tigers use
to rage and rave unkind,
that haunt the crokyng combrus caves
and clumpred frosen cliues,
And craggy rocks of Caucasus,
whose bitter cold depryues
The soil of all inhabytours,
permyt to lodge and rest,
Such sa^uage brutysh tyranny
within thy brazen breast.
What ever hurly burlye wrought
does Phasis understand,
What myghtie moustrous blody feate
I wrought by sea or land:
The like in Corinth shall be seen
in most outragyous guyse,
Most hiddious^ hateful, horrible,
to hear, or see with eyes.
Most d^uelysh, desperate dredful deed,
yet never known before,
Whose rage shall force heaven, earth and hell
to quake and tremble sore.
my burning breast that rowles in wrath
and does in rancour boil,
Sore thrysteth after blood, and wounds
with slaughter, death and spoil,
By rentyng racked lyms from lyms
to drive them down to grave:
^ush, these be but as Fleabytynges,
that mentioned I have:
As weyghtie things as these I did
in greener girlysh age,
Now sorrows smarte does rub the gall
and frets with sharper rage.
But since my womb has yellded fruit,
it does me well behoue,
The strength and parlous pu^ssaunce
of weyghtier illes to ^roue.
Be redye wrath, with all thy might
that furye kyndle may,
Thy foes to their dystruction
be ready to assaye:
Of thy deuorsement let the Price
to match, and counterpayse
The proud and precious pryncely pomp
of these new weddyng days.
How will thou from thy spouse depart?
as him thou followed have
In blood to ^athe thy blody hands
and traytrous lives to wast.
Break of in time these long delays,
abanden now again,
This lewd alliance, got by gylte,
with greater gylt refrain,

Chorus altered by the Translatour.
WHo has not wist that windy words be ^ain^,
And that in talk of trust is not the g^ounde,
Here in a mirror may he see it plain,
Medea so by ^ro^fe the same has found.
Who being blind by blinded Venus boy,
Her bleared eyes could not behold her bliss:
Nor spy the present poysen of her ioy^,
While in the gr^sse the Serpent lurked is.
The shafte that flew from Cupids golden bow,
With feathers so has dy^d her daseld eyes,
That can not see to shun the way of woe:
The rancklyng head in dent^d ha^te that lies,
So dulles the same, that can not understand
The cause that brought false Jason out of Greec^^
To come unto her fathers fertile land,
Is not her love, but love of golden Fleece.
Yet was his speech so pleasant and so mild,
His tongue so fylde, his promyses so fair,
Sweet was the fowlers song that has beguylde
The selye bird, brought to the lymed snare.
Faith, in his face, trust shy^ed in his eyes,
The blusshyng brow plain m^nynge seemed to show,
In double ha^te black treason hydden lies,
Dissembling thoughts that weaue the web of woe.
The honyed lyppes, the tongue in sugar depte
Do^ sweet the poison rank within the breast,
In subtle show of painted sheath is kept,
The rustye knyfe of treason demed least,
Life seems the bayte to sight that lies brym,
Death is the hook that vnderlyes the same,
The candell blase delyghtes with burning trym,
The Fly, till ^^e be burned in the flame,
Who in such shows least dem^d any illes.
The hungrye fysshe fears not the bayte to Brook,
Till up the line do pluck him by the gylles,
And fast in throat he feles the deadly hook.
Woe Jason, woe to thee most wretched man,
Or rather wretch Medea woe to thee,
Woe to the one that thus dyssem^le can,
Woe to the other that trained so might be.
Thoughst thou Medea his eyes to be the glass
Whe^in thou might the face of thoughts behold,
That in his breast with words so covered was,
As cancred brass with gloss of yelow gold?
Did thou suppose that nature (more then kind)
Had placed his heart his ly^nge lyppes between,
His looks to be the mirror of his mind?
Faith in fair face has ^^ldome yet ben seen.
Who lyst^eth to the flateryng Maremaides note,
Must needs commyt his tired eyes to sleep,
Ye^lding to her the ^aking of his boat,
That means unware to drown him in the deep.
What boteth the^ Medea to betraye
The golden Fleece, to fawnyng Iasons hand,
From Dragons teethe him safely to conuaye,
And fyrye Bulls the warders of the land?
Why for his sake from father have thou fled,
And thrust thy self out from thy natyue soil?
Thy brothers blood what ay^^d thee to shed,
With Jason thus to travel and to ^oyle?
Behold the meede of this thy good de^a^te,
The recompense that he to thee does gy^e.
For pleasure, pain, for joy, most eger smarte,
With cloggyng ca^es in banyshment to ly^e.
Tho^, and thy babes, are like to ^egge and ^^ar^e,
In Nation stra^nge, (o miserable life)
While Jason from his promyses do ^wa^u^,
And takes delyght in his new wedded wife.
O ground ungrate, that when the husband man
Has tylled it, to recompense his toil
No corn, but weeds, and ^h^stles cendder can,
To ^^ynge dys hands, that truyte sekes of his soil.
Such venom grows of pleasaut colored flower:
Lo^, princes lo, what deadly poison sup
Of ba^e, erst sweet, now turned into sowe^,
Mede^ dranc^^ out of a goulden c^p.
The second Act.
Medea. Nutrix. AYe me alas I am undone,
for at the brydall cheer
The warble note of weddinge song
resou^ded in mine ear.
Yet for all this scant I my self,
yet scant believe I can,
That Jason would play such a prancke,
amoste unthankful man,
Both of my country, and my sire,
and kingdom me to spoil,
And yet forsake me wretch forlorn,
to straye in forreyn soil.
O has he such such a stonye heart,
that does no more esteem,
The great good turns, and benefits
that I imployde on him?
Who knows, that I have lewdly used
enchauntmentes for his sake,
The rigor roughe, and stormy rage,
of swellyng seas to slake.
The gruntyng fyryefomyng Bulls
whose smokyng guts were stufte
With smoltering fumes, y^ from their jaws,
and nostrels out they puffed
I stopped their gnasshing mou^ching mouths
I que^cht their burning breath,
And vapors hott of stewyng paunche,
that else had wrought his death.
Or fedes he thus his fansye fond,
to think my skyll of charm
Abated is, and that I have
no power to do him harm?
Bestract of wits, with wavering mind
perplexed on every part,
I tossed, and turmoyled am,
with way ward crasy heart.
Now this, now that, and neither now,
but now another way,
By diverse means I toil, that so
my wrong revenge I may.
I would the wreatche a brother had:
but what? he has a wife.
Go cut her throat, with ghastly wou^des
bereue her of her life.
On her i will work my deadly spyte,
her, her alone I crave,
To quit such bitter sowsyng storms,
as I sustained have.
If any graund notoryus gylt
in all Pelasga land
Be put in practyse yet unknown
unto thy harmyng hand,
Thereof to get experience
the time does now begin:
Thy former feats do bid thee tak^
good hope^ to thryue herein:
Let al thy gyltes with thronging thic^
assemble thee to aid,
The golden Fleece (the chief nouel)
of Colchis I Will betrayde.
My tender brother eke, that with
my sier did me pursue,
Whom with his secret parts cut of
I wicked virgin slew,
Whose shreaded and dismembered corpse,
with swerd in gobbits hewd,
(A woeful coarse toth fathers heart)
on Pontus ground I strewed.
How horye he added P^lias
his wythred age to shyfte
To grener years, for longer life,
his daughters by my dryfte
His members all and mangled flesh
with lycour scaldyng hot
Ysodden, and perboyled have,
in seething brazen pot.
How often in heinous blood have these
my cruel hands ben dyed?
And never any gylte as yet
by wrath inflamde I tried.
But now the parlous poysnyng wou^d
of Cupids percing darte
Does boil and rage within my breast,
it rancles at my heart.
But how could Ias^n it redress,
whom fortunes froward will
Has ye^ld unto another hand,
at lust to save or spyll?
O rage of rusty cancred mind
this sclaundrous talk amend,
If fortunes grace will grant it thus,
let him unto his end
Live still my Jason as he was,
but if not Jason mine,
Yet caytife suffer Jason live,
though Jason none of thine:
Who being myndfull still of us
some favor let him show,
For these good turns yt our good will
could erst on him bestow:
King Creon is in all the fault,
and only worthy blame,
Who puffed up with scepter proud,
unable for to frame
His tyckle mind to modestye,
made breach tw^xt us again,
Whom Hymen's bands, and link of love
had made but one of twain,
By whom eke from her ^ender brats
the mother (wreatche) is drawn,
He breaks the vow, that gaged is
with such a precious pawn.
Seek after such a vyllaynes blood,
in daun^ynge panges of smarte
Let him alone be surely dowst,
such is his due desarte,
A dungell heapt of Cinders burnt
his Pallayce make I shall,
that Malea where in winding strightes,
the lyngryng ships do crall,
Shall gase on smolthryng turrets tops
turmoylde in cracklyng flame.
Nu. For godsake madame I you pray
your tongue to silence frame.
Eke hyde your pryuye languyshyng
and grief in secret vain:
Who with a modest mind abydes
the spurs of pryckyng pain,
And suffers sorrows patiently,
may it repaye again.
Who bears a pryuie grudge in breast,
and kepes his malice close,
When least suspection is thereof
may most anoye his foes.
He leseth oportunytie
who vengeance does require,
That shows by open sparks the flame
the heat of kyndled fire.

Me. Small is the grype of grief that can
to reasons lore obaye,
And snekyng down with steling steps
can stylie slyppe away.
But they that thoroughly sowsed are
with showers of greater pain,
Can not digest such corsyes sharp,
but cast it up again:
Feign would I give them trouncyng girds.

Nu. Good daughter dear assuage
Thunbrydled swaye, and boiling heat
of this thy gyddie rage:
Scant may thou purchase quietness
although thou hold thy tongue.

Me. The valiant heart dame Fortune yet
durst never harm with wrong
But dreadyng dastards down she drives.

Nu. If any courage dure,
And harbred be in noble breast,
now put the same in ure.

Me. The show of sturdye valiant heart
at any time does shine.

Ne. No hope does in aduersytye
the way to escape assygne.

Me. He that ha^h none affiance lefts,
nor any hope at all,
Yet let him not mystrust the luck
of ought that may befall.

Nu. Thy Country clean has cast thee of
to let thee synke or swym,
As for thy husband Jason he,
there is no trust in him:
Of all the wealth, and worldly muck
wherwyth thou did abound:
No portion remaynes at all,
whereby some help is found.

Me. Medea yet is left, (to much.)
and here thou may espy
The Seas to succor us in flight,
and lands aloof that lie:
Yea iron tools, with burning brands
we have to work them woe,
And Gods that with the thunder dynt
shall ouerquell our foe:

Nu. who wears y^ golde^crested crown
him dread with awe ye should.

Me. My father was a king, yet I
betrayed his Fleece of gould:

Nu. Can not the deadly vyolence
of weapons make the fear?

Me. No though such grislye laddes they were
as whilom did appear,
That bred of gargell dragons teethe
in holow gapyng ground,
When mutually in blody fight
each other did confound.

Nu. Then wylt thou cast thy self to death,

Me. Would God that I were dead.

Nu. Fly, fly to save thy life.

Me. w^ worth the time that once I fled.

Nu. What o Medea.

Me. Why shall I fly?

Nu. A mother dear art thou,
Fly therefore for thy chyldrens sake.

Me. Ye see by wh^m, and how,
A wretched mother I am made.

Nu. Thy life by flight to save
do thou mistruste?

Me. Nay, fly I will,
but vengeance first i will have.

Nu. Then some shall thee at heels pursue,
to wrecke the same again

Me. Perhap i will make his coming short.

Nu. Be still, and now refrain.
O despret dame thy thondring threats,
and slake your raging ire.
Apply, and frame thy froward will
as time and tides require.

Me. Full well may fortu^es weltyng whele
to beggynge bring my state,
As for my worthy courage that
she never shall abate.
Who bowncing at ye gates, does cause
the creakinge doors to iar?
It is the wreatche Creon his self,
whom princely power far
Has lift aloft, with lordlye look,
paft up with powncinge pride,
That he may Corinth contry with
the swaye of scepter guide.

Creon. Medea. MEdea that ungracious imp
king Aetas wicked child
Yet has not from our carfull realm
her lingrynge foot exild.
Some noughtie dryft she goes about,
her knackes of old we know,
Her iugling arts, her harming hands
ar known well long ago.
From who^ will she with hold her harm?
whom will this cruel beast
Permit to live from perrill fre
in quietness and rest?
Clean to cut of this parlous plauge
it was our purpose bent,
But Jason by ^ntreting hard
did cause us to relent.
At his request we granted have
her life she shall enjoy,
Let her acquit our contrye fre
from fear of all annoye:
Yea safely let her pack her hence,
in eger gyddye fit
With lompish lowering look she coms
in talk with me to knitt:
Sirs keep her of, and set her hence,
lest us she touch per hap,
And drive her back from coming nigh
command her keep her clapp.
And let her learn at length, how that
her self submit she may,
The puissaunt payse and majesty
of princes to obaye.
Run, hie the quickelye, trudge apace,
have hence out of my sight
This horible, most odious queen,
this monstrous wicked wight.
Me. My soueraygne liege, what greater crime
have I or less offense
Commit against thye majesty,
to be exiled hence?

Cre. Alas the gyltles woman does
demand a reason why:

Me. If thou be judge indifferent,
ordaynd my cause to try,
Consider then my doubtful case,
and wey the ground of it:
If thou b^ king, command a Judge
for ^uch a matter fyt.

Cre. The princes power thou shall obey,
bit either right or wrong.

Me. The prosperus pride of wrongynge crowns
cannot endeuer long.

Cre. Auaunt, and yell out thy complayntes
at Colchis, get thee hence.

Me. Full gladly will I get me home,
if he that brought me thence
Uouchsafe to b^are me back again.

Cre. Alas to la^e arise
Entreatyng words, when as decree
is taken otherwise.

Me. He that not heryng either part
pronounces his decree,
Unryghteous man accounted is,
though right his sentence be.

Cre. While Pelias trusted to thy talk,
from life to death be fell.
Go to, begin, we give you leave
your goodly tale to tell.

Me. That type of regal maiesty^
that erst by Fortunes hand^
Advanced to I did attain,
has taught me understand,
How hard a thing it is of wrath
the rygour to assuage,
When burning heat o^ boylyng breast
in flames begyns to rage.
Eke for thaduau^cement of their power
more to dysplay in sight
Their kyngly courage bolstred out
with mai^stie of might.
They d^me it does importe aswaye,
and has a ^reater grace,
Whom stately scepter causd to climb
alofte to prouder place.
To persevere with fansye fond,
in that to reasons spyght,
Whose gredy choice attaynted first
his mind with vain del^ght.
For though in pytyous plyght I lie,
thrown down to great decay,
With heau^ hap, and ruthful chance,
to miserable stay,
Thus hunted out from place to place,
forsook and left alone,
A wyddow while my husband live,
with cause to wa^le and moan,
Perplexed in maze of myserye,
with cloyenge cares so r^se,
Yet whysom I in golden trone
have led in happy life.
By high and noble parentage
my bright renoune does shine.
From Phoebus eak my graundsire great
deryued is my ligne.
Whear silver streamed Phasis flood
his wasshyng waves does shed,
Or with contrary crokyng ways
his bathyng channel spread.
what ever wandering coast stretched out
is left aloof behind,
From whence the roaming Scithyan sea
his channel furthe does find,
Where as Meotis fenny plasshe
with pure fresh water sprynges
Does season sweet the bryny sea,
that tide in thither brynges.
Eke all the coasts enuyroned
and kept within the banks
Of Thermodon, where warlyke troops,
and armed wyddowes ranckes,
with painted bucklers on their arms
hold all the land in fear,
with rigor rough of threatening swerd
with force of dentyng spear.
So far to al these wandryng coasts
and cuntreyes round about,
My fathers ample regiment
at large is stretched out.
I being thus of noble race
and in an happy plyght,
With glorious gloss of princely pomp
in honor shynyng bright,
Then pearlesse pears my spousal bed
did sek^ and sewe to have,
But those to be their loving feres
now other Ladies crave,
Rash, ticle, peuysh, indiscreet,
and waueryug fortunes wheel,
Has cast me out the crusshyng cares
of banyshment to feel.
In scepter proud and hautye crown
f^r thine affyance ^aste.
Sith vpsydowne with welkyn wheel
whole mountes of wealth is cast.
This princes do possess, that should
their royaltye dysplay,
Whose fame shall never ra^ed be
with storm of lowryng day,
To succor those whom myserye
in pyt of pains do the ^ouse,
To sheylde and harber supplyantes
in roof of loyal house.
This only brought I from my realm
the precious golden Fleece,
That jewel chief, and eke the flower
of Chyualry in Greece,
The sturdy prop, the rampir strong
the bulwark of your wealth,
And Hercul^s the boystrus Imp
of ^oue I kept in health.
It was by means of my good will
that Orpheus did escape,
Whose harmony the lyu^le^se rocks
with such delyght did rape,
That forced even the clottred lumpes
with hoblyng pryckt to praunce,
And eke the ioconde nodding wooddes
with fotyng fine to dance.
And that those heavenly twyns Castor
and Pollux did not dye,
My dew desarte is doubled twyse,
sith them preserved I.
Of Boreas blustryng out with puffed
cheeks his blastyng breath
His wynged sons I kept alive
both Calais and Zeth.
And Linceus that with pearcing beams
and sharper sight of eye
Could Nauyes on the farther banckes
of Sicill shore espy.
And all the Minians that did come
the golden Fleece to wyn^
As for the Prince of Princes all
I will not bring him in.
With silence Jason will I pa^se,
for whom though him I save,
Yet is not Greece in d^bt to me,
no recompense I crave
To no man him I do impute,
the rest I brough ^ again
For your avail, that you thereby
some profyt might attain.
But only on my Jason dear,
him for my own loves sake
I kept in store, that he of me
his wedded wife should make.
None other fault (God wot) ye have
to charge me with but this,
That Argo Ship by means of me
returned safelye is.
If I a shame fast maid had not
with Cupids bayte ben caught^
If more my fathers health to have
then Iasons I had sought,
Pelasga land had been undone,
and fallen to great decay,
The lustye valyant Capytaynes
had clean been cast away:
And iolye Jason first of all
this now thy son in law,
The Bulls had rent his swalowed lims
in fyery chompyng iawe.
Let Fortune fight against my case
as list her eluysh will,
Yet never shall it grieve my heart,
repent my deed I nyll,
That I should for so many kings
their relynge honor save,
The guerden due that I for this
my crime commit must have,
It lies Creon in thy hand,
if thus it lyketh thee,
Condemn my gyltye gohste to death,
but render first to me,
My fault that forced me offend,
then Creon grant I this,
Receauyng Ias^n (cause of crime)
I gyltye did amysse.
Thou know that I was such an one
when courynge low I lay,
Before thy fete in humble wise
and did intreatynge pray,
Thy gracyous goodness me to grant
some succor at thy hand.
For me a wreache and wreached babes
I ask within this land
Some cotage base, in outcast hole,
some couchyng corner vile,
If from the town thou drive us out
to wander in exile,
Then some bye place aloof within
this realm let us obtain.

Cre. How I am none that tyrant like
with churlysh septer raygne,
Nor proudly or dysdaynfullye,
with hawtie courage hye,
with vau^ting foot do stamp the^ down
that vndertroden lie,
And daunted are in careful bale,
this plainly does dysclose,
In that to me of late I such
a son in law have chose,
Who was a wandryng pylgrim poor,
with sore afflyctyons freight,
Dysmayde with terror of his foe,
that lay for him in wayght.
Because Acastus having got
the crown of Thessail land,
Requires in thy gylty blood
to bathe his wreackfull hand.
He does bewail that good old man
his fyble father slain,
Whom wayght of years with bowing back
to stoop allow constraine^
The godly minded systers, all
yblynde with mystye vale
And clokyng color o^ thy craft
durst ventrusly a^sayle.
That mount of myfcheife merueylus,
to mangle^ ^eaw, and cut,
Their fathers dear unjointed lym^
In boylyng cald^on put.
But for thy open gyl^ynes
if thou can purge the same,
Straight ^ason can dyscharge him self
from blot of gyltye blame.
His gentle hands were never staind^
with gore of any blood.
Aloof from your con^pyracie
refraynyng far he stood.
His harmless hands put not in ^r^
with gorye tools to mell.
But thou that se^st on fire first
th^se mighty myscheifs fell,
Who^ shameless woman's wil^e brain^
and manly stomach stout
Do ^et a gog, for to a tempt
to bring all ils about.
And no regard at all thou have,
how scundyng trumpe of fame
With ryngyng blast of good or ill
do blow abroad thy name:
Get out and cleanse my ^yled realme^
away together b^are
Thine herbs vnmylde of sorcery,
my Lyeges ryd fro fear.
Transporte thee to some other land,
whereas thou may at ease
With odious noys^ of diu^lish charm,
the troubled Gods disease.

Me. If needs thou wylt have me avoid,
my ship to me restore,
Or else my mate with whom I first
aryued on this shore:
Why do thou bid that by my self
I only should be gone?
I came not hither at first without
my company alone.
If this do thee aggryese, that brunt
of wars thou shall sustain,
Comaunde us bot^ the cause thereof
to shu^ thy realm again:
Sith both are gyltye of one act,
w^y do thou partte us twain?
For Iasons sake, not for mine own,
poor P^lias was slain.
Annex unto my traytrous flight
the conquered bootye brave,
My horye headded natural si^r,
whow I forsaken have,
With brothers blody flesh that mangled
was with caruynge knyfe,
Or ought of Iasons forged lies
he gabbes unto his wife.
These dreary deeds are none of mine,
so often as I offend,
Not for mine own co^modytie,
to come thereby in the end.

Cre. time is expierd, by which thou ought
to have been gone away,
With keeping such a cha^ why do
thou make so long delay?

Me. Yet of thy bountye ere I go.
this one boon will I crave.
Although the mother banyshed
so sore offended have,
Let not the vengeance of my fault
through wrathful deadly hate,
Mine innocent and gyltlesse babes
torment in wreached state.

Cre. Away: with loving fryndely grype
thy children I embrace,
And as a father natural
take pytie on their case.

Me. Even for the prosperus good encrece
of fertile spousall bed,
Of Glauce bright thy daughter dear,
whom Jason late has wed.
And by the hope of fruytfull seed,
whose flower in time shall bloome.
By thonour of thy glystryng crowne^
ythralde to fo^tu^es doom,
Which she so full of chop and change
with tycle turnyng wheel
Whirls up and down, in staggring state
makes to and fro to reele.
I thee beseech, (sith to exyle
I am departing now)
O Creon but a little pawse
for mercy me allow,
While of my mournyng brats with kiss
my last farewell I take.
While gasp of faylyng breath perhap
my shyueryng lyms forsake.

Cre. With craft entendyng some deceit
thou crauest this delay.

Me. What falshed for so little time
be cause of terror may?

Cre. No jot of time is short enough
dysplesure to prevent.

Me. Can not one jot to weeping eyes
and tryllyng tears be lent?

Cre. Although against thy ernest suit
unlucky dread do strive,
One day to settle thee away
content I am to give.

Me. This is to much, and of the same
sumwhat abrydge ye may.

Cre. Make speed apace if from our land
thou get thee not away,
Ere Phoebus horse with golden glede
their streamyng beams do shed,
Of dawnyng lamp, thou art condemd
to lose thy wretched head.
The holy day and brydall both
do call me hence away:
And wyls me at the sacred aare
of Hym^neus to pray.

Chorus.
LAui^n of life and dreadlesse was the wight,
Attemp^yng first in slender tot^ryng Barge
With slyuyng Ore the slyced wave to smite,
And durst commyt the dayntie tender charge
Of hazered life to inconstant course of wind,
That turns with change of chances evermore,
To view the land for^oke aloof behynd^,
And shouyng furthe the s^yp from s^fer shore,
And glauncyng through the fomy channel deep
On sund^r c^t wych slender stem the wave,
Twy^^ hope o^ life, and dread of death to sweep,
In narrow gut him self to ^pyll or save:
Expery^nc^ yet of Planets no man had,
They n^ded not the wandryng cours^ to know
Of Sta^^^s, (wherwyth ^he painted sky is clad,)
Not ^l^^a^s, (which return of saylyng ^^^w)
Nor Hyads ^that with showrs the Seas do b^a^e)
No nor the st^rne Amaltheas h^rned ^ead
(Who gave the ^yppes of luckyng Jove the t^ate)
Were wont to put the blunde^yug shyps in dread.
They feared not the northern ysye wayne,
which lazy old boot^s w^^lds behind,
And twynes about, no name yet could they feign
For Boreas rough, nor smother western wind.
Yet Typhys bold on open seas durst sh^we
His hoysted sayl^s, and for the wynds decree
New laws: as now full gale aloof to blow,
Now tackle turnde to take side wind alee,
Now up to fa^le the crossayle on the mast,
Theare safe to hang, the topsayle now to spread,
Now missel sayl^, and drabler out to cast,
When daglyng hanges his sha^tryng tackle red
while st^a^sman stur, and busy^ ne^^r blyn,
With pyth to pull all sails eke to dysplay,
with tooth and nail all forc^ of wind to win,
To sheare the seas, and quyck to scud away.
The golden world our fathers have possessed,
where ^anysht fra^de durst n^u^r come in place,
All were content to live at home in r^st,
with horye head, gray^ ^eard, and surrowed face.
which tract of time within his con^rey brought,
Rich having little, f^r more they did not toy^^,
No vente for wares, nor Traficque far they sought,
No wealth that sprange beyond th^yr naty^e soil,
The Thessail ship together now has set,
The world that w^ll with seas dysseuered lay,
It bydd^s the floods with oats to be bet,
And stream^s unknown with shypwrack us to fray
That wyck^d R^le was lost ^y ruthful wrack
Ytossed through such perils passing great,
where Cyanes rocks began rore as thunde^ crack,
whos^ bouncyng boult the shaken soil does bea^,
The sowsyng surges dasshed eue^y star,
The pe^t^rd seas the clouds alo^te be^ayd,
This scufflyng did boule Typhis mind detar,
His h^lme did slyp from tr^mblynge hand dismayed.
Then Orpheus with his drowp^ng Ha^p was mum
Dead in her dumpes the ^launtyng Argos glee,
All hus^t in rest with silence, w^xed dum,
what hardye heart astound here would no^ bee^
To see at once each yawnyng mouth to gape,
Of Syllas gulf compact in wa^loyng paunche,
Of dogs, who does not loth^ her mong^ell shape,
H^e visage, br^st, and hyddyous ugly ^aunche^
whom erketh not the scoulde with barkyng still?
To her^ the Mermaydes di^e who does not quayle,
That lure the ears with pleasant syngyng ^^ryll
Of such as on ^nsonius sea do sail?
when Orpheus on his twancklyng Harp did play,
That carst the Muse Calliop gave to him
Almost those Nymphs that wonted was to stay
The shypp^s, he causd fast following him to swym.
How ^earely was that wyck^d journey bought?
Medea accursed, and eke the golden Flecce,
That greater harm the^ storm of s^as has wrought
Rewarded well that vo^age ^^rst of Gre^ce.
Now seas controulde do suffer passage free,
The ^rgo proud erected by the hand
Of Pallas first, does not com^layne that she,
Conue^d has back^ the kings unto their land,
Each whirty ^o^t now scuddes about the deep,
All stynts and waares are taken clean away,
The Cytyes frame new walls them selves to keep,
The open world lettes naught res^ where it lay:
The ^oyes of Ind Arexes luckwarme leake,
The Pers^ans stout in Rhene and Albis stream
Do bathe ^heyr barks, ^yme ^^all in fine out break
when Ocean wave shall open every realm.
The wandrynge world at w^ll shall open lie.
And Typhis will some new found land suruaye.
Some trauelers shall the Co^tre^es far escry^,
Beyond small Thule, known furthest at this day^.
The third Act.
Nutrix. Medea. WHy tro^st thou fysking in and out
so rash from place to place?
Stand still, and of ^hyne eger wrath
suppress the ruth^ull race,
The rigor rough of rampyng rage
from burning breast out cast,
As Bacchus bedlem preystes that of
his spryte have felt the blast,
Run frantyck hoytyng up and down
with scytysh wayward wits,
Not knowing any place of rest,
so prycte with froward fyttes,
On cloudye top of Pindus mount
all hyd with snow so chyll:
Or else upon the loftye ridge
of braunched Nisa hill:
Thus startyng still with frou^ced mind
she walters to and froe,
the signs pronou^cyng proof of pangs
her frenzy face does show.
with glowing cheeks, and blood red face
with short and gaspyng breath,
She fetches deep ascendyng syghes
from sobbing heart beneath.
Now blithe she smiles, each ^o^bled thought
in pondring brain she beats,
Now stands she in a mammeryng^
now myscheyfe sore she threats.
w^ chaufing fume she burns in wrath,
and now she does complain,
With blubbering tears a fresh biliue
she weeps and wayles again.
Where will this lumpish load of cares
with hedlong swaye allighte?
On whom entendethe she to work
the threats of her dispite?
Where will this huge te^pestious surge
slake down it self again?
Enkindled furye new in breast
begins to boil a main.
She secretly entendes no misschife
small nor mean of syse
To pass her self in wickedness
her busye brains devise.
The token old of pinchyng ire
full well er this know I:
Sum heinous houge, outrageous great
and dreadful storm is nie:
Her fiery, scowling, steaming eyes,
her hanging groyne I se,
Her powting, puffed, frownyng face,
that signs of freating be.
O myghtie Ione begyle my fear:
Me. O wretch if thou desire,
What measure ought to paise thy wrath
then learn by Cupides fire,
To hate as sore as thou did love,
shall I not them anoye
That do unite in spousall bed,
their want on lust enjoy?
Shall Phoebus fiery footed horse
go lodge in western wave
The drdwping day, that la^^ I did
with humble crowchinge crave,
And with such ernest busy suit
so hardly granted was,
Shall it depart er I can bring
my deuylishe dryfte to pass?
While houeryng heaven does counter paised
hang with egall space,
Amid the marble hemispheares,
while round with stinted race,
The gorgeous sky above the earth
does spinning roll about,
Whiles that the number of the sands,
lies hid vnserched out.
While dawninge day does keep his course
with Phoebus blase so bright,
While twinkling stars in golden trains
do guard the s^ombrie night,
While I sie under propping poale
with whyrlyng swyng so swyft
The shyning bears vnbathed about
The frosen sky do lift,
While flushing ^loodes y^ frothy streams
to rustling seas do send,
To gird them gript with plonging pangs
my rage shall never end.
With greater heat it shall reboyle,
like as the brutyshe beast,
Whose tyranye most horrible,
excedeth all the rest,
What gredye gapynge whyrle poole wide
what parlous gulphe vnmild,
What Sylla coucht in roryng rocks
or what Charybdes wild,
(That Sicil and Ioinum sea
by frothy waves does sup)
What Aetna bolking stifling flames,
and duskye vapors up,
(Whose heavy payse with stewyng heat
does smoldryng crushe beneath
Encelades, that fiery flakes
from choked throat does breath)
Can with such dreadful menaces
In swetyng furye frye?
No river swift no trowbled surge
Of stormye sea so hye,
Nor sturdy seas (whom rufling winds
with ragyng force to rore)
Nor puissant flash of fire, whose might
By boysteous blast is more,
May bide my angers violence:
my furye shall it foil:
His court I le over hourl, and lay
it leuel with the soil.
My Iasons heart did quake for fear
of Creon cruel kyng^
And lest the king of Thessalye
would war upon him bring.
But loyal love that hardens hearts
makes no man be afrighte.
But beet, that he conui^t has yeilde
him self to Creons might.
Yet once he might have vysyted^
and come to me his w^fe,
To talk, and take his last farewell.
if danger o^ his life
In doing this (hard hearted wretch
most cruel) he should fear,
He being Creons sonn^ in law,
for him it le^u^l were,
To have proroged somewhat yet
my heuye banishment,
To take my leave of ch^ldren twain
one only day is lent:
Yet do I not complain, as though
the time to short I thought^
As proof shall plain pronounce, to day,
to day, it shall be wroughte,
The memory whereof no tract
of time shall wype away.
With malice bent against the gods
my wrath shall them assay:
And rifling every thing, both good,
and bad, I will turmoyle.

Nu. Madame thy mind that troubled is,
and ^ost with such abroyle
Of swarming ills, thy vexed breast
now set at rest again,
The peuyshe fond affeccions all
of troubled mind refrain.

Me. Then only can I be at rest,
when every thing I see
Thrown hedlong topsie turuey down
to ruthful end with me.
With me let al things clean decay:
thy self if thou do spyll,
Thou may drive to destruction
what else with the thou will:

Nu. If in this follye styff thou stand
behold what after clappes
Ar to be feared, none dare contryue
for princes traynyng trappes.

Ia^on. Medea. O Luckles lot of froward fates
o cruel fortunes hap,
Both when she list to smite, or spare,
in woe she does us wrapp
A like, the salve that God has given
so often, to cure our grefe,
More noyeth then the sore it self,
and sends less relief:
If for her good desar^es to me
amendment I should make,
I hazard should my ventrous life
to lose it for her sake.
If I will shun my dismal day
and will not for her die,
Then want the love of loialtie
O wretched man must I.
No dastardes dread my stomak^ stout
can cause to droupe and shrynke,
But mere remorse appaulleth me,
when on my babes I think.
For why? when carfull parents are
ons reft of life and breath,
Sone after them there wretched seed
ar drawn to dolfull death.
O Sacred ryghteousnes (if thou
enjoy thy worthy place
In perfect bliss of happy heaven)
I call upon thy grace,
And the for witness here allege,
how for my chyldrens part
With pit pryckte I have committ
these things against my heart.
And so I think Medea her self
the mother rather had,
(Though francticklye as now she fares
with rage of heart so madd
And does abhor with paynfull yoke
of combrous cares to toil)
Her spousall bed, then that her seed
should take the plonging foil.
I did determine in my mind,
to go her to entreat
With gentle words, and pray her cease,
in fervent wrath to freate.
And lo^on me when ons she kaste
the beams of glauncinge eye,
Full blythe she leapes, she iumpes for joy,
in fittes she ginnes to frye.
Deep deadly blackish hate she seems
in out ward brow to bear,
And whollye in her frowning face
does glutting grefe appear.
Me. I packing, packyng, Jason am:
this still to chopp, and change
The fletynge soil of my abode,
to me it is not strange.
The cause of my departure yet
(to me is strange) and new.
I wonted was in following the
all places to eschew:
I will depart, and get me hence,
to whom for helpyng hand
Entendest thou to send us furthe,
whom hence so fly the land
Thou do compel with thine alies?
shall I repair again
To Phasis flood, to Colchis Isle,
or to my fathers raygne?
Or gorye swetyng feldes, that with
my brothers blood do reeke?
What harbring lands aloufe do tho^
command us out to seek?
What seas appoint ye me to pa^se?
shall I my i^urney drive,
Upon the parlous hateful jaws
of Pontus to aryue,
By which I did saufe conduct home
kings valaunt armies great,
Where roaring rocks with thundrynge noise
the flapping waves do beat,
Or on the naro^ wrackfull shore,
of Simplegades twain?
Or else to small Hiolcos town
can I return again?
Or toil, y^ gladsome pleasant lau^ds
Of Tempe to attain?
All places that I opened have
Unto thy passage free,
I shut them up against my self,
now whether sendest thou me?
A banysht wretch to banyshment
thou would have enclyne,
Yet to the place of her exyle
thou can not her assygne.
Yet for all that without delay
I must depart and go:
And why? for sothe the king his son
in law commands so.
Well: nothing will I stand against,
with grypes of passing pain
Let me be scourgde, of my desartes
such is the gotten gain.
Let Creon in his pryncely ruff
lay to his heavy hands,
To whyp an whore, in torments sharp,
with iron gyues, and bands
Let her be chaynd, in hydiouse hole
of night for aye her lock:
Let her be cloyed with pestryng payse
of restless rowlyng rock.
Yet less^ than I deserved have,
in all this shall I find:
O thou discourteous Gentleman,
consider in thy mind
The flamye puffes, and fyrye gaspes
of ghastly gapyng bull,
And Aetas catell rich with Fleece
of gorgious golden wool,
That went to graze amyd so great
and mighty fears in feylde,
Of uncontrolled nacyon,
whose soil does armies yeilde.
Revoke to mind the deadly darts
of suddayne startynge foe,
when ghastly warriors ( Tellus brood)
to ground again did go
through slaughter red of mutual lau^ce,
to this yet further pass,
The lurched Fleece of Phrixes Ram,
that all thine errand was.
And vgsome Argos slumberlesse,
whom fast I causde to keep
His werye watchyng wynkyng eyes
with vnaquaynted sleep.
My brother eke, whose fatal twyst
of feeble life I shred,
And gylt that wrought so many gyltes
when as with thee I fled.
The daughters whom I set on work
entrapte in wylye train,
To slaye their sire, that shall not rise
to quyckned life again.
And how to travel other realms,
I set mine own at naught.
By that good hope which of thy seed
conceived is in thought,
Eake by thy stable mancion place,
and myghtie monsters, that
Down beaten for thy health, I causde
before thy feet to squat,
And by these drudgyng hands of mine
vnspared for thy sake,
For dread of dangers ouerpas^
that caused thee to quake,
By heavens above, and seas below,
that witness bearers be,
To knyttyng of our marriage up,
thy mercy veil to me.
Of all the heaps of treasure great
so far of being fet,
Which A^tas savage Scythians
did travel for to get,
From Ind^ where Phoebus scorching blase
does dye the people black.
Of all this gold which in our bowers
we could not well compack,
But tryck and trym we garnyshed
our groves with gold so gaye,
I banysht wretch of all this stuff
gat naught with me away,
Except my brothers flaughtred flesh,
yet I employed the same
On thee: the cares of countries health
my honestye and shame.
My father, and my brother both
has yielded place to ^hee,
This is the dowrye that thou had
my wedded spouse ^o be.
To her whom thou d^est abrogate
restore her gooddes again.

Ia. When Cr^on in malycyous mood
had thought thee to have slain,
Entreated with my tear^s exyle,
and life he gave to thee.

Me. I took it for a ponyshment,
but surely as I see
This banyshment is now become
a freyndly good reward.

Ia. While thou have time to go be gone,
for most seueare, and hard
The kings dyspleasure ever is.

Me. Thus woldste thou dodge me out?
Thy hated trull cast of thou do
that please Creuse thou might.

Ia. Do thou Medea vpbrayde me with
the breach unkind of love?

Me. And slaughter vile with treachery
whereto thou did me move.

Ia. When al is done what can thou say
my gyltynes to stayne?

Me. Even whatsoever I have done.

Ia. Yet more this does remain:
That thy vngra^yous wyckednes
of harm should ^e accuse.

Me. Thine, thine, they are, they are al thine
what ever I did use.
Who yt of lewdnes reapes the fruit,
is grafter of the same.
Let every one with infamy
thy wretched spouse defame,
Yet do thou only take her part,
her only do thou call
A just and undefiled wight,
without offense at all.
If any man shall for thy sake
polute his hand with ill,
To thee let him an innocent
yet be accounted still.

Ia. The life is loathsome that does work
his shame who has it chose.

Me. the life whose choice does work thy shame
thou ought again to lose.

Ia. Let reason rule thy eger mind
so vexed with crabbed ire
And for thy tender chyldrens ease
to be at rest req^yre

Me. I do defye it, wholly I
detest it, I forswear,
That brethren bred unto my barnes
Creusas womb shall bear.

Ia. It will be trym, when as a Queen
of majesty and might
Has issue, kinn unto the seed
of the a banished wight.

Me. So cursed day shall neu^r on
my wretched children shine
To myngle base borne basterdes with
the blood of noble lygne.
Shall Ph^bus stock (that bears y^ lamp
of heaven in starrye throne)
Be macht with drudginge Sisi^hus
that roules in hell the stone?

Ia. What meanest you wretch both the and m^
in banishement to yoke?
I pray the^ hence:

Me. When humbly I
my mind to Creon broke,
He gave an ear unto my suit,

Ia. What lies in my might
To do for the?

Me. If no good turn
then do thy worst dispyght.

Ia. On this side with his swerd in hand
King Creon does me scar:
On other part with armed host
Acast does me detarr.

Me. Medea eke to coape with these,
that more apaull us may:
Go to, to skyrmyshe let us fall
Let Ias^n be the pray:

Ia. I yield whom sore aduersyties
have tyerd with heavy swaye.
Learn thou to dred thy luclesse lost
that often does thee assaye.

Me. I evermore have ruled the swinge
of fortunes waueryng will.

Ia. Achastus is at hand and nygh
is Creon the to spyll:

Me. Take y^ thy heles to escape them both,
I do not the advice,
That thou against thy father in law
In traytrous arms should rise.
Nor in Achas^ thy c^sens blood
thy woundyng hands to gore,
The vol^es unto Medea made,
do trowble the so ^ore.
While yet y^ have not spylt there blood
yet, fly, with me a way.

Ia. when armies twain their banners o^
Defiance shall dysplaye,
And marchyng ^urthe in fylde to fight
s^ke battle at my hand,
Who then for us encounter shall
their puyssa^ce to wythstand?

Me. If Cr^on and Acastus king
encampe to gether shall^
Admit that these in one with them
should join there powers all
My Contreymen of Cholchis I Will,
and A^tas lustye king,
Suppose the Scythians join with Greeks,
to ground I will them bring,
Clean put to foil.

Ia, The puissant power
of hawty mace I fear

Me. Take heed, lest more thou do affec^e
the same, then for to clear,
Thy self of Creons servile yoke,

Ia. Least some suspicion grow.
Of this our tatlynge long here let
us make an end and go.

Me. Now Jove hurl out thy flames and
thy thundering ^olts to fly,
With fiery drakes bright brandishing force
disparst in burning sky:
Strain forth thy dreadful thretning arm,
dispose in due array
The tossyng dynt of lyghtnyng flashe,
that wrecke our quarrel may.
With rumblynge crack of rentynge clowd
cause all ye world to quake,
And level not thy houeryng hand
to stryke with fyrye flake
Upon my pasht and crushed corpse,
or Iasons carcas slain:
For whether of us thou smite to death
his dew reward shall gain,
thy thumps of thwacking boltes on us
amiss they cannot light.

Ia. Fie, let thy mind on matters run
that seem a modest wyghte.
And use to have more cherfull talk,
if any thing thou crave,
Within my fathers house to ease
thy flight, thou shall it have.

Me. thou know my mind both can, and eke
is wont, to do no less,
Then to contemn the bryttell wealth
that Princes do possess.
This, this shall be the only boon
that at thy hand I crave,
As mates with me in banyshmente,
my children let me have,
That restyng on their syghing breasts
my careful mournyng head,
I may my crystal ^^arye streams
into their bosoms shed.
But as for thee, new gotten sons
of wife new wed do stay.

Ia. I grant that unto thy request
I wysh I might obey:
But nature me with pytye pryckes,
that needs I must deny.
For though both Creon and Achast,
in torments force me lie,
I could not yield unto their wylles:
on this my life does rest:
In times of tears, this is the joy
of dull afflycted breast
For better far I can abide
the want of vital breath,
And succor of my lymmes, or loose,
the light of world by death.

Me. What love unto his selye babes
is depely grafte in him?
This works well I have him trypt^
lo now there lies brymme.
An open place whearbie receive
a vennye soon he may.
Let me or I depart, unto
my selye children say.
These lessons of my last adewe,
and grant to me the space,
With tender grype of collyng last
their loving lymmes ^embrace:
This will be comfort to my heart:
yet at the latter wo^rde
I ask no more but only that
you should me this afoorde.
If eger anguysh cause my tongue
to cast out words unkind,
Let al thing fly, let nothing be
Engraued in your mind
But let rem^mbrau^ce otherwhyle
of me to touch your thought,
Let other things be wypte away
that byle of wrath has wrought.

Ia, I have forgotten every whit
god grant thou may of shake
These surging qualmes of frownced mind
and mylder may it make:
For quyetnes does work their ease
that dented are with woe:

Me. What is he slyl^e slypt and gone?
falls out the matter so?
O Jason do thou sneake away,
not having mind of me,
Nor of those former great good turns
that I have done for the?
With the now am I clean forgott:
but I will bring about
That from thy careful sighing mind
shall not be banysht out:
Apply to bring this to effect,
call home thy wits again,
And all thy wily fetches far,
each artifycyall train.
This is the perfect fruit that may
to the of myschefe spring,
To presuppose that myschefe is
not graft in any thing.
Scante have I oportunyt^e
for my pretensed guyle,
Because we are mystrusted sore,
But try I will the while
To set upon them in such sort,
as none can deem my sleyghte:
March forth, now venture on, fall to,
both what lies in thy might,
And also what does pass thy power.
O faith full nourse and mate.
Of all my heavy heart breakyng,
and diverse cursed fate,
Come help our simple mean device.
remaynyng yet I have
A robe of Pall the present that
our heavenly graundsyre gave,
Chief monument of Cholchis I Will,
which Phoebus did bestow
On Etas for a pledge, that him
his father h^ might know.
A precious fulgent gorget eake,
that brauelye glytters bright,
And with a seamlye shynyng seame
of golden thrydes is dyght,
Through wrought between the row of pirles
do stand in borders round
Wherwyth my golden crispen locks
is wonted to be crounde.
My little children they shall bear
these presents to the Bryde,
That first with slybber ^^abbar sosse
of chauntmentes shall be tried.
Request the aid of Hecate
in redynes prepare
The lamentable sacryfyce,
upon the bla^dye Aare.
Enforce the fyers catchyng houlde
upon the rafters hye
With crackling nois of flamie sparks
rebounde in azur sky.

Chorus.
NO fyers force, nor rumb^yng cage
of boysteous blustryng wind,
No darte shot why^ling in the skyes^
such terror to the mind
Can drive, as when the ^re^ull wife
does boil in burning hate,
Depryued of her spo^sall bed,
and comfort of her mate,
Nor where the stormye southern wind
with dankysh dabbye face,
Of horye winter sends out
the gusshyng shooores apace.
where veighment Isters waumbling stream
comes walterynge down amayn,
Forbyddyng both the banks to me^^e,
and cannon often contain
Him self w^thin his channels scou^e,
but further breaks his way,
Nor Rodanus who^e russhyng stream
does launche into the sea,
Or when amydde the floured spring
with hotter burning son,
The wynters snowes disolued with heat
down to the ryuers run:
The clottred top of Haemus hill
to water thynne does turn,
Such desperate gogyn flame is wrath
that inwardly does burn,
And modest rule regards not,
nor brydels can abide,
Nor dreading death, does wysh on di^te
of naked blade to slide.
O Gods be gracyous unto us,
for pardon we do crave,
That him who tamde the scuffling waves,
vouchsafe ye would to save.
But Neptune yet the Lord of S^as
with frownyng face will lower,
That over his second scepter men
to tryumphe have the power.
The boy that rashlye durst att^mpt
that great v^weldye charge
Of Phoebus everlasting carte,
and ^ouyng out at large,
Not bearyng in his recklesse breast
his fathers warnynges wise
Was burned with the flames which he
did scatter in the skies.
None knew the costlye glymsyng glades,
where stragglynge Phaeton rode,
Pass not the path, where people safe
In formar ^yme have trod.
O fond^ynge, wylfull, wanton boy,
do not dyssolue the frame
Of heaven, sith Jove with sacred hand
has hallowed the ^rame.
Who rowde with valyante oa^es tough^,
that were for Argo made,
Has powled na^ed Pel^on mount
of thycke compacted shade.
Who entered has the flerynge rocks
and s^rched o^t the t^yle
And tyrynge travels of the s^as^
and has on saluage soil
^nyt fast his stretched cable rope,
and goinge fourth to land.
To cloyn away the foren gold
with gredye snatchyng hand.
Unto the seas (because that he
transgres^ their l^wes deuyne)
By this unlucky end of his

The troubled seas of t^eyr vnrest^
for vengeance howl and w^epe.
Sir Typhis who did conquer fyrst^

Has yielded up the con^ynge rule
of his vnw^ldye st^rne,
To such a guide, as for that use
has need as yet to learn.
who gyuyng up his gohste aloof

In forreyn ^ore lies buried vyl^

He syts among the flyttrynge souls

And Aulis Isle that in her mind
her masters loss does bear,
Held in the sh^ppes, to stand and w^yl^
in crokyng narrow nooke:
That Orpheus Cal^^iops son
who st^yd^ the runnynge b^ook^,
while he records on hea^^nly Harp^
with twancklynge finger ^yne,
The wyn^e ^ay^ down his pipling (...)
his harmonye diuin^
Procurde the woods to styr them selves,
and trees in eraynes alonge
Came forth, with byrds that held their lays
and lystned to his song.
with lyms on sunder rent in fe^lde
of Thrace he lies ded.
Up to the top of Heber flood
eke hal^d was his head.
Gone down he is to Stygian dam^es.
which seen he had before,
And Tartar boylyng pyttes, from whenc^

Alcydes bangyng bat did bring
the Northern laddes to ground.
To Achelo of sundry shapes
he gave his mortal wound.
Yet after he could purchase piece
both unto sea and lande`
And after Ditis dungeon black
rent open by his hand,
He living spread him self along^
on burning O^tas hill:
His members in his prop^r flame
the wretch did thr^ste to spyll:
His blood he brewd with Nestors blood,
and lost his loathsome life
By traytrus gift that poisoned shyrte
received of his wy^e.
with tuske of brystl^d groy^yng bore
Anceus lyms were torn.
O Mel^ager (wicked wight)
to grave by thee ^ere borne
Thy mothers brethren twain, and she,
for it with ruthful hand
H^th wrought thy doleful destenye
to burn thy fatal brande.
The rash attemptyng Argonantes
deserved all the death
That Hylas whom Alcides lost
be^eft of fadyng br^a^h.
That springall which in sowsyng (...)
of wat^rs drowned was:
Go now ye lustye bloods, the seas:
with doubtful lot to pass.
Though Idmon had the calking skyll
of destenyes before,
The Se^pent made him l^ue his lyf^
in tomb of Liby shoore.
And Mopsus that to other men
could well their fates ^scrye,
Yet only did deceive him self
uncertain wheare to dye,
And he that could the secret hap
of things to come unfold,
Yet dyed not in his country Thebes.
Dame Thetis husband oulde
Did wander like an outlawde man.
Our Palimedes sire
Did hedlonge wholme him self in seas,

From Troy, to rushe on rocks did them

Stout Ajax O^lens did sustayn^

And cruel storm of surgyng seas,

That by his country was commit,

A leeste to redeem her husbands
Phereus life from death^
The godly wife upon her spouse

Proud Pelias that wretch him s^lf^

Enough, enough, revenged are
o Gods the wrongs of seas,
Be good to Jason, doing that

The fourth Act.
Nutrix. MY shyuerynge mind amazed is,
agaste, and sore dysmayde:
My chyllysh lyms with quakyng cold
do tremble all afraid.
Such plagues and vengeance is at hand
in what excedyng wise
Do sharp assaults of gredye grief
still more and more arise,
And of it self in smotheryng breast
enkyndles greater heat?
Often have I seen how rampyng rage
has forced her to freate.
With frantickfyts, mad, bedlem wise
against the Gods to rail,
And eke bewytched gohstes of heaven
in plungyng plagues to trayle:
But now Medea beats her busy
brain to bring to pass
A myscheyfe greater, greater far,
then ever any was.
Ere while when hence she trypt away
astonyshed so sore,
And of her poison closset close
she entered had the door:
She powers out her jewels all,
abroad to light she brynges
That which she dreadyng lothed long,
most irksome vglye things:
She mumblyng coniures up by names
of illes the rabble rowte,
In hugger mugger cowched long,
kept close, vnserched out:
All pestlent plagues she calls upon,
what ever Libie land,
In frothy boylyng stream does work,
or muddye belchynge sand:
What teryng torments Taurus bredes,
with snowes vnthawed still
Where winter flawes, and hory froste
knyt hard the craggy hill,
She lays her crossynge hands upon
each monstrus coniurd thing,
And over it her magic verse
with charmyng does she sing:
A mowsye, rowsye, rustye route
with cancred scales y^lad
From mustye, fustie, dustye dens
where lurked long they had,
Do ^raull: a walowing ^arpent houge
his combrous corpse out draggs,
In fierye fomyng blaryng mouth
his forked tongue he wagges.
He stares about with sparklyng eyes,
if some he might espy,
Whom snapping at with stinging spit
he might constrayne to dye:
But hearing once the magycke uerse
he hushed as all a gast,
His body boalne byg, wrapped in lumps
^n twynyng knotes he cast.
And wamblynge to and fro his tail
in lynkes he row^es it round.
Not sharp enough (quoth she) y^ plages
and tools that holow grownd
Engenders for my purpose ar,
to heaven up will I call,
To reach me stronger poison down,
to frame my fea^ with all.
Now is it at the very point,
Medea thou assaye.
To bring about sum farther fetch,
then common wyches may.
Let down, Let down, that sprawlyng snake
that does his body spread,
As does a runnyng broke abroad
his mighty channel shed.
Whose swellyng knobes of wondrous sise
and boysteus bobbing bumpes
Does thumpe the great and lesser bear
that feel his heavy lumpes.
The bygger bear with golden glede
the greekishe fleet does guide:
But by the less the Sidon shypps
their passage have espied.
He that with pinche of gripyng fyste
does bruise the adders twain,
His strenyng hard and claspyng hand,
let him vnknitt again.
And crushe their squeased venom out,
com further thou our charm
O flymie serpent Python, whom
dame Juno sent to harm
Diana and Apollo both,
(those heavenly spyrytes twain)
With whom Latona trauelynge
did groan with pynchyng pain.
O Hydra whom in Lerna poole
Alcides gave the foil,
And all the noysom vermen vile
that Hercules did spoil.
Which when on sunder they were cut
with slysyng deadlye knyfe,
Can knyt again there sodred parts,
and so recover life.
Help wakefull Dragon Argos^ whom
first magic words of mine
Made Morpheus lock thy sleppe liddes
and shut thy slurgynge eyes.
Then having brought above the ground
of serpents all the row^e,
Of fylthy wedes the ranckest bane
she pyckes. and gathers out,
That spryng on kno^tye Eryx hill
where passage none is found,
Among the ragged rocks, or what
on Caucasus his ground
Does grow that still is clad in cote
of horye morye froste.
That evermore vnmelt abydes,
whose spattred fylde is soste
With g^bbs of blood, yt spowteth from
Prometheus gapyng maw,
Whose gutts with twitching tale^t out
the gastlye grype does draw.
Or any other venomous herb
among the Medes that grows,
that with their sheafe of arrows sharp
in fylde do scar their foes.
Or what the light held Parthian
to serve her turn can send,
Or else the rich Arabians,
that dyp their arrows end
In poison ^tronge: the joyce of all
Medea o^t does wrynge,
That underneath the frosen poale
In swe^ia land does spring.
Whose noble state Hircinus wood
do the high enhaunce and rear.
Or what the plea^au^te soil does yield
in pryme of smiling vere,
When nature byddes the byrd begin
her shrowdyng nest to build,
Or when the chursyshe Boreas blast
sharp winter has exild,
The trym array of branche and bough
to cloth the naked tree,
And every thing with bitter could
of snow con^ealed be.
In any pestylent flower on stalk
of any herb does grow,
Or noisome joyce does ly in rotten
writhen rotes allow,
Has any force in breadyng bane,
those takes she in her hand.
Sum plagye herbs did Athos yeald
that mount of Thessayle land.
And other Pindus roches hye
and sum upon the top
Of Pingeus, but tender twyggs
the cruel sithe did l^pp:
These Tigris river noryshte up,
that chokes his whyrlpoale deep
With stronger stream. Danubius those
in fostryng wave did keep.
Those did Hidaspus mynister,
who by the parchyng zone
With luke warm silver chanel runes,
so rich with precious stone.
And Bethis son, who gave the name
unto his country great,
And with his shallowe fourd against
the Spanyshe seas does beat
This herb abode the edge af knyfe
in danwnynge of the day
Or Phoebus face began pepe, bedecte
with glyttryng goulden spraye
His slender stalk was snepped of
in deep of sylent night,
His corn was cropped, while she with charm
her po^sned nails did dight.
She chops the dedlie herbs, and wrings
the squesed clottered blood
Of serpents out: and filthy byrds
of irksom mirye mud:
She tempers with the same and eake:
She brayes the heart of owl
Foreshewing death with glaring eyes
and moapyng visage foul
Of shr^ke oule hoarce alive she takes
the durtye stynkyng guts,
Al these the framer of this feate
in diverse percels puttes.
This has in it deuouryng force
of gredye spoylynge flame,
The frosen eysye dullyng could
engenders by the same.
She chantes on those ye magic verse,
that works no lesser harm,
With bustling fra^tickelie she stampes,
and cease not to charm.

MEDEA. O Flittring flocks of grisly gostes
that sit in sylent seat
O ougsum buggs o gobblyns grym
of hell I you entreat:
O lowryng Chaos dungeon blind,
and dreadful darkened pytt,
Whear Ditis muffled up in clouds
of blackest shades does sytt,
O wretched woeful wawlyng souls
your ayed I do implore,
That linked lie with ginglyng chains
on waylyng Limbo shore,
O mo^sye den where death does couche
his ghastly carrayn face:
Releas your panges o spryghtes, and to
this weddyng hye apace.
Cause ye the snaggye whele to pawse
that rentes the carkas bound,
Permit Ixions racked lymmes
to rest upon the ground:
Let hungry bytten Tantalus
with gawnt and pyned panch^
Soupe up Pirenes gulped stream
his swellyng thyrst to stawnche.
Let burning Creon bide the brunt
and gyrdes of greater pain,
Let payse of slypperye slydyng stone
type over back again
His moylynge father Sisyphus,
among the craggye rocks.
Ye daughters dyre of Danaus
Whom perced pychers morkes
So often with labor lost in vain
this day does long for you
That in your life with bloodye blade
at once your husband slew.
And thou whose aares I honored have
o torche and lamp of night,
Approach o lady mine with most
deformed vysage dyght:
O three fold shapen dame that knitst
more threatnyng brows then on,
Acco^dyng to the country guyse
with daglyng locks undone
And naked foot, the secret grove
about I hallowed have,
From duskye dry vnmoystye clouds
the showers of rain I crave.
Through me ye chinked gaping ground
the soked seas has drunk,
And mayner stream of thocian flood
beneth the earth is sunk,
that swelteth out through holow gulf
with stronger gushyng rage.
The^ were his suddy wamblyng waves
whose power it does assuage
the heavens with wrong disturbed course
and out of order quyte,
The darkened son, and gli^mering stars
at once has showed their light,
and dre^ched Charles his straggling waine
has ducte in dasshyng wave,
The framed course of roamyng time
racte out of frame I have.
So my enchau^tments have it wrough^
that when the flaming son
In so^mer bakes the parched soil
then has the twigs begone,
with sprowting blossom fresh to blome'
and hastye winter corn
Has out of harvest seen the fruit
to barnes on suddeyn borne.
Into a shallowe foorde his sture
dystreame has Phasis wast
And Isters channel being in
so many branches cast,
Abated has his wrackfull waves,
on every sylent shore
He lies calm: The iumbled flooddes
with th^ndryng noise did rore,
When couched close the wyndes were
not moving pipp^ing soft,
With workyng wave the prauncynge seas
have swollen and leapt aloft,
Whereas the wood in alder time
with thyck and braunched bow
did spread his shade on gladsome soil
no shade remains now.
I rollynge up the magic verse
at noone time Phaebu^ stay,
Amyd the darkened sky, when fled
was light of drowsye day
Eke at my charm the watery flocks
of H^yads went to glade.
Time is it Phaeba to respect
the service to thee made:
To thee with cruel blooddye hands
these garlandes grene were twind
Which with his foldyng circles nine
the serpent rowgh did bynd.
Have here Tipho^as flesh, that does
In Etnas furnace groan,
That shake with batterye vyolent
king Jove's assalted trone.
This is the Centaures poysened blood
which Nessus vylia^ne vile
Who made a rape of Dianire
entendynge her to fyle,
Bequethed her when newlye wound
he gaspynge lay for breath,
While Hercles shaft stack in his ribbs,
whose lawnce did work his death:
B^holde the funeral cinders hear
which up the poison dried
Of Hercul^s who in his fire
on Oeta mountain dyed:
Lo here the fatal brande, which late
the fatal systers three
Conspyred at Mel^agers birth,
such should his destnye be,
To save alive his brethyng corpse,
while tha^ might hole remain,
Wh^che safe his mother Alte kept,
till he his uncles twain,
(That from Atlanta would have had
the head of Conquered Bore,)
Had reft of life whose spytefull death
Althea took so sore,
That both she showed her feruentnes
in systers godly lous,
When to revenge her brothers death
mere nature did her move,
But yet as mother most unkind
of nature most vnmylde,
To hasten the untimely grave
of her beloved child,
While Mel^ages ^atall brande
she wasted in the flame,
Whose swelting guts and bowels moult
consumed as the same,
These plumes the Harpyes raueninge fowls
for have did leave behind,
In hidden hole whose cloase access
no mortal wight can find.
When fast from Zethes chasyng them
with spedye flight they fled.
Put unto these the feathers which
the Stymphall bird did shed,
Whom duskyng Phoebus dymned light
sir Hercules did stynge,
And galled with the shafte, that he
in Hydraes hyde did flynge.
You Aares have yield a clattryng noise
I know, I know of old,
How unto me my Oracles
are wonted to be could,
That when the tremblyng flower does shake
then has my Goddess great,
Uouchfafe to grant me my request
as I did her entreat.
I see Dianas waggyn swyfe,
not that whereon she glydes
When all the night in darkened sky
with face full open she rydes:
with cou^tenau^ce bright and blandishyng
but when with heavy cheer,
With duskie shi^mering wannie globe,
her lamp does pale appear.
Or when she trots about the heauens^
with horsehead rayned strait,
When Thessayle wytches with the threats
of c^armynge her do bayte.
So with thy dumpysh dulled blase,
thy clowdye faynting light,
Send out, amyd the lowryng sky,
the heart of people smite
With agonyes of suddeine dread,
in strange and fearful wise,
Compel the precious brazen pannes
with iarryng noise to rise
Through Corinth contrye every where,
to shylde the from this harm,
lest hedlong drawn thou be from h^auen
to earth by force of charm.
An holy solemn sacryfyce
to worship the we make,
Imbrewed with a blooddye turphe
the kindled torche does take
Thy sacred burning night fire at
the dampishe morie grave.
Sore charged with thy trowbled ghost
my head I shaken have,
And du^kyng down my neck allow
with shrykyng loud have shright,
And groueling flat on floor in trau^ce
have lain in dead man's plight.
My tuffled locks about mine ears
down daglyng have been bownde
Tuckt up about my temples twain
with gladsome garland ^rownd:
A drerye branche is offered the
from filthy stigis flood.
As is the guise of Bacchus prestes
the Coribanthes wood,
With naked breast and dugges laid out
I Will prycke with sacred blade
Mine arm, that for the bubling blood
an issue may be made,
with trilling streams my purple blood
let drop on Thalter stones:
My tender chyldrens crusshed flesh
and broken broosed bones
Learn how to brook with hardened harte^
in practyse put the ^rade
To florysh fearce, and keep a coil,
with naked glyttrynge blade:
I spryncl^d holy water have,
the lance once being made,
If tired thou complaynest that
my cries thee ouerlade,
Give pardon to my ernest suit,
o Perceus sister dear,
Still Jason is the only cause
that urges me to rear
with squeking voice thy noisome beams,
that stynge like shot of bow.
So season thou those sawced robes
to work Creusas woe,
Wherwt when she shall pranke her self
the poison by and by
To rotte her in ward marye out,
within her bones may fry,
The secret fire bleares their eyes
with gloss of yealow gold,
The which Prometheus gave to me
that fire fylcher bold.
On whom for robbery that he did
in heavens above commyt,
With massy payse great Caucasus
thunweldye hill does sit,
Where under with unwasted womb
he lies, and pays his pain,
To feed the cra^myng foul with gubbes
of guts that grows again.
He taught me with a pretye sleyght
of connyng, how to hyde
The strength of fire close kept in,
that may not be espied,
This lively tinder Mulciber
has forged for my sake,
That tempred is with brymston quick
at first touch and take.
Eke of my cosen Phacton
a wyld fire flake I have
His flames the monstrous stagharde rough^
Chimera to me gave,
In head and breast a Lion grymme,
and from the rump behind
He swepes the flower with laggyng tail
of Serpent force by kind.
In rybbes and loins along his paunche
yshaped like a Got.
these fumes that out the bull perbrakt^
from fyrye spewing throat,
I gotten have and brayd it with
Medusas bitter gall
Co^maundyng it in secret sort
to duske and cover all:
Breath on these venoms Hecate
with deadly might inspyre,
Preserve the touching poulder of
my secret covert fire,
O grant that these my cloked crafts
so may bewytch their eyes,
That lykelyhood of treason none
that may herein surmyse:
So work that they in handlyng it
may feel no kind of heat:
Her stewing breast, her sethyng veins,
let fervent fire freate
And force her roasted pynyg lymmes,
to drop and melte away,
Let smoke her rotten broylyng bones:
inflame this bryde to day
To cast a light with greater glede
on fryseled blasynge hear
Then is the shynyng flame that does
the weddyng torches bear.
My suit is hard, thryse Hecate
a dreadful barkyng gave
From doleful cloud a sacred flash
of flamye sparks she drove.
Each poisons pride fulfilled is:
Call furthe my children dear,
By whom unto the cursed Bryde
these presents you may bear:
Go furthe, go furthe my little babes,
your mothers cursed fruit,
Go, go, employ your pains with brybe
and earnest humble suit
To purchase grace, and eke to earne
you favor in her sight.
That both a mother is to you,
and rules with Ladies might.
Go on, apply your charge apace
and hye you home again,
That with embracyng you I may
my last farewell attain.

Chorus.
WHat ^^arpe assaults of cru^ll Cupydes flam^
With gyddie head thus tosseth to and froe,
This bedlem wight, and dyuelysh des^ret dame
what rouyng rage b^e pryckes to work this woe?
Rough rancours byle con^eales her trosen face,
Her hawtie brest^ bumbasted is with pride,
She shakes her head, she stalks with statelye pace,
She threats our king more then does he betyde.
who would her deem to be a banysht wight,
whose ska^let cheeks do glowe with rosye red?
In fayntyng face with pale and wannye whyght
The sa^guy^^ hew exyled thence is f^ed.
Her chaungyng lok^s no color lo^g^ can hold,
Her s^iftyng^ fete still trauasse to and ^^oe.
Even as the f^arce and t^^^nyng T^ge^ old^
That dot^ unware his suckyng whe^^es fo^goe,
Does rampe, and rage, most eger f^ce and ^ood,
Among the shrubb^s and bu^shes that do ^ ^owe
On Ganges st^onde that goldensanded blood,
whose silver str^ame through India does flow^.
Eu^n s^ M^dea sometime wantes her wytt^s
To rule the rage of her unbridled ^^e,
Now Venus son wyt^ ^usye frowa^d fyts,
Now wrath and l^u^, enkyndle both the fire.
what shall she do? when will this heinous wight
with fo^worde fo^e be packyng hence away,
From Gre^c^? to ea^e our realm of ter^our quyght,
And princes twai^^ whom she so sore does fraye:
Now ^haebus lodge thy Charyot in the w^ste,
Let nether raines nor bridle stay thy race,
Let groue^ing lyg^t with dul^e at night oppreste
In clokyng cloud^s wrapped up his muffled fac^,
Let H^sperus the la^desman of the night,
In western flood drenche deep the day so bright.
The.v. Act.
Nuntius. Chorus. Nutrix. Medea^ Jason. Nun. ALl things are ^opsy turuy turned,
and wasted clean to naught
To passing great calamy^ye
our kingdom state is brought
The syer and daughter burnte to duste
in blendred cynders lie.

Cho. what train ha^h the^ entrapt?

Nu^ such as
are made for kings to dye,
False tra^trusse gifts.

Cho. what privy guile
could wrapped be in those?

Nun. And I do marvel at this thing
and skante I can suppose
that such a mischeife might be wrought
by any such deuyce

C^o, Report how this dystruction
and ruin should arise

Nun. The fyzzinge ^lame most egerlye
dath scour with swepynge swaye
Each corner of the princes court,
as though it should obaye
Commanded thereunto so f^at
on flower the pallayce falls:
We are in dread least further it
will take the townysh walls.

Cho. Cast quenchyng water on it then
to slake the gredye ^lame.

Nun. And this that seems very strange
do happen in the same,
The water fedes the fire fast,
the more that we do toil
It to suppress, with hotter rage
the heat begyngs to boil:
Those things that we have gotten for
our help it does enjoy.

Nut. Medea thou that do so sore
king Pelops land anoye,
Twine hence in have thy forward foot,
at all assayes depart
To any other kind of coast.

Me. can I find in my heart
To shun this land? if hence I had
first fallen away by flight,
I would have traueled back again,
to gase at such a sight.
To stand and se this wedding new
why stayest thou dotyng mind?
Apply, apply, thy sore attempt,
that good sucesse does find.
What great exployt is this, that thou
of vengeance do enjoy?
Still art thou blinded witless wench
with vale of Venus boy?
Is this suffisaunce for thy grefe?
is root of rancour ded,
If Jason lead a syngle life
in solytary bed?
Some netling, thornie, stinging plages
vnpractysed deuyse:
Prepare thy self in redynes
and fall to on this wise:
Let all be fyshe that commes to net,
have no respect of right,
From mind on myschefe fixed fast
let shame be banysht quyt:
The vengeance they received at
my little chyldrens hand,
Is nothing worth: in ernest ire
ententyue must thou stand.
When heat of wrath begins to cool
cheer up thy self again:
Raise up those touches old that wonted
were in the to raygne,
That buried deep in breast do lie:
and as for all the same
That yet is wrought. of godlyn^sse
let it usurp the name^
Do this and I shall teach them learn,
what tryflyng cast it was,
And common practiced flymflam tryck
that erst I brought to pass.
By this my ragyng maladye
a preamble has made,
To show what howgier heaps of harms
shall shortly them invade
What durst my rude unskillful hand
assaye that was of wayght?
What could the mallyce of a gyrle
invent her foes to bayte?
Still conversant with wicked feats
Medea am I made.
My blunt and dulled brains has so
ben beat about this trade:
O so I joy, I joy, that I smot of
my brothers head,
And slasht his members of^eak that
from parents ^and I fled:
And filched have the privy fleece
lo Mars that sacred was.
It glads my heart that I to bring
old Pelias death to pass.
Have set his douggters all on work,
O grief pick out away
Not any guilt thou shall with vnacqueinted
hand assaie
Against whom wrath entendest thou
to bend thine Irefull might?
Or with what weapon do thou mean
thy traitorous foes to smite?
I know not what my wrathful mind
consulted has within
And to bewraie it to him self,
I dare not yet begin.
O rash and unadvised fool,
I make to hasty speed:
O that my foe had gotten of
his harlots body seed:
But what so ever thou by him
enioyest, suppose the same
To be Creusas babes of them
let her euioy the name.
This vengeance this does like me well
good reason is their why
The last attempt of yls, thou must
with stomach stout apply.
Alas ye little selie fools
that erst my children were,
The plaging price of fathers fault
submyt your selves to bear
O, horror huge with sudden stroke
my heart does ouercom
with ysie dullynge cold conieald
my members all benum.
My shiueryng lims appauled sore
for ghastly fear do quake,
And banished rage of malice hot
begins it self to flake:
The hateful heart of wife against
her Spouse has yielded place,
And pityous mothers mercy mild
restores natures face.
O shall I shed their giltlesse blood?
shall I the frame unfold
Of that, which loving natures hand
has wrought in me her mould?
O doty^g fury change thy mind,
conceive a better thought,
Let not this heinous savage deed
by means of me be wrought.
What crime have they (poor fools) commit
for which they should abye?
Upon their father Jason right
all blott of blame should lie.
Medea yet their mother I
am worser far then he
Tush let them frankly go to wrack,
no kith nor kyn to me
They a^: dispache them out of hand
hold, hould^ my babes they be
God wot most harmless lambs they are,
no crime nor fault have they
Alas they be mere innocents
I do not this denaye:
So was my brother whom I slew:
o falce reuoltyng mind
Why do thou staggryng to and fro
such change of fancyes find?
Why is my face be sprent with tears
what makes me falter so,
That wrath and love with striving thoughts
do lead me to and fro?
Such fyghting fancyes bickeryng storms
my swaruyng mind detar,
As when between ye wrestling winds
is raised wranglyng war,
Each where the tumbling walloinge waves,
ar hoist and reared hye
Amyd the iustlyng swolues of seas
that whot in ^urye frye:
Even so my heart with struggling thoughts
now synkes, now swells ama^n,
Wrath sometime chaseth virtue out
and virtue wrath again.
O yield the yield, a grysyng grefe,
to virtue yield the place:
Thou only comfort of our stock
in this afflicted case,
Come hither comdere loved impe
with collyng me embrace,
While that by me your mother dear
sweet Boys ye are enjoyed
So long god grant your father may
you keep from harm vncloyd
Exile and flight approach on me,
And they shall by and by
Be pulled perforce out of mine arms,
with vapourd weping eye
Sore languishing with moorning heart
yet let them go to grave
Before their fathers face as they
before their mothers have:
Now rancorus grefe with fiery fits
begins to boil again,
The quenched coals of dedly hate
do fressher force attain.
The rustye rancour harbred long
within my cancred breast
Startes up, and stirs my hand anew
in myscheife to be pressed.
O that the rablement of brattes
which swarmde about the side
Of Niobe that scornful dame
who perysht by her pride
Had taken life out of his lymmes.
o that the fates of heaven
A fruytefull mother had me made
of children seven and seven.
My barreyne womb ^or my revenge
has yielded little store
Yet for my sire and brother, twain
I have, their needs no more:
who^ seek this rufflyng rowt of feendes
with gargell vysage dyght;
Where will they deal their stripes, or whom
with whyps of fire smite?
Or whom with cruel scorching brand
and Stygian faggot fell,
with mischeife great to cloy, entendes
this army black of hell?
A choppyng Adder began to hiss
with wrethynges wrapped round,
As soon as did the lasshyng whyp
^^erte out with yerkyng sound.
whom bumping with thy rapping post
Megeta will thou crush?
whose ghost does here mishapt from hell
with scattered members rush?
My slautred brothers ghost it is
that vengeance coms to crave:
According to his dire request
due vengeance shall he have.
But flap thou fearce the fierbrandes
full dasshed in mine eyes,
Dig, rent, scrape, burn, and squea^ the^ out
lo open my breast it lies,
To fightyng furyes bobbyng strokes
O brother, brother bid
These royles, y^ prease to worrey me,
them selves away to rid.
Down to the silent souls allow
Not taking any care:
Let me be left hear by my self
alone, and do not spare.
To bast, and capperclaw these arms
that drew the blody blade:
To quench the furyes of thy sprite,
that thus do me invade,
With this rig^t hand the sacrifyce
on thalter shall be made.
What means this sudden tramplyng noise?
a band of men in Arms
Come bustlyng toward us, that m^
will cloy with ^eadly harms.
To end this slaughter set ^ppon
I will my self conuaye
Up to the garrets of our house,
come Nurce with me away,
Bestow thy body hence with me
from danger of our foes.
Now thus my mind on myscheife set
thou must thy self dyspose,
Let not the flyckeryng fame and praise
in darkness be exilde
Of stomach stoute^ that you did use
in murtherynge of thy child.
Proclayme in peoples ears the praise
of cruel blodye hand.

Ia. If any faithful man here be,
whom ruin of his land,
And slaughter of his prince do cause
in pensive heart to bleed,
step forth that ye may take the wretch
that wrought this deadly deed.
Hear, hear, ye iolye champyons
lay lode with weapons hear,
Have now, hoyst up this house, from low
foundacyon up it rear.

Me. Now, now my scepter guilt I have
recovered once again:
My fathers wrongs revenged are,
and eke my brother slain:
The gouldens cattels Fleece returned
is to my natyue land,
Possessyon of my realm I have
reclaymed to my hand:
Come home is my vi^gynitie,
that whilom went a straye.
O Gods as good as I could wysshe,
o joyful weddyng day,
Go shrowde thy self in darkness dim
dyspacht I have this feate:
Yet vengeance is not done enough,
to cool our thrystye heat.
O soul why do thou make delay?
why do thou doubtyng stand?
Go foreward with it yet thou may,
while doing is thy hand:
The wrath that might should mynister
does qualefye his flame:
The pryckes of sorrow twitch my heart
attaynt with blusshyng shame:
Through rygour of thy heinous gore
o wreatche what have thou done?
Though I repent a caytyfe vile
I am, to slay my son:
Alas I have committed it,
importunate delyght,
Still egged on my froward mind
that did against it fight:
And lo the vain coniecte of this
delyght increases still,
This only is the thing, that wantes
unto my wicked will,
That Iasons eyes should see this sight
as yet I do suppose
Nothing it is that I have done,
my travel all I lose,
That I employde in dyry deeds,
unless he see the same.

Ia, Lo hear she looks out, and leanes
upon the houses frame,
That pitchlong hanges with falling sway:
hear heap your fyers fast,
Whereby the flames that she her self
enkyndled, may her wast.

Me. Go Jason, go the o^^^ ryghtes
the wyndynge sheet and grave
Make redye for thy sonns, as last
behooves him to have,
Thy spouse and eke thy father in law
that are entomde by me
Received have the duties that
to ded men's ghostes agree.
This child has felt the dedly stroke
and lance of fatal knyfe,
And this with wal^some murder like
shall lose her tender life.

Ia. By all the sacred ghostes of heaven,
and by thy often exile,
And spousall bed, with breach of love
in me did not defyle,
Now spare, and sa^e the life of him
my child and also thine:
What ever crime committed is,
I grant it to be myne^
Make me a blodie sacri^ice
to dew deserved death,
Take from my synful guilty head
the use of vital breath.

Me. Nay since thou wylt not have it so
as greeues thy pynched mind,
Here way to wreck my vengeance ^ell
my burninge blade shall find.
Anaunt, now hence thou pesant proud
employ thy busye pain,
To reap the fruits of virgins bed,
and cast them of again
when mothers they are made.

Ia. let one
for dew revenge suffyce.
If gredye thryste of hungry hands
that still for vengeance cries,
Might quenched be with blood of one
then ask I none at all,
And yet to staunche my hongry grief
the number is to small,
If only twain I slay, if pleadge
of love lie secret made,
My bowels I Will vnbreste and search
my womb with pokynge blade.

Ia. Now fynysh out thy deadly deed,
that enterprysed is,
No more entrea^aunce will I use,
yet only grant me this,
Delay a while his doleful death,
that I may take my flight.
Least that mine ^yes with bledyng heart
should view that heavy sight.

Me. Yet linger eger anguyshe yet
to slay this child of thine.
Run not to rash with hastye speed
this doleful day is mine:
The ^yme that we obtained have
of Creon, we enjoy.

Ia. O vile malycyous minded wreache
my loathsome life dystroye.

Me. In craving this thou speak, that I
should show thee some relief,
Well goodynough, all this is done:
o ruthful gyddye grief,
This is the only sacryfyce
that I can thee provide,
Unthankful Jason hither cast
thy coyesh looks aside.
Lo hear do thou behold thy wife?
thus ever wonted I,
When murder I had made, to escape,
my way does open lie
That I may spring into the skyes^
the flyeng serpents twain
Submytted have their s^aly necks
to y^ke of ratlyng wayne,
Thou father have thy sons again
I in the wandryng sky,
In nymble wheled waggyn swyfte
will ride advanced hye.

Ia. Go through the ample spaces wide,
infecte the poisoned ayr^,
Bear witness grace of God is none
in place of thy repair.
