The remors of conscience.

Here begins certain demonstracyons by our lord to all sinful persons
with the remors of man's conscience to the regard of the bounte of our lord.





Deus. Our gracyous god most in magnyfycence
His merciful eyes casts from heaven on hy
Seeing his creatures in deedly vyolence
Himself complayneth by pity full ruthfully
Saying o man deuoyde of intellygence
Open thyn eeres unto my call and cry
And tell me if I have done to the offense
That thou forsakest me wyllyngly
Man such a love to the I did take
This world in seven days when I it wrought
Thou was the last thing that I did make
Because I would thou wanted naught
What thing the might help did not lake
That at thy need if it were sought
Foul / fysshe all thing for thy sake
For thy comfort all was forth brought
Moreover I gave the that dygnyte
All beestes to bow the until
I made the also like unto me
And gave the conning and free will
Me to serve that thou should se
To chose the good and leave the ill
I ask no thing again of the
But love thy sovereign as it is skyll
But unto this take thou none entente
Thou tournest fro me full unkindly
On loves unlawful thy love is lent
Thy heart beholds not heaven so hye
For all the goods I have the sent
The lysteth not ones to say gramercye
In time to come or thou repent
Man make amends or that thou dye

Homo. A christian soul conceived in sin
Received in conscience thus complaining
He fell down flat with doleful dynne
And said lord mercy sovereign king
I most unkind wretch of man kynne
I know I am thy traitor untrue in my living
This wicked life that I live in
I may it naught hyde from thy knowing
I want words and also wit
Of thy kyndnesse to speak a clause
That I have thou gave me it
Of thy goodness withouten cause
Though I have grieved the and do yet
Thy benefaytes thou naught withdrawse
I have deserved to have hell pytte
So have I lived against thy lawse
But forde thou know man's feblenesse
How frail it is and has been aye
For though the soul have thy lykeuesse
Man is but fulsome earth and claye
In sin conceived and wretchedness
And to the soul rebel always
First a man grows as does gresse
And he wastes after as flowers or hay
Sith man is than so frail a thing
And thy power so great in kind
This world is but a twynkelynge
Thou may destroy the might of the fend
With thy right lord mercy mynge
And to my sore salve thou send
Sore me repents of my mystyuynge
Mercy lord I will amend

Deus. Man I gave the bodyly hele
That thou should it spend in my service
Fayrenes also and fetures feel
Man what do thou with all these
Thou with delytes of the devil do dele
Which is to me a great despise
Thou lyuest a lecherous life vnlele
Fro year to year thou list not rise
Thou studyest after nyce array
And make great cost on thy clothing
To make the semely as who should say
Thou coudest amend my making
Thou purposest the day by day
To set my people to synnynge
Thy wretched will thou folowest always
What end sin has you thynkest no thing
In Noes time because of sin
And for lecherye in especyall
What vengeance came than to man's kynne
Save.viii. persons drowned were all
On sodom and gomor and the men within
How I made fire and brymstone fall
Fro heaven on them that bode therein
For sin were destroyed both great and small
Man wenest thou my might be less
Than it was than or that else I
Thou have now as much wickedness
As when I smote the most pyteousty
But if thou will thy fautes redress
Though I now spare for my mercy
Man think on my ryghtwysnesse
And make amends or that thou dye a.iii.

Homo. I wot well lord ryghtfull thou art
And that sin must be punyshed need
But one thing holds in hope my heart
Thy mercy paseth my mysdede
I know well that I may not sterte
I have so done me ought to dread
With beauty and with hodely quarte
To serve the I have taken no head
I have myspended my young age
In sin and wantonness also
To serve god slow / and loved to rage
A gloton / a lechour I was both two
I am worthy none other wage
But for to dwell in endless woo
Alas why have I ben outrage
And served the fend that is my foo
But lord in holy write read we
That thou forsakest no wretched wight
That leueth his sin and tourneth to the
And to turn to the have I hight
Full proud and rebel have I been
But now I take me to thy might
From hens for ward to be clean
Against mine own flesh to fight
My flesh to feeble I will fast
My bones to travail and to tene
And through thy grace I am not aghast
What fore and sickness on me be seen
To suffer while my life may last
For utterly I will attend
To punysshe that I have trespast
Mercy I hesu I will amend

Deus. Man I have sent the silver and gold
And all thy wealth within thy wone
To sustain the and thy household
And also other many one
Thou might have helped young and old
That been dyseased and woobe gone
My servants suffered both hungre and cold
Relefe of the yet have they none
If thou give for my love a farthynge
Thou do it with an heavy heart
In alms thou gyuest no thing
For dread thou fall in pouerte
In flesshely lust and worldly liking
What ever thou wastest merry thou art
Of such I will have a reckoning
At domes day thou shalt not astarte
Than shalt thou give a countes full streyte
How thou come by thy good each dele
Whether with troth or with deceyte
And how thou spend it ill or well
None other grace thou after wait
As thou have wrought so shalt thou feel
What shall than profit thy good in plate
Or pounds that thou of the people pele
A clean conscience shall that day
More profit the and more set by
Than all the goods or the monaye
Than ever was under heaven or sky
It will never help to plete nor pray
For as right wise than deem will I
And therefore man whiles thou may
Make amends or that thou dye

Homo. I wot well lord fro year to year
Full gretely grieved I the have
That I would nor thy mercy were
My moders womb had be my grave
For what profyteth my living here
But afterward I should be save
But Ihesu as thou bought me dear
Leave not my soul in hell cave
My waste expense I will withdraw
For waste well called may it be
For it was spended my boost to law
My name to bear on land and se
Well I wot me there not trow
Thought many a man of my country
If they me met they did me not know
Nor never yet herd speak of me
Falsely I have wrought as wretch unwise
I might have gotten me much mede
Had I it spente in gods service
But thorugh thy grace lord I am in dread
As men that lies and may not rise
For have I and mine all our need
With the remenaunt lord at thy deuyse
The poor and naked with cloth and fere
Seek men that lain in gods bands
That have no silver for to spend
And prisoners bound both fete and hands
Often to vysyte and them attend
When Ise them that in need stands
Such as I have I shall them send
Lord let these works less my band
And mercy Ihesu I will amend

Deus. Man if thou amends will make
Give thyn alms of thyn own goods
And sethou works no man to wrake
To venge any other men's modes
If thou untruly from any take
And therewith find forty their fodes
Such sacrefyce I forsake
They be to me as sour as wormewode
The poor people thou do oppress
With sleyghtes and wyles many one
Thou make chyrches and do sing mess
Thou mendest ways where men over goue
And some men curse and some men bless
Which shall I here of these two
If thou will have grace as I guess
Let all falsnes be fled the fro
The mothes that thy clothes ete
And thou let poor men go bare
Thy drink soureth and mouleth thy mete
Wherewith the poor man might well fare
The rust that thy silver does frete
Thy goods that evil gotten are
They cry on the vengeance great
The for to spyll but yet I spare
Withholdest here against the right
From thy servants upon the cry
Man oftentimes thou have me hight
Thou would amend and leave folly
Thou spekest full fair both day and night
Thou brekest my commandments co^tynually
Yet is me loathe with the to fight
But make amends or that thou dye

Homo. Sweet lord I may not against say
I have not holden that I the hight
I grieve the gretely every day
I do not as I had the plyght
I would do well but welawaye
With enemies I am ever beset
When my soul feign would the pay
My flesh is first that will me let
And ever the fatter that I it feed
Ever the fressher it is my foo
Yet bear it about I must need
Full feeble it is it will me sloo
The world /the fend / the flesh they bid
Some with well and some with woo
What may I do with a wicked wede
To fight against three enemies so
When I enforce me otherwhyles
And think I will live a true live
And forsake all batayles and gyles
The world byddeth me battle belyue
And but I will use wrethes and wyles
The common voice is I shall not tryue
Some me scorneth and at me smyles
And count me but a kind caytyue
But now I think withstondynge this
To forsake falsnes withouten end
And restore that I took amys
And pay my dettes fair and hende
And to reward each man his
As reason is than will I spend
And give mine alms there need is
Mercy Ihesu I will amend

Deus. Man I have sent the kyndly sight
And understanding skyll and wit
To rule thy self by reason right
As reherfeth holy writ
That clearly shows the godly light
How thou should deedly sin forsake
And on yt manner thou please me might
What ayleth the thus fro me to shake
Worldly richesse ryall repair
In wealth and things of Iolyte
Fysshes beestes and birds of the air
These thinks me semely for to se
That thing yt perissheth and does appayre
Unto thy sight thus pleasynge be
Well may thou wytre I am full fair
Of whom each thing has this beauty
But man as thou wytlesse were
Thou lokest aye downwarde as a be
It behooves the of me to here
Foul speaking is to the a feast
I comfort the I make the chere
And thou in wardly love me leest
I call the to me year by year
Thou will not come at my request
As fro thy foo thou fro me feles
I follow the fast and on the cry
Thou wrappest the with all vanytees
And think my speech to the but folly
And a thing that naught is you will lose
My Joy that lasts endlesly
Man yet vice leave and virtue chese
And make amends or that thou dye

Homo. Sweet Ihesu none answer I can
But often cry mercy with heart stable
Alas for woo why is a man
Worse than a be unreasonable
All beestes sythen the world began
In kyndely werkynge ben durable
Save only I of will wan
That do full many deeds dampnable
I was made to know my maker
And to love him over all thing
And I a sleper and never waker
To take kind knowing of my king
To tryfles have I ben a great head taker
A song of sorrow may I sing
For had I ben of sin a forsaker
Of christ should I have had some knowing
My ghoostly eyes ben full of duste
Cursed couetyse has blinded me
They ben blodeshotten with flesshely lust
That heavenly king may I not se
But lord though I have been unjust
Thorough help of thy benygnyte
I hope to rub away the ruste
With repentance and grace of the
And where that I have before this
My will in world thing have spend
From hens forward my purpose is
Thy law to learn to my lives end
Thy.x. commandments truly ywys
Them to keep I will me bend
And there as I have done amys
Mercy Ihesu I will amend
