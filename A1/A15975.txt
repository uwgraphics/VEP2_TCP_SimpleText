CONSECRATED to the glory of GOD, DEDICATED to the pious Benefactors and
Patrons of this well intended and laborious work,
SVBMITTED to the censure of them only, who shall have duly examined these
expressions of places most difficult, abstruse, and of most various
interpretation and exposition:

Which if it prove favorable may produce another Edition more exact, complete,
and of a larger letter; if otherwise it may provoke those who are more able to
perform it better.

The Preface.
THe remarkable conformity of many Languages to the French in their Psalmody or
Psalm tunes and verses, has appeared so gracious and divine (in regard no
humane power commanded them thereunto) that it has affected many of our Nation
with wonder and emulation; Insomuch that some Personages of eminent quality and
fame, have not only desired, but also endeavored that those so celebrated tunes
might be sung with English words, and that English people in French or Dutch
Cities or Families might sing English Psalms in those tunes which they use
among whom they live. To this and other purposes all the Psalms of David are
composed with all care and diligence, principally to express the genuine sen^^
of the original Hebrew text, as near as might be attained unto, by the help of
the best Expositers, without respect to any controversy which has bin, or is
now in agitation. As also that the matter be alike disposed of in every
couplet, staue or line agreeable to the French. In every verse (which are of as
many kinds, almost, as the tunes) is observed the same accent in the
beginning, continuance, and end of the line. Note that some long lines should
be set in two, and accordingly accented in reading them. The resonancies are as
many, so disposed; and so many of the same kind, as in the French, by which
rimes (and in some Psalms by Alphabeticall letters) the lines and staves are
knit together for better help of memory. The several kinds of tunes being in
number about 124, and formerly expressed in 6 systems or cliffs, are now
reduced into 2 for more facility in learning them, and are placed, for the most
part, where the Psalm is most in sight. Other observations for breuity are
omitted. To conclude, it is wished that not any Christian would spend their
leisure worse then in singing these or such like Psalms, until we all together
in heaven sing praise to the Eternal, to whom be all honor, thanksgiving and
glory for ever. Amen.

Psalm j Doctrine.
^

WHo walks not in counsel lewd astray,
Who stands not in sinners wicked way,
Who sits not in scorners chair deriding:

With true delight thereon does meditate,
That man is sure to live in blessed state.

Fair planted near the river clear that flovvs,
Which vvholsom fruit abundant timely bears,
Whose leaf still green, norfals nor fails nor seareth:
So that this man, and all he takes in hand.
Shall prosper well, in happy stare (...) ^^and.

They shall be like the chaff before the vvinde,
And as the dust, driven to and fro, contemned.

In judgment just; nor shall the wicked train
Appear in place where righteous men remain.

Their upright, way does know, and well approve:
And he on them eternal life bestows:
But those that be unjust he overthrows.
For every way that wicked men do take,
Shall perish quite, and them accursed make.
Psalm 2. Prophecy.
WIth brutish rage why do the heathen rise,
Tumultuously assembling combinations?
What is the cause rude people enterprise,
To execute their vain imaginations?
^


together all their armed forces bring,
They counsel take, rebelliously conspiring
Against the Lord and his anointed king.

Come let us break their servile cords in sunder,
Come let us cast their slavish yoke away
VVhervvith they think to keep us strictly under.

Shall laugh at them, and their audacious pride,
The Lord of hosts shall scorn their vain endeuer
And evermore them and their deeds deride.

His dreadful voice on them, and in displeasure
And fury fierce with terror of his frovvn
He will perplex, and vex them out of measure.

For I my king anointed have to reign
On Sion hill my holy mount for ever,
His throne thereon I have set to remain.
Pause*
Seeing the Lord has this to me expressed
Thou art my son, this day begot I thee,
Now to appear my heir eternal blessed.

With Nations all for thine inheritage,
The ends of all the earth I will allow thee,
Thou shall possess them all from age to age.

As pleases thee, thou shall control and check them,
And with the same, when, where, and how thou list
Thou shall them bruise, like potters vessels break the^.

Ye Potentates bevvise and understand,
Ye Magistrates in ruling exercised,
Be learned now ye Judges of the land.

Fear ye his wrath, forbear ye to displease him:
Joy in his love, rejoice ye in his law,
And as ye ought, endeuer ye to please him.

His sacred love, lest moving him to wrath,
Ye miss the way, and perish in perdition,
To ruin run in blind erroneous path.
For if his ire like fire begin to flame,
And kindled once but little be extended:
O blessed are all that in his sacred Name
Have put their trust, and on his grace depended.
Psalm 3. Doctrine.
O Lord what numbers rise
Of spiteful enemies,
Even ready to assail me,
What multitudes, what svvarmes,
Are ready up in arms,
To overcome and quall me.

Of them that tell my soul,
It cannot be relieved,
It must be vndertrod,
No help comes from his God,
But they are all deceived.

My buckler in the field,
My succor and my safety,
My glory, my renovvn,
Thou have vpheld my crown,
And born my head so lofty.

Unto my God my guide,
^

Whom I alone rely on:
And he as alvvay near
Vouchsaft my voice to hear
Out of his sacred Sion.

I will ly down, and rest,
And take my timely sleeping:
And without fear likewise,
Awake again, and rise,
For God has me in keeping.
, strong and stout
Besiege me round about,
It nothing should affray me:
Their numbers and their force
Of charrets and of horse,
Should not a whit dismay me.

And save me with thy rod,
For thou have deeply vvounded
The cheeks of all my foes
That up against me rose,
Their very teeth are pounded.

And thy supernall throne,
Is ay to be expected,
All aid and all defense,
Which thou do free dispense
To all thy own elected.
Psalm iiij. Prayer.
^

O Lord, my God, my rights defender,
Ah hearken to me when I call,
As thou my liberty did render.

But hear my earnest prayer vvithall.

My glory to disgrace, disguise,
And turn to shame, and scandal fight ye?
How long will ye in sin delight ye,
In lewd designs, and seek for lies?

The Lord himself ahoue the rest,
Him that is godly has selected,
And lovingly to me affected,
Will hear from heaven, what I request.

Strive not against his sacred will:
Consider if as yet ye see not
When busy toild abroad ye be not,
But in your chamber sole and still.

Just sacrifice his proper right,
And broken hearted, humbled truly,
Before his presence vvalking newly,
Trust in the Lord his gracious might.

Who is it that will show us wealth?
But show us Lord I thee desire
Thy face without thy frovvns of ire,
Thy smiling grace, thy saving health.

And make me much more to rejoice
Then all their store in time of plenty,
When they have thousands reapt for twenty,
Of corn, and wine, and other choice.

Will I ly down, and soundly sleep,
For thou O Lord, I rest assured,
Me with thy grace have round immured,
Me in thy kingdom safe vvilt keep.
Psalm v. Prayer.
^

Unto the words of my complaining,
O Lord incline thy gracious ear,
Vouchsafe to understand and hear,
O thou that in the heavens art reigning,
My cause of plaining.

My crying voice, my God, my King,
For only unto thee I bring,
And offer up with all submission,
This my petition.

If it may please thee, thou shall hear:
My voice when morning does appear
Will I to thee address, attending
Thy grace descending.

Who art not pleased with wickedness
Nor vvinkest at ungodliness:
Ill doers have not any dealing
With thee, nor dwelling.

Thy dreadful presence come before:
For thou abhorrest evermore
The wicked all, that still persevere
In bad indeuer.

That make good evil, evil good:
The murderer, the man of blood
Thou vvilt in fine confound in fire,
In thy fierce ire.

Thy mercyes great and many be,
In reverence, and fear to thee,
Tovvard thy sacred house before thee
I will adore thee.

According to thy righteous guise,
From ambush of my enemies,
And in thy way made plain direct me,
Upright erect me.
Pause.
Their heart is double vvickeder,
Their throat an open sepulcher,
Their tongue by smoothing, soothing, gains,
And alvvaies faineth.

Confound them in their own device,
Disperse them for their heinous vice:
For they against thee have rebelled,
And proudly svvelled.

Is fixed on thee, in thee rejoice:
And joy they ay in heart and voice
That have thy Name in admiration
For their salvation.

And them thou couerst with thy grace,
As with a shield in every place:
Thou free from danger them do render,
As their defender.
Psalm vj. Prayer.
^

LOrd in thy furies terror,
Reprove thou not my error,
Though I thee high incense:
Nor in thy dread displeasure,
Correct me to the measure
Of my extreme offense.

On me show thy compassion,
For grief me vveak does make:
Heal me O Lord, recure me,
Release from pain procure me,
For all my bones do ache.

Is also greatly vexed,
In agony and grief:
O Lord my God, why stayest thou,
Alas how long delayst thou?
When vvilt thou send relief?

Of my soul be the sauer,
From danger safe me make,
Though I cannot deserve it,
Yet save my life, preserve it
For thy own mercy sake.

In darkness deep interred,
None do record thy Name:
Amid the fields infernal,
Who shall extol The Eternal,
Or magnify thy Fame?
Pause.
With sighs and groans I languish:
The tedious night out-vveares,
All restles without sleeping:
My bed I bathe with weeping,
My couch does swim with tears.

Which ay does pierce me thorough,
Mine eyes wax dim and old,
My countenance does wither,
It sinks and shrinks together,
To see my foes so bold.

You from my sight I banish,
Who work iniquity.
Because the Lord has daigned,
To hear when I complained,
And vvaild my misery.

The prayer I erected,
But heard it from on high:
He has not only heard me,
But also did regard me,
And ansvverd graciously.

And blush with shame perplexed
Ezceedingly disgraced:
Let them turn backwards vvounded,
With sudden shame confounded,
And utterly defaced.
Psalm 7. Prayer.
IN thee my God, my trust is ever,
Then save me Lord, and me deliver,
From all that me pursue with hate,
And from the cruel Potentate.

He tear my soul, and me devovver:
While succorles I seem to be,
And there is none to rescue me.

If I deserve this imputation,
If I have done him vvrong in ought,
In deed, or word, or but in thought:

Who was at peace with me united:
^

Nay if I have not done him good,
Who without cause has sought my blood.

Till he oretake, and quite subdue me:
Yea, let him cast my life away,
And in the dust my honor lay.

In wrath to work my foes perdition:
And vvatch for me both day and night,
Till I obtain my promised right.

Shall come to thee freely confessing
Thee Lord and King, and Judge supreme:
Then rouse thy self for love of them.

Now judge thou me, my God eternal;
According to my innocence,
Sincere and clear, free from offense.
Pause.
The righteous just confirm, sustain thou,
For God most just the reins does try,
All thoughts, all hearts he does discry.

My shield vvherby I am secured
Who saves by his power and might,
All those that are in heart upright.

To every one that justly lives,
God threatens them that disobey,
To wrath provoked every day.

He vvil not turn, Gods wrath preventing,
Then he his svvord will sharper vvher,
His bovv is bent and ready set.

Prepared are: his shafts employing
Against them, who inflamed with spite,
In persecuting, take delight.

With mischief great which he conceived:
In travel painful he brought forth
A lying issue nothing vvorth.

A bloody cave descending steeply,
To have intrapt my harmles foot,
But he himself is fallen intoo'r.

Upon himself shall be reflected:
His cruelty and fell despite,
On his own head shall surely light.

Of God the Lord, in whom my trust is:
Him will I praise, and magnify
The glorious Name of God most high.
Psalm 8. Thanksgiving.
Eternal God, our Lord incomparable,
How excellent is thy Name, admirable
Ore all the world, thy glory manifold,
Is far above the highest heavens extold.

Thou have confirmd thy mighty power to render.
Thy enemies confounded, and by those
To stop the mouths of thy reuengefull foes.

The heavens, the works of thy high hands creation;
The Sun, the Moon, and all the Stars about,
In their due place so orderly set out:

O what is man, that thou O Lord art pleased
To visit him? or what is all mankind
That thou vouchsaf^st to keep them in thy mind?
Pause. ^


Thy Angels bright, thy ministers of vvonder:
Thou have with wealth, and honor girt him round,
And thou have him with glory richly crovvnd.

Thy handy works which all the world does cover,
And all therein (as to thee seemed meet)
Thou have subdevvd beneath his regal fee^.

Which on the hills, or on the playns imbattell:
The savage beasts, which in the forests breed,
And which in fields, or in the foulds do feed.

Fish in the Seas and rivers multiplying
Through watery paths what passes great, or small,
Thou unto man have them subjected all.

How excellent: and O how admirable
Is thy great Name, with praises most devout
To be extold the spacious world throughout.
Psalm 9. Thanksgiving.
WIth all my heart O Lord most high,
I will extol and magnify
All thy great works incomparable,
Which vvondrous are, and admirable,

With cheerful heart* and cheerful voice:
O thou most high thy Name relating,
I Will sing, and praise it celebrating.

Mine enemies are put to flight.
^

Down shall they fall with fear surrounded,
And at thy presence all confounded.

Thou have vouchsaft to take in hand
My guiltles cause, thy Throne ascending,
As righteous Judge, my cause defending.

The wicked ruind, raced out,
Their fame their name extinct for ever,
Repriued or revived never.
Pause.
Our cities leueld with the soil?
And are their names with them consumed?
Have thou preuaild as was presumed?

Whose kingdom ever shall remain,
His regal throne he has prepared
Where judgment just shall be declared:

The world, and all that worldlings do:
Yea, he with equal doom will duly
All people censure, just and truly.

Of the oppressed, and ouerlaid.
Their refuge, and sure consolation,
Even in the midst of tribulation.

Will put their whose trust in the same:
For who himself to thee betaketh,
Thy mercy Lord never forsakes.
Pause. ^


Who dvvels in Sion, and record
His high exploits, to nations, telling
His great and glorious acts excelling.

Remembering them he it requires:
And never does forget the crying
Of the oppressed, on him relying.

Consider how I am oppressed
By those that hate me thou that ever
From gates of death do me deliver.

Thy praises all past all compare:
Rejoicing with entire affection
In thy salvation and protection.

Are fallen themselves that dug it:
Yea their own feet are fast ensnared,
In hidden nets themselves prepared.

For having such a judgment shovvn:
In that the wicked are surprised
Even in the snare themselves devised.
Pause.
And headlong into hell fall back:
And all the nations God forgetting,
Their minds upon him never setting.

Be everlastingly forgot:
Nor shall the meek in tribulation
For ever lose their expectation.

The proud preuail and have their will*
But unto judgment bring before thee
The Gentiles which do not adore thee.

Strike thou the nations all with fear:
And make them know, O God immortal,
They are but men, but mould, but mortal.
Psalm x. Of prayer, and comfort.
^

WHy do thou Lord withdraw from us thy grace?
Why stand thou from us departed far?
Why hidest thou the favor of thy face
In troublous times of need and grievous care?

To vex the poor, but let them be surprised
In their own plots maliciously devised.

When not to fail he finds his enterprise:
The greedy rich he does commend admire
The covetous, whom God does hate despise:

Disdain to seek for God, whom he neglects;
In all his thoughts the Lord he nere respects.

Far from his thoughts are all thy judgments high
Puffed up with pride, defiance he does send
Unto his foe, puffs at his enemy:
^


My settled state shall be removed never,
I fear none ill, assured, secured for ever.

Is fully fraught with fraud, deceit and ^yes;
His tongue breeds grief, and broods iniquity,
He privily in theeuish corners pryes.

The innocent he kills whom there he catches,
His murdrous eye poor passengers still watches.
Pause.
The Lion lies, that sudden, vnavvares,
He may entrap poor silly simple men:
To catch, and snatch, and snap them in his snares:

That many poor whom he seeks to deuovvr,
May fall into his clavves, strong pavves and power.

God has forgot, unmindful sure is he,
These matters he does not at all regard,
But hides his face, unwilling them to see:

Lift up thy hand, send aid, and consolation,
Forget not thou the poor in tribulation.

Contemning him, so gracious, good, and kind?
And say ins heart thou vvilt not it require,
But thou have seen, this mischief out do find;

Therefore the poor seek thee, to be redressed,
For thou do help the fatherles distressed.

Of wicked men, and of that evil one:
His wickedness search out, bring it to light;
Cease not to seek, till more thou find none;

The Lord does reign forever, king of glory,
The heathen are driven from his territory.

Thou vvilt prepare their heart on thee to rest,
Them with thy spirit establish and inspire,
And cause thine ear to hear their just request,

Their rightful Judge: so that the poor distressed
By earthly man shall be no more oppressed.
Psalm 11. Comfort.
^

IN God, my hope of safety I have placed:
Why say ye then that I must take my flight
To mountains high, for refuge, as birds chased?

And on the string their arrovvs set, lie lurking
To shoot at them that be in heart upright,
Close out of sight their deadly mischief vvorking.

Be all cast down, and quite demolisht lie,
To bring to pas what are the righteous able?

Inthroned sits, and he from thence discryeth
Men's children all, observing with his eye
All their designs, their actions all he tries.

But his soul hates them that use violence,
Abhorting him that vvrongfull dealing loves.

He raineth snares; he fire and brimstone shovvreth
With burning storms of vvind for recompense,
VVherof full cups he for their portion povvreth.

In faithful vvayes who use all diligence
To walk upright, his countenance respects.
Psalm 12. Prayer.
^

SEnd help O Lord, thy speedy succor daigning,
For upright men departed are away:
Among the sons of men are none remaining,
Who speak the truth, the faithful do decay.

To their near friends in all their speech they use;
With flattring lips, deceitful conversation,
And double heart each other do abuse.

Deceitful lips that flatter, off shall cut;
The God of povvr, who arrogance deiecteth,
Their boasting tongs to silence dumb shall put.

We will preuail, for law, our will shall stand:
Our lips are ours, we fear no cross disasters,
Who over us is Lord, or shall command?

The vvastfull spoil of vveak and needy ones;
Now I will rise (says God) and show salvation.
They shall have rest for I will hear their groans:

Is sure more pure then gold, and silver tried
In furnace flames by perfect sublimation,
Seven times in fire refined and purifide.

Thou vvilt both help and keep in safety sure:
Thou vvilt preserve them from this generation,
In safgard they for ever shall endure.

About they walk, here, there, on every side;
Vile men, and vice have mightily abounded,
Since they have bin so highly dignifide.
Psalm 13. Prayer
^

How long Lord vvilt thou me forget?
For evermore? and vvilt thou let
My prayer be remembered never?
Lord vvilt thou hide thy face for ever,
From me with vvoes and foes beset?

Seek counsel in perplexity,
With grief in heart daily consulting?
How long shall my proud foe insulting
Triumph exalted over me?

Thy gracious answer let me hear,
Inlighten with thy rays bright shining,
My eyes to vvatchfull life inclining,
Lest I to sleep in death appear.

Say, I have over him preuaild.
That they who me afflict and trouble,
Their joy and pleasure do not double,
To see me quite cast down and quaild.

My hope is evermore in thee:
My heart shall joy in thy salvation.
I Will sing to God with exultation,
Who bounteously revvarded me.
Psalm 14. Doctrine.
^

THe fool in heart, the holy God denies:
They are corrupt in all their enterprises,
To be abhord in all their exercises:
Good works none do, nor thereunto advise,
All are unwise.

To see if there were any understanding
To worship him, obeying his commanding.
He searched mankind, to see if any one
Sought God alone.

He found they were become abominable
In all their works, corrupt; and detestable:
Not one does good, none follovv God their guide,
All wander vvide.

That having got my people in their power,
They them as bread do greedily deuovver.
They call not on the Lord of power immense,
Through negligence.

They were cast down with horrid consternation,
For God is in the righteous generation:
His grace does save all them that righteousness.
In heart possess.

Ye his designs and counsels have disgraced:
Because his trust in God the Lord is placed:
For refuge he in danger to him flies,
On him relyes.

Salvation send? when back the Lord returns
The grievous thrall, vvherin his people mourns:
In gladness then shall joyful Jacob dvvell,
And Israel.
Psalm 15. Doctrine.
^

WHo is it Lord which shall remain
Within thy sacred tabernacle?
To whom vvilt thou the favor daigne?
Whom shall thy mountain entertain
To ^est in holy habitacle?

Who evermore uprightly walks,
And alvvay works righteously:
Who in his hearts sincerity
Does speak the truth when ere he talks.

Nor yet maliciously backbiteth:
Nor does his neighbor injury:
Whose ear will hear no obloquy,
That with reproach his neighbour-smiteth.

Himself debosht, is scorned ever,
But they are graced who God do fear,
Who does perform what he does swear,
Though to his loss, yet changes never.

Who upright justice exercises:
And sels it not by bribery.
Who does these things moved shall not be,
A blessed estate him eterniseth.
Psalm 16. Thanksgiving and prophecy.
^

Preserve me Lord, be thou my help and aid,
For I do trust in thee my hope reposing.

Thou art my Lord, I am at thy disposing,
Of all the good thy bounty to me lends,
No benefit at all to thee extends.

All my delight in them is still enlarged,

With multitudes of plagues shall be surcharged:
Nor shall my hands once touch their blood oblation,
Nor shall my lips of their name make relation,

Assigned to me, by thee am I sustained.

A pleasant place by thee I have obtained.
A goodly seat to me thy grace assures.
Which unto me and mine for ay endures.
Pause.
^o me advice and counsel deep declared:
My reins, my thoughts, and my affections he
Even in the night to school me has prepared.

^ince he is near hand, I shall not be confounded.

My glory makes my spirits glad relation:
My soul her flesh in hopeful rest down lays,
With confidence expecting thy salvation.

^or let thy Saint corruption see, interred.

^o triumph in a glorious resurrection:
For thou vvilt show, and guide me to the vvayes
Of life, where joys abound in full perfection:
Even in thy paths, me to thy presence bringing,
At thy right hand are pleasures ever springing.
Psalm 17. Prayer.
^

LOrd hear my right, and entertain
My ernest suit for justice crying,
Thy ear unto my prayer applying.
I plead with lips that do not fain.

Let it come forth just Judge from thee.
And in thine eyes which all things see,
Let all the righteous be regarded.

My heart have visited and tried.
^

But nothing in me have discryed,
Resolved my mouth shall not transgres,
What works so ere men have pursevved.

Which has in me wrought this effect,
That I destroyers paths eschevved.

For ever in thy paths approved,
And never let my steps be moved,
That from thy vvayes I never slide.

O Lord when to thee pray I shall
In peril when to thee I call,
Thine ear will hear my just complaining.

Who have their hope in thee reposed,
Lord let thy mercies be disclosed,
To save them from their rising foes.

Keep me as the apple of thine eye,
In shade of thy vvings let me lie
Hid there from danger safe secured.
Pause.
From cruel hands that do oppres me,
From mortal foes, that to distres me,
Besiege me round, be set my way.

Their mouths with speeches proud abound

Their eyes are down on earth reposed.

His prey, runs swift to seize it speedy,
Or Lions vvhelp with hunger greedy,
In secret cave does lurking lie.

Prevent and disappoint him Lord,
From wicked men who are thy svvord,
My soul deliver, and protect thou.

From men of this worlds fading glory,
Which is but vain and transitory,
Who in this life their portion have.
Whose panch thou fill'st with thy hid treasure,
Of sons and daughters full they be,
And leave to their posterity
The rest of their vvealths plenteous measure.
But I shall view thy gracious sight,
In righteousness being justified:
I vvakened, shall be satisfied
With thy most glorious image bright.
Psalm 18. Thanksgiving and prophecy.
^

THee will I love with heart pure affection,
O Lord my strength, and my most sure protection.

My Savior dear, my hope, my confidence.
^


My trust, my shield, my strong fortification.


The pangs of death did round about dismayme,
And torrents strong of wicked men did fray me.

The snares of death my life prevented have.

My ernest prayrs, loud to my GOD I cried,
He heard my voice out of his Temple high,
And my complaint up to his ears did fly.

His wrath the hills and mighty mountains shaked:
All trembling they exceedingly were moved,
For he was wroth, and unto anger moved,

Out of his mouth the flaming fire deuovvred,
His burning ire like lightning forth did fly,
That coals of fire even kindled were thereby.

Beneath his feet dark misty clouds extended.

And on the vvings of swift winds he did fly.
Pause.
And as a tent about him, hong all over.

The hea^s of clouds dispersed away did pass.
Hail mixed with fire, amazed the world with vvonder:

The most high God sent forth his voice, whose ire
Cast lightnings forth, hailstones and coals of fire.

His lightnings he threvv forth, and them dismayed.

That vvhirlvvind like, thy nostrils forth did cast.
The channels void of waters, were espied,
Foundations of the world were bare discryed.

And drevv me out of many waters deep.

From hateful foes too strong for me, who proved

But then the Lord my stay, me succor sent.

Because to me he pleased to be gracious.

And as my hands were clean, did me revvard.

And have not from him as the wicked svverued.

His laws from me I did not put away.

And from my sin my self strictly restrained.

And as my hands were clean in his eye sight.
Pause.
Good to the good, just to the just thou prouest,

But froward men shall thee as froward find.

But vvilt cast down high looks to pride addicted,

And make my night, as day shine clear and bright.

By thee my God I leapt ore wall and tovver.
The way and word of God is perfect tried,
As gold in fire refinde and purifide.

To all that trust in him and his assistance.

Who is a rock* but God that judges right?

Before me strayt and clear my way preparing.

Sets me on high where places safe I find.

Makes my arms break a bovv of steel in sunder.

And thy right hand has firmly me vpheld.
Thy gentleness my errors rectifying,
Has made me great in goodness multiplying.

From vnderme, that my feet did not slide.

I turned not back, till they were dead or dying.

Beneath my feet I made them down to fall.
Pause.
And vnderme have all my foes subdevved.

That I might them destroy that me do hate.

They called to God, but he no answer gave them.

I cast them out as dirt in the street to fall.

Ore Nations thou to rule as head have made me.
A people strange whom I did never know,
Shall unto me submissiue service shovv.

Strangers shall yield me homage-faind obeying.

To vanish from their sorts, fear shall compel.

Exalted be the God of my salvation.

And v^der me the people he subdevvs.

Ore them that make against me insurrection.
Thou have me raisd and safe deliuerd me
From violence of men that cruel be.

I Will praise thy Name with thankful gratulation.

Who to his King has great deliverance sent.
Who mercy has, to David his anointed,
And to his race for evermore appointed.
Psalm 19. Doctrine.
^

THe heavens so framed are,
That they to all declare
GOD'S glory does excel.
The skies and firmament,
Bright, clear, and permanent,
His handy work does tell.

And of the LORD do preach,
His vvondrous povvr relating:
Night unto night does shovv,
That every one may know.
His vvisdome them creating.

But does this understand.
Though it far distant lies:
Yet does it hear the noise,
Acknovvledging the voice,
And language of the skies,
Their line and words extend.
To earths remotest end,
Throughout the world directing.

Built a pauilion,
Bright radiant rays reflecting.

Fresh from his chamber com,
When he abroad appears,
As champion stout of heart,
Does joy to act his part,
To run his race him cheares,

His journey to and fro,
From heau ns remotest ending,
Huge circle runs amain,
Till he returns again
His heat to all extending.
Pause.
Most perfect is, his Word
The soul with life supplies.
His testimonies true,
With vvisdome do indue,
The simple making wise.

The statutes all are right,
The heart with joy relieuing,
The LORDS comands are pure,
Directing safe and sure,
Unto the eyes light giving.

Of him do clean appear,
To perpetuity.
The judgments of the LORD,
With truth and right accord,
All full of equity.

And more then gold desired,
Then much fine gold beloved,
Then honey that does come
From dropping honey comb.
To taste more svveet approved.

The servant vvarnd begins,
To stand upon his guard,
For who with wisdom deep,
Does them observe and keep,
Obtains great revvard.

So many are and rife,
Who can know them revealed?
Cleanse me from crimes vnknovvn.
Lest I be ouerthrovvn
By secret sins concealed,

Thy servant LORD vvith-hold,
Let them rot domineer,
So shall I freedom vvin,
From guilt of greatest sin,
And innocent appear.

Which heart or mouth affords,
Find gracious acceptance,
My strength consists in thee,
Thou have redeemed me,
LORD GOD of my salvation.
Psalm 20. Prayer.
^

WHen thou do pray, the Lord attend thee
In thy necessity.
The Name of Jacobs God defend thee
In thy adversity.

Against thine adversary.
He strengthen thee, thy state sustaining.
From Sions Sanctuary.

Thy offerings when they burn,
In sign of gracious acceptance,
Heau ns fire to ashes turn,

Let him to grant be vvilling,
Thy counsels all which he inspireth,
Effectually fulfilling.

And in GODS Name will we
Our flags display in exultation,
Thy prayrs GOD grant to thee.

From heaven his holy tovver
Does hear his prayr and has appointed
Help by his hand of power.

In horse and charrets trust*
But we inuoke the Name most glorious
Of GOD the LORD most just.

They headlong fell dejected;
But we are raised, animated,
And stand upright erected.

Let him who is our King,
The day we call, an answer send us,
Which may us comfort bring.
Psalm 21. Thanksgiving.
^

THe King O Lord in thy great might,
Does joy with exultation.
Triumphs in thy salvation.
O what exceeding great delight
In him alvvay remains
That thy grace him maintains.

Of all his heart desired,
And his high state required:
Thou nothing to him do deny,
But strayt he is possessed
Of that his lips request.

Thy goodness him presented,
Thy blessings him prevented:
Thou gave to him a royal crown
Of pure fine gold composed,
Upon his head imposed.

Who art God everliving,
And by thy bounteous giving,
He life received perpetually,
Even length of blessed days,
Which shall endure alvvayes.

And with high exaltation,
By means of thy salvation,
Thy bounty has upon him laid
Imperial dignity
And glorious majesty.

Whereof he is possessed,
Have made him ever blessed,
And thou have shevved him thy face,
Thy favor which he had,
Made him exceeding glad.

Upon the Lord relyeth,
With faith on him affyeth,
Through mercy and benignity
Of God most high approved,
He never shall be moved.
Pause.
Shall find out, having found them,
Shall punish and confound them:
Those who with hate against thee stand,
Thy povvr thou vvilt employ,
To find out and destroy.

As in an oven shall burn them,
And into ashes turn them:
The Lord in wrath shall them consume,
And swallow in his ire,
Deuovvring them with fire.

From off the earth out-race them,
And finally deface them:
Thou shall abolish all their seed,
Cut off their memory,
From all posterity.

Mischievous machinations
In their imaginations:
But they their wicked vain device,
Which they do undertake,
Effectual cannot make.

Thee to affront, not daring
Thy shafts on string preparing!
Their backs as Buts make thou thy aim,
As marks their faces lay,
Whereon thy shafts may play.

In thy own strength and glory,
So thy renowned story,
In songs and Psalms we shall record*
We shall the praise recite
Of thy great povvr and might.
Psalm 22. Prayer and prophecy.
MY GOD my GOD, why leau'st thou me distre^^?
O why have thou forsaken me oppressed?
Far from my aid and cries to thee expressed,
Thy self detayning

Thou hear'st me not, to me no answer daigning,
All right I call to thee, no time restraining,
^re^^ no space.
^


Thy Temple is thy only saving grace
Of Israel* and to the faithful race,
The crown of praises.

Trusted in thee, and in thy love that blazes,
Light to the world this from their thraldom, raises
Their liberty.

Thy answers their deliverances be,
They of their trust in thy fidelity,
Were not ashamed.

Am as a worm, the scorn of men defamed.
Reuilde, reproacht, endure the rage untamed
Of peoples spite.
Pause.
Laugh me to scorn, make movves the lip they bite,
And nod the head, insulting at the sight:
My torments eying.

Of which his trust now is the time of trying,
Now let him save him if that his out crying
Approach his ear.

From thence to thee thou did me take, and where
My infancy sucked natures vigor there,
Made me believing.

Even since the time of that my mothers grieuing,
When from the womb thou tookst me, succor giving,
My GOD thou art,
^


When troubles great do dravv so nigh my heart:
For there is none but thou that can impart,
Help that is speeding,

Fierce like youg Bulls of high and mighty feeding,
Like Bulls that had on Basa^^hils their breeding,
I am beset.

Run rampant, roar, and rave their prey to get:
Their gaping mouths they did vvide open set,
Me to have eaten.

And all my bones seem as in sunder beaten
My heart like wax melts with the fires that greaten
Upon my fears.
Pause.
My silent tongue to my mouths roof adheares,
And in the grave, the dead to dust that wears,
Thou have me placed.

The rudest rout that cruel deeds embraced,
Enclose me round, transfixing they defaced
My hands and feet.

That I can tell my bones; yet when I meet
My cruel foes, their eyes my sorrovves greet
With scornful staring

My seamles coat to cut in pieces sparing,
They keep it whole, and try by lots, declaring
Whose it shall be.

Thou art my strength, I only rest on thee,
Therfo^e make haste to let thy servant see
Thy succor speedy

And helpless life, my darling poor and needy:
Let not these dogs so hateful fierce and greedy,
At once deuovvr.

To swallow me and from the horned povvr
Of Unicorns guard me, thou art my tovvr
Of preservation:

Thy sacred Name, and sing of thy salvation,
In midst of all the holy congregation
Which thus I Will raise.

Ye Jacobs seed, extol him in your lays,
And O ye race of Israel, let your vvayes
Show that ye fear him.

Who was brought lovv, afflicted, who drevv near him,
Nor hid his face from him, nor loathed to hear him
When he did cry.

VVingd with thy praise, and in the open ey
Of those that fear thy Name, O Lord, will I,
My vows deliver,

Shall feed his fill, and those that seek the giver
Of this high grace shall praise the Lord* for ever
Your souls live shall.

The coasts of earth when they to mind him call,
And all the tribes of men to thee shall fall
In adoration.

The LORD is crovvnd, and every high gradation
Of royalty is his, and ore each Nation
He bears sway.

All that down to the grave do go their way,
Shall bovv to him, and those that rotting lay,
Past all reviving.

His servants shall become, by his atchieuing,
A people who are counted ever living
Unto the Lord.

To folk whose birth shall aftertimes afford,
And make them know that he whom they adored,
Deserves believing.
Psalm 23. Thanksgiving.
^

THe living LORD, me ever loving feeds,
My Pastor true, my soul now nothing needs,

Of plenteous food by fountains clear reposing,

For his Names sake in right paths my foot treads.

There dreadles I shall be without dismaying:
For LORD with me, my comfort thou remainest,
Thou with thy rod and staff my life sustainest.

Even in the face of foes that hatred bore me.
With precious oil, my head thou have anointed.
My cup well filld, and all things well appointed.

Thou daignst to me such grace while I am living,
That I on thee in thy own house attending,
Shall praise thy Name O LORD, world without ending.
^

THe earth belongs unto the LORD,
With all the store it does afford,
What in the world has situation.

Which on the waters firm does stand,
Established on a sure foundation.

Who shall remain world without end
Within thy sacred mountain placed?

Whose mouth has never svvorn to guile,
Whose soul vain things has not embraced.

Of righteousness shall be possessed,
Even from the GOD of his salvation.

Who seek his face, and him desire,
This is the blessed generation.

Eternal doors yourselues unfold,
The king of glory entertaining.

The Lord most strong and valerous,
The LORD in battle mighty reigning.

Stand up eternal Doors alvvayes,
To entertain the King of glory.

The LORD of Hoasts victorious,
He only is the King of glory.
Psalm xxv. Alphabeticall Prayer.
^

ALl my hearts desire is raised
To thee LORD, I trust in thee,
Let me never be disgraced,
Nor my foes joy over me.

Them from shame, which do attend thee,
But confound, with shame deiect
Them that causelessly offend thee.

In the knowledge of thy way.
Let me safely be conducted,
In thy paths that walk I may.

Of thy truths clear declaration:
For thou art my help O Lord,
And my daily expectation.

Call thy mercy still to mind,
For thy love is large and spacious,
Thou have evermore been kind.

Holy LORD do not remember,
For thy goodness and thy ttuth;
Deal with me in mercy tender*

Just and righteous is the LORD,
Therefore he will give direction
Unto sinners by his word.

Humblemen truly converted.
GOD will teach and safely lead
In his vvayes the lowly hearted.
Pause
Are the paths of God the Lord,
Unto those whose conversation
Is still guided by his word.

For thy Names sake Lord relieve me,
My sin^ great and many be
Show thy mercy and forgive me.

Whoso fears the Lord of might,
That he shall be taught inured
In the way he does delight.

But at rest in mind and spirit,
Likewise his posterity
Shall the plenteous land inherit.

Unto them that him do fear,
Knowledge is to them revealed,
Who in heart his covenant bear.

Alvvayes him my eye beholds,
He my feet draws from the net,
If I slide, he me vpholdeth.

But O Lord show me thy face,
From this great affliction take me,
Show thy mercy and thy grace.

Which augmenting does distres me:
Send deliverance and relief
From all troubles that oppres me.

Lord behold and pity me,
Many are my molestations,
Let my sins all pardoned be.

Mightily are multiplied,
Offering me great injuries,
With fell hate they me enuyed.

From all ill deliver me,
That I do not blush ashamed,
My hope ever is in thee.

For I vvait on thee depending,
LORD from all adversity,
Save thy Israel him defending.
Psalm 26. Prayer.
^

O LORD GOD, judge thou me,
For in integrity,
I vvalked have, and so abide,
In God I trust assured,
Who has me safe secured,
Therefore I shall not fall nor slide.

O LORD me search and try,
Prove thou my reins, my heart, my mind,
Of every cogitation:
Make strict examination,
Take notice how I am inclinde.

Before my eyes thy grace
Does evermore before me bide,
And in thy truths direction,
I walk with circumspection,
Thy verity my steps does guide.

The lewd inconstant crew:
With them I sit not that are vain,
Who use dissimulation
Within their habitation,
I neither enter nor remain.

Th'assemblies congregate,
Of them that work iniquity,
Their courts shall not be hanted,
Nor will I be acquainted
Nor bide with them that wicked be.
Pause.
To thee I will present
Washed clean and clear they shall be found,
And so with sacrifices
And sacred exercises
Thy altar LORD will I surround.

Of my thanksgiving voice,
Thy honor I will celebrate,
Thy works incomparable,
Thy wonders admirable,
To all abroad I will relate.

The place of thy abode,
Of most renowned high account,
And where thy Honor dwells,
The glorious house excels
My love thereto does all surmount.

Take not my life away,
Inuolu'd with sinners vild accursed,
But let my soul be spared,
When fury is prepared
Their blood to shed, who blood do thirst.

Mischievous plots do stand,
Who study falsely to accuse,
Whose right hand detestable,
With bribes abominable,
Is filled, justice to abuse.

Will walk and not depart
From my sincere integrity,
^^ign thou so to esteem me,
Vouchsafe thou to redeem me,
And be thou gracious unto me.

My feet do firmly stand
In plained paths of righteousness,
I in the congregation,
With thankful adoration.
The Lord my God will praise and bles.
Psalm 27. Thanksgiving.
^

THe Lord God is my light and my salvation.
Then who is he that can make me afraid?
The Lord is my life's strong fortification,
What then is he that can make me dismayed*

To eat my flesh, my cruel deadly foes,
My enemies, whose hate did me oppose,
They stumbled then, and fell down fearfully.

Yet shall my heart fear nothing nor distrust,
Though wars arise and foes seek to confound me,
Yet confident in this still I will trust.

And daily this will I seek to obtain,
That all the days of my life which remain,
In Gods house I may my abiding have.
There to behold in sacred contemplation,
The beauty of hjs Temple I desire.
To visit there his holy habitation,
With diligence attending to inquire.

Within his tent when dangers me assault*
In secret of his house: he will exalt
And set me safe upon a rock to bide.
Pause.
Above my foes, about me circling round:
Therefore will I in Gods house animated,
Sing, sacrifice, rejoice, his praise resound.

Grant my request, and to me gracious be:
Have mercy Lord, with favor answer me,
To this my suit vouchsafe thou to reply.

Seek ye my face, encouraged by thy grace,
My heart strait vvays thy just command obaying,
This vovv replied, Lord I will seek thy face.

In wrath from thee thy servant do not chase:
My helper thou have bin in every place,
Forsake me not, my health, my God, my guide.

The Lord will me to his tuition take.

Teach me thy path, it plain before me make.

Let them not work on me their own desires,
False witness rise against me, shameless liars
They be, and breath out vv^ong and cruelties.

My confidence O Lord upon thy word:
To see thy grace and goodness great disclosed,
Even in the land of life by thee O Lord.

With courage bold quit manfully thy part,
The Lord thy God, make strong thy valiant heart,
Wait on the Lord, for he will thee defend.
Psalm xxvlij. Prayer.
^

O LORD, my strong fortification,
To thee I make my supplication,
Be not as deaf or silent to me,
Lest thy long silence quite undo me,
And I my self to them compare,
That in the grave deep buried are.

When I do cry with hands erected,
Toward thy most holy place elected.

With workers of iniquity,
With wicked men destroy not me.
Whose words speak peace, but hearts malicious
Do hide and harbor hate pernicious.

And as their merits are, revvard them*
As they deserve, pay them their hire,
Such wages as their works require.

To know Gods works, and them discern not,
Nor his hands mighty operation
He will them ruin to desolation.
His force to fall shall them constrain,
And never build them up again.

Who heard my voice to him addressed.

My help on him, my shield, depends,
Therefore my hearts joy does abound,
His praise with thanks my song shall sound.

Deliverance to his king anointed.

Be thou the strength of their salvation,
Vouchsafe to bles thine heritance,
Them ever guide, feed and advance.
Psalm 29. Doctrine.
^

ALl ye Princes, mighty States,
Monarchs, Kings, and Potentates,
Render to the Lord his right,
Glory, Majesty, and might.

Render praises answerable:
Worship God perform this duty,
In his house of sacred beauty.

Is the Lords most mighty voice.
God most glorious from his seat,
Thunders ore the waters great.

Ever powerful, never fails.
Gods voice all subdevveth under,
Full of majesty and vvonder.

Strong tall Cedars it does break.
When the Lord his voice extends,
It the Leban Cedars rends.

Like a Calf to skip he makes them.
Leban mounts, and Shiryon danced,
Like young Unicorns they pranced.

Flames of fire it does divide.

Kadesh wilderness it shakes.

That their fruit abortiue dies.
His voice forests flying over,
Suddenly does them discover.
They that in his Temple be,
Speak his praises joyfully:
All that in his house do dvvell,
Of his glorious acts do tell.

On the flood that ebbs and flovveth.
Sitting on his throne supernall,
God the Lord is King eternal.

Will maintain his peoples right.
God his people will increase,
He will bles them all with peace.
Psalm 30. Thanksgiving.
^

I Will exalt thee Lord with praise,
For thou from troubles did me raise,
And have not suffered them that be
My foes, to triumph over me;
Therefore thou shall be magnified
And ever highly glorified.

And thou to health restoredst me.

Thou from the grave my soul have brought.
Thou have kept me alive, revived me,
From going down the pit repriu'd me.

Sing Psalms to him, his praise resound,
His holiness commemorate.

Which in a moment is appeased,
His anger suddenly is ceased.
But who are with his favor graced,
Blessed life enjoy, which ay shall last,
Though evening sorrovves cause ye vveep,
And grief all night, ye restles keep:
Yet when the morning light appears,
Refreshing joy, with comfort cheareth.
Pause.
I said I never moved shall be,

Thou LORD whose favor does endure,
Have, by thy grace to me applied,
My mountain strongly fortified.
When thou did hide from me thy face,
I troubled and afflicted was.

Complaining to my God, I said,

When in the grave I shall ly rotten?
What worthy praise shall dust afford?
Shall ashes glorify thee Lord?
Can rottennes thy truth declare?

On me take thou commiseration,
LORD be my helper, my salvation.

And when in sackcloth I did mourn,
Thou tookst it off, and girtst me round
With pleasures pure, thy praise to sound.

My God I Will give thee thanks for ever.
Psalme^ xxxj. Prayer.
^

IN thee alone O Lord my trust is,
My hope is in thy Name,
Let me not suffer shame:
But me deliver in thy justice,
When trouble me assaileth,
For thy word never fails.

Bovv down thy care to me,
Me soon from dangers free:
Be thou my strong fortification,
From troubles all secure me,
Of thy defense assure me.

Where I may safe abide,
For thy Name sake me guide.

From nets they hide to take me,
Thou art my strength, safe make me.

Thou have redeemed me,
Lord God of verity.

All vanities defying,
I hate them that love lying.

Thy mercy does me fill
With joy, praise thee I will.
Thou have known me in tribulation,
My troubled soul have vievved,
And how it was pursevved:

Within their cruel povvr,
That would my soul deuovvr.
My fee^ from bands thou have unloosed,
And to me being gracious,
Made my room large and spacious.

For in distres am I,
Consumed is mine eye,
And fretted sore with pain and grieuing,
My soul with grief does languish,
My belly pines with anguish.

With grief in sighs and tears
Consumed are my years:
Because of sin, my strength does fail me,
So long affliction lasts,
That all my bones it vvasteth.
Pause.
Have sought me to defame,
Reproaching me with shame:
My neighbors and acquaintance fear me,
They that without did spy me
Far off, away did fly me.

Quite out of mind forgot,
Or as a broken pot:
For many great ones me deterred,
I heard their shameful railing
On all sides, fear assayling.

Against me they conspire,
To kill me they desire:
But my trust is in thy salvation,
I said O LORD eternal,
Thou art my GOD supernall.

From my fierce enemy,
Do thou deliver me:
From my foes hands let me be freed,
From all that do distres me,
And cruelly oppres me.

In favor show thy face,
O save me by thy grace.

LORD let no shame light on me,
For I do call upon thee.
But let the wicked be ashamed,
And in the silent grave,
Their mouths stopped let them have.

Who righteous men reviled,
With slanders foul defiled,

Have thou for them in store,
Which thee in fear adore.
Thou have wrought wonders admirable,
For them to all disclosed,
Who trust in thee reposed.

Thou safely vvilt them hide
From foes outrageous pride.
Thy Tents shall daign them preservation,
Kept safe by thy prevention,
From slandrous tongs contention.

For vvondrous svveet and kind
To me I him do find.
For in a City fortified,
He has kept me immured,
In time of war secured.

I am deprived quite
Of thy al-blessing sight.
But thou did hear my supplication,
When unto thee I cried,
My suit was not denied.

For he the faithful gards,
The proud with scorn rewards.

Their hearts GOD fortifyeth,
Whose trust in him relyeth.
Psalm xxxij. Prophecy,
^

IN blessed state he evermore remains,
Who of his sins, forgiveness free obtains.
Whose trespasses shall never be revealed,
And whose offense shall ever be concealed.

To whom his sins the LORD has not imputed*
Within whose soul does dvvell integrity,
Free from all fraud, guile, and hypocrisy.

My heinous sins concealed, not confessing,
My flesh and bones consumed, as with age,
And all day long roaring with torments rage

Thy heavy plagues incessant me oppressed.
So waste was my native moisture spent,
It did the drought of summer represent.

And freely my transgressions I expressed.
LORD I will show (said I) my faults to thee,
And thou forgau'st my sins iniquity.

By prayr shall seek thy face in time of finding,
The waves of vvoe to him shall not come near,
Afflictions stouds he needs not to fear.
Pause.
From trouble thou shall keep me safe abiding,
For giving me deliverance by thy grace,
With songs of joy thou vvilt me round embrace.

And in the way that thou shall go, conduct thee:
Thee to direct, my counsel thou shall try,
And I will guide thee alvvay with mine eye.

Like horse and mule, whom without bit commanding*
Thou can not rule, whose mouth must be restrained,
With bit or spur, to stay or go constrained.

With sorrovves great they shall be all perplexed:
But in the LORD, who all his trust does place,
Compassion shall him compass and embrace.

Rejoice in GOD, who is your comforts treasure:
All ye that are in faithful heart upright,
Shout ye aloud for joy with true delight.
Psalm 33. Doctrine.
^

WIth joyful shouts, peals gladly ringing,
Ye righteous in the LORD rejoice:
It well becoms you his praise singing.
Praise ye the LORD with Harp and voice:
Making music meetest,
Consorts sounding sweetest
On the Psalterie,
With ten strings resounding,
Sing Psalms to him sounding,
Praise his Name with glee.

In new songs show his praise, your joys,
Play skilfully with sounds harmonious,
Triumphantly with lovvdest noise.

Is most just and rightful:
His works ^^thfull bide,
All things he composeth,
Faithfully disposes,
Them in truth does guide.

And Judgment just does please his will,
The earth his bounteous mercy proves,
The Lords great goodness does it fill.

On high situated:
When the word he said,
His mouth on them breathed,
He their form bequeathed,
All their Host he made.
Pause.
Within the Sea by povvr divine,
The deeps he keeps all flowing thither,
Stored up within his magazine.

And high reverence bear him,
Who is GOD the LORD,
In the world all dwelling,
Fear his povvr excelling,
Tremble at his word.

It was performed readily,
And what his sacred word had willed,
It stood remaining steadily.

Counsels and devises,
GOD does dissipate
Peoples consultations
Wicked machinations
He does nihilate.

Shall stand for ever firm and sure,
His counsels through all generations
^

And thoughts of his heart ay endure.

People, Congregation,
Whose GOD is the LORD:
Whom he does inherit,
Chosen by his spirit,
Purchased by his Word.
Pause.
And looks dovvnvvard from the sky,
He all the sons of men beholds,
And on them sets his vvatchfull ey*

In high contemplation,
He beholds well,
His eye does discover
All the earth quite over,
Them who there do dvvell.

Conforming all their hearts alone,
He understands well, and knovveth
Their works considering every one.

Though like Bees they svvarmed,
Cannot save a King:
Strength of man can never
Him save or deliver
From deaths killing sting.

Himself to save by strength of horse,
Though he in courage fierce surmounteth,
He none shall save by his great force.

Them, with grace rendevveth
Who with fear him serve,
Who in him affyeth,
On his grace relyeth,
He will them preserve.
Pause.
Death shall not them of life deprive,
With plenteous food them all supplying,
In famine them to keep alive.

To him we applying,
Our souls him attend,
His aid and his fauer
Is our shield and sauer,
He does us defend.

In him we joy who is most just:
For in his Name which is most holy,
We settled have our hope and trust.

Let thy mercy spacious
Ever on us be:
Let thy might maintain us,
And thy grace sustain us
As we trust in thee.
Psalm 34. Alphabeticall. Doctrine.
AT all times I will bles
The Lord my God, his worthy praise,
His glory and renovvn alvvayes,

Boast in thy gloriou^ Sauer dear:
The faithful meek, thereof shall hear,
And shall with me rejoice.

Him magnify, extol his Name:
Let us him praise, and raise his fame,
Together all jointly.

Who graciously my suit did hear,
And freed me soon from all my fear,
My full deliverance wrought.

And look for favor, gaind his grace,
Shame did not make them hide their face,
Nor did it them deiect.

For help at need, the Lord did hear,
And freed him from distres and fear,
Saved him from troubles all.
Pause.
About them that in fear him serve:
From all distres them to preserve,
All dangers to prevent.

How good is he, O taste and see,
He blessed shall for ever be,
Who trusts in his word.

Fear ye the Lord, but fear no want,
For nothing is or shall be scant
To them that him do fear.

But they that seek God shall not want,
Nor any good to them be scant,
Who on the Lord rely.

My children dear come near and learn
True wisdom to know and discern
The Lord your God to fear.

Who loves many days to see,
Of comfort and prosperity,
True riches to acquire

Must guard his lips from subtle bayt,
Of fraudulent and false deceit,
From speaking any guile,

Do good, seek peace, and it pursevv.

His ear does hear their call.
Pause.
His face against ill doers all,
To cut off their memorial
From earth with his own svvord,

The Lord does hear when they complain,
And saves them from all their pain,
And all their misery.

Does find the Lord is near to save
All them that contrite spirits have,
And to him soon convert.

Afflictions many do endure,
But GOD in whom their trust is sure,
Does free them by his might.

Both whole and sound all his bones be,
So careful of them all is he,
That broke there is not one.

By evil means, and desolate
They shall be who the righteous hate,
They guilty shall remain.

His servants soul redeemes, and them
As guilty he will not condem,
Whose trust is in his Word.
Psalm 35. Prayer.
^

AGainst my foes Lord plead my right,
And smite thou them who me do smite,
With shield and spear completely aimed,
Stand for my aid, save me unharmed:
Charge on them, march before my face,
Block up their way who me do chase:

That can and will deliver thee.

Them backwards drive, and quite confound,
Them that do seek my souls surprising,
To mischief me my harm devising,

As with the chafe the vvinde does play,
And let Gods Angel drive and chase
Them all abroad from place to place.

That groping stumbling, fall they may:
And let Gods Angel fiercely chase them,
Them persecuting quite out-race them.

Pernicious nets of cruelty:
And causelessly they digd a pit,
That they might take my soul in it.

Let him be caught in his own snares
In nets which he for me intended,
Let his own feet be apprehended:
In that destruction let him slide,
Which he for me did secret hide.

In God that has preserved me.
Pause,
O LORD who may compare with thee,
Who sau'st the vveak by thy assistance
From foes too strong for his resistance.
Yea the afflicted indigent,
From spoylers outrage violent.

They charge me with what I nere knevv.

Seeking to take my life away.

I sackcloth wore, did fast and languish:
My prayr for them when I did mourn,
Into my bosom did return.

As to my brother or dear friend.
Bovv'd down with grief I fared as one,
His mother dead does wall and moan;

And to deride me, they consorted:
Against me, abiects base did plot
Together, and I knevv it not:
Reuiling me with open throat
They did me tear, and ceased not.

And bitter scoffing Parasites
Did mock and iear with scurrill ieasting,
To make guests merry at their feasting.

Daign thou to save my only one:
My soul from their destructions free,
From Lions jaws deliver me.
Pause.
Will praise thy Name O GOD most high:
In the most frequent congregation,
Iof thy praise will make relation,
Let not my vvrongfull enemy
Rejoice and triumph over me:
Nor let their eye with causeles hate,
VVinke on my poor deplored estate.

But to devise they do not cease,
Deceitful plots abominable,
To trouble them that are peaceable.

Their mouths, that they might me deride:
And every one cries out on me,
Aha the wretch our eye does see.

In silence do not let it pas:
LORD be not far, norme forsake thou,

To judge my cause: my God art thou,

According to thy equity,
That they rejoice not over me.

Ha ha, so so, be glad we may:
We have deuovvrd him, quite destroyed.

Confounded and disgraced be.
Who magnified themselves ore me,
Let them all over be arayd
With shame, dishonord and dismayed.

Who me in my just cause sustain.
For ever let them sing resounding,
Blessed be the mighty povvr abounding,
Of thee O Lord whom it does please
To give unto thy servants peace.

All day thy praise I Will celebrate.
Psalm 36. Doctrine.
THe wicked man has so transgrest,
That in my heart it is manifest
He has Gods fear rejected,
For so long himself flattereth he
^


Found hateful when detected.
His words unjust are fraud and lies,

No good he exercises,

In vvayes not good to walk, he s bent,
No evil he despises.

Fills heaven, and thy fidelity
To reach the clouds thou daignest.

Thy judgments deepest depth we count,
Thou man and beast sustainest.

Therefore men put their trust in thee,
To thy vvings shade betake them.

Full satisfy, to drink the strem
Of thy joys thou shall make them.

And in thy light, we light shall see,
Which never shall have ending.

Who know thee, to the upright heart,
Thy righteousness extending.

Nor wicked hand make me to flee,
Nor captive me surprising.

And irrecouerably cast down,
Disabled quite from rising,
Psalm xxxvij. Alphabeticall. Doctrine.
^

AT wicked men to envy be not moved,
Frit not at them who work iniquity,
Nor grieve that their designs have prosperous proved

Like grass movv'd down, they perish shall for ever,
And as green herbs shall wither finally.

So shall thou in the land thy dwelling have
There shall he feed thee, faithful, failing never.

Rejoice in him, thy comsorts multiplying,
Who will give thee all good thy heart does crave.

Trust thou on him, who for thee by his might,
Shall it perform with thy designs complying.

As at noon day thy righteousness reflecting,
Resplendent rays shall make it shine most bright.

Rest in the LORD, and fret not discontent
At him who thriues in's way, lewd plots effecting.

And be not thou to actions ill addressed,
Nor vex thy self to do a bad intent.

But they that on the LORD vvayt constantly,
Shall of the land be ever sure possessed.

Extinguished quite; mark with due observation
His dwelling place no where is found to be.

Meek minded men inherit shall the land,
In plenteous peace enjoy true delectation.

To overthrow the just, upright abiding,
And with his teeth does gnashing at him stand.

His counsels vain, foresees his dismal day,
When he shall fall down into ruin sliding.

The humble poor, to bring the needy under,
Quite to confound the upright in their way.

For their own svvords shall their own hearts destroy,
And their strong bovves shall be all broke in sunder.

More precious is, then what the wicked gains,
Though treasures great which turn to their anoy.

Which shall be broke, but by his povvr and might
The Eternal Lord, the righteous man sustaineth.

And those that be of perfect conversation,
With heritage eternal will requite.

They shall remain, from foul reproaches free,
In famine they shall have full sustentation.

Gods foes shall be as fat of Lambs decaying,
And into smoke they shall consumed be.
Pause.
The righteous man his mercy does expres,
And freely gives his bounty not delaying.

Whom God does bles with his grace favorable,
Whom he does curse shall perish in distres.

And in his way does his delight remain,
Which unto him is alvvay acceptable,

Yet shall he not be utterly dejected,
Because the Lord his hand will sure sustain.

Have I ere seen to be forsaken quite,
Nor yet his seed to beg their bread rejected.

To them that need, he freely gives and lends,
A blessed state his seed enioyes by right.

Do well, and dvvell to perpetuity,
In place where grace to thee and thine God sends.

Nor leaves his Saints, they ay have preservation,
But will cut off seed of iniquity.
Pause.
Shall have, in the land of his inheritance,
From every age to every generation.

Of his discourse, his wisdom grave discloseth,
In all his speech he justice does advance.

Gods sacred Law, his steps shall never slide,
For it his guide, he in his way proposes.

To vvatch the just, his life seeks to bereave him,
When first he shall advantage fit have spide.

Nor him condemn upon his judgment day.
But to his grace, as innocent receive him.

Who will exalt thee in thine own land blessed,
The wicked thou shall see cut quite away.

Fair flourishing a while, like Laurel green,
Spreading abroad all gallantly addressed.

I sought for him, but seeking could not find him,
His dwelling place could not be found nor seen.

For righteousness the upright shall defend,
And blessed peace be in the end assigned him.

They finally shall suffer extirpation,
And utterly be cut off in the end.

Of righteous men: for he will ever be
Their hope and strength in time of tribulation.

From wicked men they shall have preservation,
Because they trust in him, them save will he.
Psalm xxxviij. Prayer.
^

LOrd my God, in thy displeasure,
To the measure
Of my sins, rebuke not me:
Neither in thy furies terrors,
For my errors,
Let me not chastised be.

Piercing deep, in me stick fast,
Heavily thy hand does pres me, and distres me,
Prostrate down it does me cast.

That in me no flesh is sound:
My offenses have perplexed me, and so vexed me,
That my bones no rest have found.

They so great and high appear:
Burden so intolerable, that unable
^s my weakness them to bear.

Stinking, putrify, and run:
Since I rashly enterprised unadvised,
What I foolishly have done.
Pause.
Dovvnvvard bovvd I crooked grow:
Sorrovves cease not me tormenting, that lamenting
All day long I mourning go.

Sore diseased, full of pain:
In my flesh with inflammations, sharp vexations,
Now no soundnes does remain.

I am bruised very sore:
Torment which my heart sustaineth, me so paineth,
That for grief I groan and rore.

Is my whole desire made known.
Thou do hear my sighs and groaning, and my moning
Is not unto thee vnshovvn.

Wonted strength from me is gone.
These my eyes to light inured, now obscured,
Darkened are, sight have I none.

From my grief departed are.
My acquaintance late incroaching now reproaching,
From me neighbors stand off far.
Pause.
Others seeking me to grieve.
Me with speeches vil^e abusing, still are musing,
How with craft me to deceive.

As if I were deaf become,
Not a word I then did utter, nor once mutter,
Shut my mouth as mute and domb.

As one deaf that naught perceived,
Their false slanders not reproving nor disprouing,
As I vvereof speech bereaved.

On thee Lord do I attend.
Thou O Lord my God eternal, high, supernall,
Wilt me hear and answer send.

Lest they triumph over me.
If my feet once fall to sliding by misguiding,
They joy at my misery.
Pause.
Down to halt in feeble plight
For my fault I grieve and sorrovv eve and morrow,
Evermore before my sight.

I will open and declare.
Sins unfeignedly repenting and lamenting
They so great and grievous are.

Merry make, strong fortifide.
They that wrongfully do hate me, grind and grate me,
Mightily are multiplide.

A^e my foes, and seek my blood:
Therefore they so rate and blame me, seek to shame me,
Cause I do what is just and good.

Of thy favor to me dear.
Far off from me be thou never, but for ever
O my God to me be near.

Speedy aid to me impart:
Thou art God of consolation, my salvation,
And my Sauer Lord thou art.
Psalm 39. Consolation.
^

I Said I will to all my vvayes take heed,
That I sin not in word or deed:
My tongue from speech I strictly will restrain,
While wicked men with me remain:
And lest my mouth my meaning do unfold,
As with a bridle I le vvith-hold.

Refraind to speak even what was good.

And more heat did my heart torment.
My zealous thoughts on fire the flame forth brake,
And with my tongue these words I spoke.

And to what length my days extend:
Vntome shovv my frail and vveak estate,
Behold, my days abreuiate.

My age is nothing unto thee.
Man verily is but mere vanity,
When in best state he seems to be. Selah.

Themselves in vain they do molest,
To heap up wealth, his mind he does employ,
Not knovving who shall it inloy.
Pause
I hope for thee, on thee alone.

And let me not reproched be.
By fools, nor them permit, who are unwise,
With scorns, and scoffs me to despise.

Nor open my mouth, as I were domb,
Because that all this has been done by thee.

Thy hand such strokes confounding on me lay,
That fainting I consume away.

Man to correct and scourge for sin.
His beauty thou consumest, as the moth
The garment frets and eats the cloth:
For every man doubtless, what ere he be,
Is nothing else but vanity.

Hold not thy peace at these my tears,
For I with thee as all my fathers were,
A stranger am, a soiorner.

Ere I go hence, and be no more.
Psalm 40. Thanksgiving.
WHile I did long with patient constancy,
The pleasure of my GOD attend,
He unto me his ear did bend,
And to my cries he hearkened graciously.

From dungeon he retired,
Where I in horror lay:
And set my feet upon
A steadfast rocky stone,
And my vveak steps did stay.

That to our GOD I might sing praise,
^

Which many hearing hearts shall raise,
To fear with trust, and trust with fear the Lord,

Whose trust is so addressed,
And on the LORD relyes,
Who gives no respect^
To them that pride affect,
And turn aside to lies.

And vvonderfull which thou have done,
Thy thoughts when us thou think on,
In order due to thee cannot be told.
Their number so surmounting,
Far passes our accounting.

Accepted in thine eyes,
Then would I sacrifice,
But thou did open mine ear.

For sin. Then said I lo behold
Me ready here I am, enrould
Within thy book my written name does stand.

To do with heart unfeigned,
My GOD is my delight.
Within the middle part,
And center of my heart,
I bear thy law upright.
Pause.
Where multitudes assembled were,
O Lord thou knovvst how, when and where,
That I thy truth refrained not to teach.

Thy mighty aid revealing,
To all I do declare,
I shovv thy bounty great,
Thy mercies I repeat,
Where great assemblies are:

From me O Lord, but with thy grace
And loving kindness me embrace,
And let the truth preserve me safe alvvay,

My sins do so confound me,
That up I cannot look,
They more in number are,
Then on my head is hair,
My heart ^^^h me forsook.


Who my destruction seek to frame.
Who vvish me ill, drive back with shame disgraced,
And let them be destroyed,
Who at my vvoes have ioyed:
All desolate them lay,
Their shame with shame repay,
Who in derision say
To me, aha, aha.

To seek the beauty of thy face:
Let them that love thy saving grace,
Say evermore, exalt the Lord with praise.

Yet God me minds, helps speedy.
Thou art my aid alvvay,
Thou only, thou art he
That do deliver me:
My God make no delay.
Psalm 41. Prayer and prophecy.
HE blessed is that does compassion shovv
To them that are brought lovv:
He from the Lord of comfort shall not mi^,
When he afflicted is.
^


On earth shall blessed be.
He will not him deliver, no^ expose
Unto his furious foes.

God will his strength restore:
And turn his couch from all disease and pain,
To health and ease again.

Have mercy LORD on me,
O heal my soul, let it recured be,
For I offended thee.

While thus of me they say,
When, when will death o^e take this vvretched vvight,
And his name perish quite.

They inward hate disguise*
They wicked thoughts up heap, which strayt they shovv
As soon as forth they go.
Pause.
Against me whispering be:
Against me they conspire, and enterprise,
To hurt me they devise.

It fast to him does cleave:
Dejected lovv cast down, there now he lies,
That never more shall rise.

The secret of my heart:
Who ate my bread, and did my bounty feel,
Against me lift his heel.

On me let mercy fall.
And raise me up, that I may have the might,
Their merits to requite.

That I to thee am dear:
Because thou do not make mine enemy
To triumph over me.

In my most rightful way.
Whom thou of thy good grace do firmly place,
For ay before thy face.

His praises ever tell:
From age to age, world without end. Amen.
Amen I say again.
Psalm 42. Consolation.
^

AS the chased Heart pants braying,
Seeking some refreshing brook:
So my thirsty soul longs praying,
Zealous on my GOD to look.

Everliving GOD for thee:
LORD when shall I come before thee,
In thy presence to adore thee.

Bri^ish tears are all my food:
While they question me disdaining,
Where is now thy God so good.

How I marching late had gone,
Leading troops Gods praises singing,
To his Temple offerings bringing.

So disquiet, so disma'yd,
Wait on God, for still his glory
In my song shall be displayed.
When but with one look of his,
He shall me restore to bliss.

See my soul it self deiecteth.
For my mind on my God thinks,
Even from Hermon mountain high:
From the land that Jordan drinks,
And where Missar hillocks lie.

Other depths of vvoes does call:
While my GOD with dreadful wonders,
On me wretch his Tempests thunders.
Pause. All thy floods ore me abounded,
All thy billovves ore me went:
Yet on this my hope is grounded,
That thine anger being spent

Singing shall the night be past:
Praying praising, and thanksgiving,
To my God while I am living.

Why am I forgot by thee?
Why should grief my heart deuovver.
While the Foe oppresses me?

Wound and pierce me to the bones,
Whilst my foes ask me deriding*
Where has now your God his biding?

So dejected, so dismayed?
Wait on God, for still his glory
In my songs shall be displayed.
To him shall my thanks be paid,
Who is still my present aid,
Whose salvation me has raised,
Is my God for ever praised.
^

LOrd judge me, make examination,
Plead thou my cause, and set me free
From this unjust and cruel Nation,
Deceitful in their conversation.
From them that deal injuriously,
Save and deliver me.

From thee why do thou me exclude?
Why go I mourning every hour?
My foes who would my soul deuovver,
Oppres me with their multitude,
By them I am pursevvd.

And let thy faithful truth divine,
Conduct and save me from destruction,
And let them be my introduction
Into that sacred hill of thine,
Me to thy house assign.

Unto the Altar cheerfully,
Of God who is my comforts treasure.
In whom my joy exceeds measure.
Upon the Harp I will praise thee,
Thou LORD art GOD to me*

And so disquieted in me?
Wait thou on God, with hope erected,
With patience let him be expected.
For he by me shall praised be,
My health, my God is he.
Psalm 44. Prayer.
LORD GOD of high renovvn and glory,
Our ears have heard the joyous story
Which our forefathers have us told:
^

Of vvondrous works thou did of old,
How thou the heathen did expel,
And in that land our fathers planted
By thy strong hand therein to dvvell,
Their foes were plagued and supplanted.

By their own svvord to war addressed:
Nor could the might of their own arm
In doubtful fight, save them from harm.
But it was that right hand of thine,
And thy strong arm that was their Sauer,
On them thy face with light did shine,
Because thou did thy people fauer.

To Jacob, to thy servant loyal:
Help and salvation timely send,
And him as thou were wont defend.

We shall push down them that distres us,
And in thy Name we shall down tread,
All them that rise up to suppres us.

Nor shall at all my svvord assure me,
In them no confidence I have,
Nor hope that me my arms shall save.

Which sauest us from our distressers:
And thou have put to shame each one,
Who were our haters and oppressers.
Pause.
And we record the sacred story
Of his all-blessed Name most high,
Which evermore we magnify.
^


Thou do us shame, and quite reject us:
Thou with our armies do not go,
Forth do not lead us, nor protect us.

From enemies that captive take us:
Our hateful foes give us the foil,
And what they please, they take and spoil.

As sheep for slaughter be ordained:
Thou have dispersed us that to ly
Among nations strange we are constrained.

For naught the^ selling, thou despisest:
Thou letst them go at rates so cheap,
For them no profit thou do reap.

Thou makst us be, they mock and flout us,
They scorn and scoff us, they deride
That are our neighbors round about us.

Their by word, common talk, and babble:
When us the wicked people see.
They nod their heads in mockery.

Is in my sight, spreds me all over:
And my reproachful infamy.
With shame my blushing face does cover.

And at our ebb so flowing streameth:
For that the foe in rage and ire,
To be revenged is set on fire.

Though this befall us notvvithstanding,
Nor have we dealt deceitfully
Against thy covenant and commanding.
Pause.
Yet are not from thy service turned:
Our steps from thee go not astray,
Nor do we wander from thy way.

Where monstrous Dragons have their biding:
And have us couerd with disgrace,
With deaths shade us in darkness hiding.

Of our good gracious God supernall:
If we have lifted up our hands
To other gods of godles lands.

Who all thoughts, words and works unfolds,
All secrets knovvs with piercing eye,
All hearts most inward parts beholds.

For thee we all day long are killed:
And we are counted but as sheep,
Which they for present slaughter keep.

Arise, and let thy power erect us:
For ever do not us forsake,
Be not far off, nor quite reject us:

From us, still absent thou abidest,
Unmindful yet do thou remain,
Forgetting our distres and pain.

Our vital spirits, grief bereaueth:
We on the ground ly prostrate now,
And to the earth our belly cleaves.

Deliver us from tribulation:
And for thy mercy sake us free,
Redeem us from adversity.
Psalm xlv. Doctrine.
^

A High design my fervent heart inflameth,
Of King divine heroycall song i^ frames.
Invention quick to fluent tongue indites,
Which faster flovves then svviftest penman writes.
Thy beauty rare the fons of men exceeds,
Past all compare grace from thy lips proceeds:
Therefore thy God has thee forever blessed,
And thou of bliss eternal art possessed.

Upon thy thigh gird thou thy svvord victorious.

Prosper, preuail in word of truth and right.
Thy mercy mild, with rigorous justice bideth,
Thy gracious heart* thy vigorous arm still guides.
But those thy foes whose hearts no love can vvin,
Thy hand to fright with terrors shall begin*

And thy foes hearts shall pierce and strike in sunder:
To thee O King, the Nations all shall bend,
Thy mighty arm, thy rule shall far extend.

Thy Scepter right through all thy Realm procures.

But hate vvrong, deceit, and wickedness,
Wherefore thy God has thee his Christ appointed,
And thee with oil of gladness has anointed:
Much more and far above thy fellows all,
Whom to partake with thee, thy love does call.

Thy robes perfumde are unto thee presented,
From palaces of precious iuorie,
Whereby they have exhilarated thee.
Pause. Then Ladies fair present attendant duty,
Kings daughters rare, prime paragons of beauty,
Boue all, the Queen, thy joyous lovely Bride,
In Ophir gold does stand at thy right side.

Consider well, thine ears to my words bend thou,
Thy fathers house forget, thy peoples guise,
And native rites thou also shall despise.

In thy pure love, and in thy beauties treasure,
Him honor thou thy Lord with pleasing grace,
Bovv fair to him, his love entire embrace.

Great Princes shall to thee bring rich oblations.

With robes of gold embroidred gorgeously.

Be brought in robes of Phrygian work attired.
And Virgin troops her loved associates dear,
Attending, shall in thy blessed sight appear.

Triumphant joy, and glad congratulations,
She shall be brought, with all her Princely train,
The Palace royal shall them entertain.

With royal Sons thy of spring multiplied:
Whom Princes in all lands thou shall ordain,
Whose Scepters right and justice shall maintain.

From age to age, record the eternal story:
The people all thy honor high shall raise,
And celebrate perpetually thy praise.
Psalm 46, Victory.
WHen ^s adversity offends,
God is our refuge, us defends.
In all distres, and time of need,
His help we find with present speed.

Though moved be the earths foundation,
^

Although the mountains high and steep,
Were thrown in the middle of the deep.

Roar, troubled tossed with violent motion:
And though provvd swelling waves do make
The mighty mountains high to shake.

There is a river fairly flowing:
Which shall refresh with joy renovvn
Of God most high, the sacred Town.

The LORD eternal has his dwelling*
Nor shall it move, for God will send
It early aid and it defend.

An^ moved to fury vnasvvaged;
Till they his voice had heard and felt,
That with the noise the earth did melt.
Pause.
The LORD of hosts with us appears:
The GOD of Jacob most of might,
Our refuge is, for us does fight.

The works of God, with admiration:
What he to pas on earth has brought,
What desolation there he wrought.

Throughout the world he them appeaseth,
He cuts the spears, he breaks the bovves,
And into fire the charrets throvves.

My might, my right is known and tried:
Ore all the heathen I will reign,
On earth exalted I Will remain.

The LORD of hosts is our salvation:
The God of Jacob gracious just,
Our refuge is in whom we trust.
Psalm 47. Rejoicing.
^

PEople of all Lands,
Joyful clap your hands
Praising God our King,
Shout, triumphant sing.
With a strong shrill voice,
Chearefully rejoice.

Far above the sky,
Is of dreadful might,
Terrible in fight:
Monarch over all,
Kings terrestrial.

Unto us make thrall,
He them down below,
Under us does throvv,
Nations shall submit
Themselves at our feet:

Chosen does advance,
Jacobs excellence
Is in his defense:
Whom he has approved,
And entirely loved.

Mirthfull marching on
With triumphant noise,
High expressing joys.
In the LORD rejoice,
With the trumpets voice.

Psalms to him accord,
Praise to our God sing,
Sing praise to our King.

Kings terrestrial.
Psalms instructing well,
Sing ye that excel.

All the heathen lands:
He does sit upon
His high holy Throne.

And with them combine,
Who themselves declare,
That they people are,
Of him that became
God of Abraham.
For God sole soueraign,
Does keep and retain
In his powerful hands,
All shields of all lands.
His fame high is raised,
His great Name be praised.
Psalm 48. Thanksgiving.
GReat is the LORD in this his seat,
His praises are exceeding great:
In our God's city his own dwelling,
His sacred mountain high excelling,

Full of beauty full of grace:
Northvvard being situated,
To the great King consecrated:
All the earth therevvith delighted,
To rejoice there are invited.

^

For refuge and deliverance shovvn.

They marched there in league combined.

They amazed took their flight:
They and all their troops astounded,
Terrifyde with fear, confounded.

Quite away they headlong hasted.
Such trembling fright hold on them took,
That they like traueling women shook.

Their Tarshish navy tore in sunder.

Like has now to us appeard,
In the city high renowned*
With the LORD of hosts name crowned:
Where remains the sacred dwelling,
Of the LORD our GOD excelling.
Pause. The LORD will it establish sure,
For evermore it shall endure.

Thy mercies are our meditation.

And the greatness of the same:
So is thy great praise transcending
To earths utmost ends extending.
Justice plentiful redoundeth,
In thy right hand it abounds.

Be glad, and let the joys surmount
Of Iudahs daughters amiable,
For all thy judgments admirable.

Towers built thereon recount.

Mark the Palaces perfection:
That ye may make the relation
To each future generation.

Is ever our defense and stay:
He is and will be our protection,
In life and death all our direction.
Psalm 49. Doctrine.
^

TO this my speech all people give good ear,
All dvvellers in the earth attentive hear.

All famous and obscure, both high and lore.

My hearts discourse shall understanding teach.

With harp expressed, my parable concealed.

When on me grief and trouble do incroch?
And when my sins and foes which do abound,
Me close at heels, pursevving shall surround?

And boasts of his riches insolent,

Nor ransom pay, at which God does esteem it.

For him to pay it shall for ever cease.

And in the pit corruption never see.

They perish as the brutish fool likewise:
At length their strength, health, wealth, breath, death bereaueth,
All he did own, to heirs vnknovvn he leaves.

Is that their house for ever may remain,
Their dvvellings to eternize, and their fames
From age to age their lands do bear their names.

That he being in honor, shall endure,
He bideth not, nor long this life enjoys,
Him like to beasts that perish death destroys.
Pause.
But vanity and foolishnes does tend:
Their children yet, all trained to their trade,
Approve, applaud, and laud what they have said. Selah.

Death on their flesh feeding, himself does glut.
But the upright all in the morning glorious,
Dominion shall have over them victorious.
Their beauty shall be waste in the grave,
Quite from the place where they their dwelling have:
But God will me redeem from povvr of hell,
For he shall me receive with him to dvvell.

When honors of his house do multiply. Selah*

His glory shall not with him go not tarry.

And to himself does good, they celebrate.

In place obscure, and never see the light,

But knowledge wants, still sensual senceles grows;
Nor understands at all what he enjoys,
Is like brute beasts whom sudden death destroys.
Psalm l. Doctrine*
^

THe mighty GOD, the LORD eternal blessed,
Has spoke, and called the earth from East to West,

Our God has shined, and shovvd forth glorious light.

His sentence just, in silence not concealing.
Before him fire devouring shall abound,
About him storms and tempests shall surround:

And earth beneath to judge his people all.

With me in league by sacrifice assigned.

For God himself is Judge most just and right: Sela.

I am thy GOD, to thee I Will testify.

Thy offerings made by fire do not move me.

Or Beeues or Goats in field or fold that feed.

The vvilde beasts all are mine in Parks or vvoods.

Beasts of the field are only mine I owe them.

The world and all therein belongs to me.

Can thou suppose that I Goats blood would drink?

And pay thy vows to God in him believing.

I will thee aid, thou shall me glorify.

My gracious Law in graceles lips assume,
Thy stubborn heart my counsels has disdained,
My sacred word thou have despis d, profaned.


His race thou run'st with strumpets league do make,
Adultrers lust with them thou do partake*

Deceit and lies it forgeth and compileth.

To scandalize thy mothers son with shame.

Thou thought me as thy self even such a one,
But I will thee reprove for every error,
And marshall them before thy eyes with terror.

You that neglect the Lord, and him forget*
Lest I do tear you when ye helples be,

Who orders aright his conversation,
To him will I declare the Lords salvation.
Psalm 51. Prayer.
Have mercy Lord have mercy most of might.
On me alas, most wicked wretch of vvretches;
According to thy mercies boundles riches,
Remit my sins, remove them from thy sight.

From th'odious fact my folly has committed,
And from my crimes so crying, fell, and foul,
By thy free Grace let me be cleard, and quitted.

My heinous sins, and my exceeding errors,
Still in my sight, with ghastly frights and terrors,
Incessantly my mind my soul torment.

And in thy sight I trespast and offended*
That what thou say may still have just record,
And evermore thy sentence be commended.
^


When first my breast this breath of life received,
In sin alas my mother me conceived,
A child of wrath, and less then nothing vvorth.

Within the heart, within the soul sincerity,
Therefore to me so gracious thou have bin,
To make me know thy inward wisdoms verity.

So shall I be reclensed to perfection:
O vvash me, vvash me from this foul infection,
So shall I pas the purest shovv for white.

From th'invvard voice of thy good grace relieuing,
So shall my bones which almost broken were,
Reioynd, rejoice, their former strength receiving.
Pause.
But hide thy face, and turn away thy terrors:
Wipe out my vveak my vvilde, my vvilfull errors,
And all my faults and follies manifold.

A new clean heart unto thy will inclined,
In me a new right spirit renouate,
From natural corruption, pure refined.

Nor from thy sight in thy displeasure drive me,
Nor of thy grace nor holy Spirit deprive me,
Nor in thy wrath abandon me for aye.

And saving health which I had once conceived,
With thy free spirit confirm me more and more,
That I of them may never be bereaved.

To know thy vvayes, and learn thy mercies ample,
And sinners shall be brought by my example,
Soon to return converting unto thee.

To expiate my brute and bloody madness.
Then shall my tongue thy righteousness extol,
And of thy grace sing praise with joy and gladness.

And then my mouth shall thankfully be telling
The wonders of thy glorious works excelling,
And of thy Name, the praises just record.

Although I should, else would I give thee many,
Burnt offerings are not pleasing in thine eyes,
Nor art thou wont to take delight in any.

Is a sad soul, a broken heart lamenting,
A contrite heart unfeignedly repenting:
These, these O God thou never do reject.

Upon thy mount for evermore extend it,
Build up the walls of thy Jerusalem,
Within direct it, and without defend it.

Oblations free, which thou thy self demandest:
The sacrifice which thou O LORD command,
Lambs, kids, and calves and every offering.
Psalm 52. Consolation.
^

IN mischief which thou multipliest,
And thy iniquity
Why vantest thou? and magnifiest
Thy self in vanity?
But yet know thou Gods goodness sure,
Does evermore endure.

Mischievous in thy thought,
Like to a rasor sharp it vvoundeth,
Pernicious fraud has wrought,

And falsehood more then right. Selah.

Rejoicing to do vvrong.

For ever, thou false tongue.
He shalll remove thee, quite deface
And pull thee from thy place.
Thee wretch from the land of the living,
He shall root out and tear. Selah.

And this behold with fear,
But they at thee shall laugh that day,
And in derision say,

To take God for his aid,
But trusted in his wealth abused,
And on his own strength staid.
Who sought himself to fortify,
In his iniquity.

Like to an olive tree,
And God will in his house me nourish,
Where planted I shall be:
For in his mercy I alvvay
Do put my trust for ay.

He praise thee without end:
And on thy Name with adoration,
Will I vvayt and attend:
For gracious is thy Name divine,
And good to all are t^ine.
Psalm 53. Doctrine.
THe fool in heart the holy God denies,
They are corrupt in all their enterprises,
To be abhord in all their exercises,
^

Good works none do, nor thereunto advise,
All are unwise.

To see if there were any understanding
To worship him, obeying his commanding:
He searched mankind, to see if any one
Sought God alone.

He found they were become abominable
In all their works, corrupt and d^testable.
Not one does good, none follovv God their guide,
All wander vvide.

That having got my people in their power,
They them as bread with greedy jaws deuovver*
They call not on the Lord of power immense,
Through negligence.

For God the Lord the bones of them has scattred.
Who thee besieged and those thy walls have battred:
Thou have them shamed of God despised they were,
Quite cast off there.

Salvation send? when back the Lord returns,
The grievous thrall, wherein his people mourns,
In gladness then, shall joyful Jacob dvvell,
And Israel.
Psalm 54. Prayer.
LORD GOD almighty save thou me,
By thy great Name my soul sustain thou,
And by thy strength my cause maintain thou,
And vouchsafe thou my Judge to be.

Thy sac^ed ear to me down bend thou,
And graciously O Lord attend thou
^o all the words that I shall say.
^


And mighty Princes tyranizing,
Do seek my soul to spoil surprising,
They set not God before their eyes. Selah

The LORD with them for ay remains,
Whose faithful love my soul sustaineth,
Them with his presence he rewards.

With their own mischiefs my enuyers:
Deal with them as thy truth requires,
Them all cut off and quite suppres.

Bring sacrifices acceptable,
And praise thy Name most honorable,
Replenisht with benignity.

Me from all trouble he enlarged,
My foes with vengeance he surcharged,
Mine eyes on them my will did see.
Psalm 55. Prayer.
O LORD hear thou my poor petition,
Hide not thy eyes at my contrition,
Do not despise my deprecation.

My cries, oh hear, my sorrovv see,
Regard my mournful meditation.

To vex, perplex me out of measure:
The wicked work me vilde vexation:
With most malicious madness they,
^

Foul blots and spots upon me lay,
With much despightfull imputation.

The pains and pangs of death assemble,
And me, oh me, have so surrounded,

My heart, each vital part to quake,
In vvoe I am vvound up and vvounded.

O that some one Doves vvings would give me
Whereby from dangers which enclose me,

Into some desert there to stay. Selah.
Where I might rest and safe repose me.

Fast would I fly svviftly be going,
Timely to seek some safe protection:

For I have seen their city full
Of rage and wrongs most foul infection.
With wickedness like walls enclosed,
Within, without, of sin composed.

All guilt and guile are in her streets,

There shameless sins are stoutly stalking.
Pause
And thus reproachfully abused me,
I could it better have endured:
Or had it been my open foe,
That rais^d himself to bring me lovv,
I might have hid my self immured.

Whose love to guide me had pretended,
With whom in secret often I talked.

And mutually took counsel svveet,
And to Gods house together vvalked.

Hels gaping mouth alive shall catch them:
For with them violence remains,
And in their dvvellings holds place.

The Lord me saues, and safe maintains.

At even, morn, noone to him I cried,
Who heard my suit, nor did deny me.

From bloody battle saved me.
For heavens angelike host stood by me.

Who ruled has, and reigned ever. Selah.
But he shall punish them deiecting,
Because that they no change do find,
Therefore Gods fear they do not mind,
With hearts obdurate him neglecting.

Against the peaceful raging furious,
Their cou'nant they have violated.

And seem as butter soft and smooth,
War in his heart is meditated.
Dissembling deep with honey speeches,
With crovvching, creeping, sly beseeches,
His ollyvvords like svvords have vvounded.

For he svveet succor will afford,
The just shall never be confounded.

Deceitful iuglers, vildly vicious,
Thou Lord vvilt bring to dire perdition.
They shall not live out half their days,
But thy sure help my hope shall raise,
And I will trust in thy tuition.
Psalm lvj. Prayer.
^

Have mercy LORD on me, for certainly
The cruel man at once would swallow me;
He fights against me daily furiously,
Oppressing me each hour.

And many fight against me with all their power,
O GOD most high in thee I trust, my tovver,
To thee in fear I fly.

Upon his Word, assured, secured thereby,
What man can do, no whit affrayd am I,
For I shall be defended.

To wrest against me daily they contended,
And all their thoughts to this are chiefly bended,
That mischief me they might.

They vvatch my steps in ambush day and night,
To have me in their povvr, they use their might.
At my life they have aimed,

By wicked plots and stratagems they framed.
Confound their hope O LORD, make them ashamed,
In thy wrath them down cast.
Pause.
And stored up my tears, none fall in vvast:
Writ in thy book, their memory shall last,
When I to God have cried.

My foes he will turn back all terrifyed;
This sure I know, for I have often tried,
That God is still with me.

And of his Word will I sing joyfully,
Because perform his promise sure will he,
The LORD is my salvation.

Therefore I will not fear the machination

To thee Lord will I pay.
Unto thee Lord will I give thanks alvvay,
And I will sing thy praises day by day,
To thee O Lord I will confess and say,
Thou Lord vvilt me deliver.

Of safety sure, so that my feet shall never
In danger slide, but upright walk for ever
In thy life's lightened way.
Psalm 57. Prayer.
^

THy mercy show, some pity take on me,
For O my God, my soul does trust in thee:
And till these vvoes and troubles be past over,
My soul does hope thou my defense vvilt be,
And that with thy vvings shade thou vvilt me cover.

Will I lift up my voice, and to him cry.

From heaven will save me from mine enemy,
Confounding him who seeks me to deuovver. Selah.

Among Lions fierce and raging, still to dvvell:
Among men set on fire, inflamed fuel,
Whose teeth are spears, and shafts sharp long and fell,
Whose tongs like svvords do vvound with words most cruel.
Pause.
And on the earth advance thy glory high.

My humbled soul down bovved, lovv does ly,
For me, my foes a deep pit have prepared.

And they themselves are fallen down into it. Selah.
Wherefore O God my heart is now prepared,
My heart O Lord to praise thee is made fit,
Thy praises in my song shall be declared.

For I my self will wake ere break of day.

To thee O Lord confessing I will pray,
And praise thy Name O Lord among the Nations.

Thy truth extends unto the cloudy sky:
Exalt thy self above the heaven supernall,
Let all the earth O GOD thee glorify,
And sound thy praise O Lord most high eternal,
Psalm 58. Consolation.
YE Rulers all to whom the trust is
Committed to defend the right
Against oppressors vvrongfull might,
Are all your judgments truth and justice?
Ye sons of men have you regard
To all just judgment to avvard?

Your hands with wrongs ye do pollute,
For cruelties ye execute,
The Land with measures false abusing.

From God are strangers alienate.
Even from the womb they have rejected
The truth for error, speaking lies,

^

With poysnous Serpents rage infected,
And like the Adder deaf, whose ear
He stops because he will not hear.

Though of all Charmers chief were he.

Within their yavvning mouths appearing,
Lord break the Lions cruel jaws,
Pull out their fangs, cut off their clavves.
Pause.
Away all unregarded fall,

Them scatter, shatter into shiuers.
Let them consume away as snailes,
That dry and die when moisture fails.
As vvomens fruit untimely dies,
Nere seeing light abortiue born,

Do prick or burn: swift vengeance flies,
And like a vvhirlvvind them alive,
With furious force away shall drive.

The righteous man right joyful be,
When he the wicked men shall see
Fall under vengeance dreadful measure.
He in the blood of wicked men
Shall vvash his feet. Man shall say then,

He shall the fruit and profit gain
Of all his labor, not in vain.
With plenty he shall be revvarded,
For sure there is a God of might,
That judges all the world by right.
Psalm lix. Prayer.
^

MY GOD, my enemies surround me,
Save me from them that would confound me,
Let me my God defended be,
From them that rise up against me.

save me from them that be oppressors:
From workers of iniquity.
From cruel men, and bloodthirsty.

To take my life, in vvait are lying*
Lord, mighty men their forces bend,
Against me, who them did not offend.

To punish me who nere offended:
Therefore arise, behold and see,
And with thy might assist thou me.

Is Isreal's defensive tovver:
The heathen visit thou, awake,
And on them all, due vengeance take.
To none let mercy be extended,
Who of mere malice have offended. Selah.

About the streets they rambling go.
^ike hounds they hovvl their mouths loud sounding,

^ith cruel lips like sharpened svvords,
For who say they do hear our words?

^isdainfully thou vvilt deride them:
and laughing at their lust disgrace,
^halt mock the heathen to their face.
^


On thee alone my soul attends,
For only God defends me,
My high tovvr of defense is he.

He shall prevent me with his fauer:
The Lord will surely suffer me,
On my foes, my desire to see.
Pause.
That our remembrance soon decay not:
But by degrees, them all abroad
Disperse, by thy great power O God.
Them all with shame down lovv deiect thou,
Thou art our shield* us Lord protect thou.

In sin, their lips with lies resound.
They in their pride shall be surprised,
For cursed plots which they devised:
For execrations, fraud and wrongs,

In thy fierce anger, fury fuming,
Confound thou them all quite, consuming,
That nothing may them ere restore,
Destroy them that they be no more.
That they may know, in Jacob reigns,
The God that evermore remains,
Whose rule and empire does extend
Unto the worlds remotest end. Selah.

Enraged mad with fury burning:
As dogs do grin, bark, vvhine and cry,
About the city rambling pry,

Sharking for meat, in hunger ranging:
And when they cannot satisfy
Their greedy mavves, they hovvl and cry.

And publish forth with heart unfeigned,
Thy mercy, povvr, and grace divine,
As soon as early day does shine.
For thou have safely me defended,
When I distressed on thee depended.

To thee O Lord I Psalms will sing,
For God is my fortification,
My high defense, and my salvation:
His grace to me, I ever prove,
The God of mercy, peace and love.
Psalm 60. Prayer.
O God thou did us quite reject,
And scattring us thou did deiect.
Thou have against us bin displeased,
Return to us, and be appeased.

Thou have it broke, and waste it laid.
The breaches and the broken shiuers,
Heal thou, for now it quakes and quiuers.

Great grievous troubles to endure,
To taste and drink did us assign
Abhorred cups of deadly wine.

To them that thee do serve and fear:
That thou have given to them a banner
To be displayed, thy truth to honor. Selah.

May by thy aid delivered be:
With thy righthand, them guard and save,
And let our prayr thy audience have.

I will rejoice in giving aid,
I Shechem will divide at pleasure,
And Succoth valley I will measure,
Pause. ^


As my possession I account:
Manasseh rich I will assign,
That it for ever shall be mine.
To me does Ephraim belong,
The chief part of my army strong:
And I the kingdom will deliver,
To royal Judah my Lavv-giuer.

Shall have employment, servile, base:
As they deserve, I Will them allot,
Under my feet to vvash the pot.
And as for Edom, this I Will do,
I over it will cast my shoe.
Ore Palestina that proud nation,
I will triumph in exultation.

Into the city builded strong,
For sure defense where I may bide,
Who into Edom will me guide.

Who us thy people did reject?
And thou O God would not instruct us,
Nor lead our armies, nor conduct us.

Against them that would us oppres:
Save us, for there is none that can
On earth, vain is the help of man:
God gives us valor to prevail
Against all them who us assail,
And he will by his mighty power,
Tread down them that would us devour.
Psalm Lxj. Prayer.

Who me assistance surely sends.

In greatest dangers dravving nigh,

Unmoved I stand, on firm foundation.

To harm the man that is upright?
A violent death shall you deuovver,
So shall ye all be slain and fall,
Like to a crazie broken wall,
And as a ruind tottring tovver.

Him of his honor to deprive:
And him deiect by their false dealing,
They in deceitful lies delight,
Their tongs do bless in outvvard sight,
But inwardly curse, spite concealing.

Attend and vvayt thou patiently:
From him is all my hope expected.

He saves me from violence,
Unmoved, I shall not be dejected.
Pause.
God is my Rock and sure defense,

Alvvay your selves to him convert,
To him confess, povvr out your heart,

Are lies, deceit, and vanity,
Of no account or reputation,
If in the balance they be laid
And with light vanity be vvayd,
They less appear in estimation.

The poor and vveak rob not nor vvrong,
Nor vainly trust in proud oppression,
If riches ye increasing get,
Your heart upon them do not set,
Which are uncertain in possession.

I heard his voice give this advice,
That unto GOD, all povvr pertains.

For by thy bounty every one
According to his work obtains.
Psalm 63. Prayer.
O LORD I have no God but thee,
I will seek thee betimes, in anguish,
For thee my soul with thirst does languish,
And often it faints, and fails in me.
My flesh such pining pain has tried,
For want of thee to ease my grief,
Longing to taste of thy relief.
In desert land, vnvvatred dried.

Behold thy power and thy glory,
Within thy sacred Sanctuary,
As I have seen thee heretofore.

Thy grace and love is unto me:
Therefore my lips shall unto thee
Sing lovvd thy land and praise inspired.

Still blessing thee while I am living,
And in thy Name, to thee thanksgiving,
My heart and hands will eleuate.

With marrow and with fatnes store,
With joyful lips I evermore
Shall praise thee highly glorified.

On silent bed I rest reposed
On thee to meditate disposed,
When nightly watches gard^o keep.

And I thy aid and help have had:
Therefore with thanks I will be glad.
Rejoicing that thy vvings do shade me.

Close cleaving to thee it remains:
Thy strength, my vveak estate sustaineth,
And thy right hand vpholdeth me.

My soul to slay or ruin it,
Fall headlong down earths deepest pit,
The greedy grave shall them deuovver.

Bloud-shedding hands shall overtake them,
A prey for Foxes they shall make them,
For vvilde beasts food they torn shallly.

In GOD whom he does serve and fear,
All that devoutly by him swear.
In him rejoicing, shall be glorious.
But hypocrites who craftily
Do exercise deceit and lying,
Their speech to falsehood vain applying*
Their mouths with silence stopped shall be.
Psalm Lxiiij. Prayer.

LOrd hear my voice and prayr ascending,
To me vouchsafe thy gracious ear,
Preserve my life safe from the fear
Of enemies, me succor sending,
My soul defending.

From secret counsel of all those,
Who wicked plots contriue, compose,
From sinners traitrous insurrection,
For my deiection.

They whet as sharp as piercing svvords,
They shoot their arrows, bitter words,
Backbiting with false speech beguiling,
They rail, reuiling.

They ly in ambush secretly:
At vnavvares, and suddenly,
Without all fear they shoot, not sparing,
Most boldly daring.

And therein obstinat abide,
Their talk is, closely snares to hide:
They say there is none who shall discry them,
Who shall espy them?
Pause.
Iniquities hid mysteries,
Inuenting still new villainies,
Thoughts, wits, hearts depth, all in them lying,
Thereto applying.

At them in wrath and anger fierce,
And his sharp arrows stroke shall pierce
Them suddenly with plagues, abounding,
Them deeply wounding.

Make mischief on themselves to fall:
And every one beholding shall
Fly from their vvoes abominable,
Insupportable.

Of this which God to pas has brought,
Considering vvisely what he wrought,
They shall behold with admiration,
His operation.

In God, shall in him put their trust,
And all in heart upright and just,
Shall glory in the Lord him blessing,
His grace confessing.

Prevailed against me,
Our trespasses, sins and transgressions,
By thee shall purged be.

Whom near thee thou do take,
That in thy courts of bliss possessed,
He may his dwelling make.
With good things in thy house of glory,
We shall be satisfi d
With blessings of thy sanctuary,
Content we shall abide.

LORD who do us maintain:
Thine answers avvfull resolution,
With fear we do obtain.
The earth and ends thereof reposeth
All confidence in thee,
Their hope whom farthest sea incloseth,
In ships or Isles that be,

Do hold the mountains, firm and stable,
Fast settled by thy might.

The peoples tumults are assvvaged,
Thou them do soon appease.

Who dvvell in utmost parts,
Thy signs and wonders formidable,
Do strike with fear their hearts.
Pause. The morn sets forth on's way ascending,
The even declineth down,
Their iourneys rising and descending,
Rejoice thee to renovvn.

And watered it thou have:
Enriching it thereon thou raynest,
Thy plenty it does taste.
The streams which thy large flood discharges,
The land does ouer-flovv,
Thy providence our store inlargeth,
Preparing corn to grow.

Thy rain does them redress:
Hard earth thou softnest, moisture shovvring,
The springing blades does bless.

Wherevvith the year is crovvnd:
Thy paths drop fatnes where thou go,
Thy steps enrich the ground.

On deserts dried earth:
The mountains all about surrounding,
With gladness, joy and mirth.

With flocks of cattle store:
And plenteous crops of corn do cover
The fruitful dales all ore.
With shoutings and shrill acclamations,
Loud peales of joy they ring,
With gladness, mirth, and exultations,
Svvet ^ongs of joy they sing.
Psalm 66 Thanksgiving.

TRiumph and shout with joy abounding,
In God, all people on the earth.

His worthy praise sing ye with mirth.

How terrible thou shevvst to be,
Thy great povvr shall thy foes bring under,
Faining subjection unto thee.

The earth shall all fear and adore;
And of thy praised Name the story,
They all shall sing still more and more. Selah

What vvondrous works from God do flow,
To Adams sons more povvr unfolding*
And dreadful acts then they can shovv.

Even in a moment suddenly*
They through the red sea dry foot iourned,
And there in him rejoice did we.

His eyes the nations do behold,
The rebel who him disobeyeth,
To boast himself shall not be bold. Selah*

By all the people far and near,
Let his high praise be so expressed,
That every ear the voice may hear.

Alive, refresht in him we bide*
Our feet from falling he sustaineth,
And will not suffer them to slide.

And proved how we are inclinde,
And as the silver purified
By fiery furnace flames refinde,

To be intrapped in the net*
Afflicting us thou have not spared,
And on our loins, distres have set.
Pause.
As on the back of horse or Ass,
As beast^ thou made us vile accounted,
Through fire and water we did pass.
But now since thou us here have placed,
In such a rich and vvealthy way.

Will sacrifice, and my vows pay.

And which my lips to thee did make
When I was grievously distressed,
And which my mouth in trouble spoke.

The fat of rams with svveet perfume:
Both Bulls and Goats of greatest prises,
Fire on thy altar shall consume. Selah.

To what I say, attentive be:
While by my tongue shall be expressed,
What for my soul performd has he.

His aid assisted me alvvayes,
Therefore my toug him magnified,
And highly did extol his praise.

If wickedness in me remains,
Me with neglect the Lord rejects,
He hears me not, my suit disdains.

Apparent proof thereof I find,
When I did pray, he did regard me,
Attentive he my voice did mind.

Who faild me not when I did pray,
Who from me when I was distressed,
His mercy did not take away.
Psalm 67. Thanksgiving.

By nations all with joy and mirth.

Shouts of joy be ringing,
Their acclamations,

Guide thou the Nations. Selah.

Be thou Lord, for thy gracious peace,
By people all be glorified.

All earths ends possessing,
In his fear shall live.
Psalm 68. Of praise public.
LEt God the povvrfull Lord arise,
And let his hateful enemies,
With fear and dread confounded,
Be all dispersed from place to place,
Fly from the frovvning of his face,
With ghastly terror vvounded.

Driven quite away, so let them be,
From Gods high presence banished:
As wax does melt before the fire,
So be the wicked in his ire,
Consumed for ever, vanished.

Be glad, his honor to record,
His worthy praise resounding:
Let them before the Lord rejoice,
Extolling him, lift up their voice
With mirth and joy abounding.

His sacred Name with praises crown,
Whose glory is supernall:
Who rides on the clovvdy sky,
In royal majesty most high,
Iah is his Name eternal.

Makes Rebels till the desert ground,

In wilderness them trying. Selah.

The earth did quake with terror great,
Thy face them terrifying,
When God, even Jacobs God drevv near.
When he in presence did appear,
The mountain Sina moved.

Thou on thy heritage did povvr
Thy bounty it has proved.
When it was weary, faint, and dry,
Thou did refresh it with supply.

Thou LORD preparedst for the poor,
Thou giust them of thy goodness store,
Whereby they are sustained.

And joyful tidings did afford
Amid thy congregation:
Fair troops of Virgins pure were found,
Who with triumphant thankful sound
Thereof made declaration.

Fled from the field in fear and fright,
Their shamed faces hiding:
Weak women wont at home to stay,
Marched bravely forth, and took the prey:
Rich spoils and lands dividing.

The fornaces of pots among
Besmeared and defaced
With mone^ soot all over soild,
And with hard labor ouer-toild
Obscured and disgraced.
Yet you a great change soon shall see,
For you made lovely bright shall be,
As Doves vvings silver cover,
In sight all glorious to behold,
With fethred plumes of purest gold,
All glittring, burnisht over,

Dispersed the Kings driven from the land
In fear and terror flying.
His peoples darkness turned to light,
And they became as pure and white,
As snow in Salmon lying.
Pause.
As Basan mount so near the sky:
As Basan mount excelling.

As if ye would us ouertop?
Against us proudly swelling:
This is the Mount God loves so well,
That therein he is pleased to dvvell:
His favor it obtains.
The Lord in grace and mercy great,
Has this elected for his seat,
For ever here remains.
^


Of Angels, which his povvr declare,
Attending he has millions,
The Lord among them shows his face,
As Sina's Lord in sacred place,
Possesses his Pauilions.

Thou captive leadst captivity,
O God of hosts victorious,
Thy gracious gifts thou do impart
To men, thy servants, for thou art
Most bountiful and glorious.
With them who of rebellious foes,
Become thy servants, thou with those,
For ay have habitation.

Who us with gifts does daily load,
The God of our salvation. Selah.

Of our salvation GOD is he:
Our Savior he remains.
The LORD eternal is most strong,
To him the keys of Death belong,
All power to him pertains.
Pause.
The heads of those that him vvithstand,
In hateful opposition.
And he will break the hairy pate
Of him that sins obstinate,
Procuring self perdition.

From Basan I again will take,
And bring you by my power:
And I will lead ye once again,
Safe through the gulf, the red sea main
Shall foes, not you, deuovver.

Dead corpses vveltring in their gore,
In blood may be imbrevved,
Of all thy foes that thee withstood,
Dogs tongs shall lick the purple blood,
From gaping vvounds issued.

My God, my King, how thy vvayes been
Within thy holy places!

The Rear on instruments did play,
They marched with stately paces.
On timbrels beating them among,
Triumphant Damsels sang this song
Amid their congregation.

O Israel, all ye that are
Of Jacobs generation.

And little, great and mighty grevv,
The chief of many Nations.
There royal Iudahs Princes be,
There zabulon and Nephtaly,
The Princely congregations.
Pause.
It is that thou so firm do stand,
Thy strong fortification,
Give strength to that which thou have wrought
For us, which thou to pass have brought,
O God grant confirmation.

To thy own Temple^ unto thee
Shall Kings bring gifts abounding:

The troops of spear men, armd for fight,
Their armies huge confounding.
Knock down the mighty multitude
Of Bulls and Calves, of people rude,
As in the shambles slay them,
Who glory in their silver spoils,
And who delight in wars and broils,
Defeat, disperse, dismay them.

The Mores in have shall stretch their hands,
And hearts to God thanksgiving.

Throughout the world to God Psalms sing,
And praise God ever living. Selah.

The heaven of heavens his ancient Throne,
Whose works are full of vvonder.
Behold, he makes his voice rebound
More dreadful mighty, strong in sound,
Then loudest noise of thunder.

In Israel his excellence:
Appears admirable,
His power let all magnify,
His strength is far above the sky,
His might unutterable.

For thou out of thy holy place,
Have all thy foes distressed,
Thy strength maintains thy peoples right,
Thou Jacobs God do give them might,
The Lord be ever blessed.
Psalm 69. Prayer and prophecy.
^

Save me O God, the waters me to drovvn,
To swallow up my soul, the seas are ready,
I sink in mire, where is no footing steady,
Plungd in the deep, the floods have me oreflovvn,

My throat is hoarse with doleful lamentation,

While on my God I vvait with expectation.

Then they that seek without cause to destroy me:
My foes with hate that wrongfully annoy me,
Are great and strong, prevailing mightily:
That I restord what I took not away,

Thou knovvst when, how, and where I went astray;
And from thy sight my sins are not concealed.

Whereby thou have thine own from foes defended.
With constant hope, who have on thee attended:
O let them not be put to shame for me.
Lord Isreal's God, O suffer no disgrace
For me be fall them that seek thy salvation,

And I endured reproach and defamation.
Pause.
Me as vnknovvn, my brethren have neglected,

Zeal of thy house has me consumed quite.
Reproaches which the wicked on me cast,
Are fallen on me, for thy sake I am blamed,

For which I was reproched and defamed.

Their by-vvord me the scoffers mock, jests breaking.

The drunkards sing of me, their pastime made,
While I O Lord my fervent prayer make
To thee alone in time of acceptance,
On me, in thy great mercy, pity take,
Hear me Lord in the truth of thy salvation.

Let me not sink therein, lest it confound me;
^

Free me from foes who hatefully surround me,
O let me not in waters deep be drovvnd,

Let not the gulf me swallow and deuovver,
Let none into the greedy grave me throvv,
Nor let the pit in tomb me in her power.

And for thy love and kindness, goodness treasure,
Acco^ding to thy mercies boundles measure,
Turn thou to me the favor of thy face.

For I in grief and trouble am distressed
Make haste therefore, my God, my gracious guide,
To hear my prayt which is to thee addressed.
Pause.
Redeem my life, with ransom quite discharge me:
From spiteful foes, from thraldom soon enlarge me,
And set me free from this captivity.

Thou see my shame, and how they do oppress me,
My enemies are all before thy face,
And in thy sight they are, that do distres me.

With heaviness, and sorrovv sick I languish:
I looked, but no^e I found bemone my anguish,
None would me aid, not one would take my part,
All comfortles amid my troubles great,
Not one was found to succor or to save me:

And in my thirst, sharp vinegar they gave me.

Their pleasures turn to be as snares unto them:
Their treasures make as trapfals to undo them,
Their joy to grief, their vvelfare change to vvoe.

That vvanting sight, the light may not avail them,
Their weakened loins, so shake continually,
That thighs and legs, and feeble feet may fail them.
Pause.
Pour out on them thy vvrathfull indignation:

And in their tents let none their dwelling make.

Whom thou have smit, their strokes have more abounded;
His sorrovves, their insultings more increase,
Whom thy own hand afflicted has, and vvounded.

Let them into thy righteousness come never:

And with the just, unwritten be their Names.

Raise thou me up, O God by thy salvation,

Extolling thee with thankful gratulation.

Then Ox or Bull, that horns and clou'n hoof vveareth,

Shall joy when they do see such things as these,
All ye that seek the LORD, your hearts shall live.

An ear to his own people he does give,
His prishers scorns not in their tribulation.

Praise him all seas, and all that therein moves:

And strongly will he Iudahs cities build,
The servants of the LORD therein shall dvvell,

Who love and fear his Name, which does excel,
Shall dvvell therein, and bide for ever blessed.
Psalm Lxx. Prayer.
^

O God in whom I trust repose.
Make speedy haste, me to deliver:
Make have O Lord, of aid the giver,
To send me help against my foes.

Let them with shame confounded be,
Let them that seek to ruin me,
Be turned back, destroyed, defaced.

Who say Aha, my harms delighting.
Be put to shame, the wrongs requiting,
Which they against my soul consult.

And joy in thee who seek thy face,
Let them that love thy saving grace,
Say evermore, the Lord be praised.

Make haste to help me miserable,
Thou art my aid, be comfortable,
O Lord, make thou no long delay.
Psalm 71. Prayer.
^

IN thee alone O LORD, my trust is,
And in thy holy Name,
Let me not suffer shame.

And for thy tender pity,
From dangers quite acquit me.
Incline thy ear to me, and guard me,

Whereto I may resort,
Thou gave express charge to safeguard me,
For thou art my tuition,
My rock, and my munition.

From hands of cruelty,
My God deliver me.

My trust on thee depends,
From my youth, still attends.

My shape thou there did frame,
From thence by thee I came,
And ever since thou have maintaind me.
Thy goodness high shall raise thee,
For ever I will praise thee.
Pause.
With vvonder me behold.
But thou art my strong hold.

And daily sing the story
Of thy eternal glory.

When I am aged old,
My failing strength uphold.
O do not leave me, nor reject me
When old age does ore take me,
O do not thou forsake me.

Against me every day
Do bitterly inuay.
and they who seek my souls betraying,
Do ly in vvait, and vvatch me,
Consulting how to catch me.

His God does him forsake,
^

Him now pursevv and take.

My God, thy help now send me,
With speedy hast^ defend me.

Which to my soul are foes,
Reproach shall them enclose,
To work me mischief, who presumed,

For thou vvilt safe defend me,
Pause. Thy praises more and more resounding,

Thy justice does excel.
Thy favors daily so abounding,
Can never be recounted,
So high they are amounted.

Thou Lord vvilt strengthen me,
That I preserved shall be:
By thy almighty power secured,
I will declare thy justice,
Thine only which my trust is.

The wonders thou did do,
I have shevvd hitherto:
Grown aged, gray, do thou conduct me,

When age does feeble make me.
Until thy strength I have recounted
To all that living be,
And to posterity.

O God incomparable,
Thy works are admirable
Pause. Lord who with thee may be compared,

Great troubles, grief and vvoe,
Wilt have thy love to me declared:
For my life was deprived,
By thee again revived.
In depths of earth I was interred,
Thou thence did me release.

To honor thou have me preferred,
With comfort me surrounding,
On every side abounding.

And sing with Psaltery
Thy honored verity
Of Israel, Lord God most holy,
With thanks I will confess thee,
My harp, my song shall bless thee,

Thy praise my Lord my King.
Thy glory high shall sing,
My soul shall merry make resounding,
Thy praises high esteemed,
Who have my soul redeemed.

Thy righteousness declare,
To publish shall not spare,
Thy love me from my foes releasing:
Which my soul would have vvounded,
For shame has them confounded.
Psalm 72 Doctrine of politic government.
Upon the King by thee elected,
Thy judgments Lord bestovv,
His princely Son by thee directed,
With justice thine endovv.

His justice may shine bright,
The poor oppressed with patience biding,
By him may have their right.

^

Bring peace and quietness,
And from the hills, as from pure fountains,
Shall flow forth righteousness.

Their children he shall save:
The wicked who have them oppressed,
Sharp punishment shall have.

They shall serve and fear thee:
As long as Sun and Moon endures,
To all eternity.

Upon the grass new movvn:
Dispersing moisture timely shovvring
On thirsty ground new sovvne.

To justice who incline:
Peace with abundance shall them nourish,
While moon or stars do shine.

From sea to sea shall stretch:
From great Euphrates, to earths ending,
His royal rule shall retch.

Shall bovv to him most just:
His foes fallen down in foul disgraces,
Shall lick the loathed dust.

The vvealthy Islands King,
The kings of Cush remote, yet loyal,
To him shall presents bring.
Pause.
And humbly him observe:
And all the Nations shall adore him,
Submitting him to serve.

Shall hear and set him free:
The poor with present aid supplying,
When helper none has he.

And pity on them have:
Deliverance he will send them speedy,
And he their souls will save.

From violence and lies:
Their blood shall dearly be esteemed,
As precious in his eyes.

From rich Arabia:
Prayr shall be made, ay to defend him,
And bles him every day.

Though sovvn on tops of hills:
The fruit thereof like Liban shaking,
The garners large fulfils.
The Citizens shall fairly flourish,
So numerous quickly grown*
As grass which fruitful medovvs nourish,
Millions of blades vnknovvn.

In glory high shall reign:
And his remembrance failing never,
Shall as the Sun remain.
All men by him of bliss possessed,
For ever bless him shall:
All Nations shall in him be blessed,
And him right blessed call.

Who wonders works alone*

For ay by every one.
Recorded be the sacred story
Of his renowned fame:
Let all the earth, filled vvirh his glory,
For ever bless his Name. Amen.
Psalm Lxxiij. Doctrine.
^

YEt sure the LORD is good and kind
To Israel, his love they find,
Who be of righteous conversation,
And serve him with pure adoration.

And near to miss the rightful way,
My feet did almost svverue aside,
And into error near did slide.

Vainglorious fools in dignity:
With grief of heart I was annoyed,
That wicked men such peace inioyed.

Until their death they feel no pain:
In health and strength they still remain,
And all things have at their command.

They know no sorrovv, take no care:
As other men they are not vexed,
They are not troubled, nor perplexed.

With jewels rich they are beset:
As with a garment for defense,
They armed are with violence.

With fatnes they so full are fed:
They have more then their hearts desired,
They are more high then they aspired.

Their speeches, wicked hearts declare:
They of oppression boasting tell,
Their words like mountains, proudly swell.
Pause.
Their lips with blasphemies unclose:
Their bold tongue uncontrolled talks,
Throughout the world unbounded walks.

Do thither turn, and with them go:
Quite tired out with grief and vvoe,
Drink of their cups, which full do flow.

From his so high supernall throne,
Does he regard, does he take notice,
Has he intelligence that so it is?

Their wealth, their might, their joys increase;
They still do live in rest, at ease,
Have plenteous happiness and peace.

Still in my innocence remain:
My heart from wickedness I cleansed,
My hands in righteousness I rensed.

And early in the morn betimes
Am I reproacht with grievous crimes,
And suffer severe chastisement.

Then do I vvrong, and falsely lay
A scandalous calumniation
Upon the righteous generation.

This doubt indeuering to resolve:
I found it was too hard for me,
The depth thereof I could not see.

Consulting with his sacred Word:
Where I their final end perceived,
Of all their comforts vain bereaved.

In slipry places soon to fall:
And suddenly did cast them down
Into destruction have them thrown;
Pause.
Forlorn in vvoe and misery:
With terrors errors, deadly vvounded,
For ever finally confounded.
Thou utterly do them deface,
And root them out from humane race,

But when one vvakes, is quite forgot.
When thou Lord vvakest, we arise,
Their image vain thou vvilt despise.

I in my reins was pricked and vexed.

Deprived of intelligence:
I in thy sight was as a beast,
And in my own account the least.

And so I hope shall ever be:
For thy right hand, me firm vpholdeth,
Which unto me thy love unfolds.

Shall guide me safely while I live:
And after when this life I leave,
To glory thou vvilt me receive.

But only thee who dvvelst on high?
On earth I none but thee desired,
To thee alone I have aspired.

My courage and my heart me fails:
God is the strength of my poor heart,
He ever is my choice, my part.

Destruction quite away shall take:
For thou have every one consumed,
False gods to worship who presumed.

To dravv near God to him addressed:
I trust in God, in him I rest,
By me his works shall be expressed.
Psalm 74. Prayer.
WHy Lord have thou for ever us off cast?
Why is thy wrath and fury so inflamed
Against thy flock, thy congregation named,
Thy pasture sheep, that thou forgot them have*
^


The rod of thy inheritance esteemed,
Thy mercy svveet has dearly it redeemed,
In Sion mount thy dwelling thou did hold.

^hy foes for their perpetual desolation:
Whose sacrilege and vvastfull deuastation,
Have all things in thy Temple ouerthrovvn.

With outcries fierce, and horrid exclamations,
Make war against thy sacred congregations,
Set banners up for trophes round about.

With lofty strokes, sharp axes, arms of vigor,
In forests thick, with mighty force and rigor,
Make haste to fell the vvel-grovvn Cedars down.

The polisht stones in corners of thy Temple:
They cut and spoil those buildings past example,
With axes and with hammers furiously.

Thy Sanctuary down cast, ruinated:
The dwelling place of thy Name violated,
All cruelties thereon they execute.

Destroy them all together, they have burned
Gods Temples all, and into ashes turned
All Synagogues of GOD, throughout the land.
Pause.
Nor any hope at all thy favor shows:
No Prophet now there is, nor one that knovveth
How long we shall endure this misery.

This vile reproach? this scoffing adversary?
^

Shall they blaspheme thy Name, thy Sanctuary,
For evermore? Both thee and us deride?

Thy mighty right hand, therewith us defend thou,
Us to restore, thy povvrfull arm extend thou,
For ever shall thy bosom it infold?

My royal King have bin, thou have me guided:
Thou have for me salvation sure provided,
Throughout the earth, from danger did me free:

The Dragons in the waters thou have killed,
The shores along, and rivers thou have filled
With monsters huge, slain in the main outright.

To them that dvvell in deserts to deuovver:

From out hard rocks, clear fountains fresh to spring.

The day, the night, at thy command abides,
Created were they by thy hand that guides
The shining Sun, and comfortable light:

The borders of the earth have situated:
The summer thou, and vvinter have created,
And all thy works thy pleasure do fulfill:
Pause.
Thy glory how they have reprocht, reviled:
How with their tongs the foolish have defiled
Thy sacred Name, which they blaspheme, despise.

Of wicked foes thy Dove, thy Dear, thy jewel,
Commit not thou to their hands, who are cruel,
For ever do not thou the poor forget.

For now the earth is full of caves obscured,
Wherein lurk thieves to blood and spoil inured,
Who with all rage and fury us invade.

Refuse not thou the cries of men oppressed,
Let not the poor be evermore distressed,
But give them cause to sing and praise thy Name.

Remember how the foolish folk defame thee:
How senselesly they do reproach and blaine thee,
From day to day, thy honor they despite.

Of those thy foes, with fury fierce enraged,
The tumults rude increase, still vnassvvaged,
Of enemies who up against thee rise.
Psalm 75. Thanksgiving and Doctrine.
^

LOrd our God, we will praise thee,
We will praise thee for thy Name:
And the glory of the same,
Near and deer appears to be,
This thy vvondrous works declare,
Which for us performed are.

Justly shall I judge the same:

And all that therein remain,
I shall set them right again,
All the pillars I sustain. Selah.

Do not bear your selves so bold:
You that wickedness uphold,
Lift not up your horn so high:

Speak notvvith such pride and scorn.

That preferment comes not forth
From the East, West, South, or North:
Being come, is not secure.

He sets up, and he puts down.

Flagons flowing with red wine,
He the mixture does assign,
And thereof he forth does povvr:
Wicked men out of this cup
Shall wring dregs, and drink them up.

To the God of Jacob praise,
Of his honor frame my lays.

But exalt the glorious might
Of all those that walk upright.
Psalm 76. Thanksgiving.
^

IN Judah, GOD the LORD is known,
He there has vvoon eternal fame,
In Israel of great renovvn,
And glory, is his mighty Name.

In Sion is his sacred dwelling.

Without compare his forces are:
Bovves, shafts, svvords, spears shields, shiuered were
By his hands, thunderbolts of war. Selah.

Then mounts of prey, O thou most glorious.

All spoiled are, have slept their sleep:
None of the mighty men could find,
Or hands or hearts themselves to keep.

Both horse and chariot slept, and drowned.

Thee all do fear, and only thee:
For who can stand before thy sight,
When angry thou beginst to be?

The earth did fear with silent wondering.

To judgment, giving sentence just:
Then were the meek on earth set free,
And saved, who in him did trust. Selah.

It to thy greater glory turns.
But of that rage what does remain,
Thou vvilt restrain without delay.

What hearts have vowed, let hands pay.
You that are saved by his safe guiding,
Who round about him have your biding.
From dangers freed, bring offerings free
To God with thanks, rich presents bear,
Who near and deer unto him be,
Whom all that feared are, do fear.

Terrestrial Kings with terrors frighteth.
Psalm 77. Doctrine.
WIth my voice to God I cried,
To him I my plaints applied:
I to God my voice did rear,
He to me gave gracious care.
In the day I was distressed,
To the LORD I me addressed.

Hands erected sought release.
Former comforts which I used,
My sad soul has now refused.

still my troubles did abound.
^

With my hearts desire unfeigned,
I unto my God complained:
Grief my soul did overthrow,
Being ouervvhelmd with vvoe.

Night and day awake them keeping:
Much amazement me assayld,
That to speak, my tongue me fayld.

Days of old, long since expired,
I considering, thought upon
Ancient years, times past and gone.

Which my tuned Harp afforded
Of Gods mercy, justice, might,
Meditated in the night*
In my serious meditation
I had much communication,
With my heart, much talk I found,
Soundly I my soul did sound.

Will he never more protect us?
Is his mercy ever gone?
Will he never hear our moan?

Will he show his favor never?
Never shall his grace preuail?
Shall his Word for ever fail?
Pause.
Quite forgot his mercy tender?
Can it be that our God has Selah.
Shut his mercy up in wrath?

This my weakness is, confessing:
But recall to mind will I,
Years of Gods right hand most high.

Of Gods actions full of glory:
All thy wonders wrought of old,
To remembrance shall be told.

Shall be all my meditation:
My discourse shall be upon
All the deeds that thou have done.

From thy sacred Sanctuary:
Nor can any Deity
With our God compared be.

VVorkest wonders by thy power:
Thou in all the peoples sight
Have declard thy strength and might.

With thine arm thou have redeemed:
Jacobs sons thou do defend,
And from Joseph which descend. Selah

Seeing thee were terrified:
Seas beholding thee did shake,
Depths with dread of thee did quake.

From the skies the waters shovvred,
With loud noise and dreadful sound,
Heavens high arches did rebound.

From the heaun's were heard thy thunders:
Lightning flashes flaming bright,
Gave the world amazing light.
Earths foundations moved, shaking
Fearfully, it trembled quaking:

Nor can there thy steps be shovvn,

Them like sheep thou have conducted
To the promised plenteous land,
By Moses and Aarons hand.
Psalm. Lxxviij Exhortation.
^

Attentive be unto my Law declared,
My people all, let your ears be prepared
The words to hear which my mouth now propounds,
My voice to you a parable expounds,
Which I will show, and unto you unfold,
Grave secrets hid, dark sentences of old.

When to us our forefathers have declared them.

To future times they shall be all revealed.
The praise and povvr of God shall be made known,
And all his works of vvonder shall be shovvn.

And he a Law to Israel has granted,
Which his command appointed and ordained,
That it should be established and maintained.

And fathers to their children it relate.

And nere forget his mighty operation:
To keep his laws, his statutes all observing,

Whose stubborn hearts were never set aright,
Nor to the LORD were faithful in their sprite.
Pause.
With bovves well armd, yet were they foild and vvounded,
Their valor all in day of battle faild them,
Who turned their backs as soon as foes assaild them:

And of his law refused to walk the way.

Those vvondrous works, and maruels admirable,
Which he to them had shevvd, they quite forgate them,
Unthankful they did not commemorate them.

In Egypt and in Zoan by his might.

Through midst vvherof his people he safe guided:
The sea like walls on both sides heapt he reared,

Did lead them forth by day and all the night,
A flame of fire made shine to give them light.

From whence as from deep streams, they drink received,

From whence at his command great floods there flovved.
The waters he made gushing forth abound,
Like rivers they did ouerflovv the ground.
Pause.
The most high God provoking, they displeased.

In vvanton lust, flesh meat of him requiring.
Full fed, complaint for dainty food they made,
Repiningly against the LORD they said,

A table full of plenteous food provide us?
Behold he smote the rock, that water gushed,

But can he give such store of flesh and bread,
That therewith all the people may be fed?

His patience mild to fury fierce was turned:
The fire did flame in Jacobs habitation,
On Israel ceazd his fierce indignation.

Nor did they trust to have him for their aid.

Unto the clouds that are above in heaven,
The doors vvherof to set vvide open he daigned,

Which he did give unto them for to eat,
And earthly men he fed with heavenly wheat.
Pause.
He gave the bread of Angels delectable,
Whervvith he them even unto fulness filled.
^


He in the heavens the East vvinde causd to blovv,
The South vvinde he brought thither in also.

As numberles as dust on them he povvred:
And fethred fowls, most delicate and dainty,
As sand on sea shore for abundant plenty.

And round about the tents where they did dvvell.

Their greedines he fully satisfied,
Their vvish he gave, his bounty exercising,

Their luxury and lust they did retain,
While in their mouths their meat did yet remain.

And slew the chief before he was appeased,
Of Israel, the choicest men selected,
He in his wrath, did smite them down dejected.

His vvondrous works neglecting they forgot.
Pause.
And their best years in sudden plagues and terrors.

They sought the LORD, for mercy they implore him:
And presently returned from their sin,
And early sought the LORD, his grace to vvin.

That God the strong rock is of their salvation:
The most high God, their sauer they esteemed,
Acknovvledging that he had them redeemed.

Their glosing tongue did flatter, fain and ly.

Disloyal, they his Law observed not duly:

Did pardon all their sins abominable.
He slew them not, but svvag'd his anger great,
Nor did he stir up all his vvrathfull heat.

They were but flesh, frail, feeble, vveake, and tender,
As vvinde does pass away, no more returning.

Did they provoke him in the wilderness,
In The desert grieve him by their wickedness!
Pause.
Ungraciously their gracious GOD they tempted,
And limited the GOD of povvr unbounded,
The holy one of Israel they bounded.

From all their foes did set them safe and free.

In Zoan fields shevvd signs reformidable:

He turned to blood, and filthy gory matter:
That they became so loathsome did so stink,
Although their thirst increased, they could not drink.

That greedily did them deuovvr, and stong them:
Them he with frogs corrupted and annoyed,

And their increase, to Locusts of the field,
Their works he did to caterpillars yield.

Their Sycomores with frosts and tempests blasted:

To thunderbolts he all their flocks exposed:

His furious wrath against them burnt like fire.
On them he took just vengeance for offending,
Enraged among them, evil angels sending:
^


Their soul from death, he nor vvith-held nor spared.
From Pestilence their life he did not save,
But their vvilde beasts he to the morain gave.
Pause.
Their firstlings all with deadly stroke he thrilled:
In all Chams tents, of all their youth the flovver,
And prime of all their strength, did death deuovver*

In The wilderness he safe did guide and keep.

To drovvn their foes, the waters he procured:
And them of fear, their foes of life deprived,

To borders of this mountain he them brought,
Which his right hand had purchased and bought.

His people he in their possessions placed:
To Isreal's tribes their lands by lot assigned,
Yet they were still to stubbornes inclined.

His statutes they neglecting quite forsook.

From his decrees, as their forefathers, starting
Aside, like to a bovv deceitful proved,

They him prouokt to irefull jealousy,
With idols vain, and grau'n imagery.
Pause.
To show his wrath, inflamed was proceeding:
He Israel abhorred and disdained,

In sacred Tent divine, which he did place
Among frail men, who were of earthly race.

The beauty of his glory was deprived
By force of foes: his people to the power

So deadly was his dreadful anger moved
Against his own inheritance approved.

Their Virgins praise, nor nuptial feast inioyed:
Nor were they graced nor given in wedlock sacred,

Their vviddovvs these events did not bevvail,
For them their life, or sense, or heart did fail.

His once beloved, as one from sleep avvaking,
As after wine a Champion strength renevveth,

His enemies so he behind them smites,
With pain and shame deserved, them requites.
Pause.
Nor as his choice, the tribe of Ephraim used:

Fair Sions mount which he loved and affected.

As palaces that be of highest grace.
His palace there, his holy habitation,
He stablished upon a sure foundation,
Like to the earth which he for ever founded,
To his elect so has his love abounded:

And from the folds of sheep he did him take.

And faithfully to feed his sheep he taught him:
Jacob to him, and Israel he committed
His heritage, and thereunto him fitted.

With wisdom them his faithful hand did guide.
Psalm Lxxix. Prayer.
^

THe heathen have thy heritage obtained,
Thy holy house O Lord they have profaned;
Jerusalem thy sacred habitation,
On heaps is laid, and brought to desolation.

To fovvls of heaven for prey;
Have cast without the city
Thy servants flesh made food
For vvild beasts of the vvood,
Inhumane void of pity.

Their blood despised, upon the ground was spilled,
Like water streams on every side it flovved,
A grave on their dead corpses none bestovved.

Reproach us and deride,
They scoff, and scorn and flout us.
We falsely are condemd,
Disgraced and contemd
By them that dvvell about us.

For evermore vvilt thou nere be appeased?
And shall thy wrath inflamed nere be assvvaged?
Like fire, still burns thy iealousse enraged?

That never thee did know,
On them thy wrath down power,
And on those kingdoms all,
Who never yet did call
Upon thy Name of power.

And on his race, destruction they have povvred,
They desert quite have made his habitation,
His dwelling place have brought to desolation.

O let all be forgot,
Which ever we committed.
Make haste our souls to save,
Thy mercy let us have,
For we are lovv submitted.
Pause.
Because of thy Names glorious exaltation,
Deliver us, for our safeguard provide thou,
For thy Name sake, all our offenses hide thou.

Where is their God I pray?
To them who God regard not.
In our sight make him known,
By vengeance on them shovvn,
Thy servants blood who spared not.

Before thy face, with favor be presented;
According to the greatness of thy power,
Save them alive, whom death threats to deuovver.

Seau'n-fold, do not delay,
Into their bosom render
Reproach and infamy,
Therewith they raild on thee,
Thy self O Lord remember.

The pasture sheep of thee our shepherd royal:
Thy praises sing in an eternal story,
From age to age, Lord of supernall glory.
Psalm 80. Prayer.
HEar us, thy Israel who feedest,
Who like a flock thy Joseph leadest
Vouchsafe to show, to us thy grace,
That we may view thy shining face.
Thou that do dvvell in majesty,
Betvveen the Cherubs gloriously.
^


Be Ephraims defensive tovver:
Go thou before thy Benjamin,
Before Manasseh, glory vvin:
Stir up thy strength, thy aid we crave,
Us now at length vouchsafe to save.

Return thou us, and shine before us:
Show thou to us thy glorious face,
And us inlighten by thy grace:
Defend thou us, and so shall we
By thy protection saved be.

How long shall thy wrath formidable,
Thus smoke against thy peoples prayr?

They drink the cups which thou do fill
With tears, which from their eyes distill.

Our enemies do mock and flout us:
Deriding us with scornful spite,

Thy face let shine on us, that we
By grace of thine may saved be.
Pause.
Have brought, the heathen have removed,
And planted it, them far did chase,

Where growing, it deep root did take,
To fill the land, thou it did make.

The neighboring hills, and mountains over:
The boughs it stretched forth abroad,
Were like the Cedar trees of God,

The sprigs to the rivers did extend.

All passengers their prey have made it:

Has rooted all up where it stood.
To herds of beasts it served for meat,
Until they it quite up had eat,

From heaven return thou favorable:
Behold and visit this thy Vine,

This branch see how it is decayed
Which for thy self so strong was made.

The fire has it to ashes turned,
They all shall perish at thy frovvn,

Who to thy right hand does belong'
Whom thou had for thy self made strong.

Revive thou us, and we shall ever
Call on thy Name, thy praises sing:

Let thy face shine on us, that we
By grace of thine may saved be.
Psalm 81. Thanksgiving.
SIng we with loud voice to God our salvation.
Make a joyful noise, Jacobs God praise we,
sing Psalms joyfully, sing with exultation.

Instruments among, Timbrel, Pipe, and Flute,

At appointed time, keep your festival,
Merry make, with all joyful cheer abounding*

Who did this decree still to be maintained.

When they being freed, did from Egypt range,
Of whose language strange, they the knowledge vvanted.
Pause.
Them I free did make, from base labor spared,
From taskmasters hard, under thrall constrained.

Set thee free from thrall, answering thee with grace
From the secret place of dark clouds and thunder.
Yet at Meribah waters of contention,
I thee proved which way thy heart was inclinde,
Vndermin'd thy mind, sounded thy intention.

Thou to me art dear, O my Israel
Mark what I shall tell, give good ear unto me.

To them do not bovv, no false gods adore,
Nor their aid implore, thee from me estranging.

Thou my povvr did try, I did set thee free
From the cruelty of them that ore-vvrought thee.
Pause. Thy mouth open vvide, it shall be fulfilled,
Thou shall be supplide daily more and more
With my blessings store, down on thee distilled.

My voice would not hear, and my Israel
My words did repel, me their God they slighted.

Let them as before walk in vvayes unjust,
To themselves to trust, and their own inventions.

My words which ye heard, O that Israel
Whom I loved so well, had not from me strayed.

Who had bin thy foes, all that the^ distressed,
I would have suppressed, with my hand pursevved.

Shall submit for fear, and their time shall sure
Evermore endure, it shall be eternal.

Fed them with svveet meat, them with honey sild,
From the rock distild, I had satisfide them.
Psalm 82. Doctrine.
^

GOd is amidst the congregation
Where Princes meet in consultation.
As Judge supreme, his place he takes
Among Judges, whom as Gods he makes.

Avvard such sentence as unjust is?
Far off from equity ye err,
For ye the vvickeds cause prefer Selah.

Relieve the fatherles, distressed.
The guiltles innocent defend,
And to the helples, succor send.

Who are afflicted, poor and needy:
Them free from their oppressors hand,
Their wicked cruel foes vvithstand,

Nor will they understand or shovv it:
They walk obscure without remorse,
That all the earth is out of course.

Be not deceived nor beguiled:
For though unto you this said I,
Ye children are of the most high.

For ye shall die as men, as mortal*
As earthly Princes, so ye shall
From high estate, dejected fall.

And govern thou all congregations:
For to inherit, appertains
To thee all that on earth remains.
Psalm 83. Prayer.
^

IN silence Lord hold not thy peace,
Delay not thou, nor longer cease:
Defer not Lord, be still no longer,

Exalt themselves, thy povvr despising,
Make head against thee, still grow stronger.

Take counsel them to undermine:
They meet in secret consultations,
Against them whom thy bosom hides,
For whom thy secret love provides*
They plot mischievous machinations.

And cut them all quite off, they said,
That they may cease be a Nation,
That they confounded and ashamed,
May Israel no more be named,
But lose their names commemoration.

Against thee they a league do make.
The Edomites and Ishmalitish,

And those that be of Hagars nation,

With them does Amalec conspire,
The Philistims and they of Tire,
Together have their forces joined,

His arm of strength, and fortified
The sons of Lot, with them combined. Selah

As once thou did when Kishon strem
The Midianites drovvnd and destroyed,
As Sisera and Iabin flying*

Became as dong, the fields annoyed.
Pause.
Their Kings and them like to Zeeb.
Like Zeba and Salmana Princes,

Of all Gods houses to posses us,
And them adioyn to our Provinces.

As chafe or stubble, tumbling reeles,
Which circling round, the vvhirlvvind turns,

The fire consumes, flame scorching seareth,
The mountain tops to powder burns.

And suddenly consume, confound
With tempests of thy fury fiery,

That they thereby may be constrained,
After thy Name to make inquiry.

Let them be utterly destroyed,
And make them know this understanding,
That thou alone art God eternal:
Dread sovereign Lord, supreme, supernall,
Heaven, earth, and all therein commanding.
Psalm 84. Prayer.
^

LOrd God of hosts, how lovely fair,
How svveet thy dwelling places are:
How pleasing and how amiable
My longing soul faints with desire:
That to thy courts I might aspire,
Whose beauty is so admirable:
My heart, my flesh* does pant and cry*
The living God to come more nigh.

The swallow with her young do nest
Near to thy Altar safe abiding,
Lord God of hosts, my God, my King,
O when vvilt thou me thither bring,
My steps unto thy Temple guiding*

There still they will be praising thee. Selah.

To whom thou favor vvilt impart:
Their heart to thy path-vvayes applying,

Through places dry, where tears do ^ovv:
On thee the well of life relying,
Deep pits they dig in thirst and pain,
For springs to fill, and shovvrs of rain.
Pause.
Till Sion they attain unto,
Before the Lord their God appearing.

Does guide and govern all by right:
Grant my request, my prayer hearing,
Lord God of Jacob, when to thee
I make my suit, give ear to me. Selah.

Of thy anointed, look with grace,
For better is one days abiding
With thee, then thousands elsewhere be:
Much rather would I choose for me
To keep thy gates thereat residing,
Then lord it with the wicked train,
Chief in their Palace to remain.

He is a sun and shield to us:
Our God will give grace and salvation,
With glory high to be extolled:
And no good thing will he vvith-hold
From men of upright conversation.

Whose hope and trust in thee does rest.
Psalm 85. Doctrine.
^

LOrd to thy land, thy grace thou did declare,
Thou Jacob have freed from captivity,

Thou have forgiven them their iniquity.

The fiercenes of thy wrath thou did assuage,

Cease thou thy wrath against us, which does burn.

For ever vvilt thou with us angry be?

That people thine may all rejoice in thee.

Thy saving health on us daigne to bestovv:
With favor thine, vouchsafe us to embrace,
Once more let us enjoy thy glorious grace.

That I may know what he to us will say:
He will speak peace to whom he love does bear,
And he his Saints from sins relaps will stay.

To him for aid, is his salvation nigh,
Which to his own is surely near at hand,
That glory may inhabit in our land.

Justice and peace each other kissing greet:

And righteousness shall look dovn from the skies.

And fruitful make the land yield large increase.

All shall go right and strait, not one shall stray.

Shall citizens become, and natives there:

All people had their birth and education,

The people there recounting, he will write,
The Nations and all others born in Sion. Selah.

Thus says the Lord, in Sion shall abound

Psalm 88. Prayer.

Eternal Lord, my Sauer dear,
Both day and night my cries implore thee,
O let my prayer come before thee:
Unto thy presence entering near:
Incline to hear, thy ear applying
To my sad plaints, and rufull crying.

My life draws to the grave near ending,

In dungeon deep account they me,
To help my self I am unable,
A strengthles man, poor, vveak, unstable.

As if some murdrous hand had slain me,
And that the grave did entertain me:
As if thou had forgotten me:
As thy remembrance me had balked*
As from thy hand I were defalked.

In darkness deep uncomfortable,

To ouerpres me thou have made.
With all thy waves thou have me vexed,
With storms and tempests me perplexed. Selah.

Thou have removed, they care not for me,
Whom late they loved, they now abhor me,
And thou have shut me up in thrall,
Close prisner made in such a tovver,
From whence to escape, I have no power.
Pause.
O Lord to thee my grief unfolding,
I daily call, my hands upholding.

And vvilt thou them with power enable,
To know thy wonders admirable? Selah
Shall dead men rise to magnify
Thee, with whom none may be compared,

By them that in the grave do ly.
Shall they whom thou have quite destroyed,
To praise thy justice be employed.

Where darkness evermore remains,
In The land vvherin oblivion reigns,

With these my cries, Lord I implore thee,
My early prayr shall come before thee.

And hid'st thy face from me in anguish,

Expiring, present death expect.
Enduring thy affrighting terrors,
Distracted still with doubtful errors.

Thy horrors, fears, dismay, confound me,

On every side continually.
The dread of them does make me tremble,
Who to beleaguer me assemble.

My fellovv friends which me have loved,
From me far off thou have removed,
Their former love to hate is changed:
They in my grief no favor shovv me,
In darkness hid they will not know me:
Psalm 89. Prayer.
^

THe mercies of the Lord I Will sing continually:
To ages all record his truths fidelity.

His grace does ay endure, established, verified.
As heaven perpetually, keeps course inuariable,
So his fidelity, much more is firm, and stable.

I have a covenant made, and svvorn it to effect.
On David and his race, who is my servant loyal,

His throne I will advance, and build his habitations,
For his inheritance, throughout all generations.

Thy faithfulness alvvaies among thy Saints shall shine.

Remaining in the sky with thee to be compared?
Or who the children are of mighty States supernall,
May they with thee compare, who art the Lord eternal?

To all about him round, most reverend is he.

With thee in povvrfull fight, what lord is comparable?
Thy avvfull majesty is all about surrounded
With faithful constancy which ever has abounded.
Pause.
When waves thereof arise, thou them do soon appease.

Thy foes thou have orethrovvn, thy arm them dissipated.

The worlds store thou have founded,
By thy great povvr divine and by thy might unbounded.

West Tabor, Hermon east, in thy Name shall be glad.

That thy right hand is placed on high thou have declared.

Thy truth and clemency before thy face remains.

Their hopes do never mis, their comforts do abound:
Lord they their walk shall frame, in light of thy face shining,

Thy justice to confess, They shall be dignified,
And in thy righteousness on high be magnified.

Thy favor if we gain, our might shall rise on high.

He only is the Lord whose power does defend us.
He is out King alone, by whom we are redressed,
Who is the holy one of Israel most blessed.
Pause.
And thou did him acquaint with thy will: thou have said
To him in vision, this my aid I have assigned
To one who mighty is, and him thereto inclined,
I one have raised high, on him my grace conferred,


He shall reign stablished, my arm shall make him strong,

Nor force nor subtilties shall be to him injurious.
The sons of wickedness shall not deuovvr nor vex him,
They shall not him oppres, nor have povvr to perplex him.

Who hate him, I Will disgrace, and with sore plagues annoy

His horn of strength shall be in my Name highly graced.

And make his other stand ore Euphrates extended.

In honor far more high then are the Kings terrestrial.

My faithful promise past shall stand for him secured.

From my just judgments fall, and loosely run at randon.

And keep not my behest, and precepts I ordained.

With chastisement severe, my strokes on them shall light.

To them my faithfulness shall not be abrogated.

My Word I will maintain and keep inviolable.

That I the truth expres, and to him will not lie.

Cast to the ground, destroyed, profaned his crown royal.

To ruin brought, orethrovvn his strong fortifications.

To all the dvvellers nigh, he is become a scorn.

The hearts rejoice alvvaies of his foes and contraries.

In battle put to flight, by thee with fear amated.

His throne of regal fame, thou have cast to the ground.

And couerd him alvvaies with shame in grievous measure.

For ever shall we bide thy wrath like fire burning.

Why have thou in this sort made all men be but vain.

Or who his soul can free from graves fast holding power?

To svvear thou did accord, to David truth assured.

How in my breast is born the shame, reproach, and spite

They scoff with speeches rude, the paths of thy anointed,

The Lord bles evermore, Amen, Amen, for ever.
Psalm 90. Prayer of Moses.
LOrd thou have bin to us a habitation
From age to age in every generation:

Long time before thou laidst the earths foundation,
Before all things received form from thee,
Thou Lord art God from all eternity.

When thou do say return ye creatures mortal,
To dust, from whence ye were at first produced.

As yesterday are passed in thy sight*
Or as a vvatch, one quarter of the night.

They vanish as a dream in sleep decays,
As when the morn his early beams displayeth,
The flovvring gras does flourish fairly growing.

And being movvn, is turned to vvither'd hay.

Through thy just wrath, and thy deserved displeasure,
We troubled are, and fearfully annoyed.

Before thy face appears, before thy sight,
And thou have brought our secret sins to light.
Pause.
The heavy weight of thy just indignation,
Our years do end like to a brief narration.

To seventy years, but if by natures strength
It eighty reach, we count it vvondrous length.
Of all our life the flovvr but sorrovv being,
But grief and pain are our best days of vigor,
Cut quickly off, and we away are fleeing.

For as we are affected with thy fear,
Even so to us thine anger does appear.

Our days to count, and times of life swift flying,
That we our hearts to wisdom true applying,
It safely may to thee the way conduct us.

And let thy rage against thy servants cease.

And with thy grace, that we with mirth and gladness
May all our days rejoice in thy salvation,

VVherin we have so much afflicted been,
And of the ills which we have felt and seen.

To servants thine, and their seed be declared.

Our handy works establish and protect.

From evils that contagious are,
He will thee safe deliver.

His vvings will safeguard yield thee:
His truth will thee defend and guide,
And as a buckler shield thee.

Of horrors terrifying,
Nor yet the arrow by day light,
That deadly vvoundeth flying.

Nor for the plague, whose violence
At noone day light destroys.

All dangers quite shall clear thee,
Thereof have thou no fear at all,
It shall not once come near thee.

Receive their full revvarding.

To keep thee that thou safe may stand
In all thy vvayes thee blessing.

With them in safety biding,
Lest thou thy foot do dash or tear
Against a stone down sliding.

And trample on the Dragons head,
No harm at all receiving.

And all that work iniquity,
Themselves still vanting, grow so proud.

Where they my mighty works did see,
Beholding them with admiration.

So long this people vexed and grieved me,
I said in heart this people err,
Before my vvayes they theirs prefer,
They have not known mine, nor belieu'd me.

Since they my words and works forgot,
Into my rest they enter not,

Thy judgments Lord to know,
Which thou to them did shovv,
Has brought great consolation
to Iudahs generation.

^boue all the earth and sky,
Thou art exalted far
above all gods that are,
To thee can none come nigh.

Abhor all lewd devices,

His Saints lives he does save,
Keeps their souls from the grave.
Pulled from the wicked hand
of Tyrants in the land,
By him they freedom have.

Delight and joy he gains,
Whose heart upright remains:

your selves to mirth addres:
The Lord God praise and bles,

Record his Holiness.
Psalm 98. Doctrine and prophecy.
^

SIng to the Lord new songs delightful,
For he great vvondrous works has done:
His holy arm of justice rightful,
His right hand victory has vvon.

Most gracious to all made known:
And in the sight of every Nation,
His justice openly has shovvn.

His mercy and his verity,
To Israel his servant loyal,
He shevved his fidelity.
Throughout the world, the Lords salvation
Has clearly manifested been.

Let all the earth be joyful seen.
With loudest shovvts, and shrillest noyses,
Rejoice and sing with instrument.

To praise the Lord, new Psalms invent.

With trumpets, and with Cornets sound,

The world and all therein rebound.

In sign of joy shall clap their hands:
The hills also their gladness shovving,
Rejoice together in all lands.

To judge the earth comes speedily:
He to the world, just judgment gives,
And to the people equity.
Psalm 99. Consolation.
GOd the Lord does reign, suprem does remain,
People obstinate, quake amazed thereat:
He does sit upon Cherubims his throne,
Let the earth be moved,
which his povvr has proved*

He is high ore all, people serve him shall.

For his great Name solely,
dreadful is and holy.

He makes permanent, all just government:
He in Jacob wrought, and to pas has brought
Righteousness prepared,
judgment just declared.
^


Serve him as is meet, prostrate at his feet,
To him be submis, for he holy is.

Aaron Priest ordaining.
Pause. He set Samuel, where the Priests do dvvell,
For the people all, on his Name to call:
They to God did pray, who heard them alvvay:
When to God they cried,
he to them replied.

Where his pillar bright, gave them fiery light:
They did him obey, vvalking in his way,
Did what he would have them,
Kept the Law he gave them.

Down thy gracious ear, for they ansvvered were:
Thou O God do live, who did them forgive:
Though some were corrected
for their crimes detected.

Let us evermore, him serve and adore:
By his sacred will, at his holy hill,
For our God is solely,
glorious and most holy.
Psalm 100. Thanksgiving.
^

ALl people dwelling on the earth,
Sing to the Lord with joy and mirth:

Approach his presence, sing, rejoice.

It is that made us has, not we,
We are his people, he does keep
Us safe, as his own pasture sheep.

And in his courts give thanks alvvayes:
Unto the Lord let us confess,
His sacred Name with praises bles.

His mercy and benignity,
His truth and his fidelity,
Endure to all eternity.
Psalm 101. Doctrine of policy.
^

OF mercy mild, with judgment just uniting,
Now will I sing to thee O Lord, inditing:
The Psalm I sing, to thee my God belongs,
Such Psalms, such songs.

And I at home my works will order vvisely:
Until my heart sincere approach thy sight,
All blessed, all bright.

Backsliders deeds by me are ever hated:
These, all of these my heart shall quite disdain,
Refuse, refrain.

With wicked men, whose works with sin are tainted*
From me a lewd and froward perverse heart,
Shall pack, shall part.

Their neighbors name, by me shall be confounded:
I never could a supercilious look,
Once bear, once brook.

On faithful men to be by me protected:
The man that lives religiously with me,
Shall honored be.

Shall never have with me cohabitation:
A liar from my presence presently,
Shall fall, shall fly.

All wicked men accustomd to transgression:
Not one of these in Gods all holy land,
Shall stay, shall stand.
Psalm 102. Comfort.
^

TO my prayr O Lord attend thou,
Gracious ear to my suit bend thou:
Let my cry come unto thee,
Do not hide thy face from me.

When I am with grief oppressed:
When I call, afflicted needy,
Daign to me thy succor speedy.

In the air, as smoke that sumeth:
Burnd and parched are my bones,
As an hearth of mouldred stones.

Like the vvitherd gras is blasted:
Bread I eat none, though they set it
Ready for me, I forget it.

Dry my skin to my bones cleaving.

In the wilderness alone.
Like an ovvle it self that hides,
In the deserts vvilde abides:
To the vvoods alone retiring,
Solitarines desiring.

On the house top trembling frighted:
Or in covert out of sight,
I vvatch restles all the night.

Me reproach, against me furious,
To destroy me are enraged,
Against me are by oath engaged.

Which in sted of bread has fed me:
All my drink is mingled still
With the tears my eyes distill.

To my trouble and vexation,
Me on high has elevated,
Down again precipitated.

Like a shadovv are declined:
Wasting they away do pas,
I am withered like the gras.

Art for evermore eternal:
Thy memorial dureth ever,
To all ages failing never.

Povvrfull justice exercising*
Thou vvilt show thy mercy great,
On thy Sion thy own seat.
For if ever thou vvilt save her,
Now is time to show thy fauer:
To compassion be inclined,
Now is come the time assigned.

Have thy servants much affected:
^

Mouldred dust thereof does move,
Them to pity which it love.

Shall submit, thy great Name fearing:
All the Kings on earth aspiring,
Shall thy glory see, admiring.

Shall rebuild his sacred Sion:
He shall in his glory bright
Unto all appear in sight.

Of the poor in tribulation:
When the destitute complains,
Their complaints he nere disdaineth:
Pause.
Shall be writ this declaration:
That all ages may relate,
And with praise it celebrate.
People which shall be created,
To Gods service consecrated:
Shall sing praises and thanksgiving,
To the Lord God everliving.

Looked down from his sacred Temple:
God did view with gracious eyes,
Lowly earth frem lofty skies,
For to hear the prisners groaning,

To release their bonds inclined,
Which are unto death assigned.

They may celebrate the story:
And declare his sacred praise
In Jerusalem alvvayes.

Meet in frequent congregations,
And the kingdoms povvr combined,
Ioyn to serve the LORD inclined.
Pause.
And my days abreuiated,

O my God, my only aid:
In my mid age, do not take me
Quite away, nor yet forsake me,
For thy years endure for ever,
Through all ages, failing never.

And by thy hands operation,
Thou the heavens have framd and made,

But thou shall endure, remaining,
Ever blessed state retaining,
They shall all grow old, appearing
As a garment torn with vvearing,
As a robe, so shall their fashion
By thee suffer alteration:
From their former shape estranged,
They shall certainly be changed.

Thou art still the same eternal.
Thou art infinite transcending,
Thy years never shall have ending.

Shall continue firm, unmoved:
Thy grace shall them all sustain,
Their race ever shall remain.
And their seed from them proceeding,
Their posterity succeeding:
Shall for ever dvvell before thee,
In thy presence to adore thee.
Psalm Ciij.
^

MY soul praise thou the LORD for ever blessed,
Let all that is within my povvr possessed,
His holy Name extol and magnify:

Which he on thee bestovvd, forget not any,
But bles the Lord my soul, him glorify.

Who all thy sins defaceth and forgiueth:
When vveak and sick, he makes thee strong and sound,

Who ever thee most tenderly affecreth,
Has thee with grace and boundles bounty crovvnd.

VVherby thy (...) with vigor he supplyeth,
And he renevvs as the eagles, so thy youth.

The vvronged poor against him that oppresses,
Relieuing them in righteousness and truth.

So manifest all Israel might know them,
And his great acts so vvondrous, so renovvnd.

To wrath is slow, his anger soon declineth,
In mercy he does plenteously abound.

Yet will he not continue alvvaies chiding:
Nor will he long keep anger in his heart.

Nor with sins due, our sinful souls revvarded,
Nor deals with us according to desert.

So is the Lord in mercy, great and gracious
To all that fear him and on him do rest.

Has all our sins and trespasses removed,
As far from us, as the East is from the West,
Pause.
His pity mild, although it him offends,
So does the Lord them pity, who him fear.

Does well record our frailty, and our feature:
In mind does bear how soon to dust we wear.

Like gras or hay which instantly does wither:
As fragrant flovvrs do flourish on the green,

They soon are gone, their place no more them knovveth;
They fail and fall, they shall no more be seen.

His childrens state he evermore sustaineth,
Who worship him with fear in verity.

Who truly know, and do his will and pleasure,
His justice is to all posterity.

The Lord has plac d his regal Throne eternal,
And rules the world by his imperial might.

To work his will, by all means most expedient,
Publish, proclaim his honors glorious right.

His Ministers, praise ye his Name all glorious,
You that are pressed, addressed to do his will.

Yea, let my heart, my mind, my spirit laud him
And all within me, prise and praise him still.
Psalm 104. Praise.
BLes thou the Lord my soul, O Lord my God,
Thy greatness far exceeds all abroad:
Thou majesty most glorious daily vvearest,
With honor thou most beautiful appearest.
^


As with a robe, thy self thou do adorn:
The firmament bedeckt with stars extending,
Like curtains drawn forth by thy povvr transcending.

Upon the seas and waters gushing streams:
Thou on the clouds which in the air are byding,
Triumphant come, as on a chariot ryding.
And when to walk it is thy sacred mind,
Thou marchest on the vvings of every vvinde.

Thy Ministers are like a fire flaming.

On bases thou did set, so fastly found:
That thou have made it ever firm and stable,
No povvr but thine to move it shall be able.

As underneath a mantle close do keep:
Whilst thou great God did cause the watery fountains
To rise and flow, and stand above the mountains.

They past away, and fled as all afeard:
And at the voice of thy most dreadful thunder,
They haste away, each one their way a sunder.

Down by the dales they lovv descend again:
Until in their own place they be surrounded*
Which at the first for them thy wisdom founded.
Pause.
The surging waves restraind, can never get:
Lest if they should at any time pas over,
The surface of the earth they would recover.

The vvholsom svveet clear water of the Spring,
Which midst the hills a pleasant murmur keeps,
Whilst through the vales the silent current creeps.

To every beast that rangeth in the field:
And the smooth brook, which here and there still passes,
Does quench the thirst of vvilde and savage asses.

To make their nests, abiding day and night:
By thee each bird melodious notes aduances,
Amidst the trees young tender slender branches.

With shovvrs of rain, enricht the fertile hills,
Yea the whole world with his works fruits abounds,
And satisfied therewith, his praise resoundeth.

The brutish beasts he does provide for so:
And for man's use, the useful herbs he planteth,
That they may till the ground, which labor wants.

To cure the sad, and to make glad man's heart.
He makes oil, which makes men's faces shining,
And bread that breeds hearts strength, the povvrs combining.

In sap, in growth, either for show or meat:
The Cedars high on Libanus that grows,
Gods plants, not man's, then man's more goodly shovveth.

By native skill, and take therein their rest:
As for the storke, while other likes others,
Amidst the firs her and her young she smothers.

Their refuge they do make, and sport their fills:
On the other side among the rocks so stony,
Thou placest safe the vvilde and fearful cony.
Pause.
From West to East in seasons fit to range:
He makes the Sun know his fixed course near slovving,
In the East his rise, in the West his dovvnvvard going:
^


The glorious day is turned to obscure night?
Within their dens, the forest beasts all sleeping,
Out of their dens then boldly all come creeping.

Do rage and rore incessant for their prey:
These seek their food by mere instinct with crying,
From the strong God, their want of food supplying.

They gather them in one, and homevvard run:
There in their dens, close couching they repose them
Till night, so that no eye can there disclose them.

To labor, where the field him profit shows.
In husband^y, whose painful toil nere ends,
Till toward even, the shadovv longer tends.

Thy vvondrous works, they are so manifold:
From wisdom of thy providence proceeding,
The earth is full of riches, thine exceeding.

Stretching its arms to every creek and key:
Where swim and creep creatures innumerable,
Both small and great to name them who is able?

And therein thou have made the mighty whale:
There svvims the huge Leuiathan, in straying,
Thy greatness shows, and in his sportiue playing:
Pause.
Avvait on thee, for to refresh their souls:
That thou should give them meat in meetest season,
Which else should want their food, as they want reason.

They gladly take, and thereby they do live:
When once thy hand of bounty is extended,
All good to thy good creatures is expended.

No comfort then, all trouble and annoy:
When thou vvithdravvst their breath life is adiorned,
And to dead dust, is living dust returned.

In forms and seeds they are remade again
And when they fail, with force from thee indevved,
The surface of the old earth is renewed.

From age to age all ages shall record.
And in his works which he in wisdom framed,
He shall rejoice so often as they are named.

Thereof the strength and pillars trembling bovv:
If but to touch the hills, him wrath provoke,
For very fear, the hills with terror smoketh.

Unto that God to sing I will not cease:
Yea while I shall in being be protected,
Unto my God, my Psalms shall be directed.

Shall sweetness to him, to my self impart:
No sorrovv shall from him my solace sever,
My ioying in the Lord shall be for ever.

None wicked be on earth, except entombed
Up, up, my soul to God in thanks be raised,
The worlds great God, of all the world be praised.
Psalm 105. Thanksgiving.
LEt every one of us confessing,
Give thanks to God, his praise expressing:
The glory of his sacred Name,
Among the people all proclaim.
^

His honor great and precious,
Make known his actions glorious.

Declare his vvondrous works abounding.

In his renowned sanctity:
With gladness let the heart and voice
Of them that seek the LORD rejoice.

Ay seek his faces excellency.

The vvondrous works that he has done:
The judgments which pronounced are*
By his own sacred mouth declare.

Gods faithful servants propagation:
Ye Jacobs children his elect,
Whom God as his own does affect.

And judgments are in every place.

He mindful is: remembering ever
The word that he did once command,
To thousand ages firm does stand.

With Abraham fully agreed.
And which by oath he has secured,
Unto his Isaac firm assured.

Established this his decree.
To Israel confirmed fast,
This covenant evermore to last.

The land of Canan to relieve thee.
Of your inheritance the line,
Which I unto you do assign.

But strangers there not known at all.

Having no settled habitation:
From place to place, now here, now there,
They safe by him conducted were.

But scourged great Princes for their sake.

Nor harm the Prophets I appointed.

And there the staff of bread he brake.

Before his own a man he sent.
This Joseph they did sell ungrateful,
To servitude and bondage hateful.

The irons sharp his soul did vvound:

Gods Word assigned for the same.
So when the Lord enough had tried
His faith and patience, testified.

To free him from imprisonment.
Who did the people rule and guide,
For his enlargement did provide.

Lord of his household constituted:
And over his possessions all,
Made him the ruler general.

And teach his Elders policy.
Pause.
And long time in that land soiorned.
In Chams land Jacob did abide,

And in short time made them more strong,
Then they that them had hated long.

Their hearts, from love to hate them changed:
^

That they might exercise their hate
Against his people obstinate:
Who many mischiefs did invent
Against his servants innocent.

He sent with Aaron his elected:

Who manifestly shevv'd to those,
Among them all, his signs of fame,
And wonders in the land of Cham.

They darkness palpable endured:
Against his Word unto them sent,
Were they not disobedient.

And slew their fishes in the flood.
Pause.
Annoyd with stinks abominable:
In presence chambers of their Kings,
He said the word, and on them brings

Throughout their land dust turned to lice.

And on their land, fire flames he shovvred.

And all that in their borders grevv.

Grasshoppers numberles did fall.


Of all their strength with deadly vvound
He struck, and them did quite confound.

With store of gold and silver fraught.
Among their troops, the strong were many,
But sick or feeble were not any.

When from their land they passage had:
For fear and avv of them did fall
Upon The Egyptian dvvellers all.
Pause.
That them from heat the shade might cover:
A flame of fire he set for light,
To guide his Israel by night.

He dainty quails gave them for meat.
With bread from heaven he them relieved,

He from the Rock made rivers flow
In deserts dry, large streams did go.

To Abraham his servant true.

And safe conducted his elected:
Rejoicing with triumphant shovvt.

And gave them their possessions,
The labors of the Nations.

Might duly keep with hearts unfeigned,
His precepts strictly to observe,
And never from his laws to svverue:
Then let us solemnly alvvaies,
The Eternal mighty Lord God praise.
Psalm 106. Comfort.
PRaise ye the Lord, to him confess,
Give thanks to God for his goodness:
For his svveet mercy lasts ever,

Or show his praise which cease never,
Or vvorthily his acts recite?

^re just, who vvalks in upright vvayes.

^

To thy elect remember me,
And as thou safely them defendest.
So let me Lord protected be.

Which thou bestovvest upon thine:
That of thy mercies boundles measure,
With thy elect I may partake,
And with thy heritage in pleasure,
And glorious state, may merry make.

Have sinned and offended thee:
An unjust perverse generation,
Committing wickedness and sin.

In Egypt what thy works have bin.
Our fathers minded not aright
Thy mercies great, thy vvondrous might,
But frovvardly themselves behaved,
Rebelling at the red sea deep.

To show his povvr, them safe did keep.

In haste away the waters hy'd:
Through gulf of waters deep divided,
They passed safe as on dry land,
As through the desert he them guided,

Pause. From cruel forces of their foe,
Pursuing them to overthrow:
He set them free, and them relieved,


And sang his praise, whose help they found.

For his advice they vvaited not:
His counsel just no time attending.

In The wilderness the LORD offending,
And tempting him prouokt to ire.

And their request he did fulfill:
But leanenes sent, their souls consumed,

And to rebel against him presumed,
Nor holy Aaron would abide.

And proved Abiram with his povvr.

And all the wicked therein burnd.

And to adore that idol turned.
Pause.
Unto an Ox that eats gras:
Like brutish beasts was their behauior,

The Lord their God and mighty Savior,
His works in Egypt they forgot.

Which all the land of Cham did fright:
And dreadful povvr which he declared,
At the red sea in all their sight.

Resolved to consume them quite:
But Moses his elect did see,
What danger this to them might be:
Himself betvveen he interposed,
Gods anger fierce to turn away,
Lest he to ruin them disposed,
Them all should in his fury slay.

Which unto them he had ordaind:
^

Upon his Word, no trust they builded,

Obedience none to him they yielded,
Nor hearkened to his word divine.
Pause.
Them to destroy in desert land:
An oath he made, there to destroy them.

Among the heathen to annoy them,
And scatter them in lands vnknovvn.

Themselves with them they did conioyne:
Eating dead Idols sacrifices,

Who for their wicked enterprises,
With grievous sore plagues them reprou'd,

Their wickedness, and them he slew:
When judgment he had executed,
Gods wrath appeased, the plague did cease,

To him alvvay for righteousness.

At Meriba to burn like fire:

That doubting what he enterpris'd,
Displeased his God (in mind perplexed)
With words impatient, vnaduis'd.
Pause.
The Gentiles chase out of their land:

^^ey mixed themselves, and learnd their lore:

Which they did wickedly adore.

Their sons and daughters young were slain:
They sacrificed their sons and daughters

To Canaan idols diu'lish slaughters,
They sacrificed blood innocent.
Such mutders they did execute,
With blood the land they did pollute.

Which they did practice and invent,
Bevvitching Idols them beguiled,
A whoring after them they went,

Against the people he had loved:
That his inheritance he hated*

Under the heathen subiugated,
Whose ravenous hands of them made spoil.
Pause.
Set over them their rulers were:

But they prouok't him wickedly,
With their own counsel: they were ever
Brought lovv for their iniquity.

To their distres, and heard their cry:
And in compassion he relented,

Of their affliction he repented,
According to his mercy great.

Of them that did them captive take:

And save us by thy holy Name,
Thy people from the heathen gather,
That they may magnify thy Fame.

Eternally his praise expres:
Extol his honor, ceasing never,
Let all the people joyful say,
Amen let it be so forever,
The Lord our God praise we alvvay.
Psalm 107. Doctrine.

Give thanks to God, confessing
His goodness, give him praise,
Us with his mercies blessing,

Whom God to save decreed,
How from their cruel foe,

From North lands, and from East,
Together them did gather,
from South sea, and from West,

and wander solitary,
Whereas they found no way,
nor City where to tarry.

In wants they did remain,
Their souls were sore perplexed,
Their hearts did faint with pain.

they cried to God repenting,
Who heard them, and did free
Them from grief and tormenting.

And set them in right way,
To Cities did conduct them,

The hungry he supplied

Whom deaths shade does inuiron,
Bound in afflictions pit,

His counsel they relected,
whose wisdom is most high.

VVhervvith their hearts he humbled,
To help them, none was found,
When they fell down or stumbled.

From deaths shade dark obscured,
Their bonds in sunder brake,

And freed them with vvonder,
That they from thence might pas,
Iron bars he cut in sunder.

No delicates can please them,
Approaching to deaths door,
From whence none can release them.

They cry in time of need,
From troubles all them paining,

Which them did free and save,

Pause. ^


And down the seas descend,
In waters great not failing,

Within the deeps contained,
Whose works so vvondrous be,

The storms strait up arise.
The vvaue so lofty stands,
it seems to threat the skies.

Strait headlong down are tumbled:
Their lives seem to be lost,
their fainting souls are humbled*

Like him that is in drink,
Without wit, sense, or feeling,
Their spirits down do sink.

Their great distres lamenting,
He hears them from on high,
And saues them, death preventing.

He makes them calm and still,
The lofty waves he lays,
and they obey his will.

With joy they are revived,
At their wished haven in peace,

Which large reuenevv yields.

Psalm 108. Prayer.
O God my heart is firm prepared,
In Psalms thy praise shall be declared:
My glory sing his worthy praise,
My Lute, my Harp, your selves vpraise.

Right early I this task will take,
With heart and hand, my voice concenting,
Betimes in the morning, day preventing.
^


Among the people, I Will relate
With my whole hearts affections,
Thy praise among the nations.

Thy mercy and thy verity,
Above the heavens most high ascends,
Above the cloudy sky extends.

Thy glory ore the earth and sky.

With thy right hand, and answer me.

In holiness I will be glad:
Dividing Shechem at my pleasure,
The vale of Succoth I will measure.

As my possession I account:
Manassa rich, that wealth of thine,
Without all doubt becomes mine.
To me does Ephraim belong,
The chief part of my army strong,
And I the kingdom will deliver
To royal Judah my Lavv-giuer.

For servile base employments fit,
As they deserve, such is their lot,
Under my feet to vvash my pot.
And as for Edom this I Will do,
I over it will cast my shoe:
Ore Palestina that proud nation,
I will triumph with exultation.

Into the city builded strong,
For sure defense, where I may bide?
Who into Edom will me guide?

Who us thy people did reject,
And thou O God would not instruct us,
Nor lead our armies, nor conduct us.

Against those who would us oppres:
Save us, for there is none that can
On earth, vain is the help of man.

Against all those that us assail:
And he will by his mighty power
Tread down them who would us devour*
Psalm 109. Prayer.
O Lord God of my praise and glory,
From me in silence do not tarry.

Against me untruths multiplying:
Their mouths deceitful now s^ cope,
Me falsely to condemn they hope.

With war pernicious to confound me,

Their hate against me they have shovved:
But I to pray, my self addressed,
For succor causelessly distressed.

My love to them their hate excited.

Shall therefore over him have power:
His enemy shall ready stand,
Perniciously at his right hand.

As guilty he shall be removed:
When he his prayr shall have erected,
With shame it shall return rejected.

Another shall his office take.
Pause. ^


His vviddovv evermore distressed,

And vvandring lurk in streets forsaken,
In secret beg from gate to gate,
And lurk in corners desolate.

His toils be spoils by robbers shared.

In mercy no man shall him cherish:
Nor shall there any for his sake,
On his poor Orphans pity take.
Pause.
Shall suffer utter extirpation:
And in the age that next does follovv,
Oblivion shall his black name svvollovv.

Of his fathers iniquity.
Forgetfulness shall never smother
The vvickednesses of his mother.

They shall be odious to him ever.
He shall them put to endless shame,
From earth shall cut their hateful name.

Nor minded poor men's tribulation:
But on the needy which did languish,
Perplexed in extremest anguish:
His fury he did execute,
Their life to death did persecute.

With curses he shall be requited;
He blessing hated, never loved,
From him shall blessing be removed.

As with a garment, clothed he has.
Into his belly, like to water,
Throughout his bowels it shall scatter.

Like corsiue oil them macerating:
As garments gi^t about his waste,
Close to him alvvaies sticking fast,

The Lord will have them thus revvarded:
He will confound them that annoy me,
Whose slandrous tongs seek to destroy me:
But thou O Lord for thy Names sake,
Be good to me, some pity take.
Pause.
Of thy great mercy me deliver.

My heart is vvounded and distressed.

At even when light does cease to shine.
From place to place, tossed I betake me.
Leap like a locust they do make me.

My flesh away from bones is vvasting*
My joints all fleshles, naked are,
And all my body lean and bare.

Their scoffs to bear, I am inured:
Beholding me in anguish painful,
At me they shake their heads disdainful.

In mercy let me saved be.

That thou did set thy hand unto it:
We this deliverance had not gained,
If thy might had not us sustained.

That thou do bles us, let them know.
When they arise with rage inflamed,
Cast thou them down, abasht, ashamed,
Thy servant raise with joy abounding,

By themselves let them covered be,
As with a cloak of infamy.

In great assemblies I will bles thee,
I Will praise thee for thy excellency,

VVilt aid the poor, him save from them
Which wickedly his soul condem.
Psalm 110. Doctrine and prophecy.
^

THe mighty Lord, unto my Lord declared
His sacred mind, to him these words he spoke:
At my right hand take thou thy seat prepared,
Until thy foes thy footstool I shall make.

Shall send the rod, and scepter of thy might:
And thou shall rule with soueraign povvr supernall,
Amids thy foes amazed at thy sight.

Shall run when thou with sacred povvr art cround,
As morning dew, drops so innumerable,
To thee the youth of thy womb shall abound.

Who nere repents, has svvorn great Prince to thee,
A Priest thou art Melchisdec like forever,
Thou shall of that eternal order be.

Shall thee assist, and all thy foes confound
In dreadful day of his fierce indignation,
Proud Princes heads shall break, and Kings shall vvound.

Shall fill the fields and streets with bodies dead
Of Monarchs great, imperious tyrannising,
That ruled far and vvide, shall vvound the head*

He of the brook shall drink in speedy way:
Therefore shall he exalt his head high raised,
Victoriously triumph and reign for ay.
Psalm 111. Praise and Thanksgiving.
^

TO God the Lord I will confess,
With all my heart him praise and bles,
Among the righteous congregation,
His benefits I will relate,
With thanks his glory celebrate,
And of his praise make declaration.

By every one they out are sought,
In them who true delight obtains.

His justice and benignity,
To all eternity remains.

He everlasting fame has vvon:
He gracious is, full of compassions,

His covenant he in mind will bear,
For ay throughout all generations.
Pause.
His actions full of povvr and might,
The heathens lands unto them giving.

And faithful are all his commands,
To his in due obedience living.

For evermore they shall endure,
In truth and righteousness ordained.

To keep his covenant he is bent,
At his command it ay remained.
Most holy ever is his Name,
Most reu'rend also is the same:

Of saving knowledge sure are they,
That his commandments do obey,
His praise eternally remains.
Psalm 112. Consolation.
^

THe man is blessed, the Lord who fears,
And to his Law affection bears.

Shall mighty be, as Princes reigning:
The just and righteous generation,
Shall ever be a blessed Nation.

His righteousness ever remains.

Clear light to him betimes arises:
He gracious is, full of compassion,
And righteous in his conversation.

Iudiciously his words expendeth:
In all affairs he does indeuer,
With just discretion to persevere.

His memory shall last for ever.

He does not harbor fickle humors:
His heart is fixed what ere betideth,
His faithful trust in God abides.

He sees his foe to ruin slideth.

Dispersing to the poor and needy:
To all his justice never cease,
To do all good, himself addresseth:
The strength and honor he possesses,
Shall be exalted, still increases.

And seeing this, shall be perplexed:
Gnashing his teeth in rage and ier,
Shall melt avaay as fat in fire:
His hope is crossed, and lost his hyer,
He perish shall, and his desire.
Psalm 113. Praise.
^

PRaise ye the Lord his servants all*
The Name of God right blessed call:
His Name to praise, let all endeuer,

His glorious Name to celebrate,
And magnify both now and ever.

His honor make we manifest:
The Name of God the Lord be praised,

Exalted far above the sky,
Above heaven is his glory raised.

He only is Lord paramount:
Who to his Throne most high ascends,

All matters there to see and know,
To rule and guide, he down descends.

He raises up to honors high:
The needy from filth foul defaced,

To sit with Nobles he them makes,
Among his peoples Princes placed.

Is changed to fertility:
Dead hopes by him to life are raised,
He makes the barren to conceive
With children, mothers joy receive,
The Lord our God be ever praised.
Psalm 114. Thanksguing.
^

WHen Israel from out of Egypt went,
And Jacobs house from people strange were sent,
From cruel thrall secured:

He Israel for his dominion had,
Unto himself procured.

And Iordans flood did backwards take his flight:
To turn his streams constraining.

And little hills did skip it like the lambs,
In fearful plight remaining.

What ayled thee thou Jordan taking flight,
To turn thy streams constraining?

Ye little hills why did ye skip like lambs,
In fearful plight remaining?

Of Jacobs God, thou earth with all thy coasts,
Quake, shake, ye frighted mountains.

Hard stones to streams, and from the flint does make
To flow fresh floods and fountains.
Psalm 115. Prayer.
^

NOt to us Lord, not to us we entreat,
But to thy Name give thou the glory great:
For thy truth and thy fauer:

VVher's now your God^ why does he not appear,
Where Is now your trust, your Sauer?

There he does rule above, and here below:
He does what ere he wills,

Of silver framed, or at the best of gold,
As hand of workman skilleth.

And eyes they have, but never see the light:
No life in them remains,

They smell not though their nostrils do appear,
Their bulk no sense contains.

They never walk with feet whereon they stand:
Their throat nor sings nor cries,

As senseles sots are they, who do them make,
And who in them affyeth.
Pause.
In God, thy aid, thy shield, and thy defense:
From perils he will ward thee.

In God thy aid, thy shield and thy defense,
From dangers he will guard thee.

And trust in him your helper, your defense,
He is your sure salvation.

He Israel for evermore will bles,
And Aarons generation.

Both young and old, the greater with the les,
Shall high be dignified.

Both unto you and your posterity,
Shall still be multiplied.

Who heaven and earth has made, which do declare
His povvrfull operation.

And all the earth, with all therein has given,
To Adams generation.

By those who in the silent grave go down,
Thy honor is not raised.

And we will praise thee ever more and more,
Therefore the Lord be praised.
Psalm 116. Thanksgiving.
^

I Love the Lord, because he ear does give,
Unto my voice, and to my supplication,

Therefore will I call on him while I live.

With grievous pangs afflicted, I did languish:
Near to the grave in doleful grief and anguish,
I on the Lords Name called and cried out.

Then did I find the Lord most just and gracious,


Cast down with grief, I was brought very lovv,
He raised me up in safety me enclosing,

For God on thee does freely gifts bestovv.

My eyes from tears, my slippry feet from sliding,

Into the land of life through paths of peace.
Pause.
In my distres afflicted and tormented:

That liars all men are, vain is their aid.

His bounty to me? what gratification?

And thankfully on Gods Name I will call.

In presence of his people all redeemed,

Most precious in his sight it is alvvay.

Thy handmaids son, to serve thee ay addressed,
In sorrovvs straits when I was sore distressed,
Thou did release me, all my bonds vnty.

And call upon thy Name with adoration,

Now unto thee will I my vows fulfill.

The praises of his Name with glory crowned,
In midst of thee Jerusalem renowned,
Praise ye the Lord, to him a^ thankful be.
Psalm Cxvij.
^

ALl Nations laud the Lord our God,
Praise him all people all abroad.

Has he exceeded tovvard us:
His truth abides eternally,
Him therefore ever magnify.
Psalm 118. Thanksgiving and prophecy.
^

TO God give thanks, all praises render,
Because so gracious good is he,
For his compassion, mercy tender,
Endures sure eternally.

And singing publish solemnly.
That his so great commiseration,
Most sure endures perpetually.

Now say, declaring publicly,
That his great bounty and compassion*
Endures sure continually.

Does fear and serve God faithfully,
Now say his mercies ay persevere,
Enduring everlastingly.

I called on him earnestly:
He ansvverd me, my wrongs redressed,
From thrall at large he set me free.

Both heaven and earth, stands firm for me,
Me safe defending while he stands,
I need not fear man's enmity;
Pause.
The Lord for me stands steadfastly,
What I to see have much desired,
My foes before my face shall flee.

In God, then in man's amity:

For frail earths greatest Princes be.

Me have besieged perniciously:
In Gods Name with his aid abounding,
I shall destroy them utterly.

On every side maliciously:
But in the Name of God reposing,
I will destroy them totally.

Their vvings were singed instantly,
In Gods Name I at all points armed,
Shall them destroy undoubtedly.

That I might fall down suddenly:
At me with all thy povvr have pushed,
But God did help me certainly.

Of him will I sing cheerfully:
He is my refuge and my tovver,
He keeps me safe assuredly.

Is heard to sound most joyfully
Within the righteous habitation,
The Lords right hand does valiantly.
Pause.
Exalted in most high degree:
The Lords right hand is dignified,
His works are wrought most povvrfully.

I shall not die, but live to see
^

Gods works declared and testified,
My self will show them openly.

I must confess deservedly,
To my instruction exercised,
Not to destruction finally:

That entering in humility,
I to the LORD GOD, who most just is,
May render praises thankfully.

Is God's the Lord of sanctity,
The righteous in his sight respected,
Shall enter therein peacefully,

Thou gave me answer graciously:
For thy salvation I will bles thee,
And for thy great benignity.
Pause.
Refusing it disdainfully,
Is now the chief and choice selected,
Adorns the corner gracefully.

He did it most apparently:
He that works wonders, he has wrought it,
In our sight it shovvs maruelously.

Let us enjoy it holily,
Since he with brightness has arayd it,
Therein rejoice we merrily.

From dangers and adversity,
Of good succes thou art the giver,
O send us now prosperity.

We bid him vvelcome heartily*
Out of Gods house to you addressed,
From him we bles you willingly.

He has given us light plenteously:
Bring offerings, them with cords fast binding,
To th'Altars horns abundantly.

I will give thanks and praise to thee:
My God I will exalt and bles thee,
With voice and hearts integrity,

Because so gracious, good is he:
For his compassion, m^^cy tender,
Endures sure eternally.
Psalm 119.
1. Aleph, Consolation.
ALl they are blessed, who keep the perfect way,
Of upright life, and spotles conversation,
Who in the law of God do walk alvvay:

Do truly keep his statutes constantly.
And seek him with their whole hearts application
And they which do not work iniquity,
But vvalking in the vvayes of God, perfeuer,
Alvvay therein persisting steadfastly:

To keep thy laws, thy precepts to fulfill,
With diligence and prudent strictnes ever
Ah that I might by thee be guided still,
That all my vvayes might alvvayes be directed
To keep thy ^ests, and to observe thy will.

Having regard to thy Commandments all,
When in my heart I have them most respected.
An upright heart in me on thee shall call.
By me thy praise with thanks shall be expressed,
^

When judgments thine most righteous learn I shall,

Thus I intend, but when I fail or fall,
O leave me not quite when I am distressed:
2 BETH
BY what means might a young man (prone to ill)
His vvayes reform^ by taking heed persevere,
Him to conform unto thy Word and will.

O let me not from thy Commandments stray,
And from thy paths O let me wander never.
Before my eyes, and in my heart I lay
Thy sacred Word, as my most precious treasure,
Lest I offend thee, guide me in thy way.

Do thou vouchsafe me in thy laws to teach,
That I may know and do thy will and pleasure.
Betimes my lips have published and do preach
The judgments of thy mouth most venerable,
Whose equity and right to all does reach.

Unto my soul, then all the worlds rich store,
Thy way to walk, is wealth inualuable.
Bearing in mind thy precepts evermore,
On them shall be my serious meditation;
Thy sacred vvayes respecting more and more.

I will not be unmindful of thy lore,
Nor of thy Word forget the observation.
3. GIMEL.
Confer on me thy servant saving grace,
Deal bounteously with me, my state sustaining,
That I may line still thy word to embrace.

Open thou ^^me eyes that I may clearly see
The vvonder^ ^^ ^hy Law, thy will containing.
Conduct me in the way, O guide thou me,
A stranger here on earth to heaven aspiring,
From me let not thy law concealed be.

To them alvvay so fervent is my love,
My longing soul does languish them desiring.
Consuming quite the proud, thou do reprove
Them with thy curse against thee who rebelled,
Who erring from thy precepts far remove.

From me auert contempt and infamy,
For I to keep thy word my self compelled.
Conspiring Princes sat accusing me,
While I thy servant all my meditations
Did bend upon the Statutes made by thee.

All my delight thy testimonies be
My counselors in all my consultations:
4. DALETH.
Dejected lovv, my soul cleaues to the dust,
Such grievous vvoe does ouercom and quail me,
O quicken me, for on thy word I trust.

But did me hear when I to thee did pray,
Thy Statutes teach me for they most auail me,
Direct my mind to understand the way
Of thy decrees, and my communication
Shall be of all thy vvondrous works alvvay.

According to thy promise me relieve,
My drooping soul raise up with consolation.
Divert me from that way which does deceive,
Let me be of thy sacred law possessed,
Which gracious gift, let me of th^^ receive,

To walk therein before me I have placed
Thy judgments just, which be for ever blessed.
Devoted to thy Precepts I stick fast,
To them I cleave firm fixed and unmoved,
Lord therefore let me never be disgraced,

And with thy Word it more enlarged have,
I Will run the way of thy Decrees approved,
5 HE
Eternal Lord, to me the knowledge send,
Of thy Edicts, teach me thy statutes solely,
That I may keep thy Word unto the end,

That I may keep it without doubt or dread,
It to observe, applying my heart wholy.
Even in the paths of thy Edicts to tread,
Guide thou my steps to follovv thy direction,
For I delight to go where thou do lead,

Unto thy laws do thou my heart incline,
Expel from me all covetous infection.
Eyes vvandrers are, turn thou these eyes of mine
From vanity, that they be not allured,
Grown dull, revive me in that way of thine,

To me, who am thy servant, unto thee,
And to thy fear, devoted and inured.
Expel thou far this my reproach from me,
And turn away the shame that I have feared,
For just are all thy judgments known to be.

For thy Commands do, I seek earnes^y,
And let my heart by justice thine be ch^ared.
6 VAV
FVlfill to me thy gracious promise Lord,
Salvation thine shovv, and thy mercy tender,
Accordingly as thou have said the word,

Who me reproach and mock, because I make
Thy Word my trust, who art my sole defender.
From out my mouth, thy true Word do not take,
For judgment thine is my hopes expectation,
The word of truth, O let me not forsake,

For evermore, and to perpetual ay,
I to thy law will yield all observation.
Fair, large, and vvide, shall be my spacious way,
At liberty, where I shall still be vvalking,
Because I have thy Precepts sought alvvay.

In presence of both Noble, Prince and King,
Not bashfully their honored mention balking.
Fulness of joy thy Law to me does bring,
There in have I my hearts affection placed,
From it to me all true delight does spring,

For with thy word, whose worthy praise I Will sing,
My study and my voice shall still be graced.
7 ZAIN.
GRant I may prove, that thou the Word do mind,
Which thou to me thy servant have declared,
And which thou madst me vvait and hope to find.

Thy gracious Word has me revived again,
For me by thee this comfort is prepared.
Great men in pride, with all their scornful train,
With scoffs and mocks, thy servant have disdained,
Yet I to keep thy Law, did not refrain.

Which unto us remained have of old,
With comfort great, I have my heart sustained.
Grief, horror fear upon me yet take hold,
When I behold the wicked, who despised
Thy gracious Law, which to them has bin told.

Have bin my songs, mirth, music unto me,
My pilgrimage in them I exercised.
Good gracious Lord I still remembered thee,
And thy great Name at midnight I have blessed,
I did observe thy Statutes vvatchfully.

To keep it still for ever this I see
Redounds to me, of favor thine possessed.
8. HETH.
How ever men for wealth have toild and wrought,
O Lord thou art the portion I obtained,
I vovv to keep the word that thou have taught.

According to thy word and promise made
Let thy free grace of me be freely gained.
Having in mind well vvay'd my vvayes and trade,
And what estate I stand in searched and tried,
My course I turned, and thy Laws I obeyed.

To please thee best, and practice thy commands,
Without delay in hasty speed I ^yed.
Harmles unarmed me armed troops and bands
Of wicked men have spoiled, of goods deprived,
Yet in my mind thy law still firmly stands.

At midnight will arise for to praise thee,
And give thee thanks by whom I have suruiued.
His faithful friend I am what ere he be
Who fears thee, and thy behests observes,
I take delight in all such company.

Does fill the earth: in thy law teach thou me,
For me from sin such knowledge safe preserves,
9. TETH.
In dealing with thy servant gracious Lord
Thy goodness great thou faithfully have shevved,
Thou have performed according to thy word.

With knowledge true, and understanding right,
For I thy law beleiu'd, and sin eschevved.
I went astray all day till darksome night
Of my distress so heavy on me lighte^,
But now I keep thy word restored to light,

As thou art good, so thou all glorious art,
Teach me thy law, make me therein clear sighted.
Informers proud and false have played their part,
Against me lies and forged tales inuenting,
Thy precepts I do keep with all my heart.

Their heart is gross and fat, they vvanton grow,
I in thy law delight, my self contenting.
It Is good for me that I was troubled so,
Afflicted and distressed in such great measure,
Thy Statutes I the better learn to know.

The law of thy mouth me more good does do.
Much more beloved incomparable treasure.
10. IOD.
Knit are my joints together by thy hand,
Thou have in this proportion me composed,
Make me thy law to learn and understand.

When they shall see that I thy grace obtain
Because I in thy word my hope reposed.
Known is it, Lord, thy judgments just remain,
I know it: thou have justly me afflicted,
Thy faithfulness therein appears plain.

O let thy grace and mercy comfort send,
As promise me thou did to thee addicted.
Kind mercies thine in love to me extend,
That I may live still in thy law delighting,
Which is my joy, and shall be without end.

For meditate do I continually
On thy Decrees, their exercise exciting.
Kindle their love, and let them ioyn with me
Who fear thee, and have known thy law proclaimed,
For I delight in their society.

Make me observe thy statutes perfectly,
That ever sound, I nere be found ashamed*
11 CAPH.
LOng time I vvait, still longing for thy Word,
My heart, my soul does faint, for thy salvation,
For only it can me relief afford.

My eyes fail, for thy Word some comfort daign,
O when vvilt thou grant me thy consolation.
Like bottles scorcht in smoke, dried I remain,
With brinish tears, my vvrinckled cheeks polluted,
Yet fresh in mind, thy laws I still retain.

For serving thee? when shall thy judgment be
On my foes, me pursuing, executed.
Lo how deep pits the proud have dig'd for me,
In their corrupt proceedings, quite contrary
To thy just laws in them opposing thee.

My foes without cause* persecute me still,
Me to assist, delay not long, nor tarry.
Life precious is, my life who sought to spill,
Had me on earth consumed, almost destroying,
Yet ceast I not thy Precepts to fulfill.

The testament of thy own mouth I will
Observe and keep, my life therein employing.
12 LAMED
MOst mighty Lord in heaven vvher thou do reign,
Is settled sure, the word of thy salvation,
For ever there enthroned it does remain.

Thy faithfulness endures, the earth shall stand,
Which thou have set upon a sure foundation.
Maintained still by thy Almighty hand,
They do abide as thou have them ordained,
Thy servants are they still at thy command.

In my distres I then had perished quite,
My joy in thy Word has my life sustained.
My mind thy Laws all which are just and ^ight,
Shall nere forget within my soul ingraued,
By them thou have restored my life and light.

O save thou me, for I am only thine,
For I have sought thy Precepts, them I craved.
Malicious men, this harmles life of mine
Have vvayted long and sought to have destroyed,
Whilst I think on thy sacred word divine.

That to an end, perfections all decline,
Thy perfect Law most large is aye inioyed.
13 MEM
NO time I cease, even throughout all the day,
To meditate thy Law most dear beloved,
O how I love thy gracious Word alvvay:

Then are my foes, with me it is at hand,
And evermore abides unremoved.
Now more I know, and much more understand
Of wisdoms lore, then all they that have taught me,
For I muse on those Laws thou did command.

Then those that are my elders, more I know,
Because to keep thy precepts thou have wrought me.
No wicked way I went, not will I go,
From all such paths I have my feet refrained,
That I might keep the word which thou did shovv.

I nere forsook thy judgments just and meet,
For wisdom I have by thy doctrine gained.
No taste is to my palate half so svveet,
Not honey pure within my mouth received,
As when thy words with grace me kindly greet.

Therefore I hate all false vvayes, keep my feet
From them far off, since I the true perceived.
14. NVN.
Only thy word, which is a lamp of light,
Does guide my steps and gives my feet direction,
It shows my way before me shining bright.

Unto thy laws, to keep and to obey
The judgment of thy justice in perfection:
O Lord I am afflicted night and day,
Do thou revive me, to thy grace restore me
According to thy word as thou did say.

Accept my vows and all my offerings free,
Thy judgments teach me, set them all before me.
Often is my soul, nay even continually,
As in my hands with dangers dread dismayed,
Yet is thy Law no whit forgot byme.

Yet from thy just commands thou did decree,
Nor from thy vvayes most straight I have not strayed,
Of all those Laws and precepts given by thee
I am as of my heritage possessed,
My hearts delight and my chief joys they be,

Still to perform to perpetuity
Thy statutes all and testimonies blessed.
15. SAMECH.
Presumptuous vain inventions I do hate,
And sickle minds inconstantly that waver,
Thy law I love, with praise I celebrate.

Upon thy word my hope, my trust does stay,
For which I vvait, and for thy gracious fauer.
Part hence far off from me all ye alvvay
Who justly for your wicked deeds are blamed,
That I the laws of my God might obey.

Whereto I trust, do thou my life maintain,
O frustrate not my hope lest I be shamed.
Perform this my request, me to sustain,
So saved shall I be, by thee protected,
And in thy Laws my joys will ay remain.

Down underfoot all such thou trampled have
For their deceit and falsehood foul detected.
Perpetually to cease, like dross to waste,
The wicked on the earth thy justice makes,
Therefore upon thy word my love is plac t.

When judgments thine the wicked down do cast,
Thy terrors, fear, and dread, hold on me takes,
16. AIN.
Quarrels unjust I quench and quiet make,
With judgment I have Justice executed,
Q^ite leave me not to foes, nor me forsake.

Who me accuse, let my good cause prevail,
That by proud men I be not persecuted.
Quite weakened is my sight, my eyes do fail
With longing looks expecting thy salvation,
And for thy words most just which me auail.

According to thy mercy with me deal,
And of thy law teach me the observation.
Quick judgment and true understanding zeal
Give me who serve thee at thy hand attending,
The knowledge of thy will to me reueal.

Almighty Lord thy law they overthrow,
To abrogate it utterly contending,
Quintestence of all wealth on earth below,
Yea pure fine gold I hold unfit compared
Unto thy Laws, my love esteems them so.

But all false vvayes which sinners daily go
I do abhor, and have my hate declared.
17. PE,
Remarkable and most strange wonders are
Within thy Laws and cou^nants comprehended
Therefore to keep them is my souls chief care.

It gives to the simple glorious light,
And knowledge by it is to them extended.
Right vvide I set my mouth that so I might
My panting breath dravv in to thee aspiring,
For in thy Law is all my souls delight.

As thou were wont to them that love thy Name,
Thy custom still to deal so thee requiring.
Reduce my steps that I my course may frame
By thy Decrees, and therein be directed,
And let no sin rule ore me to my shame.

And I will keep thy Statutes most divine,
Observing all thy Laws, which I affected.
Resplendent rays of thy face make to shine
On me by whom thou joyfully art served,
Teach thou to me those sacred Laws of thine.

Large streams of tears run down these eyes of mine
Because thy laws are not by them observed.
18. ZADE.
Sole suprem Lord eternal and most just
Thy judgments all which righteous are revealing,
Thy justice we acknovvledge perfect must.

Thou straightly bidst us practice and make known,
Thy faithfulness not faithlesly concealing.
Suppressed by my zeal I am cast down
Because that they who often have me distressed,
Thy word out of their mind have quite forgon.

Most perfect pure, of love entire thereto
And joy therein thy servant is possessed.
Small is my state, I little am and lovv,
Of lofty great ones I am but despised,
Yet from my mind thy law I let not go.

Thy justice is and shall be evermore.
And thy Law is the Truth most highly prised.
Sad sorrovv and distress do vex me sore,
Have found me out, and finding captive take me,
Yet still thy Hests delight me more and more.

For ever just are all thy Laws and lore,
That I may live to understand them make me.
19. KOPH.
Thee have I called upon with my whole heart,
Vouchsafe O LORD an answer soon to give me,
Thy statutes I will keep, from them nere part.

Preserve me safe, and then observe will I
Thy precepts lust, O save thou and relieve me.
The early day preventing, I did cry
To thee, my hope upon thy word depended,
My trust upon thy promise does rely.

To meditate upon thy holy word,
To exercise therein I have intended.
Thy gracious ear in mercy me afford.
Revive thou me, restore my life decayed,
According to thy custom, gracious Lord.

Thou see and knovvst them given to wickedness,
And how far from thy doctrine they have strayed.
Thou Lord art near to help in all distres,
And on firm truth all thy commands are grounded,
And thou have them ordaind in righteousness.

Of thy Decrees years shall be numberles,
For evermore to last thou have them founded,
20. RESH:
Vexations of my heart do thou behold,
Free me, for I thy law have not neglected,
But steadfastly in mind I do it hold,

O save me by thy sacred word alone,
Revive thou me and let me be erected.
Vain is the way that wicked men have gone
From safety far off, far from their salvation
Because of thy just Statutes they keep none.

Are manifold, O Lord, and very great,
Revive me by thy Judgments declaration.
Ungodly men, my foes, in vvrathfull heat
Are many, strong, still seeking to confound me,
Yet from thy vvayes my steps I do not set.

Their sins against thee I with grief behold,
Because thy law they keep not, vvoe does vvound me.
Vie^, Lord, my love, how I myself unfold
Unto thy law, most vvorthily beloved,
Re^iue me by thy mercies manifold.

Thy Judgments just eternally entold,
Do all endure for evermore unmoved.
21. SCHIN.
Without a cause though Princes hatred bear
Against me, whom they cruelly pursued,
Yet still my heart of thy law stands in fear.

Then they who with great spoils enriched be,
Thy Sayings have my joys much more renewed.
Who lying use, most odious are to me,
Deceit and fraud abhorring I have hated,
But dearly love the laws ordained by thee.

For Judgments thine most righteous and thy grace
Thy Name to laud my lays are consecrated.
Who love thy law and thy word do embrace
Are blessed with great peace by them enjoyed,
And no affront shall their content deface.

Lord, I for thy salvation hope and crave,
Thy Statutes I to do am still employed.
Wholy to keep thy laws my self I gave,
Them to observe I have my self applied,
I love them best, by them thou vvilt me save.
^68 All thy Decrees which thou have testified,
Thy Precepts and thy Statutes kept I have,
For all my vvayes to thee are known and tried.
TAV
Yield me such grace, that my cries may ascend
Before thy face O Lord let them come near thee,
Me by thy Word, true understanding send.

According to thy gracious saving Word,
Deliver me, that I may love and fear thee.
Yield laud my lips shall, and to thee afford
Due thanks and praise, most vvorthily deserved,
When thou thy laws to teach me, shall accord.

For justice all is which thou do command,
Most worthy still in mind to be preserved.
Yield me thy aid, reach me thy helping hand,
For I have of thy Precepts made election,
Which I desire to know and understand.

For I have longd thy saving health to see,
Thy Law delights me, vvins my hearts affection.
Yet let my soul live, that it may praise thee,
And let thy laws which never have decayed,
Be still my aid, and helpful unto me.

Thy servant seek, restored let me be,
For in my heart, thy Word has ever stayed.
Psalm 120. Prayer and Complaint.
WHen sharp afflictions me oppressed,
I to the Lord my prayr addressed:
He heard me when to him I cried,
And me with timely aid supplied.

From lying lips of the deceiuer:
Preserve my life safe from the vvrong
And harm of the deceitful tongue,

Or what exceeding gain comes of it?
How can thou get so great advantage
By this thy soothing smoothing language?
^


As when the strong shoots his sharp arrow:
The vvounds of thy inuenom'd tongue,
Like coals of Juniper, burn long.

To stay in Mesechs tents detained:
O painful long peregrination,
In cruel Kedars habitation.

Which hate to love, love to be chiding:
Embracing strife and enmity,
Abhorring peace and amity.

The more their rage is multiplied.
When I my mind for peace declared,
Then they themselves for war prepared.
Psalm 121. Comfort.
^

UP to the hills I lift mine eyes,
From whence comes help to me.

Whose povvr has made the earth and skies,
He has them surely founded,
On him my hope is grounded.

For he that does thee keep,
Nor slumber will, nor sleep.

With vvatchfull eye him keeps,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps.

The Lord at thy right hand,
Thy shade, thy shield does stand.

Nor Sun nor Moon shall smite thee,
Nor day nor night afright thee.

When thou comst in or out.

Shall by his blessing prosper still,
And all thou do indeuer,
The Lord will bles for ever.
Psalm 122. Consolation.
^

WHen I did hear the peoples voice,
Say, let us go with one accord,
Into the Temple of the Lord,
O how my heart it did rejoice.

Within thy gates where we shall stay,
Jerusalem thou city blessed,

A city of most high esteem,
Within it self, of peace possessed.

There do the tribes of God ascend
To Isreal's ark, where they intend
To give God thanks, his Name to praise.

The thrones of David's house high graced,
Are there established, failing never.

May flourish there, and never ceas^:
Who love thee, they shall prosper ever,

Within thy walls and fortresses,
And in thy royal Palaces
And houses, all prosperity.

Which dvvell in thee, this prayr I make,
Let peace within thee be assured.

For thee will we with one accord,
Seek all the good may be procured.
Psalm 123. Prayer.
^

TO thee O Lord, whose throne is in the skies,
Do I lift up mine eyes:
As servants lo, distressed by disaster,
Have recourse to their Master,
As handmaids on their Mistres hand attending,
So we on God depending,
Attend the Lord, till he most gracious
Have mercy upon us.

Have mercy upon us,
For we are filled with scorn intolerable,
Contempt insufferable.

With bitter scoffs abused,
By the rich at ease, the proud ore us do vant,
Disdainful, arrogant*
Psalm 124. Thanksgiving.
LEt Israel now say* and make it known,
Unless the Lord of hosts had fought for us.

In our defense, when men most furious,
Their forces joined us to have ouerthrovvn,
^


When their fierce wrath in^am'd, thirsting for blood,

Had us orevvhelmd, and sunk us to the ground,
The surging waves and storms our souls had drovvnd.

We had bin lost, and all quite cast away.

Who left us not, nor gave us as a prey
Unto their teeth, who sought our souls to slay.

That secretly the subtle fovvler laid,
The net is broke, and we escaped are:

Our safety is, who heaven and earth has made.
Psalm 125. Doctrine.
^

WHo trust in God, and him rely on,
Reposing confidence
Alone in his defense,
They shall stand sure like to mount Sion,
Unmoved remaining failing never,
But biding ever.

Jerusalem enclose,
The Lord is so to those
That do his will, on him relying,
The Lord will keep him safe assured,
Ever secured.

Not long upon the just*
But he on whom they trust,
Them safe deliverance, speedy daigneth,
Lest they be forced by oppression,
unto transgression.

And who upright abide,

With sinners shall have due damnation,
Let Israel of peace possessed,
Be ever blessed.
Psalm 126. Praise.
^

WHen Sions sad captivity,
The Lord returned to liberty,
Amazed tvvixt sudden joy and fear,
Much like to them that dream, we were.

To songs of joy and laughter turned:
The heathen people were afraid,
God wonders wrought for us, they said.

Great works for us, surpassing thought,
Of all our joys he is the ground,
In him alone our joys abound.

Which yet in thrall long time have mourned:
As streams refresh the parched South,
As welcome shovvrs in time of drouth.

Shall reap in joy, full crops shall movv.

Sovving with tears the precious seed,
Shall home return, all sadness ceasing,
And making merry, joys increasing,
Great store receive, which harvest yields,
Bring vvaighty sheaues, from fertile fields.
Psalm 127. Doctrine.
Unless the Lord the house does build,
The builders cost and care is vain,
Their charge is lost, and all their pain,
^

Though stuff be strong, and men be skilled,
Unless the Lord the city guard,
In vain men vvatch, in vain they ward.

In vain ye go so late to bed,
In vain ye pain both hand and head:
In vain so homely hard ye fare,
Unless God bles wake they or sleep,
Whom he does love, he safe will keep.

With hopeful issue of his own,
His heirs to what he has possessed,
It is the gift of God alone:
God only of his goodness gives
The womb due fruit, that after lives.

Of body strong, and stout of mind,
So apt and active in their kind,
That arrows to the head drawn home,
With strongest arm and nimblest slight,
Seem not more terrible in fight.

His quiver with such shafts as these,
For in the trial of their pleas*
They shall not be abasht nor illd:
Nay, they shall make their foes ashamed
Before the Judge and justly blamed.
Psalm 128. Doctrine.
BLessed is whosoever does fear the Lord of might.
And truly does indeuer to walk his ways aright.

And all things fair befalling thy vvelfare shall be great.

About thy chamber seeming, a fresh and fruitful vine:
Thy children all assembling thy table round about,
Young olive plants resembling that fairly spring and sprout.

To them this is expressed, who worship him aright,

Thou shall see Salems City to flourish evermore.

And Israel possessing peace and prosperity.
Psalm 129. Thanksgiving.
^

Often from my youth now Israel may say,
They have beset me round, and sore assailed,

My overthrow, but never yet prevailed.

Of their despite, delighting in my sorrovvs:
For on the ridg of my bare naked back,
The plovvers plovvd and eared up long furrovvs.

Of wicked men he has cut quite in sunder.

That vvrong his Saints, or would bring Sion under.

On tops of walls, or battlements of towers,
Which vvithers soon, though for a while it shows,
But dryes and dies, or ere it bears flovvers.

He fills not his hand, who so it reapeth,
Nor yet the poor that gleaneth in the field,
Of vvha^ ^s left, his little lapfull heapeth.

Good luck from God, or to them in his Name,
So much as say, God speed your work, God speed ye.

My cries I have addressed, O Lord my God to thee.

And to my supplication, bovv down attentive ear.

To suffer thy dread terrors, O Lord who able is?

Therefore with adoration, thy Name shall feared be*

My hope and faith depends upon his promise just.

Then he whom watching tireth, does look for break of day.

For in him sure salvation, and boundles mercy dvvell,
He dearly does esteem thee O Israel by his grace,
He freely will redeem thee, and all thy sins deface.
Psalm 131. Consolation.

O Lord I have no haughty mind,

Too great for me, too hard, too high.

With humblenes my self demeande,

Of his own mother, mind not me.

Affliction, and calamity.

To Jacobs God vovv'd solemnly.

My house shall never me enclose,
Nor on my bed will I repose.

No slumber shall my eye lids close.

Where Gods Ark may with us remain,
Where we the Lord may entertain,
The God of Jacob and his race,
Whose might does Israel sustain.

From time to time, as we heard say,
It often had bin at Ephrata,
From place to place it often did pas,
In vvoods and fields we found it stay.

Into his palace we will go
Before his footstooll falling lovv.

Thy self and thy Arks strength there shovv.

Let them from thee glad tidings bring,
Let all thy Saints rejoice and sing.

Refuse not thine anointed King.

Who will not change nor turn from it,
To David, saying, I permit
That one of thy posterity
Upon thy throne shall ever sit.

And this my testimonial
Which unto them declare I shall,
Their sons also shall sit for ay
Upon thy Throne imperial.

Of Zion fair which does excel,

Herein I rest, here I rejoice,
For ay this place does like me well,

With all good things they shall abound:

With my salvation there will I
Make all her Saints their joys resound.

The horn of David raised high:
A lamp of light prepared have I
For mine anointed sacred King,
Whose glory I will multiply.

With shame they shall be cloathd all ore,
His glorious state will I restore,
And on his sacred head renovvnd,
His crown shall ^ourish evermore.
Psalm 133. Doctrine.
BEhold* how good, how pleasant, amiable,
And gracious is the love inviolable,
Of brethren which together dvvell.

The sacred oil which Gods law did appoint,
The high Priest Aaron to anoint.
Which plenteously upon his head was poured,
And to his beard and garment skirts down shovvred,

With sweetest scent perfuming all,

On Sion mount, and fertile Hermon hill,
Which all the land with fruit does fill.
Even there the Lord his bounty large expressing,
Will povvr and shovvr his favor, grace and blessing,
And life eternal give he will.

Proud Babels streams with streaming tears augmenting,

With hearts grief pang'd, with floods of plaints oreflovving
Our harps we hang d on vvillovv plants there growing.

Importuned us to sing our joys deprived:
Insulting bid us Sion songs expres.

Our mournful hearts to sing the songs ordained,
To praise our God in strangers land profaned?

All harping skill, if I do not persevere,
Jerusalem thee in my mind to bear.

Nere let me be with any joys endevved,
Until I see thy former joys renewed.

With rage against Jerusalem exclamed,
That dismal day when it quite waste was laid,
Remember how inhumanly they said,
Sack, kill, spoil, burn, turn all to desolation,
Race down to ground, demolish the foundation.

Thrice happy he whose povvr shall be employed,
As thou have us, more vvretched thee to make.

From breasts impure, thy brauling brats, and brain them,
And dash their bones against stones, till they have slain them

O God thou have me searched and tried,
What is in me thou have espied,
And unto thee is thoroughly known,

By thee a far off is perceived.

Still thee I see approaching nigh,

Familiarly them out do scan.

But lo thou Lord knovvst all revealed.

Me round about thy hands infold,
On me set fast thy hand does ly.

Too precious far for me to gain it,
So high that I cannot attain it,

I know not whether I should fly.

If into heaven, there thou vvilt be:
And if into the deep I enter,
Even there I find thee at the center.

At farthest shores where seas do drive
Their utmost waves there to abide,
Or on the morning vvings to ride.

Thy hand me holds, where my foot treads.

In darkness from thee vnespide,

When first the womb did me enclose,
Thou did me cover and compose,

With thankful praises ever bles thee.

How vigorous strong my bones did grow,
When thou in secret did create me,
In place obscure did animate me.
With curious work thou have me wrought,
In earths lovv cells to fashion brought.

A shapeles lump imperfect mas,
Thou made my parts, time, form decreeing,
Writ in thy book before my being.

To me thy counsels do appear?
Of what in estimable prise,
How great, how high the sum does rise?

Rich pearls as sand innumerable.
With thee am I still when I wake,
Thy early counsel I partake:

Let thy strong arm the wicked kill.
Therefore you bloody men I banish,
For ever from my presence vanish.

Who speak against thee blasphemies:

Do I not them all execrate,
Against thee who do rise contrary,
Do I not count my adversary?

Am with them ever at debate,
And them account my mortal foes.

Of my heart search each cogitation,
Try me by strict examination.
Of all my thoughts the trial take,
And of my heart, experience make.

Continually renewing war.

Like Serpents they against me rise,
Under their lips who would confound me,
The Adders deadly poison lies.

From wicked hands, and from my foe,
From men of violence defend me,
Who seek my steps to overthrow.

For me they secret cords do hide,
To take me in their trap they vvatch me,
And set their net by my way side.

Thou art my God, I trust in thee:
O Lord my God, most high supernall,
Hear thou my cry, give ear to me.

My safety rests in thy might,
For thou do shield my head victorious,
The day our armies ioyn in fight*

Nor with their lewd device comply,
Cross their designs, so that they vant not,
Lest they themselves do magnify.

And those that do besiege me round,
Let their own counsels, mischief pleading,
From their own lips themselu^s confound.

Cast into flames let them remain,
Down deepest pits them headlong turning,
That they may never rise again.

On earth shall have no biding place:
The cruel man his sin destroys,
To ruin, mischief shall him chase.

Of the afflicted in distres:
Through him the poor man right obtains
Against them all that him oppres*

On my right hand I looked to see
If any were who would know me.
When means and friends I sought and tried
They me forsook on every side,
All hope of succor failed me,
For my soul none would careful be.

Thou only art my hope said I,
Thou art my refuge still at hand,
My portion in the living land.

With stretched out hands thy grace to gain,
For thee my thirsty soul desires,
As parched lands for shovvrs of rain.

My spirit fails, be comfortable,

Lest I become as miserable
As they that down the pit do slide.

In thee I trust, do not forsake me,

Such liking of him, such account to make?

Their hearts desire he fully satisfies,
Them he will hear to him for mercy crying,
Them he will save to him for succor flying.

But wicked men all he will quite destroy.

All flesh shall bles his holy name for ay.
Psalm 146. Thanksgiving.
^

PRaise to God my soul be giving,
To the Lord my soul give praise.

To my God I Will sing alvvayes,
To the Lord my God, my King,
While I am I Psalms will sing.

On their promise no trust have,
Nor in Adams generation,
For themselves they cannot save.

They return to earth again.
With them all their thoughts do perish,
And their enterprises vain.

Jacobs God does him maintain,
Happy who does place his trust
In the Lord his God most just,

Heaven and earth by his great might,
Sea, and all that it contains
He has framed all aright,
His truth and fidelity
He does keep eternally.

Giving sentence on their side:
For the hungry and distressed
He does food and aid provide:
By him prisners freedom find,
He the bondmen does unbind:

Gives eyes to see the light,
God in mercy great, and kindness,
Makes the crooked walk upright,
God loves them that just remain,
He the righteous does sustain.

His strong guard does them attend,
He does free them out of dangers,
Orphans vviddovves, does defend,
He does comfort them that grieve,
He the helpless does relieve
Wicked men the Lord destroys,
He does overthrow their way.

God the Lord shall reign for ay,
Sions God endures alvvayes,
Unto God the Lord give praise. Haleluiah.
Psalm 147. Thanksgiving.
PRaise ye the Lord, such praise is meetest,
Sing Psalms to God, such Psalms are sweetest,
The Lord to praise sing, never ceasing,
His praise is graceful, ever pleasing.

Builds up Jerusalem his city,
His Israel dispersed, deplored,
He has assembled and restored.

And comfort unto them reuealeth,
Full of compassion, them he minds,
He salues their sores, their vvounds up binds.
^


The number of the Stars he counts.
Them in their order he installeth,
Them by their proper names he calls.

Our refuge, of our strength the tovver,
Is infinite in understanding,
In might and wisdom all commanding.

The meek whose trust in him relieth,
He to the ground the wicked casts,
Confounding them, to nothing vvasteth.

Praise him with Harp, in Psalms thanksgiving.

With them the firmament does cover:
Prepares rain, which down he shovvreth,
On earth a main the shovvrs he povvreth:
The verdant grass he multiplieth,
Which on the mountains fructifieth.

The ravens young brood with meat supplyeth,
When hatched they hungry ly a crying,
Or fledg they forth for food are flying.

In strength of horse that fiercely fights,
Swift running legs with prize revvarded,
He has nor prized nor regarded.

In them that fear him takes pleasure,
Who on his mercy give attendance,
And on his promise have dependence.

Praise thou the Lord, with glory crowned,
Praise thou thy God, and him rely on,
Thou holy mountain, sacred Sion.

With strongest bars them fortifieth,
And all thy children he has blessed
Within thy walls by thee possessed.

There setleth laws and rightful orders:
To satisfy thee he bestows
The flovvr of finest wheat that grows.

His mighty povvr on it attends:
His word runs very svviftly speeding,
With all celerity exceeding.

Like fleeces of white vvoll it shovveth:
His frost all over hoary grows,
Which he abroad like ashes strovveth.

Which like to morsels forth he casts,
His frosts are so intolerable
Them to enduer who is able?

He sends forth his word to melt them,
At his command the vvarm vvind blovveth,
And then again the water flovveth.

And to obedience him prepares,
The laws and judgments he ordained
To Israel he has explained.

He has not dealt with any nation,
For those his judgments just and sacred
He unto them has not declared.
Psalm 148. Thanksgiving.
PRaise ye the Lord from heaven on high,
Praise him ye dvvellers in the sky,
All ye inhabitants of heaven
To God all praise by you be given.

Victorious hosts with glory crown him.
^


All stars of light his praise proclaim.

Ye waters in the cloudy sky.

The praises of his Name declare.

And to his glory consecrated:
He them established firm and suit,
Ay to continue and endure.
Their bounds of time and place decreed
By him, they never shall exceed.

In caves of earth: Whales in the deep:

Ye tempests, storms, winds boistrous blowing,
Which execute his sacred will,
Praise ye the Lord, his word fulfill.

Ye fruitful trees, and cedars tall:

All creeping creatures praise his Name.
Ye fetherd fovvls in the air swift flying,
Praise ye the Lord him magnifying.

Earths Princes, Judges which rule bear.


His Name is high advanced alone,
Ore heaven and earth his glories known.

His Saints to praise him he affects:
The children of his Israel,
To him most dear and near do dvvell.
Psalm Cxlix. Thanksgiving.
^

SIng to the Lord new songs excelling,
All in the Church of his Saints dwelling,
Sing praises in your congregation,
To God with adoration.

His high praise who did him create,
Let Sions sons rejoice and sing,
And triumph in their King.

Let Timbrels, Fife, and Flute be sounding.
Praise him with Harps svveet strings according,
His praise in Psalms recording.

His people his delight he makes:
With his salvation dravving nigh,
The meek to dignifie.

Shall be all glad with joy and pleasure:
Upon their beds in iubilation,
Shall shout with exultation.

The Lords praise high to raise and sound:
They with their two edged svvord in hand,
In arms complete shall stand.

Their foes to plague with desolation:
To punish them for their offenses,
With condign recompenses.

Their vanquished Princes, prisners make:
In strongest holds them to restr^in,
In irons them to chain.

To execute as it is recorded:
His Saints are to this honor raised,
The Lord our God be praised.
Psalm 150. Praise.
^

LEt us all Gods praise expres,
Praise him in his holiness:
Praise him in the firmament
Of his power permanent,
And his high magnificency.

In his goodness multitude,
Witnessing his excellency.

Both of Trumpets and Hautboyse,
Praise him in the Psaltery,
And the Harps svveet harmony.
Laud the Lord with praise abounding,

Organ, Sagbut, Cornamute,
Laud the Lord, his praise resounding.

Let the Cymbals loud expres
Vial, Virginal and lute,
Let nor string nor breath be mute,
Him to praise, let all indeuer.

What so ere does move or breath,
Praise the Lord most blessed ever.
The Song of Simeon, Luke 2.
^

Now let thy servant Lord.
According to thy Word,
In peace depart contented.

Before all people shevv'd,
Thy saving health presented.

To all the Gentiles sight,
This grace thou have declared,
And Israel to crown
With honor and renovvn,
This glory have prepared.
Decalogue, Exodus 20.
^

LIft up your hearts to God addressed,
All people hear what he does say:
Give ear unto his word expressed,
And his commandments all obey.
I am (says he) thy God eternal,
From Egypt I deliuerd thee,
From cruel servitude infernal,
Therefore have thou no God but me.

Of any thing in earth or sky,
To worship or to bovv before it,
Because a jealous God am I.

Let no oaths false or vain be vsd,
For he will hold him guilt ^^^er,
Who has his sacred Name abus d.

Spend thou and thine, the seventh in rest,
For God from his works admirable,
Reposed the seventh made holy, blessed.

That thou long days may happy live,
In The laud vvherof thou art the owner,
And which to thee thy God does give.





Thy neighbors house, nor wife to gai^,
Nor any servant he does hyer,
Nor ought that to him does pertain.
Have mercy on us Lord most blessed,
Inspire us with thy grace divine*
Write in our hearts thy Word expressed,
To keep thy laws our hearts incline.
FINIS.
