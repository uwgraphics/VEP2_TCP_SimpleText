The two fervent Lovers. OR
A warlike kind of wooing as here at large is said,
Between a brave young man, and a faithful hearted maid.
To the tune of the two loving Sisters, or lulling beyond thee.


AS Phoebus in the lustrious air,
the azure did adorn,
Diana with her Virgins fair,
upon that cheerful morn,
Did dance and sing to see the Spring,
the chirping birds likewise,
Melodious sound made dales rebound,
and echoes pierce the skies.
This time a lad his darling had,
my sweet said he, once prove me,
And thou shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
I drew me near unto the place,
to hear the friendly greeting,
A young man did his less embrace,
and bless the time of meeting:
Quoth he, my heart by Cupids dart,
is now so sorely pierced,
I dye, I dye unless a salve,
I have to be redressed.
Therefore my dear, while we are here,
in modesty once prove me,
And thou shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
As faithful Hero will I stand,
to his Penelope,
Leander like then shall command
my heart, so true I Will be:
My stormy eyes like winter skies,
thou here may well perceive,
My livings, goods, my life and all,
for thy content will leave.
Therefore my dear, etc.
Like English George I will appear,
so valiant in behavior,
For Sabrine bright, his chief delight,
who sought to win her favor:
With sword and shield in dreadful field,
as ancient stories say,
The fiery dragon there he killed,
and conquest brought away.
Therefore my dear, etc.
If bold Sir Guy for cheualry,
in countries farrs and near,
Did venture life to get a wife,
his Phillis fair and clear:
When he came back she was not flacke;
to fold him with embraces,
Within her arms, with hymns and charms
bedewed each others faces.
Therefore my dear, etc.
South Hamptons Earl to win his girl,
incountred with a foe,
Among Pagans, Turks and Infidels,
with many a bloody blow:
The Lions strong he laid along,
and forced the Serpent fly,
Great Askipart with lofty heart,
on ground he forced to lie.
Therefore my dear, etc.
The second part, To the same tune.


Five years be sore I did endure,
all for the sake of thee,
In direful wars with bleeding scars,
as plainly thou may see,
The Canon shot I dreaded not,
when I in place did come,
In storms and wind with blasts unkind,
I marched with sound of Drum.
Therefore my dear while we are here,
in modesty once prove me,
And thou shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
In Spain and France I did advance
my warlike spear and shield,
My trusty sword did me afford,
great conquest in the field:
While Trumpets sound madd ^^irs rebound,
my courage did not hail,
The Musketeers let bullets fly,
like stormy drifts of bail.
Therefore my dear while we are here,
in modesty once prove me;
And thou shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
Since from annoy my only joy,
I pass have such trouble,
Do not disdain nor me refrain,
to make my sorrows double:
One courteous word if thou afford,
my woes are all subdewed,
It scornefully thou answerest me,
my griefs are fresh renewed,
Therefore my dear while we are here,
in modesty once prove me,
And thou shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
She hearing of his loving talk,
how firm his mind was fixed
Said she, my love has spoke his part,
and mine shall be the next,
This kind reply then presently,
in modesty she said,
While thou art absent from my sight,
my heart was sore afraid.
That grisly death had taken the breath,
of thee which so did love me,
My heart and hand thou shall command
the would shall not remove me.
While Neptune rules the raging Seas,
and keeps within her bounds,
While Flora with her fragrant flowers,
bedeckes the dewy grounds:
While shepherds keep their feeding sheep,
along the pleasant fountains,
While roses spring, and small birds sing,
in valies, dales, and mountains.
My love with thine shall freely join,
the world shall not remove me,
Thou sure shall find in heart and mind,
how dearly I do love thee.
The golden Sun shall darkened be,
the Moon shall lose her light,
The glistering stars no eye shall see,
shine in the sable might:
The Turtle shall forsake her smate,
the married wife a maid
Shall prove to be, ere I to thee,
deny the words I said,
Then try and trust I will be just,
no creature shall remove me,
The world shall quite disolued be,
ere I refuse to love thee.
Now will we go, the man replied,
unto the place with speed,
To make of thee my lovely bride,
my word shall be my deed:
So on they went with good intent,
together to be married,
He liked or her, she liked of him,
nothing at all miscarried.
So here I end, wishing each friend,
may true and faithful prove,
Jove guide and bless with good success,
those that do truly love.
