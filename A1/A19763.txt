A brief of the Lady Dales petition to the Parliament.
Showing, Thomas Dale her husband being employed (in the year 1617) by the
East India Company as chief Commander of their Fleet into the East Indies,
Sir Tho. Dale employed to the East Indies by the Company, dies, leaving a
great estate there in his ship belonging to the petitioner as his Executrix.
and there dying (in the year 1619) leaving a great estate there in money and
other things (in his Ship called the Moon, then floating at Sea) to the value
of 20000 pounds, all which after his death belonged to the Petitioner as sole
Executrix of his last Will made before his going in that Voyage.

Shortly after his death, one Thomas Jones a Factor for the Company there, and
Robert Owen a servant of the said Sir Thomas, His estate there after his death
spoiled by the Companies factors and his own servant, and shared between the^
and the Gouerners, Treasurers and Co^mittees of the Company, and his
state-bookes taken and suppressed by them.
by confederacy with George Ball, William Methald and Augustine Spaulding
Factors likewise for the said Company (according to the usual customs of
those Factors in case of any man's death there, by a forehand private direction
from the Gouerners, Treasurers and Committees of that Company, to seize upon
all his goods for the use of the Company, and so to swal^ow up all his estate)
got aboard the said Ship in the absence both of the Master and Purser of the
same, and there unlawfully brake into Sir Thomas his Cabin and store-roome,
and took and carried from thence all his money, goods and estate there
whatsoever, together with diverse written books and memorials of the
particulars of his estate there, which books and memorials they have
suppressed and concealed, and have shared all the said estate between
themselves; and the said Gouerners, Treasurers and Committees of the said
Company giving no part thereof, nor the sight of the said books and memorials
to the Petitioner ever sithence.

The said Gouerners, The Gouerners, Treasurers and Co^mittees practice further
to defeat her of all her estate at home, lying in their hands.
Treasurers and Committes not herewith content, have since practiced to defeat
the Petitioner of all her estate at home (lying all in their hands) being a
matter of 2000 pou^ds or near thereabouts, adventured by her said husband in
both the joint stocks of that Company, besides the profits thereof and some
other moneys owing by the Company to her husband, causing an officer of theirs
to charge her for that purpose with supposed debts of her husbands to the
Company, to the value of 2600 pounds, which upon examination of another of
their officers in her cause, has been since confessed by him upon oath to be
an unjust charge, and excused as a mistaken by the Company.

That the Petitioner has sought remedy for the former of these wrongs (done in
the Indies) by a suite in the Admiraltie Court against the said Jones and Owen,
She seeks remedy in the Court of Admiraltie for her wrongs beyond seas, but
obtaines not justice there according to her proofs.
being the principal actors of the said wrongs and spoil there, where
notwithstanding that good proof was made, as well of their said unlawful
fact, as of diverse particulars of the said estate (to a great value) so
unlawfully taken away by them, besides a much greater estate concealed by their
taking and suppressing of the said books and memorials, yet through the
greatness and potencie of the said Gouerners, Treasurers and Committes bearing
those fellows out in that suite against the Petitioner, she could not there
obtain recompense of the said wrongs, All she has, thus detained from her,
not able to maintain suite, her witnesses not to be had at all times, their
depositions already taken, not serving in any other Court.
according to her proof made thereof.

So the said Gouerners, Treasurers and Committees, and those others before
mentioned, detaining from the Petitioner all she has; and the said Gouerners,
Treasurers and Committees not only denying to yield her any part of her means
in their hands, either for the righting of her self by suite, or for her
necessary maintenance, but refusing also very scornfully as much as to treat
with her (or her friends for her) of justice and equity, especially because
the depositions already taken in her cause, will not avail her in any other
ordinary Court; and her witnesses (of the wrongs done her beyond Seas) being
seafaring men, are not to be produced at all times to serve her turn, some of
them (who have been examined already in her cause) being since gone again to
Sea. Praying this high Court to consider of her cause, to call the parties, to
view the state-books and the proofs already made, and thereupo^ to take order
for her relief.


Humbly therefore prays this honorable Court to take her cause into their
considerations, to call the parties above mentioned (or such of them as are
near at hand) to appear forthwith before them, commanding them to bring the
said books and memorials into the Court, and upon view thereof, together with
such proofs as are already made in the cause, without further trouble or other
examinations, to take such order for her relief and satisfaction for the said
several wrongs, as their wisdoms shall find agreeable to justice and
equity.
