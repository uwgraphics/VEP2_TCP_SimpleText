THE COMMUNION of Saints. A treatise of the fellowship that the faithful have
with God, and his Angels, and one with an other; in this present life.

Gathered out of the holy Scriptures, by H. A.

Let thy hand help me (Lord,) for I have chosen thy precepts.

Psalm. 119. 173. Imprinted at Amsterdam by Giles Thorp. 1607.

To the Christian Reader, Grace mercy and peace from God be multiplied.
THe communion of Christians with the Lord and among themselves, is a doctrine
(good reader) both needful and comfortable to be known: for it is the stay and
strength of the soul in many tentations, and the means to conse^v the Church
steadfast in faith and love. And if in this point men's minds be settled aright,
upon the ground of Gods word; they will be as the Exodus 36. 20. 23. 24* etc.
boards of the Tabernacle standing upright, with their tenons sastened in
sockets of silver. For what is sweeter to a troubled conscience, then the
assurance of salvation; and what is better to stablish our weak and fainting
faith, then when both flesh and heart do fayl, to know and feel, that Psalm. 73.
26
God is the rock of our heart, and our portion for ever? Again, how good is it,
and how pleasant, for brethren to dwell together in unity! Psalm. 133.
like the precious ointment on Aarons head, and the dew on the mountains of
Sion. God has appointed his holy son Jesus, to be the head and governor of
his people; the Heb. 5. 9.
author of eternal salvation to all the that obey him. He has set up also the
kingdom of Christ on earth, which is his Church* the 1 Timothy ^. 1^
pillar and ground of truth. He is the Ioh. 8. 18.
light of the world, whom al must follow, that would have the light of life; and
Rev. 21. 9. 10. 11.
Jerusalem his spowse, is made bright by his glory, and the people which are
saved Rev. 21. 24*
shall walk in the Isa. 60. 1. 2. 3.
light of it. He is the Isa. 9. 6.
Father, this the Gal. 4. 26.
mother of us al. Of the Son it is said, Psalm. 2. 12.
happy ar all that shroud in him, for he is our Isa. 32. 2.
hiding place from the wind, our refuge from the tempest of Gods wrath: of Sion
also it is said, y^ Isa. 14. 32.
the poor of his people shall shroud in it; for there has the Lord Isa. 4. 5. 6.
created a clowd by day, and flaming fire by night, (as when Exodus 13. 21
he brought his Israel out of Egypt) and upon all the glory, is a defense;
there is a shadow in the day for the heat, a refuge and shelter for the storm
and for the rayn. It is requisite therefore, that al men come Mat. 11. 28
to Christ, if they would have life, and by him Ioh. 14. 6.
unto the Father, and abide in 1 Ioh. 1. 3.
communion with them both; that they may be Phil. 3. 9.
found in him, and have the justice which is of God through faith; that they
may verse. 10.
know him, and the virtue of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
afflictions, and be made comfortable unto his death: this is as the first and
great commandment of the law, and the second is like unto it, that they seek
Deuteronomy. 12. 5
the place which he has chosen to put his name there, and Psalm. 26. ^.
love the place where his honor dwells, where he Song. 1. 6.
feeds and causes (his flock) to ly-down at noon; that thither they bring
Isa. 60. 5.
their riches, their glory and honor, Rev. 21. 26.
that of every such one the Lord may count when he writes the people, Psalm.
87. 6.
He was born there; that so being Gal. 3. 29. and 4. 26. 28 31.
Christ's, and children of the free woman, and heirs by promise; they may Act.
26. 18
receiv forgivnes of syns, and inheritance among the^ which are sanctified by
faith in him: for he has said, that Isa. 65. 9.
his elect shall inherit his mountayn, and his servants shall dwell there. But,
two things there are, which will hinder our feet from running this way, if we
beware not of them: the one is, too much liberty which many men take in the
faith of the gospel and obedience of the same, whiles they turn Gods grace into
wantonness, and abuse his mercy to the fulfilling of their own lusts and
licenciousnes; whereas they should make an end of their salvation Phil. 2. 12.
in fear and trembling, knowing that even the 1 Pet. 4. 18.
righteous ar scarcely saved. Whiles also they take boldness to communicate in
spiritual actions with any, supposing that the syns of some, or of the public
congregation cannot hurt them, especially if in heart they disallow the evil,
and condemn the same. Such men seem not to discern the nature of communion, how
far it reaches; or the contagio^ of syn, how far it infecteth. They seem
neither to have learned the Law Hag. 2. 12. 13. 14.
which taught that a man by bearing or touching holy things, was not himself
made holy thereby, but a polluted person touching any of them, made them
vnclear: nor the doctrine of the gospel, which confirms, that ^ Cor. 10.
(...).
they which eat of the sacrifices ar par takers of the altar; and al they verse.
17.
one bread and one body, which partake of one bread; where if there be but a ^ Cor.
5. 6. etc.
little leaven, it makes sour the whole lump. And then look how far they
partake with other men's syns; so far ar they in danger, to ^^^. 18. 4.
receiv of their plagues.

The other impediment, is over much straytnes which some men have in their own
bowels: whiles their feeble consciences ar too much affected, both with their
own and others infirmities. Such had need to have their knowledge and faith
increased, their hearts enlarged, least by expecting a greater perfection in
themselves and others, then is to be found upon earth, they faint and fall. Let
such look on the image of Christ, as he is portrahed Psalm. ^2. (...). ^3. Man.
(...). etc.
in the scriptures, whiles the chastiseme^^ of our peace was laid upon him; so
shall they find balm for their wounded consciences; and healing for their
sowles by his stripes; and their shivered bones will rejoice. ^or of his cup
must we al drinck our parts, and be baptized with his baptism, into his death,
before we can taste the sweetness of his life; and be under the rigor of that
schole-maister Gal. ^. 24.
the Law like servants, ere we can perceiv the adoption of sons, and liberty
of his faith and Gospel. And if he which knew no syn, and had but our syns
imputed unto him, felt such fears and sorrows in his precious sowl, and was so
smitt^n of God and humbled, so despised and rejected of the world: what shall we
exspect, in whose Romans 7.
^le^h there dwells no good thing. Let them also look upon the estate of
Christ's church in all ages from the ^^*
beginning, how it has been vexed with troubles and terrors, within and
without, and 2. 5.
they shall find Sions case to be continually as Rev. 12. 2
a woman in travel, whose payns and infirmities Gal 4. 19. 26. 27.
are sometimes so great, that the children come to the birth, 2 King. 19. 3.
and there is no strength to bring forth. And when they have viewed the many
tribulations through which the Lord has led his people, how he has suffered them
to be buffeted of Satan, persecuted by enemies without, and molested with
hypocrites within, for their trial and humiliation; they will confess that we
must walk here by 2 Cor. 5. 7.
faith and not by sight, for our Colos. 3. 3.
life is hid with Christ in God; his spowse Song. 1. 5.
is black, for the Sun has looked upon her, her own mothers sons have been
angry against her, and all the glory of the kings daughter Psalm. 45. 1^*
is inward.

And furthest astray are such vayn men as imagine to themselves a state of
perfection, as if they had already Phil. 3. 11. 12.
attained the resurrection of the dead: and do disclaim al Churches and
societies where sins are to be seen. Moses face is Exodus 34. 30. 33, 35.
hid from the^ as with a veil, they discern not the use 2 Cor. 3, 13. 14. 15.
of his law, nor end of his ministry, for a veil covers their hearts;
neither see they (...)
the possession that syn has in them, yea (...). 7. 17 (...) 1 Ioh. 1.
in all Saints, so long as they dwell in these howses of clay, for which cause
they sigh desiring to be clothed with their house (...). 5. 2.
which is from heaven, to be loosed and to be with Christ. And when the voyl
shall be (...). 1. 23.
taken from those men's hearts, who so far mistake themselves to be that they
are not: they will cry with the Leper, Lewit. 13. 45.
I am unclean, I am unclean; and will Ezech. 16. 61. 63.
remember their wares and be ashamed, and never open their mouth any more
because of their shame, but will Ezech. 20. 43.
judge themselves worthy to be cut of, for all their evils that that they have
committed. Such also as either of ignorance, or worse humor, do unorderly
depart, and rend themselves upon every occasion from the church and body of
Christ; will walk better, when they have learned to Gal. 6. ^.
bear one an others burden, and tread in the steps of Christ, his prophets and
Apostles; who used al good means with patience, to reclaim the offenders,
before they forsook them. Yet because the faith must not be held Iam. 2. 1.
in respect of persons, neither may we Exodus 23. 2
follow a multitude to do evil; and it often falls out, that the Isa. 1. 21.
faithful city becomes a harlot, and they which were M^c. 2. ^.
yesterday Gods people, are risen up on the other side as against an enemy:
therefore the Saints should be wise in heart, and not hold communion with any
but in the Light, in the faith, in the true worship of God; for he is gealous
even over his own people, and will not Exodus 23. 21.
spare their misdeeds, but will take his kingdom from them, and remove Rev. 2.
5.
the ca^dlestick out of the place, if they repent not; and as he says by his
prophet, Amos. 3. 2
You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I visit
you for all your inquities. Thus may Christians walk as they are counseled by
the wisdom of God, not being Eccles. 7. 18
just overmuch, neither verse, 19.
wicked overmuch, laying hold, and not withdrawing their hand from this, verse.
20.
that he which fears God, shall come forth of them al.

For this cause have I endeavored, (though the unfittest among many,) to help
forward in the way of truth, such as love the same with me; and have penned this
treatise following, for their sakes, that have not means and leisure to search
the scriptures as they should and would, or by reason of their weakness cannot
gather and compare the scriptures together for their comfort and assurance in
these points, as they desire. I have labored both for playnnes and brevity, as
I could in so large and ample argument; and by references rather sent the
reader to look himself into Gods book, then to insist upon collections or
expositions of mine own. Wherein if any places be alleged amiss or impertinent,
or things gathered otherwise then the text will afford; (as through my
ignorance, or vnheedines, no doubt many may ^e:) I humbly ask pardon for the
same, both of God and his people; and do (...) ^^^ reader not to rely upon my
judgment in any thing, but as himself by the wisdom of Gods spirit, shall see
agreeable unto truth. For if any shall buyld upon my words, with out sure ground
from the Law of the Lord; he shall first offend God, who has given his
scriptures by divine inspiration to teach and persuade al truth, to improve and
correct 2 Timothy 3. 16 17.
al error, to instruct in righteousness, and make men perfect unto every good
work; he shall injury me also, who have written these things to be tried and
examined by Christ's law, not to be accepted for a law; and he shall injury his
own sowl, by relying upon the word of frayl man whose breath is in his
nosthrils, which cannot stablish the heart, nor assure the conscience in any
thing. Let therefore the grass wither and the flower fade, for it is the Isa.
40. 8.
word of our God that shall stand for ever.

Finally this one thing I would advertise thee of, (good reader,) that sometimes
I allege the scriptures otherwise then our common translations have them; when
the force of the Original words, does afford an other or more ample sense.
Herin I fear not to be blamed of any that love the truth in incorruption; and
for the places so changed, I leave them to their trial, that are men of
judgment. The Lord who is author of every good gift unto al men, who passes
by the syns of his servants, and covers al their trespasses; pass by in
mercy, whatsoever in this work is done amiss: and turn these my labors, to
the glory of his name, and the benefit of his people. Amen.

CHAPTER 1.
Of the Communion and peace that was at the first; and how soon it was broken.

FOr as much as we find in the Scriptures so great a difference made between
the sons of Adam, that some ar named the children 1 Ioh. 3. ^. Hos. 1. 10.
of God, of 1 These. 5. 5.
the Light and Day, the Dan. 7. 22.
Saints of the Most-high, the Lords Psalm. 135. 4.
chief treasure, the 1 Pet. 3. 10.
heirs of blessing; othersom, the Genesis 6. 2.
children of men, of Luke 16. 8.
this world, of the Ioh. 8. 44.
Devil, and 2 Pet. 2. 14.
of curse; and the one of these sorts commanded to 2 Cor. 6. 17

unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: it is good and needful that we
know, both who ar the persons, and what be the causes and conditions of this
communion; how far the bounds and limits of it do extend. For the better
perceiving hereof; let us take a summarie view, of the first state of us all.

2. God which has made of Act. 17. 26
one bloodal mankind, to dwell on all the face of the earth; made in the
beginning, Genesis 1. 31.
al things good: but chiefly imprinted the image of his Majesty, on Angels and
on men, and comunicated his graces with them. The Angels he created holy Psalm.
104. 4.
Spirits, Psalm. 103. 20
excelling in strength, and in Dan. 10. 5. 6
glory; and in all ability and readiness to do his will; and set them to serve
himself in Mark. 12. 25 Luke 2. 15
heaven, there to behold the joyful light of his face; where the Dan. 7. 10
many thousa^ds of them minisster unto him, and are as Psalm. 68. 17 and 18. 10.
charrets whereon his Majesty rides. Unto them he vouchsafed this love and
honor, that they should be named the Job. 1. 6.
Sons of God; yea his own glorious title he imparteth unto them, when in the
scripture he calleththem Psalm ^7. 7. with Heb. 1. 6* and Psalm 8. 6. with Heb.
2. 7
Gods. And for this their excellent creation, he requires of them Psalm. 148.
10 2. 5.
praise and glory; which those heavenly soldiers cheerfully Luke 2. 13. Isa.
6* 3.
perform to the Lord of hosts of whose glory the whole earth is full.

3. Gods favor unto man above a^ earthly creatures, appears in the goodly
frame and fashion, first of his body made of Genesis 2. 7.
earthly mould in admirable comelines, bewty and proportion; and with
alsufficient furniture of several members, for his own use and service of his
Maker. He is so clad Job. 10. 11.
with skin and flesh and joined together with bones and synewes; the veins and
arteries ar so disspred over al, and every part so cunningly framed, in such
cvrious weise, that the Prophet compares his fashioning, to an (...)
embroderie beneath in the earth; Psalm. 139. 15
and minding this excellent workmanship, says unto God, Psa. 139. 14.
I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Into the body (the
house Job. 4. 19.
of clay) God did inspire the Genesis 2. 7.
breath of lives, and the man became a living sowl; for the breath of the
Almighty gave him Job. 33. 4.
life, and this breath or mind of man, is Pro. 20. 27.
the light or candle of the Lord, which searches all the bowels of the belly.
This spiritual and immortal substance so infused had very singular and gracious
endouments of Job. 38. 36.
wisdom, understanding, will, and many affections, al Genesis 1. 31.
good for the holy Genesis 1. 26.
Trinity had consulted ^ John. 5, 7.
together to make him an excellent creature; and so the man did carry the image
of God, Genesis 1. 27.
for in it he was created. He had Col. 3. 10. Eccles. 7. 31.
knowledge, righteousness and holiness for performance of al duties to his maker,
and his fellow creatures; and this in Ephesians. 4. 24
truth simplenes and sincerity. He had Genesis 1. 28.
rule and sovereignty over the earth and seas, and all the plenty of them; he
knew the hidden nature of the creatures, and gave them Genesis 2. 19.
names accordingly; this world was made for his sake, even the glorious Deuteronomy.
4. 19
Sun and Moon and Stars for his use and service. He had the Genesis 1. 28.
blessing of the Lord upon himself and the creatures under him; a Ge^. 2. 18.
22.
help like unto himself made and given unto him for comfort and procreation of
his kind; a Genesis 2. 8. 9
garden of delight, full of al pleasant fruits planted by Gods own hand for to
yield him food and solace; he was al honorable inwardly and outwardly there was
nothing in sowl or body whereof he might be Genesis 3. 25.
ashamed; for he was the Act. 17. 28.
genera. tio^ and 1. Cor. 11. 7.
glory of his God, he had given him Job. 10. 12.
life and grace, and his visitation preserved his spirit.

4. And God which made al things Prove. 16. 4.
for his own sake, made this earthly king to be his subject and to serve him:
Wherefore he communicated with him his word, informing him how to walk both in
body and mind obedient to his will. For outward exercise he had the garden to
Genesis 2. 15.
dress and to keep; for inward contemplation, the seventh day verse. 3.
sanctified as a holy rest: and two trees before him of diverse end and use, the
one verse. 9.
of life, by the eating whereof he might have hope to live in God Genesis 3. 22.
for ever; the other of knowledge of good and evil, the tasting whereof would
bring him unto assured Genesis 2. 17.
death, with all his posterity. Thus God gav a law to man in his innocence,
and required obedience which was easy to be performed; which he graciously
would accept; for which, his blessing should have abidden, his favor and light
of his face have shined still upon him continually. Then did the Lord Psalm. 104.
3^
rejoice in his works, and his Wisdom Prove. 8. 31.
took solace in the compass of his earth; peace was between him and his
creatures, al his works Psalm. 145. 10.
did praise him, and his Saints did bless him; the Job. 38. 7.
stars of the morning sang praises together, and all the sons of God (the
Angels) rejoiced.

5. And then some beams of the incomprehensible light and joy and sweet
society, which the Father Son and Holy Ghost had from al eternity Prove. 8.
30. Ioh. 17. 5.
among themselves in the unity of the Godhead; were communicated with those
principal creatures the Angels and men; whiles the one sort did Mat. 18. 10.
always behold his face in heaven, the other enjoyed his favors in paradise:
then also was sweet harmony and most comfortable fellowship, peace and amity,
Job. 5. 23.
between the creatures, for their mutual delight and consolation; with out
division discord or enmity. There were no hateful spirits made to rebel against
God, to tempt and torment man, or misuse any other creature. No death diseases
or calamities to molest them; no terrors to drive them from their Maker; no
guilty fears to afflict the sowl, no noysom lusts to reign or rebel in their
bodies; nor any other means to hinder or disturb the peace and communion, or
cause jarr and debate among al or any Gods handy works.

6. But some of those sons of God the Angels, soon 2. Pet. 2. 4. John. 8. 44.
sinned; and abode not in the truth, neither Jude. verse. 6.
kept their first estate; but forsook their own habitation where they dwelt in
bliss with God: and so became the causes of their own endless and unspeakable
miseries. For they having fallen of their own accord; were not helped nor 2.
Pet. 2. 4.
spared, but forsaken of God, separated from the other holy and elect Angels,
thrust out of Heaven, and bound in bonds of eternal night and darkness, to be
reserved for judgment at the appointed time.

7. These Spirits, being of Saints become unclean Divils, hateful to the
Lord, impenitent and malicious in themselves; fell also to be John. 8. 44.
mankillers even from the beginning; and liars against the truth of Gods word;
Genesis 3. 1. 2 etc.
assaulted our first Parents, the woman by the Serpent, the man by the woman;
and by subtilty drew them into transgression of Gods plain* Law, and so into
the snares of sin and death: and this soon after their seating in paradise, as
by Moses narration does appear. For which willing transgressio^, whereby those
our progenitors wrapped Romans 5.* 12. 15. 18.
themselves and al their offpring in everlasting woe and wretchedness: the
communion and peace between God and man, was soon disanulled also; and with all
earthly creatures for man's sake. Then was Gods Genesis 3. 14 -- 17 etc
curse poured out on the head of that old Serpent, and his wrath into the
world; where the creature became Romans 8. 20. etc
subject to vanity. Man which had hid himself from the face of his Maker, was
found out, arraighned and judged for his disobedience; was thrust out of the
garden of pleasure, and the holy Cherubims Genesis 3. 24.
Angels kept him from the tree of life. Thus was his happiness suddenly changed
into misery; in labor and sorrow to spend his days til the spirit go out of
him unto God for judgment; and the body return to dust.

Man (that is) in honor, and understands not; he is like to the beasts, that
perish.

Psalm 49. 20. Chapt. 2.
Of the horrible miseries that Divils and men fell into, after they had forsaken
God.

That we may the better discern Gods grace unto us in Christ, who has freed us
from al calamities, and restored us to a most happy state, from which we shall
never fall: let us take a view more particularly of the many miseries which syn
did bring upon the creatures; so will the benifit of our redemption appear most
precious our hearts shall be filled with gladness, and our mouth with songs of
praise, to him that has saved us from so great a destruction.

2. The Divil having willingly rebelled against God, repented not of his
wickedness, but being full of malice, set himself as an enemy against the Lord
and his creatures. And for this cause is named in Hebrew Job. 1. 6. Re^ 20. 2.

4. Men that had been made in the similitude of God, holy just happy and
immortal, without any want or imperfection in sowl or body; not co^tinewing in
this honor but making shipwreck of faith by believing the word of Satan; and
of good conscience, by obeying his counsel, and acting the same: whereas they
were promised to be as Genesis 3. 5.
Gods knowing good and evil, fell by this means into corruption and misery, and
became like divils, Atheists. Ephesians 2. ^2.
without God in the world; subject to the horror of his wrath, and eternal
damnation. Whose woeful estate is to be considered, first in regard of sin;
(which stayed not in one actio^ but fretted as a canker and overflowed all:)
secondly of punishments for sin; Both of these are in sowl and body and their
full mesure or accomplishment is, of the one in this world, of the other in the
world to come.

5. The first sin of man was as venim, that sodde^ly spread it self into all the
powers of sowl and body: and subdued the^ al under death and corruption so soon
as the serpent had bitte^ him. And as he was the root of al mankind; so did the
contagion also spread into all the branches his children. By Romans 5. 19.
his disobedience, many were made sinners, and became ^ dead; even by the ^e.
15. ver. 16.
one offense of that one man, was the evil propagated unto ver. 18.
al men, to condemnation: who now being evil by nature, could neither Mat. 12.
34
speak nor do good, but daily wexed worse. So that when the Lord Psalm. 14. 2.
3. 4. Romans 3. 10. 11. 12.
from heaven looked down upon the son^s of Adam, to see if there were any that
did understand, that did seek God: behold al were gone back, al were corrupt,
none that did good, no not one; yea even the children Lev. 12. Psa. 51. 5. and
58. 3
from their birth and conception, unclean and sinful.

6. The corruption and nakedness of man in sowl, is to be seen in the
Understanding, which 1. Cor. 2. 14 Ier. 10. 14.
perceives not, neither can know the things of God; yea though light shine
into this darkness, yet does not the John. 1. 5.

sound of fear is in their ears, that in their prosperity the destroyer shall
come upon them, neither beleev they to return out of darkness. So that in this
misery, lothing longer life; some lay violent hands 2 Samuel 17. 23. Act. 1. 18.

captiving and murdering one an other both secretly and openly, not sparing
their own brethren, wives, children, or dearest friends, in their savage wrath,
hatred and cruelty. The Lord moreover afflicts their bodies with Deuteronomy. 28.
21 22. 35. etc.
many greevous and noysom sicknesses; their bowels ar inwardly tormented with
payns, their joints and lims with aches; silthy leprosies, sores and botches do
vex and deform them; burning and pestilent fevers do afflict and consume them:
neither is there any part or member from the crown of the head to the sole of

Job. 21. 30. CHAP. III.
Of man's redemption, and the renewing of his peace; by the grace of God in
Jesus Christ.

1. God, though he spared not the Angels which sinned of their own accord, and
maliciously drew man into their condemnation: yet showed he favor to Adam and
his children, when it was neither deserved nor asked. For of them, he had Ephesians.
1. 4.
chosen to be his, before the foundations of the world, and Mat. 25. 34
prepared for them a kingdom, which it was Luke 12. 32.
his pleasure to giv unto them; therefore could he not be hindered, Prove. 21. 30
no wisdom nor understanding, nor counsel could prevail against him, but Psalm.
33. 11.
his own counsel did stand for ever, and the thoughts of his heart, throughout
al ages; he also is John. 10. 29.
greater then al, and none is able to take his sheep out of his hand; therefore
he said unto them, Ezekiel. 16. 6.
when they were polluted in their own blood, ye shall live; even when they were
in their blood, he said unto them, ye shall live; I will Hos. 13. 14.
redeem them from the power of the grave, I will deliver them from death.

2. Yet because as his mercy should be magnified, his justice also was to be
satisfied, and death inflicted for the transgression of his law; and now man's
misery and weakness was such, as endure death he might, but overcome it he Job.
14. 10. 12.
could not, nor Psalm. 89. 48
deliver his sowl from the hand of the grave: therefore had God of his rich
grace and incomprehensible love, ordained his John. 1. 14. 18.
only begotten Son, which was in his bosom, John. 10. 30.
one with himself, and in glory with him John. 17. 5.
before the world was; by whom Cols. 1. 16. 17.
al things were created in heaven and in earth, things visible and invisible,
and in whom al things consist; even this his own dear son had ye Father
ordained 1. Pet 1. 20.
before the foundation of the world, that he should Mat. 1. 21.
save his people from their syns, and 1. These. 1. 10
deliver them from the wrath to come.

3. And forasmuch as being in the Philip. 2. 6.
form of God, and 1. Ioh. 5. 20.
very God himself, (who lives and is blessed for ever) he could not in that
nature and glory (wherein 1 Timothy 6. 16
only is immortality,) partake with man's wretchedness, or taste of his death,
which yet by Gods grace Heb. 2. 9.
he was to taste for all men: therefore was it also ordained, that the John. 1. 14.
Word should be made flesh, even the Son of God, when he came into the world,
should be made of Gal. 4. 4.
a woman, and of the Act. 13. 23.
seed of earthly man according to the flesh; that he should take on him the
form Phil. 1. 7.
of a servant, and be found in shape as a man, partaker Heb. 2. 14.
with his children of flesh and blood, that he might suffer for their sake, be
touched with the feeling of their infirmities Heb. 4. 15.
and in all things tempted in like sort, yet without syn.

4. This incarnation of the Lord whereby he should become our Mat. 1. 2^.
Emmanuel, that is, God with us; was not to be man's work, or brought to pass
by carnal generation, but by the Luke 1. 35.
holy Ghost, and power of the most high, overshadowing a virgin, whereby she
should verse. 31.
conceiv in her womb, and bear a verse. 35.
holy thing that should be caled the Son of God. Who for the fulness of the
grace of the Godhed, which was to Colos. 2. 9.
dwell in him bodily, and the Luke 4. 18.
spirit wherewith he was to be anointed; should be named the Ioh. 1. 21.
Messiah and the Christ, that is the Anointed of God: and for the salvation of
sinners, should be crowned with the title of Mat. 1. 21.
Jesus, that is the Savior or Deliverer, at whose name Phil. 2. 10. 11.
every knee should bow, both of things in heaven and things in earth, and
things under the earth; and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is the
Lord, unto the glory of God the Father; who gave him to be Isa. 49. 6.
his salvation to the end of the earth.

5. For by this his Son, the Heb. 1. 3.
brightness of his glory, God would 2 Cor. 5. 19.
reconcile the world to himself, not imputing but freely Ephesians. 1. 7.
forgiving their syns unto them; and by this Col. 1. 15.
image of his own invisible majesty, would Col. 3. 10.
renew the heavenly image in man, which now was defaced, giving him Ezekiel. 36. 26
a new heart and a new spirit, even putting verse. 27.
his own spirit within him, and making him a 2 Cor. 5. 17.
new creature. For whereas the first Adam was made but a Genesis 2. 7.
living sowl, and having lost his life by syn, could not recover the same
again, but death Romans 5. 12. 14.
reigned over al: this second Adam which was a (...) 1 Cor. 15. 45.
live-making spirit, should Ephesians. 2. 5.
quicken them that were dead in trespasses and syns, and by his Ioh. 5. 25.
voice should raise them up, and give them life eternal; that so the dead men
Isa. 26. 19.
might live again, and they awake and sing, that dwell in dust.

6. The way to work out this wo^drous grace for men's redemption, was appointed
to be by great afflictions through which the Heb. 2. 10.
Prince of their salvation was to be consecrate, that many children might be
brought unto glory. For this Son of God the Lord and heyr of all Phil. 2. 7,
(...)
things, was to empty himself, and take on him the form of a servant, to become
lesser then the Heb. 2. 7. 9.
Angels, yea more deformed Isa. 52. 14.
then the sons of Adam, even a Psalm. 22. 6.
worm and not a man, the shame of men and contempt of the people, that when we
should see him, Isa. 53. ^.
he should have neither form nor beauty that we should desire him: though yet
in himself, he was much Psalm. 45. 2.
fayrer then the sons of Adam, al his parts and features and countenance so
excellent, as he was Song. 5. 16.
wholly delectable.

7. So when the first begotten of the Father was brought into the world, though
Heb. 1. 6.
all the Angels of God did worship him, the Mat. 8. 27.
winds and seas obeyed him, the Fish Mat. 17. 27.
paid his tribute, the Mark. 1. 13.
wild beasts lived at peace with him, and the very Luke 8. 28.
Divils confessed him, and were afraid: yet wretched man would not acknowledge
him, his John. 1. 11.
own received him not, he was Psalm. 69. 8.
a stranger to his brethren, an aliant to his Mothers sons, Isa. 53. 3.
despised he was and we esteemed him not. Yea God himself would verse. 10.
break him and make him subject to infirmities, and lay upon him ye verse. 6.
iniquity of vsal; for we Isa. 43. 24.
made him to serve for our syns, we wearied him with our iniquities; so that
innumerable troubles compassed him about, and our syns which now were Psalm. 40.
12.
his, took such hold upon him, that he was not able to lookvp; for which a cup
was Ioh. 18. 11.
give^ him of ye Father to drink, full of Mat. 26. 37. 38. Mark. 14. 33.
sorrow, fear, heavines, and agony, that made his sowl heavy even unto the
death, and he prayed his Father, that Mat. 26. 39
if it had been possible, it might have passed from him; offering up his prayers
with Heb. 5. 7.
strong crying and tears, and sweat Luke 22. 44.
like drops of blood trickling down to the ground, the shadow of death Job. 16.
16.
being upon his eyes. But because it could not be but he must drink (for
therefore Ioh. 12. 27.
came he to that howr,) and the Lord God had Isa. 50. 5.
opened his ear that he was not rebellious, neither turned back: he Psalm. 40.
7. 8
willingly gave up his body for a sacrifice, and bore the wrath of God due for
our trespasses, he which knew no sin 2 Cor. 5. 21^
was made sin for us; and Isa. 53. 12.
powered out his soul unto death.

8. Then came Satan the Prince of this world to see if he could have conquered
him, but he John. 14. 30.
had nothing in him: yea his own time was now come, John. 12. 31. 32.
now was he to be cast out, and Christ being lifted up from the earth, would
draw all men to himself. The serpent beset him with Psalm. 18. 4. 5
the snares of death, and with floods of Belial to make him afraid; but he said
unto death Hos. 13. 14.
I will be thy death, and unto the grave, I will be thy destruction; so he
spoiled Colos. 2. 15.
the Principalities and powers of that kingdom of darkness, made a show of them
openly, triumphed over them in the same cross, and destroyed Heb. 2. 14.
through death him that had the power of death, that is the Divil.

9. They for whom he suffered all these things regarded not the rock of their
salvation, but Isa. 53. 4.
judged him as plagued and smitten of God and humbled. He Isa. 63. 30
trod the winepresle alone, and of all the people there was none with him, his
Mat. 26. 56.
own disciples had all forsaken him and fled, that he by Heb. 1. 3.
himself might purge our syns. He looked Psalm. 69. 20.
for some to have pity on him, but there was none; for comforters, but none he
found; there was Psalm. 142. 4.
not any that would know him, al refuge failed him, none cared for his sowl.
His own people Act. 3. 13.
betrayed him, and denied in the presence of Pilat, when he had judged him to
be delivered, they verse. 14,
denied the holy one and the just, and desired a murderer to be given them.
Then was the Lord of glory misused, and suffered much speaking against of
sinners they Psalm. 109. 2. 3. 5.
opened upon him the mouth of deceyt, and compassed him about with words of
hatred, they rewarded him evil for good, and hatred for his friendship; they
Mat. 26. 67
spate on his face and buffetted him; they crowned him with Ioh. 19. 1. 2.
thorns and scourged him; he became a Psa. 109. 25
reproach unto them, they that looked upon him shaked their heads, yea rebuke
Psalm. 69. 20
did break his heart, and he was full of heavines, for Psalm. 22. 16.
dogs did compass him about, the assembly of the wicked enclosed him, they
peirced his hands and his feet, and gored John. 19. 34.
his side; they Act. 5. 30.
slew and hanged him on a tree, so was he made a Gal. 3. 13.
curse for us, for the Deuteronomy. 21. 23
curse of God was on him that was hanged.

10. But in his trouble he caled upon the Lord and cried unto his Psalm. 22. 1.
and 142. 5.
God, why have thou forsaken me? thou art my hope my portion in the land of the
living. Psalm. 69. 14. 15.
Deliver me out of the mire that I sink not, let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters, let not the water flood drown me, and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me; Psalm. 22. 2^.
deliver my sowl fom the Sword, my desolate sowl from the hand of the Dog. In
the end, he commended Luke 23. 46.
his spirit into the hands of his Father, Heb. 9. 17.
confirmed the Testament by his death, and unto the Psalm. 22. 15.
dust of death he was brought, his grave Isa. 53. 9.
was with the wicked.

11. But the sorrows of death were soon losed, because it Act. 2. 24.
was impossible that the Act. 3. 15.
Lord of life should be holden of it: for as he had power to lay down his life,
so had he power to take it again, John. 10. 18.
this commandme^t he had received of his Father, who Psalm. 16. 11.
showed him also the path of life, and Heb. 13. 20.
brought again from the dead, this great Shepherd of the sheep. Wherefore the
1 Cor. 15. 4.
third day he rose up alive, he rose up, and Psalm. 68. 1.
his enemies were scattred, and they that hated him fled from before him; and
now behold Rev. 1. 18.
he is alive for evermore, Amen: and has the keys of hell and of death; death
has Rom 6. 9.
no more dominion over him, for 1 Cor. 15. 54
it is swallowed up in victory.

12. Thus Gods hand was Psalm. 80. 17.
with the man of his right hand, with the son of man whom he made strong for
himself; the Lord Psalm. 20. 1. 2 3. 4.
heard him in the day of trouble, and sent him help from his Sanctuary,
remembered al his oblations and turned his burnt-offring into ashes, gave him
according to his heart, and fulfilled all his counsel, verse. 5
that we might rejoice in his salvation, and set up banners in the name of our
God, when the Lord had performed al his petitions. For he having thus through
the eternal spirit Heb. 9. 14.
offered himself without spott unto God, obtained verse. 12.
eternal redemption; and having drunk of the brook in the way, he Psalm. 110. 7.
therefore lifted up the head. He ascended up on high with triumph, leading
Psalm. 68. 18
captivity captive, and approached unto the Dan. 7. 13.
Ancient of days, who Ephesians. 1. 20. 21
set him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality
and power, and might, and domination, and every name that is named, not in this
world only but also in that which is to come, and made al things subject under
his feet; Dan. 7. 14.
gave him dominion and honor and a kingdom, that all peoples nations and
languages should serve him, his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall
never be taken away, and his kingdom shall never be corrupted, and this is the
name whereby we must call him, Ier. 23. 6.
Jehovah our justice.

13. And now the gates of the heavenly Paradise Luke 23. 43.
were opened to the sons of Adam, and the tree of Life, better then that from
which the Cherubims Genesis 3. 24.
sword had kept man, was Rev. 2. 7.
given him by Christ to eat of, and live for ever. Now felt men the effect of
that heavenly oracle that came out of Caiaphas mouth, John. 11. 50.
It is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and the Whole nation
perish not: for lo the wrath of God kindled for man's syn, was appeased by the
death of this 1 Timothy 2. 5. 6
man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all men, and 1 Pet. 2. 24.
bare our syns in his body on the tree, being the Heb. 7. 22.
surety of the Testament. It pleased the Father by him, the Isa 9. 6.
Prince of peace, to Col. 1. 20.
reconcile al things to himself, and to set at peace through the blood of his
cross both the things in earth and the things in heaven. For it was his
beloved son in 2 Pet. 1. 17.
whom he was well pleased, his chosen one Isa. 42. ^
in whom his sowl delighted, that had Ephesians. 5. 2.
given himself to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to
God, who smelled here a savor of rest, sweeter then that in Genesis 8. 21.
Noah's sacrifice, which caused him to say in his heart, that he would curse the
ground no more for man's cause though ye imagination of ma^s heart were evil from
his youth: for now there shall be Rev 22. 3. zach. 14. 11.
no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb (that was slain) shall be
in the city, he Deuteronomy. 32. 43
will be merciful unto his land, unto his people. The Angels saw this, and were
glad for our salvation, they sung at our Saviors birth, Luke 2. 13. 14.
Glory to God in the highest (heavens) and upon earth peace, toward men
goodwill. And when he was glorified, the thousand thowsands of them praised him
saying, Rev. 5. 11. 12.
worthy is the Lamb that was killed, to receiv power and riches and wisdom,
and strength, and honor, and glory and praise. The heavens Isa. 44. 23.
rejoiced for that the Lord had done, the lower parts of the earth showted, the
mountains forests and every tree burst forth into praises, for that the Lord
had redeemed Iaakob, and would be glorified in Israel. and Rev. 5. 13.
al creatures in heaven and in earth, under the earth, and in the sea, and all that are in them, gave Praise and honor and glory and power, unto him that
sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever more. Amen.

14. This grace was the 1. Cor. 2. 7.
Wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God had foredetermined
before the world unto our glory; but Job. 28. 21.
it was hid from the eyes of all the living, and hid from the fowls of ye
heaven; none 1. Cor. 2. 8. 9
of ye Princes of this world knew it, no ye had seen it, nor ear heard it,
neither came it into man's heart, only Job. 28 23.
God understood the Way thereof, and Ephesians. 3. 9.
from the beginning of the world it was kept secret and hid in him, and still
Mat. 11, 25.
he hides it from the wise and men of understanding, neither can the 1 Cor. 2.
14.
natural perceiv it until he revele it unto them by his 1 Cor. 2. 10.
spirit, which spirit sercheth al things even the deep things of God, and by it
we verse. 12.
know the things that are given to us of God.

15. And now Ephesians. 1. ^.
he has opened unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good
pleasure which he had purposed in Christ; he Isa. 62. 11.
has proclaimed unto the ends of the world, that the Savior of the daughter
Sion is come, his wages with him, and his work before him; that we might
clearly see the Ephesians. 3. 9.
fellowship of the mystery, and might be able to verse. 18. 19.
comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth and length and depth and
height, and to know the lov of Christ which passes knowledge, and might be
filled with all fulness of God; who has given us Isa. 61. 3.
bewty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of gladness for the
spirit of heavines, because our warfare is accomplished,.40. 2.
and our iniquity is pardoned. For while we were Romans 5. 8. 9. 10.
yet sinners, Christ died for us; and when we were enemies, we were reconciled
to God by his death, and now shall be saved by his life; for the Isa. 53. 5.
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed; he
has Rev. 1. 5.
washed us from our syns in his blood, and Heb. 9. 14.
purged our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God; and is gone up
into very heaven verse. 24.
to appear now in the sight of God for us, and there to Ioh. 14. 2. 3.
prepare us a place, that where he is we may be also. From whence he will
shortly show himself 2 These. 1. 7.
with his mighty Angels, to be verse. 10.
glorified in his Saints, and made marveilous in them that beleev; who after
that they have drunk of his cup, and been Romans 6. 3. 4.
baptized into his death and burial, and walked with him in newnes of life in
this vale of tears, and Col. 1. 24.
fulfilled the rest of his afflictions in their flesh, shall have their Phil* 3.
21.
vile bodies changed and fashioned like to his glorious body, the dead 1 Cor.
15. 52*
being raised up incorruptible, and such as 1 These. 4. 17*
live and remayn, being changed and caught up with them also in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air, and so shall they ever be with the Lord, their Mat.
13. 43.
faces shyning as the Sun, in the kingdom of their Father.

16. Although this mystery of Christ, Ephesians. 3. 4. 5.
was not opened unto the sons of men in other ages, as it was at last reveled
unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit: yet was the effect and sum
thereof, made known to all the Patriarchs from the beginning. For Jesus Christ
was Heb. 13. 8.
yesterday, is to day, and the same for ever, and Abraham John. 8. 56.
saw his day and was glad; Abel also by faith in him Heb. 11. 4.
obtained testimony that he was righteous; which faith he learned of his
father Adam; who heard of God the riches of this grace freely preached in
paradise, before the sentence of exile and death was pronounced upon him;
namely that the woman's Genesis 3. 15.
seed should crush the Serpents head; who also was showed the way to be by
death and sacrifice, a shadow whereof he saw in the Lambs Gone. 4. 4.
then slain and sacrificed in the service of the Lord. The great afflictions of
Christ and of his people, were foretold in the Serpents crushing of his ^eel,
and the enmity between the woman's seed and that Serpents; foreshewed also in
the ver. 8.
murder of Abel the just by Cain his wicked brother. To Christ gave Act. 10.
43. and 28. 23.
all the Prophets witness, that through his name all that believed in him,
should receive remission of syns: and the Act. 26. 7.
twelve tribes instantly serving God night and day, hoped to come unto this
promise. So in this hope and exspectation of redemption, by the Son of God, the
Fathers rested, and comforted their fainting sowles by faith, the Heb. 11. 1.
evidence of things not seen: by which faith verse. 13.
they saw the promises a far off, were persuaded, saluted them, and confessed
that they were strangers and pilgroms upon earth, and so died, having verse. 39.
40.
through their faith obtained testimony, but received not the promise; God
providing a better thing for us, that they without us, should not be made
perfect; but in patient hope pass out their days on earth; and after death
Job. 14. 14.
wayt all the days of their appointed time, til their changing shall come, and
then Dan. 12. 13.
stand up in their lot, (with us and al Saints,) at the end of the days.

17. But all this grace, and riches of the glorious mystery now manifested to
the Saints, Col. 1. 27.
which is, Christ in us the hope of glory; God did not communicate with all men,
neither yet does: save with some Mat. 20. 16.
few chosen in Christ Ephesians 1. 4.
before the foundation of the world. Which little flock have their election,
Romans 9. 11.
not by works, but by him that caleth, according to the Ephesians. 1. 5.
good pleasure of his own will: who without any unrighteousness Romans 9. 18.
has mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth; having made verse. 21.
22. 23.
as the clay-potter of one lump, some men vessels of mercy prepared unto
glory, and some vessels of wrath prepared to destruction; which yet
notwithstanding have many favors and benefits from God to draw them to
repentance out of the snare of Satan, but all in vayn for they despise the
grace proffered unto them, and run headlong into the condemnation, whereto they
were Jude. verse. 4.
of old ordained; let mercy be showed them, yet Isa. 26. 10.
will they not learn righteousness, in the land of equities they will do wickedly,
and will not behold the majesty of the Lord.

18. And of these there ar two sorts; some that are called to the knowledge of
the truth, and have Luke. 8. 13.
received it with joy* yet having no roots, beleiv but for a while, and in time
of tentatio^ go away. Yea of these there are, that have been once Heb. 6. ^. ^.
6.
lightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and been made partakers of the
holy Ghost, and have tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the
world to come: and yet not with standing fall away, and crucify again to them
selves the son of God* and make a mock of him; and Heb. 10. 29.
tread him under foot, and count the blood of the Testament as an unholy thing,
wherewith they were sanctified, and do despite the spirit of grace. Such, it
is Heb. 6 4. 6.
impossible they should be renewed again unto repentance; neither Heb. 10. 26.
^7.
remains any more sacrifice for their syns, but a fearful looking for of
judgment and violent fire which shall devour them. And such, howsoever they
were among the Saints, yet were they not of them, for then 1 John. 2. 19
they would have continewed with them; neither were they of Christ's sheep, for
then he would have John. 10. 27. 28.
given them eternal life, and they should never have perished, neither should
any have plucked them out of his hand; he would have put his fear in their hearts,
that Ie^. 32. 40.
they should not have departed from him; though they had fallen Psalm. 37. 24.
they should not have been cast off, for the Lord would have put under his hand.

19. Othersome there are, not caled to the faith but Ephesians. 2. 12.
strangers from the covenants of promise, whom God Act. 14. 16.
suffers to walk in their own ways, Psalm. 147. 19 20.
not showing the^ his word nor his statutes and judgments. Or if he cause his
gospel to come unto them, yet will not John. 5. 40.
they come unto him that they might have life; they hear not his words John. 8.
47.
because they are not of God; neither beleev, Ioh. 10. 26.
because they are not Christ's sheep; all the day long Romans 10. 21.
he stretches forth his hand to an vnperswadeable and gainsaying people. Yea
believe they cannot, because John. 12. 39. 40.
he has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see
with eyes nor understand with heart, and be converted, and he to heal them: the
Lord Isa. 29. 10. Romans 11. 8.
has covered them with the spirit of slomber.

20. And these are for the most part the Luke 10. 21.
wise and learned of the world from whom God hides the secret of his Gospel,
and works a marveilous work in this people, even a marveilous work and a
wonder (as Isa. 29. 14.
says the Prophet) that the wisdom of the wise men perish, for 1 Cor. 3. 20.
the Lord knows that their thoughts be vayn. Therefore he 1 Cor. 1. 19.
makes their wisdom to perish, and casts away the understanding of the
prudent; he powers Psalm. 107. 40
contempt upon princes, and causes them to err in desert places, out of the
way, and makes Job. 12. 21.
the strength of the mighty weak: he Luke 1. 51. 52
scatters the proud in the imagination of their hearts, and puts down the
mighty from the thrones: the 1 Cor. 1. 20.
wisdom of this world makes he foolishnes, and by the verse. 21.
foolishnes of preaching saves them that believe; which also are the verse. 27.
28.
foolish weak vile and despised things of the world, even things that are not;
which yet he has chosen to bring to naugh^ the things that are: that verse. 29.
no flesh should rejoice in his presence, but as it is written, verse. 31.
he that rejoices let him rejoice in the Lord.

21. Thus Christ crucified 1 Cor. 1. 2^. 24.
is to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks, foolishnes; and only to
them which are called, both of Jews and Greeks, he is the power of God, and
the wisdom of God; in whom they triumph and say, Lo Isa. 2^. 9.
this is our God, we waited for him, and he will save us; this is the Lord whom
we waited for, we will joy and be glad in his salvation.

22. And thus is there a distinction made of the sons of Adam, some left to
perish in their syns, the children of wrath Ephesians. 2. 3.
as they were by nature, who because they are not John. 3. 3.
borne again, they cannot see the kingdom of God: othersome are Rev. 14. 3.
bought from the earth and 1 Pet. 1. 23.
born a new of immortal seed, and are John. 17. 16.
not of this world, but have their Phil. 3. 20.
conversation in heaven, and Ioh. 1. 12. 13
power given them of Christ to be the sons of God, which are born not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

23. Between these two sorts of men is great difference; both in the affections
of God, who Romans 9. 13. Psalm. 146. 8. and 11. 5.
loves the one and hates the other: and of Christ, John. 17. 9.
who prays for one and not for another: and in their affections again
toward God, and one toward another. For the Saints Psalm. 18. 1. 1 John. 4.
19. ^1.
love the Lord, and have mutual love among themselves; but the wickeds Zech.
11. 8.
sowl abhors him; and they hate Ioh. 15. 18. 19.
such as he has chosen out of the world; and are hated again of Psalm. 139. 21.
22.
them with perfect hatred. Thus is there war and enmity Genesis 3. 15.
betwixt the just and the wicked, the one of them being Pro. 2^. 27.
an abomination to the other.

24. Hence is it, that the scripture speaks so much of the fellowship and
communion of the Saints, with God and among themselves; and of their
separation from the Divil, and from his children the wicked men eve^ in this
life, whiles yet they live together with them in civil society, and breath one
commune aier: exspecting with patience the full and final separation, which
Christ and his Angels Mat. 13. 39. 40. 41. etc.
will make at the last and great day of doom.

Of this holy communion here on earth, I purpose to entreat, as God has given
me to discern by his word. His gracious spirit breath upon my sowl, and guyd my
pen to set down his truth.

CHAPT. IIII.
Who be the Saints of this Communion.

THat we may the better discern the Com^unio^ of Saints, whereof we treat; let
us first consider who the persons be, that have fellowship together. The Head
and highest in this holy society is the Lord our God; who is not only Most
holy in himself, but co^municateth his holiness with us his creatures: and does
vouchsafe to have fellowship with us even in this life and world, as it is
written, 1 John. 1. 6. 7
If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do
not the truth: but if we walk in the light as he is in the light; we have
communion one with an other, (that is God with us, and we with him:) and the
blood of Jesus Christ his son, cleanses us from all syn. For this cause he is
often called in the scripture, the Isa. 5. 19. 24 Psalm. 71. 22. and 78. 41. and
89. 18.
Saint or Holy-one of Israel; and the Rev. 15. 3.
King of the Saints. This is to be understood of al three persons in the
unity of the Godhead; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, of whom it is
written The mystery of the Holy trinity Ioshu. 24. 19. and
He (is) holy Gods; and accordingly his people ar named, the Dan. 8. 24. in the
Hebrew.
people of the Holy ones.

2. Jesus Christ, as he is God manifested in the flesh, is the Mark. 1. 24
Saint of God, the Rev. 3. 7.
Holy one and the True, even the Isa. 54. 5.
holy one of Israel; being himself full of the Luke 4. 1.
Holy ghost, and therewith Mat. 3. 11. Act. 1. 5.
baptiseth his church whereof he is the mediator. And was figured out by the
High priest in the law, who in type of him was also caled the Psalm. 106. 16
Saint of the Lord, and carried this writing graven in gold upon his forehead,
Exodus 28. 36
Holiness to Jehovah. With this Jesus our redemer, we that beleev, have a very
near communion; according to that which is written, Heb. 2. 11.
He that Sanctifies (which is Christ) and they that are sanctified (which are
his people) are al of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
brethren. And again, 1 Cor. 1. 9.
God is faithful, by whom ye are caled unto the communion of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord.

3. The elect and blessed Angels, are also Deuteronomy. 33. 2. ^ith Act. 7. 53. Jude.
ver. 14.
Saints; having sanctity by creation, continewed and confirmed unto them for
ever. These heavenly spirits have communion not only with God, in whose
presence they stand; but also with us the children of God through faith; by
which we are come unto the Heb. 12. 22.
great assembly of the many thowsands of them, have them for our Psalm. 34. 7.
and 91. 11. 12.
guardians, and acknowledging themselves to be our Rev. 22. 9.
fellow servants.

4. Al men and women, caled to the faith of God, ar Deuteronomy. 33. 3. 1 Cor. 1. 2.
Saints by caling; being sanctified by Christ Jesus, and one with an other are
Heb. 3. 1.
holy brethren. Of these some are Mat. 27. 52.
Saints departed this life, and sleeping in the Lord: othersome ar on earth,
and whiles they here live (notwithstanding their many infirmities and
afflictions) ar Psalm. 16. 3. Dan. 7. 18. 21. 22. 25. Romans 1. 7.
Saints of the most High; a 1 Pet. 2. 9.
holy nation

5. This happy society. our fathers of old saw shadowed in the Tabernacle,
where God Psalm. 78. 60.
dwelt among me^. His own gracious presence appeared, when his Exo 40. 34.
glory filled the Tabernacle, and his voice was heard of Moses Lev. 1. 1.
out of the same; and the Psalm. 132. 8.
Ark of his strength was a continual sign of his residence and rest therein.
His son Christ was represented by the Exo. 25. 17.
Mercie-seat or Propitiatory covering the Ark, in whom and by whom God is
reconciled with his people, who therefore is caled the hilacterio^. Romans 3. 25.
Propititiatory or Reconciliation; from that was the Nom. 7. 89.
voice of God heard speaking, even as by Christ Heb. 1. 2.
he speaks to the end. The Angels were figured in the Cherubims upon the
Exodus 25. 18 and 26. 1. etc.
mercie-seat, and in the courtaines of the tent round about, for so those
blessed Spirits * Heb. 1. 6. 14.
'minister unto Christ and to his church the heyrs of his salvation. The
multitude of believers were resembled in the Lev. 24. 5. 6.
twelve cakes (according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel,) set
upon the pure table before the Lord, with verse. 7.

Lord in steed of them. So we Christians are 1 Cor. 5. 7. (...)

CHAP. V.
Holiness or Sanctity what it is.

THe Scripture caleth that thing or person holy, which is separated from
profanenes and pollution, and is addicted or applied to divine use or service
of God. Thus the Sabbath day was hallowed, when God had severed it from commune
labor and humane employments, to be spent in heavenly exercises and
meditations, whereupon it is named Exodus 35. 2. and 16. 23.
the holy Sabbath of rest to the Lord: The like is to minded for all Levit 23.
2. 3. 4. 21. 24. 27. 35. 36. 37
other feast days appointed of God for holy convocations. The firstborn of man
and beast Exodus 13. 2. Deuteronomy. 15. 19. Number. 3. 13. 41. and 8. 17. 18.
were sanctified to the Lord, by being exempted from man's use; dedicated to
God, and employed in his service. Hence was it, that all strange or unclean
persons were forbidden to Exodus 29. 33 Lev. 22. 3 4. 5. 6. 9. 10.
eat, yea or to touch the holy things. And when the Israelites were sanctified
ceremonially, it was Exodus 19. 14 15. 22
by washing their garments, absteyning from their wives, thus preparing their
bodies and minds to converse with God. And in the whole course of their life,
this was their sanctification and signs thereof, to absteyn from all syn and
uncleanness, as also from communion with the sinners and unclean: and to give
themselves to the service of God and keeping of his laws.

2. This is to be seen in many particulars. As, the calling and Lev. 20. 26.
separating of Israel from other people that they might be holy unto God. The
shadow hereof; namely abstinence from eating unclean meats (which figured Act.
10. 12. 13. 17. 20. 28 etc.
their refreyning from the fellowship of wicked men,) for a sign and testimony
of their Lovit. 11. 44 45. Exodus 22. 31. Deuteronomy. 14. 21.
sanctification and holiness with the Lord. To Moloch they might not offer their
children, for that was to Lev. 20. 3.
defile Gods sanctuary and pollute his holy name; nor vrs. 6. 7.
turn after soothsayers, for the same cause. All moniments of idolatry they
were to destroy, Deuteronomy. 7. 5. 6.
because they were a holy people to the Lord their God. Idolatrous rites and
customs they were to refreyn, Deuteronomy. 14. 1. 2.
for the same cause. Even their bodily excrements were to be covered, Deuteronomy. 23.
13 14.
that their host might be holy before the Lord. And being thus cleansed from
evil, they were willed to remember, and do al his commandments, Number. 15. 40
and so be holy unto their God.

3. The new testament also teaches this same, whiles it opposes 1. Cor. 6. 9.
10. 11. 1. These 4. 7.
sanctity unto all manner syn and uncleanness; and exhorts us to 2. Cor. 7. 1.
cleanse our selves from al filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and so grow up
unto full holiness in the fear of God: that being sanctified 1 These. 5. 23
throughout, we may by good works give all our members Romans 6. 19.
servants unto righteousness in holiness.

CHAPTER. VI.
HOw holiness is given unto God and Christ, and how unto creatures.

Holiness is ascribed unto God in the word, both by Isa. 6. 3. Psalm. 99. 3. 5.
9. Rev. 4. 8.
Angels and men, in two respects; 1. Because he in himself is sanctity and
purity it self; and it is impossible that in him should be any evil syn, or
uncleanness. He 1 John. 1. 5.
is light, and darkness in him there is not any; he Psalm. 5. 4.
delights not wickedness, neither shall evil soiourn with him he cannot so much
as be Iam. 1. 13.
tempted with evil; therefore is he sequestered from this sinful world, and
heaven is the Isa. 63. 15.
habitation of his holiness. 2. Again because he is the only author and
effecter of all holiness and sanctimonie in whomsoever; Lev. 20. 8. John. 17.
17. Jude. verse. 1.
sanctifying us his people, and giving his Sabbath for a Ezekiel. 20. 1^
sign hereof; and Deuteronomy. ^6. 18. 19.
advancing us hereby, above all nations which he has made; this being one of
his principal Deuteronomy. 28. 2. 9.
blessings. He gives holiness to all things about him, to the Psalm. 20. 6.
heavens, and to earthly places where he vouchethsafe Exodus 3. 5. Psalm. 48. 1.
Neh. 11. 1. 18 Rev. 21. 2.
to appear or remayn. So that 1 Samuel 2. 2.
none is holy as Jehovah; he is a Isa. 5. 16.
holy God sanctified in justice, and let Psalm. 145. 21.
al flesh bless the name of his holiness for ever and ay.

2. Jesus Christ has holiness in his divine nature equal with the Father, and
Holy Ghost: and in his manhood he was holy by Luke 1. 35.
birth; in life also and conversation he showed all manner holiness Isa. 53. 9.
John. 8. 46. 1 Pet. 2. 22.
without syn or spott. For such an high priest it Heb. 7. 26.
became us to have, as is holy, harmless, undefiled, and separated from
sinners. And he gives Ephesians. 5. 26.
holiness and purity to his church, for whose sake he John. 17. 19
sanctified himself; and is therefore worthily entitled the Luke 4. 34. Act. 4.
27.
holy one of God, even the Dan. 9. 24.
Holy of holies; unto whom the Seraphim do sing as he sits on ye high
throne of his glory within his temple, Isay. 6. 1. 3. with Ioh. 12. 41.
Holy holy holy (is) the Lord of hosts.

3. The Angels are spirits holy by nature, so created of God at the first, and
having kept their original, are stablished by Gods election through Christ
their Colos. 2. 10.
head, in their holy and happy estate for ever, and therefore carry the title of
Angels 1 Timothy 5. 21
elect and Mat. 25. 31. Rev. 14. 10
holy. Yet even these heavenly spirits, being compared with God himself, the
bottomless fountain of holiness; ar as Job. 15. 15.
impure in his sight and Isa. 6. 2.
hide their faces: though through the grace of God by which they are confirmed,
they always do Mat. 18. 10.
behold his face.

4. Holiness in men, by nature there is not any, for they are Psalm. 51. 5. Isa.
64. 6.
sinners and unclean from the womb; Ephesians. 2. 3.
children of wrath, and rather to be reputed Job. 11. 12. and 24. 5. Ier. 51.
17.
beasts then men: having lost the holiness wherein God at first created them; as
Chap. 2. Sect. 3. 4. etc.
before is showed. But holiness is restored again to men by the Lord; as it is
written Lev. 22. 32.
I The Lord sanctify you: and again, 1 These. 5. 23.
Now the God of peace sanctify you throughout: wherefore he caleth himself, Isa.
43. 15.
the Lord our Holy one.

5. This our sanctification, is ascribed unto the Father: according to the
prayer of Christ Ioh. 17. 17.
Sanctify them with thy truth, and in the epistle of Jude. 1. 1.
^ude, to them that are caled and sanctified of God the Father. It is ascribed
to the Son Ephesians. 5. 25. 26.
who loved the church and gav himself for it that he might sanctify it, and of
God is made unto us wisdom and justice and 1. Cor. 1. 30.
sanctification and redemption; Also to the holy Ghost, as it is written, 1.
Cor. 6. 11.
ye ar washed ye ar sanctified ye ar justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and by the spirit of our God

6. Our sanctification in Christ is two ways; First by imputation of that
which himself wrought for us, when by the will of God we were Heb. 10. 10.
sanctified by the offering of his body once; and thus are we Rev. 1. 5.
washed from our sins in his blood, and God reconciled us to himself, in the
body of his flesh through death to make us Colos. 1. 20. 22.
Holy and unblameable, and without fault in his sight. Secondly, it is by his
own gracious work in us Mat. 3. 11.
baptising us with the holy spirit into his Romans 6. 3. 4. 5*
death, burial and resurrection; that our verse. 6.
old man being crucified with him, the body of sin might be destroyed, and
henceforth we should not serve sin, but verse. 19.
give our members servants unto righteousness in holiness: and so verse. 22.
being freed from sin, and made servants unto God, may have our fruit in
holiness, and the end everlasting life. Both which ways of our sanctification,
were shadowed out unto Israel by blood and by oil.

7. For when the body of that church was purged once a year; the Lev. 16. 15.
blood of the syn offering was sprinkled in the inmost holy place of the
Sanctuary and upon verse 1^.
the altar without, to verse. 16. 19.
^ense and sanctify them from the sin and uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
When the priests were consecrate the Exodus 29. 20 21. Lev. 8. 23 24. 30.
blood of their sacrifice was put upon their right ears, thumbs, and toes; and
sprinkled upon their bodies and garments, that so they might be sanctified:
even as before at the making of the covenant, the people had be^ Exodus 24. 8
sprinkled with blood. The holy Ghost thereby signifiing, how by Heb. 9. 13.
14. 22. etc.
the blood of Christ much more, our consciences should be purged; and therefore
caleth it the Heb. 10. 29.
blood of the testament wherewith we are sanctified.

8. The precious oynting oil, Exodus 30. 23 etc.
made of principal spices, and called verse. 32.
holy, did hallow and sanctify the Exodus 40. 9.
Tabernacle and al therein, the verse. 10.
brazen alter and all his instruments; the verse. 11.
Laver and his foot; the verse. 13. 15.
Priests and their garments, on whom it was Lev. 8. 30. Exodus 29* 21
sprinkled together with the blood of their consecraion, for their
sanctification; and figured out the graces of the Isa. 61. ^.
Spirit, and 1 John. 2. 2^. 2 Cor. 1. 21.
ointment that we have from him that is holy; that Romans 8. 9. 10
Christ and his spirit being in us, the body may be dead because of syn, and
the Spirit life for righteousness sake; whiles the 1 John. 2. 27.
anointing that we have received dwells in us, and Christ as a Song. 1. 1^.
bundle of myrrh lodges between our breasts. Thus are we made an acceptable
sacrifice unto God, Romans 15. 16.
being sanctified by the holy Ghost.

9. The outward means which God uses, for our sanctification, is his truth or
word, as it is written, Job. 17. 17.
Sanctify them with thy truth, thy Word is truth. By this word Romans 10. 17.
faith is wrought in us, which faith Act. 15. 9.
purifieth the heart, Act. 26. 18.
sanctifies the believers, and causes them to Isa. 8. 13.
sanctify the Lord, (as Number. 20. 1^
unbelief makes men that they sanctify him not;) and therefore is worthily
caled the Jude. ver. 20
most holy faith. The Ephesians. 5. 26. Act 22. 16. Mat. 26. 28.
seals of the covenant, do also confirm and help forward our faith and
sanctification; yea even the chastisements of God upon us, have this use and
end, Heb. 12. 10.
that we might be partakers of his holiness. And we by prayer obteyn at Gods
hand, as other blessings, so this 2 Chronicles. 30. 17. 18. 19. 20 1 Timothy 4. 5.
sanctification both of our selves and of al his creatures to our use. Finally,
this grace is conveyghed Romans 12. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 2. 1 Cor. 7. 34.
both into our bodies and into our spirits even into the whole man 1 These. 5. 23
throughout; so great is Isa. 12. 6.
the Holy-one of Israel in the mids of us.

CHAPT. VII.
How the word of God was communicated with Adam and his children and of the
Saints interest in the same.

Forasmuch as the word of God is the John. 17. 17.
truth whereby we our selves ar sanctified, and al 1. Tim. 4. 5.
his creatures unto our use; even the 1. Pet. 1. 23. 25. Iam. 1. 18
immortal seed by which we are begotten and born anew of Gods own will, that we
should be as the first fruits of his creatures; and the sincere 1. Pet. 2. 2.
milk without guile, whereby we are 1. Tim. 4. 6.
nourished and grow in faith: let us take a view of this tresure and tree of
life, which is better to the Saints then Psalm 119. 72
thowsands of gold and silver, Psalm. 19. 10.
sweeter also then honey or ye honey comb, even sweetness to the sowl Prove. 16.
2^
and health to the bones, which if a man keep, he Ioh. 8. 51.
shall never see death.

2. Three ways there are whereby God makes himself known unto me^. The first
is by his works; for the Romans 1. 20.
invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhed, ar seen by
the creation of the world; the heavens Psalm. 19. 1.
declare his glory, and the firmament shows the work of his hands; the
beasts if they be asked Job. 12. 7. 8.
will teach man, and the fowls of the heaven will tell him, the earth will show
him, and the fishes of the sea will declare unto him; for how manifold ar the
works of God? and Psalm. 104. 24.
in wisdomhath he made them al.

3. But because the world by wisdom 1. Cor. 1. 21.
knew not God in this wisdom of God, (though it be enough to make al men Romans
1. 20.
without excuse:) it pleased God of his grace to giv us his word; as a second
and more excellent means of knowledge, by which word he Psalm. 138. 2.
has magnified his name above al; for it is able to make man 2. Tim. 3. 15
wise unto salvation; and he that is of God, John. 8. 47. and 14. 23.
hears that his word, and if any man love him he will keep the same, and the
Lord will lov him again and dwell with him: but they that refuse and put it
away, do Act. 13. 46.
judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life, and that word shall John. 12. 48
judge them in the last day; and for despising of it, Prove. 13. 13
they shall be destroyed.

4. Yet is not the outward ministry of the word sufficient, unless we be also
taught of John. 6. 45.
God himself; who therefore voucheth safe to giv us a third help, eve^ his own
Nehe. 9. 20.
good spirit to instruct us, without which no man can 1 Cor. 12. 3.
say that Jesus is the Lord. By this his spirit God 1 Cor. 2. 10. 12.
reveleth unto us the deep mysteries of his gospel, this Anointing 1 Ioh. 2. 27.
teaches us all things; and that worthy thing which is committed to us, we
keep 2 Timothy 1. 14
through the Holy Ghost that dwells in us. Of whom and our communion with
him, more is to be spoken in due place.

5. The Word of God, (whereof here we entreat,) was given to Adam even in his
Genesis 2. 16.
upright state; to be a law for him to lead his life in paradise. It was again
reveled unto him Genesis 3. 15. 16. 17.
after his fall; to restore him grace and life which he had lost. And not for
himself alone, received he this light; but for all his children, that were
fallen with him into darkness and the shadow of death: wherefore he imparted it
to them, as by Genesis 4.
the sacrifices of Cain and Abel, does appear. Yea God himself verse. ^. 7.
spoke unto Cain, (though he was wicked and without faith,) and gave him
warning of his evil way. Likewise in the new world, the Genesis 9. 1. 8. 9. 11.
etc.
covenant of God was by his word renewed with all Noah's howshold, wherein were
Cham and Canaan, the vessels of destruction. Christ also, the Mat. 13. 3. 4. 5.
etc.
sower of that precious seed, let some fall on the high way, some on stony
ground, and some among thorns; from which places no fruit did grow. And his
disciples were sent to Mark. 16. 15
preach the gospel to every creature, to al nations under heaven. By which
appears the bounty of God, that offreth the word of life unto all, even as
he causes his Sun to shine upon just and unjust: and we are taught, that the
word of God, may not be forbidden to be preached unto any people, be they never
so profane or hethenish.

6. But al people to whom the Act. 5. (...).
words of this life were spoken, receyved not life by them; for the word
profits not Heb. 4. ^.
if it be not mixed with belief in them that hear it. And the 2 Cor. 4. ^.
God of this world has blinded the eyes of many unbelievers, that the light of
the glorious gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine
unto the^, therefore they 1 Pet. ^. ^.
stumble at the word, being vnperswaded; to the which thing they were even
ordained; and the ambassadors of Christ, (to whom he has 2 Cor. 5. 19.
committed the word of reconciliation;) are unto such, the savor 2 Cor. 2. 16.
of death unto death. They Ioh. 3. 20.
hate the light because they do evil, and will not come to it, least their deeds
should be reproved; for wickedness is Job. 20. 12. 13.
sweet in their mouth, they hide it under their tongue, they favor it and will
not forsake it; therefore Job. 24. 13. 17.
abhor they the light and know not the ways thereof, the morning is unto them
even as the shadow of death: so salvation is far from them, Psalm. 119. 155.
for that they seek not the statutes of the Lord.

7. Again, because the word of God is contrary to humane reason, and
condemns for 1 Cor. 1. 20.
foolishnes the wisdom of this world, and calls men out of themselves,
making all the Isa. 40. 6. 7. ^ Pet. 1. 24.
glory and grace of the flesh, to fade as the flower of grass; and leading us
to Christ alone, and him crucified: therefore is the preaching of the cross, to
them that perish, 1 Cor. 1. 18.
foolishnes; they Prove. 1. 25. 30.
despise al wisdoms counsel and correction, and seek after another 1 Cor. 1.
22. Romans 8. 7.
wisdom, and prudence of the flesh, which is enmity against God, and cannot be
subject to his law; and her they follow Prove. 7. (...).
as an ox that goes to the slaughter, and as a fool to the stocks for
correction, though her verse. 27.
house is the way unto the grave, which goes down to the chambers of death,
and her Prove. 9. 18.
ghests are in the depth of hell.

8. And forasmuch as many afflictions do accompany the word of Rev. 3. 1^.
Christ's patience, that on them which receiv it, the Mat. 13. 6. 21.
Sun of tribulation or persecution often arises, and for it they are hated, 2 Timothy 2. 9.
imprisoned Rev. 1. 9. ^* 6. 9.
exiled or killed; so that a man must forsake himself, and Mar. 8. 34.
take up his cross and follow Christ: therefore also many men, ar offended and
ashamed of the 2. Tim. 1. 8. Luke 9. 26.
testimony of our Lord, and will not be partakers of the tribulations of the
gospel; but choos Job. 36. 21.
iniquity rather then affliction, and count it pleasure to live deliciously for
a season, til ease Prove. 1. 32.
do slay the foolish, and the prosperity of the fools destroy them.

9. For when they thus contemn the word; God withdraws from them this favor
and food of their sowles, sending a Amos. 8. 11. 1^.
samine in the land, that their fair virgins and young me^ perish for thirst;
and having caused the Sun to verse. 9.
go down at noo^, and darkened the earth, he lets them walk in their own
ignorance unto perdition, So Cain for his cruelty and contempt, being banished
from the presence of God; we find not the benefit of Gods oracles to be after
vouchsafed him or his, as was unto Genesis 5. 22. 29. and 6. 13. 14. etc.
Seths posterity. The like is to be minded in the children of Cham, Ismael,
Esau etc. Who after they were removed from Gods church, were also deprived of
his word and doctrine, which he continewed and increased unto the people that
of his grace he called and kept to himself as his own.

10. For the light of the Gospel and day of Christ was reveled unto Genesis 1^.
and 15. and 26. etc.
Abram Isaak and Iaakob; and to the Israelites their posterity, did God give
Ex^d. 20.
his law by Moses, and continewed the preaching and opening of the same by
other prophets and ministers; when as the hethens had not this help but lay in
darkness, harkening Deuteronomy. 18. 10 11. 12. 14.
unto witches, soothsayers, sorcerers, necromancers and other like abominable
instruments of Satan which turned to their eternal confusion: when as for
Israel the Lord their God suffered them not so; but Deuteronomy. 4. 36.
out of heaven he made them hear his voice to instruct them, and upon earth he
showed them his great fire, and they heard his voice out of the mids of the
fire; they had ordinances and laws most righteous, to keep and to do, which
was their praise for verse. 6. 7. 8.
wisdom and understanding in the sight and mouths of al peoples. Wherefore
David provokes them again to praise the Lord, who had Psalm. 147. 19. 20.
showed his word unto Iaakob his statutes and his judgments unto Israel, and
had not dealt so with any nation. Paul likewise magnifieth this people greatly,
because Romans 3. 2.
to them were committed the oracles of God; to Romans 9. 4.
them were the covenants and the giving of the law, the service, and the
promises. And this grace was so peculiar to Gods people, that the Law is called
by the Holy Ghost, Deuteronomy. 33 4.
the inheritance of the congregation of Iaakob, as being their proper right
given them of God, as any other possession which they enjoyed: the Saints
again taking his testimonies as Psalm. 119. 111.
an heritage for ever, for they were the joy of their hearts.

11. The drift and scope of all Gods oracles was to call and lead men unto
Christ, and by him to the kingdom of heaven where we might glorify God in our
salvation and life eternal. Our Fathers from Adam to Moses, were quickened and
comforted with this promise. And though Moses gave us a law, which was the
ministry of 2 Cor. 3. 7. 9
death and condemnation by reason of syn that dwells in us: yet even he Ioh.
5. 46.
wrote also of Christ, and foreshewed his crucifying and sufferings for our
syns, in the John. 3. 14. Heb. 9. 7. 8. 9 11. 12. etc.
serpent, sacrifices and manyfold services; yea the law it self was Gal. 3. 24.
our schoolmaister to bring us to Christ that we might be made righteous by
faith in him, in respect of who^ the ver. 17.
covenant was many years before confirmed of God, and could not by the Law that
came after, be disanulled.

12. The hope of salvation for all mankind, was in the promised Genesis 3. 15.
seed: and as God by his word taught men more particularly from whose loins he
should spring; so were they to exspect him if they would have life, and keep
communion with such as should be his Fathers after the flesh. When the woman
Evahs sons were multiplied, and many of them proved wicked; the hope of the
saving Seed, was restrained unto Seth Genesis 4. 25.
set in place of Abel whom the Serpents seed had murdered. Then were all to look
for the Savior from him; and if they sought him in Cains posterity, they
perished for ever. Among Noah's children, Sem Genesis 9. 2^. 27.
had the prerogative, and into his tents must Iapheth (though his elder
brother) come for to dwell and partake of his blessing; and Chams house was
condemned to bondage. After that unto Abraham was the Gal. 3. 8.
Gospel preached that in him all nations should be blessed; and to his Seed
verse. 16.
Christ were the promises made: then who so believed (after knowledge of this
promise) in a Savior to come of any other man; set up an idol in his heart, in
sted of Christ. Among Abraham's offspring, Judah was chosen governor, and of him
should viz. Christ. Genesis 49. 10
Shiloh come, therefore his fathers sons were to verse. 8.
bow down unto him, because of him 1 Chro. 5. ^.
should be the Prince. Of the tribe of Judah, David Psalm. 132. 1^ Act* 2. 30.
Romans 1. 3.
was named to be the father of Christ according to the flesh; then were al to
beleev in David's son, for redemption from syn, and life eternal. In fulness of
time the Messiah Jesus came, and was born Luke 2.
of Marie the virgin, according to the promises: unto him now were al people to
repayr; and so they did both Jews and Gentiles, so many as were ordained unto
life. And if Adam, Noah, Abraham and the other fathers, had now been on earth,
they must have embraced this man for their Savior, and not have sought nor
waited for any other. Therefore the Jews that rejected him, died in their syns,
Ioh. 8. 24.
because they believed not that he was He, and the word of God they had not
abiding in them, Ioh. 5. 38.
because whom he had sent, him they believed not: but many of the gentiles
trusted in him, after that Ephesians. 1. 13.
they heard the word of truth, even the gospel of their salvation; and by faith
became the Luke 19. 9. Gal. 3. 28. 29
sons of Abraham, and heirs by promise

13. And always before, if any of them hethens, hearing of Gods great name,
would repayr unto his people, they there might freely enjoy this heavenly
blessing, to hear the law and promises Deuteronomy. 31. 12
red and taught; and being united with them in faith, had Exodus 12. 48 49.
one law for sacrifice and alother services. Yea many such strangers were in
Israel, in the days of Moses, Exodus 12. 38. Number. 11. 4.
that went with them out of Aegipt; and afterward daily their number
increased, that in Salomons time they were counted and found 2 Chronicles. 2. 17.
a hundred fifty three thousand and six hundred persons. Sometimes also the
Lord sent his word in some mesure, home to their own countries, as by Jonah. 1.
etc
Jonah to the Ninevites; though this was more rare, til the Apostles days, and
then the partition wall being broken down, God imparted again the glad tidings
of his salvation to al peoples, though the Jews could 1. These. 2. 16
not endure it.

14. For Christ though he restreyned this grace a while, saying to his
disciples, Mat. ^0. 5.
Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the cities of the Samaritans
enterye not: yet when he was risen from the dead, he said they should be his

did, and travayled from place to place, til the people to Romans 15. 21.
whom God had not been spoken of did see; and they that had not heard, did
understand.

15. When thus there was one sheepfold made both of Jews and Gentiles, and their
eyes were opened to see the Psalm. 119. 18.
wonders of Gods law, and the glorious mystery of man's redemption, reveled and
published amongal nations Romans 16. 25. 26.
by the scriptures of the prophets: they whose hearts God opened, received the
word Act. 17. 10.
with all readiness, and serched the scriptures daily, taking heed to that most
2. Pet. 1. 1^.
sure word of the prophets as to a light shining in a dark place, til the day
dawned, and the day star arose in their hearts. And though for that word they
found tribulation as others before them, for who^ Christ complained to his
father saying, Ioh. 17. 14.
I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them: yet received they
that word in much affliction, ^ 1. These. 1. 6.
with joy of the holy Ghost; accepting it not as the word of men 1. These. 2. 13*
but of God, and holding it forth as the word Phil. 2. 16.

16. For such is the grace and virtue of Gods word, that it Psalm. 19. 7. 8

as also himself said to his disciples, John. 15. ^.

17. And unto this church has he specially commended and committed those
heavenly oracles, binding up the testimony and sealing up the law Isa. 8. 16.
among his disciples, directing Rev. 2. 1. 7. etc.
his words and writings unto them, and promising that his spirit which is upon
them, Isa. 59. 21.

Deuteronomy. 29. 29. CHAP. VIII.
HOw God by his word, has always called and separated a people*, from
communion with Divils and wicked men; to the fellowship of his grace, by faith
in Christ.

When our Genesis 3.
first parents had revolted from God, forsaken his word the ground of their
faith and obedience, and embraced the verse. 5.
contrary word of the Serpent; whereby they were brought unto syn, and by syn
being finished, unto death: they were estranged from God, verse. 8.
affrayd of his face and voice, ashamed of themselves; and sought to shroud
them among the trees, to hide their shame with ^igleaves, and to excuse their
syn by tra^slating the fault unto others, the verse. 12.
man to the woman, given him of God, the woman verse. 13.
to the serpent; but showed no repentance, neither asked mercy for their
misdeeds, though they were su^moned to the judgment of God. Wherefore, had not
his grace prevented them, they had proceeded on to all manner impiety, as did
and do the Divils, (who^ God has left in their wretchedness;) in whose slavish
subjection, they and we all their children had continued captives, unto
eternal damnation.

2. But God immediately manifested his purpose, according to his election of
grace, by giving to men that were dead in syn, the word of life whereby they
were revived; by which word he called them from Satan's service to his own again
by faith in Christ, who should in time become the woman's seed, and crush that
Serpents head for his chosens sake. He also brake that cursed amity between
men and Divils, and said Genesis 3. 15.
that the would put enimity between them; and not that only, but between the
Serpents seed (that is the wicked men and reprobates, who are named the sons
Deuteronomy. 13. 13 1 John. 3. 10.
of Belial and of the Divil;) and the woman's seed, that is Christ and his
church, even all men and women that should embrace the faith of the woman now
named Evah, that is Living, and the Genesis 3. 20.
mother of all that live.

3. And Adam which had showed that singular faith in Gods promise, by naming
her Adam upon the promise of God caled his wife Evah that is Life.
Life, whom of late he accused to be the instrument of his death: informed his
children in this grace of God; who together with their parents professed one
commune faith and obedience, which also they testified by their service and
sacrifices Genesis 4. 3. 4.
offered to the Lord. Thus he and his house were freed from Satan's bondage by
the word of truth the Gospel which was taught them, and were made 1 Cor. 1. 2.
Saints by calling.

4. But Cain who was the first seed of the serpent, and therefore said in
scripture to be of of that 1 John. 3. 10 11. 12.
Wicked-one, being an hypocrite and without Heb. 11. 4.
faith, for which cause his 1 John. 3. 1^.

2. 19.
of them, and therefore continued not with them. Yea though he were Genesis 4. 6. 7.
warned of God, he would not be amended; but showed the malice and enmity of
his father the Divil, by verse. 8.
killing his righteous brother. Neither then relented he, but added ver. 9.
obstinacy to his bloody act: wherefore he was cursed of God, and fell into ver.
13. 14.
desperation, and condemnation of the Divil.

5. The peace and communion of the Saints, being by that caytiff thus
disturbed and broken; and the deadly war with the woman's seed, by that trump of
Satan thus proclaimed: God for the good and preservation of his Church, cast out
this sinner from his Genesis 4. 14. 15. 16.
presence on earth, (as he had don the Angels which sinned, from the same in
heaven;) and he being separated from the fellowship of the faithful, dwelt a
runnagate in a land of that A runnagate is in Hebreve caled And, Genesis 4. 12.
and Cain was driven into the land of Nod, ver. 16* which took the name of him
and his wof^^ll state therein.
name, and an other seed was Genesis 4. 25.
given to Eve in sted of just Abel decessed. And so the Church of Christ was
propagated, governed by ten faithful Genesis 5.
patriarchs successively; distinguished from the seven Genesis ^. 17. etc.
generations of Cain, as in place and estate, so in name; the one sort called
the children of Genesis 6. 1. 2.
God, the other of men. And whereas the Cainites increased, as well in wickedness
as in multitude: the Lord to keep his people from mixture with them, gave
warning by Genesis 5. 22. Jude ver. 14. 15.
Henoch the seventh from Adam; who prophesied the destruction of them and al
ungodly persons, for their wicked deeds and cruel speakings; when God should
come to give judgment, with ten thowsands of his Saints.

6. But neither his word whereby he admonished his people, nor yet his spirit
which Genesis 6. 3.
strove in them; could restreyn them from being commingled with the profane,
and Serpents seed: for Verse. 2.
they coupled themselves in marriage with their fair women, whereby there sprung
a tyrannous race of Verse. 4. 13.
Giants, by whom the* earth was filled with cruelty. That God seeing how his

the wickedness of man was wexen great, Verse. 6.

warned them again by Genesis 6. 13. 14. ^ Pet. 2. ^
Noah a preacher of righteousness, and by the building of the ark 120. years:
which patience they contemning, God brought the flood upon the world of the
ungodly, and destroyed them; only Noah and his house were reserved, finding
grace in the eyes of the Lord.

7. Yet even in that little family of eight sowles, so wondrously saved in the
water as 1 Pet. 3. 20. 21.
by a Baptism; the Serpent had his seed still, which in process of time was
discovered, in the person of Cham and his posterity and by the Patriarch Genesis
9. 22. 24. 25.

^erah the father of Abram, and Nachor fell to idolatry, and Josh. 24. 2.
they served other Gods, or rather in deed Divils as the Lev. 17. 7. Deuteronomy. 32.
17.
scripture also names them; then God caled 1 Cor. 10. 20.
Genesis 12. 1. Act. 7. 3.
Abram from his country, kindred and fathers house, to go into the land which
he would show him, unto which caling he Hebr. 11. 8.
by faith obeyed, and departed, not knowing wither he went.

8. The Lord who was the caller and Isa. (...). 22.
redemer of Abram, gav him two gracious promises to confirm his faith; as 1.
that he should Genesis 15. 7.
inherit the land of Canaan to which he brought him: 2. and that he should have
heirs of his own seed Genesis 12. 2.
to inherit it after him even a great nation, and one seed specially (which was
Gal. 3. 16. Genesis 12. 3. Act. 3. 25.
Christ) in whom al families of the earth should be blessed. With these
promises, and blessing and ronoume adjoined to them, the Lord persuaded him to
forsake his idolatrous country and communion with idols, and to Genesis 17. ^.
walk before him, who was God the Alsufficient, and to be upright; and gav him
the covenant of circumcision, the Romans 4. 11.
seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had; he gav him also Gal. 4.
21. 23. etc.
two sons, Ismael of Hagar a servant born after the flesh; and Isaak of Sarah a
free woman, born by promise.

9. But he that was born after the flesh, fell to profanenes, became a Genesis 21.
^.
mocker and Gal. 4. 23.
persecutor of the true and promised seed: wherefore he was cast out of the
church, the house of Abraham; and lost the honor of being reputed his Romans 9.
7. 8.
seed, or heyr with Isaak the freeborne, and child of promise.

10. Again, unto Isaak were born Genesis 25.
Esau and Iakob; but God Romans 9. 13.
loved Iakob, and hated Esau; and he also degenerated and became profane; Heb.
12. 16.
sold his birthright and Genesis 27.
lost his blessing, and was Genesis 28. 1. 2^^4. and 36. 6. Josh. 24. 4.
separated from his brother Iaakob, unto whom alone the blessing of Abraham was
derived.

11. Iaakob (whose name was Israel) being willed of God to build him Genesis 35. 1.
an altar at Bethel before he would do it, had a care to purge his howshold of
the false Gods wherewith they were defiled, verse. 2.
who giving him both their Idols and idolatrous jewels he ver. 4.
hid them under an oak at Sichem, for he knew that the worship of God and of
Idols could not stand together. Afterward he went with his family by the Genesis
46. 2. 3. etc.
word of the Lord from Canaan into Egypt, and was a sojourner in the Psalm.
105. 23
land of Cham: where God Exodus 1. 7.
multiplied his church exceedingly, as he had promised to Abraham his friend.
There when the Israelites forgate the Lord their God, and defiled themselves
with the Idols of Egypt: Ezekiel. 20. 7.
he recaled them by his word from those abominations, and verse. 8. 9.
had almost destroyed them for their disobedience. But respecting his own name
and glory, he ceased not to visit them, first by his Exodus 1. 23. 14. and 2. 23.

Charging them, not to do Levit. 18. 3. ^.
after the doings of the land of Aegipt wherein they dwelt, neither to do after
the manner of the land of Canaan whither he would bring them, nor walk in their
ordinances; but to do after his judgments and keep his ordinances to walk in
them, for he was the Lord their God; and to this end had Lev. 20. 23. 24.
separated them from other people, even from among 1. king. 8. 53
al people of the earth did he separate them unto himself for an inheritance.
Wherefore he commanded Deuteronomy. 7 2. 3.
them utterly to destroy those cursed nations, to make no covenant with them,
nor have compassion on them, nor make marriages with them: for they would Verse. 4.

destruction, and willed to abolish al their ^ Verse. 5 also chap. 12. 2. 3.
idolatry with the names and monuments of the same; for that they were an holy
people unto him.

13. Joshua, treating with Israel of serving the Lord in vprightnes and truth,
Ios. 24. 14.
exhorted them to put away the Gods which their fathers had served in
Mesopotamia and in Egypt; and so to serve the Lord, who^ he caleth Verse. 19. 20.
holy and gealous, that would not pardon their iniquity or their syns, if they
should forsake him, and serve strange Gods. And when the people made choice of
the Lord, to serve him; he required them again, Verse. 23.
to put away the strange Gods that were among them: teaching them and us thereby;
that Gods true worship, and the service of Idols, cannot be joined together,
but the one will expel the other. Which law when they kept not, but worshipped
the Gods of the peoples round about them, and so forsook the Lord: Judge. 2.
12. 13. 14.
his wrath was hot against them, and he delivered them into the hands of
spoylers that spoiled them, and they could no longer stand before their
enemies; yea the Lord would no more cast out before them verse. 21.
any of the nations which Joshua left when he died. Again when Samuel
reconciled them unto the Lord; 1 Samuel 7. 3. 4. etc.
he in like manner first procured them to put away their false religion, (which
was the cause of their calamity,) and to direct their hearts unto the Lord, and
serve him only.

14. Neither did this warning of idolatry respect the idols of Canaan only,
but the false religions of all other peoples near or far off, for any other
Exodus 20. 2. 3. 4. 5.
God besides or with Jehovah they might not have or serve. Therefore though they
had no commission to root out any idols save those in Canaan, because that
should be their Deuteronomy. 12. 1.
possession; yet were they to Deuteronomy. 29. 16 17. 18.
avoid communion with all other idolaters; which when they did not, but Number.
25. 1. 2. 3. etc.
coupled themselves with Baalpeor the God of the Moabites, and Hos. 9. 10.
separated themselves unto that Shame, and did eat the sacrifices of Psalm. 106.
28 29. etc.
the dead: the plague of God brake out upon them, and there fell of the
Israelites in one day Number. 25. 9.
four and twenty thousand; even every man that followed Baal-peor the Lord
destroyed Deuteronomy. 4. 3.
him from among his people.

15. And in no better account were the idols and voluntary services of the
Israelites themselves; for God by his word forbad them Exodus 20. 4. 5.
either to make or use any manner idol or similitude upon pain of his gealous
indignation. Therefore when they had made a resemblance and memorial of their
Exodus 32.
God that brought them out of the land of Egypt; and turned him their Psalm.
106. 20
Glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass: then were they
esteemed to have verse. 21.
forgotten God their savior, and Neh. 9. 1^.
committed great blasphemies; and for that Exodus 32. 27 35.
syn many of them died, and al of them verse. 10.
had been rooted out, (with Deuteronomy. 9. 20.
Aaron himself,) but that Moses stood in the breach and by Exodus 32 11. 31. 32.
Deuteronomy. 9. 25. 26. etc
his instant prayer, turned away the Lords wrath from destroying them.

16. Again when Jeroboam the king of Israel had set up signs for the people
to worship their 1 Kin. 1^. 27. 28.
God (as they thought) that brought them out of the Land of Egypt; because
they were in the Lords account but 2 Chronicles. 11. 15.
Divils, and so all that followed them worshipped Satan and not God, yea the
people in that estate were 2 Chro. 15. 3.
without the true God: therefore he ceased not both by 1 Kin. 13. 1. etc.
doctrines and judgments to keep and reclaim his people from them; warning Hos.
4. 15.
Judah not to syn, though Israel played the harlot; and forasmuch as Ephraim
was joined to Idols, they should ver. 17.
let him alone; and not Amos. 5. 5.
seek Bethel, nor enter to Gilgal, nor go to Beersheba, (which were the places
of public worship among them,) but to seek the Lord and they should live,
whereas Amos. 9. 10.
all those sinners of his people should die; even as Ieroboams house for his
syn was 1 Kin. 1^. 34.
rooted out and destroyed from the face of the earth.

17. As the Prophets thus witnessed unto Israel in their several ages: so our
Savior Christ when he came, with his Apostles, first labored to keep and
withdraw the people from the service of Divils and idols, whither more open or
secret. For as he appeared for this purpose 1 Ioh. 3. 8.
that he might loose the works of the Divil, and was that promised seed which
should crush the serpents head: so did he first himself hand to hand Mat. 4.
combat with Satan, resisted his tentations, overcame and put him to flight,
and would not admit of any communion between the Fiends and him, nor suffer
them to say so much as that they Mar. 1. 24. 34.
knew him. He Luke 4. 41. and 8. 2.
dispossessed them of many men over whom they tyrannized, and commanded his
Mat. 10. 1. 8.
disciples to do the like; and ceased not this war, til Satan which had
usurped the princedom of this world Ioh. 12. 31.
was cast out; even to the death did he resist him, and by Heb. 2. 14.
death destroyed him which had the power of death. For though in him the
Serpent could find John. 14. 30.
nothing, yet for his chosens sake he endured al things: till he had spoiled
Colos. 2. 15.
the principalities and powers, and triumphed over them in his cross: thus
teaching us in his own example and person, to hate with perfect hatred that
enemy of God and man; and to know, that there can no concord be, betwixt 2 Cor.
6. 15.
Christ and Belial.

18. Satan being thus Luke 10. 18.
like lightning fallen down from heaven, and his place Rev. 12. 8.
not found there any more, after our Michael had overcome him Luke 11. 22.
taken from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divided his spoils:
many peoples were more easily recovered and drawn out of his snares; who were
all taught by the trumpet of the gospel to prepare themselves to battle
against him, to take unto them the Ephesians. 6. 13.
whole armor of God, that they might be able to resist in the evil day; to
fight the good fight of faith, and by it steadfastly to resist 1 Pet. 5. 8. 2.
that roaring Lion which walked about, seeking whom he might devour: being with
this comforted and assured, that Romans 16. 20.
the God of peace would tread Satan under their feet shortly.

19. But because this Adversary would transfigure himself into an Angel of
light, and his ministers 2 Cor. 11. 14. 15.
also, as though they were ministers of righteousness: the more care and
watchfulnes the Saints were warned to have, least they should be circumvented.
They were taught therefore touching all the hethens religion, that whatsoever they
sacrificed, they sacrificed to 1 Cor. 10. 20.
Divils and not to God; and that Christians might have no fellowship with
Divils, and consequently neither with those idolaters which ignorantly
worshipped such: but must 2 Cor. 6. 17.
come out from among them, separate themselves and touch no unclean thing: for
they could not be partakers 1 Cor. 10. 21
both of the Lords table and of the table of Divils, two such contrary
masters Mat. 6. 24.
they could by no means serve. And if they joined with the wicked in their
worship, or haunted their assemblies; even as in Israel they that did 1 Cor.
10. 18.
eat of the sacrifices were partakers of the Altar; whereby they had part and
interest in the whole worship, and the God worshipped: even so had they with
Satan, that did eat of his sacrifices in his temples; how ever they might
persuade themselves otherwise, because they did know the idol 1 Cor. 10. 19.
and 8. 1. 4.
was nothing. Wherefore they were forbidden al communion with such, and
exhorted to 1 Cor. 10. 14
flee from idolatry, for behold all that are of the fellowship thereof shall be
confounded, Isa. 44. 10.
as says the Prophet.

20. And because this old serpent would creep again into the church and
paradise of God, to seduce the Saints, and set his own throne there: the Lord
Jesus by his Angel certified his In the book of Revelation
servant John, and by him has warned us al, that the Christians also would in
time forsake the true service of God in spirit, and would worship Rev. 9. 20.
Divils; even idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood; being
drawn hereunto by the effectual delusion of Satan in his eldest son Antichrist
the child of perdition; whose doctrines would be the doctrines of 1 Timothy 4. 1.
Divils; whose kingdom should be menaged by Rev. 16. 13. 14.
spirits of Divils, and men drawn by them to battle against God almighty.
Hereupon is that glorious synagogue proclaimed with the loud voice of an
heavenly Angel, to be become the Rev. 18. 1. 2
habitation of Divils, and with an other voice verse. 4.
al Gods people ar willed to go out of her, that they partake not in her syns,
and receiv not of her plagues: for if Rev. 14. 9. 10.
any man worship that beast or his image, or take his mark; he shall drink of
the wine of Gods wrath, and be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy
Angels and before the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment shall ascend
evermore.

21. And as by the word of Christ men were withdrawn from idolatry and
communion with the wicked; so were they also exhorted to draw near to the Lord
and in faith and love to cleav unto him alone: that turning from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan unto Act. 26. 18.
God, they might receiv forgivnes of syns, and inheritance among them which are
sanctified by faith in him. They were therefore Mat. 28. 19. 20. Act. 2. 14. --
38. and 8. 35. - 38. and 10. 36 -- 48.
informed in the mysteries of the gospel, baptized into the name of the Lord in
whom they believed, separated from others Act. 2. 40. and 19. 8. 9.
that frowardly refused, had their Act. 1. 13. 14. 15. and 2. 1. and 12. 12.
and 14. 27.
assemblies for prayer doctrine and other holy exercises, which they were
exhorted Heb. 10. 25.
to co^tinew, taking heed that they were not unequally yoked with 2 Cor. 6. 14.
infidels of the world; nor commingled with open sinners in the church, but to
1 Cor. 5. 9. 11. 13.
cast out the wicked from among them, that they might be jointly a sweet new
lump as they were severally ver. 7.
vnlevened loaves, and so to serve Heb. 12. 28.
the Lord as they might please him with reverence and fear, 1 Ioh. 5. 21.
keeping themselves from idols, and Iam. 1. 27.
unspotted of the world.

22. Thus has God taught us, that all idolatry, whither of Paynims Jews or
Christians, is the worship of Divils: and from it, has in all ages since the
world began, caled his elect; that they shu^ning the society of the Serpent
and his seed, might repair to Revelat. 14, 1. -- 4.
the Lamb that stands on mount Sion, having his Fathers name written on their
foreheads, and follow him whither soever he goes; might walk in the Rev. 21.
24.
light of the heavenly Jerusalem, and there have fellowship with the Lord and
one with an other; to their preservatio^ from death, and the glory of God in
their eternal life and salvation.

CHAPTER IX.
How far we must avoid communion with Divils: and how far with the wicked men.

FOrasmuch as Satan is an open professed adversary of God and men always, and
al his endeavors tend to the Lords dishonor and our destruction; neither is
there any bond of nature or otherwise between him and us that we should have
intercourse with him or seek his good or peace for ever: therefore are we
absolutely forbidden all manner communion with him, in things spiritual or
humane; al which we may reduce unto four heads.

2. The first concerns our faith, that we give no credit to his word as did
our Genesis 3.
first parents, nor admit into our hearts any of his doctrines or damnable
heresies; which are called by the Apostle 1 Timothy, 4. 1. 2
doctrines of Divils: but that we hold fast the word of life taught us of God
in his scriptures only, 2 Cor. 11. 3. 2 Timothy 2. 19. Tit. 1. 13. 14.
avoiding al errors and lies in religion; whither hethenish Jewish or
antichristian; for whosoever be the instruments, Satan Ioh. 8. 44. 2 These. 2.
9. 10. 11. 12.
is the Father of them, and by them does draw men unto destruction.

3. The second concerns our outward carriage, that we do not Exodus 20. 5. Number.
25. 2. 3 Psalm. 97. 7. Dan. 3. 18. 1 Cor. 10. 14 -- 20. Rev. 14. 7. 9. 10.
present our bodies; or by any thing that we have, give Ezekiel. 16. 17 18. 19.
Hos. 2. 8.
maintenance to his worship and service, where or howsoever: but as our bodies
and spirits ar the Lords, 1 Cor. 6. 20. Mat. 4. 9. 10. Romans 6. 13.
so with them both to glorify, and serve him only, and honor Prove. 3. 9.
him with our substance; fleeing al idolatry which is Satan's worship, and
outward communion therewith; and not upon any pretense, either of our own
knowledge and inward dislike of the idol, or the pleasing of others, or winning
them by this means to the faith, or avoiding of our trouble, or presuming of
the mercy of God, or the like, to participate in the service and sacrifice of
Divils. God in his law gav this general precept for his people Lev. 17. 7.
They shall no more offer their offerings to divils; and in the Gospel we have
this instruction, 1. Cor. ^0. 21
ye can not be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of Divils.

4. The third concerns al divilish arts, whereby many me^ have fellowship with
the damned spirits; as Conjuring, enchantment, Witchcraft, ^orcerie,
divniation, charming, necromantie, and al other of the like nature. Touching
which Gods law forbids two things, 1. that no man should himself use any
such cursed craft, many of which are particularly named Deuteronomy. 18. 10. 11. but
man or woman that had such spirits, Lev. 20. 27. Exodus 22. 18.
should die the death: 2. also that none should Isa. 8. 19. Deuteronomy. 18. 14.
seek unto such for instruction or counsel in any matter, for so they should
forsake the living God, and turn to the dead. Wherefore this transgression is
noted for one of the two causes of King Saul's death: that he 1 Ghro. 10. 13 14.
sought and asked counsel of a familiar spirit, (by a witch at 1 Samuel 28. 7 etc.
Endor,) and asked not of the Lord. And as Christ would not Mar. 1. 34.
have the Divils to bear witness of him; so neither would the Apostles suffer a
maid which had Act. 16. 16. 17. 18.
a spirit of Divination to acknowledge them to be the servants of the most high
God, and preachers of the way of salvation. Finally, not only these evil arts
and practisers of them; but all books or writings, or other means which may
nourish the same, are to be shunned and abolished: as the practice of the
Christians, that Act. 19. 19.
burned their books of curious crafts, does teach us.

5. The fourth head concerns Satan's tentations, suggestions, and provocations
unto evil; whereby he daily solliciteth every man unto syn: al which we are
taught of God carefully to 1 Pet. 5. 9. Iam. 4, 7.
resist, giving no Ephesians. 4. 27.
place to the Divil, but by faith to quench Ephesians. 6. 16. 13, 14. etc.
al his fyery darts; and being armed with the whole armor of God to stand fast
in the evil day, and in our prayers to desire Mat. 6. 13.
that we may be delivered from that Wicked one. Herein all the Saints, while
they live on earth, come short of their duty; and too often do admit of
fellowship with the Divil; by reason of the corruption of nature, and infirmity
of the flesh: but by faith in Christ we overcome and triumph, and Romans 16. 20.
shall in the end have full redemption from all these evils.

6. Thus are we taught of God to resist Satan, and avoid al manner fellowship
with him to the utmost of our power: because all his endeavors are against us
for evil, neither can we work in him any good, by any means, at any time. But
the estate of wicked men, is otherwise to be considered; because they and we
are all one flesh and blood; are al placed of God, to live together in this
world, and enjoy mutually his common blessings, as the light of the sun, the
rayn, and fiuits of the earth, and other creatures; besides our civil society
in commonweals: so that we cannot avoid all meddling with them, except we
should go out of the world as 1 Cor. 5. 10.
the Apostle teaches. Also of many of them there is hope, that they may be
co^verted from their evil ways; which by all good and gentle means we should
procure. Howbeit of si^ners there is difference to be made; for some are yet
vncaled to the knowledge and faith of Christ; others are caled, and do profess
one common faith in Christ's Church with us, but walk unworthy of the same; and
some have departed from the faith and obedience whereunto they were come, and
are cast out of the church, 1 Cor, 5. 5. 1 Timothy 1. 20.
delivered unto Satan. Of our special duty to such as being in the church do
transgress, it rests to be spoken hereafter; here I will treat of wicked men
in general.

7 Concerning whom, we are taught of God, not to communicate with them in any
evil action; as not to Psalm. 50. 18.
run with the thief nor partake with the adulterer, not to Pro. 1. 10. 11 14.
15.
walk in the way with those that lay wayt for blood; nor Pro, 23. 20.
keep company with drunkards or gluttons, nor have Ephesians. 5. 11.
fellowship with any other their unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them
rather and avoid them; especially their spiritual and religious actions, as
Psalm. 16. 4.
not to offer their offerings of blood, nor make mention of their names with our
lips, not to frequent their Psalm. 26, 5. 6
assemblies, nor eat of their sacrifices, though they Exodus ^ 34. 1^ Number. 25.
2. Prove. 9. 15. etc.
call and invite us thereto; for even the word of God, and all other holy things
Number. 19, 22 Hag. 2. 12, 14 15. Tit, 1. 15. 16,
are polluted among them, their prayers Psalm, 109. 7
turned to syn, and their sacrifices Prove, 15. 8.
abomination to the Lord.

8. And not in heart and mind alone, are we to mislike and eschew their
idolatries, and other evil actions: but to keep our Romans 6. 12. 13, 1 Cor. 6,
15. 20.
bodies as well as our spirits pure, because Christ has redeemed both, and with
both we must glorify God. We may not therefore ^^r. 5, 7.
swear by their idols, nor Exo, 23. 13. Hos. 2. 17.
make any other religious mention of them with our lips. We may not Hos. 13. 2.
1 Kin. 19. 18. Exodus 20. 5.
kiss them, nor bow the knee, nor do any other sign of reverence unto them.
We may not Cor, 10. 14 -- 20. Hose. 4. 14.
present our bodies at their holy feasts, in their hallowed places, nor suffer
our mouths to Ezekiel. 18. 6. 11. Psalm. 141. 4.
eat of their delicates; much less repayr to any such places for the repast or
feeding of our sowles. We may not either Deuteronomy. 13. 6. and 33. 9,
at allurement of parents, brethren, or most dear friends; or by the example or
entisement of the Exodus, 23. 2. Mat. 7. 13.
multitude, or by the Dan, 3. 14. 15 -- 18. Act. 4. 19.
commandment of the Magistrate, do these or any of these evils: but following
the word of God to 2 Cor, 6, 17. and 7. 1.
separate our selves, touch no unclean thing, cleanse us from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit, and so grow up unto full holiness in the fear of God.
Finally; we may not Genesis 6. 2, Mal. 2, 11, 1 Cor. 7. 39.
join our selves in marriage, with any that are no^ of the same faith and
fellowship with us, in the Gospel of Christ.

9. The causes of this restraynt and separation from the wicked, are. First the
will and glory of God, who to the end we might be his Lev, 20. 26.
has severed us from other people: and upon this condition has promised to 2
Cor. 6. 17.
accept us, and Hos. 2. 20.
marie us unto himsef in faith, that we should giv our selves Mat, 4, 10,
alone to him and to his service, and not run a Deuteronomy, 31. 16 17.
whoring after strangers. And has made this our refreyning from communion with
the wicked, Exodus, 34, 27 with verse. 11. 15. 16.
one express and special part of his covenant with us. Secondly it is for our
own good, least by familarity with the wicked Pro. 22. 25.
we should learn their ways, and receiv destruction to our sowls, as others
before us, Ps^. 106. 3^ 36. Deuteronomy. 4. 3.
by and for like carriage have done. Therefore a^^ we Prove. 7. 21 -- 25. 27,
warned, not to wander in their paths, nor let our heart decline to their
ways; for they go down to the chambers of death: and if we be Rev. 18, 4.
partakers in their syns, we shall receive also of their plagues. Thirdly it is
for the good of those wicked men themselves, (if such be the grace of God
toward them) or for their more certain and just condemnation; that seeing us
to separate from them, 1 Pet, 4. 4.
and thinking it strange that we run not with them unto the same evils; hearing
our reproofs and witness against them; are either Act 2, 37. 40. 41,
drawn to consider their ways and turn their feet unto Gods testimonies, or
else Act 19, 9, and 13. 46. 50 51.
blaspheming, persist and are hardened in their evil course unto judgment.
Fourthly it is for the overthrow of Act, 26. 18. Rev, ^, 13. 2 Cor. 6. 15. 17.
Satan's throne and kingdom, which the words and works of the Saints do beat
down daily, discovering his errors and abominatio^s, keeping themselves, and
drawing others from his deceipts and snares: whereas by 1 Cor. 10. 20 21.
communicating in those evils, they should both honor and advance that enemy;
and strengthen the wickeds hands, that they should not turn from their
impiety.

10. But though we may have no communion with the wicked in their religion, nor
any other evil action, against either table of Gods Law: yet in civil affairs
we are taught of God to converse with them in peace. As to 1 Cor. 10. 27
eat and drink with them, Genesis 23. 3. 4. -- 16.
buy and sell, make Genesis 14. 13.
covenants of peace, 2 Samuel 10, 2.
show Deuteronomy, 20. 10,
kindness to them, pity their estate, Mat. 5. 44.
love them, Pro, 21. 25.
relieve their wants, and Deuteronomy. 23. 4.
receive from them for our relief; 1 Timothy, 2, 1.
pray for them, labor by all gentle demeanure 2 Timothy, 2. 24 25.
to convert them from their evil way, and do any Gal. 6. 10.
good we can to their sowles or bodies, or any thing that is theirs. And if we
live in their policies and dominions, we ought to be Romans 13. 1, 2 1 Pet, 2,
13. 14.
subject to al civil Magistrates high or low, and that of conscience; pay Mat.
22. 21.
the^ their tributes, customs and other like duties for their common wealth;
to bear their exactions, oppressions, persecutions, Mat. 5. 39. Rom, 12. 19.
patiently, without rebellion or resistance; and even pray L^^. 23. 34. A^^. 7.
60.
for them that shall so misuse us: that thus as much as in us lies, we may do
good unto, and have peace with Romans (...). 18
al men, in all things except syn; and be perfect, Mat. 5, 45. (...).
as our father which is in heaven is perfect.

CHAP. X.
How the Saints are called out of themselves, and taught to forsake their own
ways and works, that they may have communion with God in Christ.

FOrasmuch as al me^ bear in their bosoms natural corruptions, bred with them
Psalm. 51. 5.
in the womb, and brought up with them from the cradle, whereby they are al alike
Ephesians. 2. 3.
children of wrath: our separation from other wicked, will little avail us,
unless we be also separated from our selves, and learn to renounce the lusts
and affections, yea even the fayr-seeming works and wisdom of the flesh. For
what ar we the better for avoiding outward pollution by others, if a fretting
leprosy cleav to our flesh and bones, and our Job. 9. 31.
own clothes do make us filthy?

2 To draw us therefore quite out of the miry pit of corruption, the Lord has
caled us from the love and liking of our selves also; as being naturally both
his enemies and our own; teaching us that our wits are 1 Cor, 2. 14,
incapable of his heavenly mysteries, our reason Romans 8, 7.
enmity against him and his Law; our thoughts and purposes Genesis 8, 21.
evil, our affections Ier. 10. 14. Psalm. 73. 22.
brutish, our wisdom 1 Cor. ^. 19, 20.
foolishnes, al our glorious grace 1 Pet. 1. 24,
as the flour of grass: and that therefore we must be turned and become Mat.
18. 3.
as little children; even John. 3. 3,
born again, or else we cannot see the kingdom of God.

3. In matters of religion, we must not do what Deuteronomy, 12, 8.
seems good in our own eyes, nor Esa. 66. 3.
choose our own ways, nor 1 Kin, 12, 33
forge things out of our own hearts, nor Exodus 20. 4.
make to our selves any similitude of things in heaven or earth, nor walk Psalm,
81. 12,
in our own counsels: for what is man that he should invent services of God, or
do any thing which the Lord Isa. 1, 12, Ier, 7, 31.
requires not at his hands. The things of God 1 Cor, 2. 11.
knows no man but the spirit of God; of him therefore we must learn his fear,
what he commands, that only must we do, Deuteronomy. 12. 32
we may not put to it, nor take ought from it. For when Israel set their own
thresholds and posts by the Lords, Eze, 43, 8.
they defiled his holy name with their abominations.

4. The 1 Timothy, 3, 16
mysteries of his faith, we may not measure by John. 6. 52. 60. 63.
carnal reason, or our own shallow understanding; but learn with reverence to
believe all his words; knowing that 1 Cor. 2, 9.
the things which eye has not seen, neither ear heard, neither came into man's
heart, are which God has prepared for them that love him: and neither Mat. 16.
17. John, 6. 45,
flesh nor blood, but himself does manifest them unto us; and as his words are
spirit and life, so is it 1 Cor. 2. 10. Ioh, 6, 63. Ephesians, 3. 3. 5.
his spirit that sercheth al, even the deep things of God, reveleth them unto
us, and quickneth us.

5. The promises which are made us, we must embrace not by sight but by faith
which is Hebr. 11. 1.
the evidence of things not seen. And seem they never so unlikely or
impossible, yet ought we not to Romans 4. 20. 21. 18.
doubt of them, or reason against them through unbelief; but even above hope to
believ under hope: being fully assured that he which has promised is able to
do it. For as Sara received strength to bring forth achild when she was past
age, Heb. 11. 11.
because she judged him faithful which had promised: so contrariwise, the
children of Israel, when God had brought them through the wilderness even Deuteronomy,
1. 19. 20. 21. 26. 32 45. 46. Heb. 3. 19,
to the borders of the land of promise; yet could they not enter in, because of
their unbelief.

6. The commandments of God, how hard or unreasonable soever they seem, we must
readily and cheerfully obey; laying aside al Exodus 4. 1. 2. 10. 13. 14.
excuses, Psa. 119. 60
delays, 1. Sam. 15 24. Ier. 1. 7. 8. 17.
fears, or other things that may hinder us: knowing that all Psalm. 19. 7. 8.
and 119. 128.
his precepts are perfect, righteous, pure, and just. Therefore when God
calls us, we must follow him Heb. 11. 8. Ioh. 21. 19. 22.
though we know not whither we shall come; when he sends us to any place, of
danger, we must go Act. 20. 22. 23. 24. Luke 10. 3.
though we know not what may befall us there; when he commands us a thing,
that is both Genesis 22. 2. 3. Heb. 11. 17, 18.
against nature of man, and promise of God, we must obey without murmuring or
reasoning: yea even to Phil. 2. 8. Rev. 2. 10.
the death must we be obedient, that we may receive the crown of life.

7. In all our trials and tribulatious, we must in faith and patience possess
our sowles. We may not Number. 20. 2. 3. etc. Exodus 15. 24.
murmur, though we want both bread and water; nor speak against God, Number. 21.
4. 5.
though our way be never so grievous. When we be in danger of our foes
pursuing us, Exodus 14. 9. 11. etc.
we must not complain; nor be afraid, Psa. 3. 6. ^ Kin. 6. 15. 16.
when they beset us round about. If God Psalm. 66. 12,
cause men to ride over our heads; if he lead us into fire and into water, if
he give us as Psalm. 44. 11. 1^, 17. etc.
sheep to be eaten, and scatter us among the nations; if he smite us down into
the place of dragons, and cover us with the shadow of death: yet may we not
forget him, nor deal falsely concerning his covenant; but in all these triumph
Rom, 8. 37.
as more then conquerours, through him that loved us. When in our troubles we
exspect his salvation, we must not Isa. 28. 16.
make have, and Hab. 2. 3. 2 king. 6. 33. Lam. 3. 26.
though it tarry, we must wayt; if he hide his face from us, and Psalm. 80. 4
be angry against our prayer, so yt we cry by Psalm. 22. 2.
day, but he hears not, and by night, but have no audience; if he put us back
Mat. 15. 26.
as dogs unworthy of his grace; if he turn himself Job. 30, ^^
to be cruel against us, and to be enemy to us with ye strength of his hand: yet
must we remember that he is the rock of our salvation, and say, Isa. 8. 17.
I will wayt for the Lord that has hid his face from Iaakob, and I will look for
him; Job. 13. ^^
Lo though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.

8, Notwithstanding al these and what soever else we can do or suffer for his
names sake, yet must we empty and cast down our selves before him, confessing
that Luk* 17. 1^
we are but unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do:
and it Job, 22. 3. and 35. 7.
is nothing to ye Almighty that we are righteous, our Psalm. 16. 2^.
weldoing extends not to him. Neither Romans 3. 28 and 9. 11. 2. Tim. 1, 9.
for our works done, or of him foreseen to be done, has he saved and caled us
with a holy caling; but according to his own purpose and grace, wc was given to
us through Christ Jesus before the world was. And because we are al too well
persuaded of our selves and our good deserts, the Lord uses two means for to
humble us; the one is his Law which shows us our syns and infirmities; the
other, Job. 33. 16. 17,
Corrections whereby he opens our ears, to cause us to turn away our work,
and that he might cover our pride; of both these Solomon says Prove. 6 23.
the commandment is a lantern, and the law alight; and correcttions for
instruction, are the way of life.

9. The Law Romans 3. 20,
reveleth our syns which lay hid within us, and shows our weakness to be
greater then we could imagine. For first we are Rom, 7. 9.
alive (in our own conceyt) without the law, and will not stick to say Exodus, 19.
8
All that the Lord commands, we will do. But when he speaks, we Exodus, 20. 19
(...). Deuteronomy, 5. 5
can not endure to hear the law at his mouth, but run away. Or if we do receiv
it, it is with a vail Exodus 34, 30 -- 33.
over Moses face, not discerning the true nature of the Law which is Romans 7. 14,
spiritual, or end of the same, which is to Gal, 3. 24,
bring us to Christ: but in hypocrisy, with hollow and covered hearts,
imagining the outward observation thereof howsoever it be, to be sufficient. But
when it comes in deed to our conscience, we die, Rom 7. 9.
for syn (which we thought was dead) reviveth, and verse. 11.
taking occasion by the commandment, deceives us, and thereby slays us; and
when the law says Thou shall not lust, syn verse. 8.
works in us al manner of lust. And as the Israelites having heard the
thundering voice of the Lord from heaven, forbidding them to have any other Gods
before his face; did before forty days were expired, forget both their Exo,
19. 8.
promise, and their Exo, 20, 18. etc,
fear, and Psalm. 106. ^1
God himself their savior, and Exo. 32. 7, 8,
made them Gods of metal: so is it with us al, when the commandment comes,
syn abounds and Romans 7. 13.
appears to be syn, yea out of measure sinful. And because the wages of syn
is death, the law also Romans 4. 15.
causes wrath, which is Romans 1. 18.
reveled from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. Then are
we cast down with sight and horror of our wretched case; and the more we strive
to rid our selves out of these snares of hell, the faster we are entangled: for
we find our selves Romans 7. 14.
carnal, and sold under syn; so as if we have will to do good, yet Romans 7. 18.
find we no means to perform it; and without Gods grace we can neither
Philip. 2. 13
will nor do. Wherefore we Romans 7. 24.
cry out upon our misery, and should die in desp^yr, were it not that God did
cause his favor in the face of Christ to shine upon us: in whom being graffed
by faith, we Gal. 2. 19. 20.
ar dead to the law, but alive unto God by belief in his son, who has loved
us, given himself for us, and lives in us. Thus is the law, a light to
discover, a fire to burn, a Ier. 23. 29.
hammer to break whatsoever in us is exalted against God, and is Gal. ^* ^*
a scholemayster to lead us to Christ, that we might be made righteous by him,
after that we are stripped naked of our own misconceived righteousness; and having
our Zechar, 3. 4,
filthy garments taken from us, may be arrayed with chan^^ of raiment, even that
Rev. 19. 8.
fine-li^^n pure and shining, which (...) the righteousness of the Saint*

10. The chastisements (...) God, Lev, 26. 39. 40. 41.
ar an other good means to ^umble our stubborn nature, and baptized hearts:
making us to Lam. 3. 39. 40.
(...) and try our ways, and turn (...) to the Lord; to Psalm. 107. 12 13. 17.
18. 19. and. 78. 3^.
cry unto (...) our distress; to have care to Psalm. 119. 67. 71.
(...) and keep his word. By them he Deuteronomy. 8. 2.
proves us, to know what is in our hearts, and lets us have experience both
of our own infirmities, and of his power and grace. By them he brings us to
an humble Job. 33. 19. ^0 -- 27. 28.
confession and sorrow for our syns, and so delivers our sowles from going
into the pit. By them and our weakness in the^, he teaches us to 2 Cor. ^. 8. 9.
trust in him and not in our selves. Thus Pro. 29. (...).
the rod and correction gives us wisdom, and we are chastened for Heb. 12.
10.
our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.

11. And thus God calls us out of our selves, from the unbelief, blindness,
hypocrisy, hardness of heart, pride, wantonness, and all other inordinat
affections that do possess us, that we may beleev, love, fear and obey him
alone; that we may Number. 15. 4^
remember and do al his commandments, and be holy unto our God* He teaches
us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, even such as Iam. 4. 1.
fight in our own members; that Romans 6. 6
our old man being crucified with Christ, the body of syn may be destroyed, and
we serve syn no more. But having Psalm. 131. 2*
our sowles as weanlings with us, withdrawn from all carnal pleasures, and
having Heb. 12. 1.
cast off every thing that presses down, and the syn that so easily compasses
us about; may delight in the Lord and in his law, depending upon him alone for
life succor and salvation; neither dispayring for our evil deeds, nor
boasting of our good, but by faith taking hold upon Christ and saying, Psalm.
7^. 25. 26.
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and I desire none in the earth with thee: my
flesh fails, and my heart, but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for
ever. Then bidding farewell to the world, and meekly taking our cross upon us,
as men Ioh. 12. 25.
hateing our own life here, to ^^^. 14. 4.
follow the Lamb whither soever he goes and shall bring us, to mountains or
deserts, to hunger or thirst, to cold or nakedness, to trouble of body, or grief
of mind, to fears or terrors, or even to the dust of death: knowing that in
all he will susteyn us, and in the end, wipe al tears from our eyes; after we
have gone into fire and into water, Psa. 66. 12.
he will bring us out into a welthie place; in our weakness he will strengthen
us, in our wants he will reliev us, in all our cares, doubts, dangers, and
distresses, he will Psalm. 73. 24.
guide us by his counsel, and after receive us to glory.

12. But these things ar so hard unto flesh and blood, that the natural man
chooses rather to remayn still in his woeful state, and enjoy the momentany
pleasures of syn, then in such streights and difficulties to follow Christ. For
it is a heavy thing to renounce and forsake his own affections, to condemn his
own wisdom for foolishnes, to rest wholly upon Gods word and promises, when
nothing is seen but present want and calamity; to abandon pleasures, to tame
and subdue his wanton lusts, to bear cheerfully the reproaches and persecutions
of the world, and whatsoever else God shall bring upon him; oftentimes to the
lost of friends, wife, children, goods, lands and life it self. Therefore this
state is in deed Luke 9. 23.
a Denial of our selves, and carrying of our cross daily: a Col. 3. 5.
Mortification of our earthly members, even a 1 Cor. 15. 31.
daily dying and Psa. 86. 15.
breathing out of the ghost. As the sacrifices given unto God were Lev. 1. 5.
etc. Ezec. 43. 24.
killed, salted, and sent up in fire; so we that must give up our own Romans 12.
1.
bodies for a living sacrifice, must also be salted with fire, as Mar. 9 49.
Christ has said. And as himself (fulfilling the figure of the syn offerings
which were burnt without the camp,) Heb. 13. 11. 12. 13.
that he might sa^ctify us with his own blood, suffered without the gate of
Jerusalem, so must we likewise go out of the camp, bearing his reproach; which
we never do willingly, til he Song. 1. 3. John. 6. 44.
draw us. For this our new birth, is not Ioh, 1. 13.
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;
who regenerateth, caleth, and sanctifies his Israel, increasing them with men
like a flock; Eze. 36. 37. 38.
and as the flock of holinesses, as the flock of Jerusalem in their solemn
feasts, so fills he desolate cities with flocks of men, which being by the
ministry of the gospel Romans 15. 16. Isa. 66. 20.
offered up for sacrifices, are acceptable being sanctified by the holy Ghost.

13. When thus we be changed by the power of Gods grace, and have got the
victory of our selves, subduing and ruling over our own spirits, which as
Solomon says Pro. 16. 3^*
is better then if we wan a city; when we have hearkened to the cry of the Isa.
40. 6. 7.
Voice that al flesh is grass, and all the grace thereof as the flower of the
field, and when we have found our grass to be withered and flower faded,
because the spirit of the Lord has blown upon it: when the strong hold of our
imaginations is cast down, and every 2 Cor. 10. 5.
thought brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; when we have
discerned our syns, felt the smart of them in our consciences, Lev. 26. 39.
pined away for our iniquities, and Eze. 20. 43
judged our selves worthy to be cut off for all our evils; when we have
renounced al confidence in our selves, rejected all our righteousnesses Isa.
64. 6.
as filthy clouts, and being humbled under the mighty hand of God, do with Job
Job. 42. 6.
abhor our selves and repent in dust and ashes: then will he look upon us
and turn our captivity, and bring us into his promised rest, into which we
Hebr. 4. 3. etc.
entering by faith shall there keep the true Sabbath of God, ver. 10.
cease from our own works as he did from his, and wholly give our selves to
work the works of God, which is Ioh. 6. 28. 29.
to beleev in him whom he has sent, even Jesus Christ our 1 Cor. 1, 30.
wisdom, justice, sanctification, and redemption, who caleth us with a holy
calling from the fellowship of Satan, Syn, this world, and our own corruptions,
to the happy communion with himself and with his Father, by faith a while on
earth; til we Psalm. 17. 15.
shall behold his face in justice, and when we awake, be satisfied with his
image.

O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayct be saved: how
long shall thy wicked thoughts remayn within thee?

Ier. 4. 14. CHAPT. XI.
Of the Communion that we have with God, in general

God having graciously freed us from the captivity of Satan, and caled us out
of the world, and from our own corruptions* does after this take us near unto
him, bestows more graces and blessings upon us, and accepts again the
fruits of his own spirit in us. For he has separated us from others, to 2 Cor.
6. 17. 18.
receiv us unto himself, and he will be a Father unto us, and we shall be the sons
and daughters of the Lord Almighty.

2. This grace God signified to our fathers, when he had freed them from the
bondage of Aegipt, saying; Exodus 19. 4. 5. 6.
ye have seen what I did to the Aegiptians, and how I carried you upon eagles
wings, and have brought you unto me: now therefore, if ye will hear my voice in
deed, and keep my covenant; then shall ye be my chief tresure above al peoples,
though all the earth be mine; ye shall be unto me also a kingdom of priests, and a
holy nation.

3. The manifestation and assurance of this grace, is to be seen in that
eternal Deuteronomy. 29. 12
Covenant and Oath which he makes with us, and whereby he ver. 13.
stablisheth us for a people unto himself, and will be unto us a God; as he also
swear unto our fathers Abraham Isaak and Iaakob. Who were themselves joined in
league with the Lord, that had stablished this everlasting covenant with
Abraham and his posterity, to Genesis 17. 7.
be God unto him, and to his seed after him; but has now fully and finally
ratified in Christ, and by that new Testamental bond confirmed in his blood,
whereby he has covenanted, that Heb. 8. 10.
he will be our God, and we shall be his people: whereupon it follows that he
being ours, and we his, assured hereof by faith in his gospel, we have 1 John.
1. 3.
communion with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ, to the praise of the
glory of his grace, and our eternal happiness. Whiles he being our God, applies
his Pro. 8.
wisdom, Psalm. 18. 1. 2
strength, Psalm. 84. 11.
grace, and al other goodness unto us for good: and causes us again to apply
Rom, 12. 1. 2
our bodies and our minds, with all the faculties of them, to the honor and
service of his majesty; and this with such mutual love, and near conjunction,
as God is said to ^ Ioh. 4. 16.
dwelin us and we in him; and with such peace, as Phil. 4, 7.
passes al understanding, that not without cause does the Psalmist sing, Psa.
144. 15
Blessed is the people whese God Jehovah is.

4. The persons whom God admits into this gracious communion, are al sorts
of people without respect of persons: Gal. 3. 28.
Jews and Gentiles, bond men and free, male and female, Psalm. ^ 48. 11 (...).
etc.
kings of the earth and al peoples, Princes and al judges of the world, young
men and maidens, old men and children, 1 Cor, 1. 26. 27.
wise men and fools; even as Act. ^. 39.
many as the Lord our God shall call. The riches of which grace, Moses also
manifested unto Israel, when he said; Deuteronomy. 29. 10 11. 12.
Ye stand this day every one of you before the Lord your God, your heads of
your tribes, your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel, your
children, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the that is
the basest servants. as Ios. 9. ^3.
hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water; that thou should pass into
the covenant of the Lord thy God, and into his oath which the Lord thy God
makes with thee this day etc. This ample mercy, God showed even then, but has
much enlarged since Ephesians. 2. 11. 17.
by the sending of his So^; that it might be seen how he is Psalm. 145. 9*
good to al, and his mercies over al his works; and that * al flesh might
bless his holy verse. 21.
name, for ever and ever.

5 The original of this grace to the Saints, comes from the election of God,
who having set Deuteronomy. 10. 14* 15. and. 7. 6* 7. 8.
his delight in them to love the^, choseth them and their seed, to be a
precious people to himself, above al peoples upon the earth, and as he says by
the Prophet, Ier. 31. 3.
I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with mercy I have drawn
thee. From which further grace proceeds; for they being thus drawn, do Song,
1. 3.
run after him, and Josh. 24. 15. 22.
chose him again to be their God, and to serve him; Psalm. 119. 30 173.
they chose the way of faith, they chose his precepts. So is there a willing and
joyful covenant made between God and them, by mutual agreement, upon most holy
and happy conditions; which Moses briefly describes thus: Deuteronomy. 26. 17 18. 19.
Thou have (...)
made the Lord to say this day, (that is, thou have taken promise of,
conditioned with, and consequently so the Greek* (...).
have chosen him,) to be to thee for a God, and to walk in his ways and to
keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments, and to hearken
unto his voice. And the Lord has made thee to say this day (has conditioned
with and (...).
chosen thee,) to be unto him for a peculiar people, even as he spoke unto
thee, and to keep al his commandments; and to set thee high above al nations
which he has made, in praise and in name and in glory; and that ^hou should
be an holy people to the Lord thy God, even as he has spoken.

6. The good things communicated with us of God by that covenant of his grace,
the Apostle summeth up, when he says that 2* Per. 1. 3.
his divine power has given us al things that perteyn to Life and godliness.
For as he is himself the Ier. 10. 10.
Living God, and 1 Timothy 6. 13.
giver of life unto al things; so is he Mat. 22. 32.
not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. To the end therefore that we, which
were Ephesians. 2. ^^
dead in trespasses and syns, and Ephesians. 4. 18.
strangers from the Life of God, through the ignorance that was in us, and in
that estate were not his people; might be the Hos. 1. 10.
sons of the Living God, and 1 Pet. 3. 7.
heirs of the grace of Life: it was needful, that we should receive from him
this grace, which else we could not have from any other; because Psalm. 36. 9.
with him is the well of life, and in his light shall we see light; he is Deuteronomy.
30. 20
our Life and the length of our days, his Psalm. 119. 93 50.
precepts and his promises do quicke^ us, and by all Deuteronomy. 8. 3.
that proceeds out of his mouth, does a man live; as that good king Hezekiah
confessed upon his recoverie from death, Is^. 38. 16.
O Lord by them (men) live, and by all of them (is) the life of my spirit; and
thou have caused me to sleep, and have given life unto me.

7. And when we are made partakers of the life of God, then feel we the
fellowship and communion spoken of; and as our life increases, so does our
joy, by the perceiving of our happiness; and we Romans 6. 13.
give our selves unto God, as they that are alive from the dead, Psalm. 56. 13.
walking before him in the light of the living. God also himself Lev. 26. 12.
walks with us, leading us I^r. 31, 9. 12. 14.
by the rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein we shall not stumble, and
our sowl shall be as a watered garden; we shall have no more sorrow, but shall be
satisfied with the goodness of the Lord; Psalm. 22. 26.
our heart shall live for ever. To the end therefore that we may in some sort
discern this incomprehensible grace, let us consider some principal of the many
good things, that God does give us perteyning unto Life and godliness.

8. And first, for that Understanding is Pro. 16. 22.
a welspring of Life unto them that have it; the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory, Ephesians. 1. 17. 18.
gives unto us the Spirit of wisdom, and revelation through the knowledge of
him, whereby the eyes of our understanding are lightened, and we know what is the
hope of his caling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in the
Saints: so he having opened our eyes,, Psa. 119. 18
we see the wonders of his law, and he causes us verse. 27.
to understand the way of his precepts. This is a special point of the happiness
of Gods people, above al peoples of the earth that they have both his Law for a
light, and himself for their instructor, and so are all Ioh. 6. 45.
the taught of God, and have 1 Ioh. 2. 20.
an Ointment from him that is holy, whereby they know al things, and ver. 2^.
need not that any man teach them, but as the same anointing teaches the^ all
things. Hereupon the Prophet said unto God, I have not declined ^ Psalm. 119.
^02.
from thy judgments, because thou did teach me; and himself says unto his
people, Isa. 48. 17.
I am the Lord thy God, which teach thee to profit, and lead thee by the way
that thou should go; and thine Isa. 30. ^1.
ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying; This is the way, walk ye in it,
when thou turnest to the right hand, and when thou turnest to the left. Thus
the Psalm. 25. 14.
secret of the Lord is reveled to them that fear him; and his covenant, for to
giv them knowledge; he Luke 24, 45.
opens their mind, that they may understand the scriptures, he opens unto
the^ the Ephesians. 1. 9. ^ Colos. 1. 9.
mystery of his will, and fills them with knowledge of the same, in all
wisdom and spiritual understanding, that so they may be partakers of his life,
as David says, Psalm. 119. 144.
Give me understanding, and I shall live. And that this grace proceeds from
his covenant, and confirms the same, himself shows when he says; Ier. 24.
7.
I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my
people, and I will be their God.

9. An other of the gifts per^eyning unto Life and godliness, is Faith; whereby
our Fathers Genesis 5. 22. Heb. 11. 5. 6. 39.
walked with God, pleased him, wrought many good works, obtained good report,
and in the end, the salvation of their sowles. This grace we have not of our
selves, Ephesians. 2. 8.
it is the gift of God, who opens Act. 14. 27.
the door thereof unto his chosen people, which therefore is caled Tit, 1. 1.
the faith of Gods elect; and wondrous is the force thereof in our sowles, for
by it Mark. 9, 23.
all things are made possible to us, it is our 1 These. 5, 8.
brestplate, and it is our Ephesians. 6. 16.
shield whereby we quench all the fyrie darts of the Divil; it is the 1 John. 5.
4.
victory whereby we overcome the world; by it we 2 Cor. 5. 7,
walk, whiles we are pilgroms here on earth, and absent from the Lord; by it we
stand Romans 11. 20.
in the grace and favor of God; by it Gal. 2. 20.
we Live, by it our God does Act. 15. 9.
purify our hearts, and through it 1 Pet, 1. 5.
does keep us by his power unto salvation.

10. This Faith, does always respect the word of God, Romans 10. 17.
from whence it arises, and by which it is wrought in us through his Spirit:
which therefore is caled, the ver, 8.
word of faith, and is no vayn word concerning us, but is Deuteronomy. 32. 47
our Life. It looks also unto al Gods oracles, teaching us to beleev Act. 24.
14.
al things that are written in the law and prophets, and John. 20. 31*
in the gospel. It causes us to apprehend Gods ancient mercies showed to our
fathers, as belonging also to us; for so we learn of the Apostles, to apply the
Hebr. 13. 5. with Ios. 1. 5.
promise of Gods presence and continued favor with Joshua; his Romans 4, 23. 24.
imputation of justice unto Abraham; the Psalm. 118. 6. with Heb. 15. 6.
boldness and courage of David, upon Gods assistance; and generally Romans 15. 4.
whatsoever things are written aforetyme, as being written for our learning,
comfort, and increase of faith. So also we learn of the Prophets, which spoke
of things done long before, as if they had been seen and felt by themselves.
Hoseas says of Iakob, Hos. 12. 4.
God found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us; the Psalmist sings of
Gods bringing Israel through the Sea and Iarden, He turned sea into dry land,
Psalm. 66. 6.
they passed through the river on foot, there did we rejoice in him. According
to whose examples, we that now live and beleev, because we have received the 2
Cor. 4. 13.
same spirit of faith with the Patriarchs, and have obtained a 2 Pet. 1. 1.
like-precious faith with the Apostles; may also say with them, Song. 2. 16.
my welbeloved is mine and Iam his; I Job. 19, 25.
know that my redemer lives; and I Gal. 2. 20
live by faith in him who has loved me, and given himself for me.

11. The most excellent fruit that we reap of Faith, is our Justification in
the sight of God, by his grace in Christ Jesus. For whereas two ways of Life
and Justice are set before us in the scriptures, the one by keeping the Law of
the Lord, even al his precepts, of which it is said, Romans 10. 5.
The man that does them, shall live by them; and again, Deuteronomy. 6. ^5.
This shall be our Justice before the Lord our God, if we take heed to keep all
his commandments, as he has commanded us: the other by faith in Christ; as it
is written, John. 3. ^6.
God so loved the world that he has given his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life: the
first of these ways is such, as no Gal. 2. 16.
flesh can be justified by. For though the Law consists of Act 7. 38,
Living oracles, and every commandment Rom, ^* 12.
is holy and just and good; yet by reason of syn that dwells in us, ver. 10.
the same commandment which was ordained unto life, is found to be unto us to
death. For Romans 7. 11.
syn takes occasion by the comma^deme^t, and deceives us, and thereby kills
us; as when the Law says, Thou shall not lust, ver. 8.
syn works in us al manner of lust; so the Law is the life and strength ofsyn,
in us that a^ carnal and sold under syn; and syn ver. 13.
is made out of mesure synful by the commandment, and the Romans 5. 20.
Law entered that the offense might abound. Therefore Gal. 3. 21.
can it not giv us Life, neither was it given to that end, but was added unto
the promise of grace by Christ, ver, ^9.
because of the transgressions; and by it comes Romans 3. 20.
the knowledge of syn; it also condemns and curses Gal. 3, 10.
al syn and sinners, and Gal. 2. 15.
through it are we dead unto it, that we might live unto God. For the terrors
thereof tormenting our synful sowles, we are forced to seek refuge from Gods
wrath in some other, which we can not find Act. 4. 1^.
in any but in Christ, whom God has proposed to be the reconciliation for all
our syns, whom we apprehend by faith; and until faith come ar Gal. 3. 23. 24.
kept fast, and as it were locked up under the Law, whereof we have this
excellent use and benifit, that it is a (...)
child-leader or scholemayster, to bring us unto Christ. In whom the justice of
God is satisfied for all our trespasses by his death on the tree whereon he was
made a Gal. 3. 13*
curse for us, and redeemed us from the curse of the Law. And so our syns which
were imputed unto him, shall no more be imputed unto us, but forgiven for his
sake, and that blessedness comes on us which is written, Romans 4. 7. 8
Blessed ar they whose iniquities ar forgiven, and whose syns ar covered,
blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not syn. Yea God, ^as he imputes
not but pardons syn, so does he impute* Verse. 6.
justice or righteousness to us without works of ours; because Christ fulfilled
al righteousness for us that beleev, and we shall be found in him Phil. 3. 9.
not having our own justice which is of the Law, but that which is through the
Faith of Christ, even the justice which is of God through Faith. To teach us
this, the Abraham. Genesis 15. 6.
first man whom Moses mentions to have believed the Lord; he presently
adorneth with this grace, that God imputed that to him for justice. And he
being made the Romans 4. 16.
Father of al believers; that is written Verse. 23. 24
for us also, unto whom Belief shall be imputed for Justice in like weise. Thus
are we Romans 3. 28.
justified by Faith, without the works of the Law; yea Faith is come in place
of al good works, as Christ has said, Ioh. 6. 29.
This is the work of God, that ye beleev in him whom he has sent; this also is
his commandment, 1. Ioh. 3. 23.
that we beleev in the name of his Son Jesus Christ; whom he that has, 1 Ioh.
5. 12.
has Life, and he that has not the son of God has not Life: but who so Ezekiel.
33. 13.
trusts to his own righteousness, and commits iniquity shall surely die, as
says the prophet. Thus live we by faith in Christ, and that heavenly oracle is
fulfilled, Hab. 2. 4. Gal. 3. 11.
The just shallive by his faith.

12. This Life and grace, is one condition of that everlasting covenant which
our God has made with us, and said Heb. ^. 1^.
I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and will remember their syns and
their iniquities no more. And being thus justified by faith, we Romans 5. 1.
have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he Isa. 42. 6.
has given to be our covenant and our light; he Psalm. 51. 9.
hides his face from our syns, and wipeth away al our iniquities, and says
Job. 33. 24.
deliver them that they go not down into the pit, for I have found a ransom.
Yea now he Number. 23. 21
sees no iniquity in Iaakob, nor transgressio^ in Israel; the Lord his God is
with him, and the joyful showt of a king is among them; though the syns of
Judah be sought for, Ier 50. 20.
they shall be no more found, for the Lord is merciful to them whom he reserveth,
he Isa. 4. 4. and 44. 22. 23.
has washed the filthiness of the daughters of Sion, their transgressions are
put away as aclowd, and like a mist, their syns ar al Mic. 7. 19.
cast into the bottom of the sea. For this, the Saints do triumph and say,
Romans 8. 33.
who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that
justifies, who shall condemn? we will Psalm. 71. 16.
go forward in the strength of the Lord God, we will make mention of thy
Justice, even of thine only. And thus is fulfilled the saying of the prophet
Isa. 45. 25.
The whole seed of Israel shall be Justified, and glory, in the Lord.

13. Yet is their also further grace perteyning to life and godliness given us
of God, even our Sanctification; whereunto he has 1. These. 4. 7.
caled us, and which we attayn unto Act. 26. 18.
by faith in Christ. For the grace of God, that brings salvation unto al men,
and has appeared; does Tit. 2. 11. 1^
teach us that we should deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and that we should
live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world, and not Romans 6. 1.
continue still in syn, that grace may abound. We are the people of Isa. 63.
18.
Gods holiness, and he will be Levit. 23. 32.
hallowed among us, he the Lord does sanctify us; he powers Ezekiel. 36. 25
clean water upon us that we may be clean, Heb. 10. 22
sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience, and washed in our bodies with
pure water; he Ezekiel. 35. 26
takes away the stony heart out of our body, and gives us an heart of flesh, he
verse. 27
puts his spirit within us, and causes us to walk in his statutes, to keep
his judgments and do them, that we be Ezekiel. 37. 23
polluted no more with our abominations, nor any of our transgressions; and
says unto us Levi. 19. 2.
ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. And this is an other
condition of his gracious covenant with us, as it is written, Heb. 8. 10.
I will put my laws in their mind and in their heart I will write them, and I
will be their God, and they shall be my peaple.

14. Of this Sanctification there be two parts, which they that long after Life
and to see good days, must seek; 1 1. Pet. 3. 10 11
to eschew evil, 2 and to do good. The way to attayn these, is by the Romans 6.
3. 4. 6.
death and burial of the old man, the corruption of nature; and the
resurrection of the new: that so being verse. ^^
dead unto syn, we may be alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord. The old man
or body of syn, is the Ioh. 3. 6. 3.
whole man sowl and body, as he is born by nature, even Isa. 40. 6. 7 1 Pet. 1.
24.
al flesh, and all the grace and glory thereof, which the Spirit of the Lord must
blow upon, and cause to fade as the flower of grass, that the man may be born
again, and made a new creature, even born Ioh. 1. 13.
of God. To work this wondrous change in us; the Lord gives two special
graces, the 1 Fear and 2 Love of his name; by the one to restreyn us from evil,
and by the other to allure us unto good.

15. The Fear of the Lord, as it is the Psalm. 111. 10
beginning of wisdom; so (...) did David's) Psalm. 119. 120*
for fear of the Lord, and we being afraid of his judgments. His mercies also
are showed us to this end, as it is written, Psa. 130. 4
Mercy is with thee that thou may be feared. This grace God gives to his
Saints, to humble them, that they be Romans 11. 20
not high-minded, but may walk in reverence before him, and their hearts be Pro.
23. 17
in his fear continually, that Deuteronomy. 5. 29
it may go well with them and with their children for ever; for he that Pro. 13.
13
fears the commandment shall be rewarded. By this grace have his people
commuinon with him, and feel his goodness, for Psalm. 33. 18
the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and trust in his mercy; Ps.
147. 11
he delights in them, he will fulfill Ps. 145. 19.
the desire of them, and nothing Psalm. 34. 9
shall be wanting unto them, as he has promised by his prophet; Psalm. 25. 13 14.
their sowles shall dwell in good, their seed shall inherit the land, and the
secret of the Lord, and his covenant shall be revealed unto them. Wherefore unto
man he says, Job. 28, 2^
Behold the Fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is
understanding; Pro. 22. 4.
the reward of humility and the fear of God, is riches and glory and Life. Unto
this therefore let us take heed, for in it Pro. 14. 26
is an assured strength; by it we shall Ecel. 7. 20. 18. 19.
come out of al extremities that are either too much or too little; and to Eccl.
12. 13
fear God and keep his commandments is the whole man; this leads him Pro.
19. 23*
unto Life, and being filled therewith, he shall continue and not be visited with
evil: that he may know, that Isa. 33. ^*
the fear of the Lord is his tresure, as says the Prophet.

16. But because the end of the Commandment, is 1 Timothy 1. ^^
Love, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience and of faith vnfeighned,
and Love is the Romans 13. 16
fulfilling of the Law: therefore has God comprised his whole will touching our
Sanctification and obedience in two precepts, 1 Thou shall Mat. 22. 37
Love thy Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy sowl, and with all thy
mind; and 2 Thou shall verse. 39.
Love thy neighbor as thy self; on verse. 40.
these two commandments hangs the whole Law, and the Prophets. As evil
therefore is to be Psalm. 97. 10
hated and eschewed, so that which is good ought Amos 5. 15.
to be loved, and Romans 12. 9.
cleaved unto: the head and fountain of al which good, is only Luke 18. 19
God himself; who first is to be loved, and above all; but has given us this
commandment, 1 Ioh. 4. 21
that he which loves God, should love his brother also.

17. And as we have of him this Law of love, so have we from him the grace to
love both him and his law, and shall from him receive the fruit thereof which is
Life. This Moses showed Israel of old, saying, Deuteronomy. 30. 6
The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed, that thou
may Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy sowl, that thou
may Live. Thus we love him, 1 Ioh. 4. 19
because he loved us first, and has inclined our hearts and drawn us after him.
Again because as Christ says, Ioh. 14. 29
he that has his commandments and keeps them, is he that Loves him;
therefore have we this rule and direction given us by Moses further, joining
these two togeither, Deuteronomy. 11. ^
Thou shall love the Lord thy God, and shall keep that which he commands to
be kept; that is, his ordinances and his laws and his commandments always.

18. From this arises much comfort to the Saints, which finding themselves
affected with the Lov of God, and feeling his love Romans 5. 5.
shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost which is given unto the^, do grow
in this grace, and Jude. 21.
keep themselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ unto eternal life. They Psalm. 119. 127.
lov his commandments above the finest gold, and therefore have verse 165.
much peace, and shall have no hurt or scandal; their verse. 47.
delight is in his commandments which they have loved, their verse. 48.
hands also do they lift up unto them; and hereupon do expect to be verse. 159.
quickened and conserved in life according to the loving kindness of the Lord,
who Psalm. 145. 20.
preserves al them that love him, Dan. 9. 4.
keeps covenant and mercy toward them, and causes al things to Romans 8. 28.
work together for the best unto them. For God 1 Ioh. 4. 16
is Love (as says the disciple Ioh. 21. 20. 24.
whom Jesus loved,) and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in
him; and Ephe. 6. 24.
grace shall be unto al them that love him, unto immortality. Moses in spirit
foreseing this, said unto Israel; Deuteronomy. 30. 19. 20.
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before
you Life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose Life that thou
and thy seed may live; by loving the Lord thy God, by obeying his voice, and by
cleaving unto him; for he is thy Life, and the length of thy days.

19. But because our Life Col. 3. 3.
is hid with Christ in God, and though now we be the sons of God, 1 John. 3.
2.
yet it does not appear what we shall be, but when Col. 3. 4^*
Christ which is our Life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in
glory, be like unto him, and see him as he is: therefore has he given us
another grace perteyning to Life and godliness, called 1. Pet. 1. 3.
a living Hope, unto which God of his abounda^t* mercy has begotten us by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. This virtue respects our good
that is to come, our verse. 4.
inheritance reserved for us in heaven, yea thither has it power to come,
entering (as the Apostle says) Heb. 6. 18. 19, 20.
into that which is within the vail, whither the forerunner Jesus is for us
entered in, and this Hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and
steadfast, holding it fast in all tempests of tribulations or tentations, knowing
(as Solomon says) that Prove. 24. 14.
there is an end, and our hope shall not be cut off.

20. There be two companions and as it were sisters of this grace; 1 Faith and 2
patience; Faith goes before as the guide and susteyner, being the (...). Heb.
11. 1.
subsistence or ground of things hoped for; as Abraham by faith, even Romans 4.
18.
above hope, believed under hope; Patience accompanies it, and teaches to
wayt, as it is written, Romans 8. 25.
if we hope for that we see not, we do with patience abide for it. And thus is
fulfilled that which Isaias says, Isa. 28. 16.
he that believes shall not make have, and consequently, shall not 1. pet. 2. 6.
be ashamed; but being assured that Heb. 10. 37.
he which shall come will come, and will not delay, Hab. 2. 3.
though he tarry yet we wayt, as the prophet bids us, because the Father
which has loved us, has 2. These. 2. 16.
given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace; and hope Romans 5.
5.
makes not ashamed; yea we Romans 12. 12
rejoice in hope, as being the thing whereby Romans 8. 24.
we are saved, and he which is the Romans 15. 13*
God of hope fills us with all joy and peace in believing, and causes us to
abound in hope, through the power of the holy Ghost.

21. One of the special promises which the anchor of Hope lays hold upon, and
that by reason of the Covenant of God with us, is the Resurrection of the Dead.
For as God caling himself the Exodus 3. 6.
God of Abraham Isaak and Iaakob, when they were dead unto the world, but Living
unto him, did teach his people thereby, that he would raise them up again from
death, as our Savior Luke 20. 37. 38.
expounds his Fathers oracle: even so we all that are in the same covenant of
grace, and have him for our God, do beleev that after our flesh has been sown
in dishonor, and seen corruption, it 1 Cor. 15. 43
shall be raised in glory by the power of God; for in our graves, Ioh. 5. 28. 29
we shall hear the voice of Christ at his appearing, and shall come forth unto
the resurrection of Life. And then shall we enjoy all the good promises in that
City Heb. 11. 10.
which has foundations, whose buylder and maker is God, who is not ashamed of
us to be called our God, because Heb. 11. 16.
he has prepared for us a city.

22. Thus have we through the grace of our God, those three heavenly virtues
mentioned by 1 These. ^. 3.
the Apostle; 1 an effectual Faith, 2 adiligent Love, 3 and the patience of
Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ; by Faith to beleev the mysteries of life and al
his word; by Love to cleav unto him and keep his commandments; by hope to
exspect the fulfilling of al good promises which God that cannot lie has made
unto us; and these three things do 1 Cor. 13. (...).
abide with us during this present life, that walking in them, we may have
fellowship with the Lord in spirit, who having thus decked us with the garments
of beauty and glory, with mercy and salvation through faith in his name, does
then Ephesians. 1. 13. 14.
seal us with that holy spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our
inheritance, until the redemption of the possession purchased, (the full
redemption of al Saints,) unto the praise of his glory. For as he has verse. 4.
chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy
and without blame before him in love: so having effectually caled justified and
sanctified us of his unspeakable grace, he gives us also certainty and
assurance of 2. Pet. 1. 10
our election, that we shall never fall from, nor be forsaken of him. For the
seed wherewith we are born anew, is an 1. Pet. 1. 23
immortal seed, which can never die, and this seed 1. Ioh. 3. 9.
remains in us, to keep us from syn: and if we syn, we have an 1. Ioh. 2. 1.
advocate with the Father, even Jesus Christ the just, who makes intercession,
and prays for us that our Luke 22. 3^.
faith fail not; he also gives us repentance Act. 11. 18.
unto Life, and works in us godly sorrow for our misdeeds; so we are renewed by
repentance daily, and revived by faith, knowing that God has ^ Sam. 7. 24*
stablished to himself his people Israel, to be his people for ever, and he is
their God, his gifts and caling are Romans 11. ^9
without repentance; he that has begun his good work in us, will Phil. 1. 6.
perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ; for he has made an Ier. 32. 40.
everlasting covenant with us, that he will never turn away from us to do us
good, and has put his fear in our hearts, that we shall never depart from him;
and has said concerning us by his prophet, Joel. 2. 26. 27.
My people shall never be ashamed. Thus the 1 These. 5. 8.
hope of salvation, is for an helmet upon our heads; for that God has ver. 9.
not appointed us unto wrath, but to obteyn salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ;
and we rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, being persuaded Romans 8. 38 39
that neither death nor life nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us fio^ the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.

23. Our God it is wc thus 2 Cor. 1. 21. 22.
stablisheth us in Christ, and has anointed us, and also sealed us, and given
us the earnest of his spirit in our hearts, even the spirit of adoption whereby
we cry unto him Romans 8. 15.
Abba Father; and of us he says, Isa. 43. 21.
This people have I formed for my self, they shall show forth my praise. And
being thus furnished with his graces, we find and feel the sweetness of that
fellowship and communion, that we have with him in Christ Jesus and by his
Spirit.

24. This communion the scripture sets down by similitude of walking and
dwelling together. For God has promised Lev. 26. 12*
I will walk among you, and I will be your God and ye shall be my people; and for
his habitation, although Ior. 23. 24.
he fills heavens and earth, and the 1 Kin. 8. 27.
heavens of heavens are not able to co^teyn him, being considered in his
infinite majestye: yet abaseth he himself to converse with us that dwell in
houses of clay, as he says by the Prophet, Isa. 57. 12.
I dwell in the high and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite and
humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble, and to give life to them that
are of a contrite heart. Which grace that all the Saints might take knowledge
of, the voice is written which was heard out of heaven to say, Rev. 21. 3.
Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they
shall be his people, and God himself will be their God with them. This
Tabernacle is the bodies and sowles of the Saints, as the Apostle says, 2
Cor. 6. 16.
Ye are the Temple of the Living God, even as God has said, (...)
I will dwell in the^, and walk (with them:) 1 Cor. 6. 10.
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. On the other side, we are said to
walk with God, as did Genesis 5. 24. and 6. 9.
Enoch, and Noah, and as the Lord requires of every man that Mic. 6. 8.
he humble himself to walk with his God; we Psalm. 61. 4.
dwell in his tabernacle for ever, our trust is under the covering of his wings,
and as the Apostle John says, 1 Job. 3. 24.
He that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him.

25. This grace is so heavenly and supernatural, as it cannot be comprehended
by the carnal man; nor embraced and walked in with comfort by sinners and
hypocrites. The natural man thinks D^^. 2. 11.
the dwelling of God is not with flesh; the unbelieving among the Saints, in
day of their distress do say, Exodus 17. ^*
Is the Lord among us or no? The sinners and hypocrites (...) Sion, are afraid
saying, Isa. 33. 14.
who among us shall dwell with the devouring sire? who among us shall dwell with
the everlasting burnings? And indeed ye throne of iniquity Psalm. 94. 20.
has no fellowship with him; but ye pure of heart edure as Heb. 11. 27.
seeing him who is invisible; they sing, Psalm. 46. 7.
The Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Iaakob is our refuge; they serve him
and Rev. 22. 4.
see his face, his name is on their foreheads, and they say, Psalm. 73. 28.
It is good for us to draw near unto God; Psalm. 4. 6.
Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us.

26 This conversing of the Saints with God is spiritual and mystical; we walk 2
Cor. 5. 7.
by faith and not by sight; faith which is the Heb. 11. 1.
evidence of things not seen. He that is joined to the Lord 1 Cor. 6. 17.
is one spirit says the Apostle. Again Gods walking with us is strange and
uncouth to the world; for he brings us into many tribulations; his way Psalm.
77. 19
is in the sea, his paths in the great waters, and his footsteps are not known;
he leads us through the wilderness, through a desert and wast land, Ier. 2. 6.
and by the shadow of death; where Deuteronomy. 8. 15.
fyry serpents are, and scorpions, and drought, without water; ver. 2.
to humble us and to prove us, to know what is in our heart, that he may verse.
16.
do us good in the latter end; he brings us through Zach. 13. 9.
the fire, and fineth us as the silver is fined, and tries us as gold is
tried; and yet he says It is my people, and we do say, The Lord is our God.

27. And hence arises, the comfort of our hearts, that always we behold God
with us, yea feel him within us; and answer Amen by faith to al his promises.
He says Isa. 41. 10.
Fear not for I am with thee, be not afraid for I am thy God; we say again,
Psalm. 23. 4.
Though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil, because thou art with me. He says of every of his Saints, Psalm. 98. 15.
I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and glorify him; they testify
and say; Act. 2. 2^.
I beheld the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I should
not be shaken; Isa. 8. 9. 1^.
gather together on heaps o ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces, take
counsel together, yet shall it be brought to naught, pronounce a decree, yet
shall it not stand, for God is with us. The Patriarchs moved with envy, sold
Joseph into Egypt, but Act. 7. 9. 1^.
God was with him (says the scripture,) and delivered him out of al his
afflictions. To Iakob God said, Genesis 31. ^.
turn again to the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I ^ilbe with
thee; in his return, he was in danger and prayed, Genesis 32. 9.
o God of my father Abraham etc, Lord which said est unto me return to thy
country and kindred, and I will do thee good. Thus always ye Saints assure
themselves of good by Gods presence with the^, and of shelter from evil; and
count them selves naked and helpless when he withdrawes his face; as when in
displeasure he had moved his Tabernacle Exodus 33. 7.
far off from the host of Israel, and seemed as if he would have walked no
further with them; then Moses said, ver. 15. 16.
If thy presence go not with us carry us not hence; and wherein now shall it be
known that I and thy people have found favor in thy sight? shall it not be when
thou go with us? so I and thy people shall have preeminence before all people
that are on the earth. Finally, as the Saints encourage themselves against
their foe^ with this, Number. 14. ^.
their shadow is departed from them, and the Lord is with us, fear them not: so
God foretold that when many tribulations should come upon his people, they then
would say, Deuteronomy. 31. 17
Are not these troubles come upon me, because my God is not with me?

28 For the presence of God, and communion of his graces, so saves his Saints
out of al adversities; that no wisdom counsel or strength of any enemy can
hurt, no creature can hinder them from their happiness; the Lord their God Deuteronomy.
1. 3^.
who goes before them, he fights for them, and Deuteronomy. 33. 2^
rides upon the heavens for their help* the eternal God ver. 27.
is their refuge, and under his arms they are for ever, he casts out the
enemy before them and says, Destroy; so as wax melts from the presence of
the fire, Psalm. 68. ^^
the wicked perish from the presence of God; But his people he Psalm. 41. 12.
vpholdeth in their integrity, and does set them before his face for ever,
both they and Psa. 102. 28
their seed shall stand fast in his sight; for they are his Deuteronomy. 32. 9.
portion or inheritance, and they shall Psalm. 89. 15.
walk in the light of his countenance, he leads them with his own glorious
arm, Isa. 63. 12.
dividing the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name; he
says, Isa. 57. 14.
prepare the way, take up the stumbling blocks out of the way of my people, so
causes he them to Lev. 26. 13.
go upright, giving Isa. 40. 29.
strength unto him that faints, and multiplying might to him that has no
power, and they ver, 31.
renew strength, they lift up the wings as the eagles, they run and are not
weary, they walk and faint not. He supply(...) their wa^ts, Psalm. 107. 9.
filling the hungry sowl with good, and satisfying the soul that thirsts
after Mat. 5. 6.
righteousness; for righteousness Psalm. 85. 1^.
goes before him, and sets her steps in the way; he Isa. 46. 130
brings near his justice, it is not far off, and his salvation shall not
tarry, for he gives it in Sion, and his glory unto Israel.

29. And they again, being a people in Isa. 51. 7^
whose heart is his law, and knowing that two cannot walk together (as says
Amos. 3. ^0
the prophet,) except they be agreed; labor by faith to have peace with him,
and to walk before him in vprightnes, to walk Col. 1. 10.
worthy of him, and please him in all things, being fruitful in all good works,
and increasing in the knowledge of God. For this they have Deuteronomy. 26. 17 18.
promised unto him when they entered into his covenant; and therefore are their
sowles delivered from death, Psalm. 116. 80 9.
that they may walk before the Lord in the land of the living. And because to
walk 1 Kin. 8. 25 with 2 Chro* 6. 16.
before God, is to walk in his Law, (as the scripture teaches;) therefore Psa.
119. 97
love they the law of the Lord, it is their meditation continually, and it is
written upon 2 Cor. 3. 3.
the table of their heart; their delight is Psalm. 119. ^7. 48.
in his commandments which they have loved, their hands also do they lift up
unto them, their mouth ver. 46.
talks of them, their feet ver. 32.
run in them, their ver. 167.
soul keeps them, and they will ver. 93.
never forget them; al their members are given up as Romans 6. 13. 17.
instruments of righteousness to serve and please the Lord, and they Psalm. 119.
112.
apply their heart to fulfill his statutes always even unto the end. Thus their
Isa. 58. 8.
righteousness goes before them, and the glory of the Lord embraces the^, he
Zach. 10. 12.
strengthens the^ in the Lord, and they walk in his name, their hearts being 1
These. 3. 13
stable and unblameable in holiness before him, and there is no Romans 8. 1.
condemnation unto them, for that they are in Christ Jesus, and walk not after
the flesh but after the spirit.

30. And now they eat their bread Eccl. 9. 7.
with joy, and drink their wine with a cheerful heart, because God accepts
their works, Psalm. 19. 14.
the words of their mouths, and the meditation of their hearts. They please him
and have his blessing even in their civil affairs and Psalm. 1^8.
handy labors: the world and 1 Cor. 10. 25 26.
al earthly creatures are subdued unto them, and they use them for their
service and comfort in the Lord; if they Romans 14. 6.
eat, it is to the Lord, if they eat not it is to him also, giving God thanks,
and doing al things that they do, 1 Cor. 10. 38
unto his glory. So though they be in the world, yet are they not Ioh. 17. 14.
of the world, and though they 2 Cor. 10. 3.
walk in the flesh yet war they not, neither Romans 8. 1.
walk they after the flesh; but being on earth, their Phil. 3. 20.
conversation is in heaven, and the way of Life is Pro. 15. ^4.
on high unto them, to avoid from hell beneath. They seek the Lord and his
strength, they Psalm. 105. 4.
seek his face continually, and with Psalm. 21. 6.
the joy of his face he makes them glad, and in the Psalm. 31. 20.
secret thereof, he hides them from the pride of men, he keeps them Deuteronomy. 32.
10.
as the apple of his eye. He says unto them, Psalm. 78. 1.
Hear my law o my people, incline your ears to the words of my mouth, Ier. 11.
4.
obey my voice and do al things which I command you, so shall ye be my people,
and I will be your God: they answer, al peoples Mi^. 4. 5.
will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of
our God for ever and ever; teach us thy way o Lord, Psalm. 16. 11.
and we will walk in thy truth, knit our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy
name, Thus hoping for his glory which is to be reveled, they 1 John. 3. ^.
purge themselves as he is pure, and walk in the light, 1 Ioh. ^. 7.
as he is in the light, having fellowship one with another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ his Son clensing them from al syn. And the Lord Psalm. 29. 1^.
gives strength unto his people, the Lord blesses his people with peace; he
is as Hos. 14. 6.
the dew unto the^, they grow as lilies and fasten their roots as the trees of
Lebanon, dwelling under his shadow ver. 8.
they revive as the corn and flourish as the vine, and still Psalm. ^2. 1^
bring forth fruit even in their hoary age, and God is their guide even unto the
death. Yet then forsakes he the^ not; but as when they lived, they lived unto
him, so now when they die, they Rom, 14. ^.
die unto him and are his; peace comes, and Isa. 57. ^0
they rest in their beds, every one that walks before him, til their changing
shall come, and they be translated from death to life, to see the king in his
glory, even God as he is, and to be satisfied with his image.

31. For notwithstanding all this grace, and communion that we have with God by
faith; we are not perfect, neither shall be, til we have attained Phil. ^. 12.
the resurrection of the dead: here 1. Cor. 13. 12
we see through a glass darkly, and not face to face, we know in part only,
and do grow in grace and knowledge daily; we behold the, glory of the Lord
with open face, but 2 Cor. 3. 18
as in a mirror, and ar changed into the same image from glory to glory as by
the Spirit of the Lord. We have first our infancy, and are 1. Cor. 3. 1. 2
as babes in Christ; after we are as 1. Ioh. 2. 14.
young men strong in faith, and do overcome the wicked one; and proceed in
riper years, wexing old in faith, and knowledge of him which is from the
beginning: thus our way shines as the morning light, Prove 4. 18.
that shines more and more unto the perfect day; and we walk on earth, as did
Abram in Canaan, Genesis 12. 9.
going and iourneying toward the South.

32. But of all the ways and means, whereby we have communion with God, there is
none more lively, powrful and comfortable then Prayer; whereby we converse with
the Lord most nearly, power out our complaints as children into the bosom of
their father, and praise his name; ar heard and answered of him to ye glory of
his grace, ye joy of our hearts, and the increase of our faith, with all virtues
and fruits of the Spirit.

33. The ground of this heavenly exercise, whereby man is so bold as to come
unto the throne of grace, and talk with God, is his commaundment which says, *
Call upon 1 Psalm. 50. 1^0
me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me; Ier.
33. 3.
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee groat and mighty things
which thou know not. Moreover he wills us to Phil. 4. 6.
be nothing careful, but in all things to let our requests be showed unto him,
in prayer and suppplicatio^; with giving of thanks; yea 1. These. 5. 17 18.
to pray continually, and in all things to giv thanks, because this is the will
of God in Christ Jesus toward us.

34. To guide us in this action, he has given us outward instruction Mat. 6.
5. 9 etc.
in his word, that we may ask according to his will; with assurance, that 1.
Ioh. 5. 14 15.
whatsoever we so ask, he hears us, and we have the petitions that we desire
of him. He gives us also inward assistance by his Spirit which Romans 8. 9. 1
Verse. 15.
dwells in us, and is the Spirit of the adoption-of-sons whereby we cry Abba
Father; which spirit Romans 8. (...)*
also helps our infirmities, (who know not what to pray as we ought,) and it
self makes requests for us with sighs and groans unutterable. Thus pouring
out upon his people (as he did promise,) Zaeh. 12. 10.
the spirit of grace and of (...)
supplications, and furnishing them with gifts for this heavenly work, he
hears and grants their requests, as David says Psalm. 10. 17.
Lord thou hear the desire of the poor, thou preparest their heart, thou
bendest thine ear.

35. So when we call upon the Lord in our trouble and cry unto our God, Psalm.
18. 6*
he hears our voice out of his temple, and our cry comes before him into his
ears; yea Isa. 65. 24. Genesis 24. 15.
before we call, he answers, and whiles we speak he hears; for by Heb. 10.
19.
the blood of Jesus we may be bold to enter into the holy place, and Ioh. 16.
24.
ask the Father in his name, and we shall receive that our joy may be full; the
spirit also R^m. 8. 27.
makes request for us, according to the will of God; and he that searches the
hearts, knows what is the meaning of the Spirit; and the odor of our prayers,
comes up as the sweet Psalm. 141. 2.
incense before him, being perfumed with those odours that are offered with the
Rev. 8. 3. 4.
prayers of al Saints, out of the Angels hand, that Angel Mal. 3. 1.
of the Covenant, who is now at the right hand of God, Romans 8. 34.
and makes request also for us.

36. Thus the Saints have access unto God, and near communion with him in
prayer; (though the wicked Psalm. 14. 4.
call not upon him, or if they call, he Ioh. 9. 31.
hears them not.) Their golden Rev. 5. 8.
vials are full of odours, they Job. 22. 26. 27.
delight in the Almighty, and lift up their faces unto God, they make their
prayer unto him, and he hears them, and they pay their vows, saying, Psa.
118. 21
I will thank thee for thou have heard me, and have been my salvation, Psalm.
66. 2^*
Blessed be God which has not put back my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

37. The fruits that come vntovs by this holy exercise are more then can be
told; there being infinite occasions from day to day, of making request to the
Lord, and filling our mouths with new so^gs of praise for our salvations.
Admirable is the force and valor of this actio^, which peirceth the heavens
and comes unto God, and prevails with him, in 1 Ioh. 5. 14.
whatsoever we ask according to his will, if we ask in faith, and Iam. 1. 6.
waver not: for he is near to all that call upon him, Psalm. 145. 1^ 19.
to all that call upon him in truth; and fulfilleth the desire of them that fear
him, unto who^ he has promised, Psalm. 81. 10.
Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it. Hereupon Moses said, Deuteronomy. 4. 7.
What nation is so great, unto whom the Gods come so near unto them, as the
Lord our God is near unto us, in all that we call unto him for? And if he be so
near unto every one of us; let us know also, that it will be our good to draw
near unto him, and to say Psalm. 8^. 18.
revive thou us, and we will call upon thy name, because Psalm. 65. 2.
thou hear the prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come; trust in him always
ye people, Psalm. 62. 8.
pour out your hearts before him, for God is our hope; Mic. 7. 7.
our God will hear us.

38. By all these things (and many other the like,) we may see how God has
Psa. 14^. 14*
exalted the horn of his people, which is a praise for all his Saints the sons
of Israel, a people near unto him; unto whom he has given ^ (...). 1. 4.
most great and precious promises, that by the^ they should be partakers of the
godly nature, in that they flee the corruption which is in the world through
lust; with whom he so graciously co^municateth his goodness, yt they taste in
this world, Heb. 6. ^^
of the powers of the world to come, and o^e walk in the light of his face, and
feel his holy presence with them. Which presence, although it be with every of
his Saints, Psalm. 139. 3. 8.
in all places where they become; yet is it most lively seen in their Assembly,
and there Psa. 89. 7.
he is very terrible. For this cause did his people Psalm. 26. 8. and 27. 4.
love the habitation of his house, and desired to dwell there al their days,
that they might be hold his beauty; and being absent from it, their sowles
Psalm. 42. 2.
thirsted for God, saving, when shall we come and appear before the presence of
God? for they knew his promise which had said, In Exodus 20. 24
every place where I shall put the remembrance of my name, I will come unto thee
and bless thee; they knew God was Psalm. 46. 5.
in the mids of his sanctuary, it should not be moved, he would help it very
early. But of this holy society, more is to be spoken particularly in another
place.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Communion that we have with Jesus Christ our Mediator.

Jesus Christ being God 1 Timothy 3. 16.
manifested in the flesh, is given of the Father to be the only 1 Timothy 2. 5.
mediator between him and us; and he has given him power to Ioh. 5. 27.
execute judgment, in that he is the son of Man. He is the Col. 1. 18.
head of the body of the Church; in him Ephesians. 1. 21. 22.
all the buylding coupled together grows unto an holy Temple in the Lord, and
we all are built together in him, to be the habitation of God by the Spirit; he
is Ioh. 14. 6.
the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but by him. And
of him and his mediation, this Oracle was spoken of old to the Saints; that
I^^. 30. (...) 22.
their Noble-ruler should be of themselves, and their Governor ( Mat. 2. 6.
Christ) should proceed from the mids of them; and God would cause him to draw
near and approach unto himself, (when he should ascend Dan. 7. 13. Romans 8. 34.
and sit at his right hand to make intercession for us;) for who is he (else)
that warranteth his heart to come unto me says the Lord: And ye shall be my
people, and I will be your God.

2. As we are made the people and Deuteronomy. 32. 9.
portion of God by Christ, and brought by him Ioh. 17.
unto the fellowship and glory of his Father; so is there a special fellowship
and communion that we have with Christ, being caled thereunto of the Father, as
it is written, 1 Cor. 1. 9.
God is faithful, by whom ye are called unto the communion of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord. And that this has always been the chief end and scope of God
in all his Oracles, since the world began, to draw men unto Christ, and so unto
himself, is Chap. 7. sect 11. 12.
before showed.

3. The sum of the grace given us through communion with our Lord Jesus, is
comprised in those words of the Apostle saying, that Christ is of God made unto
us 1. Cor. 1. 30.
Wisdom, and Justice, and Sanctification, and Redemption. These things he is
unto us by virtue of his Mediatorship, which consists in the three functions
or offices of Prophecy, Priesthood, and Kingdom, committed unto him by the
Father. For from the in most holy place, and from the bosom of the Father, is
he come to Ioh. 1. 18.
declare God unto us; he is a Deuteronomy. 18. 15
Prophet raised up of the Lord, to speak unto us all that he commanded him, and
him are we willed for to hear; the yles Esa. 42. 4.
are to wayt for his Law. And as he being worthy Rev. 5. 1. 5. 9.
obtained to open the book that is in the right hand of him that sits on the
throne, and to loose the seven seals thereof; because Col. 2. 3.
all the treasures of wisdom, and knowledge ar hid in him: so having Ioh. 15.
15.
made known to us al things that he heard of his Father, having declared and
still declaring Ioh. 17. 26.
his Name by his word and spirit, he is the 1. Cor. 1. 24.
Power of God and the wisdom of God unto us. And the things which he has
declared are two; 1 the Law to show us our syn, and the evils due for the same:
2 the Gospel to show us our righteousness by grace from God, with the blessings
that flow therfro^. He also being our Heb. 4. 14.
great high priest or sacrificer has taken away our syns and all the evils
accompanying them, has redeemed us Gal. 3. 13.
from the Curse of the Law, finished Dan. 9. 24.
wickedness, and sealed up sins, made reconciliatio^ for iniquity, and brought
the Romans 5. 17. 1^.
gift of righteousness or Justice: so by his obedience we are made just, and
Verse. 21.
grace shall reign by justice, unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, whose blood does also Heb. 9. 14.
purge our consciences from dead works to serve the Living God, and by the same
has he Heb. 13. 12.
sanctified his people, and contineweth a Priest for ever, and is both our
Justice and Sanctification. Finally this our redemtion from evil, and
restoration unto happiness, he conserveth and maynteyneth by his mighty power,
from al enemies who^ he has subdued under his own feet, and will also subdue
under ours: and is therefore named our John. 12. 15
King, whom Psalm. 72. 11.
al kings shall worship, al nations shall serve, who will Verse. 14.
redeem our sowles from deceit and violence, will giv us also the Romans 8. 23.
redemption of our body, and cause our last enemy Death 1 Cor. 15. 5^.
to be swallowed up in victory, and so will be our full Redemption for ever and
ever, at his appearing with glory, in the day Ephe. 4. ^^
of Redemption.

4. More particularly, touching his Prophecy and our communion with him
therein; as God gave him Isa. 55. 4, John. 18. 37.
for a witness to the people, for a Prince and a Commander unto them; so showed
he himself to be a faithful and true witness, in that he John. 8. 26.
spoke to the world, the things which he had heard of the Father. This he did
in his own person whiles he walked with me^; teaching Mat. 5. and 6. and 7.
chap. etc.
the true meaning and end of al his Fathers Law, and urging the sincere keeping
of it in Love; freeing it also Mark. 7. 6. 8 10. 13.
from the false glosses and leaven of the Pharisees, and cutting down their
traditions; for the Lord to this end, had made Isa. 49. 2. and. 11. 4.
his mouth like a sharp sword; that by the breath of his lips he might slay the
wicked. He also taught the glad tidings of the Gospel unto the poor; thereby
Luke 4. 18. etc.
healing the broken hearted, preaching deliverance to the captives, recovering
of sight to the blind, and the acceptable year of the Lord: that whosoever
should John. 5. 24.
hear his word and beleev in him that sent him; should have everlasting life and
not come into condemnation, but was passed from death unto life. So he Psalm.
40. 10.
hid not his Fathers righteousness within his heart, but declared his truth and
his salvation; he conceled not his mercy and his truth from the great
congregation, but preached peace and comfort to his people. For God had given
him Isa. 50. 4.
a tongue of the Learned, that he might know to minister a word in time to him
that is weary: grace Psalm. 45. 2.
was powered in his lips, and they they were like Some. 5. 13 16
lillies dropping down pure myrrh, and his mouth was sweet things.

5. As in his own person, so did he by others publish the will of his Father,
using hereto the ministry both of men and Angels. He gave and still gives the
Ephesians. 4. 8. ^^
gifts of ministry unto many men; above al other he furnished his Apostles
with Luke 24. 49.
power from on high, and sent them to teach al nations Mat. (...). 20.
to observe al things whatsoever he had commauned them, (and he had Ioh. 15. 15.
made known to them al things that he had heard of his Father:) and they
faithfully performed their charge keeping Act. 20. 27.
nothing back, but showing me^ all the counsel of God, for Christ 2. Cor. 13. 3.
spoke in them: so that now we have 1. Cor. 2. 16.
the mind of Christ, and the word is near us, Romans 10. 8.
even in our mouth and in our heart, neither may we admit of any Gal. 1. 8.
other doctri^e though it should be taught by Angels from heaven, but that which
we have, we must Rev. 2. 25.
hold fast til he come. And Christ it is, that has always reveled Gods will
unto the world since the begi^ning. He it was that preached in Spirit, ^ Pet.
3. 19. 20.
to those that were disobedient in the days of Noe; he Isa. 6. 8. 9. with Ioh.
12. 41.
sent Esaia^ to preach unto Israel, and furnished him with gifts and graces
for that work; and still he sends his messengers daily for Ephesians. 4. 12. 13.
the gathering together of the Saints, the work of the ministry, and
edification of his body, til the worlds end; and they are 2. Cor. 8. 23.
his glory. Finally the heavenly Spirits ar also his messengers for this end
and purpose, when he sees meet so to employ them, as it is written, Rev. 22.
16.
I Jesus have sent my Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.
Thus opening unto us by all means, the secrets of his Gospel, our souls ar
comforted, for he brings us into his Song. ^. 4.
wine celler, and Love is his ^anner over us.

6 To assure the world that he was both the wisdom and power of God, he
confirmed his doctrine ^y signs and wonders, doing such works Ioh. 15. 24.
as no other man did; even as his words were such as John. 7. 46.
never man spoke, his enemies being judges. He gave also of this power, to Mar.
16. 17. 18. 20.
such as believed in his name and were his witnesses; himself working with them,
and confirming the word with signs that followed.

7. Unto this outward administration, Christ annexeth his inward grace by
divine power; making even the Dead Ioh. 5. 25.
to hear his voice and live, for he has the Ioh. 6. 68.
words of eternal life, he opens Act. 16. 14.
the hearts and causes attention, he opens Luk 24. 45.
the minds and causes men to understand the scriptures; he gives them also
Luke 21. 15.
a mouth and wisdom, which al their adversaries are not able to speak against,
nor resist.

8. Now all this life and grace does Christ communicate with the Saints, being
their Head, and they his members. For first the Ministers of the word, how
great gifts or authority soever they have, they al 1 Cor. 3. 22. 2^.
are ours, and we Christ's, and Christ Gods; we are to try their doctrine by
Act. 17. 11.
the scriptures, for they have not 2 Cor. 1. 24.
dominion over our faith, but are helpers of our joy; and in declaration of the
truth 2 Cor. 4. 2.
are to approve themselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
Secondly the Word it self, even all the scriptures, are given Prove. 8. 1. 2. etc
Romans 15. 4.
unto us, and written for our learning and comfort; and this not only to know
for our selves, but to teach exhort and edify 1 These. 5. 11.
one another. Therefore is the word said to be Iam. 1. 2^.
graffed in us, and what by it we do believe, we also may boldly 2 Cor. 4. 13.
speak, and freely Mat. 28. 20.
practice, even all that Christ has commanded; that as he is a Rev. 1. 5.
faithful and true witness, so we also that are the Lords witnesses with him his
chosen servant, (as Isa. 43. 1^.
says the Prophet,) may bear a good testimony unto the truth; and having his
word Col. 3. 16.
dwelling in us plenteously in all wisdom, may thereby our selves Prove. ^. ^^
understand righteousness and judgment, and equity, and every good path, and
be preserved from the evil way; and unto others may impart the Song. 4. 11.
honey and milk of Gods graces that are under our tongue: and having the Psalm.
14^. 6. 7. 8. 9.
high-acts of God in our mouth, and the two-edged sword (of his Heb. 4, 1^.
word) in our hands, may execute vengeance on the hethen, corrections among the
people; binding their kings in chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
this honor is to al his Saints: who Phil. 2. 15. 16.
holding forth the word of life, do shine as lights in the world; Christ
illuminating them with his glory continually, and making his Church by his
Prophecy, the Isa. 22. 5.
vallie of Vision, as of old it was named.

9. Touching his Priesthood, and our communion therewith, two things ar to be
considered; First What of his grace in his own person he has wrought and
works for us; to weet, (...),
the things perteyning to God, (as the Apostle speaks:) which are, Heb. 5, 1.
and 2. 17.
the Offering of a sacrifice, to make reconciliation for our syns; and Heb. 7.
25.
Intercession, which as our 1 John. 2. 1.
Advocate he makes with the Father for us. Secondly, what by his mighty power
he graciously works in us, and applies unto us; whiles he makes us also
Priests unto God his Father, and communicates with us his obedience, death,
burial, resurrection, and ascension; so causing the Blessing of God to come
upon us, (as he is that seed in whom al families of the earth shall be blessed.)
and giving us comfort and peace. Under these two heads, are all things
comprehended, that perteyn to our Justification, and Sanctification, in the
sight of God.

10. These three things of Reconciliation, Intercession and Blessing; the
Priests of Moses law, in shadow and figure of him performed of old for Israel.
The first, whiles at the brazen altar, they Lev. 1. and ^ etc.
offered Burnt- offerings, and For-syn; made Lev. 4. 35.
atonement, and obtained forgivnes at the hands of God, for the sinners: but
chiefly when the high-prest 1 Chr. 23. 13
sanctified the Most holy place, with Lev. 16. 2. 15 -- 34.
blood of the Sacrifice, and made an atonement for the children of Israel, for all their syns once a year. The second; whiles at the Exodus 40. 26 27. and 30.
7. 8. 10.
golden altar, he burned sweet incense every morning and evening; and once a
year also, made reco^ciliatio^ upon the horns thereof, with the blood of y^
Syn-offring; and entered Lev. 16. 12. 13.
with in the veil; putting incense on the fire in the ce^ser before the Lord,
that the clowd of the incense covered the Mercyseat. The third, when having
finished his ministry, the Sacrificer Lev. 9. 22. 23.
lifted up his hand toward the people, and Blessed them; as he was separated
of God 1 Chro. 23. 13.
to bless in his name for ever, and to Number. 6. 23. 27.
put his name upon the children of Israel, that he might bless them, as he had
promised.

11. The truth of these three, are fully performed by the Heb. 3. 1.
Apostle and Highpriest of our profession Christ Jesus. For, that he might
reconcile us unto God, because it was Heb. 10. 4.
impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away syns, neither
would his Father accept other sacrifice or offering, then the Heb. 10. 5. 6. etc.
body which he had ordained his Son: therefore through the eternal Spirit he
offered Heb. 9, 14.
himself without spot unto God, and gave his Mat. 20. 28.
soul for the ransom of many, bare 1 Pet. 2. 24.
our syns in his body on the tree, and by his Heb. 9. 12.
own blood entered in once unto the holy place, (not the holy places made with
hands, but ver. 24.
into very heaven,) and obtained eternal redemption. So the Lord took away
Zach. 3. 9.
the iniquity of his land in one day, (as he had promised;) for the ransom was
most precious, even of infinite value and effect, seeing by the union of the
God head with the manhood in this our Highpriests person, it was the blood of
Act. 30. 38.
God himself, (as the scripture speaks,) wherewith we are purchased. Thus
Christ has Romans 5. 10.
reconciled us that were enemies, unto God by his death; and has put away syn,
John. 1. 29.
by the sacrifice of Heb. 9. 26.
himself: for he was the Lamb of God, that takes away the syn of the world;
and the prophecy of Abraham was fulfilled, Genesis 22. 8.
God will provide him a Lamb for a burnt offering, my son.

12. Touching Christ's Intercession, as he prayed John. 17.
for his church when he was on earth, and his Father heard him Ioh. 11. 42.
always; so now being ascended and set at the right hand of God, he still Romans
8. 34.
makes request for us, being therefore entered into very heaven, to appear now
Heb. 9. 24.
in the sight of God for us. Whose prayer as it is pure and perfect, so
prevails it with God, and is of unspeakable efficacy, to make us to be
accepted. For the Father loves the Son, and accepts him better then he did
his servant Job, when Job. 42. 8. 9.
he prayed for the trespassers. This is that Angel, (the Mal. 3. 1.
Angel or messenger of the covenant,) that has a Rev. 8. ^* ^0
golden censer, and much odours, which he offreth with the prayers of all
Saints, upon the golden altar that is before the throne; the smoke of which
odours, with the prayers of the Saints, goes up before God out of the Angels
hand: and unto his requests, which he makes for his afflicted people, the
Lord Zach. 1. 12. 13.
answers good and comfortable words. Thus our high sacrificer, having the
Exodus 28. 9 -- 12.
names of the whole Israel of God, as it were graven upon two precious stones,
and embossed in gold; bears us upon his two shoulders, for a remembrance; and
presents us pure and holy and just, before the Lord.

13. The things toward us, which are his Blessing and the fruits that follow, he
graciously communicates as a merciful and faithful high priest, Heb, 4. 15.
touched with the feeling of our infirmites; being raised up unto us of God,
and sent Act. 3. 26.
to Bless us, in turning every one of us from our iniquities. And as at the
end of his ministry upon earth, he Luke 24. 50. 51.
lifted up his hands and blessed his disciples, and then was taken from them
into heaven: so, continewing still a Heb. 6. 20. and 7. 1. 7.
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek, (who met Abraham and blessed
him,) he still blesses the children of Abraham; giving and applying the
promises of the Gospel, unto the hearts and consciences of his people; even the
Number. 6. 24. 25. 26.
favor and protection of God, the light of his countenance, and his peace. So
the Gal. 3. 14
blessing of Abraham comes on us through Christ Jesus, who is that promised
seed, in ver. 8.
whom al nations ar blessed; and whom God has set to be Psalm, 21. 6.
Blessings for ever. Thus Christ, by Sacrifice has merited, by Intercession
obteyneth, and by Blessing bestows and distributeth unto us, the love and
graces of God his Father, even all things perteyning to life and godliness: that
we being partakers of his peace, may again bless God, even the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 1. 3.
which has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in
Christ, as the Apostle says.

14. The communion of this Blessing, is more particularly to be discerned in
that honor of Priesthood, which is given to al Christians; and the seals of
Gods grace, and love toward us in Christ. For he has made us Rev. 1. 6.
Priests unto God even his Father, and we as lively stones 1 Pet. 2. 5.
are made a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. For first, applying him unto our
selves by Faith, his sufferings death and burial are Isa. 53. 4. 5.
ours; his righteousness, resurrection, and glorious victory over syn, Satan,
Death and Hell, Romans 4. 25. and 8. 33. 34.
ours; so that we Heb. 10. 19. 20.
by the blood of Jesus, may be bold to enter into the holy place, (though the
Levitical Priests might Lev. 16. 2.
not enter into the shadow thereof at al times;) by the new and living way
which he has prepared for us, through the veyl that is his flesh: even Heb.
4. 16,
boldly may we go unto the throne of grace, that we may receiv mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need. Presenting unto God his Father and ours,
this Lamb that was slain for our syns, who is our Heb. 7. 22.
surety and our 1 Cor. 5. 7.
sacrifice, by whose 1 Pet. 1. 24.
stripes we are healed, by whose death Gal. 2. 20.
we are restored to life, by whose Heb. 10. 10.
body once offered we are sanctified; upon whose Lev. 4. 15.
head we have laid the burden of our syns, and by whose Gal. 3. 13. 14.
curse, we are made the heirs of blessing, and of all the riches of Gods grace.

15. We also Romans 1^. ^,
giv up our own bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
our reasonable serving of God; so the heavenly Jerusalem is filled with Eze.
36. 3^
the Flocks of men, as the earthly once was with Flocks of holinesses or
sacrifices external. Our spirits being contrite, our hearts humbled and broken
for our syns; ar the Psalm 51, 17.
sacrifices of God also, which he will not despise. By Christ, we Heb. 13. 15.
offer the sacrifice of Praise always to God that is the fruit (or Hos, 14. 3.
calves) of our lips, which confess his name, and magnify him with
thanksgiving: Psalm, 69. 31.
this also pleases the Lord, better then ox or heiffer, that bears horns,
that parts the hoof. Our Act. 24. 17.
alms and offerings for relief of the poor, especially the ministers of the
Gospel of Christ: are Phil. 4. 18. Heb. 13. 16.
an odor that smells sweet, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God.
Finally if we be Phil. 2. 17, 2 Timothy 4. 6.
powered out as a drink offering, upon the sacrifice and service of the faith of
Christ's church, and do Heb. 12. 4.
resist unto blood striving against syn: we have (...) 16. 15
cause to rejoice; for precious in ye sight of the Lord, is the death of ^. 10
his Saints; and the souls of such, rest under the altar, til the Lord holy
and true, do avenge their blood on the^ that dwell on the earth.

16. This honor of Priesthood, (which Heb. 5. 4.
no man can take to himself, nor Job. 3, 27,
any other thing except it be given him from heaven,) Rev, 5. 10.
Christ gives unto us, of his rich grace by his word and spirit. For as by the
preaching of ye Gospel, he is daily described in our sight, and among us Gal 3.
1.
crucified: so we by the ministry of the Gospel, are made Romans 15. 16. Isa.
66. 20.
an acceptable offering unto the Lord, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. His
word is a Heb. 4. 12.
sharp two edged sword, and divides a sunder the sowl and the spirit, the
joints and the marow; by it we are taught to Col. 3. 5.
mortify our members which are on earth; his spirit is as Mat. 3. 11.
fire, where with we being baptized, do also Romans 8. 13.
mortify the deeds of the body, that we may live, and give our selves up unto
God for a Romans 12. 1,
living sacrifice. The afflictions that we feel in this world, when for his
sake we Romans 8. 36.
are killed all the day long, and are counted as sheep for the slaughter, do 2
Cor. 4. 10. 11.
bear about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus, and are always delivered
unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of our Lord Jesus might be made
manifest in our mortal flesh: these serve for furtherances of our
sanctification, by being Heb. 12. 10.
partakers of his holiness; and make us as Genesis 15. 9. 11. 13.
sacrifices, and a prey for the ravenous fowls, whiles we live strangers here
on earth, the land that is not ours, as did Ahrahams seed. Thus ar we named
Isa, 61. 6.
the Priests of the Lord, and have authority in Mal. 1. 11.
every place to offer incense unto his name, and a pure offering, both we and
our works, (our spiritual sacrifices,) being acceptable unto God in Christ
Jesus.

17. To illustrate and seal up more assuredly our communion with Christ's
Priesthood, We are washed with water, for a sign and assurance, of the Act. 3.
38. and 22. 16.
forgivnes and washing away of our syns, and to be as the Tit. 3. 5.
laver of our regeneration and new birth; whereby we are also baptized Romans 6. 3.
4.
into his death, and buried with him by baptism; that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in
newnes of life, our Job. 6.
old man being crucified with him, that the body of syn might be destroyed, and
our selves be verse. 18.
dead to syn, but alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord; whom by this symbol we
have Gal. 3. 37.
put on, and do bear his name upon us, with Mat. 28. 1^.
the name of the Father and of the holy Spirit. And after this, Christ often
feeds our sowles, with his own Mat. (...). (...) and^.
body and blood, which was broken and powered out for our sakes, figured out
unto us by bread and wine: hereby co^firming the former grace of remission of
syns, and a further growth in Christ continually, into whom we are incorporate,
and have so near a 1. Cor. (...). ^^
communion with him, under these visible earthly elements; which we looking
past by the eye of faith, seeing and feeding upon Christ, have Job. 6. 57.
our life by him, do verse. 56.
dwell in him and he in us, and shall by him be verse. 54.
raised up at the last day, unto life eternal.

18. Having seen how Christ being our Prophet informs us in all the wisdom of
God, and by the Law shows us our syn and wretchedness; by the Gospel, our
justice and happiness; and being our Priest and Sacrifice, has by himself
purged us from al syn, and given us the gift of justice and sanctity to
present us pure and blameless before God his Father: it remains, that we
also consider, how he conserveth and mainteyneth this our blessed state;
against al enemies, by his mighty power and sovereignty, which as Lord and King
he has over al.

19. This soveraigntie, is set forth by diverse titles of honor and dignity
given him in the scriptures; as when he is named Messiah the (...) Dan. 9. 25.
Governor, Captain or Fore- leader; the (...) Mic. 5. 2.
Ruler, that is, having dominion right and authority, to govern (...) Mat. 2.
6.
and guide his people; Michael Dan 12. 1.
the great Prince; the Ios 5. 14.
Captain of the Lords host; a master (...) Isa. 55. 4.
or Commander to the peoples; a Potentate or Psalm. 45. 3.
Mighty one; the Rev. 19. 16.
king of kings and Lord of Lords, and (...) Rev. 1. 5.
Prince of the kings of the earth, the Act. 10. 36.
Lord of all, unto whom is given Mat. 28. 18.
al power in heaven and in earth, an Dan. 7. 14.
everlasting dominion, and honor and kingdom, that al peoples nations and
languages shall serve him. And he the true Heb. 7. 1. 2.
Melchisedek king of Salem, shall reign as Isa. 32. 1.
king in justice, and sit as Isa. 9. 6. ^.
Prince of Peace, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to order it
and to stablish it, with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for
ever.

20. This kingdom of Christ, is no earthly Monarchy, nor Ioh. 18. 36.
of this world; but spiritual and Mat. 3. 2.
heavenly: and therefore is more mighty then the kingdoms of the earth, able
Dan. 2. 34. 35. 44* 45. Luke 20. 18.
to beat down, break in pieces, and grind to powder al adverse power and
domination; whither of this world, or Ephe. 6. 12.
the spiritual wickednesses which are in the high places.

21. Therefore also is the manner of administering this kingdom, no^ worldly nor
pompous; but a^ Christ the king himself, came unto us Zach. 9. 9.
poor, and riding upon an asse^ and he the Rev. 5, 5.
Lion of the tribe o^ Judah, the root of David, was for to see to, like ver. 6,
a killed Lamb: s^ menageth he his kingdom stil^ Zach. 4. 6.
neither by an army, nor a Power but by his Spirit; that it comes not Luke 17.
20. 21.
with observation, for men to say, Lo here or lo there, but is with in us;
wielded by the spiritual scepter of his word (the Gospel Mat. 4, 23.
of the kingdom,) and by the almighty working of the Spirit, and therefore
conteyneth in it Luke 8. 10,
mysteries or secrets, that can not be understood but by the gift of God.

22. Our Lord himself, has subdued, and daily subdueth al his foes; the world
John, 16. 33
he has overcome; syn he has Romans 8, 3,
condemned and Heb 9. 26.
putaway, Death he has 2 Timothy 1, 10.
abolished; and the Divil that had the power there of, he has Heb. 2. 14.
destroyed: neither shall these, or any of these, ever have dominion over him;
but he shall reign, til he has put 1 Cor. 15. 2^
all his enemies under his feet, and death and hell Rev. ^0. 14*
be cast into the lake of fire.

23. This his power and regiment, he co^municateth with his Saints, two manner
of ways; First by applying unto them for their benefit and salvation, all that
himself has done and does; as the Lord says by his prophet Zach. 9. 8.
I will camp about mine house, against the army, against him that passes by,
and against him that returns, and no oppressor shall come upon them any more.
And as for their sakes, Christ John. 17. 19.
sanctified himself, so for their John. 16. 33.
comfort he overcame the world; to take away 1 Ioh, 3. 5.
their syns, did he appear, when in himself there was no syn; for the Dam. 12. 1.
children of the people Israel stands this Michael the great prince, and Rev.
12, 7. 9 10.
fights against the Dragon and casts him out of heaven; where now is
salvatin, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; the accuser
of the Saints being cast down. Wherefore the Lord being king, Psalm. 97, 1.
the earth may rejoice, and the multitude of the yles be glad; because he ver.
10,
preserves the souls of his Saints, he will deliver them from the hand of
the wicked; he will Psalm 78. 2. 3
judge the people of God in justice, and his poor with equity, that the
mountains and the hills shall bring peace to the people by justice, and in his
ver. 7.
days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace shall be so long as
the moon endures. For the Zach, 9. 10.
charets being cut off from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, the bow of
the battle shall be broken, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; but in y^
Psalm. 108. 8.
mornings he will destroy all the wicked of the land, Isa. 11. 4.
smiting the earth with the rod of his mouth, and slaying the wicked with the
breath of his lips; wou^ding Psa. 110. ^. Isa. 63. 6.
kings and treading down peoples in the day of his wrath. Therefore the poor
shall Psalm. 10. 14.
committ themselves unto him, and triumph in his salvation saying; ver. 16.
The Lord is king for ever and ever, the hethen are destroyed forth of his
land; Rev. 11. 15,
the kingdoms of this world are our Lords, and his Christ's, and he shall reign
for evermore.

24. Secondly he co^municateth with his Saints this grace, to be Rev, 5, 10.
and 20. 4.
Kings also with him, and to reign on earth: that as himself Zach. 6. 13.
sits and rules upon his throne, and is a Priest upon his throne, and the
counsel of peace is between them both: so they whom he has made Rev. 1. 6.
kings and Priests unto God his Father, being a 1 Pet. ^. 9.
kingly priesthood, even a Exodus 19. 6.
kingdom of Priests and an holy nation; having part Rev. 20. 6.
in the first resurrection, the second death may have no power over them; but
being the Priests of God and of Christ, and reigning with him the term of
years limited; at last, when they have overcome, may Rev. ^. 21.
sit with Christ in his throne; even as he overcame, and sits with his Father
in his throne.

25. This spiritual kingdom, whereby the Saints reign on earth, is first over
their own syns and corruptions; for they are careful to be upright with God,
and to Psalm. 18. 23,
keep themselves from their wickedness; and the Lord Mi^. 7. 19.
subdueth their iniquities, that syn shall Romans 6. 14.
not have dominion over them, because they are ver. 22.
freed from it, and made servants unto God, having their fruit in holiness, and
the end everlasting life. And this victory whereby they overcome themselves,
is greater the^ al earthly conquests, according to the true proverb; Pro. 16.
32.
He that is slow to anger, is better then the Mighty man; and he that rules
his own spirit, (is better) then he that wins a city. Secondly it is over
the world, which also they set themselves against, as knowing that it 1 Ioh. 5.
19.
lies in wickedness; the wisdom thereof is 1 Cor. 1. 20. and 2. 6.
foolishnes, and comes to naught; the pleasures of it are Eccl. 1. and 2. etc.
vanity, and vexatio^ of spirit; the sorrows of it work 3 Cor. 7. 10.
death; and the amity thereof is Iam. 4. 4.
the enmity of God: therefore flee they the 2 Pet. 1. 4.
corruption that is in the world through lust, walking before God as 1 Chronicles.
29. 15.
strangers and pilgroms on earth, not loving 1 Ioh. 2. 15.
the world, nor the things that are in the world, which have neither Eccl. 5.
9.
satisfying nor fruit in the^ but being Gal. 6. 14.
crucified unto it, and it unto them, they keep themselves Iam. 1. 27.
unspotted of it, and free from ye Gal. 5. 1.
bondage and servitude of the same; they use it, as though they used it ^ Cor.
7. 23. 31
not; they bear with patience all the reproaches and injuries that it offreth;
yea though they be made the 1 Cor. 4, 9. 13.
gazing stock and as the filth of the same, yet are they Romans 8. 37.
more then conquerours through him that loved the^, and do fulfill that which is
written, 1 Ioh. 5. 4,
All that is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that
overcomes the world, eve^ our faith. Thirdly the conquest of the Saints is
over Satan himself, the prince of this world, and worker of all mischief. Him
also they 1 Pet. 5. ^.
resist steadfast in the faith, and do Rev. 12. 11.
overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony,
and love not their lives unto the death: so that wicked one Iam. 4. 7.
flees from them, and 1 Ioh. 5. 18.
touches them not, for they keep themselves, because they are begotten of God,
who will Romans 16. 20.
tread that adversary under their feet shortly, and with him shall be destroyed
1 Cor. 15. 26
the last enemy, Death. And as now, the Saints do reign with Christ on
earth, by faith and patience: so then, having 1 Cor. 6. 2. 3*
judged the world, and even the Angels; they shall reign Romans 8. 17. 2 ^^m. 2.
12. 1 These. 4. 17.
with him in glory, in heaven for evermore.

26. To teach us this Communion with Christ, we have in the scripture many
doctrines and similitudes; as that he will make his church a Isa. 41. 1^.
roller and a new threshing instrument having teeth, for to thresh the
mountayns, and bring them to powder; and make the hills as chaff: that he Psalm.
68. 35.
gives strength and power to his people, making Mic. 4. 13.
their horn iron, and their hoofs brass, and themselves Zach. 10. 3.
as his bewtiful horse in the battle; that they shall be as ver. 5.
the mighty men, which tread down (their enemies) in the mire of the streets in
the battle; for Zach. 9. 15.
the Lord of hosts shall defend them, and they shall devowr and subdue their
foes. That Christ shall Psalm. 4^. 16.
make his children Princes throughout all the earth; and as himself has Rev.
19. 12.
many Crowns upon his head, so will he communicate them with his Saints; as
the crowns of his figure Zach. 6. 11. 14.
Jesus son of Iehozadak the high Priest, were to Helem, Tobijah and others for
a memorial in the temple of the Lord. That as Christ is the head corner stone,
Luke 20. 17. 18.
upon which whosoever fall, shall be broken, and on whomsoever it fall, it shall
grind them to powder: so Jerusalem (his church) shall be made Zach. 12. 3.
a heavy stone for all people* all that lift it up shall be torn, though all the
people of the earth be gathered together against it. That as Christ shall Psalm.
2. 9.
crush the nations with a scepter of iron, and break them in pieces like a
potters vessel: so Rev. 2. 26. 27.
he that overcomes and keeps his works unto the end; to him will he give
power over nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, that as potters
vessels they shall be broken; even as he received of his Father, ver. 28.
so will he give to that man, the morning star.

27. To illustrate this Communion between our Savior and us, we have the
similitude of an humane body, the members whereof by their due joints and
synewes ar joined to the head, receiv from it life and motion, and government
in all the actions and affayrs: so Christ Col. 1, 18. 1 Cor. 12, 1^. etc.
is the head of the body of his church, and communicates with all the Saints
his members, Gal. 2, 20. Romans 8. 32.
life and grace, and al good things for their conservation. Also of a vine or
Olive tree whose branches ar made partakers of the juice sap and fatnes Romans
11. 17.
that is in the root and stock: so we abiding in Ioh. 15. 1. 2, 4. 5.
Christ the true vine, do by the juice and moisture of his grace live and bear
fruits to the praise of God. Again as the husband and wife, are not two, Mar.
10. 8.
but one flesh; and the first woman Genesis 2. 22.
builded of the rib of man, was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, and so
did love and live together partaking each with others well fare: in like manner
are we joined to the Lord, and made 1 Cor. 6. 17.
one spirit; he that Isa. 54, 5. Hos. 2. 20.
made us is our husband, and we are married to him in faith; whereupon he Ephesians.
5. 29. 30.
nourishes and cherishes us; for we are members of his body, of his flesh and
of his bones; and this is a ver, 32.
great Secret, as the Apostle says, which they that would behold, had need
Rev, 21. 9. 20.
be carried in Spirit (as was John) to a great and an high Mountain, there to be
showed this Spowse adorned with the glory of God, and al precious ornaments of
his Spirit. And so greatly does the King Psalm. 45. (...).
delight in her bewty, that the words which were spoken to the first woman
Evah, how Genesis 3. ^6.
her desire should be unto her husband; are now on the other hand, (as touching
the affection of love) applied by the Spowse unto him whom her sowl loves,
Song, 7. 10.
I am my welbeloveds, and his desire is toward me.

28. From all that which is before spoken, of the Communion that God has caled
us unto with his Son, it follows, that whatsoever justice and holiness was in
Christ manifested in the flesh, either by nature or by actio^; the same is made
Romans 4. 24. 25, and 5. 19.
ours by grace and imputation: as on the contrary, whatsoever syn and
unrighteousness is in us by nature or action, the same is made 2 Cor. 5. 21.
his by imputation, and by him is healed Psalm. 40. 12.
and taken away; that it can not be we now Romans 8. 1. 38 ^9.
should perish, if we hold fast our faith and confidence of rejoicing unto the
end. Whatsoever troubles, sorrows or tentations, (syn only excepted,) do
befall us in this life; the like have befalle^ Heb. 4. 15.
unto him, were by him overcome, and shall from Rev. 21. 4.
us, as already they are from him, be done away. Finally whatsoever John. 8.
36. Romans 8. 2. Gal 3. 13. and 5. 1. Lev. 26. 13. 1 Cor. 7. 23. Mat. 17. 25. 27.
1 Cor. 6. 12. and 10. 25. 26.
freedom and liberty, Christ as man, in ordinary estate, had on earth
co^versing among men^ the like has he given, daily gives and confirms unto
Christians; whither we respect the spiritual law of God, or the politic laws
of men, and civil states. For he it is that Gal. 2. 20.
lives in us; himself Song. 6. 2.
is ours, and we are his, Romans 6. 5. 6. 8.
graffed into his death and resurrection to eternal life: he has given Isa.
46. 13.
his glory unto Israel; even the Ioh. 17. (...)* 23.
glory that the Father gav him, has he given us, that we may be one; as the
Father and he ar one, he in us, and God in him; and where he is, verse. 24.
there shall we also be to behold his glory; though for the present we walk 2.
Co^. 5. 7.
by faith and not by sight, and it does 1. John. ^. 2.
not yet appear what we shall be. The consideration of which riches of his grace,
may cause us to say with the prophet, Zach. 9. 17.
how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty? And we may conclude
with the last word of Moses the man of God, Deuteronomy. 33. 29
Blessed art thou o Israel: who is like unto thee, o people saved by the Lord,
the shield of thine help, and which is the sword of thy glory? therefore thine
enemies shall be in subjectio^ to thee, and thou shall tread upon their high
places.

CHAP. XIII.
Of our Communion with the holy Ghost.

ALthough the fellowship that we have with the holy Ghost, (who is 1 Ioh. 5. 7.
one with the Father and the Son,) may much be discerned by that which is
before spoken of God and of Christ: yet because the scripture speaks many
things of the work of Gods Spirit in us, and particularly of the ^ Cor. 13. 13
Communion of the Holy Ghost with us; it will be for the good and comfort of the
Saints, to consider the graces and benefits that do come unto them, by this
communion also in particular.

2. And this the rather, for that the Spirit is the Comforter, (that Ioh. 14.
16. (...).
other Comforter or Advocate,) which the Father at Christ's request does give
unto us for to abide with us for ever, and cheer us in the absence of our Lord
Jesus from us, (who is gone unto his Father and ours) that we should not be
left as Ioh. 14. 18.
orphans on earth, destitute of help and comfort amids our many trials and
tribulations.

3. Very great is the grace, and admirable the strength and consolation, which
this Comforter gives to the Saints; as the example of the Apostles themselves
does confirm; who all the while that Christ was with them in this world, though
he ceased not to teach and inform the^, to comfort and embolden them, to
reprove and blame them, as there was occasion: yet were they Mat. 16. 8. 23.
and 17. 20 and 20. 22. 24 25. and 26. 31 40. 56. Mark. 16. 14.
weak and faint in faith, fearful of their enemies, forgetful of Christ's
promises, without understanding of his mysteries, and overcaried many ways
with their own infirmities. But when he had sent down upon them Luke 24. 4^.
the promise of his Father, and endued them with power from on high, Act. 1. 5.
baptising them with the holy Ghost: then began they to speak with Act. 2. 4.
11.
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance, the wonderful works of God;
showed great Act. 4. 8. 13. 1. 9. 31. 33.
boldness in preaching the word, and with great power witnessed the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus, and Act. 5. 12. 15 41. 42. and throughout the whole book.
many signs and wonders were showed by their hands, and they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ amongst many troubles; rejoicing that they were
counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his name.

4. Neither unto them alone was the holy Ghost given, (though the abundance of
his graces was powered most plentifully upon them;) but all that in those days,
or before, or since, do believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, ar sealed also with
the same spirit of promise* and furnished in some mesure with the gifts of the
same. Which grace the Lord himself proclaimed in that Ioh: 2. 7* ^^
last and great day of the Feast of Tabernacles, saying, verse. 30.
He that believes in me, as says the scripture, out of his bel'y shall flow
rivers of water of life; speaking this verse. 39.
of the Spirit, which they that believed in him, should receiv; for if Romans 8.
9.
any man have not the Spirit of Christ, the same is not his.

5. As there is but Ep^ 4. 6. 5.
one God and Father of al, and one Lord Jesus Christ; so is there but one and 1.
Cor. 12. 4. 5, 6.
the same Spirit: although for the verse. 8. -- 11.
diversities of gifts which that Spirit distributeth among the Saints, the
scripture sometime speaks as of Rev. 1. 4.
seven Spirits which are before the throne of God; (seven being a full and
perfect number, and signifying 1. Sam. ^. 5. Ier. 15 9. Prove. 26 25. 16.
Many:) and these seven Spirits be the Rev. 5. 6.
seven horns and seven eyes, (that is the manifold and absolute power and
providence) of the Lamb Christ Jesus; of whom it was prophesied, that Isa. 11.
2.
the Spirit of the Lord should rest upon him; the Spirit of wisdom, and
Understanding; the Spirit of counsel, and of strength; the Spirit of knowledge,
and of the fear of the Lord: of who^ also it was witnessed, Io^. ^. 34.
God gives him not the Spirit by mesure.

6. The Spirit, as he was at first Genesis 1. 2. Psalm. 33. 6.
creator of the world, with the Father and ye Son; and Job. 26. 13.
garnished the heave^s: so is he still the Luk 11. 20 with Mat. 12 28.
finger of God, that works effectually al his actions, Psalm. 104. 30
creating the creatures, and renewing the face of the earth. And generally as
God speaks unto men outwardly, by the ministry of his word: so sends he
also inwardly, motions of his Spirit; against which many struggle, to their
just judgment. In the old world Genesis 6. 3.
Gods spirit strove in man, as his word was 2. Pet. 2. 5.
preached by Noah; but they Job. ^2. 15. 17.
said unto God, Depart from us: wherefore they were Job. 32. 16.
wrinckled before the time, and the flood was powered out upon their foundation.
When Israel came out of Egypt, the Lord sent before them Mic. 6. 4.
Moses Aaron and Miriam, to guyd them outwardly by kingdom priesthood and
prophecy; he gave them also Neh. 9. 20.
his good Spirit to instruct them, and Jesus Christ his Son, the Isa. 63. 9.
Exodus 23. 20. 21.
Angel of his face or presence, saved them: yet they both Psa. 106. 16.
envied Moses, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord; and often Psa. 78. 40. 41.
provoked, grieved, and tempted God himself, and limited the Holy one of
Israel; they rebelled and Isa. 63. 10.
vexed his holy Spirit, (ye Spirit of ye Lord ver. 14.
which had given the^ rest*) therefore was he turned to be their enemy, and
fought against them. In these last days of the Gospel, we are also taught,
how some that have tasted of the heavenly gift, and Heb. 6. 4. 5. 6.
were made partakers of the Holy Ghost; yet fall so away that they cannot be
renewed unto repentance. So that even* wicked men and reprobates, do often
receive Number, 24. 2. Mat. 7. 22. ^3.
the gifts of the Spirit, whereby they do many great works, yet are not
benifited hereby unto salvation* for they have not the grace of God to
sanctify those gifts, and seal the^ up unto the day of redemption; therefore
God 1 Samuel 16. ^4. Psalm. 51. 11.
takes his holy Spirit from them, and sometime sends his evil spirit in sted
thereof, to vex them, as he did unto 1 Samuel 18. 10
Saul; and this worthily, seeing there are of these wretches, that do even Heb.
10. 29.
despite the Spirit of grace.

7. But the Saints elect of God, have an other manner communion with the Holy
Ghost; for their help comfort and sanctification in this life, and assurance of
life eternal. For, because they are sons, Gal. 4. 6.
God sends the Spirit of his son into their hearts, which cries Abba Father;
so they are Gal. 4. 7*
no more servants but sons, and heyrs also of God through Christ, who has
obtained of his Father Ioh. 14. 16. 17.
this Comforter to abide with them* for ever, even the Spirit of truth whom the
world cannot receiv* because it sees him not, neither knows him; but they
know him, for he dwells with them, and shall be in them; their Cor. 6. 19.
bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost.

8. The communion which the Saints have with the Spirit, is in many
particulars; and that from the beginning of their days, unto the end. For
Jeremiah Ier. 1. 5.
was sanctified, and John Baptist Luke 1. 15.
filled with the Holy Ghost, even from their mothers wombs. And we all that are
born of God, have our regeneration and new birth Job. 3 5.
of the Spirit: and according to his mercy are saved, Tit. 3. 5.
by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.

9. The word of God, which it the immortal seed whereby we are begotten, has
always been uttered, explayned, and understood, by means of this Spirit. David
testifies of himself, that ^ Sam. 23. 2
the Spirit of the Lord spoke in him, and his word was in his tongue: our Mas.
22. 43. Act. 1. 16.
savior Christ, and his Apostles do witness also the same concerning him; so
the things that he spoke, we must receiv, as the sayings Heb. 3. 7. with Psalm.
95 7.
of the Holy Ghost. The like is to be minded for Act. 28. 25.
Isaias Mic. 3. 8.
Michaias, and al other Prophets, by whose hands the Lord Neh. 9. 30. Zach. 7.
12.
protested among his people by his spirit; for Prophecy (as the Apostle 2 Pet.
1. 21.
says) came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God, spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost; the Lord Jehovah and Isa. 48. 16.
his Spirit sent them. Yea Christ himself had the Mat. 1^. 18.
Spirit of God put on him, that he might show judgment to the Gentiles; and was
anointed with Luke ^. 18. Act. 1^. 38.
the Spirit, that he might preach the Gospel to the poor; and unto the Apostles
whom he had chosen, gave he commandments through Act. 1. ^*
the Holy Ghost, who also having received 1 Cor. 2. ^^
the Spirit which is of God, spoke the things that were given them of him, not
in the words which man's wisdom taught, but which ver. 13.
the holy Ghost did teach them: so preached they ye Gospel unto the Saints, 1
Pet. ^. 1^.
by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.

10. Unto this Gospel of salvation first preached by the Lord, and after
confirmed by them that heard him; God Heb. ^. ^. ^.
bare witness both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts
of the Holy Ghost. For to one (as the Apostle says) Cor. 12. ^. 9, 10. etc.
was given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to an other the word of knowledge,
by the same spirit; to an other Faith, by the same Spirit; to an other, the
gifts of healing, by the same Spirit; to an other the operations of great
works; to an other Prophecy; to an other discerning of spirits; to an other
diversities of tongues; to an other, the interpretatio^s of tongues* and al
these things wrought even the self same Spirit, distributing to every man
severally as he would.

11. But these spiritual gifts, though they were powered out upon many; yet are
they not, neither ever were given unto al; as it is written, 1 Cor. 12. 30
Are al doers of miracles? have all the gifts of healing? do al speak with
tongues? do al interpret? Again, to all that have them, they are not seals of
the adoption of Sons; for if men have 1 Cor. 13. ^.
prophecy, and know al secrets and al knowledge; if they have al faith, so
that they can remove mountayns, and have not Love, they are nothing. Yet is this
1 Cor. 1^. ^.
manifestation of the Spirit given to every man to profit withal: and as the
Apostles were Gods witnesses concerning the things which they said; so Act. ^.
3^.
was the holy Ghost, whom God gave to them that obeyed him; the Spirit was one
1 John. ^. ^.
of the three witnesses on earth, as the Apostle John says.

12. As the mystery of Christ was reveled Ephesians. 3. 5.
to his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit, and they preached the Gospel
unto others, 1 Pet. 1. 1^.
by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; and as the ordinary permanent
officers of the Churches, are made Overseers Act. 20. 28.
by the Holy Ghost, to feed the Church of God: so by the hearing of Faith
preached, do men Gal. 3. 2.
receive the Spirit; which God openly showed, when while Peter yet was
speaking, Act. 1^. 44.
the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard th^^ word. And as by the work of
the Spirit, the word is received and believed; so is the same also 1 Pet. 1.
(...).
obeyed, kept and retained, ^ Tim. 1. 14.
through the Holy Ghost that dwells in us. The Sacraments also have by him
their effects in us, as it is written, 1 Cor. 12. 13
by one Spirit are we al baptized into one body, whither Jews or Greeks,
whither bond or free, and have been a^^ made to drink into one Spirit.

13. And having thus our new birth, caling unto, and stablishing in the faith,
by the work of the holy Ghost; we are further by him confirmed, comforted,
emboldned, and assisted, in all our spiritual battles against Satan, this world,
and our own corruptions. For wear Ephesians. 3. 16.
stre^gthned by Gods Spirit in the inner man; and being armed with the word of
God which is the Ephesians. 6. 17.
sword of the Spirit, we stand fast; and though the enemy come like a flood,
yet Isa. 59. 19.
the Spirit of the Lord shall chase him away, as says the Prophet. And in
rebuking the world, he uses great boldness, convincing John. 16. 8. 11.
them of syn, of righteousness, and of judgment: so that Gods servants ar full
of power Mic. 3. 8.
by the Spirit of the Lord and of judgment, and of strength, to declare unto
the people their tra^gression, and their syn; an example whereof we may see in
Paul. Act. 13. 9. 10. 11.
Saul, who being full of the Holy Ghost, set his eyes upon Elymas the sorcerer
and said; O full of al subtilty, and al mischief, child of the Divil, enemy of
all righteousness; will thou not ce^se to pervert the straight ways of the
Lord? Now therefore behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shall be
blind, and not see the Sun for a season. And this courage the Saints have
even before Princes and potentates of (...) earth (...) ^ay be (...) in 2.
Chro^. 24 20. 21.
Zech^^^ah son of Iehojada, who being clo^^ed with the Spirit, and rebuking the
transgressions of the people, was therefore stoned with stones, at the
commandment of the king. For the Luke 12. 11. ^.
H^ly Ghost teaches them in that ^owr what they ought to say; wherefore they
are to take no thought how or what to answer, but resting upon the aid of Gods
Spirit, do boldly say, Psalm. 119. 46
^ will speak of thy testimonies (Lord) before kings, and will not be ashamed.

14 But in the Saints themselves, the Spirit is most mighty in operation for
the subduing and sanctifying of their affections, and confirmation of their
sowles and spirits in the love and favor of God. For whereas before time, some
of them were fornicators, idolaters, theves, covetous, extortioners, or given
to other like vices: 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. 11.
they (...) washed, they a (...), they are ^ustified in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the Spirit of God. And whereas while they were fleshly, Jude. ver.
19
having not the Spirit they walked after the Romans 8. 4. 5. 8. 13.
flesh, and favou^ed the things t^^^ of, and could not ^lease God, but were
subject unto death: now he that raised up Christ from the Dead, does also
quicken their mortal bodies, v^r. 11.
because that his Spirit dwells in them; and so is fulfilled that which in
figure God said of old unto Israel; Eze. 37. 13. 14.
Ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, o my people,
and brought you up out of your sepulchers, and shall put my Spirit in you, and
ye shall live. Who then living in the Spirit, do also Gal. 5. 25.
walk in the Spirit, and by it do Romans 8. 13.
mortify the deeds of the body, not Gal. 5. 16. 24.
fulfilling the lusts of the flesh, which they have crucified, but bringing
forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are Gal. 5. 2^.
love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meeknes,
te^perance* for when the Spirit is powered upon them from above; then Isa. 32.
15.
the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, a^ says the Prophet.

15. And God which has promise^ to power water upon the thirsty, ^ stoods upon
the dry ground, t^ Isa. 44. 3.
power his Spirit upon the seed ^ his Church, and his blessing upon their buds;
will not only Luke 11. 13.
give the Holy Ghost to them that desi^ him; but also continue his gifts ^
graces for the assurance of the^ hearts; so that they shall not labou^ in vayn,
nor bring forth in fear, because Isa. 65. 23.
they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them. The
love of God is Romans 5. 5.
shed abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is give^ unto them, and by
him Ephesians. 4. 30.
are they sealed unto the day of redemption; the same Spirit Romans 8. 1^.
bears witness with their spirits that they are the Sons of God; and
hereby they 1. Ioh. 4. 13.
know that they dwell in God, and he in them, because he has given them of his
Spirit, which is as a (...) 2 Cor. 1. 22.
pawn or earnest in their hearts, whereby they do not only behold the glory of
the Lord with open face, but are 2 Cor. 3. 18.
changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the
Lord. And this Spirit which they have received, is not the Spirit of bondage to
fear again, (as at the Exodus 19. 16* and 34. 30.
giving of the Law, and looking upon Moses face,) but is the Spirit of Romans 8.
15.
adoption-of-children, whereby they cry Abba Father, even the Spirit of his Son
Christ, Gal. 4* 6.
which God has sent into their hearts, because they also are sons, and the Gal.
3. 14.
blessing of Abraham is come upon them through Christ Jesus. So Gods good
Spirit Psalm. 143. 10*
leads them unto the Lan^ of righteousness, and this is a part of his covenant
with them, tha^ Isa. 59. 21.
his Spirit which is upon them, an^ his words which he has put i^ their
mouth, shall not depart out ^ the mouth of them or their se^^ or their seeds
seed for ever. Neith^ will he hide his face any more from the^ Ezekiel. 39. 89.
because he has powered out his spirit upon the hense of Israel, as he hat^
promised by his Prophet. From a^ which proceeds unto the Saint unspeakable
peace comfort and joy which they find and feel, both ^ the receiving of the
word, (as the Apostle says 1. These. 1. 6.
ye received the wor^ in much affliction with joy of the holy Ghost;) in the
obedience the^ unto in the kingdom of God; which is Romans 14. 17.
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.

16. Amongst other benefits which the Spirit affords, this is one special,
that it helps the Saints infirmities in prayer; who ^ls know not what to
pray as they ^ught, but Romans 8. 26. 27.
the Spirit it self makes request for them* with sighs which cannot be
expressed; and the request which he makes is according to ^he will of God, who
sercheth the ^arts, and knows what the meaning of the Spirit is.

17. But that the Saints be not deceaved, and led astray from the truth, by
any motion, suggestion, vision, revelation, or other means whatsoever, as from
the Spirit of the Lord; our Savior has given us a rule, to discern the work
of his Spirit, from the delusion of Satan; which is this, that his Spirit John.
16. 13. 14.
speaks not of himself, but whatsoever he hears he speaks: that he
glorifieth Christ, for he receives of Christ's, (and verse. 15.
al things that the Father has at Christ's,) and shows it unto Christians.
Therefore is he the Spirit verse. 13.
of truth, and leads into altruth, because he teaches nothing but according
to the word of God, which word is John. 17. 17.
truth. And by that word must al spirits be tried; by it may be discerned the
Spirit of truth from the Spirit of error: and Joshua, though he were full of the
Spirit o^ Deuteronomy 34. 9.
wisdom; yet was charged of God to Ios. 1. 7. 8.
attend unto the book of the Law, (for his direction,) to obser^^ and do,
according to all that was written therein.

18. Finally, the Spirit of God, has generally in all things wrought much and
mightily in and by the Saints. With this was Exodus 31. 3. 4.
Bezaleel filled, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
workmanship, to find out curious works for the Lords Tabernacle; with this were
the Number. 11. 25
seventy Ancients furnished for the government of Israel, and prophesied. With
the wisdom of this Spirit, was Deuteronomy. 34. 9. Number. 27. 18. 20.
Joshua full, after that Moses had put his hands upon him, and given him of his
glory, when he ordained him to be his successor in the kingdom. And what
should I speak of all the Judges, as of Othoniel, of Gedeon, of ^ephte and of
Samson, upon whom the Iud. 3 10.
Spirit of the Lord came, (...). 6. 34. and 11. 29. and 13. 25 and 14. 6. 1^.
clothed them, strengthened them, and prospered upon them; whereby they went
boldly unto great battles, overcame their enemies, and ^ent the wild beasts
that roared upon them. The Prophets also and Apostles, were Eze 2. 2. and 3.
14. 24. and 37. 1. Act. 8. 29. 39. and 10 19. 20. and 13 2. 4 and 16. 6 7. and
20. 22. and 21. 4.
carried and guyded by the Spirit, in their ways words, and works; taught whom
for to go to, and from whom to refreyn; and had great intelligence of things
Act. 11. 28.
for to come; and in every city, the Act. 20. 2^*
Holy Ghost witnessed, such things as Gods wisdom saw good to revele. So that
the help which the Spirit ministers to the Saints, is infinite and
incomprehensible; and they may say to the Lord with the Prophet, Psalm. 13 9. 7.
whishal I go from thy Spirit? for lo, the wisdom of God Prove. 1. 23.
powers out her Spirit unto them, and makes them understand her words: this 1
Ioh. 2. 20.
Ointment they have from him that is holy, and do know al things: through the
power of the Holy Ghost they Romans 15. 13.
abound in hope; by the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they and the Act. 9. 31,
Churches of them are multiplied and by him the Romans 15. 16.
offering up of the Gentiles (by the ministry of the Gospel) is sanctified: and
whatsoever good thing is done among Gods people, is not by an Army nor
strength, but Zach. 4. 6.
by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, without which 1 Cor. 12 3.
no man can say, that Jesus is the Lord.

19. Thus ar the Saints of God, advanced to honor and dignity, above al
peoples on the earth; being themselves the 1 Cor. 3. 1^.
Temple of God, and having his Spirit dwelling in them: enjoying a most holy
and happy communion, 1 Ioh. 1. 3.
with the Father, and with his son Jesus Christ, and with 2 Cor. 13. 13
the Holy Ghost; the grace and peace and comfort whereof, passes al
understanding, and can no way be sufficiently expressed, by the tongue or pen
of man. And this holy communion with his people God showed of old by his
prophet, in these gracious words, Hag. ^. ^. 6.
I am with you says the Lord of hosts with the Christ. Ioh. 1. 1.
Word, by whom I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt; and my Spirit
remaining among you: Fear you not.

Al thy works praise thee, o Lord; and thy Saints bless thee.

Psalm. 145. 10. CHAP. XIIII.
How the fores^yd communion and peace between God and his Sainsts, is sometimes
interrupted by their syns: what unrest and trouble, they then feel in
themselves; and how their ancient peace is renewed.

Because there is Eccl. 7. 22. 2. Chron. 6. 36
no man just in the earth, that does good and sins not; and whiles men dwell
in these howses of clay, they be compassed about with their own infirmities,
tempted of their own concupiscences, and besett with Divils, that always lie
in wayt to entrap and devour: it falls out, that the Saints of God are not
only assaulted, but oftentimes foiled by their enemies, and do fall into snares,
and loathsome trespasses, whereby God is dishonored, the Divil delighted, and
their own hearts wounded and distressed.

2. For our knowledge in this life, is but 1 Cor. 13. 9. 12.
in part; so that through error and ignorance we often do amiss; neither can any
man Psalm. 19. 12.
understand or discern those errors. Our affections and lusts are not fully
subdued, but do yet Iam. 4. ^.
war in our members; the flesh Gal. 5. 17.
lusts against the spirit, and these 1 Pet. 2. 11.
lusts fight against the soul, and ar as a Romans 7. 23.
law in our members, rebelling against the law of our mind, and captivating us
to the law of syn which is in our members. Our strength is infirm; and though
we would do good, yet ver. 1^.
find we no means to perform it. Our enemy Satan, is both subtle and strong,
and seeks daily to circumvent us, and often prevails through our weakness
and vnheedines, that in Iam. 3. 2.
many things we syn al, and no man can say Prove. 20. 9.
I have purified my heart, I am clean from my syn.

3. Sometime the pleasures of the flesh, do bewitch and draw us into greevous
offenses; Genesis 9. 21.
drunkenness, 2 Samuel 11. 4 1 King. 11. 1. 2. 3. 4.
adultery, fornication, murder, and idolatry it self; sometime the blessings
of God upon us, do make us proud, our 2 Chronicles. 32. 25.
hearts are lifted up, we commit 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. 2 etc.
vainglorious actions, forgetting Luke 15. 13. 17.
our selves, and Deuteronomy. 32. 18 15.
God that begat us, even forsaking the Rock of our salvation; sometime our
affections are so stirred, that we fall into intemperance 1 Samuel 25. 23. 21. 22.
31. 32. 33. 34. 2 Chro. 16. 10. Psalm. 106. 32. 33. Act 7. 9. Gen 49. 7.
both in word and work, not only against men, but even Ion. 4. 1. 4. 9. etc.
God himself; sometime fears, doubts, dangers, threatenings, and afflictions, do
Exodus 14. 10. Isa. 7. 2. Mat. 14. 30. 31.
daunt and discourage us, making the heart to faint, the tongue to deny Mat. 26.
70. 72. 74.
and forswear the truth, the hands Ex. 32. 2. 4. 22. 2^. etc.
to work impiety, our faith to quail, that we forsake Christ and Mat. 26. 56.
flee away. Yea Gods children have in error and blind zele, persecuted the
truth and professors thereof, even killed Christ himself, and crucified the
Lord of Glory; as the example of Act. 9. 1. etc and Act. 2. 22. 23. 29. 36. 38
39.
Saul and sondrie other elect Israelites does manifest. These and many like
greevous syns do the Saints sometimes fall into through their infirmities,
(God withdrawing his hand, and leaving them to themselves,) besides their
ignorances and defaults which multiply daily: so as they surmount in number
Psalm. 40. 12.
the hayres of their heads. And many times such me^ lie sleeping in their syns
As the former examples of the Patriarchs show.
long, forgetting themselves in their voluptuous delights; til God awakeneth
them of his grace, least they should sleep the death, and perish for ever.

4. He awakeneth us sometime by the sound of 2 Samuel 1^. 1 -- 7 -- 13. Act* 2. 37.
his word, knocking at the door of our hearts; and by his Neb. 9. 30.
Spirit wherewith he Genesis 6. 3.
striveth in us: sometime by Job. 33. 16. 17. 19. etc. Ion 1. 17. and 2. 1. 2.
etc.
corrections and punishments for our misdeedes inflicted upon our bodies;
sometime by ^ Sam 24. 10. Psalm. 38. 3 8. 10.
striking our consciences with dread dismay and terror for our syns, and
withdrawing the cheerful light of his countenance from us, so as we feel not
the joy of his spirit, neither have peace in our selves; but the comfortable
communion betwee^ his Majesty and us, seems quite to be disanulled and
broken.

5. For he withdraws his face and favor from us, Job. 19. 11.
kindles his anger against us, and cou^teth us as his enemies, the horror of
his wrath is as fire sent from above into our bones; the curse Dan. 9. 1^.
written in the law, is powered upon us, and is as the arrows of the Almighty,
the venim whereof drinks up our spirit. He Psalm. 90. 8.
sets our iniquities before him self, and our secret syns in the light of
his countenance; he sets them also in our own sight, and our syn is Psalm.
51. 3.
before us continually; with his hand he Lam. 1. 14.
binds the yoke of our transgressions, and with them being wrapped and laid
upon our neck, he makes our strength to fayl; Job. 13. 26.
bitter things does he write against us, and make us to inherit the iniquities
of our youth; so as there is Psalm. 38. 3. 5 7.
nothing found in our flesh because of his anger; neither is there rest in our
bones because of our sin: our wounds stink and ar corrupt, our reins ar full of
burning, our heart is Psalm. 22. 14.
as wax, it melts in the mids of our bowels; our bones are parched Psalm. 102
3.
like an hearth, and our Psalm. 32. 40
moisture is turned to a summers drowth, so heavy is his hand upon us night and
day. Then cry we out for grief of heart, we rore like bears, and mourn like
doves; looking for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far
from us; because our trespasses are many both before him and our selves, for
which his terrors do fight against us, he visits us Isa. 59. 11, 12.
every Job. 7. 18.
morning, and tries us every moment; sets us as a mark against him, so that
we are a burden to our selves. Also when we cry and shout, Lam. 3. 8.
he shuts out our prayer, and is even Psalm. 80. 4.
angry against it; because our Isa. 59. 2.
iniquities have separated between us and him, and our syns have hid his face
from us, that he will not hear; so loathsome are our trespasses unto him, so
venomous to our selves is the biting of those fiery serpents.

6. Then are we left comfortless and desolate, cast down in our selves, our
soul powered out upon us, Job. 30. 15. 16
and our salvation passed away as a clowd; we are kept out of the paradise of
God with the terror of his law and judgments, as with the Genesis 3. 24. Psalm. 88.
6. 7
blade of the Cherubims brandishing sword; we are laid in the lowest pit, in
darkness, in the deep; where Gods indignation lies upon us, and we are vexed
with all his waves. We are a reproach to wicked men, who because of our misdeeds
do 2. Sam. 1^. 14.
blaspheme: we are a scorn to the Divils, who insult at our syns, cease not to
accuse us before Rev. 12. 10.
God day and night, and hope to have us in the end, a prey to their teeth. Our
Psalm. 38. 18
lovers and our friends stand a side from our plague, and our kinsmen stand far
off. They that should guide and direct us to Christ, in sted of good counsel do
often Song. 3. 3. and 5. 7.
smite and wound us, persecuting them whom God has smitten, Psalm. 69. 26
and adding to their sorrows whom he has wounded. The worm of our own
conscience continually biteth us, so as when we would Job. 9. ^7. 2^
forget our complaint, and comfort our selves; then ar we afraid of al our
sorrows, knowing that God will not judge us innocent, who Job. 10. ^.
inquireth of our iniquity and sercheth out our syn; yet Job. 13. 24.
hides his face, and reputeth us for his enemies. Thus our sowl Lam. 3. 17. 18.
is far off from peace, we have forgotten prosperity, saying, Our strength and
our hope is perished from the Lord; and Job. 3. 20.
wherefore is the light given to them that are in misery, and life unto the^
that have heavy hearts? for our harp is turned to mourning; Job. 30. 31.
and our organs, into the voice of them that weep.

7 But the Job. 19. 28.
root of the word which is found in us, and the 1. John. 3. 9.
^eed of God which remains in us; stirs up the spark of faith, and
suffers it not to dye in these distresses. It brings to mind Gods ancient
mercies, his faith confirmed, and love sealed toward us in Christ; it tells
us, where syn abounds, Romans 5. 20
grace does abound much more. Then remembering our song in the night, communing
with our own heart, and our spirit serching diligently, we say, Psalm. 77. 6. 7.
8.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever? and will he show no more favor*? Is his
mercy clean gone for ever? does his promise fayl for evermore? has God
forgotten to be merciful? has he shut up his tender mercies in displesure? we
have sinned, Job. 7. 20.
what shall we do unto thee, o thou preserver of men? If thou straightly Psalm.
130. 3. 4.
markest iniquities, Lord who shall stand? surely then the Job. 14. 18.
mountain would fall and come to naught, and the rock would be removed from his
place; neither shall any Psalm. 143. ^.
that lives be justified in thy sight. But mercy is with thee, that thou may
be feared. And now Lord thou art our Isa. 64. 8. ^^
Father; we are the clay, and thou art the potter, we al are the work of thine
hands; be not angry o Lord above measure, neither remember iniquity for ever;
purge thou us with hyssope and we shall be clean, Psalm. 51. 7. ^
wash us and we shall be whiter then snow; make us to hear joy and gladness, that
the bones which thou have broken may rejoice, turn us again o God of Psalm.
80. 3. 7 1 ^
hosts, and cause thy face to shine, that we may be saved.

8. When thus we shall submit our selves under the mighty hand of God, and
drawing waters from the well of our hearts, 1 Samuel 7. 6. Lam. ^. 19.
shall power them out before the Lord: when we shall confess our iniquities, and
in faith ask mercy at his hands, hu^gring and thirsting after his righteousness,
and Psalm. 42. 1.
braying for it as the hind for the rivers of waters: the Lord will Deu. 32. 36.
repent toward his servants, when he sees that their power is gone; he will
Isa. 44. 3.
power water upon the thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, and will say
unto us, Isa. 41. 10.
Fear not for I am with you; be not afraid, for I am your God, I will strengthen
you and help you and susteyn you with the right hand of my justice; though Isa.
1. 18.
your syns were as crimsin, they shall be made white as snow, though they were
red like scarlet, they shall be as wool: for a little while I have forsaken you,
Isa. 54. 7. 8.
but with great compassion will I gather you; for a moment in anger I hid my
face from you for a little season, but with everlasting mercy have I had
compassion on you, says the Lord your redeemer. Then shall we see in the black
cloud of our tribulations, the Genesis 9. 13. 14.
bow of the Lord, even himself will appear with the Eze. 1. 28. Rev. 4. 3.
rayn-bow about his throne, the token of his covenant of grace, which he
remembers; and as he swear that the waters of Noah should no more go over
the earth, Isa. 54. 9. 10
so swears he not to be angry with us nor rebuke us; though the mountains
remove, and the hills fall down, yet his mercy shall not depart from us, nor the
covenant of his peace fall away.

9. Thus God which had wounded Hos. 6. 1. 2.
us, binds us up; after two days [troubles] he reviveth us, in the third day
he raises us up and we live in his sight; he Psalm. 147. 3.
heals our broken hearts, and binds up our sores. For Christ our mediator,
that Angel of the covenant, has asked for us mercy of God his Father, who was
so long displeased with us, and Isa. 32. 2.
the Lord has answered him with good and comfortable words; this man is unto
us, as Zec. 1. 12. 13
an hiding place from the wind, and as a secret from the tempest; as rivers of
waters in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. And
though our bark has been tossed in the sea of afflictions, where Christ
himself seemed Mat. 14. 24. 26. 27. 32.
to us a spright, and made us afraid; yet now his gracious voice does comfort
us, and his presence cease al wind and tempest. It is he, even he that Isa.
43. 25.
puts away our iniquities for his own sake, and reme^breth not our syns; but
restores to us the Psalm. 51. 12.
joy of his salvation, gives us Isa. 61. 3.
bewty for ashes, the oil of joye for mourning, the garment of gladness for the
spirit of heavines; so that Psalm. 103. 5. Isa. 40. 31.
our youth is renewed, and we lift up the wings as the Eagles; our Job. 33. 23.
flesh is as fresh as a child's; strength is Psalm. 138. 3.
increased in our sowles; and being now as widows divorced Romans 7. 1. 2. 3 --
6.
from our syns, delivered from that law; and returned to our Fathers house,
like the Lev. 22. 13.
Priests daughters we eat of our Fathers bread, as we did in our youth; we shall
feel no Isa. 49. 10.
more hunger, nor thirst, neither shall the heat smite on us, nor the sun; God
wipeth Rev. 21. 4.
al tears from our eyes, there is no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor
pain; for the first things are passed.

10 Having thus after long seeking Song. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4.
found him whom our sowlloveth, we take hold upon him, and leav him ^ot, til we
have brought him home unto us; and after this nights Gen 32. 24. etc.
wrestling with the Angel, we will not let him go, until he bless us, and giv
unto weak Iaakob the new name of Israel; for that by strong faith we have power
with God and prevail, Hos. 12. 3. 4.
having wept and prayed unto him. And now he puts in our mouth, a Psalm. 40,
3. and 51. 14. and 103. 1, 2. 3.
new song of praise unto our God; our tongues sing joyfully of his justice, and
our sowles do bless him, which has pardoned al our iniquities, healed al our
infirmities, redeemed our life from the pit, and crowned us with mercy and
compassions. And because we beleev, therefore we speak and say, ^sa. 118. 17. 18.
We shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord; the Lord has
chastened us sore, but has not delivered us to death. Wherefore after our
agonies and conflicts with death, terrors within, and fears round about; we
repose in Christ our redemer, who has taken away our syns, va^quisht al our
foes, put Satan to flight, renewed our peace, and quieted our consciences: and
then we rejoice and say, Psalm. 116. 7.
My soul return unto thy rest, for the Lord has been bountiful unto thee.

11. Then gives he us to see, how in all these troubles and torments, we have
most near communion with Christ, and are by them made comfortable unto him; for
he was wounded for our Isa. 53. 5.
transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities, innumerable Psalm. 40. (...).
troubles compassed him, the syns of the elect, which by imputatio^ were his,
took such hold upon him that he was not able to look up; for the Lord (...)
laid upon him the iniquity of us al; though he had done no wickedness, neither
was any deceyt in his mouth, yet the Lord would break him and make him subject
to infirmities, so that he felt (...)
terror and anguish, and heavines in his sowl even unto the death; his sweat
in his agony was like (...)
drops of blood trickling down to the ground, and his cry unto his God was,
(...)
why have thou forsaken me? And we in our afflictions do but drink of his cup,
and are baptized but with his baptism; that after we have suffered with him, we
may also reign with him, and by many tribulations (...)
must we enter into his kingdom. And he that was thus smitten of God, and
humbled even to the death; thus troubled in sowl, and left of his Father for a
season; found an issue out of al tentations, not for himself alone, but for us
whose surety he was; who therefore have this hope for an anchor to our sowles,
that as we now suffer with him, so shall we also reign with him, notwithstanding
that for the present we are brought into the dust of death.

12. After this, admiring the mercies of our God, and the unsearchable depth of
his counsels, who works and turns al things, even our own syns unto our
good; who leads us in such ways and wildernesses, where fyrie Deuteronomy. 8. 15.
serpents and scorpions are, and drought without water; which makes us follow
him when his Psalm. 77. 19.
way is in the sea, and his paths in the great waters, and his footsteps are not known; in all which dangers he defends us, and afterward brings us
into his rest: we say the Lord dwells 2 Chro. 6. ^.
in a dark clowd, Isa. 45. 15.
Verily thou o God hidest thy self, o God the savior of Israel; how
unsearchable ar thy judgments, and thy ways past finding out? Then minding our
frayl estate in this flesh, how we are Romans 7. 14. 15-18.
sold under syn, and do trespass against God every day, and cannot do the good
that we would* we abase our horns unto the dust, and by repentance do die
daily, washing Christ's feet with our tears, knowing that notwithstanding the
communion that we have with him here by faith, yet are we but strangers and
pilgroms on earth, and whiles we are ^ Cor. 5. 6.
at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord; whiles our Job. 14. ^2.
flesh is upon us we shall be sorrowful, and whiles our soul is in us, it shall
mourn. Therefore Is^. 35. 3. Heb, 12. 12. 13
strengthening our weak hands and comforting our feeble knees, we make straight
steps unto our feet, being careful and circumspect least Satan further
circumvent us, seeking to make an end of our salvation with Phil. 2. 12.
fear and trembling, giving all diligence 2 Pet. 1. 5. ^^
to ioyn virtue with our faith, and to make our caling and election sure; for
behold Pro. 11. 38. 1 Pet. 4. 18.
the righteous have [for their syns] recompense in the earth and are scarcely
saved, where then shall the ungodly and sinner appear? but we which beleev in
Christ, exspect with patience our full redemtion, and as we have Psalm. 55. 22.
cast our burden on the Lord, and Psalm. 10. 14.
committed our poor selves unto him; so we are persuaded 2 Timothy 1. 12.
that he is able to keep that which is committed unto him against that day,
even to Jude. ver. ^^
keep us that we fall not, and to present us faultles before the presence of
his glory with joy; where we shall always behold his face, and being quite
freed from our syns, and from al possibility of ever synning more; shall
perpetually serve and honor him, with his Angels at his right hand, where
Psalm. 16. 11.
pleasures ar for evermore.

He that walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of
the Lord, and stay upon his God.

Isa. 50. 10. CHAPT. XV.
Of the communion that the Saints have in this life with Angels.

The name of Angel, which is in English a Messe^ger, is in ye scriptures
attributed, 1. to our Lord Christ; 2. to the spiritual creatures in heaven; 3.
and to some certain men on earth, employed in the message and service of God.

2. Christ, is the Angel whom God Number. 20. 16 1 Cor. 10. 9.
sent to bring Israel out of Aegipt, in whom Exodus 23. 20. 21.
Gods name is, and is therefore caled the Angel Isa. 63. 9.
of his Face or Presence, even the Exo. 34. 14.
Face of God it self; the Mal. ^. ^.
Angel of the Covenant, whom the Israelites desired; the Angel that Genesis 48.
116. (...) (...) Redemer; the title of Christ.
delivered Iaakob from al evil; the Angel that Deuteronomy. 33. 116 Exodus 8. 2. 6.
dwelt in the bush, whiles it burned and was not consumed; who was the God of
Abraham Isaak and Iaakob; the Judge. 6. 11^. 14. 16 (...)
Angel Jehovah, who emboldned Gedeon to battle against the Madianits, and was
with him in the same; the Angel with the golden censer Rev. 68. 68. ^.
that gives many odours to the prayers of all Saints, and out of whose hand
the odours with the prayers go up before God in his throne. He is no created
Angel, but the Colos. 11. 1^6
creator of Angels, and all other things in heaven and earth; therefore is he
the Jude. ver. ^.
Archangel, the Col. 2. 10.
head of al principality and power the Dan. 10. 113.
first of the chief Princes, even Revel. 12. 7. Dan. 10. 21.
Michael our prince, whom Heb. 1. 6.
all the Angels of God do worship. Of him and our communion with him is before
spoken.

3. The ministers of God, though me^ on the earth, yet for the service wherein
they be employed ar caled Angels or Messengers. Such were the priests in the
time of the Law, as Malachie Mal. 2. 7.
intitleth them; such was Mat. 11. 10
John Baptist; and such ar Christ's ordinary ministers the Rev. 1. 20. and 2. 1
etc. and often in that book
Angels of the Churches. Of whom it remains to be spoken otherwhere.

4. The blessed spirits which are about the throne of God, where Dan. 7. 10.
thousand thowsands minister unto him, and ten thousand thowsands stand before
him; these heavenly creatures being often sent forth into this world on Gods
message, are therefore most properly and usually caled Angels. Of the^ do we
treat in this place. These ar 2. Sam. 14. 20.
wise and Psalm. 103. 20
excel in strength, and in all ready and swift performance of the will of God;
They are Col. 1. 16.
Thrones; Dominions, principalities, and powers, they are the Dan. 10. 13.
chief princes above all the princes of the earth; and the title of Psalm. 8. 5.
and 97. 7. with Heb. 1. 6. and 2. 6. 7.
Gods is given unto them: God imparteth 1. king. 22. 19. 20. Zach. 1. 10. 11.
etc.
to them his counsels and uses their ministry in the government of the world.

5. These heavenly creatures, ar parties in the communion of the Saints, as is
Chap. 4. Sect 3.
before touched; for they and we have al one head Col. 2. 10. and 1. 18.
which is Christ, and are al 1. Tim. 5. 2^
elect to be partakers of the glory of God for ever. But because they are Heb.
1. 7.
spirits, and have not flesh and blood as we; therefore the fellowship between
them and us is spiritual, to be learned out of the scriptures, and discerned by
faith, not by ey-sight. Again God has in ages past, before ye incarnation of
Christ, more employed them outwardly in reveling his will unto men, then in
these last days he does; since he has opened unto us the whole mystery of
his counsel, Heb. 1. 1.
by his Son. Yet as at the giving of the Law, when the Lord came from mount
Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto his people, he came with Deuteronomy. 33. 2.
ten thowsands of the Saints: so in the time of the Gospel, when his feet
stood on the mount of Olives, the Lord our God came, and Zech. 14. 4. 5
all the Saints with him, to do him worship Mar. 1. 13.
and minister unto him; to guard Rev. 9. 11.
his throne and church; and to be sent forth in ministry Heb. 1. 14.
for their sakes which shall be heirs of salvation.

6. Sometimes the Angels appeared in visible forms of Genesis 18. 2. etc. and 19.
1. etc. Heb. 13. 2
men, and for a while so conversed with men, eating and drinking, and talking
familiarly of the matters wherabout they were sent; as in the history of
Abraham and Lot is to be seen. Sometimes they appeared in more glorious shapes,
like Isa. 6. 2. 6. 7 Dan. 8. 15. 17 and 9. 21. 22.
winged creatures, and so would treat with men about their affairs vocally:
but their celestial majesty, then much daunted the sons of Adam. Sometimes
they appeared, Genesis 28. 12.
but spoke not; and again sometime they spoke, Act. 8. 26.
when no mention is made of their appearing.

7. The causes also and effects of their appearing, were many and weighty. For
by them Abraham was told of the Genesis 18. 10. 17. 20.
birth of Isaak; and the destruction of Sodom; Manoah and his Judge. 13.
wife, of ye birth of Sa^son; Zecharie, of ye Luke 1. 13.
birth of John Baptist; Mary, Luke 1. 30. 32
of ye co^ceptio^, and ye shepherds, Luke 2. 10.
of y^ birth of our Lord Christ; the women Mark. 16. 1. 5. 6.
of his resurrection; and the Apostles, Act. 1. 10. 11
of his second coming at the last day. By them Zecharie was Zech. 2. 3. 4*
certified of the restoration of Jerusalem; Daniel Dan. 7. 10. 16. etc. and 8.
13. 15. 17. and ^ and 9. 21. etc. and 10. 5. 6. etc.
was informed of the state of the church from his time to Revel. 1. 1^ etc.
unto Chap. 22. 6. 16.
Christ; and John, of the * estate thereof, from his days, to the worlds end.
By them, Lot Genesis 19.
was delivered from the burning of Sodom; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Dan.
3. 28.
from the fyrie furnace; Daniel, Dan. 6. 22.
from the Lions mouths; and Peter, Act. 12. 7. etc.
out of Herod's prison. By them, Abraham's servant, was Genesis 24. 7. 40.
guided in his journey; Philip, was directed to go Act. 8. 26. 29
and preach to the Eunuch; Paul Act 16. 9. 10.
to the Macedonians; Iaakob, was encouraged Genesis 28. 12. and 32. 1. 2. 11 24.
in his going toward, and retourning from Mesopotomia, Eliah, was 1 king. 19.
5. 6. 7.
refreshed with food in his flight from Iezebel; Joseph Mat. 2. 13.
was counseled to flee with Christ, from Herod's persecution; and Paul Act. 27.
23. 24.
was comforted against peril of shipwreck. Their ministry was used at Gal. 3.
19. Act. 7. 53.
the giving of the fyrie law on mount Sinai; their melody was heard at the
Luke 2. 13. 14.
birth of the Lamb, that reigns on mount Sion; and they still sing loud Rev.
5. 11. 12
his praises about Gods throne; and they shall be the harvestmen to Mat. 13. 39
41. and 24. 31
reap the earth and to sever the bad from among the just, at the end of this
world.

8. They are Gods powrful instruments as for smiting Psalm. 78. 4^ Act. 12. 23.
the wicked with sore diseases; so for the help and healing of our sicknesses,
when it pleases God so to employ them: as appears by that famous miracle,
often wrought in the pool at Jerusalem, whose waters were at certain times
troubled by an Angel; after which stirring, who so first stepped in, was made
whole of whatsoever disease he had. In memory of which heavenly grace, the
place was caled Ioh. 5. 2. 4. etc.
Beth-esda, that is the house of bountifulnes or mercy.

9. And although now a days they appear not visibly, nor afford us such
outward help: yet are these heavenly messengers, still secretly employed for the
safeguard and benefit of the Saints. For who so dwells in the secret of the
Most high, and lodges in the shadow of the Almighty; over him (as the Psalm.
91. 1. 11
Psalmist says,) God gives his Angels charge to keep him in all his ways:
yea even unto Mat. 18. 10.
little children does their care extend, and as the embroydred Exodus 26. 1.
Cherubims environed the Tabernacle, so do those heavenly soldjers compass
and guard Gods true tabernacle the Church. And whereas we are in danger two
manner wise, 1. by our own infirmity, 2. and our enemies might and subtlety:
these Dan. 4. 14.
watchmen and guardians Heb. 1. 14.
of our salvation, do succor us in both. For as the mother, carries in her
arms the child which cannot well go; so these do Psalm. 91. 12.
bear-vs-vp in their hands, that we hurt not our foot against a stone; and when
we are besieged by our foes, these Psalm. 34. 7.
pitch round about us, and deliver us; being as a bulwark betwixt the fiends,
even all our enemies, and us. So that if God gave us to see with the eye, as we
are taught to beleev by faith; we might behold with Elishaes servant 2. king.
6. 17
the mountains to be full of horses and charets of fire round about us: and
would say with Iaakob, Genesis 32. 1. ^.
This is Gods host. Neither do they only save us from peril; but as heavenly
warriors that excel in strength, they Dan. 10. 20.
fight against our enemies, pursuing and Psalm. 35. 1. 5 6.
scattering them, as chaff before the wind; like as at Hezekiahs prayer, Isa.
37. 21. (...) 36.
an Angel came and killed 185. thousand of his foes. And as they attend upon us
in our life, so do they also at our death; being sent to fetch our flitting
souls, and carry the^ into Luke 16. 22.
Abraham's bosom, in the Paradise of God.

10. These things as those blessed spirits the Job. 1. 6. and 38. 7.
sons of God, do at the commandment of their heavenly father, Psalm. 103. ^0
Mat. 6. 10.
redily and cheerfully, for his elect: so also ar they beholders of our ways
and conversation, and affected (after their spiritual manner) with the things
they see in us. For they are, eve^ the thousand Rev. 5. 1^. 12
thowsa^ds of the^, as about Gods throne, so about the four living creatures
and the 24. Elders, together with them magnifiing Christ the killed Lamb, and
prostrate on their faces do worship God, Rev. 7. 11. 12.
and giv glory unto him for evermore. Into the celestial mysteries reveled by
the Gospel, they have a 1 Pet. 1. 12.
desire to look; because God has by his church Ephesians. 3. 10.
made known his manifold wisdom unto them. Loving also they are, glad and
desirous of our good; as appears by their glorifying of the Lamb that was
killed for us, not for them; and by the joy which they have, when any one of us
converteth from our syns; as Christ Luke 15. 7. 10
has showed. Witnesses they are with the Lord, of the charges and contestations
laid upon us, for the observing of our duties; as by 1 Timothy 5 21.
the Apostles words to Timothee, we be taught. Wherefore we ought holily,
righteously, and soberly to carry our selves, in all our actions; seeing we are a
spectacle to those heavenly Psalm. 104. 4.
Flames, and Heb. 12. (...).
are come to the great assembly of innumerable of them: yea the Apostle
seems to require of 1 Cor. 11. 10.
women, modest and submissiveattire, in respect of them.

11. All this notwithstanding, we must take heed, both of superstition, and
curiosity about them; for we are forbidden of God the Colos. 2. 18.
religion or worship of Angels: which when John for the revelations showed him
would have done; the Angel refused, and said, Rev. 22. 8. ^
See thou do it not. If therefore we have need of succor let us pray unto Mat.
26. 53.
our Father, and he can send us legions of them; and if we would giv thanks for
their help, and offer a sacrifice; themselves Judge. 13. 16.
have taught us, to offer it to the Lord; whose servants they are, even Rev. 22.
9.
fellow servants with us; though much more excellent, able, and obedient. He it
is, that sends them forth, for our sakes which are heyrs of salvation; he also
will change this our corruptible estate, and cloth us with immortality, and
make us Luke 20. 36.
equal to those holy Angels, and giv us ^ place Zech. 3. 7.
among them: whose communion at that day we shall fully enjoy, together with
them serving our God, and lauding his Majesty, in his own blessed presence for
ever.

The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them that fear him, and delivers
them.

Psalm. 34. 7. CHAPT. XVI.
How the Saints on earth, ar caled to a holy communion among themselves.

God who has chosen and caled us in Christ from this world, and fellowship of
al wicked ones therein, to be his, and to serve him: has further required at our
hands, that we which are caled, should not live alone, or a sunder by our
selves, but join together, and so entertayn and nourish, a loving and holy
communion one with an other, in the unity of the faith and spirit, by the bond
of peace. For man is made a sociable creature; and when he was in his
perfection, God saw and said, it was Genesis 2. 18.
not good for him to be alone, and therefore made him a help meet for him: but
after, when we were corrupted, there was much more need of fellowship one with
an other for our mutal help and comfort. And many are the benefits which we
reap hereby; eve^ as on the contrary, the evils, dangers, and discomforts,
which arise for want hereof, are more then can be told.

2. When God had brought his people out of Egypt, to lead them into Canaan;
whiles thither they were traveyling, even in the wilderness caused he a Tent to
be made, for himself Exodus 25. 8.
to dwell among them, and in midds of their tents; which when it was perfected,
he took possession of, Exodus 40. 34
filled and sanctified it with his glory; commanded also the people; Lev. 1.
3. and 4. 4. etc.
thither for to bring their services and their sacrifices; promised there Exodus
29. 42 43.
to meet with the^, to speak there unto them; whereupon that place was caled the
Tent (or Tabernacle) of ver. 42 44. (...)
Meeting or Congregation. And whereas this Sanctuary was flitting and moveable
not only in the Number. 4. 4. and. 10. 7. etc.
wilderness, but also in Ios. 5. 10. and 18. 1. 1. Chro^. 15. 1.
the land of Canaan: therefore God gav Israel a charge by Moses, that they
should seek Deuteronomy. 12. ver. 5. 6.
the place which he should choose out of al their tribes, to put his Name
there, and there to dwell; that thither they should come, to sacrifice, and
rejoice before the Lord; themselves ver. 12. 13. 14.
their children, and their servants; there to keep Deuteronomy. 16. ^. 11. 15. 16.
their solemn feasts, and take heed they offered not in any other place. For he
had told the^, whosoever, Israelite or stranger sojourning among them, that
resorted not to this Tabernacle with his oblations, but sacrificed other where,
either within or without the host, that man should be reputed Levit. 17. 3. 4.
7. 8. 9.
as if he had shed blood, or offered unto Divils; and was to be cut off from
among his people. This tent, (together with the Ternple which for like ^.
Chron. 2. ^*
holy use, succeeded the same,) was a figure of the church or congregation of
Christians, amongst whom God has placed his Rev. 21. 3. Ezekiel. 37. 27 28.
tabernacle, to dwell as their God with them, and they to be his people, even
his Heb. 3. 6.
house and habitation; and should therefore Mat. 18. 20.
gather themselves together in his name, to keep their spiritual 1 Cor. 5. 4. 8
Nahum. 1. 15
feasts, not withdrawing from, nor leaving Heb. 10. 25.
the mutual assembling or fellowship that they have among themselves; for who
so repayreth not to the Church the true Jerusalem, of all the families of the
earth, there to Zech. 14. 16 17.
keep the feast of Tabernacles, and worship the king the Lord of hosts; no rayn
(of Gods grace or blessing) shall come upon them.

3. This gathering together of the Saints, is not a bare assembly or concourse
only, of people; but a near uniting and knitting of themselves, in one holy
communion and fellowship. For as the foresaid Tent was made of many courtaines,
but al of the^ so coupled one to another, with loops and taches, that they were
but Ex. 26. 1^^^
one Tabernacle; and as the 1 Kin. 5. 17. and 6. 7. 12. 13
many costly hewed stones, wherewith Solomon built the Temple, when they were
laid together, made one House wherein God had his habitatio^: so the servants
of Christ though they be many, yet are so built Ephs. 2. 21. 22.
and coupled together by faith, that they grow unto an holy temple in the Lord,
to be the habitation of God by the spirit; and are builded as a city Psalm.
122. 3.
that is compact together in it self. Which near conjunction is further set
sorth, by similitude of a body, wherein there be many members of several shape
and use, yet by the wisdom of God so united and set together, that there
appears a goodly frame and proportion of the man; and every lim so fastened to
other, and all the parts so serviceable needful and comfortable each to other,
that they cannot without pain, loss, and deformity be pulled asunder: even so
the Saints of God, ar (as the Apostle says) Romans 12. 5.
one body in Christ, and every one, one another members; being by one 1 Cor.
12. 13
spirit al baptized into one body; which is caled Christ's Ephesians. 1. 22. 23
Church or Congregation, because we are gathered and joined together unto him
our head, Ephesians. 4. 15. 16.
by whom all the body being coupled and knit together by every joint, for the
furniture thereof, (according to the effectual power which is in the mesure of
every part,) receives increase of the body unto the edifying of it self in
love.

4. The strength and virtue of this union of the Saints, proceeds from the
unity of their Faith and spirit. For faith is the Act. 14. 27.
door, by which we have entry and access both unto Romans 5. ^.
God, and into Act. 2. 44.
his Church or assembly, which thereupon is caled the Act 4. 32.
multitude of the faithful, or believers; even the Gal. 6. 10.
howshold of faith. And as by it we e^ter into this society so being entered,
we there build up Jude. ver 2^ Heb. 10. 38
our selves in our most holy faith; by it we * live, by it we Romans 11. 20.
stand, by it we al ar the Gal. ^* 26. 7 29.
sons of God, the seed of Abraham, and consequently heyrs by promise, of the
blessed inheritance, and so do enter into Heb. 4. 3.
his rest. Which faith because it is Ephesians. 4. 5.
one as the Lord is one, and is by his holy spirit communicated with all the
Saints; it is therefore caled the Tit. 1. 4.
commune faith, from which, the communion Philem. ver. 6.
of faith, that is of al Christian duties do flow; and especially is seen in
our conversing together, for the better performance of them. For as Christ
prayed, that they which should belev in him, might Ioh. 17. 20. 21. 22.
al be one, as the Father and He were one, in and with another; so the effect
of that his prayer appears in the union and communion of the first believers
which were of one ha^^ and of one Act. 4. 32. and 2.
sowl, and continued daily with one accord Acts. 2. 42. 44. 45. 46.
their meetings and fellowships for duties both spiritual and humane. Of which
happy day the Lord did foretell by his prophets saying, Ier. 32. 39.
I will giv them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever, for the
wealth of them and of their children after them; and Eze. 37. 22
I w^^ make them one people, in the land, upon the mou^tains of Israel; and one
king shall be king to the^ al; and they shall be no more two peoples, nor divided
any more henceforth into two kingdoms. This fellowship ought al men to labor
that they may come unto; and being come, there to abide; Ephesians. 4. 3.
endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, and Phil. 1.
27.
to continue in one spirit and in one mind, fighting together through the
faith of the Gospel.

5. The causes why God requires this gathering and knitting together of our
selves, are these. First for the better service of his Majesty, which he most
esteems when it is done of us with joint consent and agreement, that we with
one mind Romans ^5. 6.
and one mouth, praise God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and (as
the prophet says) serve him Zeph. 3. 9.
with one shoulder. And for this cause, at the first constitution of the Church
of Israel, he commanded that at their solemn feasts they should, all the
males, Exo. 23. 1^* 17.
three times in the year appear before the Lord Jehovah, (besides their usual
meetings on the Sabbaths,) which fests were called holy Lev. 23. 1. 4
assemblies or convocations, and had special Number. 28. 2. 18. 25. 26. and 29. 1.
7. 12. 35.
days for calling and assembling the people, wherein Gods word Neh. 8. 1. 2. 8.
was read and expounded unto them; his name magnified* with 2 Chro 7. 6. and
30. 21.
songs and praises; the people answering Neh. 8. 6.
Amen, bowing down and worshipping; sacrifices were offered 2 Chronicles. 35. 8. 12.
13.
for the whole congregation; feasts were celebrated with relief of Neh. 8. 10.
Deuteronomy 16. 14.
the poor; and the people received a 2 Chronicles. 30. 27.
blessing, in the name of the Lord. Which open and solemn service, as it was
pleasing to the Lord, Psalm. 51. 19. Ez^. 20. 40.
who there required the service, offerings, and all the holy things of al his
people: so the neglect and omission hereof, was a forsaking of him and 2 Chronicles.
29. 6. 7. 8.
a procuring of his wrath. Wherefore the godly magistrates, were careful to
establish and mainteyn that public worship, appoynting 2 Chronicles. 31. ^.
the Priests and Levites for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister
and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the Lord; and
the faithful used to frequent that place, and those solemnities, that they
might praise God Psalm 22. 22. and 122. 4. and 35. 18.
in the midds of the congregation, among much people, and there declare with
the voice Psalm. 26. 7. 8.
of thanksgiving, and set forth all his wondrous works; and pay Psalm. 116. 18
19.
their vows unto him, in the presence of all the folk, within the courts of
his house, which he had Psalm. 132. 13. 14.
chosen for his rest for ever, loved there to dwell, and delighted therein. They
used also to Deuteronomy. 33. 19
call the people unto the mountain, there to offer the sacrifices of
righteousness; to stir up, and exhort one another, to bless Psalm. 68. 36.
God in the Assemblies, and Psa 107. 31. 32.
exalt him in the congregation of the people. The like public worship, the
Lamb solemnizeth unto his Father, whiles he stands upon Mount Sion with his
144. thousand; Rev. 14. ^. 2. 3.
where the voice of the heavenly congregation, is heard like the sound of many
waters, and of a great thunder, and like harpers harping with their harps, and
singing a new so^g before the throne. And there Christ's praise Psalm. 22. 25.
is of God, in the great assembly, his vows he performs before them that
fear him, he declares Ps. 40. 9. 10.
Gods justice and mercy, his truth and his salvation. Whose praise therefore is
heard in the Ps. 149. 1. 2.
Congregation of Saints, Israel joying in his maker, and the sons of Sion
rejoicing in their king; saying Rev. 19. 1.
Halelu-jah, salvation and glory and honor and power, unto the Lord our God;
ver. 6.
Halelu-jah for the Lord God almighty reigns.

6. An other cause of the joining together of the Saints; is their
edification, in the knowledge and fear of God. For although they have his word
privately to meditate therein day and night, which also he blesses unto them;
yet in his church or assembly he more plentifully powers out his blessings,
as he promised by Moses, Exo. 20. 24.
In every place where I shall put the remembrance of my name, I will come unto
thee and bless thee. And as his name was in his 2 Chro. 20. 9
house and Temple, so there he appointed ministers to 1 Chr. 16. 4.
rehearse or make mention of the same, to Deuteronomy. 33. 10
teach Iaakob his judgments and Israel his laws. Which Law when he first gav
unto them, he said unto Moses, Deuteronomy. 4. 1^.
Gather me the people together, and I will cause them to hear my words; and
when afterward it was solemnly repeted, every Sabbath year; by like
commaundment the people Deuteronomy 31. 12.
were to be gathered together, men, women, children, and strangers; to hear and
learn the same. Yea every Sabbath day, the people assembled in their Act. 15.
21.
synagogues, throughout all their cities, for the same purpose. And in these
last days, it was foretold, how many people should provoke one another to go
up to the mountayn and house of God, where he would Isa. 2. 2. 3.
teach them his ways, and they would walk in his paths; because the law was
to go forth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Wherefore Christ
often visited the John. 18. 20. Luke 4. 15. 16
Temple and synagogues, (as did also his Act. 3. 1. and ^3. 5. 14. 44.
disciples,) to show how he regarded the assemblies of his people, in which he
uttered so many gracious words, and wrought so many great miracles. And after
that he had gathered a new people to himself, they also usually met together,
Acts. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 1^. 17. 18. etc. and 14 4. 5. 12. 19. 26.
for the food of Gods word, and other holy things, in the churches or
assemblies; where Christ had given gifts unto men, in the persons of his
officers, Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. 12.
for the gathering together of the Saints, and edification of his body. Then
the Isa. 60. 3.
nations walked in the light of Jerusalem, and there the Lord gathered Ier. 23.
3. 4.
his sheep into their folds, where they might grow and increase; and set up 1
Pet. 5. 1. 2
shepherds over the^, which should feed them; he Ezekiel. 34. 14 15. 16.
fed them in good pasture, and they lay in a good fold, he brought them to
their rest, reduced that which was driven away, bound up that which was broken,
and strengthened the weak, by the doctrines of his gospel. There God is very
terrible Psalm. 89. 7.
in the mystery of the Saints, whiles by the fire of his spirit, he causes
on earth and in his heave^ly temple, Rev. ^. 5. and 11. 1^.
lightnings, and Voices, and thundrings, and earthquake, and much hayl. For the
words that his wise men there speak, given by him the One pastor, are like
Eccl. 12. 1^.
go^ds to excite and stir up our dull nature, that being Act. 2. 37.
pricked in our hearts we may be drawn to repentance; like Ier. 5. 14.
a fire to devour ye adversaries; like Ps. 149. 6. 7
a two edged sword to execute vengeance; like a Ier. 23. 29.
^a^mer to break the stone; like 2 Cor. 10. 4. 5.
mighty weapons of war, to cast down bulwarks, and whereby the wise Pro. 21. 22.
goes up into the city of the mighty, and casts down the strength of the
confidence thereof. Again, there are uttered ye words of Act. 5. 20.
life, which Psa 119. 50. Ioh. 5. 25.
qui^ken the hearers, and bring the^ o^ of the graves of syn; the words o^ 3
Cor, 5. 19.
reconciliation, which make peac^ between God and the conscience are as Song.
2. 5.
flagons of wine, and comfortable apples, to refresh the si^ sowl; even the
words of Act. 13. 26.
salvation* and of Ioh. 6. 68.
eternal life. These Christ puts in the mouths of his ministers; and by the
oil of his spirit, causes the seven lamps Exo. 25. 37. Number. 8. 2. 3. Psalm.
119. 105
of the golden candlestick of his law, to give light continually in his
tabernacle. With these waters, he moystneth the garden of his church, and the
several roots and brnches of the same; whereupon such as are planted in the
Lord; house, Psalm. 92. 13. 14.
do flou^ish in his courts, and still bring forth fruit; their leaf fades not,
neither does their fruit fayl, Ezekiel 47. 12
because their waters run out of the sanctuary.

7. A third reason of the Saints gathering together, is that they might the
better resist the common adversaryes. For there is war continual, Genesis 3 15.
between the serpents seed and the church; and they Psalm. 2. 2.
band themselves together, to bese^t Rev. 20. 9.
the ^ents of the Saints and the beloved city. Against that kingdom of
darkness, God gathers and sets a contrary kingdom, a band of Christian
soldjers, or Rev. 19. 14. 19.
heavenly warriors, the 1 Chronicles. 9. 19.
host of the Lord; who standing and fighting together under the banner of his
gospel, by the conduct of his Spirit, and Christ their captain; are an help,
strength and comfort one to another. These come Psalm. 110. 3.
willingly, at the time of assembling Christ's army in holy bewty; among them
ar Heb. 13. 17. ^. Tim. 2. 3. 4
guids and leaders, the overseers of the Churches, as the 2. King. 2. 12. and.
13. 14
charrets and horsemen of Israel; they are al furnished with the Ephesians. 6. 11. 12.
13. etc.
armor of God, having his word for asword, his faith for a shield, his
salvation for a helmet upon their heads. These weapons of their warfare, ar
mighty through God; and here are more shields and targets, Song. 4. 4.
the^ hung on David's towr; the trumpets of the Lord do 2. Cron 13. 12. Number. 10.
10.
sound an alarm against the enemies, and in their conflicts the people of God
do 2. Sam 10. 11. Josh. 1. 14.
help one another as need requires, whereby they are emboldned and comforted
among themselves, ar terrible to their foes as an Song. 6. 9.
army with banners, and having fought together the good fight of faith, do get
the victory over Rev. 12. 7. 11.
the Dragon and his Angels, by the blood of the Lamb, through many*
afflictions, and so at last, do triumph in glory.

8. A fourth cause and benifit of this society, is the mutual aid
strengthening, and consolation one of another in all other Christian duties both
public and private. For as the several members of a man's body ar serviceable
to the whole and each to other; so ar the Saints among themselves, having every
one their Romans 12. 3.
mesure of faith, their diversity of gifts and graces from God, that what is
wanting in one, may be supplied by an other. And as the 1. Cor. 12. 21
eye cannot say to the hand, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you:
so cannot the least member in the church of Christ, be refused as unnecessary,
but may be beneficial to the greatest. For Pro. 27. 17.
as yton sharpneth iron; so does man sharpen the face of his friend. 1. These.
5. 11
And hence do arise the mutual exhorting 1 These. 5. 11. Heb. 3. 13.
and building up one of another in the faith 3. John 8.
laboring together unto the truth; 1. These. 5. 14. and. 4. 18.
admonishing the unruly, comforting the feeble minded, bearing with the weak,
Heb. 10. 24.
considering one another to provoke unto love and good works; Luke. 18. 3. Lev.
19. 17.
rebuking for syn and trespass, confessing of faults Iam. 5. 16.
one to another, and praying one for an other, bearing Gal. 6. 2.
one another burden; rejoicing Romans 12. 15. Job. 30. ^5.
with them that rejoice, and weeping with them that are in trouble; Phil 4. 14.
communicating to the afflictions and distributing Romans 12. 13
to the necessities one of an other; Mat. 25. 36 49. Psalm. 35. 13. 14. 2. Cor.
^. 11.
visiting them in sickness, mourning and laboring together in prayer for the^;
with many other offices of like nature, for the refreshing of soul and body;
al which are found and felt in this holy communion and body, wherein if one 1.
Cor. 12. 26.
member suffer, al suffer with it; and if one be had in honor, al rejoice with
it; so near a conjunctio^ does Gods spirit work in the hearts of the faithful,
which makes them to look, Phil. 2. 4.
not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

9. For these and the like reasons, has the communion and society of the
Church been always praised, sought for, loved and esteemed. For as God though
he Deuteronomy. 33. 3.
love his people, and has al his saints in his hand; yet Psalm. 87. 2.
loves the gates of Sion, above all the habitations of Iakob: so his people
likewise have Psalm. 26. 8.
loved the habitation of his house, and desired this Psalm. 27. 4.
one thing of the Lord, yt they might dwell in the same al days of their life,
to behold the Lords bewty and to inquire in his temple* esteming Psalm. 84. 10.
a day in his courts better the^ a thousand other where; lamenting their lot
when they were exiled therfro^; and Psalm. 42. 4.
pouring out their very heart, when they remembered how they had gone with the
multitude into Gods house, with voice of song, praise, and solemnity; for which
now their Psalm. 84. 2.
sowles longed, and even faynted in the^. Yea the very Lam. 1. 4.
ways of Sion lamented, when no man came to the solemn feasts; and Israel
mourned, when the Lord had destroyed his Lam 2. 6. 7.
congregation, caused the feasts and Sabbathes to be forgotten in Sion, and
forsaken his altar; their heart was heavy, and their eyes dimm, Lam. 5. 17. 18.
because the mountain of Sion was desolate. And so comfortable was the
fellowship of Gods children, unto the Apostles themselves (though they were the
Gal ^. 9. Rev. 21. 14,
pillars and foundations of the church, and needed this help less then
others,) that they often longed to Romans 1. 11. 12. 1. These. 2. 17.
see the brethren, for their comfort, through their mutual faith; and earnestly
entreated the help of their Romans 15. 3^* Ephesians. 6. 19. Hebr. 13. 1^. 19.
prayers, even as they again 1 The. 1^. ^*
prayed for them, had great Phile^ 1. 7. 3 Ioh. 4.
joy and consolation in their love, and holy walking in the truth; yea esteemed
them the 1 These. ^. 19 20.
crown of their rejoicing, their glory and their joy. Even Christ himself in
the heavines of his heart, Mat. 26. 38 40. 43. Luke 22. 46.
sought comfort by the prayers of his disciples; to teach us how to esteem the
fellowship of the faithful.

10. Of al these, and many more blessings, are those deprived, that refuse or
neglect to unite them selves with Christ in his Church; or do with draw and
separate themselves therefrom, to live alone, as in the desert; or to frequent
the company of the wicked. They want the benefit and comfort of Gods graces in
his children, they want the help, strengthening, and encouragement in time of
trouble; and the labor of such foolish ones do^^ weary them, ^eel^s. 10. 15
because they kno^ not to go into the City; they a^ exposed to many perils,
like wa^ dring sheep upon the mountay^ ready to be Ezekiel. 34. 5.

dispersion; For behold how good and how pleasant it is, brethren to dwell even

Psalm. 43. 3. CHAP. XVII.
How the Saints gather into communion, and grow up unto a body or church.

The caling of the Saints into communion, we have seen to consist of two
branches, 1. A separation from the wicked of the world; 2. and a collection or
gathering together of themselves in the faith and love of Christ. Which two
things were also implied in the first caling of our father Abraham, when he was
willed; 1. to get Genesis 12. ^
him out from his country, kindred, and fathers house, (which were Ios. 24. 2.
idolaters:) 2, and to come to the place which God would show him, (where he and
his posterity, Psalm. 105. 44 45, Deuteronomy. 4. 5
might serve and obey the Lord. It remains yet further to be spoken, of the
covenant and communion, that the Saints enter into, and keep among themselves.

2. This congregation of Saints, when it is at the greatest, is but a little
flock and small remnant; being compared with the multitudes of ye world: but the
beginnings hereof, are marvelously weak, small and co^temptible; like the grain
of mustard seed which Mat. 13. 32.
is the least of all seeds; and as Israel, which Deuteronomy. 7. 7.
were the fewest of al peoples. For God taking them one Ier. 3. 14.
of a city and two of a tribe, and these the 1 Cor. 1. 26. 27. 28.
foolish, weak, and vile of the world, the Luke 14. 21.
poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind, whose dwelling is by the ver. 23.
highwayes and hedges, he brings the^ neither Zech. 4. 6.
by an army, nor strength, but by his own spirit, into his house and kingdom,
where though there be but Mat. 18. ^^.
two or three gathered together in his name, he is in the mids of them. These
being once borne of God, begotten by the immortal seed of his word, unto the
faith of the Gospel; know also that there is a Jerusalem from above, Gal. 4. 26.
which is the mother of us al; that of Sion it shall be said, Psalm. 87. 5.
Man and man, (that is many men) are borne in her, and the Lord will count when
he writes the people, ver. 6.
He was borne there; therefore they seek to enter into this estate and happy
communion; they ask the way to Sion with their faces thitherward, saying, Ier
50. 5.
Come and ioyn to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

3. This covenant which they make together, stands upon two pillars; 1. to
keep their faith in God by Jesus Christ, 2. and to observe his laws in love.
In both these are they to build up and help forward one another, saying, Mic.
4. 5.
al peoples will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the
name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever. Hereupon follow their assembling
Heb. 10, 25.
or gathering together for the instruction one of an other; their mutual ex
hortations to Act. 14. 22. Colos. 1. 23.
continue in the faith grounded and stablished, and to 1 Cor. 16. 13.
stand fast therein; their prayers one with and for another, that Ephesians. 3. 14. 17.
Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith; their rebuking such as teach
unwholesome doctrine, that so they may be Tit. 1. 13
hayl or sound in the faith; of which if any make shipwreck, they are to be
thrust out of the communion of the Saints, and 1 Timothy 1. 19 20. Tit. 3. 10.
delivered unto Satan. And for their conversation, they Deuteronomy. 27. 17
set up the Lord in that day to be their God, and to walk in his ways, and to
keep his ordinances, and his commandments and his laws, and to hearken unto
his voice: and they promise to Isa. 2. 3.
walk in ye paths of God as he shall teach them; from whence arise (both
publicly and privately) their mutual love and care each of other, Heb. 10. 24.
provoking unto love and good works, and walking Ephesians. 4. 1.
worthy of their caling whereunto they are caled: their 1 These 5. 14 Lev. 19.
17. 1 Timothy 5. 20.
admonitions and reproofs one of another when they syn, seeking to Gal. 6. 1.
restore them with the spirit of meeknes; but withdrawing 1 These. 3. 5.
from the disobedient, and putting away such as are wicked 1 Cor. 5. 13.
from among them.

4. Unto this covenant, ar all that make profession of faith and obedience, to
be admitted, without respect of persons; for in Christ Jesus there is Gal. 3. 28.
no difference of Jew or Gentile, of rich or poor, of bond or free, of male or
female, for all are one, and alike redeemed by his blood, whereby he has
confirmed the covenant Mat. 26. 28. Dan. 9. 27.
for the many; and he has powered out his spirit upon al flesh, Joel. 2. 28.
(...).
upon sons and daughters, upon old and young, upon servants and mayds. And
together with themselves, their infants also ar recived, by virtue of Gods,
promise unto Genesis 17. 7.
Abraham, which promise by Christ is Luke 1. 54. 55. 72. 73. 74. Act. 2. 39 2
Cor. 1. 20.
confirmed unto us, with all the benefits and privileges of the same. Which
infants, though they want discretion to perceiv the favor of God for the
present; yet want they not sanctification, but 1 Cor. 7. 14
ar holy, if but one parent beleev in Christ, and this through the mighty work
of Gods spirit, who sanctifies Ier. 1. 5.
his from the womb; and by this grace, does comfort the parents, in that he is
both God of them and of their seed; and after, the children also have their
faith confirmed, by knowing that Psalm. (...). 10.
they were cast upon him from the womb; and he was their God, from their mothers
belly.

5. And as the number of believers grows, so ought they to gather together
and we accept into our fellowship, all that Act. 2. 41.
gladly receiv the word; even such as be Romans 14. 1.
weak in faith must we receiv, Romans 15. 1. 3
bearing their infirmities after Christ's example, who would not Mat. 12* 20.
break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking weke, but nourish it rather by
the oil and breath of his spirit, that it might burn bright. And if notorious
infamous sinners, repent and beleev the Gospel; they may not be repelled, for
Christ came to Luke 5. 32. and 15. 1. etc. 1 Timothy 1. 15.
call, and save such; neither are they to be refused* as impure, who^ he has 1
Cor. 6. 10. 11.
washed and cleansed by his blood, and received to the glory of his father.
Which grace of his David did fore shadow, unto whom there gathered 1 Samuel 22. ^.
al men that were in trouble, and all men that were in debt, and all those that
were vexed in mind, and he was their Prince. Also when God converteth the
child and not the father, the servant and not the master, the wife and not the
husband, the subject and not the magistrate; such as he caleth must come to his
church; we also must admit, knowing that Christ has said, he cameto Mat. 10.
34. 35.
set variance betwixt parents and children, so that a man's enemies should be
they of his own howshold. Yet is not their entrance into the faith and church
of God, any discharge of them from their duty and obedience toward their
former governors; but let every man (as says the Apostle) 1 Cor* 7. 20. 21.
abide in the same vocation wherein he was caled. The believing wife, may ver
13.
not forsake her unbelieving husband; nor the servant 1 Timothy 6. 1. 2.
his master; and every sowl must* Romans 13. 1.
be subject to the higher powers, even to 1 Pet. 2. 13.
every humane creature for the Lords sake. As Christ's kingdom is Ioh. 18. 36.
not of this world, so neither does it destroy or abolish the policies of the
same, but mainteyn them rather, whiles it teaches all men to do their duty,
and subject themselves, even for Romans 13. 5. Eccles 10. 20.
conscience sake.

6. Again as no earthly power can compel a man unto this estate of grace, (for
no man comes unto Christ, Ioh. 6. 44.
except the Father draw him; faith is the Ephesians. 2. 8.
gift of God not of men, and he Act. ^. 47.
adds to his church such as he will save:) so neither can any creature hinder
this good work; but when Christ draws us, we Song. 1. 3.
will run after him; and when he effectually caleth us, we Mat. 4. 20. 22.
will leav father and friends and all to follow him. And as our gathering
together is in Mat. 18. 20.
his name, so must we defend it by his authority, answering as did the
Apostles to the^ that blame us, Act. 5. 29.
we ought rather to obey God then men.

7. But forasmuch as the Saints are dispersed over all the face of the earth,
in several cities and countries; God requires not yt they should al go to one
place; for that could not stand with civil policy, neither were possible for
them to perform. Therefore, albeit whiles the seat of his church was in the
little land of Iewrie, he commanded all the men to appear together before him at
Jerusalem, Deuteronomy. 16. 16.
thrice every year: yet when al nations were admitted into his covenant,
adopted to be Abraham's seed, and the Israel of God; he gathered them together
by his Apostles, in several cities where they dwelt, and so established many
congregations in one country, as the seven churches in the lesser Rev. 1. 4. 20
Asia, the churches of 1 Cor. 16. ^.
Galatia, of Act. 15. 41.
Syria and Cilicia, and sundry other mentioned in scripture, do witness; even
in Judea were more churches planted as the Apostle Gal. 1. 21.
Paul notes.

8. And God which caled the people unto his faith; furnished them also with
diverse gifts of his spirit, 1 Cor. 12. 8. 9. 10. etc.
wisdom, and knowledge, and prophecy, and tongues, and many other graces
wherewith he adorned the spowse and bride of his beloved son; that by them they
might serve him, and help, comfort, and edify one an other in their most holy
faith. He appointed also that some which for their gifts and conversation were
found fit, should have the care and oversight of that congregation where they
were set, Heb. 13. 17.
to watch for their sowles, and to feed and rule them with the word of God.
These for their gravitie ar caled 1 Timothy 5. 17
Elders; for the charge committed to them, Phil. 1^ Act 20. 28.
Bishops or Overseers; for the message whereon they are sent, the Rev. 1. 20.
Angels of the churches; and for the effect of their administration, they are
named Hobad. verse. (...).
Saviors, by the doctrine of the Gospel, 1 Timothy 4. 16
saving those that hear them. Yet are not these 1 Pet. 5. 3.
Lords over Gods heritage, but the administers of his graces and blessings
among them, and ensamples to the flock; not 2 Cor. 1. 24.
having dominion over their faith, but helpers of their joy.

9 By the 1 Pet. 1. 23.
seed of the Word in the mouths of these Ephesians 4. 11. 1^
ministers and the other 1 Cor. 14. 3. 5. 24. 31.
members of of the church, ar children begotten and multiplied daily, that
Jerusalem enlarges Isa. 54. 2. 3
the place of her tents, and they spread out the curtains of her habitatio^s.
For she increases on the right hand and on the left, until this host of our
David become great, 1 Chronicles. 12. 22.
like the host of God; and his Ier. 33. 22.
seed, as the army of heaven that cannot be numbered. By the same word, as by 1
Pet. 2. 20 Isa. 55. 10
milk and wine, ar the people nourished up unto life eternal; and their
covenant with God and one with another, ar the two staves, Zach. 11. 7
Be wtie and Bands, which Christ the good shepherd has taken to feed and
rule his flock. His covenant with them, Zach. 11. 10
is Beauty or Pleasance, for by Psalm. 25. 14.
it he gives the^ knowledge, which Prove. 2. 10. and 22. 17. 18.
is pleasant to their sowl, as is also Song. 1. 16.
himself and his Prove 3. 17.
ways. By this covenant he confirms his Isa. 59. 21.
spirit upon the^ and his words in the mouth of the^ and their seed, which words
are Prove. 16. 24 Psalm. 19. 7. 10.
pleasant and as the honey co^b, sweetness to y^ sowl, and health to the bones;
which causes the^ to desire that they may dwell Psalm. 27. 4.

conserveth the Zech. 11. 14.
brotherhood of his people, whereby they are lincked together in love, laboring

to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, being clothed with the

al these things, having ver. 1^.
Love, which is the bond of perfectnes.

10. Sometimes God brings unto his faith and church, the governors and great
men of the earth; whose authority and scepters are a great help to the
conservation of true religion, and outward peace of his people, by their
defense of the just, and punishment of evildoers. These notwithstanding their
high places, yet are to have no Psa. 131. 1. ^
haughty hearts nor lofty eyes, but behave themselves, and compose their sowles,
like weyned children; learning daily from D^^. 17. 18. 19.
the ministry and book of God, to fear the Lord and to keep all the words of
his law, that their Deuteronomy. 17. 20
hearts be not lifted up above their brethren; They are with them to Eze. 46. 10.
begin and end the public worship of God; they may not take of the ver. 18.
peoples inheritance, nor thrust them out of their possession; they are to
conteyn as well themselves as their subjects in the obedience of Christ, to be
foster fathers Isa. 49. 23.
and nourses of the church; unto which they have brought their Rev. 21. 24.
glory and their honor; expecting a better and an eternal glory with all
Saints in the kingdom of God. For there is a covenant between them and their
subjects 2 Chronicles. 23. 16.
that they will be the Lords people, yea themselves are the foremost 2 Chronicles.
29. 10. and so forward in the chap.
to make it, and to order al things in their kingdoms according to Gods word.
As that good king Josiah 2 Chronicles. 34. 29 -- 32.
in the assembly of al his people, both great and small, first covenanted
himself to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and with all his sowl, that he
would accomplish the words of the covenant written in Gods book: and then
caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benajamin, to stand to the same.

11. But because in times of worldly peace, many will press to enter into the
church, for company, favor, or fashion sake; which otherwise would never
regard the same, being profane, idolatrous or irreligious, the children of this
world: therefore care must be had that no such unclean wicked persons be
accepted. For though the gates be open, Isa. 26. 2.
that the righteous nation which keeps the faith, may enter in: yet seeing it
is said, that the way shall be caled Isa. 35. 8.
holy, and the polluted shall not pass by it; that Jerusalem shall be holy, Joel
3. 17.
and no strangers shall go through her, nor a Zach. 14. ^1.

them, the seed and foundation of religion, before they be received, namely Heb.

groundwork of his kingdom, saying Mark. 1. 15.
Repent, and beleev the Gospel. Until therefore, such willingly Act. 2. 41. Romans
10. ^.
receiv and confess the truth, renouncing their former evil ways; promising
submissio^, meeknes, and obedience in the faith of the Gospel: until the wolf
have, learned Isa. 11. 6. 7. 8.
to dwell in peace with the lamb, the leopard to lie with the kidd, the bear to
feed with the kow, and the Lion to eat straw like the bullock: we may not
admit them into communion with us, (for 2. Cor ^. ^^
what part has the believer with the unbeliever?) but refuse their proffered
and pretended service, as the fathers of Israel answered the like intruders,
Ez^. ^. ^. ^.
It is not for you and for us (jointly,) to build an house unto our God, but we
our selves together will build it, unto the Lord God of Israel. And as there
were 1 Chro^. ^. ^4.
porters in the fowr winds or quarters of Gods ancient house; eve^ porters set,
that 2 Chronicles. 23. 19.
none that was unclean in any thing, should enter in; and diligent watch and
Nohem. 7. 3
ward was kept at the gates of Jerusalem, for fear of enemies: so in this new
and Christian Jerusalem, though the gates thereof be Ro^el. 21. 2^
never shutt, yet is there such watch to be kept, that no Rev. 21. 27.
no unclean thing may enter into it, neither whatsoever works abominatio^ or
lies, but they which a^ written in the Lambs book of life.

12. The Saints being thus gathered, as a people Number. 23. 9.
that shall dwe^ by themselves, and not be reckne^ among the nations, (for that
the ar Job. 15. 19.
chosen out of the world, and Lev. 30. 24.
separated from the same;) and being builded as a city Psalm. 122. 3.
compact together in it self, and growing up in Christ the chief corner stone
unto an holy Temple in the Lord: are made the Ephesians. 2. 21. 22.
habitation of God by the spirit, and do dwell Dout. 33. 28
alone in safety, in a land of wheat and wine, also their heavens do drop the
deaw. For the graces of God, by his word and spirit, are as a Psalm. 46. 4. Rev.
22. 1.
river of water of life clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the lamb, whose streams make glad this city of God, and moisten the
trees planted in this gardein. Yea God himself Rev. 21. 3. Psalm. 46. 5.
dwells here, and is in the mids of it, therefore it shall not be moved. As

making the bars of the gates strong, and in it self he sets peace, and
this not in one, but in 1 Cor. 14. 33
all the churches of the Saints, amids Rev. 2. 1. 2. etc.

churches though they be many in number, yet are they one in unity. To them al,

of them a like power and grace. And as he guided his ancient Israel the twelv
tribes, by day in the pillar of a clowd, (...). 1^. 21.
and by night in a pillar of fire, to giv them light, that they might go both
by day and night: so has he created (according to his promise,) (...). 4. 5. 6.
upon every place of mount Sion, the church under the Gospel,) and upon the
assemblies thereof, a clowd and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire
by night, that al Christian churches, have from him their direction and
protection; whiles in the ministry of his word and spirit, he speaks unto
the^ as in Psalm. 99 7.
ye clowdy pillar; and is their Isa. 25. 4.
shelter against the tempest, their shadow against the heat. For which grace,
Psalm. 68. 26
praise ye God in the Assemblies; even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of
Israel.

13. Thus every Church is like mount Sion, Psalm. 48. 2. 3
fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth, the city of the great king, in
ye palaces whereof God is known for a refuge, which he will Psalm. 48. ^.

nations and people which are saved, walk in the Isa. 60. 30. Rev. 21. 24.

Ier. 31. 23. CHAP. XVIII.
Of the communion that the Saints in all Churches have in things spiritual.

NOW as the faithful are thus co^pact, like living and precious stones, in one
holy Temple, and members of one body; so havethey fellowship together in all
Christian offices spiritual and humane, and each with other do willingly
communicate the manifold graces of God. Their spiritual communion may be
considered in three things: First in all duties from themselves toward God; as
be praises, tha^ksgivings, prayers supplications etc. which they power out one
with and for an other. Secondly in all graces given them of God, as are the
words of his covenant, the co^forts and seals of the same, opened and applied
for the helping forward and assurance of their salvation. Thirdly in all duties
among themselves, one toward an other, as counsels, deliberations,
exhortations, consolations, admonitions, rebukes, censures, and such like: al
which for the honor of God and their mutual good, they carefully together do
keep and execute.

2. Their communion in the Worship of God, is when at time and place appointed,
they al come together, Psalm. 1^2. 21 (...).
to serve, confess, and praise the Lord, and call upon his name. For which as
Israel of old had their assemblies, where the 1 Chronicles. 16. 7. 8. and ^
ministers of God publicly and solemnly uttered his praises, discoursing of al
his wonderful works, and giving unto him the glory of his name; made also verse.
35.
their requests unto God for their wants, unto al which, all the people ver. 36.
said Amen, and praised the Lord: so also in the Apostles days, Gods people
had still their Act. 16. 1^. 16.
places of prayer, for which holy exercise, the Christians Act. 1^. 1^.
assembled, and in which they continued Act. 1. 14*
with one accord, both men and women. Where the Act. 6. 4.
ministers of Christ, gav themselves unto this business, that minding the
public state of the church, they might for and with the same, make requests
and giv thanks, in ye ears and understanding of ye people which thereunto 1 Cor.
14. 1^ 16.
answered Amen. These now are not ye prayers or praises-of him alone yt
speaks, but of ye whole asse^blie, which atte^d with their ears, asse^t with
their hearts, and seal with their lips, that part of public administration;
co^firming it also by signs Nehem. ^. 6. Act. 20. 36. and 21. 5. Rev 4. 9. 10.
11.
and gestures, beseeming such an action. In these, (whither ordinary, or
extraordinary with 1 Samuel 7. 5. 6. Ezr. 8. 21 Joel. 1. 14. Act 13. 2. 3.
fasting and humiliatio^ of sowl, upon special occasions,) there is a Act. 2.
42. Rev. 5. 8. 9. Psalm. 98. 5. 6.
communion and harmony among the Saints, that with one mind Rev. 15. 6.
and one mouth do praise God, and their prayer 2 Chronicles. 30. ^5. 27.
comes up unto heaven to his holy habitatio^ And as the public assemblies of
the whole church; so the more private meetings in families, or of other friends
for special causes, is both comfortable to themselves, and acceptable to the
Lord: for he had promised that where there is a Mat. 18. 19.
sy^phonie or agreement, but of two o^ his together in earth, to desire
anything, it shall be given them; so much he respects the fellowship and
vn^nimitie of his people, and the^ verse. 20.
gathering together in his name*

3. But when through distance of place, or other just occasion, they cannot or
do not come together* as also in their private prayers, which they power out
before the Lord, either some few together, o^ each one apart; the faithful have
yet spiritual communion and benefit by praying one for an other; while they 2 Timothy 1. 3.
remember and 1 These. 1. 2.
make mention of their brethren unto God, rejoicing Phil. 1. 3. 4.
and giving thanks for his blessings upon the^, Romans 1. 9. 10
desiring things that may benefit and comfort them, praying for deliverance
from Phile^. 22.
ba^ds or other afflictions, for strength and Col. 4. 12.
stabilitie in the truth, for 1 John. 5. 16.
remission of syns, or for other graces as the necessities of the Saints do
require, for all who^ we are Ephesians. 6. 18. 19.
exhorted to pray, with all manner prayer and supplication in the spirit, and
for Act. 12. 5.
special persons, to make more earnest suit, to Romans 15. 30. (...).
strive or wrestle together with them, by prayers to God for them. This
fellowship is comfortable, to all that know the use of prayer; and how much it
prevails with God if it be ferve^t. Wherefore the Apostles did not only
perform this duty for others in their absence, but themselves so Heb. 13. 18.
19. 2 Cor. 1. 10. 11. Philem 22.
earnestly desired it at the hands of al, and trusted for help by it. Also the
Saints that were before the^ knew well, and nourished this communion, whiles
they Dan. 2. 17. 18.
requested their brethren to pray unto God for the^ especially the 1. Sa^. 7.
8. and 1^. 19.
prophets, whose petitions were exceeding beneficial, not only to the Exodus
32. 11 24. Deuteronomy. 9. ^0. Am* 7. 2. 3. 6.
church and mem*bers thereof, whom they sometime saved from death by this means;
but also for Gone. 20. 17
strangers; so effectual with the Lord is the prayer of the Saints, and the
odor thereof, as sweet Psalm. 141. ^ Rev. 5. 8.
incense before him: and a token it was of his heavy indignation, when he Ior.
7. 16. and ^4. 11.
for bad his prophets to pray for the people.

4. Concerning the word of God and our fellowship in the same, we have Chapt. ^.
before see^ how God bestowed it specially upon his own people, as a testimony
of his grace toward them, though also in a general favor he communicates it
with Mark. 1^. 15
the whole world. Now the saints whose peculiar right and Deuteronomy. 33. 4.
inheritance it is, must be careful to use it as a common blessing, every one
in himself, and al of them with and for one an other both privately and
publicly. Privately to read and speak of ye same, unto their families and
neighbors, co^tinually-rehersing or Deuteronomy. 6. 7 (...)
whe^ting ye words of God, upon and unto their children, talking of them when
they are in the house, and as they walk by the way, when they lie down, and
when they rise up; that so me^ may learn and know the scriptures from their
childhood, ^ Tim. 3. ^5
and by them be made wise unto salvation, through the faith which is in Christ
Jesus. And that al Christians, may by this means be able, to exhort 1 Thessalonians. 5.
^^
and edify one an other, in the knowledge and faith of God; may have their
speech Colos. 4. ^.
gracious always, and powdered with sal^; may discern truth from error, whiles
by serching the scripture, as did the men of Berea, Act. 17. 11.
they see whither the things taught them be so. And this was foretold to be a
special part of Gods covenant with his people, that Isa. 59. 21.
his words which he has put in their mouth, shall no^ depart out of their
mouth, nor on of the mouth of their seed, nor out of the mouth of their seeds
seed, from henceforth even for ever.

5. But in the Assemblies of the Saints, the light of this grace shines more
clearly; for in the^ have the scriptures bee^ read and preached of old Act. 15.
21.
every sabbath day; there all men have not only liberty, but ar exhorted to
desire that they may 1 Cor. 14. 1. 39.
prophecy; that is, verse. 3. 4.
speak unto the church, to edifying, to exhortation, and to comfort: which is
therefore to be coveted verse. 1. 5.
rather then other spiritual gifts, because it te^deth both to the building up
of the brethren, and conversion of the unbelievers, 1 Cor. 14. 23 24. 25.
and glory of God thereby. Al therefore that have received this gift, may in ver.
40.
seemlines and order use and manifest it, for the profit of the whole and every
member; being careful that it be done according to Romans 12. 6.
the proportion of faith, and when any speak, that it be 1 Pet. 4. 10. 11.
as the words of God. And although a woman, in regard of her sex, may 1 Cor.
14. 34 35.
not speak or teach in the church: yet with other women, and in her private
family, she Prove. 31. 26
opens her mouth in wisdom, and the doctrine of grace is in her tongue. So
Marie Exodus 15. 20
the prophetess, was guide to the women of Israel, in their songs of
tha^ksgiving: so Act. 18. 25. 26.
Priscilla at home, helped to expound the way of God more perfectly to learned
Apollos; and was (together with Phil. 4. 3.
other women) acknowledged of the Apostle Paul, to be one of his Romans 16. 3.
fellowhelpers in Christ Jesus. And the Lord both in those days, and before,
had furnished sundry holy women with the gift of Luke 2. 36. Act. 21. 9. Ex 15.
20. Iud. 4. 4. 2 King 22 14.
prophecy, as he promised also by Joel. 2. 28. 29.
his servant Joel: to teach, that his graces are given unto all as he sees
good to bestow them; though there is a difference between the extraordinary
gift of prophecy, give^ but unto few, and the ordinary prophecy or
exposisio^ of scripture, which is common with many.

6. Above al other, the Officers given of Christ, for the work of the
ministry, the Act. 20. 28.
Overseers of the churches, are to study and 1 Timothy 5. 17.
labor in the word and doctrine, to 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2.
feed the flocks that depend upon them, to 1 Samuel 1^. 23
show them the good and right way, to Ephos. 4. 11. 12.
build up the body of Christ, to 2 Timothy 2. 15.
divide the word aright, to speak it Ier 23. 28.
faithfully, to keep Act. 20. 27.
nothing back, either through negligence fear or flattery, but to show them
the whole counsel of God, and teach the^ Levit. 10. 11
all the statutes which the Lord has commanded, not Ier. 26. 2.
keeping back a word. These Heb. 13. 17.
watch for their peoples sowles, as they that shall giv accounts; and necessity
is laid upon them, therefore woe Ezekiel. 34. ^.
unto the^, if they preach not the Gospel. 1 Cor. 9. 16.
These must have care both of strong and weak, Ioh. ^1. 15. 16. 1 Cor. 3. 1. 2
Heb. 5. 1^. 13. 14.
of sheep and lambs; to feed with strong meat or with milk, as their flock has
need, and is Mark. 4. 33.
capable. Upon these the charge lies, to Exodus 27. 2^ 21.
dress the lamps of Gods law, from evening to morning, that they may always
burn in the Tabernacle of the congregation; to giv to the how should, their
Luke 12. 4^.
portion of meat in season; and to communicate this heavenly Manna with all the
Israel of God, that there may be an equality, as it is written, Exodus 16. ^8
he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack.

7. And together with the words of Gods eternal covenant, Mas. 28. 19 1 Cor.
11. 23. 24.
these also dispense the s^als of the same; by which the communion of the
Saints is more illustrated and confirmed. For by baptism which is Ephesians. 4. 5.
one, we al are made Gal 3. 27. 28.
one in Christ Jesus. And as our fathers were (...) 1 Cor. 10. 2.
baptized unto Moses, in the clowd and in ye sea; so now under Christ* by one
Spirit, we al are baptized into 1 Cor. 12. 13.
one body, whither we be Jews or Greeks, bond or free. Neither can any man
forbid water Act. 10. 47. and 8. 36. 37. 12.
from those which have received the holy Ghost and faith; it is the Mat. 28. 19.
Mark. 16. 16.
common symbol and pledge of our salvation, and (like Col. 2. 11. 12
circumcision,) the Romans 4. 11.
seal of our righteousness by faith, even the seal of Gods covenant to us and
Genesis 17 10. 12. 13. 14 Gal 3. 14. Act. 2. 38. 39.
to our seed. The Supper also of our Lord, is to be distributed to all the
Saints that can 1 Cor. 11. 28 29.
examine themselves, and discern his body therein by faith; and is an other
seal, as of our union with Christ, whose flesh we eat, and drink his blood; so
of our uniting together in his faith. For we (says 1 Cor. 10. 17.
the Apostle) that are many, are one bread and one body, because we al are
partakers of one bread. Therefore must 1 Cor. 11. 20
we come together for this communion, and tarry verse. 33.
one for another, that as brethren we may eat and drink and rejoice together
before the Lord; which he that refuses, or neglects; is worthy to be Number. 9.
13.
rooted out from amongst his people.

8. As the Saints have al a right and interest in the covenant of God, and
seals of the same, wherein they have and hold communion together: so have and
do they also, in all other Christian spiritual duties, public or private. For
all the actions of the Church, being but a practice and performance of Gods
Law; as the members have their portion in the general, so have they also in the
particulars: each one according to his place, caling, and measure of grace,
given him from Christ the head. In the primitive church established by Moses,
when public actions were to be performed, the whole congregation was assembled*
as about the Exodus ^5. 1. 4 etc.
making of the Tabernacle, and all the furniture for the service of God; at the
ordination and authorizing of the Lev. 8. 3. 4. etc.
Priests and Number. 8. 9. 10. 20.
Levites; at the first Deuteronomy. 5. 2. 3. 22.
making and Exodus 24. 3. 4. etc.
solemnizing of the covenant, at the Deuteronomy. 29. 1^ 11. 12.
renewing of the same; and at the Deuteronomy. 1. 1. etc.
repetitio^ of all the Laws and ordinances of the Lord. Unto al and every of
the Israelites, was co^m^nded the care and observation of all Gods statutes;
that neither all nor any of them, Deuteronomy. 29. 18
man nor woman, nor family, nor tribe, should forsake the Lord, nor suffer
among the^ any root to bring forth gall and wormwood; but plainly Lev. 19. 17.
rebuke their neighbor when he sinned in private, or testify against him Lev.
5. 1.
in public if they could, and there were need; to Deu. 13. 8. Lev. 20. 2. 4.
bewray and execute judgment upon open and notorious malefactors; even the
leprous and unclean, though the trial of them apperteyned to the Lev. (...).
Priests, yet all the Number. 5. ^. ^
children of Israel were to look that such were removed out of the host; yea
the care of the Priests purity in their administration, apperteyned Lev. 21. ^.
^. 24.
to all the people. And long after, both in 2 Chro. (...)* ^ 21. 23.
counsels, and in the redressing of public evils and trespasses, all Israel
indifferently, had their hand and presence; as the scripture shows. Ezra. 10.
1. 9. 12. etc.

9. The churches in the Apostles days had also the like right and liberty*
for the multitudes of believers. were both beholders and acto^ in the common
affairs; as at the Act. 1. 15 -- 23. and 6. 2. 3. 5. and 14 23.
choice and ordinatio^ of church officers; at the Act. 15. 2. 4. 6. 7. 12 22.
23. and 21. 22 1. Cor. 6. 2. etc.
deciding of questions and controversies; at the Mat 18. 17 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. 13.
excommunication or casting out of impeniten^ sinners; at the 2 Cor. 8. 19. 1
Cor. 16. 3.
choice and appointment of men, to carry the grace or benevolence of the
Saints, ^ their needy brethren; at the receving and reading of the Apostles
Romans 1. 7.
Letters; and generally, in the public These. 5. 27 ^ Act. 2. 41. 42. etc.
communion and fellowship of the Apostles, and one of another. They were also
willed to exhort, ^ admonish 1 These. 5. 14 2 These. 3. 14. 15.
each other; even the Colos. 4. 17.
Officers of the churches; to Romans 16. 17 1 Heb. 12. 15.
man diligently, and avoid, the causer^ of division and offenses; and to loo^
that no root of bitterness sprung (...) and troubled the^, least thereby many
should be defiled.

10. These and the like privileges in the faith and practice of the Gospel ar
permitted to al Saints in all churches; which they must use in all Rom, 12. 3.
16. 1 Cor. 14. 33. 40.
sobriety, order, and peace: not presuming above their calling, place, or
mesure of understanding; nor abusing their liberty to the trouble or annoyance
of their brethren. And therefore 1 Timothy 5. 17.
Elders or 1 Cor. 12. 28 Act. 20. 17. 28.
Governors ar set to rule the people, and together with the other Officers to
weild the churches affairs. By which means confusion is avoided, and order
observed in the Assemblies; as was in the primitive churches, where the
Overseers and public Ministers, Act. 1. 15. and 15. 6. 7. 13.
propounded, discussed, and carried matters in seemlines and peace. These guides
ar to Heb. 13. 7. 17.
be heard, reverenced, and submitted unto in the Lord; they attend to the
public service of the church, and are as the hand, mouth, and eyes of the
same; by such God of old Exodus 1^. ^ 7. 8.
signified his will to the people; and (...)

for the obteyning of that promised Genesis 3. 15. and 15. 3. 4. 5. Act. 3. 25.
seed that should bruise the Serpe^ts head, and bring blessing upon all
families of the earth. And until that seed, (which was Christ,) came; our
Fathers generally embraced that kind of life, and Deuteronomy. 25. 5. 6. etc. Genesis 30,
1. 1 Samuel 1. 6. Luke 1. 13, 25.
thought it a dishonor to die childlesse: a^^ since that time, it has still
been kept in, and sanctified unto the church, to such as saw good, or had need
so to live; 1 Cor* 7. 2. etc. 9, 5, 1 Timothy 5* 14,
both for the avoiding of syn, and for other help and comfort which that estate
affords. But they which have from God, 1 Cor, 7. 7.
the gift to conteyn their vessels in holiness and honor without marriage, and
which addicting Mat, 19, 12, 1 Timothy 5. 5, (...), Luke 2, 37
themselves to the service of Christ, find it best for avoiding the burdens and
1 Cor, 7. 32, 33, 34,
cares of this life, to keep themselves single, in virginity or widowhood; are
counseled by Mat* 19, 12, 1 Cor, 7. 37, 38. 4^.
Christ and his Apostle so to rest. Yet if any mary they verse. 28. 36.
syn not; only they must so ^ive as verse. 29. 31.
if they were not married, and so use al other worldly things, as if they used
them not, because the fashion of this world passes away. And in their marying,
they must have care not to match themselves in an unequal yoke with
unbelievers, (for that Genesis 6. 2. 3. etc and 27. 46 Deuteronomy. 7. 3. Ezr. 9. 1. 2.
Mal. 2. 11. 12.
has always been reproved,) but only 1 Cor 7. 39.
in the Lord: though if they be married to unbelievers before they are caled to
the faith, they must not then 1 Cor. 7. 10. 12. 13. 16
depart, or put away.

3. The faithful man and woman thus fastened in wedlock, are 1 Pet 3. 7.
heirs together of the grace of life; and so ought to live in peace and love,
the wife Ephesians. 5. 22. 1 Pe. 3. 1.
being subject to her husband (whose 1 Cor. 11. 7
glory she is) as unto the Lord. Their fellowship as it is in 1 Pet. 3. 7.
spiritual duties, so also in humane; such as be Genesis 2. 24. Mat. 19. 6. 1 Cor.

life, which to forbid any Christian, (...) a doctrine 1 Timothy 4. 1, 3
of Divils; and which a shadow Ephesians. 5. 23. ^5.
of that mystical and hevenly communion between Christ and his church, whiles
the man loves and cherishes his wife as verse. 28. 29.
his own body, the woman again loves, verse. 33.
fears, and obeys her husband. This society endures Romans 7. 2.
until death and can not be dissolved except Mat. 5. 32.
for adultery, for which trespass if the magistrate inflict not death,
according Levit. 20. 10
to Gods law; ye injuried person may Number. 5. 31. Mat. 19. 7. 8. 9.
lawfully divorce and put away the offender.

4. The next in the family, a^ children; which as they are the Psa. 1^7. 3.
inheritance and wages of the Lord, so must they be Ephesians. 6. 4. Psalm 78. 3. 4.
6. 7.

23. 13 14.
and correct, but without provoking them to wrath, least Colos. 3. 21.
they be discouraged. For them are parents also to 2 Cor. 12. 14 Genesis 25. 5. 6.
store up, and provide for their maintenance, Ge^ 24. 3 etc Exodus 22. 17. Deuteronomy
7. 3.

Ephesians. 6. 1. 2
honoring and obeying their fathers and mothers in the Lord; and 1 Timothy 5. 4.
Prove. 23. 22.
recompensing them, (if they can and there be need,) in their old age and
poverty. And they that shall Exodus 2^. 15. 17 Mat. 15. 4 Prove. 2^. 20.
smite, curse, or blaspheme their parents, o Deuteronomy. 21. 18 20. 21.
stubbornly refuse to obey them; are for such unnaturalness, to die the death.

5 Servants ar the last in the family, inferior unto children both Io^. 8. 35.
Heb. 3. 5. 5.
in dura^ce and fidelity; yet as their fellowship may be in the faith, for
which their masters should regard them Phile^. 1. 16.
above servants, even brethren beloved: so in civil society they are
notwithstanding to be in Tit. 2. 9. 10.
subjection to their masters, faithful and pleasing them in all things. Of
these, there be two sorts, 1. Free or hired servants; 2. and Bo^dmen or Sclaves.
Of the first sort were the poor Israelites, which Lev. 25. 39.
sold or hired out themselves for necessity to their brethren, or were
chaff^ed by their 2 King. 4. 1.
creditors. These were to be well entreated like brethren, Lev. 25. 43.
not overruled with cruelty; they were to be dismissed Exodus 21. 2.
in the seventh, or at furthest in the fiftith year Lev 25. 40. 41. 54.
called the Iubilee. And when they went out, they were to be Deuteronomy. 15. 13 14.
liberally rewarded with their masters goods. Of the latter sort were the
hethens, either Lev. 25. 44. 45.
bought with price, or conquered by battle; which remained servants always,
themselves and their seed after the^. Servitude, especially bondage, is a
judgment of God upon the world for syn; inflicted upon Chams Genesis 9. 25. 26.
posterity as a curse; yet is the curse by Christ taken away, in whom the bond
and the Gal. 3 28.
free ar one. And this was the case of many strangers in Israel, as of the
Gibeonites the offspring of Canaa^, upon whom their fathers Ios. 9. 23.
curse for outward slaverie was inflicted, which they cheerfully ver. 25. 27.
underwent, and had Gods favor and blessing upon their sowles; they serving
him, and he continewing the^, (though Saul sought to root them out,) and 2 Samuel
21. 1. 2. 3. etc.
punishing all Israel for their injury. The like was also to be seen in others
of that progeny, whom Solomon subdued under 1 King. 9. 31
servile tribute, and whose children remained among the Israelits after the
captivity of Babylon, (as did also the Nethinims of Gibeon,) and were named
Nehem. 11. 3 and 7. ^0.
the sons of Solomon's servants. When such bondmen ar brought to the faith of
the Gospel, their civil servitude is not thereby at an end, no not though they
have 1 Timothy 6. 2.
believing masters; but they are still to giv honor, and do service, even
Colos. 3. (...). 2^.
heartily as to the Lord and not to men; (...) they serve verse. 24.
the Lord Christ in that estate, and ar his 1 Cor. 7. 22.
freemen; therefore they should not verse 21.
care for this yoke, yet if they may be free, they should use it rather. The
masters, ar Clos. 4. 1.
to do unto their servants that which is just and equal, knowing that they also
have a master in heaven: they may Genesis 16. 6*
chasten the^ but not oppress them, nor contemn their judgment Job, 31. 13.
when they contend with the^. Thus servants notwithstanding their freedom in
the faith, ar to be in subjection, and Genesis 16. 9.
humble themselves under the hand of their governors; they are to obey in Luke
17. 7. 8 etc.
labor and attendance, in service Genesis 2* 4, 2* 4*
at home or abroad, in peace Genesis 14. 14. 15*
or in war; and both master and servant ar to keep communion together in their
holy faith, (wherein is Iam. 2. 1.
no respect of persons,) without oppression, f^awd, murmuring, or debate; til
they end their days in peace, and come to the place appointed for all the
living; where small and great do lodge together, and Job. 3. 19.
the servant free from his master.

6. This much of families, which being well ordered, and conjoined in the faith
of Christ, are as little churches, so caled by Romans 16. 5.
the Apostle; and ought to have care, whatsoever 1 Cor. 16. 19,
be done in others, that Ios 24, 15. Genesis 35, 2.
Gods true worship be continewed in them. The second sort of humane society,
is in Policies or Commune weals; which may be diversely co^stituted, lesser or
greater, and under sundry sorts of government. As, many families co^pact
together in one Number. 1. 18. 20 22 etc.
tribe; many tribes in one Exo. 19. 6. Act, ^0. 22.
nation or Kingdom; many kingdoms in Ezr. 1. 2. Luke 2. 1.
one Empire; and these menaged by one or by many; by Number. 7. 2.
Princes, Number. 11 16 17.
S^natouis, Act. 13. 20.
Judges, verse. 2.
Kings or Act 25. 11. 12.
Kaesa^s, as God shall dispose, and the public states see best. For Romans 13. 1.
al powers are of God, what soever be their names, titles *dignities or forms
of regiment; and when or howsoever they be altered at the discretion of man,
(in respect whereof they are caled 1 Pet. 2. 13.
^^mane or creatures (...).
creations* or ordinances,) they are to be submitted unto for the Lords sake.
And this though they be unbelievers; how much more if they also beleev, and have
brought their glory to the Church of Christ, and have their Ezekiel. 48. 21
portion in the holy land.

7. These magistrates if they be freely chosen of the church, must be of their
Deuteronomy. 17. 15
brethren, Deuteronomy. 1. 13. 15. etc,
men of wisdom and good conscience, who must judge al causes aright, and
govern the people in justice, 2 Samuel 23. 3.
and in the fear of God: whom the Commons are to honor, submit unto, and
reverence, Psalm. 72. 9. 10. 15. Romans 13. 6. 7. Jude. 8.
in deed, word, and gesture, as to the Lord; for John. 10. 35.
the word of God is committed unto them, and they therefore ar caled Psalm. 82.
6. Exodus 21. 6.
Gods. This subjection is due unto al, whither 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14.
unto the King as to the superior, or unto the Governors, as they that are sent
of him. It must be both openly and Eccles. 10 20
secretly, even Romans 13. 5.
of conscience, and not for fear of wrath only. The communion of the faith, is
not a cause, why either princes should forsake their place, titles, or
dignities; or the people shake off their subjection. For seeing Magistracy is
still Gods Romans 13. 1. 2 3.
ordinance; none ar meeter to execute it, to have his word and sword committed
to the^, to carry his titles, and to judge in his congregation, then his own
servants 2 Chronicles. 1. 10 11. 12. Number. 11. 17*
furnished with his spirit. And seeing it is still his Romans 13. 4. 6.
ministry for the good of his people, ye punishment of malefactors, and
praise of weldoers; none ca^ better perform this duty, and be Isa, 49. 23.
noursing fathers and mothers of Christ's church, then Christians* Kings are not
to cast away, but Revel. 21, 24
bring their glory and honor to Jerusalem, (as the gentiles do their Isa. 60.
5. 6. 9. 11.
riches,) and themselves to verse. 10.
minister thereunto.

8. In which ministration, they both Ezekiel. 45. 17
mainteyn and conserve the true religion of God according to his word, and
reform things amiss, in themselves and their subjects, (as is Chap. 17. Sect.
10.
before touched:) and also mainteyn civil peace, by executing Psalm. 101. 1.
mercy and judgment, Psalm 82 3. 4
justifying and delivering the poor and needy, and Psalm. 72. 4.
beating down the oppressor. Such magistrates Job. 29. 15. 16. 17.
are eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, fathers to the poor; whose cause when
they know not, they seek out diligently; breaking the jaws of the unrighteous
man, and plucking the prey out of his teeth. And as their sword preserves
peace at home, so Judge. 11. 27. 29. etc. 2 Chro. 32. 1. 2. 5. 6. etc.
it resists injuries from abroad; that they are not only ornaments of
common weals, but their safety and strength under God; and may well be caled,
(as the Prophets name them,) the Psalm. 47. 9 and 89. ^8. Hos. 4. 18.
Shields of the world. For which cause, all Christians as they may (by Act. 22.
25. 28. and. 25. 10. 11.
Paul's example) be partakers of the benefit of their laws politic; so do they
ow Rom 13. (...) 5. 6*
homage, service, and subjection unto the^, should allow them maintenance, pay
them tributes, and other like duties; in recompense of their cares, labors,
and employments: that so mutual peace and concord in the communion of the
Saints, may all manner ways be conserved.

9. There remains yet an other sort of civil duties among the Saints,
general unto al, married or unmarried, bond or free, magistrate or subject; which
are, love, mercy, relief, kindenes, courtesy, and many other the like sociable
actions, at al times to be performed, of al persons as there is occasion, and
according to their power and place. For Christians are to have care of those 1
These. 5. 12 13.
that labor among them, a^ over them in the Lord, and admonish them; that they
have them in singular love for their works sake, and let the^ 1 Cor. 9. 11.
reap their carnal things, which sow unto them spiritual. For God which willed
Israel to beware Deuteronomy. 12. 19
that they forsakt not the Levite, as long as they lived upon the earth, Deu.
14. 27
because he had neither part nor inheritance with them, but was busied in Deuteronomy.
33. 10
teaching them the law, and other ministerial actions, Deuteronomy. 10. 8. ^.
for which the Lord himself would be his inheritance: has also ordained, 1.
Cor. 9. 14.
that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel. And seeing for
the service of Christ in that warfare, 2 Timothy 2. ^.
they entangle not themselves with the affairs of life, because they would
please him that has chosen the^ to be soldjers: they should have Phili. 4. 1^.
16.
their wants supplied by the church, that they be not forced to war 1 Cor. 9. 7.
at their own cost; but may ^a^ of the milk of the flock which they feed, and
be made partakers Gal. 6. 6.
of al their goods; which will not only be an encouragement to them in their
ministry, but also turn to the great good of such as reliev them, as it is
written, ye Ezekiel. 44. 30
shall give unto the Priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the
blessing to rest upon thy house. And together with them, the poor, the
strangers, the fatherless, and the widows, (as was the manner Deu. 14. 2^
in Israel,) are also to be releived; to them we must Deuteronomy. 15. ^.

grief of heart, and eve^ freely, Luk 6. 35.
looking for nothing again, but expecting a blessing and reward from God*
Pilgroms and strangers are Heb. 13. 2.
to be harbored; our brethren in bo^^ verse. 3.
to be remembered, as though we were bound with them; Isa. 58 7. Job. 31. 16. 17
18. 19. Mat. 25. 35. 36. Iam* 1* ^7.
the nake to be clothed; the hungry sowl filled; the sick and distressed, to
be visited, tended, and comforted; and al other good works, which are to be
done unto al men, Galat. 6. 10.
especially to them which are of the howshold of faith. For these works of
mercy, are better Hos. 6. 6.
then sacrifices; they are Philip. 4. 18
odours that smell sweet, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God, who can
make ^ Cor. 9. 8. 9

things, may abound in every good work, to an everlasting memory of our
justice, the verse. 13. 14* 15. 26.
prayers of the Saints for us, with praise and thanks unto God for his
unspeakable gifts. These humane duties, are so united unto true religion, as
God of old commanded them on his Sabbathes and solemn Deuteronomy. 16. 1^ 14. Nehem. ^
10.
feasts; Christ has ordained Act. 6. 1. 2. etc. Romans 1^. 8. and* 16. 1. ^ 1 Timothy 3. 12. and 5. 9. 10.
Deacons in his Church, and other Helpers for this ministration; besides the
general care of all the faithful; and on every 1 Cor. 16. 1 ^*
first day of the week, (which were days of the churches Act. 20. 7. Ioh. 20.
19.
asse^blies,) such care and provisio^ for the poor was made. yea when occasion
so required, the Christians Act. 2. 45.
sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men as every one had
need; which work the Act. 4. 3^* 35. 37.
Apostles themselves a while looked unto. Good therefore and comfortable is it
for all the Saints that have this worlds good, to do good and to distribute,
Heb. 13. 1^*
because with such sacrifices God is well pleased; that they be rich in good
works, and ready to communicate; that with the godly Tyrians, Isa. 23 1^.
their occupying and their gain may be holy unto the Lord; whiles they hoord
it not up, nor keep it in store, but let it be for them that dwell before the
Lord, for food and clothing: by this means 1 Timothy 6. 18 (...).
laying up in store for themselves, a good foundation against the time to come,
that they may obteyn eternal life.

10. Concerning other Christian offices special regard must be had in all our
actions of reverence and lov; for toward superiors, and the aged, men must
show al honor in giving them their Luke 1. 3. Act 26. 25. 2 Job. 1.
titles of dignity, when ^ Lev. 19. 32. 1 King. 1. 16. ^3. Ruth. 2. 10
they speak or write unto them; rising up; and bowing down before them for
honor sake; they may not 1 Timothy* 5. 1* 1 Samuel 1. 14 15.
rebuke, but exhort them as fathers, they are to giv them Luk* 14. 7. 8. 9. 10.
the upper places, and suffer them Job. 32. 4. 6. 7.

children and as brethren; yet as they may deserv, Tit. 1. 13. 3. Ioh. 10. Number.
32. 6. 7. -- 14.
sharply to rebuke also. Amongst al, there should be, in behavior, seemlines
and Ephesians. 4. 32.
courtesy; in giving honor, Romans 12. 10
to go one before an other; 1 Thessalonians. 5. 26. 1 Cor. 16. 20.

embracing of friends, as there is occasion. In words, Tit. 3. 2. Gal. 5. 23.

lawful means be preserved amongst us during life; and when we are parted by
death, the living to Luke 7. 12. ^ Sam. 3. ^1. etc.

11. In this manner men carrying themselves, toward God whom they serve with
reverence and with fear, and adore in spirit and truth; also to their
neighbors, with who^ they are coupled in peace and amity: the Ezech. 34. 26.

them; Levit. 26. 11. 12.

will cloth them Isa. 61. 1^.

adorn them with his graces, as a bride garnisheth her self with her jewels.
Here will he make unto al people, Isa. 25. ^.

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: let them prosper that love thee.

beloved city; it shall be therefore good, that we take a view of these troubles
and assaults, learn of God the end and use of them, and how we may either
escape or overcome them, least we be offended and our faith fayl.

2. That old crooked serpent, the enemy of man's salvation, perceiving the
uniting and communion of the Saints, to be a great help and furthera^ce of
their happiness; a praise to their God, a daunting to the world, and a comfort
to themselves: does therefore bend his utmost might and malice against this
brotherhood, that he may dissolve the same. He stirs up the wicked
multitudes, like the raging waves of the sea, that some out mire and dirt, to
belly and blaspheme the truth and witnesses of Christ, accusing them of Act. 17.
18. and 24. 5. 14. Nehem. 6. 6. 7.
noveltie, heresy, sedition, treason, and rebellion. He further kindles this
fire, by his Amos. 7. 10. Luke 23. 2. Ioh 19. 7. 12.
false Prophets, that cease not to inveigh against, and calumniate this little
flock; and by their abused wit and learning, to prove and persuade that they
are as bad or worse then they be reported of, both for their faith toward God,
and loyalty to the princes of the earth. which princes also, for like 1 Kin.
22. 8.
malice in themselves, or for that they Number 22. 3. 4. Mat. 2. 3.
fear the loss or impeachment of their honor and dignities; or because they
loath Psalm 2. 3.
the bonds and yoke of the gospel; or Act. 12. 3. and 24. 28.
for to gratify their people and subjects; are ready to turn the dint of
their sword, (wherewith they should conserv the truth and peace of Christian
religion,) against the Saints, and especially their communion and assemblies;
which seem most dangerous, and are indeed terrible to the world, as an Song. 6.

3. Herevpo^ they think to Exodus 1. 1^.
work wisely, if any way they can hinder the propagation and increase of the
church; whither by privy oppression, or open persecution: though the wisdom of
God has said, Pro. 17. 16.
Sure^ it is not good to condemn the just; (...) that princes should smite for
equity. Especially the Exodus 4. 16. ^2.
men-children, the teachers, guides, and principal of Christ's flock, are most
maligned, and exposed to their tyranny: though so^time neither women nor
infants, can be exempted from their rage and cruelty. For which, these civil
polities, with the heads and governors of the^, unto whom erewhile it was said
Psalm. 82. 6.
ye ar Gods and ye al are children of the most high; ar now become more base
then any men; and are caled in holy scripture, Zep. 3. 3. Pro 28. 15. Dan. 7,
4. 5. 6. Psa. 80. 13. Luke. ^3. 31. 32.
Lio^s, Wolves, bears, Libbards, wild-bores, and foxes, even pourtrahed out by
Dan. ^. 7. 8. Rev. 13. 1. ^.
monstrous, savage, and deformed bestes; for such their barbarous havoc, and
misusage of the Saints.

4. For lo, in their malignant hearts, they fret against Number. (...). ^.
the people of God, and against Dan. 11. ^0.
the holy covenant; with their mouths they speak evil, even Dan. 11. 36. and
7. 8.
marveilous and presumptuous things, Rev. 13. 6.
blaspheming Gods name and tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; with their
hands and horns they smite and push the poor flock of Christ, Heb. 10. 34.
Rev. 1. 9. Ier. 38. 6. 1 King. 22. 27. Act. 8 3.
spoiling them of their goods, banishing them out of their dominions, casting
them into prisons and dungeons, feeding the^ with bread of adversity and water
of affliction; devising all cruel and exquisite torments, to make their death
miserable, Heb. 11. 35. 36. 37. Dan. 3. 19. 20. and 6. 16.
racking, stoning, ha^ging, hewing in pieces, burning in fire, casting to wild
beasts, and many more horrible tortures; as the lambs of Christ have felt in all
ages; whiles children have been brought Exodus 1. 22. Mat. 2. 16.
from the womb to their martirdom; and ^ king. 8. 12.
women with child, ripped up in their unnatural cruelty.

5. By this means, the communion of the Saints is often times dissolved and Act
8. 1.
scattred; their shepherds and watchmen Act. 2. 1. 2. etc.
apprehended and killed; the whole flock pursued, as Romans 8. 36.
sheep appointed to the slaughter. Some for fear deny and forsake the faith,
and are Act. 26. 11.
compelled to blaspheme. Some by flattery are Dan. 11. 30. 32.
caused to syn, and wickedly break the holy covenant, and to be the betrayers
of their brethren. Such as escape these evils, sometime Heb. 11. 37. 38.
wander up and down in sheeps skins and goat skins, destitute, afflicted, and
tormented, in deserts and mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. Thus
waters of a full cup ar wrung out unto them; and now the Lam. 1. 4.
ways of Sion lament, because no man comes to the solemn fests; for Dan. 1^.
38.
the daily sacrifice (whereby they were wont publicly to worship God,) is
taken away, and abominable desolation put in the place. The Psalm. 74. ^. 8.
sanctuary and synagogues of God are burned; Ier. 52. 7. Psalm. 79. 1. 2. 3.
Jerusalem broken up, made a ruinous heap, the stones thereof laid in dust, and
the dead bodies of the Saints, cast to the fowls and bestes of the earth.
Then the faithful mourn, because God has Lam. 2. 6. ^.
destroyed his congregation, caused the sabbaths to be forgotten, forsaken his
sanctuary, and given into the enemies hand the walls of her palaces: their
eyes verse. 1^.
fayl with tears, their bowels swel, their liver is powered upon the earth; and
they cry out with the Prophet, Amos. 7. 2. ^*
O Lord God, spare we beseech thee: who shall raise up Iaakob, for he is small.

6. Thus God who has Isa. 31. 9.
his fire in Sio^, and furnace in Jerusalem, melts his metal, Mal. 3. 3.
tries and fineth his people as silver, and purifieth the^ as gold, by the
Isa. 4. 4.
spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning; draws them to repentance, by
chastening Lam. 3. 39. 40. 4^.
them for their syns, and making judgment 1 Pet. 4. 17.
to begin at his own house; co^suming the dross, and making known them, that are approved* that the ^ Pet. 1. 7.
trial of their faith being much more precious the^ gold that perishes,
(though it be tried with fire,) may be found unto praise and honor and glory,
at the appearing of Jesus Christ. For not withstanding all the rage of the
persecutors, God will preserv to himself Romans 9. 27. 29.
a little flock, unto whom he will be Ezekiel. 11. 16
a little Sanctuary, in all places where they are dispersed: who in this their
desolation, yet pray with their faces 1 king. 8. 47 48. Dan. 6. 10.

consider Christ their head, who for the joy that was set before him, endured
the cross, and despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne
of God; who when he was both in name and power a Lion, appeared Revel. ^4^. ^
as a Lamb killed; yet behold Rev. 1. 18.
he is alive for evermore, Amen; and has the keys of hell and of death. And he
it is, that raises up his children fio^ death; he will prophecy, and their

shall come together, sinews and flesh shall grow upon them, breath shall
enter into the^, and they stand upon their feet an exceeding great army. For in
their tribulations, they have but washed their garments Rev. 7. 14.
white in his blood; and this is all the fruit, Isa. ^7. 9.
the taking away of their syn; and the more the adversaries vex them, thinking
to root them out, Exodus 1. 12.
the more they multiply and grow: by patient suffering, they triumph; and by
dying daily, they attayn to life eternal. And God who has chastened the^ with
rods for their good, will turn his hand upon their enemies, and scourge the^
with scorpio^s; they shall Psalm. 75. 8.
wring out and drink the dreggs of this cup of wrath; he that made them Isa.
27. 11.
will not have compassion of them, and he that formed them will have no mercy
on them; the beasts shall be destroyed Dan. 7. 11.
and given to the burning fire, and the righteous shall Psalm. 49. 14.
have dominion over them in the morning. The zele of the Lord of hosts will
perform it.

The Lord preserves the sowles of his Saints, he will deliver them from the
hand of the wicked.

Psalm. 97. 10. CHAPT. XXI.
How the peace and communion of the Church, is disturbed by troubles, and syns
within it self.

But it is a small thing for Satan thus to molest the Saints with troubles from
abroad; for he has means and instruments many in the church it self, to work
the woe, yea often the ruin of the same; and he most delights to kindle
contentions among brethren, knowing that such things are most offensive unto
God, heavy to his people, and give to the enemy occasion of reproach. The
means are two, that he chiefly uses hereunto; 1. the infirmities of the
Saints, who though they would do good, yet through syn that dwells in the^,
often times do the evil which they hate; 2. and the iniquities of false brethren
and hypocrites; who always are corrupted in themselves, and seek to bring
corruption into the whole body of the church.

2. For when the faithful through common ^iaylty, defyle their precious sowles
and bodies, through the remaynders of ^yn; both the enemies without take
occasion to 2 Samuel 12. 14.
blaspheme; and the brethren within to stumble and contend: as Moses was
murmured against by his own sister and brother, Number. 12. ^.
because he had married an Ethiopian wife. And God himself is often angry with
the whole church, and punishes many, for the fault of a few; as when David 1 Chronicles. 2^* 1. 2.
sinned in numbering the people, God in displeasure plagued Israel, verse. 7. 1^.
that of them there died seventie thousand men. Again, the homebred wars and
dessentions, are heavier to the brethrens hearts, then al forreyn troubles, and
many weak ones are offended, no less then was Rebekah, who feeling the
children to strive in her body, made question of her conception, and said,
Genesis 25. (...)*
If it be so, why am I thus? But above al, the hypocrites in heart, do increase
wrath, and oft-times molest the church, of which they 1 Ioh. 2. 19
are not, though they be in the same, (like the 1 king. 10. 2^*
Apes and peacocks in Solomo^s ships;) being in deed the serpents seed, and
apperteyning to an other kingdom then Christ's; yet are thrust among the
Saints through Satan's malice, for to annoy them; God also permitting this for
the trial of his elect. By these means, the little bark of Christ's church,
hathever been tossed as with winds and tempests; and is like ever to be, so l^g
as it is on the seas of this world: that none may look for Angelical
perfection, or absolute peace upon the earth.

3. The Saints ar subject, (if they be not wary, and have their wits exercised
to discern good and evil,) to Heb. 13. 9.
be carried about with diverse and, strange doctrines; to fall into errors
heresies, and idolatries; Satan rayseth up even among the teachers of the
church, Act. 20. 30.
some speaking perverse things to draw disciples after the^, and the people
many of them ar through their own corruption prone unto vice, even set Exo.
3^. 22
on mischief. The children of Israel living in Aegipt, defiled themselves with
Ezekiel. 2^* 7. 8.
the abominations and idols of that land; being brought out into the wilderness,
and informed in the statuts of the Lord, they there rebelled ^ verse. 10 12. 13.
against him, sinned still, and Psalm. 78. 17. 40. 41.
provoked the most High, tempted God, and limited the holy one of Israel, made
them a molten calf, Exodus 32. Ne^e^. 9. 18.
and said this is thy God o Israel that brought thee out of the la^d of Aegipt,
and committed great blasphemies. When they were entered into the good la^d
promised to their fathers, there also they Psalm. 206. 3^* 36.
mingled themselves among the hethen, and learned their works, and served their
idols, which were their ruin. False prophets there were many among them, that
Ier. 23. 13. 14. 17.
seduced the people to error and idolatry, strengthened their hands in evil,
preached peace to ye wicked, Ezekiel. 1^. 1^* 18. 19.
and put pillowes under their arms; but smote the righteous, grieved and
killed (what in the^ lay,) the sowls of such as should not have died. False
teachers, (the 2 Pet. 2. 1. 2.
Apostle says) there will be also amongst us, which privily shall bring in
damnable heresies, eve^ denying the Lord that has bought them. The primitive
churches had woeful experience hereof, whiles in Galatia they were Gal. 1. 6. 7.
etc.
soon remooved away to an other gospel, being bewitched by their misleaders,
who under pretense of the law of God, Chapt. 5. 4.
abolished them from Christ, and made them fall from grace. And in many other
churches, false doctrine fretted as a canker, and destroyed the faith of
certain, whiles some taught 2 Timothy 2. 17 18. 1 Cor. 15. 12.
the resurrection was past already; some with Iezabel and Balaa^ persuaded Rev.
2. 14. ^5. 20.
to eat of things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication, with other
hateful doctrine of the Nicolaita^s, idolatrous doctrine of Colos. 2. 18. 19.
worshipping Angels, Christ the head being let go; the grace of God Jude. ver.
4.
turned to wantonness, and God the only Lord and our Lord Jesus Christ, denied;
Antichrist, even 1 Ioh. 2. 18.
many Antichrists entered in, to deceyv and destroy men's sowles.

4. By such seducers, much trouble and discord was wrought among the people,
some of ignorance, some of wilfulnes receiving and walking in their Ier. 23. 32.
errors; by whom the 2 Pet. 2. 2.
way of truth was evil spoken of: others opposing against them, and Jude. 3.
earnestly contending for the faith once given to the Saints. Especially the
Apostles, and other trusty ministers of Christ, (to whose care the sowles of
men were committed,) set themselves against those falsers, by 2 Cor. 6. 7
the word of truth, by the power of God, and by the armor of righteousness on
the right hand and on the left: 1 Timothy 1. 3.
commanding me^ to teach no other doctrine, nor give heed thereto, but 2 Timothy
1. 13.
keep the true pattern of wholesome words, in faith and love which is in Christ
Jesus; exhorting thereunto, Tit. 1. 9. (...). 1^.
improving and convincing them that spoke against it, stopping their mouths,
and rebuking them sharply that they might be sound in the faith. Those again
like 8 Tim. 3. 8.
Iannes and Iambres resisting the truth, with 2 Timothy 2. 1^. ^ Tim. 6. 5.
profane vayn bablings, disputations, and oppositions of science falsely so
caled, and 3 John. 10.
prating against them with malicious words; and seeking to ^ Cor. 10. 10
disgrace them. And well was it with the churches then, whiles those circumspect
careful watchmen the Apostles and Evangelists lived among them, and took those
Song. 2. 15.
foxes which destroyed the Lords vines: but after their departure, there entered
Act. 20. 29.
grievous wolves, not sparing the flock; as by the innumerable heresies, and
lamentable decay of churches since their time does appear.

5. As for doctrine, so about many other things also, contention has often
risen through men's infirmities, Prove. 10. 1^ and. 13. 10.
malice, and pride: that by errors in faith, and corruptions in ma^ners, as by
a double chain of iniquity, many sowles have been fettered and afflicted. For
some moved Act. 7 9.
with envy, have sold their brethren to aliants, and sought for Genesis 27. 41.
and 37. 20.
tokil them: some through ambition would clime above their caling; and Number. 16.
1. 2. 7. 9. 10.
intrude into higher offices; presuming upon their own verse. 3.
holiness, and seeking to disgrace others. And as the church of Israel was
infamous Deuteronomy. 9. 22. 23. 24. and 29 4.
al Moses days, for their idolatries, rebellions, and many murmurings, for
which they carkesses fell in the wilderness; and strife and Exodus 32. 2^. 27. 28.
bloodshed came among them: so after that they were seated in the land of
Canaan, they continewed not long in peace together, but tribe with tribe Iud.
12. and 20. 2 Samuel 2. and 3. 1. 1 Kin 14. 30. and 15. 7. 16. 32. etc. Isa. 9.
20. 21.
made war, and rent themselves asunder, to the great reproach of Gods true
religion, and giving advantage to the commune adversary, to invade and
dispossess them of their land. Yea even in families betwee^ brethren, parents
and children, most bitter and bloody strife brake forth, as the stories of
Judge. 9.
Abimelech, 2 Samuel 13.
Amnon and Absalom, 2 Samuel 15. etc.
Absalom and David, and sundry others do declare. Also how they were divided,
when Christ lived among the^, into Sects and factions, Pharisees, Saducees, and
other like: the history of the Gospel, every where shows. Neither were the
Christian Churches which the Apostles had planted, free of this ^even; but
contentions among the^ grew unto schisms and factions, 1 Cor. 1. 1^. 12 etc.
whiles sundry men followed and re(...)ed upon sundry Teachers; in their public
meetings also, 1 Cor. 11. 18 19.
dissentions were among them. Some ministers would of strife and envy Philip.
1. 15. 16.
preach Christ to the people; some loving the praeeminence, would tyrannyze
over the flock, forbidding to receiv brethren sent by the Apostles, and 3 John.
^. 10.
thrusting them out of the Church. And amongst Gods elect, most faithful
servants, and loving friends, Satan did his utmost to kindle the coals of
emulation, dissension, and strife; as between Genesis 13. 7. 8
Abraham and Lot, Number. 12. 1.
Moses and Aaron, Gal. 2. 11. 14.
Peter and Paul, Act. 15. 38. 39.
Paul and Barnabas; and among the Apostles generally, when there was contention
Luke 2^. 24. 25.
who should be greatest, till they had learned better of their master Christ.

6. The poison of syn has spread it self exceeding far in churches, and
corrupted the manners and actions of al degrees. For Magistrates leaving the
love and cherishing of the people, Isa. 1. 2^.
loved gifts, and followed after rewards; judged not the fatherles, neither did
the widows cause come before them: they Mic. 3. 1. 2. 3 Zeph. 3. 3.
plucked off their skins from them, and their flesh from their bones, did eat
their flesh and break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot.
Again the subjects Jude. verse. 8.
despised and spoke evil of their rulers, Psalm. 3. 1. 2. 3
rose up and rebelled against them. The rich were unmerciful, and Mic. 6. 12.
cruel to the poor; Among the people and brethren of the church, was bitter
Iam. 3. 14. 16. 10.
envying, strife, sedition, and reproach; every man Mic. 6. 2. 5. ^er. 9. 4.
hunted his brother with a net, that they could not trust in any friend, but
must beware even of her that lay in their bosom. The teachers were Tit. 1. 10.
11
vayn talkers and deceivers of minds, subverting whole howses, teaching things
which they ought not, for filthy lucre sake; the priests Zeph. ^. 4.
wrested the law; the Prophets were like Ezech. 13. 4
foxes in the wast places, and from them wickedness Ier. 23. 15.
went forth into all the land. Thus judgment was turned into wormwood, faith
into heresy, Gods grace into wantonness, the liberty of his Gospel made a
cloak of maliciousnes; and in sted of the gracious ornaments of his spirit,
there was Rev. 3. 17.
wretchedness, misery, poverty, blindness and nakedness; they had a name to be
alive, verse. 1.
but were dead. Nor this alone; for they hated such as rebuked them, and would
not admit of reproof, but Ier. 5. 3.
made their faces harder then a stone; they killed the prophets Mat. 23 37.
and stoned those that were sent unto them; even when Christ himself came among
them, they would not receiv him, but said, this is the heir, Luke (...). 1^
come let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.

7. These and many more like evils have crept into the Churches of God, whereby
they have been troubled, distracted, and rent in pieces; much pople have been
defiled and corrupted, and the Saints have had cause to complayn Isa. 9. 3.
Thou have multiplied the nation, but have not increased their joy. Against
these, the ministers and witnesses of the Lord, have cried out in their several
ages; being sent and rising early to recall the sinners into the right way. Who
were threatened, that Micah. 3. 12.
Sion for their sakes should be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem made a ruinous
heap, Math. 23 ^ 38.
and her habitation left unto her desolate; that Christ would Rev. 2. 16.
war against the^ with the sword of his mouth, and verse. 5.
remove the candlestick out of the place, except they amended. And such as
hearkened to the voice of their God, and turned unto him; had their iniquities
forgiven, and their crimsin syns Isa. 1. 18.
made white as snow: but such as obeyed not, were verse. 20.
devoured of the sword; and Isa. 3. 9.
woe was unto their sowles, for they rewarded evil unto themselves; and were
caled Ier. 6. 30.
reprobate silver, because the Lord rejected them.

8. Thus comes it to pass, through Satan's malice, and men's corruption, that
the city of God, of which so glorious things are spoken in the scriptures;
seems more vile and contemptible then any other place; the spowse of Christ
appears Song. 1. 4.
black, which was named the verse. 7.
fairest among women; her foes which Psalm. 48. 5. 6.
feared and marveyled at her, do hiss and say, Lam. 2. 15
Is this the city that men call, The perfection of bewty, the joy of the whole
earth? her children, to whom Isa. 54. 13
much peace was promised; do Ezekiel. 9. 4.
mourn and cry, for the many abominations that are done in the mids of her;
and from the daughter Zion* Lam. 1. 6.
al her beauty is departed; being thus persecuted by the Dragon, hated and
reproched of the world, molested and forsaken of her own children, misvsed and
Song. 5. 7.
wounded of her watchmen, to the grief and affliction of her spirit.

9. And if there were not a healing of this error in time, but the gangrene
suffered to spread and fret; it grew at length incurable, brought death and
desolation upon the diseased Churches. For God after many warnings and Isa. 1.
5. 6.
much correction, did at length disclaym the faithful city as verse. 21.
a harlot, giv her Ier. 3. 8.
a bil of divorse, and put her away; Hos. 2. 2.
she was no more his wife, nor he her husband; Ezekiel. 23. 18
his heart forsook her, he left his heritage, he gave the Ier. 12. 7.
dearly beloved of his sowl, into the hands of her enemies; and Ezekiel. 9. 3. and
10. 4. 18. 19 and 11 23.
removed his glory from amids her. Then Jerusalem became, with all the
inhabitants thereof Ier. 23. 14.
as Sodom and Gomorrah: the Ezekiel 22, 18.
house of Israel was reputed as dross, the congregation of the Romans 1. 7.
Saints, turned to an Rev. 18. 2.
habitation of divils. And the Lords people that feared his name were willed
Rev. 18. 4.
to forsake and come out from among them, to judge them Ezekiel. 23. 45.
as harlots, to Hos. 2. 2.
plead against them, and Hos. 4. 15. 17. etc.
forsake al communion with them. Wherevpo^ followed again most bitter strife,
hatred Micah. 2 100 Ier. 16* 5. 6. 7. 8. Act. 3^ 40.
and persecution, whiles they that refreyned from evil, Isa. 5^. 15.
made themselves a prey, and suffered al manner of misusage and affliction at
their hands which made Rev. 17. 6
themselves drunken with the blood of the Saints, and yet boasted to be the
church and spowse of Christ, when they were the Rev. 3. 9.
synagogue of Satan.

10. This is the troublous estate of the church of God on earth, more tossed
and tormented then any other people; of which church, (by reason of the many
hypocrites and vessels of 2 Timothy 2. 20.
dishonor that are therein,) though the number were as the sand of the sea, Romans
9. 2^
yet but a remnant shall be saved; and except the Lord of hosts verse. 29.
had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and had been like to Gomorrah.
For which cause, it behooveth the Saints, to seek the Lord while he may be
found, and medicine, while the disease is curable; for Christ has ordained
ways and means, for the purging of his church from corruptions; or at least,
for his elect to keep themselves pure and unspotted of these syns; of which it
remains to be spoken in the next place.

CHAPT. XXII.
How the Communion of Saints, may be purged of the evils that arise therein, by
the power and censures of Christ: and how needful it is for the Saints al, to
look hereunto.

The Lord Jesus, who is the author of grace and salvation unto his people, is
also the finisher of the same, and performer of his good work toward them; and
as he ^uod. 15. 25 26.
sweetened with a tree, the bitter waters of Marah, where also he made Israel an
ordinance, promising that if they would hearken to his voice, he would free
them from all the diseases of Aegipt: so has he set and showed us in the
gardein of his church, Rev. ^2. 2. Ezekiel. 47. 12.
the tree of life, whose fruit is for meat, and leaves for medicine, to heal
the nations with; that there is no disease incurable to his obedient people, but
in all their troubles, tentations, offenses, fears, and other sowl-sicknesses;
when they cry unto (...), (...) Psalm. 107. 20
sends his word and heals (...) and delivers them sio^ their graves of
corruption. Most wholesome laws ar left unto al churches, to redress the evils
that arise within the^; which being wisely handled and applied, by those whose
tongues ar also Prove. 15. 2. 4.
t^^es of life; are more effectual then the balm I^r. 8. 22.
of Gilead, to recover the health of the daughter Sio^, though Bables sore Ier.
51. 8. 9.
cannot be cured.

2. And first, the Saints as they are most nearly united together in one body;
so in the bowels of love and mercy, they are to tender e^^ one his neighbor
L^vit. 19. 18.
as himself, And seeing al men have their Psalm. 38. 4.
burden of syns and infirmities upon them* we are exhorted to Gal. 6. 2.
bear one an others burden, and so fulfill the law of Christ. If occasions the^
of offense be offered by misspeaki^g; we should remember, that he that synneth
not in word is Iam. 3. 2.
a perfect man and in many things, we sin all; and that therefore we take that
which* is spoken* in the best part, bear hard words with meeknes of spirit, not
rendering again evil for evil, but with a Prove. 15. ^
soft answer to put away wrath. If actions seem offensive, or begin to breed
strife; love will teach us* 1 Cor. 13. 4. ^
not to be provoked to anger, but with long sufferance to bear al things; and
to seek by all gentleness to compound the controversy, for it is a man's Prove.
20. 3.
honor to cease* from strife: therefore as Gods elect holy and beloved, we
should Colos. 3. 12. 13
forbear and forgiv one another, eve^ as Christ forgave us. Thus by loving and
gentle demeanure, Genesis 13. ^. 9
Abram stayed strife between Lo^ and him; Judge. 8. 1. 2. 3.
Gedeon, between the Ephramits and him; 1 Samuel 17. 28. 29. 30.
David, betwee^ his soldiers: Moses sought to do y^ like* 1 Samuel 30. 2^ 23. 24.
between two Israelits: and we ought al in the love of Christ to labor thus to
do; for when offenses arise, it shall be out glory if we can pass them by, as
Prove. 19. 11
Solomon has said.

3. But if the trespass be such as we may not but insist upon, both for the
honor of God who is offended, and sowl of the sinner which is endangered, and
o^ own or neighbors good, who ar endammaged thereby: then (...) we bound to
admonish the trespasser hereof, observing two rules, 1. Loving carriage as
becomes brethren; 2. and secrecy, to co^cese the fault as much as we may. For
the first, as al our things 1 Cor. 16. 14
(...) be done in Love; so when a man ^ fallen by occasion into any fault, we
are willed to restore him with 1 Gal. 6. 1.
the spirit of meeknes, considering our selves least we also be tempted. For
the second, we are taught to Prove. 25. 9.
debate the matter with our neighbor himself, and not to discover the secret
to another; but to tell him his fault Mat. 18. 25.
between us and him alone. And if by our reproof he do repent, then is he won
or gained, his sowl Iam. 5. 20.
saved from death, and we are to Luk, 17. 3. Ephesians. 4. 32.
forgiv him in tenderness of heart, as God for Christ's sake has forgive^ us; and
in love we ought to co^cele his transgression and bury the same, not Prove. 11.
13.
discovering it to others, nor Prove. 17. 9. and 16. 28.
repeting it to himself; for such dealing makes division among principal
friends. But if he hear not our private admonition, then should we take with us
Mat. 18. 16.
one or two, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be
confirmed; and that so by 2 Cor. 13. 1. 2
the second or third admonition, he may either be reclaimed, or not spared, but
brought to further blame and censure. And if he will not vouchsafe to hear the^,
then ar we to tell it* Mat. 18. 17.
unto the Church. where he may be rebuked of 1. Cor. 2. 6.
many: and if he refuse to hear the church also, then is he by the 1 Cor. 5. 4.
power of Christ, which is given thereunto for the judging of al verse. 12.
within the same, to be verse. 13.
cast out from among the Saints when they are assembled, and to be delivered
unto verse. 5.
Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus; and whiles he remains in that impenitencie and
excommunicate estate; al Christians ar to Romans 16. 17. 1 Co. 5. 11. Man. 18. 17.
avoid him, and al communion with him, as the Jews avoided hethens and
publicans.

4. The keeping of this rule, causes much peace in the communion of the
Saints; for by this orderly dealing with the party all whispering,
Backbiting, slandering, and calumniating one of another, are stayed; syns which
reign in deed Romans 1. 29. 30.
among the profane work lings, and hethens; but are not Psalm. 15. 3. and 101. 57.
sufferable in the city of the Lord. By this, occasions of grief and
contention ar cut off: for as Prove. 26. 20.
without wood, the fire is quenched, so without a whisperer strife is silent.
By this, either the sinner is amended, whereat men and Luke 15. 9. 10
Angels do rejoice; or the church atleast weise purged of the evil: for Prove.
29. 1.
he that hardneth his neck, when he is often rebuked, shall suddenly be broken
off, and can not be cured; but the churches wound is cured hereby, as an other
proverb says, Prove. ^2. 10
Cast out the scorner, and strife shall go out: so contention and reproach shall
cease.

5. But if the syn be openly committed, then must the sinner be rebuked 1 Ti^.
5. 20.
openly, that others also may fear; or if it be of such a nature as tends to
the seducing of men from God, though he that entiseth be near and dear unto us;
we are forbidden to spare or keep him secret, for so may many be defiled by his
privy suggestions; Or if any secret hypocritical practice be seen to impeach
the truth of the Gospel or upright walking therein; such ought in public to be
reproved, as Galat. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14.
Paul for the like fault, blamed Peter before al me^. Or if the crime be
heighnous, bloody, and dangerous to ye life of others, by treason or treachery
such mischief is both to be Act 23. 16 17. etc. 1. king 1. 11. 12. 13. etc.
be^^ed, prevented, and punished; and bloodshed so defiles the land, (...) it
cannot be cleansed Number. 35. 33
but by the blood of him that shed it: such therefore (says Prove. 28. 17
Solomon) shall flee to (...) grave, let them not stay him.

6. The foresaid censures of Christ for rebuke and excommunication, ar to be
inflicted upon all the members of the church without respect of persons, as for
other Iam. 2. 1.
syns so specially for errors and heresies, and contentions against the true
faith. For an heretic must be rejected Tit. 3. 10.
after one and the second admonition; they that teach or receiv doctrines which
they ought not, must, be Tit. 1. 11. 13
rebuked sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, they that cause
divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine learned, Romans 16. 17
must be diligently marked and avoided; and such disquieters of the church, to
be Gal 5. 12.
cut off. Generally al Luk 17. 3.
sinners and al 1 These. 5. 14
unruly persons, ar liable to the Saints admonitions; and if any lust to be
contentious, 1 Cor. 11. 16
the churches of God have no such custom; for the Lord is author 1 Cor. 14. 3^
of peace in them al; neither may the wicked be suffered Psalm. 101. 4. 8. 1 Cor.
5. 12. 13.
to remayn in the communion of his people, but judgment Ier. 21. 12.
must be execued in the morning; neither may any Romans 1. 31.
favor evil doers; for he that justifies the wicked, him (says Prove. 24. ^4
29.
Solomon) shall the peoples curse, and the nations shall abhor him, but to them
that rebuke, that be pleasant(...) and upon them shall come the blessing of good.

7. The causes why the Saints must thus redress the evils that arise among
them, are these. First, for the glory of God, who commanded this duty in his
law Levit. 19. 17.
play^y to rebuke our neighbor; that so upon warning and sight of his syn,
Lev. 4. 23* 28.
he might bring his sacrifice and reconcile himself unto the Lord w^^ he had
offended; which if he reg^ded not, but should do oug(...) with a high hand, he
then was said Number. 15. 30 31.
to blaspheme the Lord, and must be (...) off from among his people, because
(...) despised the word of the Lord, (...) broke his commandment. God the who
is dishonored by men's transgressions, will again be glorified among them,
either by their Ios. 7. 19.
confession of, or Lev. 10. 3. Ezekiel. 28. 22.
punishment for the same. For his way is holy, the Isa. 35. 8.
polluted may not pass by it; they defile Number. 19. 20 22. Lev. 2^. 2 3 15.
his sanctuary and holy things; therefore they must sanctify themselves that
draw near unto him, for holiness Psalm. 93. 5.
becomes his house for ever.

8. Secondly, for the good of the sinner himself, who by these admonitions
rebukes and censures, is often-tymes bettered; especially if he be the Lords
elect. For a prudent man when he is reprooved, Prove. 19. 2^
will understand knowledge, and a rebuke sinketh more into him, Prove. 17. 10
then a hundred stripes into a fool: the ce^sures of the church ar for his 2
Cor. 2. 6.
hu^bling, and 1 Cor. 5. 5.
salvation of his spirit in the day of the Lord. We owe this therefore as a
duty of love unto our brethren, for their good; seeing love 1 Pet. 4. 9.
covers a multitude of syns; and that is done, when Iam. 5. 20.
we convert the sinner from going astray, and save his sowl from death. And
hervpo^ it was, that God gave that Law of rebukes in these words, Lev. 19. 17.
Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy (...) thou shall plainly rebuke thy
neigh^^^^ and Or, bear not syn for him* as Lev. 2^. 9.
suffer not syn upon him. For what greater hatred can there be showed, then to
see and suffer our brothers sowl to perish? therefore Solomon was not afraid to
say, that Prove. 27. 5.
open rebuke was better then secret love. And David minding this did desire
Psalm. 141. 5.
th^^ the righteous might smite him* f^^ it should be a benefit; and r(...)
him, for it should be a precious (...) which hewished might not fail^ (...)
being on his head. How ever then the wicked esteem of this heavenly ordinance,
and hate those that rebuke them, for which cause Christ forbad Mat. 7. 6.
to cast these holy thing^^ and pearls, to dogs and swine, which would but
rent the giver; and Solomon, Prove. 23. 9.
to speak in the ^ares of a fool, which would despise the wisdom of their
words* yet he says* Prove. ^. 8.
rebuke ^ wise man, and he will love th^^. And an other prophet shows, how men
that by such wounds are drawn to amendment of life, will acknowledge and say,
Zech. ^3. 6.
thus was I wounded in the house of my friends. To verify the proverb which
teaches, that howsoever the kisses of an enemy be pleasant, Prove. 27. 6.
the wounds of a lover are faithful.

9. A third cause of these censures, is the benefit of the church; that it may
be kept from the contagion and corruption of sinners, which is great and
dangerous. For in as much as they are al one body and brotherhood; the fault of a
few, yea even of one, may be a snare unto the whole company. This Israel felt
of old, when for Ios. 7. 1. 4.
Achans syn the Lord chastised the whole congregation, yea told them they were
verse. 12.
execrable, and said he would be with them no more, except they destroyed the
excerable thing from among them. And that correct^^ was a warning to the church
a good while after, Ios 22. 11. ^2. 16. 20.
and made them for fear of the like again, severely to look to their brethrens
actions, when they seemed evil in their eyes, and to say unto them, if* verse.
18.
we rebel to day against the Lord, even to mor^^^ he will be wroth with at the
congreg^* tion of Israel. This also the Church of Corinth felt, whiles for the
suffering 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2 etc.
of one wicked man as l^ven among them, the whole lump of the congregation was
so l^vened as the Apostle told them, verse. 6.
their rejoicing was not good, for that they kept the fest of their* passover
Christ, with such so w^^^even among them, whereas in the shadow thereof, the
leven of material bread was forbid to be eaten Exodus 12. 19
upon pain of cutting off from Israel. The whole Church is endangered when they
neglect this duty; first, because whiles im* penitent sinners are suffered,
their example is on evil president, and an embold^ing of others, to do
likewise: as even the hethens Esth. 1. 16. 17. 18.
could tell King Ahas^^verosh, about Queen Vashties Prove. 19. 25
offense; whereas if the scorner be smitten the foolish will beware. And God who
punishes some, for an Number. 26. 10 1 Cor. 10. 6.
example to others, would also have his church to chasten evil doers, that
Deuteronomy. 17. 13*
^^ Israel may hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously; because some will
not stick to Prove. 1. 10. 11 and 7. 10. 13. 21.
entise and persuade others unto their vices; especially Prove. 9. 14. 15. etc.
heretics, which leven men's sowles with false doctrine, entangle the weak
consciences, Act. 20. 30.
draw disciples after them* Tit. 1. 11.
subvert whole howses, and steal away the hearts of the people as 2 Samuel 1^. 6
did Absalom; such therefore a^ to be discovered and cast our, that al may know
and beware of them. Needfully then the Apostle warns to 1 Job. 12. 1^.
let no root of bitterness spring up and trouble us, least thereby many be
defiled; for de^^ flies Eccles. 10. 1.
causes to stink and patrify the orn^ment of the Ap^thecarre; scornful men (as
the proverb Prove. 2. 9. 8.
says*) bring the city into a snare; and Eccl. 9. 18.
one sinner destroys much good.

10. A fourth cause why the evil must be purged out of the church is to stopp
the reproaches of the world, and those without. For they take occasion by the
syns of Gods people to Titus. 2. 5. 1 Timothy 6. 1.
speak evil of them and of the truth and doctrine they profess; how much more
will and may they do this, if there be no rebuking and censuring of the sinners:
As God himself therefore has a ca^e that his name Ezekiel. 20. 9. 14. 22.
should not be polluted before the hethen, by the punishment and destruction of
us his people; so ought we again, to have our 1 Pet. 2. 12.
conversation honest among them* that God may be glorified, and his name not
Romans 2. 23. 24.
blasphemed by our transgression of his law. And such as break out unto 1
Corin. 5. 1. etc.
infamous vices, either speedily to repent and amend them, or to be cast out
from the fellowship of God and his people; so shall the throne of Christ our
king be stablished in justice, when the wicked are taken away before him, Prove.
25. ^. 5.
as when the dross is taken from the silver, there proceeds a vessel for the
finer.

11. This care of keeping the church clean and pure, the Lord has required in all ages, by many laws and rites, leading men hereunto. Himself first practiced
it, by Gen 3. 9. 10. 11. etc.
the rebuking and caling to repentance of our first parents that sinned in
paradise; and afterward by Genesis 4. 6. 7 11. 12. 14.
admonishing, and exco^municating Cain. The patriarchs Noah and Abraham, Genesis
9. 24. 25. and 21. 9. 10. 12. 14. Gal. 4. 30.
executed these judgeme^ts on their own children* when the height of their syn
so deserved* So soon as the host of Israel was constituted Number. 1. 2. 3. and 4.
chapters.
and ordered, God provided for their holiness and purity in that order wherein
he had set them, by causing al sorts of evil to be removed away. First he
commanded that such as had corporal and ceremonial pollutions, as Number. 5. verse.
2. 3.
leprosies, or yssues, or were defiled by the dead, should be put out of the
host. After that for syns and trespasses, whereby both sowl and body were in
deed defiled; he required verse. 6. 7. 8.
confession, restitutio^, and sacrifice. And lastly for the finding out and
purging of secret syn, he ordained verse. 12. 13. -- 30. 31.
that severe Law of gealousy, with the bitter curse bringing water, and
dreadful, effects of the same; by all these teaching the^ carefully to cleanse,
both themselves and the congregation; which that they might the better mind,
and observe, he afterward enacted for the lighest, even the ceremonial
uncleanness, that the man which purified not himself according unto the rites
prescribed, should be Number. 19. 20.
cut off from among the congregation, as having defiled the sanctuary of the
Lord: the like he did for all other Number. 15. 27. 30. 31.
presumptuous sinners whosoever. And these Jaws were kept in Israel, executed
2 Chronicles. 23. 19. Ezra. 6. 21.
among the people, even upon kings, who were 1 Samuel 13. 13. 14. and 15 19. 23.
26. 2 Chronicles. 26. 18 19. 20. 21.
rebuked for their syns, and thrust out for their leprosies. Christ also and
his Apostles have give^ many rules, (as is before showed) for clensing the
churches of syn.

12. The keeping of which rules, belongs to all the Saints, as the
commandment directed of old Number. 5. ^. Levit 19. 17.
to the children of Israel, and in the new testament to all the Mat. 1^. 1^ 1
Cor. 5.
brethren and church, does show. It is a duty of love, from which no Christian
can be exempted; to be performed by the word of God, which is given unto al, as
a two edged sword, to execute vengeance and rebukes, to Psalm. 149. 5. 6. 7. 8.
bind both Kings and Nobles, and execute on them the judgment written: this
honor (says David) shall be verse. 9.
to all the Saint. But chiefly this perteyneth to the ministers and watchme^ of
ye church, who having the word of reconciliation 2 Cor. 5. 19
committed unto them, and overseing the manners of Act. 20. 28
all the flock; must preach that word, 2 Timothy 4. 2
be instant in season and out of season improve, rebuke, and exhort, with all
long suffering and doctrine; they must hear ye word at Gods mouth, Ezekiel. 3. 17.
18. etc.
and give the people warning from him, admonishing them of their wicked ways,
else they shall die in their syns, and their blood shall be required at those
watchme^s hands: they Ezeeh. 44. 23.
must teach the people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause
them to discern between the unclean and the clean. These have the keys of the
kingdom of heaven, in more special manner Mat. 16. 1^. Ioh. 20. 23.
given unto them, for the binding and loosing of syns by the public ministry
of the word: they are to guide and go before the people, as in other affairs,
1 Cor. 5. 3. 1 Timothy 1. (...).
so in administering the censures of the church. By such God of old did Ier. 1.
10.
pluck up and root out, destroy and throw down, and again build and plant; by
such he Hos. 6. ^.
cut down sinners in Israel, and slew them by the words of his mouth: Unto such
the people ar to hearken, obey, Heb. 13. 17.
and submit themselves; yet also to Golos. 4. 17. Levit. 21. 8. 24.
admonish them again if need so require, and not suffer themselves to be 1
Ioh. 2. 18. 26. 27.
seduced by false doctrine, 2 Cor. 21. 20
brought into bondage, devoured or smitten on the face; but stand fast in the
faith and ^a^* 5. 1.
liberty of the Gospel, and when any is cast out from among them, or again
received in, that it be the joint actio^ of the church assembled, as Mat. 18.
17. 18. 20. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 13. 2 Cor ^. 7. 8. 10.
Christ and his Apostle have given direction.

13. Thus ar the hurts of the daughter of Gods people to be healed by
admonitions, exhortations, rebukes, denunciations, censures, and Ezekiel. 16. 23
woes; a more wholesome and pleasant balm, the^ the sweet words of the^ that cry
I^^. 6. 14.
peace peace, when there is no peace: for the blownes of the ^^^nd serves
sometimes to P^ov. 20. 30
purge the evil, and the stripes within the bowels of the be^y. By such means
the Saints ar brought to a sight of their syns, which they do away with Judge.
2 4. 5.
tears and sacrifice; they Ier. ^6. ^8. ^9.
fear the Lord and pray before him, and he repents of the plague pronounced
against them. Therefore ought al Gods servants, to love his rebukes and
censures, sent by the hands of their brethren; to P^ov. 19. (...)*
hear counsel and receiv instruction, that they may be wise in their later end:
to be more careful to bury the doung and syn of their sowles, in the grave of
Christ by repentance, the^ ye Israelits in their ca^p to Deuteronomy. ^3. 13 14.
cover their excrements, for offending the Lord: to judge themselves Ezekiel. 36.
38*
worthy to have bee^ destroyed for their iniquities, and to cry with the Leper,
Lev. 13. 45.
I am unclean I am unclean: to Iam. 5. 16.
acknowledge their faults one to another and pray one for another that they may
be healed; for mercy is Prove. 28. 13.
promised to them that confess and forsake their syns, and is to be 1 Samuel 12.
20 22. 2 Samuel 12* 13.
pronounced unto them in the name of the Lord; they are to be 2 Cor. 2. 7.
forgiven of their brethren and comforted, least they be swallowed up with
overmuch heavines. Thus the ear Prove. 1^. 3^.
that hearkneth to the correction of life, shall lodge among the wise: but he
that Pro. 29. 1.
hardneth his neck when he is rebuked, shall suddenly be destroyed and cannot
be cured. Such therefore must more roughly be entreated, and Ier. 26. 4 5. 6.
judgments denounced against them; and if they convert not, as in their Prove.
29. 6.
tra^sgression is their snare, and they are holden Prove. 5. 22.
with the cords of their own syn; so must they also by their brethren Mat. 18.
18.
be bound, and their syns John. 20. 23.
retained; and God in heaven will confirm this censure against them. Then are
they till they repent and humble themselves; 1 Cor. 5. 13. Ezra. 10. 8.
put away and separated from among God^ people, Rev. 22. 15.
excluded the heavenly Jerusalem, regarded as strangers from the common wealth
of Israel, as Mat. 18. 17.
hethens and publicans; and for despising correction, are almost brought Prove.
5. 12. 14.
into al evil, in the midds of the congregation and assembly. And if they
co^tinew still to hate correction, they Prove. 15. ^0.
shall die, such judgments* has the Lord appointed for Pro. 19. 29.
scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. By this means the body of
Christ is disburdened of noysom rotten members, the Ioh. 15. ^.
fruitless branches are taken away from the vine; the woman Zach. 5. 8. 11.
wickedness pressed down in her bushel, is lifted up and carried away from
Jerusalem to Babylon in the land of Shinar, her own proper place; the old leven
being purged out, the congregation jointly is a sweet and 1 Cor 5. 7.
new lump, as the members severally ar vnlevened; and keep a holy and joyful
feast unto the Lord; who now is turned Josh. 7. 26. 11. 12.
from his fierce wrath which was kindled for the transgressors. Then he that is
left in Sion, and remains in Jerusalem, may be caled holy, every one written
unto life in Jerusalem, Isa. 4. 3. 4.
when the Lord has washed the filthiness of the daughters of Sion, and purged
the blood of ^e, rusalem out of the midds thereof, by the spirit of judgment,
and by the spirit of burning.

The ways of the Lord ar righteo^^, and the (...) shall walk in them; but the
wicked shall f^l ther^n.

Hos. 14 10. CHAPTER XXIII.
How far the Saints may hold and walk in communion together, if offenses be
not removed.

IT falls often out, through the default and neglect of churches, that the
foresaid law and power of Christ is not duly practiced, but sinners suffered and
wincked at, yea sometimes justified and vpheld* by reason whereof, al kind of
iniquity wexeth and abounds, to the dishonor of God, the reproach and grief
of men. The duties therefore of the Saints, what then they are to do
themselves, and what to bear in others, is needful to be considered: for their
covenant with the church, persuades them Ephe. 4. 3.
to peace and concord, and not to schism or rent away from the fellowship;
again their covenant with God, binds the^ to the obedience and keeping of
Deuteronomy 8. ^. Ephesians. 5. 7. 11 Prove. 4. 26. 27.
al his commandments, with reproof of, and departure from al evil.

2. In this straight, regard is to be given, first unto the cause and thing it
self, which is done or suffered amiss; secondly unto the handling thereof, and
dealing about the same. For the cause it self, that in questions and disputable
controversies the Saints bear one with another Romans 14. 1. 2. etc. and 15 1.
Philip. 3. 15.
infirmities and diversity of judgment, especially for the present, til the
truth be tried out, either among themselves, or by the help of other churches;
which was the practice Act 15. 1. 2. etc.
in the Apostles days; as also in Moses law, for hard and doubtful matters,
the people dispersed through their cities and tribes had Deuteronomy. 17. 8 9. 2 Chronicles. 19. 8.
aid of the Senate in Jerusalem. In this case therefore al Christians should
mind yt counsel of Gods wisdom, Romans 12. 16
not to be wise in themselves; Philip, 3. 15
if they be otherwise minded, God shall revele even the same unto them, they
know not perfectly 1 Cor. 13. 9 10.
but in part. Or if it be a personal controyersie, that as much as they may,
they fulfill Christ's law to Gal. 6. 2.
bear their brothers burden, and procure their own glory, Prove. 19. 11
bypassing by an offense: rather to ^ Cor, 6. 7.
suffer wrong and susteyn harm, then by strife and contention to cause reproach;
remembering his counsel which said, Eccles. 7. 1^*
be not just overmuch. But if the doctrine be 1. Tim. 1. 3. 4. and 4. 1. 2.
etc. Tit. ^. 9 10. Jude. 3.
erroneous, and pernicious for the infecting of men's sowles, and withdrawing
them from the faith; if the practice be 1 Cor. 5. Col. 2. 18. 1 Cor. 10 6. ^ 8.
14.
wicked, superstitious, or idolatrous, violating Gods covenant, injuring their
brethren, or defiling themselves, to the slander of the Gospel; then all the
Saints must neither suffer (so far as is in their power,) nor partake at al in
any such evil. Yet before they make any breach or departure from the Church,
they are to use al means Heb. 12. 14 Philip. 2. 3. 1 Cor. 16. 14 and 14. 40.
in holy, meek, peaceable, and orderly manner, for their redress, as is Chap.
22.
before showed.

3. That transgressions may not be suffered in churches, the reasons in the
former chapter alleged, do prove; and may further be confirmed by the reproof
that Christ sent to the Angels and Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira, for Rev.
^. 14. ^5. 20.
having and suffering false teachers among the^, yt drew the people into syn; of
this fault they were willed to verse. 16.
repent, or else he would fight against them with the sword of his mouth; and
verse. 23.
kill their children with death. And such as had kept themselves from these
corruptions, were verse. 24. 25 26.
willed to hold first that which they had, unto the end* On the other hand, he
p^^vs^d ye Ephesians, that they could not verse. 2.
bear with the^ which were evil, but had tried and found out false Apostles. And
this m^rke Solomon set on them that keep the law, that Prove. 28. 4
they will set themselves against the wicked.

4. And that the Saints may not for fellowship with the church or any members
thereof, do any evil thing, either in Gods worship or th'affayres of man; the
very form of the law given to them* al jon^y and severally shows; for God
speaks to every sowl apart, Exodus 20.
Thou shall have no other Gods before my face; and ^o in all the other precepts.
And least by the error of many, any should be withdrawn from this obedience;
he gav another express law, Exodus 23. ^.
Then shall not follow a multitude to do evil. After that, when corruption
spread among the people, he said Hos. 4. 15.
though thou Israel play the harlot, yet let not Judah syn. And so far ought
al to be from synning for company, as they should say with ^aak^b, Genesis 49. ^.
into their secret let not my sowl ^^me; my glory be not thou joined with their
assembly; and with David should Psalm. 26. ^. 6.
hate the assembly of the evil, and not s^t with the wicked, but wash their
hands in innocence, and compass the Lords altar; for howsoever men join
together in syn, yet ^^and in band Prove. 11. 2^*
the wicked shall not be unpunished; the sowl that synneth Ezekiel. 18. 4.
it shall die; and whither it be Deuteronomy. 29. 18 19. 20.
(...) or woman or family or tribe, whi(...) shall turn their heart away from
th(...) Lord, and so persist, blessing th(...) selves in their evil; he will
not be merciful to such a person, but p(...) out his name from under heaven.
A(...) the Lord when he takes his (...) the hand, teaches them Isa. 8. 11. 13
(...) walk in the way of such people, b(...) to sanctify and fear him. This
then is the duty of every sowl, that they keep themselves pure, and refrayn
from al wickedness, that so the praise of Judah may come upon them, which ^os.
11. 12.
yet ^^led with God ^ was faithful with the Saints, when Ephraim compassed the
Lord with lies, ^ the house of Israel with deceyt. So also shall their reward
be with those Rev. 3. 1. ^*
few names in Sardi (which church had a name that it lived, but was dead,)
which had not defiled their garments, and should walk with Christ in whites,
for they were worthy.

5. Moreover the Saints must have a care of their communion in the church, that
by reason of their brotherhood and corporation, they 1 Timothy 5. 2^.
partake not with other men's syns. True it is, that some hypocrites will carry
them selves so cunningly, that they can hardly be discovered or avoided,
howsoever in godly gealousie they may be suspected; such must be born with
patience, til their sins be ripe. And it appears, that the Apostles
themselves were much troubled with such, whom they theifore caled 2 Cor. 11.
13. 14. 15.
deceiptful workers, for that they could, (like Satan) transform themselves
into the Apostles of Christ, and ministers of righteousness; and these sought
verse. 12.
occasion against the faithful servants of God, and would impurely, Philip. 1.
15 16.
even of envy and strife; preach Christ, supposing to add more affliction to
their band^ neither has the church in any age been without such tares; whose
judgment is with the Lord not far off, and their damnation sleeps not. But
if their wickedness be apparent, they must either be reclaymed from their syn,
or rejected: otherwise the whole church may be 1 Cor. 5. 6.
levened, and in fault also, as before is proved. And when either in Gods
worship, corruptions ar admitted; or the open wicked suffered vnamended: all the
godly ought not only to reprove and witness against these evils, but refrayn
from partaking with the church in them. So did the prophets, and holy men of
old themselves; and so they taught others. When false worship was set up in the
churches, they warned the people Hos. 4. 15.
not to come there; when false prophets taught, Ier. 23. 16.
not to hear them; yea though they were their own children, Zech. 13. ^.
to thrust them through when they prophesied. And generally for all iniquity
against God and men, they taught every one Ezekiel 18. 10 11. 12. 13. 20.
to refrayn as they loved their lives and salvation; to Verse. 30. 31.
turn themselves, and cause others to turn from al their transgressions;
because they should be judged every one according to his ways. Hereupon the
godly when they could not reclaim their brethren, both Ezekiel. 9. 4.
mourned and cried for all the abominations done among them, and also Isa. 59.
15.
refreyned from evil, whereby they made themselves a prey to the wicked; who
Isa. 66. 5.
hated them and cast them out for Gods name sake; yet they again were taught to
Ezekiel. 23. 45
judge them after the manner of harlots; to Hos. 2. 2. 30 4.
plead with their mother (the Church) that she was not the wife of the Lord,
nor he her husband, but for her adulteries she should be slain, and her
children vnpittied, if she took not away her fornications out of her sight. And
in Ieremies days the Lord asks Ior. 11. 15.
what his beloved should tarry in his house, seeing it had committed abomination
with many? and the holy flesh, (that is the flesh Hag. 2. 13. 14. 15.
of the sacrifices,) was gone away from them, (being defiled by there impure
actions, and therefore rather to be Lev. 7. 19.
burnt with fire then eaten of any man;) for when they did evil, they rejoiced;
so that it were better for every Godly one to separate, then communicate with
that worship, where (as another Isa. 66. 3.
Prophet says,) the sacrificing of bulloks and sheep, was as if they had slain
a man, or cut off a dogs neck, or offered swines blood, and the memory of
incense, as if they blessed an Idol; they having chosen their own ways, and
their sowl delighting in their abominations. In like manner did Christ inform
his Apostles, and they the churches; that they should not admit of any
erroneous doctrines, or partake in any evil act with the Scribes and
Pharisees, but Mat. 15. 1^.
let them alone like blind guides, and Act. 2. 40.
save themselves from that froward generation; to Ephesians. 5. 7.
have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; to 1 Timothy 6. 5. 2 Timothy 3. 5.
separate, and turn away from false teachers, and evil doers; to 1 John. 4. 1.
try the spirits, and having tried al things, to keep only 1 These. 5. 3^
that which was good; to refuse all fellowship with false teachers, 2 John. 10.
not to receiv them to house, nor bid them God speed; to hold such accursed as
should preach Gal. 1. 8. 9.
otherwise then they had received of the Apostles; And generally not to Rev.
18. 4.
partake in the synns of others, that they receyved not of their plagues.

6. By which and many other like scriptures, we are taught, not to keep
communion with people or church, in any open or known wickedness, against
either table of Gods law; for that were to honor man morethen God. Our
fellowship is in the 1 Ioh. 1. 6. 7
light, not in darkness; neither is it good walking to speak against faults in
others, and our selves Psalm. 50. 16. 17. 18.
do the same with the^ how should our reproofs or admonitions be regarded of
men, when the Mat. 7. 3. 4
beam is in our own eye, and our works do Tit. 1. 16.
more justify, then our words can condemn them? The prophets of old, our
savior, and his Apostles, ar never found either to do, or ioyn in the doing
of any unlawful thing, for which they blamed their peoples: in like weise must
we walk; else shall we be inexcusable before God and men; for (as itis written,)
Romans 2. 1.
he that judges another and does the same things, condemns himself.

7. And in our assemblies where Gods Psalm. 19. 7.
presence is, ought our holiness, fear, and obedience, most to shine; and al
evil things most be shunned: where by reason of our near co^junction, and
communion, the co^tagion of syn may spread over al. For there all ar one loaf,
and one body, 1 Cor. 10. 17
because we are al partakers of one bread. And if the wicked partake with us,
neither we nor the holy things can sanctify the^; but contrariwise they defile
us and every thing they touch, as the law says Number. 19. 22.
whatsoever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and the person that
touches him, shall be unclean. And this touching, figured our fellowship
together in the Church, as the Apostle 2 Cor. 6. 14 15. 16. 17.
shows; and by this, the prophet Haggai convinced the people of Israel to be
Hag. 2. 14. 15.
unclean in Gods sight, they and al their works and sacrifices. Wherefore
straight Levit. 22.
laws were given to that nation, as well priests as people, eve^ upon pain of
verse. (...)*
death, that none in his uncleanness should Levit. 22 3.
touch the holy things of the church, for that was not only a defiling of the
verse. 15.
things themselves, but of Gods verse. 2, and. 52.
name also. For avoiding whereof, the Priests were to Ezekiel. 44. 23
teach the people how to discern between holy and profane, clean and unclean
Which if they did, and took away the precious from the vile, then were they as
Ier. 15. 19.
Gods mouth: otherwise, when they put no difference between holy and profane,
they Ezekiel. 22. 26
broke Gods law, and defiled his holy things; for which cause, he powered out
verse. 31.
his indignation upon them. And now that al Christians ar made Rev. 1. 6.
Priests unto God, even a 2 Pet. 2. 9.
kingly priesthood to Rev. 5. 10.
reign upon earth, and have the 1 Cor. 5. 4.
power of Christ, to judge all that are verse 12.
within the church, and verse. 13.
cast out the wicked from among them: they ought to 1 Cor. 7. 23. ^ 5. 1.
reteyn and use their power, to execute the Psalm. 149. 9.
judgment that is written; and as the priests of old, to Ezekiel. 44. 24.
keep Gods laws and statutes in all his assemblies, or else to Isa 52. 11.
depart from among them.

8. For if any church or people, violate Gods covenant, by synning against him,
and one against another: and if their ears Ier. 6. 10.
be uncircumcised that they cannot harken to admonition, nor be verse. 15.
ashamed when they have committed abomination; but despising the word, walk
stubbornly with God, and will not be reclaymed: the^ they that were Mic. 2. 8.
yesterday Gods people, ar risen up for an enemy, and he will walk Levit. 26. 28
stubbornly in anger against the^, and his verse. 30

incense of their prayers is Isa. 1. 13. Prove. 15. 8.

his kingdom from them, and give it to a nation which shall bring forth the
fruits thereof, and their Mat. 23. 38.
habitation shall be left unto them desolate. He will do unto them as he
threatens by his prophet, Hos. 9. 15.
For the wickedness of their inventions I will cast them ou^ of my honse, I will
love them no more; and again verse, 17.
my God will cast them away because they did not obey him. For ^ Sam. 15. 23
rebellion is as the syn of witch craft, and transgression is wickedness and
idolatry; seeing they have cast away the word of the Lord, therefore he casts
away the^; the curse is Da^. 9. 11.
powered upon them, and the oath that is written in the Law. For God proclaymeth,
I^r. 11. 3. 4.
Cursed be the man, that obeys not the words of this covenant, which I
commanded your fathers, saying, obey my voice, and do according to all these
things which I command you, so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
And his servants answer and say, verse. 5.
Amen o Lord. Thus the curse devoureth the land, of that Assembly or people,
and the inhabitants thereof ar desolate, for that Isa. 24. 5. 6.
they tra^sgressed ye laws, changed the ordinances, and brake the everlasting
covenant; and then the Lord swears and says, Amos. 6. 8.
I abhor the excellency of Iaakob, and hate his palaces.

9. Then they, that cried out against their abominations, ar Ezekiel. 9. 4. 6
marked and saved from destruction; a book of Mal 3. 16.
remembrance, is written before the Lord, for them that fear him, and think on
his name, and they shall be unto him verse. 17.
for a flock, and he will spare them as a man spares his own son that serves
him; they Mal. 3. 18.
shall discern between the righteou^ and the wicked; unto them shall Mal. 4. 2.
the sun of righteousness arise, with health under his wings, and they shall
Ger. 3.
tread down the wicked as dust under the soles of their feet. Thus the redeemer
will come Isa. 59. 20.
unto the^ that turn from iniquity in Iaakob; and he will leav in the mids of
it, an Zeph. 3. 1^. ^3.
humble and poor people, and they shall trust in his name, and the remnant of
Israel shall do no iniquity nor speak lies: And over them will the Lord Ger.
17.
rejoice with joy, he will quiet himself in his love, even with joy will he
rejoice over them.

The Lord preserves al them that love him* but he will destroy all the wicked.

Psalm. 145. 20. CHAPT. XXIIII
Of the communion that one church has with an other.

HAving spoken of the Saints communion in their several Congregations, wherein
they are distinct bodies, and owe special duty and care one toward another: it
remains that something be said, of the communion between Church and church.
For though they be disjoined in place, yet ar they united in heart and spirit;
so as they generally are but Ephe. 4. 4. 5. Colos. 1. 18
one body or church, under one head Christ, caled in one hope of their
vocation, by one God and Father of al; and must endeavor, to keep the unity of
the spirit in the bond of peace.

2. When Christ sent forth his Apostles into the world, he Not. 2^. 19. 20.
gave them one and the same commission, for preaching the Gospel in all nations,
and teaching them to observe whatsoever he had commanded: who thereupon preached
Ephe. 4. 5. Tit 1. 4.
one common faith, a covenant and Gospel Heb. 13. 20 Rev. 14. 6.
everlasting, for every tongue and people; and exhorted them Jude. verse. 3
earnestly to contend for that faith once given to the Saints. And as the
faith was one, so was there one rule or Gal. 6. 16.
canon for all Gods Israel to walk by, the Act. 14. 23 and 20. 17. Iam. 5. 14. 1
Pet. 5. 1. Tit 1 5.
same officers in all churches; the same 1 Cor. 7. 17 and 16. 1. Act 16. 4.
ordinances and decrees; the same ways taught by the Apostles 1 Cor. 4. 17
every where in every Church, and al other 1 Timothy 1 3. and 6. 3. 14.
forbidden: so peace was set by God in 1 Cor. 14. 33.
al churches of the Saints.

3. And as the church generally considered is the Gal. 4. 26.
mother of all the faithful; so the particular churches ar Song. 8. 8.
sisters each to other, and there is a 1 Pet. 5. 9. (...)
brotherhood of the Saints throughout the world; they being Gal. 3. 28.
al one in Christ Jesus, the Ioh. 10. 16.
one shepherd that has made one sheepfold: and are therefore exhorted to be 1
Pet. 1. (...) with 3. 8.
al of one mind, and to lov as brethren. For so was it prophefied of the latter
days, that peoples should jointly Isa. 2. 2. 3. 4.
seek for knowledge of Gods ways, in the mountayn of his house; and nation not
lift up a sword against nation, nor learn to fight any more.

4. From hence arises, the communion of love, and al Gods graces and blessings
among the churches; wherein our elder sister, the Congregation of Israel, has
walked before us for an example. For she had mind and care of us when we were
small Song. 8. 8.
and without breasts, not able to bear or nourse up children to the Lord; she
Psalm. 67.
prayed for us unto God, Psalm. 87. 4
made mention of us to her acquaintance, and taught her children by many Genesis
9. 27. and 12. 3. Ps. 2. 8. and 72. 8 9. 10. 11. Isa. 49. 6. and 66 19. 20. 21.
Hos. 2. 23. Mal. 1. 11.
prophesies, to exspect our birth, caling, and co^joyning in one spiritual
body, faith, worship and religion. And now that we through Christ have obtained
this riches and mercy, though it be by her Romans 11. 12
fall and diminishing; we ought both to nourish unity and peace among our
selves, and to remember her again, who notwithstanding her present misery, is
verse. 28.
beloved for her fathers sakes, and shall again verse. 31.
obteyn mercy; which what will it be unto us, but verse. 15.
life from the dead?

5. Examples also we have of y^ churches in the Apostles days who communicated
each with other, in blessings spiritual and temporal, as amongst others chiefly
appears in those two loving sisters the Churches at Jerusalem and Antiochia,
the one of which were Jews, the other Gentiles. For they Act. 11. ^2. etc.
in Jerusalem hearing that many in Antioch were turned unto Christ; sent for
their further edification, Bainabas unto them, Act. 11. 24.
a good man and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith; by whose means, much
people joined themselves unto the Lord. The Antiochians knowing, ( Romans 15. 27
as the Apostle says,) that if they were made partakers of their spiritual
things, their duty was to minister unto them in carnal things: when they heard
of a Act. 11. 28. 29. 30.
famine foretold to come over all the world, sent succor to their brethren in
Judea, by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. Again when there Act. 15. 8. 2. etc.
grew a dissension by means of false doctrine sown among the^; they sent the
said Paul and Barnabas for advise and help unto Jerusalem; which church after
verse. 7.
great disputation even by the Apostles themselves, verse. 22.
sent back choice and chief men of their own company, to Antiochia with Paul
and Barnabas, and wrote letters also, of the same matter; so bot^ by word and
writing, Act. 15. 30. 31. etc.
the multitude of believers there, were confirmed in the truth, and rejoiced
for the consolation.

6. Thus have we a pattern and president of Christian duties between Churches,
in that Church which first was crowned with the name of Act. 11. 26.
Christians; and have besides this, many other instructions and examples
proposed in the scriptures; as of the Churches in 2 Cor. 8. 1. ^. 3. etc.
Macedonia, so ready and instant to bestow grace and fellowship of ministering
to other Saints; of ^ Cor. 9. 1. ^. 3. etc.
Corinth also in the like case, whose readiness of mind, Paul boasted of to
other congregations, and their zele provoked many. And well was it with the
churches the^, which strove not for primacie, nor knew no preeminence one over
an other; but walked al as brethren under one (...) 1 Pet. 5. 4.
Archpastour Christ, who still Revel. 2. 1. 2. etc.
walked among the^, visiting the ways and works of those golden candlesticks,
whose lights shined not only in them selves, but unto others, so as they were 1
These. 1. 6.
followers of the Apostles and of y^ Lord, verse. 7. 8.
ensamples to their sister churches, in doctrine, faith, virtue; and 1 These. 2.
14
folowers of the^ in patience; for which the Apostles 2 These. 1, 4.
rejoiced in the churches of God. Hereupon followed 2 Cor. 9. 13. 14. 15. Romans
16. 4. 16. 1 Cor. 16. 19.
prayers one for another, thanks, and salutations, with all other means to
nourish lov, and continue peace. Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah,
which foretold Isa. 19. 23. 24.
of a path from Egypt to Asshur, (that is from one church and nation of the
Gentiles, to another,) whereby they should come and communicate together in the
worship of God, Israel also being a third with them, even a blessing in the
midds of the land, (as we have seen before Act. 11. and. 15.
in the church at Jerusalem,) and the blessing of the Lord upon it, in this
holy communion, saying, Isa. 19. 25.
Blessed be my people Egypt, and Asshur the work of my hands, and Israel mine
inheritance.

7 From these few examples, compared with the Chapt. 18. and 19.
former general duties of al Christians; may appear how churches owe help,
comfort, and refreshing one to another, as they have need and ability, and
should not one envy or vex an other, but Isa. 11. 13. 14.
as Ephraim and Judah, flee together upon the shoulders of the common enemy;
yet avoiding both ambition and confusion. For although we may advise, exhort,
warn, reprove etc, so far as Christian love and power extends: yet find we no
authority committed to one congregation over an other, for exco^municating the
same, as every church has over her own members. Christ reserveth this power in
his own hand, to Rev. 2. 5.
remove the Candlestiks out of their places, if they syn and repent not. And he
in his Epistles to the seven churches, deals Rev. 2 and 3. chapt.
with every of them severally for their own estate and faults; not imputing the
syns of one unto an other: though the admonitions given to every one, were to
be a warning to al churches, eve^ whosoever had an ear to hear. Neither may
members disorderly runn from church to church, which may work trouble and
confusion; for avoiding whereof, in the Apostles days, letters of 2 Cor. 3. ^.
3 John. 8. 9. 10. Col, 4, 10. Act. 15. 24. 25. etc.
commendation were written, for such as by occasion traveiled to other places;
that they might be esteemed and received as brethren; as on the contrary, false
teachers, heretics, excommunicats, and such like; 1 Timothy 1. 20. 2 Timothy 1. 15.
and 2. 17. and. 4. 14. 15.
be shunned and avoided.

8. As for communicating with an other church, when it lies in syn; Christians
ar to consider the rules mentioned in the former chapter. For when they may not
partake with their own congregation, unto which they are joined; neither may
they partake with an other, being in the same estate and transgression. A
Multitude Exodus 23. ^.
cannot make an evil thing good; neither can many or al churches together,
justify or make tolerable, that which Gods law condemns; for Psalm. 61. 9.
al men, though they be laid together in the balance, ar lighter then vanity
as the prophet says. It is justice (according to the true proverb) Prove. 14.
34
which exalts a nation: but syn, is the shame of peoples. As therefore when
Israel was in trespass, Hos. 4. 15.
Judah was forbidden to syn, and every godly Jew, to go to their assemblies: so
the Christians in Sardi, Rev 3. 4.
which were commended of Christ for not dofiling their garments, in the syns of
that church; could not have been blameless, if they had joined with their
sister church of Thyatira, Rev 2. 20.
where Iesabel sat as Doctresse, to teach and to deceiv Gods servants.

9. When Ezekiel. 23. 4. etc.
^holah, (the church of Samaria,) had defiled her self with the idols of
Asshur, and was therefore chastised of God; it should have been a warning to
Aholihah, (the church of Jerusalem,) not to do the like, nor partake in her
sisters evils: but when they became both after one sort, the Lords verse. 18.
heart forsook them both alike; and because Jerusalem walked in her sisters way,
verse. 31.
therefore God gave the others cup into her hand, the cup of verse. 33.
destruction and desolation. For the Lord being exceeding wroth with Israel,
and having 2 king. 17. 18. 19.
put them out of his sight, that none was left but the tribe of Judah only,
yet Judah not keeping the commandments of the Lord their God, but walking
after the fashion of Israel which they used, the Lord did therefore verse. 20.
cast off all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into
the hands of spoylers, until he had cast them out of his sight. It behooveth al
therefore to mind well their communion, both with their own and other churches;
and to nourish peace, but in holiness; to keep communion, but in light, not in
darkness; for we must all appear before 2 Cor 5. 10.
the judgment seat of Christ, where Romans 14. 12
every one of us shall give account of himself unto God, and Galat. 6. 5.
every man bear his own burden. As we have sown in this flesh, so shall we
reap; the sowl that has Ezekiel. 18. 20 24.
sinned shall die; Noah, Daniel, and Job, shall Ezekiel. 14. 13. 14. 20.
deliver neither son nor daughter, but their own sowles by their righteousness.
And whosoever overcomes, shall Rev. 21. 7.
inherit all things; and shall not be Rev. 2. 11.
hurt of the second death.

Sow to your selves in righteousness: reap after the measure of mercy.

Hos. 10. 12. The conclusion.
SEeing the^ we have received such grace from God, (so many as beleev in the
name of his son Christ,) as that we are Ezekiel. 37. 1^ John. 5. 25.

syn, and al communion with the wickedness of this world to serve the Lord in
freedom of spirit, and newnes of life; according to his word; and are
conjoined in a holy society with himself, after a wonderful and
incomprehensible manner, apprehended by faith; and one with another in the
fellowship of the Gospel; being through his mercy made a 1 Pet. 2. 9.
chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, washed from al our syns Rev. 1. 5.
in the blood of Christ, and Rev. 5. 10.
reigning with him on earth, by mortifying and subduing our earthly members;
and seeing we have in this estate, all the promises of life, blessing, and
salvation, the presence and protection of him our God, the guard and assistance
of his holy Heb. 1. 14.
Angels, and whatsoever thing is good, for our help, joy, and comfort, whiles
we live on earth* What remains the^, but that we 2 Cor. 7. 1.
purge our selves from al filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and so grow up
unto full holiness in the fear of God, making straight steps unto our seet,

of faith and of afflictions, resisting syn both in our selves and others,
nourishing mutual love and peace, and making an end of our salvation Phil. 2.
18.
in fear and trembling. That after we have ended this warfare in the flesh, and
have so fought as we win the victory, and none other get our crown; when our
sowles shall flit out of these earthly tabernacles, our bodies may sleep and
rest in their Isa. 57. 2.
beds, til our change come, and our sowles not sent to the spirits 1 Pet. 3 19.

vengeance unto them that know not God; nor obey ye Gospel of our Lord Christ;
punishing them with everlasting perdition, from his presence and from the glory

them that beleev* which al shall be where himself is, and see the blessed face of
God, and there enjoy that heavenly communion in the great assembly of al
