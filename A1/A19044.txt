LONDON, Printed for Edmund Weauer, and are to be sold at his shop at the great
North gate of Paul's Church. 1623.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable, Sir Richard Boil, Knight, Lord Boil, Baron of
Youghall, Viscount Dungaruan, Earl of Cork, and one of his Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council of the Kingdom of Ireland, etc.
PArt of every desertfull birth, (Right Honorable) in any man his Country may
challenge, his Sovereign a part, his Parents a part, and his friends another.
As I cannot be useful in every respect to each of those, so I will strive to
express at least a will, if not a perfection in ability to all. Where a
general voice warrants an approbation, there every service is a duty. The
truth of it both concerns and inuites me, out of the fame and applause of your
Nobleness, to make a particular dedication of some serious hours to your
survey, whom the world speaks both noble and learned, wherein as I have done
my best to accommodate discourse with the choicest language, so I desire that
my ambition of being known unto your Lordship may not be imputed either unto
an error of impudence, or an impudence in erring. Please you to know thus much
of me, that I am partly imboldned hereunto, by the assurance of your love and
favors to that noble Gentleman, Sir William Hull, to whom as I am tied in
double bonds of blood and friendship, so, I am so much obliged unto him, that I
cannot devise a better rent than to do you service: But chiefly the report of
your own honorable merit and just commendations, encourage me to this duty,
though otherwise unknown, not questioning but you will be pleased to take
notice of one who loves and honors virtue in all Personages for virtues sake.
Vouchsafe (Right Honorable) this poor testimony of my obseruancie, intended
only to serve you, not to instruct you, and you shall not only largely requite
my endeavors, but may also expect a more steady and particular duty from

Your Honors most ready servant, Henry Cockeram.

A Premonition from the Author to the Reader.
I Am not ignorant of the praiseworthy labors which some Scholars of
deserved memory have heretofore bestowed on the like subject that I have here
adventured on: howsoever it might therefore seem a needless task of mine, to
intrude upon a plot of study, the foundation of whose building has been
formerly leuel'd and laid, yet the Justice of defense herein is so clear, that
my endeavors may be truly termed rather a necessity of doing, than an
arrogancy in doing. For without appropriating to my own comfort any interest
of glory, the understanding Readers will not, the ignorant cannot, and the
malicious dare not, but acknowledge that what any before me in this kind have
begun, I have not only fully finished, but thoroughly perfected. To write an
Apology of justification would argue rather a distrust of my Work than a
confidence of merit: Be pleased therefore (honest and (therein) learned Reader)
to survey a short Premonition for the order of the ensuing Vocabularie. First
the method is plain and easy, being alphabeticall, by which the capacity of
the meanest may soon be enlightened. The first Book has the choicest words
themselves now in use, wherewith our language is enriched and become so
copious, to which words the common sense is annexed. The second Book contains
the vulgar words, which whenever any desirous of a more curious explanation
by a more refined and elegant speech shall look into, he shall there receive
the exact and ample word to express the same: Wherein by the way let me pray
thee to observe that I have also inserted (as occasion served) even the
mocke-words which are ridiculously used in our language, that those who desire
a generality of knowledge may not be ignorant of the sense, even of the
fustian terms, used by too many who study rather to be heard speak, than to
understand themselves. The last Book is a recital of several persons, Gods
and Goddesses, Giants and Devils, Monsters and Serpents, Birds and Beasts,
Rivers, Fishes, Herbs, Stones, Trees, and the like, to the intent that the
diligent learner may not pretend the defect of any help which may inform his
discourse or practice. I might insist upon the general use of this work,
especially for Ladies and Gentlewomen, Clerks, Merchants, young Scholars,
Strangers, Travelers, and all such as desire to know the plenty of the
English; but I am confident, that experience will be the truest Herald to
publish to the world on my behalf, how as my debt to my country is to be
challenged, so my Country shall not altogether boast of any immunity from being
indebted to my S^udies. Thus what I have done is (Reader) for thy benefit,
accept it and make use of it, so shall I find reward in my labors, and rest
thy friend,

H. C.

To his very good friend, Master Henry Cockeram, on his Vocabulary.
He whose self love, or too ambitious spirit,
Enuies or carpes at this thy Muses action,
Nere let him live, or of a Muse once merit
Regard or fame, but die in his detraction,
Irreuocably plagued with Zoilan spite,
Ere he once taste of Hellicons delight.
Could I, oh could I quintessence my skill,
Or with Elixir truly alcumize,
Knowledge with learning should instruct my quill
Effectually to praise thy Muses guise,
Re-felling all the critical disasters,
Among some captious, yet wise seeming masters,
Made by her curious eye, their own distasters.
Nicholas Smith, Eques Auratus Encomiastes Posthumus.

To my industrious friend, the Author of this English Dictionarie, Mr. HENRY
COCKRAM of EXETER.
BOrne in the West? live there? so far from Court?
From Oxford, Cambridge, London? yet report
(Now in these days of Eloquence) such change
Of words? unknown? untaught? it is new and strange.
Let Gallants therefore skip no more from hence
To Italy, France, Spain, and with expense
Waste time and fair estates, to learn new fashions
Of complementall phrases, smooth temptations
To glorious beggary: Here let them hand
This Book; here study, read, and understand:
Then shall they find variety at Home,
As curious as at Paris, or at Rome.
For my part I confess, had not thou writ,
I had not been acquainted with more wit
Than our old English taught; but now I can
Be proud to know I have a Countryman
Has strugled for a fame, and what is more,
Gained it by paths of Art, vntrod before.
The benefit is general; the crown
Of praise particular, and that's thine own.
What should I say? Thine own deserts inspire thee,
Twere base to envy, I must then admire thee.
A friend and lover of thy pains, JOHN FORD

To the Reader on this Verbal of his esteemed friend, Master Henry C^ckeram of
Exeter.
ARt hidden moulds, the Author freely sends,
His sweat of brow to public private friends,
His courtesy to labor, yours to raise,
As it deserves the countenance of praise.
Hardwords farfetch'd, made smooth, before being rough,
Claim favor for requital, that is enough.
If you betray them with a treacherous kiss,
He Will laugh in's sleeue, and at your follies hiss.
Thomas Spicer.

To the Reader on this Vocabulary of his good friend, Master Henry Cockeram of
Exeter.
IF things far fetched are dearest, most esteemed,
which by times sweatful hours have been redeemed.
Of what count's this, of which sort like was never,
Praise it of force you must, and love him ever.
The Adage is far sought, dear bought, please ladies,
You must yield to this Maxim, or prove babies.
Then give worths due, that worthinesses guise,
If not, my Motto is, you are unwise.
Bartho. Hoar.

To my very good friend, Master Cokeram, Author of this work.
TO speak good words of thee were but in part
To pay back what we owe, for thy rare Art
Has taught us all good language: a rude pile
Of barbarous sillables into a style
Gentle and smooth thou have reduced: pure gold
Thou have extracted out of worthless mould.
And that no one may think thy merit weak,
Of a rough speech thou have taught us all to speak
A perfect language; in which Cockerams praise
Shall live beloved, whilst time leaves making days.
John Day.

To his industrious friend, Master Henry Cockeram.
TO ouer-praise thy Book, in a smooth line,
(If any errour's in it) would make it mine:
Only, while Words for payment pass at Court,
And whilst loud talk and wrangling make resort
In The Term to Westminster, I do not dread
Thy leaves shall escape the Scombri, and be read.
And I will add this as thy friend, no Poet,
Thou have toild to purpose, and the event will show it.
John Webster.

To his worthily respected friend, Master Henry Cockeram.
WHo has discovered yet a nearer way,
By which, what we conceive, we can convey
To others, then by words, that full express
What Mimicke action does but only guess:
But where a language has variety,
And every word a real property,
How much it adds to elocution,
As do but read this Book, then think upon
The Authors pains and praise, give him respect
For this addition to our Dialect.
John Crugge.

Buffe, a very fierce beast, much like unto a Bull, having a very long mane.

Chamelion, the least of all beasts, which breeds eggs or spawne, it changes

the air.

Crocodile, a beast hatched of an egg, yet some of them grow to a great
bigness, as 10. 20. or 30. foot in length: it has cruel teeth and scaly
back, with very sharp claws on his feet: if it see a man afraid of him, it
will eagerly pursue him, but on the contrary, if he be assaulted he will shun
him. Having eaten the body of a man, it will weep over the head, but in fine

their houses, and kill them: he is sometime male and sometime female.

Ignarus, a small beast without a tail, having small legs, with three long
sharp claws, instead of feet, wherewith he runs up trees, and his desire
is to sit there on the tops thereof: it was never seen to feed on any thing,
and therefore is supposed to live by the air: in the night it sings six
kind of notes one after another: as, la-sol-fa-mi-re-vt: it is not above
eighteen inches in length, and is near as thick as long: his head resembles

much as it is said that it can see through a wall.

it lame in the chine, and if it bite, the beast swells to the heart and dies.

Sue, a most cruel fierce beast, carrying her young upon her back to shadow
them from the heat with her huge tail.

Tiger, a truculent beast, and the swiftest of all other beasts: wherefore they
are taken very young in the dams absence, and carried away by them on
horseback: who hearing the cry of the old Tiger following after them, do of
purpose let fall one of the whelps, that while she bears that back, they
in the mean time may escape safe with the other to the ship: but of all, the
