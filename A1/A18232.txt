Igitur fili carissime docebo te quo pacto mores

Itaque deo supplica / parents ama

Love hem well and be thou never to smerte

Take heed to thy household ay love thy wife
Pleasant words out of thy mouth should crepe

Plus vigila semper ne sompno deditus esto
Nam diuturna quies vicus alimenta ministrat

A wake my child and love no slogardye
In much slept look thou never delight
If thou purpose to worship for to stye
Long sleep and slouthe to vice done men excite
It makes men dull it mak^th hem imperfect
It fosterith up filthes of the flessh
It palleth also and wastes bloodes fressh
Virtutem primam puta esse compescere linguam
Proximus ille deo qui scit ratione tacere

Trusts well also the first of virtues allo
Is to be stylle and keep thy tongue in mewe
Of tongue untied much harm may fall
Love me well this is as the gospel true
Who that can delauyaunce of words eschew
And rest with reason this is verrey text
To god above that man is alder next
Sperne repugnando tibi tu coutrarius esse
Couneniet nulli qui secum dissidet ipse

Advise the well that thou never trauerse
Thyn own sentence for thereof sueth shame
Sey not one and often the contrary reherce
Such repugnaunce wol make thy worship lame
Where stedfastnes wol cause thy good fame
For he shall never accord with man on live
That with him self will ay repugne and strive
Si vitam inspicias ho^m si denique mores
Cum culpas alios nemo sine crimiue viuit

If thou advertise and behold about
The lives of men and manners also
Both of thy self and other the without
In myddel earth thou shall find who
That in so^me part nys to virtue foo
Blame no man therefore if ye do a right
Sith in earth lakles lives no wight
Que nocitura tenes quamuis sint cara relinque
Vtilitas opibus preponi tempore debet

If thou suppose thing that shall noye and grove
Though they be dear and right great of price
Such as suffers not thy proffyt acheue
If thou list to be rewled as the wise
Absteyne the from such thing in all wise
For it is more wysedom in sothfastnesse
To prefer prouffyt than such richesse
Constans et leuis vt res expostulat esto
Temporibus mores sapiens fine crimine mutat

It is a good lesson for the nones
A wight to be tempryd with constance
And to be glad and merry eftsoon
Not alwey sad ne light of cou^tenau^ce
A ma^nis chere may him full often auau^ce
For at each time as ye thing requires
So the wise man visageth and chereth
Nil temere vxori de seruis creed querenti
Sepe etent mulier que^ co^iunx diligit odit

Gyf no credence alwey to thy wife
That for her Ire and vnpacience
With sharper tongue than is sword or knyf
Playneth on thy servant though none offense
Thou find in him learn well this sentence
The wife wol hate and cause to smerte
Often him that her husbond loves in heart
Cumque mones aliquem nec se velit ipse moueri
Si tibi sit carus noli desistere ceptis

And if thou warn a wight of his forfete
Al though he grutcheth with frownyng countenance
And in his langage manace the and threte
Yet forbere thou not for all such dysplesaunce
To teache him to amend his governance
As thou began corecte that is a mysse
And that is a friendly tache I wysse
Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis
Sermo datur cuntis animi sapiencia paucis

Against wordy folk ay full of wind
Strive not at all it may not the profit
Such rasshe folkis ben in conceytis blind
The wytles word auaylith not a myte
In feel words is often wisedam full lyte
For unto every wight is given speech
And yet the wise full often ben to seche
Dilige sic alios vt fit tibi carus amicus
Sic bonus esto bonis ne te mala dampna sequa^tur

Love other men and have them so in chere
That to thy self thy love most extend
Look no person be to the more dear
Than thyn estate for then thou shall offend
And hurt thy self and other folk amend
But ever cherisshe other and love hem so
That to thy self thou be founden no foo
Rumores fuge ne incipias nouus auctor haberi
Nam nulli tacuisse nocet nocet esse locutum

Tidings new that fleen as the wind
Eschew my child with al thy dylygence
Be never besy new tidings to find
Such nouelte causes often offense
It is no wit it is no sapience
It hurts not a man to be in pees
But it does harm to put his tongue in prees
Rem tibi promissam certam promittere noli
Rara fides ideo qr multi multa loquntur

Make no promise of other mennys heste
Remember well that promise is unsure
But if thou keep thyn thy name sleest
To serve thy behest do thy besy cure
Trust not the word of every creature
Sum mannys feyth is esy to break
For many folks think not as they speak
Cum te aliquis laudat iudex tuu^s esse memento
Plus aliis de te qna^ tu tibi credere noli

With words fair when fauel fedith the
Be thou not blind for his false flaterye
Let thyn own reason alwey thy Judge be
And in effect if thyn astate be hye
Though fauel with his craft will blind thyn eye
In all thy life thou never gyf credence
More to thy self than to thy conscience
Officium alterius multis narrare memento
Atque alijs cum tu benefeceris ipse sileto

When thou see another man's desert
As for his good deeds commendable
In every place preuy or a pert
Such a wight with thy good word enable
And though he have been by the auaylable
Yet of thy good deed make thou no bobanuce
And than shall other men thyn name enhaunce
Multorum cum facta senex et dicta resensus
Fac tibi succurrant iuuenis que feceris ipse

And if thou live long an old man shall thou be
Age wol approach maugre who says nay
Than perseyue behold about and see
How aged folk ben tretyd with all day
And so pouruey for thy self asay
In to stoupyng age when thou art crept
Thing may the help that in thyn youth was kept
Ne cures si quis tacito sermon loquatur
Conscius ipse sibi de se putat omnia dici

Charge not al though thou see men speak soft
Ne change no chere for often it is full bet
In secret wise to s^^ke than cry on lofte
A man should see alwey where he were set
And after that so should he speak or let
But to the suspect of harm it seems
Men speak of him he none other demeth
Cum fueris felix que sunt aduersa caueto
Non eodem cursu respondent vltima primis

When fortune has yeuen the felicite
And set the on high than beware of a fall
Than sueth often such sharp aduersite
Falls fortune tourneth as does a balle
In her trust have thou no sikernes at all
Her perilous play turns whylom to grame
For the end is woo that began that game
Cum dubia et fragilis sit nobis vita tributa
In mortem alterius spem tu tibi ponere noli

Our brotel life is here so full of doubt
That in very surete no wight may stand
So suddenly crepen the sowles out
Al about this world in every land
Of young and old for every wight is bond
To death therefore set not thyn affiaunce
In death of him that may the suruyue perchance
Exiguum munus cum det tibi pauper amicus
Accipito placide plene laudare memento

A lityl yefte given with good entente
Of thy friend that lives in pouerte
With right good chere such yefte take and hente
Supposyng ay that as good will has he
And more than many men that richer be
Peyse not the yefte ne pondre not the pryse
Thentent is good and that shall the suffyse
Infantem nudum cum te natura creauit
Paupertatis onus pacienter berre memento

Since nature that is thy first norice
Has brought the hyder al nakyd and bare
Though thou never can richesse accomplice
But thou art hold alwey in pouertis snare
Yet no force make never to much care
Take patiently pouerte for the best
Riches is not of nature but of earth encrest
Ne timeas illam que vite est vltima finis
Qui mortem metuit quod viuit perdit id^^sum

Though death be the fyn of every creature
And no wight on live shall from him escape
Yet dread not death with over besy cure
To live on earth it is but a Iape
If thou shall alwey after death so gape
Thynk well to dye but modefye thy thought
Or ellis to live auaylith the right naught
Si tibi pro meritis nemo respondet amicus
Accusare deum noli sed tripse coherce

For thy desert if no friend thank the
I mean when thou have done thy force and pain
To other folks friendly for to be
If they can not gramercy to the sayn
Withdraw thyn hond and so thy self refrain
Blame not thy god for their vnfrendlynesse
But for such men do afterward the less
Ne tibi quid desit quesitis vtere parce
Vt que quod est serves semper tibi deesse putato

Since no rich man that leuyth any where
If he consume his goods al and waste
But that pouerte shall grieve sore and dear
Therefore my child such goods as thou have
Let not to sone out of thy hond beraste
Lest than thy good hereafter wol the fail
Hold that thou have it may the efte avail
Quod prestare potes ne bis pro miseris vlli
Ne sis ventosus dum vis bonus esse videri

Be^ote no man a thing to lene him twyse
And fail him onys that is but vilanye
If thou may lene do hit in friendly wise
Such cheuysaunce a friend loath to be wrye
Of thy good deeds clamor thou not ne cry
Be not wyndy ner of words breme
If a good man thou list appear and seem
Qui similat verbis nec cord est fidus amicus
Tu quoque fac simile sic ars deluditur art

And if thou find the sone of doubleness
The false dissymylour if thou espy
With peynted words and heart full of falsnesse
Thou may in no wise better blere his eye
Than to serve him with his own trecherye
With words fair and friendly to depart
Meant thou the same and art begyle by art
Noli hoi^es blando nimium sermon probare
Fistula dulce cauit volucrem dum decipit auceps

Preue thou never a man by over painted speech
For under fair words is often annexid gyle
The word is gay but frendeshyp is to seche
As it is said such craft is in this I Will
Yet so^me think ylle when they their tunges fyle
The whistelyng fouler makyth merry song
And so the birds begyleth he among
Cum tibi sint nati nee opes tunt artibus illos
Instrue quo possint mopem deffendere vitam

When so is that thou have gotten children
Look in her yongth than inform hem so
In so^me craft and mister that they may therein
Learn to get her living and to deffende also
Her life which ever needs and that they unto
Virtue may atteyne for that he no craft can
Often time nedyth and is in danger of every man
Quod vile est carum quod carum vile putato
Sic tibi nec cupidus nec auarus nosceris vlli

Have this conceyte for it is often seen
Thing dear bought full often bate of price
And things that litel of value ben
In time coming may to great derth arise
Remember well this and ay it advertise
Thus shall thou best the name of chyncherye fleme
And other men shall the no nygard deem
Que culpare soles ea tu ne feceris ipse
Turpi est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum

Advise the well let reason be thy guide
When other folks thou art about to blame
That such defaulte in the be not espied
For if it be than shall thou have the shame
A mannys honor such thing wol reclame
It is full foul when a man wol teache
If that his deeds against his words preche
Quod iustum est petito vel quod videatur honestum
Nam stultum est petere quod possit iure negari

Look thy desire be groundyd of right
And than that it never trauerse honest
For as often times as any worldly wight
Desires more than right or equity
Than may his request sone replied be
And it is cleped uycete and great folly
To ask often that right wol ay deny
Ignotum tibi tu noli preponere notis
Cognita iudicio constant incognita casu

Change not a friend that thou know of old
For any new in trust that thou shall find
A better than he but in thy hands thou hold
Him that has been to the frendely and kind
For such eschaunges ben often full blind
The seems thou know never a dele
To know a trusty friend it is casuele
Cum dubia in certis versetur vita periculis
Pro lucro tibi pone diem quicunque laboras

Since that mannys life is often full of myserie
Whilom in myrthe and after in myschyef
Now in the valey and now in the hylle on hye
Now is man pour and after by riches in relieve
The shynyng morrow has often a stormy eve
To this polecie take heed at the last end
Have lucre for thy labor or that thou wend
Vnicere cum possis interdum cede sodali
Obsequio quin dulces retinentur amici

Though thou may overcome and have the victory
Of thy friend or fellow yet ay forbere
Refrain thy self and be not haute or hye
Irous hands full evil do grieve and dear
Where easy softness friends may conquer
For by good deeds set in lowlynesse
Men ben to gyder knyt in frendlynesse
Ne dubites cum magna petas inpendere parua
Hijs etenim rebus coniungit gracia caros

The lymytour that vysiteth the wives
Is wise enough of him a man may lere
To give nedlis pynnes girdeles and knyues
The craft is good thus does the wise friar
Yeueth thing small for thing that be dear
If thou receive ever give thou sumwhat ageyn
And that wol ay norisshe love in certain
Litem infer cave cum quo tibi gracia iuncta est
Ira odium generat concordia nutrit amorem

Toil not ne strive with him that is thy friend
Bewaar of that make never thy friend thy foo
A toylous man may frendshyp break and shende
Thise baratours that been mysrewled so
Interupte hem self and wrappen in much woo
For wicked wrath engenders but hate
Where as good accord norisshe love algate
Seruoru^ ob culpam cum te dolor vrget in iram
Ipse tibi moderare tuis vt parcere possis

when thy servant thou take in defaut
Though he can not his negligence excuse
Yet in thyn ire make not to fires a saute
But with thy male talent take treuse
So shall thou find ease this fete if thou use
Reule thy passion and ay by such mesure
That thou save hem that been under thy cure
Quem superare potes interdum vince ferendo
Maxima etenim morum semper paciencia virtus

Sufferaunce does ease was said long a goo
Suffer thou and have al thyn intent
Thaugh al thou may over yet do thou not so
Conquer by sufferaunce and be pacient
But for to follow cruelte never consent
For it is clepyd a virtue with excellence
A wight to live in humble patience
Conserua pocius que su^t iam parta labor
Cum labor in dampno crescit mortalis egestas

Be not to skant nor be not to prodygal
Conserve thy things gotten with true labor
It is full fair to be called liberal
But ay eschew wast and be not surfetour
Consume not al thy tresour in one hour
When of thy labor rises none avail
Needs pouerte must the in haste assail
Dapsilis interdum notis caris et amicis
Cum fueris felix se^per tibi proximus esto

Be thou not like senola for he would ete
With every man and at his feste him feed
But never no man might taste of his mete
Nor no wight to him come but he to al men yede
Be fre of thy mete but look that largess led
The no ferther than thou may easly ateyne
Be ever thyn own friend thus caton says certain
Take heed sir and see how holsomly this clerk
Entreteth men with virtuous doctrine
The first part of this compendious work
In worship how they shall full clearly shine
Guydyng to renew straight as a line
Whose preceptis to observe if that ye list
And to his counceyl your hertes to enclyne
Right in your age full well it shall be wist
The virtuous form that men shall forth convey
Lo in this life as bridel does a best
That man do not err here in this perilous wey
Stablisshyng him as does a steadfast arest
And as siker guydes that men worthyest
Mannys leuyng here to set in governance
This sage cathon puts in remembrance
Incipit secundus liber
tElluris si forte relis cognoscere cultus
Virgilium legito quod si mage nosce laboras
Herbarum vires macer tibi carmine dicet

If thou lust my child set thy hertly decit
Of earth to know the tylthe and the culture
And if thou wolt be of knowleche parfit
Why so^me is erable and so^me eke pasture
Why so^me is fresshe like flowers of picture
I counceyl the to study sadly for a while
In the laureat poet great virgile
Si romana cupis et punica noscere bella
Lucanum queras qui martis prelia dicit

And thou have desirous fressh courage
To here of romans nobyl worthynes
How they veynquysshed them of cartage
And many other through manly prowess
Than read lucan full well can he express
Who bare him best in town and also in field
And who did merueyles under martes shylde
Si quis amare libet rel discere amare legendo
Nasonem petito sin autem cura tibi hec est

And who that lust eke of lovers for to read
And in what wist hem self for to auaunce
As in that craft naso can teache him for to speed
For so^me love song. harp / pipe / and dance
So^me in redyng and other thing of plesaunce
So^me louen covertly eke and lust not be espied
And so^me would be known thus writes ouyde
Vt sapiens viuas audi que dissere possis
Per que semotum vicijs deducitur euum

But yet my lef child if that in adventure
Thyn heart be yeuen to noon such manner thing
Or that it be not unto thy pleasure
That virgyl macer lucan / or naso does bring
Yet that thou may be wise after in thy living
If thou lust to me to give audyence
I shall show the doctrine of sapyence
Ergo ades que sit sapiencia disce legendo

Therefore my child come nere to me and lere
And I shall the show the verray tresure
Of sapyence if the list to harken and here
And eke how thou shall in good estat endure
And led thy life holy after goddis pleasure
Therefore aproche and lere this redyng
To ben a man ay virtuous of leuyng
Si potes ignotis etiam prodesse memento
Vtilius est regno meritis adquirere amicos

There is no wight that ferther may report
Of thy good deeds than the stranger may
Make him ay good chere and show him disporte
And be shall with honor utter the this no nay
For the unknown it proffyteth sumtyme tassay
Friends y now to have it is a better thing
Th^n is frendles any man to be a king
Mitte ^^cana dei celum inquirere quid sit
Cum sis mortalis que sunt mortalia cura

Of goddis mysterye ande eke of his worchyng
Make never my child to fer inquyraunce
It is folly any man to muse on such thing
Dispute thou never upon thy gods purueaunce
For all thing must be under his governance
And since thou art man clad in mortalite
Dispute thou of thing such as mortal be
Linque metum let nam stultum e^ te^pore in euum
Qui mortem metuit amitit gaudia vite

The dread of death that is inordynate
I mean to dread it ay and never to cese
Beware of that I counceyl the algate
For this is true as the gospel doutles
Who that dredeth death is alwey myrthles
When dread of death any man so agrudgeth
He wastes his time and ay his life abredgeth
Iratus de re incerta contendere noli
Impedit ira animum ne possit cernere verum

For thing that is to the uncertain
When thou art wroth look never that thou strive
But first thou ought to know the matter plain
For there is no person only on earth alive
But that he fro him self is also blyue
As besy wrath has kyndled him on fire
And than can he not deem the troth for Ire
Fac sumptu^ propere cu^ res desiderat ipsa
Dandum eteni^ e^ aliquid cu^ tempus postulat aut res

As time requires so make ay thyn expense
Mesure thyn hand eke after the prophecee
Of thing of time and also of the precence
So that thou spend no more than nedyth the
And that spend look that thyn heart be fre
A man should do cost and make his spendyng
Consyderyng the time and eke of his costis rewardyng
Quod nimium est fugito paruo gaudere memento
Tuta magis puppis modico que flumine fertur

To much is naught of any manner thing
The mean is good and most comendable
That man stands surest here in this living
With mean astate that holds him greable
Plente and pouerte to gadre be not suffrable
For than is the ship in the sea most surest
What time the flood is most demurest
Quod pudiat socios prudens celare memento
Ne plures culpant id quod tibi displicet vni

If thou know ought that may turn in to shame
Keep it secret and for no thing it bewrye
Be never to besy such thing to proclaim
Or publisshe as thou know wol reprye
Make not allo men to gauren on it and cry
Lest that men dampne the to other folks unknow
For such falls demers thou may find y now
Nolo putes prauos ^^es peccata lucrari
Temporibus peccata latent et tempore patent

If thou espy and see or perceive a forfaiture
And eke a shrewe of mysgouernaunce
Trust well that sumtyme shall come an cure
When for his deeds he shall suffer penance
A cursed deed axeth wreche and vengeance
Though wyckydnesse for the time be kept secre
Yet at last it wol dyscouered be
Corporis exigin vires contempnere noli
Consilio pollet cui vim natura negauit

Though sumtyme nature has been unkind
And geuyth a man to be of small stature
Yet remember my child and have in thy mind
That thou never dispyse that creature
For god may send him fortune and bone ure
And often they be with good counceyl alied
To whom nature has great strength denied
Quem scieris non esse parem tibi tempore cede
Victorem a victo superari sepe videmus

When thy hap is to trauerse and have a do
With him that is naught egal to thy might
Thyn vttermest power show not such unto
Lest that eftesones he have the in like plight
For it is often seen in batayl and in fight
Fortune chaungyth often within one our
And he is scomfyted that was erst victour
Aduersus notum noli contendere verbis
Lis minimis verbis interdum maxima crescit

Of brondes small be made fyres great
Withdraw the brondes the fire shall decrece
Ageyn the hyer look thou not plete
With words feel for words dyscorde thy piece
The man is wise that can of words cece
For this is as verily soth as god gaf life
That words small breden full much stryf
Quod deus intendit noli prequirere sort
Quod statuit de te sine te deliberat ipse

Dele not with magyke nor with sorcerye
In gods hand is al fortune and fate
Be not about to calke by destenye
Whether thou be myserous or fortunate
Let god alone in him is al thyn estate
For what him list of the to purpose
Withouten the he can full well dyspose
Iuuidiam nimio cultu vitare memento
Que si non ledat tamen hanc sufferre molestum

Beware ay of envy with tatches fell
Within thyn heart look ay that she ne rest
For it is one of the chyef pains of hell
When she soiourneth within a mannys breast
Than brennyth fenyx in her own nest
And than she may none other man myscheue
Yet ethna cesith not her self to grieve
Esto forti animo cum sis dampuatus inique
Nemo diu gaudet qui iudice vincit iniquo

Enforce thyn heart with manly sufferance
Though that falls Judgment ageyn the proceed
Be thou not abashed in word ne countenance
For often times the false oppressor may reule and led
The law but trust me well wythouten dread
Long to rejoice acheue he may not
Which by menes untrue his goods so gat
Nec te collandes nec te culpaueris ipse
Hoc faciunt stulti quos gloria vexat i^anis

Thy self also look thou not preyse
Nor dispreyse but let thou other men alone
Alwey after prudence thy words peise
For thyn auaunt honor shall thou get none
But have a mok as soon as thou art gone
A man to preyse him self as says the scole
Or dispreyse much is token of a fool
Litis preterite noli maledicta refer
Post inimicitias iram meminisse malouim est

Wrath of old that should be kept out of mind
Be thou not about to make it on live
But the enuyous has ay a tatche of kind
Such malice my child look thou never reuyue
For such malice of old wrath makes a strive
And who remembers old enemyte
A wicked man forsothe is he
Vtere quesitis modice cum sumptus habundat
Labitur exiguo quod partum est tempore longo

When it is time of cost and great expense
Bewaar of waste and spend ay by mesure
Who that to keep or spend has no difference
Makes his goods may not long endure
For the old proverb says mesure is tresure
Remember that sone thy goods may slip a way
That before were gotten in many a sundry day
Incipiens esto cum tempus postulat aut res
Stulticiam similare loco prudencia su^ma est

It is no wysdom a man alwey to be sage
But sometime to be nyce and feyn folly
Who that has this fete shall find avauntage
When time and thing desires that espy
And than dyssymyle that is great polecie
For sumtyme to be unwise by appearance
Among the wise is clepyd hye prudence
Luxuriam fugito simul et vitare memento
Crimen auaricie nam sunt contraria fame

The fylthy flessh meuyng the bestyal
That fyghteth ay ageyn the soul within
By force of her attise^ent liberal
Eschew my child and keep the from her gynne
That art and grace ben set full fer a twyn
And eschew ay of avarice the wicked fame
Thise two they ben that causen evil name
Noli tu quedam referenti credere semper
Exigua e^ tribuenda fides q^ multi multa loquntut

Believe thou not lightly in every wyghtis saw
For so^me reporten thing al other wise
Than it was ever thought or don or saw
And so^me have it also of custume and of guyse
To feed folly with flateryng and lies
Therefore give little trust to such feyr spekyng
For many folks speak untrue thing
Quod potu peccas ignoscere tu tibi noli
Nam nullum crimen vini set culpa libentis

If thou surfete in drynk forgete thou not that
Auyse the well efte thou come not in that snare
Withdraw thyn hand feed not thy throat to fat
Drink that suffyseth the and else look thou spare
To much drink makyth men of wit full bare
And yet the wyn thereof is not to blame
To blame is the drynker that makyth him lame
Concilium archanum tacito commit sodali
Corporis auxilium medico commit fideli

To thy trusty friend that is secret to the
Show thy counceyl and thy need bewrye
For a trusty friend is the chest of pryuyte
But it is great hap such friends to espy
Try out one among al a company
And of thy body betake thou all the cure
Unto such a leche that is trusty and sure
Successus indignos noli tu far moleste
Indulget fortuna malis vt ledere possit

Prospice qui veniunt hos casus esse ferendos
Nam leuius ledit quicquid preuidimus ante

In thyn own self compass about ay before
Thing to perceive that after wol fall

Where a man prudently can have a fore sight
Rebus in aduersis animum submittere noli
Spem retinere spes vna animum non morte reliquet

When diverse things trauerse thyn intent
And thou art wrapped in aduersite
For wanhope look thou be not lost ne shent
Let never dyspayr thy wit bereue the
But abide the time that better shall be
Hope is she that shall make the a seth
Hope leueth not a man till man leave the breath
Rem tibi quam noscis aptam dimittere noli
Front capillata post hec occasio calua

When men profre than is time to reteyne
Take ay thing while they ben in season
Many profre now that after wol refreyne
For that is plente now wol afterward be geson
Therefore take ay in time for so counceyleth reason
For the ^^lled (...) was sumtyme full of herys
Which is now (...) without r^su^ or sherys

Forcior vt valeas interdum parcior esto
Pauca voluptati debentur plura saluti

It is a tatche of a deuouryng hand
To receive superfluyte and do eke excess

Content thy nature and fle ay from gredynesse

Feed not thy lust with all that she wol crave
If that in health the list thy life to have
Sic tibi precipue quod primum est cura salutis
Tempora ne culpes cum sint tibi causa doloris

Take good head eke of thyn own astate
To rewle thy body well with good dyete

Sompnia ne cures nam meus humana quoth optat
Dum vigilat sperat per sompnum cernit idipsu^

Dread thou no dremes so seyth deutronomye
For often they be caused of diverse complexion
So^me of ymagynacions and many a nyce fantasy
Or ellis of blood or of superflue replexion
For dremes ben often deceit and falls illusion
When they be wakyng they desire and think
Upon that thing they dreme when they wynke
Iudicium populi nunquam contempseris vnus
Ne nulli placeas dum vis contempnere multos

Such doctrine in thyn heart to bear awey and lere
As to thy self here after shall be leef and dear
Instrue preceptis animum ne discere cesses
Nam sine doctrina vita est quasi mortis ymago

Mannys soul resembles a new plain table
In which yet appears to sight no picture
The philosophre says wythouten fable
Right so is mannys soul but a dedly figure
Unto the time she be reclamed with the lure
Of doctrine and so get her a good habyt
To be expert in cunnyng science and proffyt
Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis
Vt possis animo quemuis sufferre laborem

Who that lakketh rest may no while endure
Therefore among take ease and dysporte
Delight the never in great business and cure
But that whilom thou may also resort

Arbitrij nostri non e^ quod quisque loquatur

If thou live Justly ay keep up right
Never declynyng for mede lucre dread or favor
Treuly than stand thou in a full holsom plight

But do yet well though they myssey or lie
Productus testis saluo tamen ante pudore
Quantumcunqr potes scelato crimen amici

Sone if thou be called the soth to testefye

Betwyx folks is frendshyp in assistence
Sermones blandos blesosque cauere memento
Simplicitas viri fama est fraus ficta loquendi

Make besy watch keep well thy soul algate
Behold wisely about and spy thy covert train
When that falls fauel knokketh at thy yate

With the oil of plesaunce in full great foyson
But yet under that keep the well from this poison
Segniciem fugito que vite ignauia fertur
Nam cu^ ai^mus languet consumit inercia corpus

Sloth slogardye and dull ydelnesse
And lachesse that causith to be negligent
Enforce the ay to eschew with al thy business
For ydel soul makyth thy body shent
Treuly there is in earth no gretter argument
For to conclude thy mortal body unapt
Than the soul in ydelnes to be wrapte
Comoda multa feras sinautem spreueris illud
Non me scriptorem sed te neglexeris ipse

Enprynte my techyng in thy soul steadfast
And full proffytable thou shall it find
Forsake it not ner fro thyn heart it cast
For if that thou exclude out of thy mind
This lesson thou art full bareyn and blind
From virtues and therefore wit not me
Sithen the defaulte my sone is than in the
Alterius dictum aut factu^ ne carpseris vnquam
Exemplo simili ne te derideat alter

It is full hard to please every wight
Displese the of no manner deeds ner them lak
Nor their words neither for even so right
As thou displesed them behind thy bak
Right so wol men make the a mok and a knak
For the contrary though men had it sworn
The scorner shall be guerdoned ay with scorn
Quod tibi sors dederit tabulis supprema notato
Augendo serua ne sis quem fama sequatur

When thy last sort that men callen fate
Is good and plesaunt after thyn intent
This mean I lo when thou art fortunate
Record al thy goods that god has the sent
And suffer hem not reklesly to be spent
For than of a wastour thou shall have the name
For great riot wol cause thy feeble fame
Cum tibi di^^ie superant in fine senecte
Munificus facito viuas non parcus amicis

In to great age what time that thou art crept
And have richesse prosperity and great habundaunce
Be liberal tha^ of the goods that before thou have kept
Thenke well thou have ynogh and suffisaunce
Let never thy good of the have governance
But govern and depart it ay with thy friend
For when thou ghost hens it may not with the wend
Vtile consilium dominus ne despice serui
Nullius sensu^ si prodest contempseris vnquam

Grace is yeuen to man in many sundry wise
So^me have wysedam and so^me have eloquence
The pour folks also so^me time be full wise
A servant sumtyme may be eke of great sapyence
Though al he be had in litel reverence
Reward his wit if it be worth the while
For virtue is hyd under many an habit vile
Rebus et in sensu si non est quod fuit ante
Fac viuas contentus co quod tempora prebent

This worlds welthe ebbyng and flowyng ay
At no certain is like as wankle apryle
Though thou have loss thou shall not the dysmay

So^me man there is that has neither cross ne pyle
Now in his ward and yet right good adventure
Is him full nygh no man may know his ure
Vxorem fuge ne ducas sub noi^e doctis
Nec retinere velis si cepit esse molesta

Wedde not a wife for her enheritaunce
For she wol cast it often in thy berd
And if she be noyaunt and full of greuaunce
Constreyne her never to abide in thy yerd
Of chastysement it is a cursid swerd
To keep such one that wol ay a twyte
For he is at ease that of such oon is quyte
Multorum disce exemplo que facta sequaris
Que fugias vita nobis est aliena magistra

Of other men thou shall thy myrrour make
Confourme the to that / that most men appreue
What thou shall do and what thou shall forsake
A better fete may thou not contreue
Than to other mennys deeds releue
In all that perteyneth to thy techyng
Make of other men a reule of thy leuyng
Quod potes id tempta operis ne pondere pressus
Succu^bat labor et frustra temptata relinquas

Attempt no thing that surmounteth thy might
Ner that to finysshe thou may not acheue
For than stand thou foul in thyn own fight
Over his power what man that lusts meue
With shame his work must needs take leave
It is folly a man such works to begin
Which to perform his power is to thynne
Quod nosci factum non recte noli silere
Ne videare malos imitare velle tacendo

Law presumes that what man kepyth stylle
The crime of oon that has done great offense
And dyscoueryd hit not he is than ille
As the crymynous for keeping of his scilence
Therefore my sone bring it in to audyence
That thou perceyuest not well don is
Lest for silence men deem of the amys
Iudicis auxilium sub iniqua lege rogato
Ipse etenim leges cupiunt vt iure regantur

When the law is streyt and rigorous
Entrete ay the Judge to do the favor
Enclynyng him for to be gracious
For an egal Judge may thy cause ay socour
And yet the law shall be his governor

As in cas he may a point espy
Quod merito pateris pacienter far memento
Cunque reus tibi sis ipsu^ te iudice dampna

What pain thou suffrest for thy desert
Receive it ay well in gree and patience
Al though thy trespass be preuy and covert
Yet when thou weyes it in thyn aduertence

Demyng thy self in thyn own Judgment
Multa legas facito parlectis parlege multa
Nam miranda canunt sed non credenda poet

Myspende thou no time never for lachesse
But whylom read in books old and wise
Read and report eke with great attentyfnesse
By redyng to cu^nyng a man may rise
Than read my sone and cu^nyng accomplise
These poets written thing of great marvel
And eke of small credence often this is no fail
Inter conuiuas fac sis sermon modestus
Ne dicare loquax dum vis vrbanus haberi

Evermore among friends sittyng at feste
Be thou curteys and demeure of thy langage
Who that speaks most is not counted wysest
For of flessh and bone nature has made a cage
The tongue to keep that she be not outrage
Than if thou will be preferred of nature
Refrain thy tongue with al thy besy cure
Coniugis irate noli tu verba timere
Nam lacrimas struit insidias dum femina plorat

So^me women wepen of pure feminite
When otherwise they can not their intent
Acheue but yet beware of such nyce pity
Thy manly reason for that be not blent
For such weeping thy heart ought never relent
So^me wo^men of kind be ever weeping
And under that they can both prik and stynge
Vtere quesitis sed ne videaris abute
Qui sua consumunt cu^ deest aliena sequntur

When thou have gotten to thy worship use
What avails richesse without honor
To spend ay good and worship to refuse
Is no point of proffyt nor of socour
Therefore that thou have gotten with true labor
Consume not in mysuse lest thou do a mys
Often he nedyth of other that wasted has his
Fac tibi pro penis mortem non esse timendam
Que bona si non est finis tamen illa ^^norum

Enprynte my child ay hertly in thy mind
That thou be not of death so sore a drad
Which shall the from wretchedness unbind
Where in thy life so long thou have forth lad
A life perauenture to god and man full bad
The which though she be not to al proffytable
Ye^ she makes an end both of bad and able
Vxoris linguam si frugi est far memento
Namque malum nil velle pati nec posse taceri

Thy wives words thou suffer and take in g^^
When it avails for betyde it may
Full often that of great prudence is she
And most to be allowed this is no nay
Suffer her than and her conceyt assay
For it is hard when thou can not be stylle
Ner yet to suffer her thou can eke have will
Dilige non egra caros pietate parents
Nec matrem offendas dum vis bonus esse parenti

Goods that been yeuen the of nature
They come to the of thy progenytours
Therefore my child with al thy force and cure
Look thou love hem and cherisshe at al houris
Fer they fostrid the and kept in youth from shouris
Thy mother my dear child yet in especial
If thou do well never offend at al
Resort resort and hyderward the releue
My master now here is an wholesome air
For your avail to this place retreue
Where as for moralite spryngyng flowers feyre
And sote full plesantly do they repeyre
Gadre of hem and make a chaplet or a gay
And rest thou a while right in this herbere
Behold well and see what thing is to your pay
Incipit liber quartus
sEcuram quicu^que cupis deducere vitam
Nec vicijs herere ai^m que moribus obsu^t

What wight that list to live in sykernesse
His life and his soul to keep froth encumbrau^ce
Of vices the which and good thewes express
Be ay at stryf come nere and give attendaunce
Thise preceptis keep well in remembrance
Enrollyng hem and pryutyng in your mind
And so to live the menes shall ye find
Despice diuicias si nis animo esse beatus
Quas qui suscipiunt mendicant semper auari

The foul talent of riches my child eschew
And resemble thou never gredy tantalus
Whose etik in hunger is alwey new
Among the feyr apples delicious
No water sweet quenchith his thrust. right thus
To vilayns swalowe of couetyse
Loo all this world naught can ner suffyse
Comoda nature nullo tibi tempore deerunt
Si contentus es fueris quod postulat vsus

With reasonable fedyng be thou content
As in diete a man should never over charge
Him self for with surfeit many men ben shent
For their receytis ben to great and large
Men seen al day that litel bote or barge
Wol drenche anon when it is over freyght
Cherisshe ever nature with none over weight
Cum sis incautus nec rem racione gubernas
Noli fortunam que non est dicere cecam

If thy thing the hap to mysgouerne
Without reason or any prouydence
Than mine own child of me this lesson learn
Say not it was by fortune such expense
To make but wit it thyn own negligence
For fortune may never compelle the
Thy good to spend but at thy liberte
Dilige denarium sed parce dilige formam
Quam nemo sanctus nec honestus captat habere

Love thou the penny as for thy cheuesaunce
Not for the quoyne to horde it upon hepe
For of the prince was made the ordonaunce
Not for in cofres it should be stylle and sleep
But that it should ay shere among the people and lepe
In their eschaunge and who that kepyth hit Inn
As for the form is ay subget to sin
Cum fueris locuples corpus curare memento
Eger dives habet nu^mos sed non habet ipsum

When thou have plente and art pecunyal
I mean when thou have great suffysaunce
Of money foyson and help but small
Than spend thy money and thy self auaunce
Keep never the coin and live in greuaunce
The sike has silver and full great excess
But of him self he has no sikernesse
Verba cum tuleris discens aliquando magistri
Fer patris imperium cu^ verbis exit in iram

Though sumtyme thou suffer the great sharpnes
Of betynge yet ay thy masters chastisement
Take well in gre with humble lowlines
Since it is done but al in good entente
In cause to learn and wysedom for to hent
Al though his words sown full of Ire
Yet suffer thou the talent of that fire
Res age que prosu^t rursus vitare memento
In quibus error inest nec spes est certa laboris

Also my child thou shall the ay ocupye
To work things that been proffytable
But look thou never thy wits apply
To things that may not be auaylable
To keep a thing that is not proffytable
By wit or strength it is great error
Dispayrid hope is the end of such labor
Quod donare potes gratis concede roganti
Nam recte fecisse bonis in part lucrosu^ est

When thou shall give than give in friendly wise
Friendly content thou a prayer or a request
For thing yeuen by time is yeuen twice
Such gladsom chere makith yeftes richest
Who that yeueth gladly and sone yeueth is best
Loo no thing better may thing conquer
Than a man to lene that he may forbere
Quod tibi suspectum est confestim discute quid sit
Namque solent primo que su^t neglecta nocere

When upon a thing thou have a conjecture
As in thy conceyt holdyng in suspect
To discoure that anon do thy cure
For at the first when such thing is reject
That should sewe after his easy to correct
A thing that at the first is naught set by
Is often times seen to grieve finally
Cum te detineat veneris dampnosa voluptas
Indulgere gule noli que ventris amica est

And when thou art dysposed inwardly
To venus acts than express thy courage
Suffer not thy flessh than to lustelye
For great dicte makyth thy flessh outrage
Where as mesure might causen it to aswage
And glotenye is clepyd the chyef prometrice
Ledyng the flesh ay to wantonness and vice
Cum tibi proponas ai^alia cuncta timere
Vnum precipue hoi^em plus esse timendum

The rampant lion and the tigre fell
The Irous boor the hounde full of envy
And many moo bestis than here needs to tell
Men dreden full sore and eke their tyranny
And well they do but yet oon be espy
That is a fore al other most especial
Man is the beast that thou most dread shall
Cum tibi preualide fuerint in corpore vires
Hac sapias ai^o sic tu poteris vir fortis haberi

The virtue that is called fortitude
Stondeth al in the strength bodily
As to be Irous mighty strong and rude
But in the soul it must be sikerly
Nevertheless if thou wylt thy soul fortefye
And him within a queynte with sapyence
Treuly than shall thou be strong in existence
Auxilium a notis petito si forte laboras
Nec quisqua^ melior medicus quam fidus amicus

What thing in earth that thou shall take on hand
And thy supporte shall be in frendlynesse
No strange wight on live so nygh the wol stand
As thy known friend my child this is express
Of the stranger have thou no sikernesse
For when al other ben for to seche
The feithful known friend can best be thy leche
Cum sis ipse nocens moritur cur victima pro te
Stulticia est in mortem alterius sperare salutem

The death of bestis that been unreasonable
As by custume and right of sacrifise
To pourge the is no seth greable
Trust not also to get thy repryse
For they that trusten so ben full unwise
^y death of bestis god wol not quemed be
And a man abide stylle in his iniquyte
Cum tibi vel socium vel fidum queris amicum
Non tibi fortuna est hoi^s sed vita petenda

when thou would chese a friend for trustynesse
Of his fortune make none enquyraunce
For fortune is mother of chaungeablenesse
But ask of his deeds and his governance
For that is proved of gretter suffisaunce
Than ure of fortune that is casuelle
For life of man his fortune does excelle
Vtere quesitis opibus fuge nomen auari
Quid tibi di^^ie prosu^t si pauper habundas

Use well the richesse that thou have of quest
Of avarice the wicked fame eschew
Let not thy good lie ay stoppyd in thy chest
Keep not thy tresour and stuf ay closed in mewe
Such old tresour wol make thy shame new
What proffyteth plente and great tresure
And in pouerte a wretch alwey to endure
Si famam seruare cupis dum viuis honestam
Hac fugias ai^o que su^t mala gaudia vice

My sone if thou desire to rejoice thy fame
In honest while thou lyuest here
Eschew thing that may causen thy shame
And lycorous lusts must be leyde on here
And eke things feel that full joyous appear
Thy worlds joy is often full defectyf
Be waar of joy that lettith thy good life
Cum sapias ai^o noli irridere senectam
Nam quoqunque seen puerilis sensus in ille est

And ay my child assay and advertise
That thou never scorn the great stoupyng age
Thy elder my soke for no thing thou despise
Though al in their wits they be not so sage
As in their yongth sith age is outrage
When age comes this is soth certain
A man begins than to be a child ageyn
Disce aliquid nam cu^ subito fortuna recedit
Ars remanet vitamque hoi^s non deserit vnquam

Enforce thy wits sumwhat for to lere
Acqueynte the with cunnyng for it is sure
If fortune change and pouerte appear
Who that is cunnyng is likly to recure
Cu^nyng and craft remain ever and endure
And by them a man may sone releue
When fortune has cast him to myschieue
Prospicito cu^cta tacitus quod quisque loquatur
Sermo hoi^m mores celat et iudicat idem

Be stille in scilence with good aduysydnesse
Tarry my child til other have said
So shall thou learn sumwhat of steadfastness
Let never thy tongue suddenly be vnteyde
For that might the of hastynesse abreyde
By mannys word his manner wol be shewde
By word eke is known the wise from the lewd
Excerce studium quamuis parceperis artem
Vt cura ingenium sic et manus adiuuat vsum

Though of cunnyng thou have full great
Enforce the ay my child yet to learn more
The soul it is that must be thy receyt
Replenysshe here with virtues tresour and store
Use makyth mastrie use thou ay cu^nyng therefore
Use helps art and cure helpyth wit
Than use and cure to gedre must be knyt
Multum venturi ne cures tempora fati
Non metuit mortem qui scit contempnere vitam

The body from the soul shall have disseueraunce
Death is the end comune of every wight
Charge not therefore of dethis chance
The tribute of death must thou pay of right
But yet of death shall thou set but light
If by this lif thou set right naught express
The which is ay full of woo and wretchidnesse
Disce sed a doctis indoctos ipse doceto
Propaganda est etenim rerum doctrina bonarum

Learn ay of the wise and teache the vncu^nyng
For it is virtue and at al time commendable
To encrese doctrine through such co^menyng
It is eke alwey a deed of god charitable
Both to learn and to teache it is full greable
Doctrine helps virtue evermore on live
Which ne were doctrine sone from us would slyue
Hoc bibe quod possis si tu vis viuere sanus
Morbi causa mali namque est quecu^que voluptas

Drink not to much more than thou may bear
Reule well ay thy self with the bridel of mesure
To much drink wol thy body noye and dear
For surfeit is evermore of health unsure
And mesure makith men in health to endure
What man is reuled after lusts vile
In good astat he may abide no while
Laudaris quodcu^que palam quodcu^que probaris
Hoc vide ne rursus leuitatis crimine dampnes

And if it hap the my child in audience
A thing to praise be waar that thou not blame
Efte again right the same in presence
If thou dyspreyse commend not eke the same
Of such trauerse must needs rise shame
To preyse now and efte to blame express
It is a sign of great unsteadfastness
Tranquillis rebus que su^t aduersa caueto
Rursus in aduersis melius sperare memento

When thou lyuest here right at thyn own ease
In all thyn hertes joy rest and prosperity
Think yet parcas that prosperity may sese
For worldly wealth stands never in sikerte
And as sone when pouerte or aduersite
Assauteth the yet fall thou never in despair
Think ay in thy self good fortune may repair
Discere non cesses cura sapiencia crescit
Rara datur longo prudencia temporis vsu

It is full fair my child to be prudent
And wise look that thou learn fast therefore
To learn ay my sone do thyn entente
For by cure and business wysdam is the more
Wysdam is she that may not be forbore
The rare prudence that folks nyce refuse
Can never be had but by process and use
Parce laudato nam quem tu sepe probaris
Vna dies qualis fuerit monstrabit amicus

Bewaar also that thou never enhaunce
In thy laud or praysyng a wight to hye
For thou may have cause eft to disauaunce
Thy fame but ay thy praysyng modefye
For on a day thou shall full well espy
Whether he be friend that friendly semyth
For all be no friends that men demyth
Ne pudeat que nescieris te velle doceri
Scire aliquid laus est culpa est nil discere velle

Be not a shamyd also my child to lere
That thou can not for it is but a tetche
Of folly naught to desire doctrine to here
For well is him that to cu^nyng may stretche
For cu^nyngles a man is but a wretch
Therefore to cu^ne much it is right commendable
And eke naught to cu^ne it is most repreuable
Cum venere et bacho lis est et iuncta voluptas
Quod iustum est animo complectere sed fuge lites

Venus is ay ready to al her acts vile
When that bachus has her in largess
Through the tresour of her hete and fervent fire
Therefore my child thyn appetit thou repress
In wynes hot do thou never to great excess
Drink no more than for the soul is expedyent
Eschew stryf and ay with mesure be content
Dimissos animo tacitos vitare memento
Quo flumen est placidum fursan latet alcior vnda

The soleyn still man often menyth fraud and gyle
Of such a man eschew ay the companyr
For the stille man compassyth other while
Within his deceyt falshede and trecherye
In flodes stylle is water deep and hye
For often times betyde unhappy chance
In stremes soft semyng to thy plesaunce
Cum tua fortuna rerum tibi displicet vni
Alterius specta quo sis discrimine peior

With thy fortune when thou art dyscontent
And can not take in gre thyn adventure
Behold about and feel in thyn aduysement
How they that whilom were of goods more sure
Than thou and more likly in wealth tendure
Both for bounte favor and eke noblesse
And yet suddenly they have fall in to wretchydnesse
Quod potes id tempta nam litus carpere remis
Tucius est multo quam velu^ tendere in altum

Attempt the thing so as thou may suffyse
Pass never thy might bear never to high a sail
For there is perel if that the streme arise
Certain my child this is without fail
The vessel small is at full great avail
When that with oore to land he may a reche
When the sails high full often goon to wreche
Contra hoi^em iustum praue contendere uoli
Semper eni^ deus iniustas vlciscitur iras

Again the true just man braule thou never ne strive
For unto god above that is great displesaunce
Trust this trewly there is no man here on live
That to the just man does dear or greuaunce
But at the last god wol take vengeance
Therefore hereof it is reason each man to take
For the rightwys man of god is never forsake
Ereptis opibus noli merere dolendo
Sed gaude pocius si te contingat habere

If extorcion or of any mysauenture
Have plukked at the and made the thredbare
Of richesse yet do thou ay thy force and cure
To be merry and eschew thought and care
For fliteryng thought is a foul snare
Come not therein fortune is unstable
After pouerte richesse is preignable
Est iactura grauisque su^t amittere dampnis
Sunt quedamque far decet pacienter amicum

It is harm thy goods to forgoo
That been in hand with force and violence
But yet my child thou must considere who
And what he is that does such offense
Between friend and foo have ay a difference
For in so^me caas thou ought a friend forbere
And eke suffer him though he noye and dear
Tempora longa tibi noli promittere vite
Quodcu^que i^grederis sequitur mors corporis vmbra^

Be not sure that thou shall live here long
A wight shall dye al be it that he be loath or leef
And as the old so does the young eke among
Death stelith ay on as does a pryue thief
For ageyn death men may find no releef
She is about ay to make a fynal dyuorse
And follows each day the shadow of thy corse
Thure deum placa vitulum sieve crescat aratro
Net credas placare deum dum cede litatur

Worship god with all thy puyssaunce
With heart entier and sweet smellyng ensence
Such sacrifise is good to his pleasaunce
Of the calves small that never did offense
Though thou hem sle the blood may not dyspence
With the let hem grow and swynke in the plough
Thy true heart ay to god is suffisaunce is enough
Cede locu^ lesus fortune cede potenti
Ledere qui potuit aliquando prodesse valebit

Give place to him that excedyth thy might
Though thou be hurt it may proffyte par chance
And selde auaylith any man to fight
Ageyn such oon that passyth his puyssaunce
Though al it grieve now ^fte it may auaunce
For often is seen that after great duresse
The mighty man is full of gentillesse
Cum quid peccaris castiga te ipse subinde
Vulnera dum sanas dolor est medicina doloris

After thy surfeit and thy great offense
Chastise thy self correct that is amys
Redress the to good reule amend thy negligence
And sorrow for sin a very medecyne is
Repent the sore than art thou sauf I wys
For physik seyth my sone I the ensure
A bitter drink the sharp seknesse may cure
Da^pnaris nunquam post longum tempus amicu^
Mutauit mores sed pugnera prima memento

If thou have found good frendshyp in a wight
Long a goo and yet though he begin to change
Dispeyre him not men abide not in oon plight
For sumtyme was lordship there now is graunge
The worlds course is wonder queynt and strange
But though as now the man is were unkind
Yet is old frendshyp remembered ay in mind
Gracior offic^^s quo sis mage carior esto
Ne nomen subeas quod dicitur officiperdi

Though ^ ure the in office to be set
Than be thou gentil and gracious to other men
That they may report a goodly is met
With office and so good name shall (...)
About of the but assure the ^st when
The officer (...) unbound than says the prees
Now would to god that this man were officeles
Suspectus caueas ne sis miser omnibus horis
Nam timidis et suspectis aptissima mors est

Be not suspect that is a wicked teache
The suspect man with toward ferfulnesse
In his living is but a verry wretch
Mys is a mys but al he would redress
He demeth falls and fails hertlinesse
By falls conceyt set in malencolye
Sleth him anon thus death ends his folly
Cum seruos fueris proprios mercatus in vsus
Et famulos dicas hoi^es tamen esse memento

If thou have men without fredom and liberte
Such as ben cleped men of bondage
Notwithstanding they be under thy captyuyte
Yet honor such and over hem be not to outrage
If they be holden under thy worldly seruage
For all they be bound yet verrey men they be
That god has made them men yet ay remember the
Quam primum rapienda tibi est occasio prima
Ne rursus queras que iam neglexeres ante

Thy first fortune receive with readiness
Refuse it not though it be skant and small
It is well better in gree to take the less
Than to refuse it and after fail of al
Yeftes of fortune take hem ay as they fall
Refuse hem now and after thou shall have need
Therefore it is to take when me profre and bid
Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum
Felices obiunt quorum sine crimine vita

Rejoice the never my child in all thy lif
The sodeyn death of a cursid man and wreche
When he is deed the soul may not relef
From pain to joy the soul may not retche
The fendes hold ay sore that they may ketche
Therefore who that lives justly full well does he
For his soul is ay full of felicite
Cum coniunx tibi sit nec res et fama laborat
Vitandum ducas inimicu^ nomen amici

If thou have a wife in assurance
Trust her well and love her inwardlye
With heart with thought with al thy affiaunce
And be thou never infect with suspect Ielosie
If no fault be in her or that thou can espy
Yet if thy friend tell the such is the fame
He is a friend and she no thing to blame
Cum tibi contigerit studio cognoscere multa
Hac discas multa vita nescire doceri

When through study and great excersice
(...) know much and have great kunnyng
Yet ay do thy diligence in the most besy wise
To purchase more for it is an holsom thing
For to great honor cu^nyng may the bring
And eschew thou never daily to be taught
For without techyng cu^nyng may not be caught
Miraris verbis nudis me scribere versus
Hec breuitas sensus fecit coniungere binos

^f thou ought meruayl or lust to muse
In naked words why my versus thus I write
In no wise trewly I may me better excuse
Than say my wit so dull is and vnparfite
Which arteth me thus rudely for to endyte
By two and two my meter for to knyt
No thing causes me but symplenes of wit
Now I have gadered flowers to your list
Tastes them for they be preseruatyf
Holds them fast and bear them in your fist
For the pestylence eire which is infectif
I counceyl you and I ieparde my life
That ye should led your lif in sikernesse
And eke ateyne to much worthynesse
This mean I to you under protection
Of your good grace what time ye read
Or ellis have in this matter inspection
As it bids that ye wol do in deed
Than dar I afferme without dread
Ye shul acheue and be full virtuous
Here have I fond that shall ye guide and led
Straight to good fame and leave you in her house
