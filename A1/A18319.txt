A Declaration of the favorable dealing of her Majesty's Commissioners
appointed for the Examination of certain Traitors, and of tortures unjustly
reported to be done upon them for matters of religion.

1583.

To the Reader.
GOod Reader, although her Majesty's most mild and gracious government be
sufficient to defend it self against those most slanderous reports of
heathenish and unnatural tyranny and cruel tortures pretended to have been
executed upon certain traitors, who lately suffered for their treason, and
others, as well spread abroad by Runnagate Jesuits and Seminary men in their
seditious books, letters, and libels, in foreign countries and Princes
Courts, as also insinuated into the hearts of some of our own country men
and her Majesty's Subjects: Yet for thy better satisfaction I have conferred
with a very honest Gentleman whom I knew to have good and sufficient means to
deliver the truth against such forgers of lies and shameless slanders in that
behalf, which he and other that do know and have affirmed the same will at all
times justify. And for thy further assurance and satisfaction herein, he has
set down to the vewe of all men these notes following.

TOuching the rack and torments used to such traitors as pretended them selves
to be Catholics, upon whom the same have been exercised, it is affirmed for
truth, and is offered upon due examination so to be proved, to be as
follows. First, that the forms of torture in their severity or rigor of
execution, have not been such and in such manner performed, as the sclaunderers
and seditious libellers have sclaunderously and maliciously published. And that
even the principal offender Campion himself, who was sent and came from Rome
and continued here in sundry corners of the Realm, having secretly wandered
in the greatest part of the shieres of England in a disguised sort, to the
intent to make special preparation of treasons, and to that end and for
furtherance of those his labors, sent over for more help and assistance, and
cunningly and traitorously at Rome before he came from thence, procured
tolleration for such prepared rebels to keep themselves covert under pretense
of temporary and permissiue obedience to her Majesty the state standing as it
does, but so soon as there were sufficient force whereby the bull of her
Majesty's deprivation might be publicly executed, they should then join
altogether with that force upon peine of curse and damnation: that very
Campion, I say, before ye conference had with him by learned men in ye Tower,
wherein he was charitably used, was never so racked, but yt he was presently
able to walk, and to write, and did presently write and suscribe al his
confessions, as by the originales thereof may appear. A horrible matter is also
made of ye staruing of one Alexander Briant, how he should eat clay out of ye
walls, gathered water to drink from the droppings of houses, with such other
false oftentations of immanitie: where ye truth is this, yt whatsoever Briant
suffered in want of food, he suffered the same wilfully and of extreme
impudent obstinacy against ye mind and liking of those that dealt with him. For
certain traitorous writings being found about him, it was thought convenient
by conference of hands to understand whose writing they were, and thereupon he
being in her Majesty's name commanded to write, which he could very well do,
and being permitted to him to write what he would himself, in these terms,
that if he liked not to write one thing, he might write an other or what he
lysted (which to do being charged in her Majesty's name was his duty, and to
refuse was disloyal and undutiful:) yet the man would by no means be
induced to write any thing at all. Then was it commanded to his keeper to give
unto him such meat, drink, and other convenient necessaries as he would
write for, and to forbear to give him any thing for which he would not write.
But Briant being thereof advertised and often moved to write, persisting so in
his cursed heart by almost two days and two nights, made choice rather to lack
food, then to write for ye sustenance which he might readely have had for
writing, and which he had indede redely and plentifully, so soon as he wrote.
And as it is said of these two, so is it to be truly said of other, with
this, that there was a perpetual care had, and the Queens servants the
Warders, whose office and act it is to handle the rack, were ever by those
that attended the examinations specially charged, to use it in as charitable
manner as such a thing might be.

Secondly it is said, and likewise offered to be justified, yt never any of
these Seminaries, or such other pretended Catholics which at any time in her
Majesty's reign have been put to ye rack, were upon the Rack or in other
torture demanded any question of their supposed conscience, as what they
believed in any point of doctrine or faith, as the Mass, Transubstantiation,
or such like: but only with what persons at home, or abroad, and touching what
plats, practices and conferences they had dealt about attempts against her
Majesty's estate or person, or to alter the Laws of the Realm for matters of
Religion, by treason or by force, and how they were persuaded them selves, and
did persuade other touching the Popes bull and pretense of authority, to depose
Kings and Princes, and namely, for deprivation of her Majesty, and to
discharge subjects from their allegiance, expressing herein always the Kingly
powers and estates, and the subjects allegiance ciuily, without mentioning or
meaning therein any right that the Queen as in right of the Crown, has over
persons Ecclesiastical being her subjects. In all which cases, Campion and
the rest never answered plainly, but sophisticially decei^^^ully and
traitorously, restraining their confession of allegiance only to the
permissiue form of the Popes toleration. As for example, if they were asked,
whether they did acknowledge them selves the Queens subjects and would obey
her, they would say, Yea: for so they had leave for a time to do. But adding
more to the question, and they being asked, if they would so acknowledge and
obey her any longer then the Pope would so permit them, or not withstanding
such commandment as the Pope would or might give to the contrary, them they
either refused so to obey, or denied to answer, or said, that they could not
answer to those questions without danger: which very answer without more
saying, was a plain answer to all reasonable understanding, that they would
no longer be subjects, nor persuade other to be subjects, then the Pope gave
license. And at their very arraignement when they labored to leave in the
minds of the people and standers by, an opinion that they were to dye, not for
treason, but for matter of faith and conscience in doctrine, touching the
service of God, without any attempt or purpose against her Majesty, they cried
out that they were true subjects, and did and would obey and serve her
Majesty. Immediately, to prove whether that hypocritical and sophistical
speech extended to a perpetuity of their obedience, or to so long time as the
Pope so permitted, or no, they were openly in place of Judgment asked by the
Queens learned counsel, whether they would so obey and be true subjects, if
the Pope commanded the contrary: they plainly disclosed them selves in
answer, saying by the mouth of Campion, this place (meaning the Court of her
Majesty's Bench) has no power to enquire or judge of the holy Fathers
authority, and other answer they would not make.

Thirdly, that none of them have been put to the rack or torture, no not for
the matters of Treason, or partnership of treason or such like, but where it
was first known and evidently probable by former detections, confessions, and
otherwise, that the party so racked, or tortured, was guylty, and did know,
and could deliver truth of the things wherewith he was charged: so as it was
first assured, that no innocent was at any time tormented, and the rack was
never used to wring out confessions at adventure upon vncerteinties, in which
doing, it might be possible that an innocent in that case might have been
racked.

Fourthly, that none of them has been racked or tortured, unless he had
first said expressly, or amounting to as much, that he will not tell the truth,
though the Queen command him. And if any of them being examined did say he
could not tell, or did not remember, if he would so affirm in such manner as
Christians among Christians are believed, such his answer was accepted, if
there were not apparent evidence to prove yt he wilfully said untruly. But if
he said yt his answer in delivering truth, should hurt a Catholic, and so
be an offense against charity, which they said to be sin, and that the
Queen could not command them to sin, and therefore, howsoever the Queen
commanded, they would not tell the truth, which they were known to know, or
to such effect: they were then put to the torture, or else not.

Fifthly, that the proceeding to torture was always so slowly, so unwillingly,
and with so many prepararations of persuasions to spare themselves, and so many
means to let them know that the truth was by them to be uttered, both in
duty to her Majesty, and in wisdom for themselves, as whosoever was
present at those actions, must needs acknowledge in her Majesty's ministers, a
full purpose to follow ye example of her own most gracious disposition: whom
God long preserve.

Thus it appears, yt albeit by the more general laws of nations, torture
has been, and is lawfully judged to be used in lesser cases, and in sharper
manner for inquisition of truth in crimes not so near extending to public
danger, as these ungracious persons have committed, whose conspiracies and the
particularities thereof it did so much import and behoue to have disclosed, yet
even in that necessary use of such proceeding, enforced by ye offenders
notorious obstinacy, is nevertheless to be acknowledged, the sweet
temperature of her Majesty's mild and gracious clemency, and their
slanderous lewdenes to be the more condemned, that have in favor of heinous
malefactors, and stubborn traitors, spread untrue rumors and slanders to make
her merciful government disliked under false pretense, and rumors of
sharpness and cruelty, to those against whom nothing can be cruel, and yet
upon whom nothing has been done, but gentle and merciful.

FINIS.
