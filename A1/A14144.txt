That faith the mother of all good works justifies us / before we ca^
bringeforth any good work: as the husbonde maryeth his wife before he ca^
have any lawefull chylderne by her. Forthermore as the husbonde marieth not his
wife / yt she should continue unfruitful as before / and as she was in y^
state of virginire (where in it was i^possible for her to bear fruit) but
contrary wife to make her fruitful: even so faith justifies us not / that is
to say / maryeth us not to God / yt we should continue unfruitful as before /
but that he should put the seade of his holy sprite in us (as saint John in
his first pistle calls it) and to make us fruitful. For says Paul Ephesians.
ij. By grace are ye made safe through faith / and yt not of your selves: for it
is the gift of God and comes nor of the works / lest any man should bost him
self. For we are his workemanshipp created in Christ Jesu unto good works /
which God has ordained yt we should walk in them.

William Tyndale otherwise called hychins to the reader.
GRace and peace with all manner spiritual fealinge and livinge worthy of the
kyndnes of Christ / be with the reader and with all that thurst the will of God
Ame^. The cause why I set my name before this little treatise and have not
rather done it in the new testament is that then I followed the cownself of
Christ which exhorts men Matthew. vj. to do their good deades secretly and to
be content with the conscience of well doing / and that God sees us / and
patiently to abide the reward of the last day which Christ has purchased for
us and now would feign have done like wise / but am compelled other wise to do.

While I abode a faithful co^panyon which now has taken a another vyage apo^
him / to preach Christ where (I suppose) he was never yet preached (God which
putt in his heart thither to goo send his sprite with him / co^ forte him and
bring his purpose to good effect) one William Roye a man somewhat craftye
when he comes unto new accoyntaunce and before he be through known and namely
when all is spent / came unto me and offered his help. As long as he had no
money / somewhat I could ruele hi^. but as soon as he had gotten him money / he
became like him self again. Nevertheless I suffered all things fill y^ was
e^ded which I could nor do alone without one both to write and to helpeme to
compare y^ textes together. When that was ended I took my leve and bode him
farewell for our two lyves / and as me^ say a day longer. After we were
departed he went / and gate him new fre^des which thing to do he passes all
that ever I yet knew. And there when he had stored him of money he got him to
Argentine where he professes wonderful faculties and makes bost of no small
things. A year after that and now.xij. months before the printinge of this
work / came one Iero^ a brother of Grenewich also / through worms to Arge^tine
/ saienge that he intended to be Christ's disciple a another while and to keep
(as nigh as God would geve him grace) the profession of his baptim / and to get
his lyvinge with his hands / and to live no longer ydely and of the sweet and
labor of those captives which they had taught / not to beleve in Christ: but
in cut shows and russet coetes. Which Ierom with all diligence I warned of
Royes boldness and exhorted him to bewarre of him and to walk quyetly and
with all patience and long sofferinge acordinge as we have Christ and his
Apostles for an e^sample / which thing he also promised me. Nevertheless when
he was comen to Argentine william Roye (whose tongue is able not only to make
foles sterke mad / but also to disceave the wisest that is at the first sight
and accoyntaunce) gate him to him and sert him a work to make times / while he
him self translated a dialoge out of laten in to englisch / in whose prologe
he promyseth moare a great deall than I fere me he will ever pay. Paul says
the second pystell to Thimothe the second Chapitter* the servant of the lord
must not stryve / but be peaceable unto all men and ready to teach / and one
that can suffer the evel with meekness / and that can inform them that
resist. If god at any time will geve them repentance for to know the
throuth. It becomes not then the lords servante to use raylinge rymes / but
Gods words which is the right wepon to slaye sin / vice and all iniquite.
The scripture of God is good to teach and to improve. ij. Thim. iij. and.ij.
These. ij. Paul speakinge of Antichriste says / whom the lord shall destroy
with the sprite or breath of his mouth that is / with the word of God. And.ij.
Corinthians.x. The wepons of our war are not Carnal things (says he) but
mighty in God to cast down strong holds and so forth / that is / to
destroy hye byldinges of false doctrine. The word of God is yt day where of
Paul speaks.j. Corint. iij.) which shall declare all thing / and that fire
which shall try every man's work and consume false doctrine: with that sword
ought me^ sharply to fight / and not to rail with folishe rymes. Let it not
offend the that some walk inordinatly let not the wickedness of Judas cause
the to despice the doctrine of his fellows. No man ought to think that Steven
was a falls preacher be cause that Nicolas which was chosen fellow with him
(Act. vj.) to ministre unto the widows fell after i^ to great heresies as
historyes make mention. Good and evell goo always to geder / one can not be
known with out the other. Mark this also above althinges that Antichrist is
not an outward thing that is to say aman that should sodenli appear with
wonders as our fathers talked of him. No verily for Antichriste is a spiritual
thing And is as much to say as agaynft Christ / that is one that preaches
false doctrine contrary to Christ. Antichrist was in the old Testame^te and
fought with the Prophets / he was also in the ryme of Christ and of the
Apostles as thou readist in the Pistles of John and of Paul to the Corinthia^s
and Galathians / and other Pistles. Antichrist is now and shall (I dout not)
endure till the worlds end. But his nature is (when he is uttered and
overcome with the word of god) to go out of the Play for a season and to
disgyse him self and then to come in again with a new name and new raymente.
As thou seist how Christ rebukes the scribes and the Pharisees in the Gospel
(which were very Antichrists) sayi^ge woe be to you pharisees for ye rob
widows houses ye pray long prayers under a color / ye sheet up the
ki^gdome of heve^ and sofre not the^ that woold to enter in / ye have take
away the fay of knowleage / ye make me^ break gods commandments with your
tradicions / ye begyle the people with ypocresy and such like. Which things
all our prelates do: but have yet gote^ them new names and other garments /
and are other wise disgised / There is difference in the names between a pope /
a Cardinal / a Bisshope / and so forth / and to say a scribe / a pharisey / a
seniour and so forth: but the thing is all one. Even so now when we have
uttered him / he will change him self ones moare and turn him self in to an
angel of light.ij. Corinth. xi. Read the place I exhort the / what so ever
thou art that read this and note it well. The Jews look for Christ and he
is come fyftyne hundred years a goo and they not ware: we also have looked for
Antychriste and he has reigned as long and we not ware: and that because
either of us looked carnally for him and not in the places where we ought to
have sought. The Jews had found Christ verily if they had sought hi^ in the
law and the prophets / whither Christ sends the^ to seek. Jhohn.v. We also
had spied our Antichriste long a goo if we had looked in the doctriue of
Christ and his Apostles / where be cause the beast sees hi^ self now to be
sought for / he roereth and seeks new holys to hide him self in and changes
hi^ self in to a thowsande fafcionis with a^^inaner wilenes falshede suttelte
and craft. Because that his exco^munycations are come to light he makes it
trayson unto the king / to be acointed with Christ. If Christ and they may not
raygne together / one hope we have that Christ shall live ever. The old
Antichrists brought Christ unto Pilate saying / by onr law he ought to die /
and when Pilate bade the^ Judge him after there law they answarad it is not
lawful for us to kill any man which they did to the entente that they which
regarded not the shame of there false exco^munications / should yet fere to
confess Christ because that the te^po^all sword had condemned him. They do
all thing of a good zeele they say / they love you so well that they had lever
brunne you then that you schuld have feloweshippe with Christ. They are
gelowese over you a miss (as seyth saint Paul Gal. iiij.) They would devide
you from Christ and his holy testame^te / and join you to the pope to beleve
in his testame^te and promises. Some man will ask parauenture why Itake the
labor to make this work in as much as they will bru^ne it saying they bru^t
the Gospel I answare in brunninge the new testamente they did none other thing
the^ that I looked for / no more shall they do if the brunne me also if it be
gods will it shall so be. Nevertheless in translatinge the new testamente I
did my durye / and so do I now / and will do as much more as god has ordened
me to do. And as I offered that to all me^ to correct it / who so ever could
even so do I this Who so ever therefore read this / compare it unto the
scripture. If gods word bear record unto it and thou also felest in thine
heart that it is so be of good comfort and geve god thanks. If gods word
condemn it / then hold it a cursrd / and so do all other doctrines As Paul
counseleth his galathiens. Beleve not every sprite suddenly / but judge them by
the word of god which is the trial of all doctrine and lasts for ever Amen.

The parable of the wicked mammon.
THere was a certain rich man / which had a steward that was acused unto him
that he had wasted his goods And he called him and said unto him. How is it
that I hear this of the? Geve a co^ptes off thy stewardshippe. For thou may
be nolo^ger my steward. The steward said with in him silfe. what shall I do?
for my master will take away from me my stewardeshippe. I ca^ not dig / and
to beg / I am a shamed. I woote what to do / that when I a^ put out of my
stewardshippe / they may receave me in to there houses.

The^ called he all his masters detters / and said unto the first / how much
owe thou unto my master? And he said / an hundred tonnes of oil / and he
said to him. take thy bill / and sit down quickly / and write fifty. Then
said he to another / what owe thou? And he said. an hundred quarters of
wheat. He said to him. Take thy bill / and write four scoore. And the lord
co^me^ded the unjust steward / because he had done wysly. For the children of
this world / are in their kind / wyser then the children off light. And I
say also unto you / make you friends of the wicked ma^mon / that when ye shall
have need / they may receave you into everlastinge habitacions. Luke xvj.
Chapter.

For As much as with this and diverse soch other textes / many have e^forsed to
draw the people from the true faith and from puttinge their / truft in the
truth of Gods promyses and in the merits and deservinge of his Christ our
lords and have also brought it to pass (for many false prophets shall arise
and deceave many and much wekednes must also be / says Christ Mat. xxiiij.
And Paul says ij. Timoth. iij. Evell men and deceavers shall prevail in evell
while they deceave and are deceaved them selves) and have taught them to put
there trust in their owen merits and brought them in belefe that they shall be
instified in the sight of god by the goodness of there own works and have
corrupt the pure word of god to confirm their Aristotell with all. For
though that the philosophers and wordly wise me^ were enemies above all enemies
to the gospel of God / and though the wordly wisdom can not comprehe^de the
wisdom of god as thou may see.j. Corinthi. j. and. ij And though wordly
ryghteousnes can not be obedient unto the righteousness of god To. x. yet what
so ever the read i^ Aristo. that must be first true. And to mayntene that
they re^te and tere the scriptures with there disti^ccio^s and expon^de the^
violently contrary to the meani^ge of the text / and to the circumstances
that go before and after and to a thousand clear and evide^te textes.
Werefore I have taken i^ hand to expon^de this gospel and certain other
places of the new testame^te and (as fer forth as god shall le^de me grace) to
bri^ge the scripture unto the right sense and to dig again y^ wells of
Abraham and to purge and cle^se the^ of the earth of wordly wisdo^e / where with
these philistenes have stepped the^. Which grace grant me God / for the love
that he has unto his son Jesus dure lord / unto the glory of his name.
Ame^.

THat faith only before allwerfes and whith out all merits / but Christ's only
justifies and settith us at peace with god is provid by Paul in the first
chapter to the To. I Am not ashamed (says he) of the gospel / that is to say
/ of the glad tithi^ges and promises which god has made and sworn to us in
Christ. For it (that is to say the gospel) is the power of god unto salvacyon
/ to all that beleve. And it follows in the forsaid chapter / the Just or
rightewes must live by faith. For in the faith which we have i^ Christ and in
gods promises find we mercy / life / favor / and peace. In the law we find
death / da^natio^ / and wrath: more over the curse and ve^geaunce of god apo^
us. And it (that is to say the law) is called of Paul.ij. Cor. iij. the
ministra cio^ of death and damnacio^. In the law we are proovid to be the
enemies of god / and that we hate him. For how can we be at peace with god and
love him / saying we are conceaved and borne under the power of the devil and
are his possession and kingdom / his captives and bondme^ / and lead at his
will / and he holdith our hertis / so that it is i^possible for us to consent
to the will of god / much more is it impossible for a man to fufill the law /
of his own strnegth and power seeing that we are by birth and of nature the
heirs of eternal damnacyon. As says Paul Ephe. ij. We (says he) are by
nature the chylder of waath. Which thing the law does but utter only and
helpyth us not / ye requiryth impossyble things of us. The law when it
commands that thou shall not lust / geveth the not power so to do / but
da^nenith the / because thou can not so do.

IF thou wylt therefore be at peace with God and love him / thou must turn to
the promyses of God and to the Gospel which is called of Paul in the place
before rehearsed to the Corinthia^s / the mynistracion of ryghtwesnes and of the
spyryte. For faith brings pardon and forgyvenes freely purchased by Christ's
blood and bri^geth also the spryte / the spryte loeseth the bonds of the
devyll and sets us at lybertye. For where the spryte of the lord is there
is liberty says Paul i^ the same place to the Corinhtia^s / that is to say /
there the heart is fre and has power to love the will of God / and there the
heart morneth that he ca^ not love enough. Now is that consent of the heart unto
the law of God eternal life / ye though there be no power yet in the me^bres
to sulfyll it. Lat every man therefore (according to Paul's counsel i^ the.vj.
chapter to the ephesians.) are me himself with the armoure of God / that is to
understand / with Gods promyses / and above all thing (says he) take unto you
the shyld of faith / where with ye may be able to quench all the f^rey darts
of the wicked / that ye may be able to resyst in the evyll day of re^tacio^ /
and namelye at the hour of death.

Se therefore thou have Gods promyses in thine heart and that thou beleve the^
with out waveringe: and when re^tacyon arriseth / and the devyll lays the
law and thy deades against the / answare him with the promyses and turn to
God and confess thy self to him and say it is even so / or else how could he
be merciful? but remember that he is the God of mercy and of truth and ca^
not but fulfill his promyses. Also remember that his sons blood is stronger
the^ all the sins and wyefydnes of the whole world and there with quiet thy
self and there unto commit thy self and bless thy self in all temtatyon
(nameli at the hour of death) with that holy candle. Oelse perishist thou
though thou have a thousand holy candles about the / a hundred ton of holy
water / a shipfull of pardones / a cloth sack full of freres coetes and all the
ceremonies in the world and all the good works / de servynges and merytes of
all the men in the world / be they or were they never so holy. Gods word only
lasts for ever and that which he has sworn does abide / when all other
things perish. So long as thou findist any consent in thine heart unto ye
law of God / yt it is righteous and Good / and also displeasure yt thou can
not fulfill it / despere not / nether doubt / but yt Gods sprite is in ye /
and yt thou art chosen for Christ's sake / to the enherytaunce of eternal life.

And again To. iij. We suppose yt ama^ is justified through faith with out ye
deades of ye law. And like wise To. iiij. we say yt faith was rekened to
Abraham for rightwesnes. Ite^ To. v. seeing yt we are justified through faith /
we are at peace with God. Ite^ To. x. With ye heart does a man beleve / to be
made righteous. Item Galat. iij. Receavid ye ye spirit by ye deades of ye law
or by heari^ge of ye faith? Does he wihich ministers ye sprite unto you and
works miracles among you / do it of the deades of the law or by heringe of
faith? Even as Abraham beleved God and it was rekened him for righteousness.
Understand therefore (says he) that the chyldern of faith are the chyldern of
Abraham. For the scripture saw before / that God would iustifye the hethen or
gentyls by faith and showed before Glatydinges unto Abraham / in thy sede shall
all nations be blessed. Wherefore they which are of faith are blessed / yt is to
were made rightewes with righteous Hbraha^ For as ma^y as are of the deades of
the law are under curse. For it is written / says he cursed is every man that
co^tynueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
fulfill them.

Ite^ Gala. ij. where he resysted peter in the face he says. We which are Jews
by nacio^ and not sinners of the ge^tyls / know that a man is not iustyfyed by
the deades of the law / but by the faith of Jesus Christ and have therefore
beleved on Jesus Christ / that we might be Justified by the faith of Christ /
and not by the deades of the law: for by the deades of the law: shall no
flesh be iustyfyed. Ite^ in the same place he says / twichi^g that I now lyve
I lyve in the faith of the son of God / which loved me and gave him self for
me I despice not the grace of God. For if righteousness come by the law / the^
is Christ dead in vain. And of soch like ensamples are all the epistles of
Paull full. Mark how Paull laborith with himself to express the exceadi^ge
misteryes of faith in the epistle to the ephesia^s / and in the epistle to the
Collossyans. Off these and many soch like textes are we sure that the forgivenes
of sins and iustyfyinge is appropriate unto faith only without the addinge to
of works.

Take for the also the sickness that Christ ma* keth Mathei. vij. A good tree
brings forth good fruit. And a bad tree brings forth bad fruit. There seist
thou that the fruit makes not the tree good / but the tree the fruit / and
that the tree must before hand be good or be made good: yer it can bring forth
good fruit As he also says Math. xij. either make the tree good and his fruit
good also / either make the tree bad and his fruit bad also. How can ye speak
well while ye your selfs ar evil? So like wise is this true and no thing
more true / that a man before all good works must first be good / and that it
is impossible that works should make him good / if he were not good before /
yer he did good works. For this is Christ's pri^ciple and (as we say) a
general rule. How can ye speak well / while ye are evyll? so like wise how
ca^ ye do good / while ye are evil.

This is therefore a plain / and a sure conclusion not to be dowred of / that
there must be first in the heart of a man before he do any good work / a
gretter and a preciouser thing the^ all y^ good works in y^ world to reco^sile
hi^ to God to bri^ge y^ love and favor of God to hi^ / to make hi^ love God
again / to make hi^ righteous and good in y^ sight of god / to do a may his
sin / to deliver hi^ and loose hi^ / out of that captivite where in he was
co^ceavid and borne / i^ which he could nether love God nether the will of God.
Or else how ca^ he work any good work that should please God / if there were
not some supernatural goodness in hi^ give^ of god freely where of ye good work
must spri^g? eve^ as a sick man must first be healed or made whole / ye^ he ca^
do ye deades of an whole man / and as ye blind man must first have sight
givi^ hi^ yer he ca^ see: and he yt has his feet in fetters gives or stocks
must first be loosid or he can go / walk or ru^ne / and eve^ as they which
thou readist of in the gospel yt they were possessed of y^ devils / could not
laud God til ye devils were cast out.

That preciouse thing which must be in the heart yer a man ca^ work any good
work is the word of god / which in y^ gospel praecheth profereth and bri^geth
unto all that repent and beleve / the favor of God in Christ. Who so ever
herith the word and belevith it / the same is there by righteouse and there by
is geven him the sprite of God / which leadith him unto all that is the wylll
of God and is loosed from the captyvyte and bondage of the devyll / and his
heart is free to love God / and has lust to do the will of God. Therefore it
is called the word of lyse / the word of grace / the word of health / y^
word of rede^cio^ / the word of forgevenes / and ye word of peace / he yt
hereth it not or belevith it not / can by no means be made rightous before
god. This co^fermith Peter i y^ xv. of the acts / seeing that God through faith
does purify the hertes. For of what nature so ever the word of God is / of
the same nature must the hertes be which beleve thereon and cleave thereunto. Now
is the word lyvinge / pure / righteouse and true / and even so makes it the
hertes of the^ that believe thero^.

IF it be said that Paul (when he says in the.iij. to the Romans / no flesh
shall be or canbe iustyfied by the deades of the law) means it of the
ceremonies or sacrifices / it is a lie verilye. For it follows immediately / by
the law comes the knowleage of sin. Now are they not the ceremonies that
vtture sin / but the law of co^mandeme^tes. In the.iiij. (he says) the law
causes wrath which can not be understand of the ceremonies for they were geve^
to reconsyle the people to god again after they had sinned. If as they say
the ceremonies which were geven to purge sin and to reconsile / iustifye not
nether bless / but temporallie only / much more the law of commaundmentes
instifyeth not. For that which provith a man sick healith him not / nether
does the cause of wrath bring to favor / nether can that which da^neth save a
man. When the mother co^maundith her child / but even to rock the cradell /
it grudgith* the commandment does but vttur the Poison that lay hidd / and
settith hi^ at ba^e with his mother and makith him beleve she lovith him not.

These co^mau^dme^tes also (thou schalt not covet thy neigbours house thou shall
not lust desire or wisshe after thy neighbors wife serva^t / maid ox or ass
/ or what so ever pertainith unto thy neighbor) geve me not power so to do /
but utter the poison that is in me and da^pne me / because I can not so do /
and prove that god is wrath with me / sei^ge that his will and mine are so
contrary. Therefore says Paul Gal. iij. If there had bin geve soch a law that
could have geven life / then no doubt righteousness had come by the law but
the scripture concluded all under sin (says he) that the promise might be
geve^ unto the^ that beleve through the faith that is i^ Jesus Christ.

The promises when the are beleved / are they that justify / for they bring
the spirit which Ioesith the heart gives lust to the law and certifieth us of
the good will of god unto us ward. If we submit our selfs unto god and
desire him to heal us / he will do it / and will in the mean time (because of
the consent of the heart unto the law) count us for full hole and will no more
hate us / but pity us / cherish us be tender hertid to us and love us as he
does Christ him self* Christ is our redemer savar / peace / atonement / and
satisfaction / and has made amends or satisfactyon to Godwarde for all the
sin which they that repent (consentinge to the law and beleving the
promyses) do / have done or shall do. So that if through fragylite we fall a
thousand times in a day / yet if we do repent again / we have all way mercy
laid up for us in store in Jesus Christ our lord.

WHat shall we sayethen to those scriptures which goo so sore upon good works?
As we read Math. xxv. I was an hongred and ye gave me meat etc. And soch like.
Which all sownd as though we should be i^styfied and accepted unto the favor
of God in Christ through good works. This wise answare I. Many there are which
when they hear or read of faith / at tonce they consent there unto and have a
certain ymaginacio^ or opinion of the ^ayth / as when a man tellith a storye
or a thing done in astraunge land / yt pertayneth not to them at all. Which
yet they beleve and tell as a true thing. And this imaginacio^ or opinion they
call faith. They think no forther then yt ^ayth is a thing which stondith in
there own power to have / as do other natural works which men work: but
they feel no manner workinge of ye spirit nether the terrible sentence of the
law / the fearful judgments of God / the horrible da^nacion and captivite
under satan. Therefore as soon as they have this opinion or ymaginacio^ in
there hertis: yt says / verily this doctrine seems true / I beleve it is eve^
so. The^ they think that the rigtht faith is there. But afterward when they
feel in the^ selves / and also se in other that there is none alteracio^ / and
that the works follow not but yt they are altogether eve^ as before / and
abide in there old estate: the^ think they yt faith is not sufficient / but
that it must be some gretter thing the^ faith that should justify a man.

So fa^le they a way from faith again / and cry sayi^ge faith only justifies
not a man / and makes hi^ acceptable to God. If thou ask the^ wherefore.
They a^swere / se how many there are yt beleve and yet do no moare the^ they
did before. These ar they which Judas i^ his epistle callith dreamers which
deceave the^ selfs with there own fantasi^s. For what other thing is there
ymaginacio^ which they call faith / the^ a dreami^ge of y^ faith / and an
opinion of there own ymaginacio^ wrought with out y^ grace of god? These must
ne^des beworse at y^ later end the^ at the biginninge. These ar the old
vessels / yt re^t when new wine y^ powered i^ to the^ Mat. ix yt is / they hear
Gods word but hold it not / and therefore wax worse the^ they were before.
But y^ right faith spri^geth not of ma^s fantes* nether is it in any man's power
to obtain it / but is all to gether the pure gift of God poured in to us
frelye with out all manner doing of us with out deservinge and merits / ye
and without sekinge for of us. And is (as says Paull in the second to the
Ephesians) even gods gift and grace purchasid thorou Christ. Therefore is it
mighty in operation / full of virtue and ever workinge / which also renueth a
man and begettith him a fresh / alterith him changes him / and turns him
all togedre in to a new nature and conversacion: so that a man fears his heart
all togedre altered and changed and far oderwise desposed the^ before / and
has power to love that which before he could not but hate / and deliteth i^
that which before he abhorred / and hates that which before he could not but
love. And it sets the soul at liberty and makes her free to follow the
will of god / and does to the soul even as health does unto the body / after
that a man is pined and wasted a way with a long soekinge disease. The legs
can not bear him / he can not lift op his hands to help him self / his taste
is corrupt / sugar is bitter in his mouth / his stomach abhorrith longinge
after sibbersause and shashe / at which a whole stomach is ready to cast his
gorge. When health commith / she chau^geth and alters him clean / gevith him
strength in all his members and lust to do of his own accord that which
before he could not do neder could suffer that any man exhorted him to do /
and has now lust in wholesome things / and his me^bres ar fre and at liberty
and have power to do of there own accord all things which belo^ge to an
whole man to do / which before they had no power to do / but were in
captivity and bondage So like wise in all thing does right faith to the soul.

The sprite of god acompanieth faith / and bringith with her light where with a
man beholdith hi^ self i^ the law of god / and seith his miserable boundage
and captivity / and humbles him self / and abhors hi^ self: she bri^geth
Gods promises of all good thiges in Christ God works with his word / and
in his word And as his word is preached / faith wroteth her self in the
hertes of the elect: and as faith enters and the word of god is beleved /
the power of god loeseth the heart from the captivity and bondage under sin /
and kni^teh and coupleth him to god and to the will of god / alters him and
changes him clean / facyoneth and forgeth him a new / gevith him power to
love and to do that which before was impossible for him either to love or do /
and turns hi^ i^ to a new nature: so that he loves that which he before
hated / and hates that which he before loved / and is clean altered and
changed and contrary desposed / and is knyt and coupled fast to Gods will /
and naturally brings forth good works / that is to say / that which God
commands to do / and not things of his own ymagynacyon. And that does he
of his own accord as a tree brings forth fruit of her own accord. And as
thou neadist not to bid a tree to bring forth fruit / so is there no law put
unto hi^ that beleveth and is justified thorou faith (as says Paul i^ y^
first pistle to Timothe the first Chapter) Nether is it neadfull. For the law
of God is written and graved in his heart / ^o his pleasure is therein. And as
with out commandment but even of his own nature / he eats drinks / sees
/ hereth / talks / and goes: even so of his own nature / with out coaccion
or compulsyon of the law / brings he forth good works. And as a whole man
when he is a thurst / taryeth but for drink / and when he hongreth abides but
for meat / and then drinks and eats naturally: even so is the faithful
ever a thurst and an hongred after the will of God / and taryeth but for
occasyon. And when so ever an occasyon is geven / he works naturally the will
of God. For this blessinge is geven to all them that trust in Christ's blood /
that they thrust and hongre to do Gods will. He that has not this faith / is
but an unprofitable babbler of faith and works / and wotteth another what he
bableth nor what he means or where unto his words pertayne. For he fealeth
not the power of faith nor the workynge of the spirit in his heart / but
enterpreteth the scriptures which speak of faith and works / after his own
blind reason and folysh fantasies and not of any fealinge that he has in his
heart: as a man reherseth a tale of an other manes mouth and wotteth not wether
it be so or not as he says / nor has any experyence of the thing self. Now
does the scripture ascrybe both faith and works not to us / but to god only /
to whom they belong only / and to who^ they are appropiate / whose gift they
are and the proper work of his spirit.

Is yt not a froward and perverse blindness? they reach how a man can do
nothing of his own self / and yet presumtuously take upon them the greatyst
and highest work of God / even to make faith in them selfs of their own power
and of there own false ymaginacion and thoughts. Therefore I say / we must
despere of our selfs / and pray God (as Christ's Apostels did) to geve us
faith / and to increase our faith. When we have that / we neade no other thing
moare. For she brings the spirit with her / and he not only teaches us all
things / but works the^ also mightly in us and carries us thorou aduersite /
persecution / deeth and hell / unto heven and everlastinge life.

Mark diligently therefore saying we are come to a^sware. The scripture because
of soch dreamers and fained faithes sake / uses soch manner of speakinges of
works / not that a man should thereby be made good to Godwarde or justified /
but to declare unto other / and to take of other the difference between false
fained faith and right faith. For where right faith is / there brings she
forth good works / if there follow not good works / it is no doubt but a
dream and an opinion or fained faith.

Where fore look as the fruit makes not the tree good / but declarith and
testifies outewardly that the tree is good (as Christ says) every tree is
known by his fruit: eve^ so shall ye know the right faith by her fruit.

Take for an ensample mary that anointed Christ's feet / Luke.vij. When Simo^
which bade Christ to his house had condemned her / Christ defended her and
justified her sainge: Simo^ I have a certain thing to say unto the. And he
said master say on. There was a certain lender which had two detters / the
one oug^te five hundret pense / and the other fifty. When they had nothing to
pay he for gave both. Which of them tell me / will love him most? Simon
answered and said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to
him / thou have truly judged. And he turned him to the woman / and said unto
Simo^ Seist thou this woman? I entered in to thine house / and thou gave me no
water to my feet / but she has weshed my feet with tears / and wipte them
with the heeres of her heed Thou gave me no kiss / but shesens the time I
came in / has not ceased to kiss my feet. My heed with oil (which is but a
vile thing) thou have not anointed. And she has anointed my feet with
costly and preciouse oyntement. Wherefore I say unto the / many sins ar
forgeven her for she loves much. To whom less is forgeven / the same does
love less etc. Hereby se we that deades and works are but outward signs of
the inward grace of the bounteous and plenteous mercy of god freely received /
with out all merits of deades / ye and before all deades. Christ teaches to
know the inward faith and love / by the outward deades. Deades are the
fruits of love / and love is the fruit of faith. Love and also the deades are
great or small according to the proporcio^ of faith. Where faith is mighty and
strong there is love fervent and deades plentuouse and done with exceeding
mekenes Where faith is weak / theris love cold and the deades few and fadith
as flowers and blosomes in winter. Simon beleved and had faith / yet but
weaklie / and according to the proporcyon of his faith loved coldlye / and had
deades thereafter: he bade Christ unto a simple and a bare feast only / and
received hi^ not with any great humanite. But Mari had a strong faith / and
therefore burninge love / and notable deades done with exceadinge profounde and
deape mekenes. On the on side shesawe her self clearly in the law / both in
what danger she was in / and her cruel bondage under sin / her horrible
damnacyon and also the fearful sentence and judgment of God upon sinners. On
the odersyde she herd the gospel of Christ preached / and in the promysses she
saw with egles eyes the exceadinge abundaunt mercy of God / that passes all
vtteraunce of speech / which is set forth in Christ for all meke sinners. Which
knowleage there sins. And she beleved the word of God myghtylye and glorified
God over his mercy and truth / and being overcome and overwhelmed with the
unspeakable ye and incomprehensyble aboundante riches of the kyndnes of God /
did inflame and burn in love / ye was so swollen in love / that she cowld not
abide nor hold / but must break out / and was so drunk in love that she
regarded no thing / but evyn to utter the fervent and burning love of her
heart only. She h^d no respect to her self / though she was never so great
and notable a sinner / nethther to the curyouse ypocrysye of the phareses which
ever dysdayne weke sinners / nether the costlynes of her oyntement / but with
all humblenes did run unto his fete. Weshed them with the tears of her eyes
/ and wypyd them with the heyrys of her head / and anointed them with her
precious oyntement / ye and would nodow^e have run in to the ground under
his fete to have vtt^ered her love toward him / ye would have descended down
in to hell / if it had been possible. Even as Paul i^ the neynth Chapter of his
pystle to the Romyans was drunk in love and overwhelmed with the plentuousnes
of the infinyte mercy of god (which he had received in Christ unsought fore)
wyshed him self baneshy^ from Christ and damned / to save the Jews / if it
might have been. For as a man fealeth God in him self / so is he to his
neighbor.

Mark an oderihinge also. We for the most part because of our grossenes / in
all our knouwleage proceade from that which is last and hinmost unto that
which is first / beginning at the later end / disputinge and making our
arguments backwarde. We begin at the effect and work and proceed unto the
natural cause. As because of an ensample we first se the moon derke / and then
sherch the cause / and find that the puttinge of therth between the sone and
the moon is the natural cause of the darkness and that the earth stops the
light. The^ dispute we backewarde saying: the moon is darknede / therefore is
the earth directli between the sone and the moon. Now yet is not the derknes of
the moon the natural cause that therth is between the sone and the moon / but
the effect thereof and cause declarative / declari^ge and leadinge us unto the
knowleage / how that the earth is between the sone and the moon directlye and
causes the derknes / stopping the light of the son from the moon. And
co^trar^e wise the being of the earth directelye between the sone and the moon
is the natural cause of the derknes. Life wise he has a sone therefore is he a
father / and yet the sone is not cause of the father / but contrary wise. Not
with stondinge the son is the cause declarative / where bye we know that the
other is a father. After the same manner here / many sins ar forgeven her /
for she lovethe much / thou may not onderstand by the word for / that love
is the natural cause of the forgeuinge of sins / but declares it only / and
contrary wise the forgevenes of synes is the natural cause of love.

The works declare love. And love declares that there is some benefit and
ki^dnes showed or else would there be no love. Whi works one and an other not?
Or one more then an other? Because that one lovyth and the other not / or that
the one loves more then the other. Whilovyth one and an other not / or one more
then an other? Because that one fealeth the exceeding kyndnes of god in his
heart and an other not / or that on fealeth it more than an other. Scripture
spaeketh after the most grossest manner. Be dilygent therefore that thou be not
deceaved with curyousnes. For men of no small reputacyon have been dceeaved
with there own sophistrye.

HEreby now seist thou / that there is great difference between being
righteous and good in a ma^s self / and declari^ge and vtteri^ge righteousness
and goodness. The faith only makes a man safe / good / righteouse and the fre^d
of god / ye and the son and the heir of God and of all his goodness and
possesses us with the spyryte of God. The work declares the self faith and
goodness. Now uses the scripture the common manner of fpeatinge / and the very
same that is among the people. As when a father says to his child / go and be
loving merciful and good / to soch or soch a poor man / he byddyth him not /
there with to be made mercyful / find and good: but to testyfye and declare the
goodness that is i^ him all ready with the outward dead: that it may break
out to the profet of other / and that other may feel it which have neade there
of.

After the same manner shall thou enterprete the scriptures which make mencyon
of works: that God thereby will that we show forth that goodness which we have
received by faith / and let it break forth and come to the profet of other
that the false faith may be known and weded out by the roetes. For God geveth
no man his grace / that he should let it lie still and do no good with all:
but that he should encreace it and multyplye it with lendinge it to other / and
with opynly declaringe of it with the outward works / provoke and draw other
to God / As Christ says in Matthew the fyft Chapter let your light so shine in
the sight of men that they may se your good works / and gloryfye your father
which is in heven. Or else were it as a treasure dygged in the ground and hyd
wisdom / in which what profett is there?

More over there with the goodness / favor / and gystes of God which are in the
/ not only shall be known unto other / but also unto *thine own self / and thou
shall be sure that thy faith is right / and that the true spyryte of God is in
the / and that thou art called and chosen of God unto eternal life / and
loosed from the bonds of Satan whose captyve thou wast / as Peter exhorts in
the first of his second epistle / through good works to make our calling and
elecetyon (where with we^ar called and chosen of God) sure. For how dare a man
presume to think / that his faith is right / and that Gods favor is on him
/ and that Gods spryte is in him (when he fealeth not the workynge of the
spyryte / nether him self desposed to any godly thing. Thou can never know
or be sure of thy faith / but by the works / if works follow not ye and that
of love / with out lokinge / after any reward / thou may be sure that thy
faith is but a dream and not right / and even the same that James called i^
his pistel the.ij. Chapter deed faith and not iustifienge.

Abraham through works Genesis.xxij. was sure of his faith to be right / and
that the true fear of God was in him / when he had off ered his son (as the
scripture says) Now know I that thou fear god / y^ is to say Now is it
open and manifest that thou fear God / in as much as thou have not spared
thy only son for my safe.

SO now by this abide sure and fast y^ a man inwardly in the heart and before
God is ryghteons and good through faith only before all werfys. Not with
standinge yet outwardly and openly before the people / ye and before him self /
is he righteons throw the work / that is / he fuowith and is sure throw the
outward work that he is a true belever and in the favure of God and righteous
and good through the mercy of God / that thou may call the one an opyn and an
owtward rightwesnes / and the other an inward righteousness of the heart (so
yet) that thou vndersiond by the outward righteousness / no oder thing save the
fruit that follows / and a derclaringe of the inward Justyfyinge and
righteousness of the heart / and not that it makes a man righteous before God /
but that he must first berighteons before him in the heart. Even as thou may
call y^ fruit of the tree / the outward goodness of the tree which folowith and
v^^erth the inward nature all goodness of the tree.

This means James in his pystle where he says / faith without worfes is deed
these ye / if works follow not / is a sure and an evydent sign / that there is
no faith in the heart / but a deed ymagynacyon and dream which they falssly
call faith.

Off the same wise is this sainge of Christ to be understand. Make you friends
of the unrighteous mammon / that is show your faith openly and what ye are
within in the heart / with outward geving and bestowinge your good is on the
pore / that ye may obtain friends / that is / that the pore on whom thou have
shewede mercy may at the day of Judgment testyfye and witness of thy good
works. That thy faith and what thou wast within in the heart before God may
there apre by thy fruits openly unto all men. For unto the right belevinge
shall all things be confortable and unto consolacyon at that terryble day.
And contrary wise unto the vnbelevinge / all thing shall be unto desperacyon /
and confucyon / and every man shall be judged openly and outwarly in the presens
of all men / acordinge to there deades and works. So that not with out a cause
thou may call them thy friends / which testyfie at that day of the / that
thou levedst as a true and a right Christen man and folowedst the steps of
Christ in shewinge mercy / as no donte he does which fealeth God merciful in
his heart. And bythe works is the faith known / that it was right and
perfect. For the outward works can never please God nor make friend / except
they spring of faith. For as much as Christ him self Maith. in the.vi.
and.vij. Chapter dysaloweth and casts away the works of the phareseys: ye
prophesyenge and workinge of miracles and casting out of devyls / which we
count and esteem for very excellent virtues. Yet make they no fre^des with
there works / while there hertes are false and vnpure and there eye double. Now
with out faith is no heart true or eye syngle: so that we are compelled to
confess that the works make not a man righteous or good but that the heart
must first / be righteous and good yer any good work proceed thense.

SEco^darily all good works must be done free with a syngle eye with out
respect of any thing / and that no profet be sought thereby.

That commands Christ / where he says Mar. x fre have ye received / fre
geve again. For look as Christ with all his works did not deserve heven / for
that was his all redye / but did us servyce therewith / and nether looked nor
sought his own profit^ / but our profit / and the honor of God y^ father
only. Eve^ so we with all our works may not sefe our own profit / nether
in this world nor in heve^ / but must and ought freely to work / to honor God
with all / and without all manner respect / sefe our neighbors profit and do
him service. That means Paul Philip. ij. sayng. Bemynded as Christ was which
being in the shappe of God / equal unto God and even very God / laid that a
part / that is to say / hyd it. And to^e on him the form and faseyon of a
servaunt. That is / as co^cerninge him self he had enough / that he was full /
and had all plentuousnes of the Godhed / and in all his works sought our
profit and became our servant.

The cause is. For as much as faith instifieth and puts a way sin in the
sight of God / brings life / health and the favor of God / makes us the
heirs of God / powers the spryte of God in to our souls and fylleth us with
all godlifulnes in Christ / it were to great a shame / rebuke and wrong unto
the faith / ye to Christ's blood / if a man would work any thing to purches
that where with faith has endued him allredye / and God has geven him freely.
Even as Christ had done rebuke and shame unto him self / yff he would have
done good works and wrought to have bi^ made thereby Gods son and heir over
all / which thing he was allredie. Now does faith make us the sons or
chyldern of God. Johan. i. he gave them might or power to be they sons of God
/ i^ that they beleved on his name. If we be sons / so are we also heirs
To. viij. and Gala. iiij. How can or ought we the^ to work / for to purches
that entherytaunce with all where of we are heirs all redye by faith?

What shall we say then to those scriptures which sownde as though a man should
do good works and lyve well for heve^s sake or eternal reward? As these are
/ make you fre^des of the unrighteous mammo^. And Mat. vij. Gather you treasure
together in heve^. Also Mat. xix. If thou will enter in to life keep the
commandments and soch like. This say I / that they which understand nor /
nether feel in there hertes what faith means / talk and think of the reward
eve^ as they do of the work / nether suppose they that a man ought to work
but in a respect to the reward. For they ymagen that it is in the kingdom of
Christ / as it is in the world among men / that they must deserve heven with
there good works. How be it there thoughts are but dreams and false
ymaginacions. Off these men speaks Malachias Chap. i. who is it among you
that shuts a doere for my pleasure for naught? that is / with out respect
of reward. These are serva^tes / that seek gaynes and vauntage / hyrelinges
and day laborers which here on earth receave there rewards / as the phareses
with there prayers: and fasii^ges Matthew. v.

But on this wise goes it with heve^ / with evirlasting life and eternal
reward / like wise as good works naturally follow faith (as it is above
rethersed) so that thou neadest not to co^mannde a true belever to work or to
compel him with any law / for it is impossible that he should not work / he
taryeth but for an occasion / he is ever desposed of him self / thou neadest
but to put him in remembrauuce / and that to know the false faith from the
true. Eve^ so naturally does eternal life follow faith and good lyvinge /
without sekingfor / and is impossible that it should not come / though no man
thought there on. Yet is it rether sed in the scripture / alleged and promised
to know the difference between a falls belever and a true belever / and that
every man may know what follows good lyuinge naturally and of it self with
out takinge^ thought for it.

Take a gross ensample. Hell that is / everlastinge death is threatened unto
sinners / and yet folowith it sin naturally without sekinge for. For no man
does evell to beda^ned therefore / but had lever avoyde it. Yet there the one
follows the other naturally / and though no man told or warned him of it /
yet should the sinner find it / and feale it. Nevertheless it is therefore
thretened / that men may know what folowyth evyll lyvinge. Now then as after
evell levinge folowyth his reward unsought for / even so after good levinge
follows his reward naturally unsought for or unthought upon. Even as when thou
drinkest wine / be it good or badde / the taste follows of it self / though
thou therefore drink yt not. Yet testyfieth the scripture / and it is true /
that we are by enheritance heirs of damnatyon / and that yer we be borne / we
are vessels of ye wrath of God and full of that poison whence naturallye all
sins spring / and where with we can not but sin / which thing the deades
that follow (when we be hold our selves in the glass of the law of God) do
declare and utter / kill our consciences and show us what we were and wist
not of it and certyfieth us that we are heirs of damnacyon. For if we were of
God we should cleve to God and lust after the will of God. But now our deades
compared to the law declare the contrary and by our deades we se our selfs /
both what we be and what our end shall be

Go now thou seyst that life eternal and all good things are promised unto
faith and belefe: so that he that beleveth on Christ / shall be safe. Christ's
blood has purcheasyd life for us and has made us the heirs of God: so that
heven comes by Christ's blood. If thou woldist obtain heven with the merytes
and deservinges of thine own works / so dyddist thou wrong / ye and
shamedist the blood of Christ / and unto the were Christ dead in vain. Now is
the true belever heir of God by Christ's deservinges / ye and in Christ was
predestynate and ordened unto eternal life / before the world began. And when
the Gospel is preached unto us we beleve the mercy of God / and in belevinge
we receave the spryte of God / which is the ernyst of eternal life / and we
are in eternal life already / and feale already in our hertes the swetnes
thereof / and are overcome with the kyndnes of God and Christ and therefore love
the will of God / and of love are ready to work freely / and not to obtain that
which is gevyn us freely and where of we are heirs already.

Now when Christ says. Make you fre^des of vrighteous mammon. Geder you
treasure together in heve^ and soch like. Thou scist that the meaning and
intent is no another / but that thou should do good / and so will it follow of
it self naturally / without seking and taking of thought / that thou shall
find fre^des and treasure in heven and receave a reward. So late thine eye be
single / and look unto good livinge only and take no thought for the reward:
But be content. For as much as thou knowist and art sure that the reward and
all thing contained in Gods promises follow good lyvingenaturally / and thy
good works do but testify only and certyfie the that the spryte of God is in
the / who^ thou have received in ernest of Gods truth / and that thou art heir
of all the goodness of God / and that all good things are thine all ready
purcheased by Christ's blood and leid up in stoere against that day when
every man shall receave according to his deades / that is / according as his
deades declare and testify / what he is or was For they that look unto the
reward / are slow false / suttell and crafty workers / and love the reward
moare then the work / ye hate the labor / ye hate God which commands
the labor / and are weary both of the commandment and also of the co^maunder
/ and work with tediousnes. But he that works of pure love with out sekinge
of reward / works truly.

Thrydly that not the Saints / but God only receaveth us in to eternal
tabernacles / is so plain and evident / that it neadeth not to decleare or
prove it. How shall the Saints receave us in to heven / when every man has
neade for him self / that God only receave him to heven / and every man has
scace for him self: As it appears by the fyve wise vyrgyns Matthew. xxv. which
would not geve of there oil unto the onwyse vyrgyns. And Peter says in
the.iiij. of his first pistle that the righteous is with difficultye saved. So
seyst thou that the saying of Christ / make you friends and so forth / that
they may receyve you in to everlastinge tabernacles / pertayneth not unto the
saints which are in heven / but is spoken of the pore and neady which are here
present with us on Erihe / as though he would say. What byldyft thou churches /
foundest Abbays / chauntryes / and colleages in the honor of saints / to my
Mother / saint Peter / Paul and saints that be deed to make of them thy
friends? They neade it not / ye they are not thy friends but there is. Which
lyved the^ when they did / of whom they were helpen. Thy friends are the pore
which are now in thy time and lyve with the / thy pore neybours which neade thy
help and succoure. Them make thy friends with thy unrighteous mammon / that
they may testyfye of thy faith / and thou may know and feel that thy faith
is right and not feigned.

UNto the second / soche receavinge in to everlastinge habitacio^s is not to
be understand / that me^ shall do it. For many to whom we show mercy and do
good shall not come there / nether skylleth it / so we mekely and lovingly do
our duty / ye it is a sign of strong faith / and fervent love / if we do
well to the evyll / and study to draw them to Christ in all that lies in us.
But the pore geve us an occasyon to exercyce our faith / and the deades make
us feale our faith and certyfye us and make us sure that we are safe / and are
escaped and translated from death unto life / and that we are delyvered and
redeemed from the captyvyte and boundage of Saran / and brought in to the
lybertye of the sons of God in that we feel lust and strength in our heart /
to work the will of God. And at that day shall our deades appear and comfort
our hertes / witnese our faith and truft which we now have in Christ which
faith shall then keep us from shame / as it is wryttryn. None that beleveth in
him shall be ashamed Romans ix. So that good works help our faith / and make us
sure in our consciences and make us feale the mercy of God. Not withstandinge
heven / everlastinge life / Joye eternal / faith the favor of God the
spyryte of God lust and strength unto the will of God / are geven us freely / of
the bountoeus and plenteous riches of God purehasede by Christ / with out our
deservinges / that no man should rejoice / but in the lord only.

FOr a forder understanding of this Gospel / may here be made.iij. questions.
What ma^monis / whi it is called unrighteous / and after what manner Christ
byddyth us counterfeit and follow the unjust and wicked stuard which with his
lords damage provided for his own profit and vantage / which thing no doubt
is unrighteous and sin.

First Mammon is an Ebrewe word and signifies riches or temporal goods /
and namelye all superfluyte / and all that is above necessyte and that which is
required unto our necessary uses / where with a man may help an other / with
out vndoi^ge or hurti^ge himself. For hamon in the Ebrewe speech signifies a
multitude or abundaunce or many. And therehence comes mahamo^ or ma^mon
abou^dau^ce or ple^teousnes of goods or riches

Secu^daryly / it is called vnrichteous mammon / not because it is gotten
unrighteously or with usury. For of unrighteous gote^ good ^s can no man do
good works / but ought to restore them whom again. As it is said Ysaias.lxj.
I a^ a god that hates offeri^ge that comes of robbery. And Galo. pro. iij.
says / honor the Lord of thine own good. But therefore is it called
unrighteous / because it is in unrighteous use. As Paul speaks unto the
Ephesia^s.v. how that the days are evil though that God has made them / and
they are a good work of Gods making. How be it they are yet called evil /
because that evyll men use them amiss / and much sin / occasyo^s of evil /
perrell of soulis are wroughte in the^. Eve^ so is riches called evil because
that evil me^ bestow it amiss and misuse the^. For where riches is there
goes it after the common proverb. Be that has money has what him lysteth.
And they cause fyghtinge / stelinge / leynge a wait / lyinge / flatteringe and
all unhappiness against a ma^s neighbor. For all men hold on riches part.

But singularly before God is it callled unrighteous mammon / because it is not
bestowed and mynistred unto our neighbors neade For if my neybour need and I
geve him nor / nether depart lyberally with him / of that which I have: than
wythhold I from him unrighteously that which is his own. For as much as I am
bownden to help him by the law of nature / which is / what so ever thou
would that a another did to the that do thou also to him. And Christ Mathei.
v. Geve to every man that desires the. And John in his first pystle / if a man
have this worlds good and se his brother neade / how is the love of God in
him? And this unrighteousness in our mammon se very few men. Because it is
sprituall / and in those goods which argoren most truly and iustlye / which
begyle men. For they suppose they do no man wrong in kepinge them / in that
they got them not with stelinge / Robbinge / oppression / and usury / nether
hurt any man now with them.

Thrydly many have busyed the^ selfs instudye^ge what or who this unrighteous
steward is / because that Christ so praises him. But shortly and plainly
this is the answer. That Christ prayseth not the vnrighteotus stuard / nether
sets him forth to us to counterfett / because of his unrighteousness but
because of his wisdom only in that he with unright so wisely provided for hi
self As I if I would provoke a another to pray or study say. The the ves
watch all night to rob and stele: why can not thou watch to pray and to
study? Here praise not I the thief and murderer for there evyll doi^ge / but
for there wisdom / that they so wisely and diligently wait on there
unrighteousness. Like wise when I say miss women tire them selfs with gold
and sylke to please there lovers. What wylt not thou garnysh thy soul with
faith to please Christ? here praise I not whordome / but the diligence which
the whore mysvseth.

Off this wise Paul also Roma. v. likeneth Adam and Christ together / saying
that Adam was a figure of Christ. And yet of Ada^ have we but pure sin / and
of Christ grace only / which are out of measure contrary. But the symylytude
or lyknes stondeth in the origynall birth / and not in the virtue and vice of
the birth. So that as Adam is father of all sin / so is Christ father of all
righteousness. And as all sinners spring of Adam. Even so all righteous men and
women spring of Christ. After the same manner is here the unrighteous stuarde
an ensample unto us in his wisdom and dylygence only / in that he provided so
wisely for him self / that we with righteousness should be as dylygente to
provyde for our souls / as he with unrighteousness provided for his body.

Like wise may thou soil all other textes which sound as though it were
between us and God as it is in the world where the reward is moare looked upon
/ then the labor: ye where men hate the labor and work falsely with the
body / and not with the heart and no longer than they are looked upon / that the
labor may appear outward only.

When Christ says Mathe. v. Blessed are ye when they rail on you / and
persecute you / and say all manerevyll sayings against you / and yet lie /
and that for my sa^e / rejoice and be glad / for your reward is great i^
heve^. Thou may not ymagen that our deades deserve ye Joye and glory yt
shall be geve^ unto us. For the^ (paul. says To. xi.) favor were not favor I
ca^ not receare it of favor and of ye bou^teous goodness of God freely / and by
deservig of deades also. But beleve as the gospel / glad tythynges and
promyses of god say unto the yt for Christ's bloudes sake only through faith /
god is at one with y^ and thou received to mercy and art become the son of
god and heir a^nexed with Christ of all the goodness of god ye ernest where of
y^ ye sprite of god poured i to our hertes. Of which thiges ye deades are
wittenesses and certify our co^scie^ces yt our faith is unfeigned and yt the
right sprite of god is i us. For if I pacie^tly suffer adversite and
tribulation for conscience of god only y^ is to say / by cause I know god and
testify y^ treuth. Tha^ am I sure yt god has chosen me in Christ and for
Christ's sake / and has put in me his spryte / as an erneste of his promyses /
whose workyng I feale in mine heart / the deades beringe wittenes unto they
same. Now is it Christ's blood only that deserved all the promises of God and
that which / I soffre and do is partly y^ curinge healinge and mortyfienge of
my me^bres and killinge of that original poison / where with I was co^ceaved
and borne / yt I might be altogedre like Christ / and partly ye doing of my
durye to my neighbor / whose detter I am of all yt I have receavid of God / to
draw hi^ to Christ with all suffringe / with all pacie^s and eve^ with
shedi^ge my blood for hi^ / not as an offeringe or merit for his sins / but
as an ensample to provoke him. Christ's blood only puts away all the sin
yt ever was / is or shall be from them that are elect and repent belevinge the
Gospel that is to say gods promises in Christ.

Again in the same.v. chaprer love your enemies / bless the^ yt curse you do
well to the^ yt hate you and persecute you / yt ye may be ye sons of your
father which is in hevin. For* he makes his son shine apo^ evyll and on good
/ and sends his rain upon Just and unjust. Not yt our works make us ye
sons of God / but testify only and certify our co^scie^ces yt we are ye
sons of God and that God has chosen us and weshed us in Christ's blood /
and has putt his spryte in us. And it follows / if ye love the^ that love you
/ what reward have ye? do not ye publicanes eve^ ye same? and if ye shall have
favure to your fre^des only what synguler thing do ye? do not y^ publicanes
even the same? ye shall be perfect therefore as your father which is in heve^ is
perfect. That is to say if yt ye do no thing but that ye world does / and they
which have the spirit of ye world / wherebye shall ye know y^ ye are the
sons of God and beloved of God / more than the world? But and if ye
counterfette and follow God in well doing the^ no doubt it is a sign yt the
spyrite of God is in you and also the favor of God / which is not in the
world and that ye are enheretours of all the promyses of God / and elect unto
ye fellowship of ye blood of Christ.

ITem Math. vi. Take heed to your Alms / that ye do it not in ye sight of me^
to the intent yt ye would be seen of the^ / or else have ye no reward with your
father which is in heven. Nether cause a trompet to be blowe^ a fore the when
thou do thine Alms / as ye ypocrytes do in the synagoges and in the
streets to be gloryfyed of the world. but when thou doist thine Alms let not
thy lift hand know what thy right ho^d does / that thy Alms may be in secret
/ and thy sather which seith in secret shall reward the openly. This puts
us in remembrance of our duty / and shows what follows good works / not
that works deserve it / but that the reward is leyd up for us in store / and
we there unto elect through Christ's blood / which the works testyfye. For if
we be worldly minded and do our works as the world does / how shall we know
that god has chosen us out of the world? But and if we work freely / with
out all manner worldly respect / to show mercy / and to do our duty to our
neighbor / and to be unto hi^ as God is to us / the^ are we sure that the
favor and mercy of God is apo^ us and that we shall enjoy all the good
promises of God through Christ which has made us heirs thereof

ITem in the same chapter it folowyth. When thou prayst be not as the ypocrytes
/ which love to stond and pray in the synagoges and in the corners of the
streets / for to be seen of men. But when thou prayest enter in to thy chamber
and shut thy door to / and pray to thy father which is in secret / and thy
father which seith in secret shall reward the openly. And like wise when we
fast (teaches Christ in the same place) that we should behave our selfs that
it appear not unto me^ how that we fast / but unto our father which is in
secret / and our father which seith in secret shall reward us openly. These.ij.
textes do but declare what follows good works / for eternal lyse comes
not by the deservinge of works but is (says Paul in the.vj. to the Romans)
the gift of God through Jesus Christ. Nether do our works iustyfye us. For
except we were iustyfyed by faith which is our righteousness and had the spryte
of God in us to teach us / we could do no good work freely with out respect of
some profit / other in this world or in the world to come / nether could we
have spyrituall Joy in our hertes in time of affliction and mortyfyinge of the
flesh

Good works are called the fruits of the sprite / Gal^. v. Cap. for the sprite
works them in us / and some time fruits of righteousness / as in the second
pystle to the Corrynthyans.ix. Chapter. before all works therefore we must have
a righteousness within in the heart / the mother of all works / and from whence
they spring. The righteousness of the scribes and Pphareses / and of the^ that
have the spirit of this world / is ye glorious show and outward shininge of
works. But Christ says to us Mat. v. except your righteousness excede the
righteousness of the scrybes and pharisees / ye can not enter in to the kingdom
of heve^. It is righteousness in the world / if a man kill not. But a Christen
perceaveth rihhteousnes if he love his enemy / evyn when he suffers
persecuc^o^ and torme^te of him / and the pains of death / and morneth more
for his adversaries blindness than for his own pain / and prays God to open
his eyes and to forgeve him his sins / as did Steven in the Acts of the
Apostles the.vij. Chap. and Christ Luc. xxiij.

A christen co^sidereth him self in the law of God / and there puts of him
all manner ryghteousnes. For the law suffers no merits no deservinges / no
ryghteousnes / nether any man to be justified in the sight of God. The law is
spiritual and requires the heart and commandments to be fullfillyd with
soch love and obedience as was in Christ. If any fulfill all that is the will
of God with soch love and obedience / the same may be bold to sell pardons of
his merits / and else not.

A Christen therefore (when he beholds him sylfe in the law) puts of all
manner righteousness / deservinges and merits / and mekely and unfeignedly
knowleageth his sin and mysery / his captyvite and bondage in the flesh / his
trespass and gylte / and is there biblessede with the pour in spyrite Math.
v. Cha. Then he morneth in his heart / be cause he is in soch bondage that he
can not do the will of God / and is an hongred and a thrust after righteousness.
For righteousness (I mean) which springs out of Christ's blood / for
strength to do the will of God. And turns him self to the promyses of God /
and desires him for his great mercy and truth / and for the blood of his
son Christ to fulfill his promyses / and to geve him strength. And thus his
spryte ever prays within him. Be fasteth also not one day for a weke / or a
lent for an whole year / but professes in his heart a perpetual sobyrnes /
to tame the flesh and to subdue the body to the spyryte / until he wax strong
in the spyrite and grow ripe in to a full ryghteousnes after the fulness of
Christ. And be cause this fulness happens not till the body be slain by
deeth / a Christian is ever a sinner in the law / and therefore fasteth and
prays to God in the spyryte / the world saying it not. Yet in the promyses he
is ever righteous / through faith in Christ and is sure that he is heir of all
gods promyses / the spryte which he has received in ernest / bering him
wittenes / his heart also and his deades testifyenge the same.

Mark this then. To se inwardlye that the law of God is so spiritual / that
no slesh can fulfill it. And then for to morn and sorrow and to desire / ye
to ho^ger and thurst aftyr strength to do the will of God from the ground of
the heart / and (not withstandi^ge all the soutelty of the devlis / wekenes and
feebleness of the flesh / and wondringe of the world) to cleve yet to the
promises of God / and to beleve that for Christ's blood sake thou art received
to the entherytaunce of eternal life / is a wonderful thing / and a thing
that the world knows not of: but who so ever fealeth that (though he fall a
thousand times in a day) does yet rise again a thousand times / and is sure
that the mercy of God is upon him.

IF ye forgeve othermen there trespases / your hevenlye father shall forgeve
you youres / Matthew. in the.vi. Chapter yff I forgeve / God shall forgeve me /
not for my deades sake / but for his promises sake / for his mercy and truth
/ and for the blood of his son Christ our lord. And mi forgeving
certifieth my sprite that God shall forgeve me / ye that he has forgeven me
all redye For if I consent to the will of God in my heart / though through
infirmite and wekenes I can not do the will of God at all times / more over
though I can not do the will of God so purelye as the law requires it of me
/ yet if I se my fault and mekely knowleage my sin / wepinge in mine heart
because I ca^ not do the will of God / and thurst after strength / I am sure
that the sprete of God is in me / and his favor upon me. For the world
lusts not to do the will of God / nether soroweth because he can not /
though he sorrow some time for fear of the pain that he beleleveth shall
follow. He that has the sprite of this world can not forgeve with out ame^des
making or a greater vau^tage. If I forgeve now how comes it? verily because I
feale the mercy of God in me. For as a man fealeth god to him self / so is he
to his neighbor I know by mine own experience that all flesh is in bondage
under sin and ca^ not but sin / therefore am I merciful and desire God to
loose the bonds of sin even in mine enimye.

OEther not treasure to gether in earth etc. Matthew. vi. But gather you treasure
in heven etc. Let not your hertes be glued to worldy things study not to
heap treasure apo^ treasure and riches apo^ riches / but study to bestow
well that which is gote^ already / and let your habunda^ce succore ye lack
and neade of the po^r which have not. Have an eye to good works / to which if
ye have lust and also power to do the^ / then ar ye sure that the sprite of God
is in you / and ye in Christ elect to the reward of eternal life which
follows good works. But look yt thine eye be single and rob not Christ of
his honor ascribe not yt to ye deservi^ge of thy works which is geve^ the
freely by the merits of his blood. In Christ we are sons In Christ we are
heirs / In Christ God chose us and elected us before the beginning of the
world / created us anewe by the word of the Gospel / and put his sprite in us
/ for because we should do good works. A Christian man works by cause it is
the will of his father only. If we do no good work nor be merciful / how
is our lust therein? If we have no lust to do good works / how is Gods sprite
in us? If the sprite of God be not in us / how ar we his sons? How ar we his
heirs / and heirs annexed with Christ of the eternal life which is promised
to all them that beleve in him? Now do our works testify and wittenes what we
are / and what treasure is lead up for us in heve^ / so that our eye be syngle
and look upon the commandment with out respect of any thing / save because
it is Gods will / and that God desires it of us / and Christ has deserved
that we do it.

Math. vii. Not all they yt say unto me lord / lord / shall enter in to the
kyngedome of heven / but he yt does the will of my father which is in heven.
Though thou can laud God with thy lips / and call Christ lord / and can
babble and talk of the scripture / and know all the stories of the bible.
Yet shall thou there by never know thine election or whether thy faith be
right. But and if thou feale lust in thine heart to the will of God / and
bring forth the fruits thereof / then have thou co^fedence and hope / and thy
deades and also the sprite whence thy deades spring certyfye th^^* Heart that
thou shall enter / ye art all ready entered in to the kingdom of heven. For it
follows / he that hears the word and does it / / byldeth his house upon a
rock / and no tempest of temptacyons can over through it. For the sprite of
God is in his heart and comforts him / and holds him fast to the rock of
the merits of Christ's blood / in whom he is elect. Nothing is able to pluck
him out of the hondes of God / God is stronger then all things. And contrary
wise he that hears the word and does it not / byldeth on the sonde of his
own ymaginacion and every re^pest over throws his byldinge. The cause is /
he has not Gods spyrite in him / and therefore vndersto^deth it not a right
another works a right. For no man knows the things of god (says Paul in
the.i. pistle to the Corinthia^s in ye second Chapter) save the sprite of God:
as no man knows what is in a man / but a ma^s sprite which is in him. So then
if the sprite be not in a man / he works not the will of God nether
vndersto^deth it though he babble never so much of ye scriptures. Nevertheless
soch a man may work after his own ymaginacion / but Gods will ca^ he not
work / he may offer sacrifice / but to do mercy knows he not. It is casye
to say unto Christ Lord / Lord: but thereby shall thou never feale or be sure
of y^ ki^gdone of heve^. But and if thou do ye will of God the^ art thou sure
that Christ is thy lord in dead / and that thou in hi^ art also a lord / in
that thou fealest thy self loosed and free from the bondage of sin / and
lusty and of power to do the will of God.

Where the spryte is there is fealinge. For the spryte makes us feale all
things. Where the spryte is not there is no fealinge / but a vain opynion or
ymaginacyon. A physycian serves but for syck men / and that for soch sick men
as feale there sekeneses and morn therefore / and long for health. Christ like
wise serves but for sinners only as feales there sin and that for soch
sinners / that sorrow and morn in there hertes for health. Health is power or
strength to fulfill the law or to keep the co^mandementes. Now he that longs
for that health yt is to say / for to do the law of God is blessed in Christ
/ and has a promise that his lust shall be fulsylled and yt he shall be made hole.
Math. v. blessed ar they which ho^gre and thurst for rightwesnes sake (y^ is to
fulfill the law) for there lust shall be fulfilled. This longyng and consent of
the heart unto the law of God / is the workynge of ye spryte which God has
poured in to thine heart in ernest that thou myghtyst be sure that God will
fulfill all his promyses that he has made ye. It is also the seal and mark
which God puts on all men yt he choseth unto everlastinge life. So long as
thou seist thy sin / and mornest / and consentest to ye law and longest
(though thou be never so weke) yet the spyryte shall keep the in all
te^ptacions from desperacion and certyfye thine heart / yt God for his troth /
shall delyver the and save y^ / ye and by thy good deades shall thou be saved
/ not which thou have done / but which Christ has done for the. For Christ is
thine / and all his deades are thy deades. Christ is in the and thou in him
knyt to gether inseparably. Nether can thou be damned except Christ be damned
with the. Nether can Christ be saved except thou be saved with him. Moreover
thy heart is good / right / holy and Just. For thy heart is no enymye to the law
but a fre^d and a lover. The law and thy heart ar agreyd and at one / and
therefore is God at one with the. The consent of the heart unto the law / is
unite and peace between God and man. For he is not mine enemy which would feign
do me playsure and morneth be cause he has not where with. Now he that opened
thy disease unto the and made y^ long for health / shall as he has promised
heal y^ / and he yt has loosed thy heart shall / at his Godly laysur / loese
thy me^bres. He that has not the sprite has no fealing / nether lusts or
lo^geth after power to fulfill the law / nether abhors the pleasures of
sin / nether has any moare certente of the promyses of God / than I have of
a tale of Robin hode / or of some test that a man tells me was done at Rome
Another man may lightely make me doubt or beleve the contrary / seeing I have
no experience thereof mi self. So is it of them that feale not the workyng of
the spyryte / and ther^ore in time of tem^acyon the byldinges of there
ymagynacyons fall.

MAthei. x. He that recceavith a prophet in the name of a prophet / that is
because he is a prophet shall receave therewarde of a prophet and he that
geveth one of these lytleons a cup of cold water to drink / in the name of a
dyscyple / shall not lose his reward. Note this that a prophet signifies as
well him that enterpreteth the hard places of scripture / as him that
prophisies things to come. Now he that receaveth a prophet / a just man / or
a disciple / shall have the same or like reward / that is to say / shall have
the same eternalllyfe / which is appointed for them in Christ's blood and
merytes. For except thou were elect to the same eternalllyfe / and had the
same faith and trust in God / and the same sprite / thou cowldest never consent
to there deades and help them. But thy deades testyfye what thou art and
certyfye thy conscience that thou art received to mercy / and santyfyed in
Christ's passions and sofferinges / and shallt here after whyth all them that
follow God / receave the reward of erernalllyfe

Of thy words thou shall be iustyfyed and of thy words thou shall be
condemned. Math. xij. That is thy words as well as other deades shall testifye
with the or against the at the day of iudgeme^te. Many there are which abstain
from y^ vttewarde deades of fornicacio^ and adultery / never the less re^oise
to tal^e there of and laugh there words and laughter restifie against the^ / yt
there heart is vnpure / and they advlterers and fornicatours in the sight of
God* The tongue and oder signs of times utter ye malice of ye heart / though a
man for many causes abstain his ho^de / from y^ owteward dead or act.

If thou wylt enter in to life keep the commandments Mathei. xix. First
remember that when God commands us to do onie thing / he does it not
therefore / because that we of ourselves are able to do that he co^ma^deth /
but that be the law we myghtse and know our horrible da^nacio^ and captivity
under sin and should / repent and come to Christ / and receave mercy and the
spryte of god to loose us / stre^gh us and to make us able to do gods will
which is y^ law. Now when he says if thou will enter i^ to life keep the
co^mandeme^tes / is as much to say / as he yt keeps the co^ma^deme^tes is
intred in to life / for except a man have first the sprite of life in him by
Christ's purcheasinge / it is impossible for him to keape the comma^deme^tes /
or that his heart should be loose or at lybertye to lust after them / for of
nature we are enemies to the law of God.

As towching yt Christ says after ward if thou will be perfect / go and
sell thy substance and geve it to the pore he says it not as who should say
yt there were any gretter perfection the^ to keep the law of God (for that is
all perfection) but to show y^ other his bli^dnes which saw not that the law
is sprituall and requires y^ heart. But because he was not knowi^g that he had
hurt any man with the outward dead / he supposed yt he loved his neighbor
as him self. But when he was bade to show the deades of love / and geve of
his abu^da^ce to the^ that neaded / he departed morninge. Which is an evide^t
toke^ that he loved not his neyboure as well as him self. For if he had need
him self / it would not have greaved him to have received succor of an other
man* Moreover he saw not that it was morther and thef^e that a man should have
abondaunce of riches lying by him and not to show mercy therewith / and kindly
to succoure his neighbors neade. God has ge^e^ one man riches to help an other
at neade. If thy neighbor neade and thou help him not being able thou with
holdyst his duty from him and art a thief before God.

That also that Christ says / how yt it is harder for a rich man (which
loves his riches so that he can not find in his heart liberally and freely to
help the pore and neady) to enter in to the kingdom of heven / then a camel
to goo through the eye of an nedle / declares y^ he was not intred in to the
kingdom of heve^ / that is to say / eternal life. But he y^ keeps the
commandments is intred i^ to life / ye has life and the sprite of life in
him

THis ki^de of devyls goes not out but by prayere and fasting. Math. xxvij.
Not that the devil is cast out by merytes of fasting or prayinge. For he
says before yt for there vnbelefes sake they could not cast hi^ out. It is
fayeth no doubt y^ casts out the devils and faith it is yt fasteth and
prays. Faith has the promyses of God where unto she cleveth / and in all
things thursteth the honor of God She fasteth to suddue the body unto the
^prite that the prayer be not let / and that the sprite may quyetly talk with
God: she also when so ever oportunyte is geven prays god to fulsyll his
promyses unto his praise and glory. And God which is merciful in promysinge
and true to fulfill them / casts out the devils and does all that faith
des^reth and satysfyeth her thurst.

^Ome ye blessed of my father / enhrere the kingdom prepared for you / from
the beginning of the world. For I was a thurst and ye gave me dri^ke. and cet.
Mat. xxv. Not that a man with works deserves eternal life as a work man or
labourer his hyre or wages. Thou read in the text that the ki^gdome was
prepared for us from the begi^ninge of the world. And we are blessed and
santyfyed. In Christ's blood are we blessed from that bitter curse and damnable
captyuyte under sin / where in we were borne and conceaved. And Christ's
spryte is poured in to us / to bring forth good works / and our works a^ the
fruits of the sprite / and the kingdom is the deservinge of Christ's blood /
and so is faith and the spyrite and good works also. Not wythstondinge the
kingdom foloethw good works / and good works testyfye that we are heirs there
of / and at the day of Indgeme^t shall they testyfye for the elect unto their
comfort and glory / And to the confucyo^ of the ungodly vnbelevyng and
faythlesse sinners / which had not trust in y^ word of Gods promyses nor
lust to the will of God: but were carried of the sprite of there father the
devil unto all abhominacion / to work wy^kednes with all lust delectacion and
gredines.

MAny sins ar forgeve^ her for she loves much Lu. vij. Not yt love was cause
of forgevenes of sins. But contrary wise ye forgevenes of sins caused love
/ as it foloveth / to who^ less was forgeve^ / yt sameloveth less. And before
he co^me^ded the judgment of Simon / which answared that he loves most to
who^ most was forgeuyn: and also said at the last / thy faith has saved the or
made y^ safe / go in peace. We can not love except we se some benefete and
kyndnes. As long as we look on the law of God only where we se but sin and
damnacyon and the wrath of God apo^ us / ye where we were damned before we were
borne / we can not love God: No we can not but hate hi^ as a tyrante
unrighteous and unjust / and fle from him as did Cayn. But when the Gospel
that glad tidi^ges and ioifull promises are preached how that in Christ god
loves us first / forgeveth us / and has mercy on us / the^ love we again
and the deades of our love declare our faith. This is the manner of speaking /
As we say. Somer is nigh / for the treys blosome. Now is the blosominge of the
treys nor the cause that somer draws nigh / but ye drawing nigh of somer cause
of the blosomes / and the blosomes put us in remembrance that somer is at
hand. So Christ here teaches Simon by the ferve^tnes of love in the outewarde
deades ^o se a strong faith within whence so great love springs. As the
manner is to save do your charity / show your charity / do a dead of charity
/ show your mercy do a dead of mercy / meaning there by / that our deades
declare how we love our neighbors and how much we have compastion on them at
there neade. Moreover it is not possible to love except we se a cause. Except we
se in our hertes the love and kyndnes of God to us ward in Christ our lord /
it is not possible to love God a right.

We say also he yt loves not my dog loves not me. Nor that a man should
love my dog first. But if a man loved me the love where with he loves me /
would compel hi^ to love my dog / though the dog deserved it not / ye
though the dog had done hi^ a displaisure. yet if he loved me / ye same love
would refrain him from venging him self / and eause him to refer the
ve^geau^ce unto me. Soch sp^akinges find we in scripture. Ihon in the forth of
his first pistle says / he that says. I love God / and yet hates his brother
is a liar. For how ca^ he that loves not his brother whom he seith / love god
whom he seyth not? It Is is not spoken that a man should first lore his brother
and then God / but as it folowith. For this commandment have we of him / that
he which loves God should love his brother also. To love my neighbor is the
commanndement / which commandment he that loves not / loves not God. They
kepinge of the commandment declares what love I have to God. If I loved God
purely / no thing that my neighbor cowld do were able to make me either to
hate him either to take vengeaunee on him my self / seeing that god has
commanded me to love him / and to remitte all vengeance unto him. Mark now
how much I love the commandment / so much I love God how much I love God / so
much beleve I that he is merciful / kind and good / ye and a father unto me
for Christ's sake / how much I beleve that God y^ merciful unto me / and that
he woll for Christ's sake fulfill all his promises unto me: so much I se my
sins / so much do my sins greve me / so much do I repent and sorrow that I
sin / so much displeases me that poison that moves me to sin / and so
greatly desire I to be healede. So now by the natural order first I se my
sin. Then I repent and sorrow. The^ beleve I Gods promises / that he is
merciful unto me and forgeveth me / and will heal me at the last: then love I
and then I prepare my self to the commandment.

THis do and thou shall lyve Luc. x. that is to say / love thy lord God with
all thy heart / with all thy soul / and with all thy strengh / and with all thy
mind / and thy neighbor as thy self. As who should say / if thou do this /
or though thou can not do it / yet if thou fealest lust there unto / and thy
sprite sigheth morneth / and longs after strength to do it / take a sign and
evident token thereby that the sprite of life is in the / and that thou art
elect ^o life everlastinge by Christ's blood / whose gift and purchase is thy
faith and that sprite that works the will of God i^ the / whose gift also are
thy deades or rather the deades of the spirit of Christ and not thine / and
whose gift is the reward of eternal life which follows good works.

It follows also in the same place of luc. when he should depert / he plucked
ou^.ij. pe^ce / and gave them to the host / and said unto him Take the charge
or cure of him / and whatsoever thou spendest more I will recompense it the at
my cominge again. Remember this is a parable / and a parable may not be
expounded word by word. But the intent of the similitude must be sought out
only in the whole parable. The intent of the similitude is to show to whom a
man is a neighbor or who is a man's neighbor (which is both one) and what it
is to love a ma^s neighbor as him self. The Samaritane help him and showed
mercy as long as he was present / and when he cowld be no longer present / he
left his monye behind him. And if that were not sufficient / he left his
crede^s to make good the rest / and forsook him not / as long as the other had
neade Then said Christ go thou and do like wise / that is / without difference
or respection of persons who so ever neadeth thy help / him count thy
neighbor / and his neyboure be thou and show merci on hi^ as long as he
neadeth thy soccoure / and that is to love a man's neyboure as him self.
Neighbor is a word of love and signefieth that a man should be ever nigh and
at hand and ready to help in time of neade.

They that will enterpret parables word for word fall in to straytes often
times / whence they can not rid the^ selfs. And preach lies in stead of the
truth. As do they which e^terpret by the two pence the old testament and the
new / and by that which is bestowed / Opera supereroga^ionis. How beit
superarogancia were a meter term. That is to say / deades which are moare
then ye law requires / deades of perfection and of liberalite / which a man
is not bownde to do / but of his fre will. And for the^ he shall have a^ heyer
place in heve^ / and may give to other of his merits: or of which ye pope
after his death may gyve pardons* from the pains of purgatory.

Against which exposicio^ I answer. First a gretter perfection tha^ the law /
is there not. A gretter perfection the^ to love God and his will / which is the
commandments / with all thine heart / with all thy soul / with all thy
strength / with all thy mi^de / is there none. And to love a ma^s neiboure as
hi^ self / is like y^ same. It is a wonderful love where with a man loves him
self. As glad as I would be to receave pardon of mine own life (if I had
deserved deeth) so glad ought I to be to defend my neybours life whith out
respect of my life / or of my good. A man ought nether to spare his goods nor
yet hi^ sylf for his brothers sake / after the ensample of Christ.i. John. iij.
Here in says he / perceave we love / in that he (that is to say Christ) gave
his life for us. We ought therefore to bestow our lives for the brethren. Now
says Christ Johan.xv. there is no gretter love than that a man bestow his
life for his friend.

More over no man ca^ fulfill the law. For (Ihon says.i. Chapter of the said
pistle) if we say / we have no sin / we deceave our selves and truth is not
i^ us. if we knowleage our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgeve us
our sins / and to purge us from all iniquite. And in y^ pater noster also we
say father forgeve us our sins. Now if we be all sinners / none fulfilleth
ye law. For he that fulfilleth y^ law is no sinner. In the law may another
Peter nor Paulener any other creature save Christ only rejoice. In the blood
of Christ which fulfilled y^ law for us may every parson that repents
bileveth / loves the law and morneth for stre^gh to fulfill it rejoice / be
he never so weak a sinner. The two pence therefore and the creed n^ that he
left behind him / to bestow more if neade were / signefieth that he was every
where merciful / both present and absent / with our fayni^ge / cloking /
co^playni^ge / or excusinge and forsook not his neyboure as long as he had
neade. Which exemple I pray God men may follow and let / opera
superrogationis a lone

MAry has chosen a good part which shall not be taken from her. Lucc. x. She
was first chosen of God and called by grace / both to know her sin / and
also to hear the word of faith health and gladtidinges of merci in Christ and
faith was gyve^ her to beleve and y^ sprite of God loosed her heart from the
boundage of sin. Then consented she to the will of God again / and above all
things had delectacyon to hear yt word wherein she had obtained everlasting
health / and namely of his mouth which had purchased so great mercy for her God
choseth us first and loved us first and opineth our eyes to se his eyceading
abundaunt love to us in Christ / and then love we again and accept his will
above all things / and serve hi^ in that office where unto he has chosen us.

Selle that ye have and gyve alms. And make you bags which wax not old / and
treasure which fails not / in heven Lu. xij. This and soch like are not
spoken that we should work as hyrelinges in respect of reward / and as though
we should obtain heven with merit. For he says a little before / fear not
little flock for it is your fathers playsure to gyve you a kingdom. The
kingdom comes then of the good will of Almighty God thorove Christ. And soch
things are spoken partly to put us in remembrance of our duty to be kind
again. As is that saye^ge lat your light so shine before me^ that they se your
good works and gloryefye your father which is in heven. As who should seye / if
God has geve^ you so great gifts se ye be not unthankful / but bestow the^
unto his praise. Some things ar spoken to move us to put our trust in God / as
ar these. Behold y^ lyllyes of the feld. Behold the briddes of y^ heir. If your
childerne ask you bred will ye profer them a stoon? and many soch like. Some
ar spoken to put us in remembrance to be sober / to wache and pray / and to
prepare our selfs against te^ptatyons / and that we should understand and
know / how that te^tacions and occasyon of evell come then most / when they
are lest looked for: lest we should be careless and sure of ourselves /
neclygent / and unprepared. Some things ar spoken / that we should fear the
wonderful and incomprehensible judgments of God lest we should presume. Some
to confort us that we despair not. And for like causes ar all the ensamples of
ye old testament. In conclusion the scripture speaks many things as the
world speaks. But they may not be worldly understood / but goostlye and
spirituallie / ye the spryte of God only understands the^ / and where he is
not there is not ye understanding of the scripture. But unfruitful disputynge
and braulinge about words.

The scripture says / God sees / God hereth God smells / God walks / God
is with the^ God is not with the^ / God is angrye / God is pleased / God
sends his spirit / God takes his sprite away / and a thousand soch like.
And yet is non of the^ true after ye worldly manner and as the words sound.
Read the second Chapter of Paul to the Corinthians / the natural man
understands not the things of God / but ye sprite of god only and we (says
he) have received the sprite which is of God / to understand ye things which are geve^ us of god. For without the sprite it is i^possible to understand
the^. Read also the.viij. to the Romans They that are leed with the sprite of
God / are the sons of God. Now the son knows his fathers will and the
serva^t not he that has not the sprite of Christ (says Paul) is none of
his. Likewise he that has not the sprite of God is none of Gods / for it is
both one sprite / as thou may se in the same place.

Now he that is of God / hereth the word of God Jo. viij. and who is of God
but he that has the sprite of God. Forther more / says he ye hear it not /
because ye are not of God / that is / ye have no lust in the word of God / for
ye understood it not / and that because his sprite is not in you.

For as much then as the scripture is no thige else but that which ye sprite of
God has spoken bithe Prophets and Apostles / and can not be understand but
of the same sprite: Let every man pray to God to send him his sprite to loose
us from our natural blindness and ignorance / and to geve us understanding and
fealinge of y^ things of God and of the speakinge of the sprite of God. And
mark this process. First we are damned of nature / so co^ceaved and borne / as
a serpent is a serpent / and a tode a tode and a snake a snake by nature. And
as thou seyst a yo^g child / which has playsure in many things where in is
present deeth / as io fire / water and so forth / would slay him self with a
thowsande dethes / if he were not waited upon and kept therfro. Eve^ so we / if
we should lyve this thousand years could in all that time delight in no other
thing nor yet seek any other thing / but that where in is deeth of the soul.

Secu^darily of the hole multitude of the nature of man / who^ God has elect
and chosen and to who^ he has appointed mercy and grace in Christ / to the^
sends he his sprite / which opens there eyes / shows the^ there miserye /
and bri^geth the^ unto the knowleage of them selves / so that they hate and
abhor the^ selves / are a stonyed and amassed and at there wits e^des /
nether wott what to do or where to seek health. The^ lest they should flee from
God by desperacion / he comforts the^ again with his sweet promises in
Christ and certifyeth there hertes that for Christ's sake they are received to
mercy and there sins forgeven and they elect and made the sons of god and
heirs with Christ of eternal life: and this through faith ar they set at
peace with God.

Now may not we axe why god choseth one and not a^ other / other think that
God is unjust to damme us before we do any actual dead / seeing that God has
power over all his creatures of right / to do with them what he list or to make
of every one of them as he lists. Our darkness cannot perceave his light. God
will be fered and not have his secret judgments known. More over we by the
light of faith se a thousand things which are impossible to an infidle to se.
So like wise no doubt in the light of the clear vision of God we shall se
things which now God will not have known. For paid ever accompanyeth hye
knowleage but grace acco^panyeth mekenes. Let us therefore gyve dylygence rather
to do the will of God / then to search his secrettes which are not profitable
for us to know.

When we are thus reconsyled to God / made the friends of God and heirs of
eternal life / the sprite that God has powered in to us testyfyeth that we may
not lyve after our old deades of ignorance. For how is it possible / that we
should repent and abhor them / and yet have lust to lyve in them. We are sure
therefore that God has created and made us new in Christ / and put his spryte
in us that we should lyve a new life / which is the life of good works.

That thou may know what are good works / or what works are good and the
end and ente^te of good works / or wherefore good works serve / mark this
that foloveth.

The life of a Christen man is inward between him and God / and properly is
the consent of the sprite to the will of God / and to the honor of god. And
gods honor is the fynall end of all good works.

Good works ar all things yt are done with in the laws of God / in which God
is honored and for which thanks are geve^ to God.

Fasti^ge is to abstain from surfeti^ge or over much eati^ge / from dro^kenes
and care of the world (as thou may reed Lu. xxj.) and the end of fasting
is to ^ame the body / that the sprite may have a free course to God / and may
quyetly talk with God. For over much eatinge and drinkinge and care of worldly
business press down the sprite / choeke her and ta^gle her that she can not
lift up her self to God. Now he that fasteth for any other entenre than to
subdue the body / that the sprite may wayre on God / and freely exercice her
self in the things of God: the same is blind and worteth nor whit he does /
erreth and shoteth at a wrong mark / and his entente and vinagynacyo^ is abho
mynable in the sight of God. When thou fastest from mea^^ and druikest all day
/ is that a Christen fast* either to eat at one meal that were sufficient for
four. A man at four times may bear that he can not at ones. Some fast from
meat and drink / and yet so tangle the^ selves in worldly busynes that they
can not ones think on God. Some abstain from butter / some from eggs / some
from all manner whitte meat / some this day / some that day / some in the
honor of this saint / some of that / and every man for a sundry purpose. Some
for the toth ache / some for the head ache / for fevers / pestelence / for sode^
death / for hanginge / drounding / and to be delyverde from the pains of hell.
Some are so mad that the fast one of the thursdayes between the two saint marye
days in the worship of that saint whose day is hallowed between cristenmas and
candelmas / and that to be delyverd from the pestilence. All those men fast
without conscience of God / and without knowleage of the true entente of
fasting / and do no other than honor saints as the gentyles and heathen
worshipped / there ydolles / and ar drowned in blyndnes and know not of the
testament that God has made to manwarde in Christ's blood. In God have they
another hope nor confydence / nether beleve his promyses nether know his will /
but ar yet in captyvyte under they prince of darkness.

Watch is not only to absteyne from sleep / but also to be circu^spect and to
cast all perels: as a man should watch a toure or a castle. we must remember yt
the snares of y^ devil ar infinite and innumerable / and that every moment
arise new te^ptacions and that in all places mere us fresh occasions. Against
which we must prepare ourselves / and turn to God / and complain to him / and
make out moan / and desire him of his mercy to be our shylde / our toure / our
castle and defense from all vill / to put his strength in us (for without him
we can do naught) and above all things we must call to mind what promises God
has made / and what he has sworn yt he will do to us for Christ's fake /
and with strong faith cleve unto the^ / and desire him of his mercy and for
the love that he has to Christ / and for his truths fake to fulfill his
promyses. If we thus cleve to God with strong faith / and beleve his words:
then (as says Paul.j. Corint. x.) God is faithful / that he will not suffer
us to be tempted above that we are able or a above our might that is to say / if
we cleve to his promyses and nor to our fantasyes and ymagynacyons / he will
put might and power in to us / that shall be stronger the^ all the te^ptacyon
which he shall suffer to be agenst us.

PRayer is amornynge a longinge and a desire of the sprite to godward for yt
which she lacks / as a sick morneth and foroweth i^ his heart lo^gi^ge for
health. Faith ever prays. For after y^ by faith we are reco^siled to god and
have received mercy and forgivenes of god the sprite longs and thursteth for
strength to do ye will of God / and yt god may be honored / his name halowede
/ and his pleasure and will fulfilled. The sprite waits and watcheh on ye
will of god and ever has her awen fragilite and weakness before her eyes / and
when she sees te^tacio^ and perell draw nie / she torneth to God and to the
testame^te yt God has made to all that beleve and trust ^ Christ's blood and
desires God for his mercy / truth and for the love he has to Christ / yt he
woll fulfill his promise / y^ he will soc^re and help and give us strength /
and yt he woll sanctify his name in us and fulfill his godly will in us / and
that he will not look on our sin and i^iquite / but on his mercy / on his
truth / and on ye love that he owes to his sone Christ and for his sake to
keep us from te^tacion / that we be not overco^me and that he delyver us from
evil / and what so ever moves us contrary to his Godly will.

More over of his own experience he fealeth other men's neade / and no less
co^me^deth to God y^ infirmites of other the^ his own knowinge that there is no
strength / no help / no succure but of God only. And as merciful as he
fealeth god in his heart to hi^ self ward / so merciful is he to other / and
as greatly as he fealyth his own misery / so gretre co^passio^ has he on
other. His neiboure is no less care to bi^ then hi^ self. He fealeth his
neighbors greffe no less the^ his own. And when so ever he sceth occasion he
ca^ not but pray for his neyboure as well as for hi^ self: his nature is to
seek ye honor of god i^ all me^ / and to draw (as much as in hi^ is) all me^
unto god. This is y^ law of love which sprigeth out of Christ's blood i^ to
ye hertes of all the^ yt have there trust i^ hi^. No man neadeth to bid a
creste^ man to pray if he se his neybours neade: if he se it not put hi^ in
remembrance only / and the^ he ca^ not but do his duty.

Now as towchi^ge we desire one another to pray for us / yt do we to pur our
neibour in remembrance of his duty and not yt we trust i^ his holiness. Our
trust is in god / in Christ and in y^ truth of gods promises / we have also
a promise yt when.ij. 02. iij. or more agree together in any thing acordi^ge to
ye will of god / god hears us. Not withsta^di^g as god hears many so
hears he few / and so hears he one / if he pray after y^ will of god and
desire the honor of god. He y^ desires mercy / y^ same fealeth his* own
miseri / and sine and morneth i^ his heart for to be delyverd / that he might
honor God and God for his truth must hear him / which says by he mouth of
Christ Mat. v. Belssed ar they yt honger and thurst after righteousness / for
they shall be fufylled. God for his truethes sake must put ye righteousness of
Christ in hi^ and was he his unrighteousness away in ye blood of Christ. And
be ye sinner never so weke / never so feable and frail / sin he never so often
and so grevous / yet so long as this lust desire and inorninge to be delyuerd
remains in him. God sees not his sins / rekeneth the^ not / for his
truethes sake and love to Christ. He is not a sinner in the sight of God / yt
would be no sinner. He yt would be delyuerd has his heart loose all readi. His
heart sins not / but morneth repents / and co^senteth unto y^ law and will
of God and iustyfieth God / yt is / bears record that God which made ye law
/ is righteous and just. And soch an heart trustinge in Christ's blood / is
accepted for full righteous. And his weakness / infirmite and fraylte is
pardoned and his sins not lokede upon: until God put moare strength in him
and fulfill his lust.

When the weak in the faith and inexpert in the mysteries of Christ desire us
to pray for the^ the^ ought we to lead the^ to the truth and promyses of God
/ and teach the^ to put there trust in the promises of God / in love that God
has to Christ and to us for his sake / and to strength there weke conscre^ces
/ shewinge and proving by y^ scripture / that as long as they follow the
sprite and resist sin it is impossible they should faule so depethat God
shall not pulle them up again / if they hold fast by ye anchor of faith having
trust and confidence in Christ. The love that God has to Christ is infinite /
and Christ did and suffered all things / not for hi^ self / to optaine
favor or ought else: for he had ever y^ full favor of God and was ever
lord over all things / but to reconsile us to God and to make vs^heyres with
him of his fathers kingdom. And God has promised / y^ who so ever calls on
his name shall never be confounded or ashamed To. ij. if y^ rightwes fall
(says the scripture) he shall not be broysed / y^ lord shall put his hand
under hi^. Who is righteous but he yt trusts in Christ's blood / be he never
so weke? Christ is our righteousness and in him ought we to teach all men to
trust / and to expound unto all men y^ testament that God has made to us
sinners i^ Christ's blood. This ought we to do and not make a pray of them to
lead them captyve / to sit^e in there conscyences and to teach them to trust in
our holiness / good deades and prayers / to the intent that we would f^de our
idle and slow belyes of there great labor and sweat / and so to make
ourselves Christ's and saviors. For if I take o^ me to save other by mi
merits / make I not my self a Christ and a savioure / and am in dead a
false prophet and a true antichrist / and exalt my self and sytt in the temple
of God / that is to were the consciences of me^^

Among Christen men love makes all things commune: every man is others
detter and every man is bound to minister to his neighbor / and to supply
his neighbors lack / of that where with God has endued him. As thou seyst in
ye world how the lords and officers minister peace in y^ common wealth /
punnysh murderers / theves and evyll doers / and to maynttene there order and
ese ate do the co^munes minister to the^ again re^t / tribute / toll and
custom So in ye Gospel the curates which in every parish preach y^ Gospel
ought of duty to receave an honest living for the^ and their howfholdes and
even so ought y^ other officers which are necessarilye required in ye common
wealth of Christ. We neade not to use filthy lucre in the Gospel / to chope
and change and to play ye tavernars / alteringe ye word of God / as they do
there mines to their most avauntage / and to fascion Gods word aftyr every
ma^s mouth / or to abuse the name of Christ to obtain thereby autorite and
power / to feed our flow belyes. Now seyst thou what prayerys / the end
thereof and wherefore it seruyth.

If thou give me a thousand pownde to pray for the I am no more bound then I
was before. Man's ymaginacion can makethe commandment of god nether greater
nor smaller nether can to ye law of God exther add or minishe. Gods
commandment is as great as him self. I am bownde to love y^ Turk with all my
might and power / yet and above my power even from y^ ground of my heart /
aftyr the ensample y^ Christ loved me / nether to sp^re goods / body or life
to win him to Christ. And what can I do moare for y^ if thou gave me all y^
world? Where I se neade there can I not but pray if Gods sprite be in me.

Alms is a greake word and signifies mercy One Christian is detter to an
other at his neade of all yt he is able to do for hi^ vntill' his neade be
suffised. Every Christian man ought to have Christ all ways before his eyes / as
an ensample to counterfaite and follow / and to do to his neyboure as Christ
has done to hi^ / as Paulteacheth in all his pistles and Peter in his first
and John in his first also. This order uses Paul in all his pistles. First he
preaches ye law and proves yt the whole nature of man is damnyd in that y^
heart lusts contrary to y^ will of God. For if we were of God / no dowe we
should ha / ve lust in his will. The^ preaches he Christ / y^ Gospel ye
promises / and the mercy yt God has set forth to^ all men in Christ's blood.
Which they that beleve and take it for an ernest thing / turn the^ selves to
God / begin to love God again / and to prepare the^ selves to his will by y^
working of the sprite of God in the^. Last of all exorteth he to unite / peace
and sobernes / to avoyde beauli^ges / sects / opinions / disputinge and
arguinge about words / and to walk i^ the plain and syngle faith and
fealinge of y^ sprite / and to love one an other after y^ e^sample of Christ /
even as Christ loved us and to be tha^kfull / and to walk worthy of y^ Gospel
and as it becomes Christ and with the ensample of pure living to draw all to
Christ.

Christ is lord over all / and every criste^ is heir a^nexed with Christ and
therefore lord of all / and every one lord of what so ever an other has. If
thy brother on neiboure therefore neade and thou have to help hi^ and yet
showest not mercy but with drawest thy hands from hi^: the^ robbest thou hi^
of his own and art a these. A Christen man has Christ's sprite. Now is Christ
a merciful thing: if therefore thou be not merciful after ye e^sample of
Christ the^ have thou not his sprite. If thou have not Christ's sprite / then
art thou none of his To. viij. nor have any part with hi^. More over though
thou show mercy unto thy neibour / yet if thou do it not with soch burni^g
love as Christ did unto y^ / so must thou knowleage thy sin and desire mercy
in Christ. A criste^ man has naught to rejoice in / as co^cerninge his deades.
His reioysinge is yt Christ died for hi^ / and yt he is washed i^ Christ's
blood. Of his deades reioyseth he not / nether cou^teth his merits / nether
gives pardone of the^ / nether seeks a^ hyer place i^ eve^ of the^ / nether
makes hi^ self a savoure of other me^ / through his good works. But geveth
all honor to god / and i^ his greatist deades of mercy knowleageth hi^ self a
sinner unfeignedly / and is abu^da^tly co^te^t with y^ place yt is prepared for
hi^ of Christ. and his good deades ar to hi^ a sign only that Christ's sprite
is in him / and he in Christ / and through Christ elect to eternal life.

The order of love or charity which some dream / y^ Gospel of Christ knows
not of / that a man should begi^ne at hi^ self and serve hi^ self first and
the^ desce^de I wot not by what steps. Love seeks not her own profer.ij.
Cor. xij. but makes a man to forgette hi^ self / and to turn his profet to a^
other man / as Christ sought not hi^ self or his own profet but ours. This
term my self is not i^ y^ Gospel / nether yet father / mother sister /
brother / ki^sma^ / yt one should be preferred i^ love above a^ other. But
Christ is all i^ all things. Every christian man to an other is Christ him
self / and thy neigbours neade has as good right in thy goods as has christ
him self which is heir and lord over all. And look what thou owe to Christ
that thou owe to thy neybours neade. To thy neybour owe thou thine heart /
thy self and all that thou have and can do. The love that springs out of
Christ excludes ^o man nether puts difference between one and an other. In
Christ we are all of one degree without respect of persons. Not withstonding
though a Christian man's heart be open to all men / and receaveth all men. Yet be
cause that his abilite of goods extends not so far / this provisionis made
/ that every man shall care for his own howsehold / as father and mother and
thine elders that have helped the / wife chyldern and servantes. If thou
should not care and provide for thine howseholde / the^ were thou an infidele
/ saying thou have taken on the so to do / and for as much as that is thy part
committed to the of the congregation. When thou have done thy duty to thine
howsehold / and yet have forder abundance of the blessinge of God / that owe
thou to the pore that can not labre / or would labre and can get no work / and
are destitute of friends / to the pore I mean which thou know / to the^ of
thine own parysh. For that provision ought to be had in the congregation / that
every parysh ca^e for there pore. If thy neighbors which thou know be served
/ and thou yet have superfluyte / and hear* necessite to be among the
brethren a thousand mile of / to the^ art thou detter. Ye to the very
infidels we be detters / if they neade / as ferforth as we mayntene the^ not
against Christ or to blasfeme Christ. Thus is every man that neadeth thy help
/ thy father / mother / sister / and brother in Christ: even as every man that
does the will of the father / is father / mother / sister / and brother unto
Christ.

More over if any be an infidele and a falls Christen and forsake his household /
his wife / chylder and soch as ca^ not help them selves / then art thou bound
and thou have where with / eve^ as much as to thine own household. And they have
as good right in thy goods / as thou thy self. And if thou with draw mercy
from them / and have where with to help the^: then art thou a thief. If thou
show mercy / so doyst thou thy duty and art a faithful minister in the
household of Christ / and of Christ shall thou have thy reward and thank. Yff
the whole world were thine / yet has every brother his right in thy goods and
is heir with the / as we are all heirs with Christ. More over the rich and
they that have wisdom with the^ must se the pore set a work / that as many as
are able may feed them selves with the labor of there own hands /
according to the scripture and commandment of God.

Now seyst thou what alms dead means and wherefore it servith. Be that
seleth with his alms moare than to be merciful / to be a neybour / to succor
his brothers neade / to do his duty to his brother / to give his brother that
he owes him / the same is blind and sees not what it is to be a christen man
/ and to have fellowship in Christ's blood.

As partayning to good works / understand that all works ar good which are
done with in the law of God in faith and with thanks gevinge to god / and
understand that thou in doing them please God / what so ever thou doist
with in yt law of God / as when thou make water. And trust me if other wind
or water were stopped thou should feale what a preciouse thing it were to do
either of both / and what thanks ought to be geve^ God therefore. More over put
no difference between works / but what so ever cemeth in to thy hands that do
as time / place and occasion geveth / and as God has put the in degree hye or
low. For as ^witching to please God / there is no work better then an other.
God looks not first on thy work as y^ world does / as though the bewtysulnes
of the work pleased him / as it does the world or as though he had neade of
the^. But God looks first on thy heart / what faith thou have to his words /
how thou belevest him / trustest him and how thou love him for his mercy
that he has showed the he looks with what heart thou workest / and not what
thou workest / how thou acceptest the degree that he has put the in and not of
what degree thou art / whether thou be an Apostle or a show maker. Get this
ensample before thine eyes. Thou art a kehinpage and washest thy masters dyshes
/ an other is an Apostle and preaches the word of God. of this Apostle herfe
what Paul says in the second to the Corinthians.ix. If I preach (says he)
I have naught to rejoice i^ / for necessite is put unto me as who should say /
God has made me so. Woe is unto me if I preach not. If I do it wyllingly
(says he) the^ have I my reward that is / the^ am I sure that Gods spirit
is in me and that I am elect to eternal life. If I do it against my will an
office is committed unto me / yt is / if I do it not of love to God / but to
get a living there by and for a worldly purpos and had lever other ways lyve /
then do I that office which God has put me in and yet please not God my self.
No^e now if this Apostle preach not as many do not / which not only m^fe the^
selves Apostles / but also compel me^ to ^afe the^ for gretter the^ apostles /
ye for gretter the^ Christ hi^ self) the^ woe is unto him / yt is / his
damnacion is just. If he preach and his heart no^ right / yet mim^treth he ye
office that God has put him in / and they that have the spirit of god hear
the voice of God / ye though he speak in an Ass. More over how so ever he
preaches he has not to rejoice / in that he preaches. But and if he preach
willyngly / with a true heart and of conscience to God: then has he his reward
/ that is / the^ fealeth he the ernest of eternal life and the workinge of the
sprite of god in him. And as he fealeth Gods goodness and mercy / so be thou
sure he fealeth his own infir mite / weakness and unworthiness / and morneth and
knowleageth his sin / in that the heart will not arrise to work with that
full lust and lone that is in Christ our lord. And nevertheless is yet at
peace with God through faith and trust in Christ Jesus. For the ernest of ye
sprite that works in him testifies and bears wit nes unto his heart that
God has chosen hi^ / and that his grace shall suffice him / which grace is now
not idle in him. In his works puts he no trust.

Now thou that miuistrest in the kechen and art but a keche^ age receavist all
thing of y^ hond of God / know that God has put the in that office /
submutest thy self to hye will and servest thy master / not as a man / but as
Christ him self with a pure heart / according as Panle teaches us / put
thy trust in God / and* with him seakest thy reward. More over there is not a
good dead done / but thy heart reioyseth therein / ye when thou heareste that
ye word of God is preached by this Apostle and seyst the people turn to God /
thou consentest unto the dead / thine heart breaks out in joy / spri^geth
and leapeth in thy breast / that God is honored And in thine heart doist ye same
that ye Apostle does and happly with greater delecracio^ and a moare fervent
sprite. Now he yt receaveth a prophere in the name of a prophet shall receave
the reward of a prophet. Math. x. that is / he yt consents to ye deed of a
prophet and mainteneth it / the same has the same sprite and ernest of
everlasting life which the prophet has and is elect as the prophet is.

Now if thou compare dead to dead there is difference bitwixt / wasshinge of
disches and preaching of ye word of God. But as twitehinge to plaise God none
at all. For another yt nor this pleases / but as ferforth as God has chosen a
man / has put his sprite in hi^ and purifyed his heart by faith and trust in
Christ.

Let every man therefore wait on the office wherein Christ has put him and
therein serve his brethren. If he be of low degree let him pacyently therein
abide till God promote hi^ and exalte him hier. Let kings and head officers
seek Christ in there offices and ministre peace and quietres unto the brethren
/ punnish sin / and that with mercy / even with ye same sorrow and grefe of
mi^de as they would cut of a finger or ioynte a leg or harm of there own
body / if there were soch disease in the^ / that either they must be cut of
or else all the body must pereshe.

Let every man of what so ever craft or occupacion he be of / whether bruer
baker tailer vitailer merchant or husband man refer his craft and occupacion
unto ye common wealth / and serve his brethren as he would do Christ hi^
self. Let hi^ bye and sell truly and not set dice on his brether ne / and so
shows he merci / and his occupacio^ pleases God. And when thou receavest
money for thy labor or ware thou receavest thy duty. For wheri^ so ever thou
minster to thy brethren / thy brether are dettours to geve ye where with to
mai^tene thy self and thy household. And let your superfluires succoure ye pore
/ of which sort shall ever be some in all towns cities / and villages / and yt
I suppose y^ greayest nowmbre. Remember y^ we are me^bres of one body and ought
to minister one to an other mercifully. And remember yt what so ever we have /
it is gyve^ us of God to bestow it on our brethren. Let hi^ yt eats eat
and give God thanks / only let not thy meat poele thine heart from God. And
let hi^ yt drinks do like wise. Let hi^ yt has a wife gyve God thanks for
his liberty / only let not thy wife with draw thine heart from god and the^
please thou God and have ye word of God for the. And in all things look on
the word of God and there in put thy trust / and not in a visure / in a
dysgysed garment and a cut shwee.

Seek ye word of God in all things / and with out ye word of God do nothing
/ though it appear never so gloriouse. What so ever is done with out ye word
of God / yt count ydolatrie. The ki^gdome of heve^ is with in us. Luc. xvij.
Wonder therefore at no monstrous shapp ner at any outward thing with out ye
word. For the world was nerver drawn from God / but with an outward show and
glorious apperau^ce and shininge of ypocrysie and of fained and visured
fasting / prainge / watchinge / singing / offeringe sacryfycinge / halowi^ge
of supersticious ceremonies and monstrouse dysgysinge.

Take this for an e^sample. John baptist which had testimony of Christ and of
y^ Gospel / yt there never rose a gretter among wi^mens childern / with his
fasti^g / watchi^g / prai^g / raime^t and strait lyui^ge deceaved ye jews and
brought the^ in doubt / whether John were very Christ or not and yet no
scripture or miracle testifying it / so greatly ye blind nature of man looks
on y^ outeward shini^g of works / and regards not ye inward word which
speaks to ye heart. when they sent to John axige hi^ whether he ware Christ
/ he denied it. when they axed hi^ what he was and what he said of hi^ self. he
a^swared not / I am he y^ watches / prays / drinks no wine nor strong
drink / eateh another fysh nor flesh / but lyve with wild honey and grasshopers
and wear a cote of camels hear and a girdle of a sti^ne: but said I am a
voice of a criar. My voice only pertains to you. those outeward things which
ye wonder at / partaine to my self only unto y^ tami^ge of my body. To you am
I a voice only and y^ which I preach. My preachi^g (if it be received in to a
penitent or repe^ri^ge heart) shall teach you how to live and please god /
accordi^ge as god shall shede out his grace on every man. John preached
repe^tau^ce / saying prepare y^ lords way and make his paths straight The
lords way is repe^tau^ce and not ypocrisie of ma^s ymaginacio^ and inve^cio^.
It is not possible y^ y^ lord Christ should come to a man / eycept he know hi^
self and his sin and truly repent. Make his paths straight: y^ paths are
y^ law / if thou u^dersto^de it a right as god has give^ it. Christ says
i^.xvij. of Mat. Helias shall first come / y^ is shall come before Christ and
restore all things meani^ge of Io. bap. Io. ba. did restore y^ law and ye
scripture unto y^ right sense and vndersto^di^ge / which ye phariseis partly
had darkened and made of none effect / through there own traditions Matthew. xv.
where Christ rebukes the^ saying: whi tra^sgresse ye y^ commandments of god
thorou your tradicions: and partly had corrupt it with gloses and falfe
interpretacions / that no man could understand it. Wherefore Christ rebukes
the^ Math. xxiij. sainge: woe be to you pharisees ypocrites which shut up the
ki^gdome of heve^ before me^: ye enter not your selves / nether suffer the^
that come / to enter in: and partly did begile the people and bli^de there eyes
in disgisinge the^ selves / as thou read in y^ same.xxiij. Cha. how they
made broad and large philateries / and ded all there works to be seen of me^ /
y^ the people should wonder at there disgisinges and risuri^ge of them selves
other wise the^ god had made the^: and partly mocked the^ with ypocrisie of
f^lse holiness in fasti^ge / prai^ge and alms giui^g Mat. vj. and this did they
for lu^re to be i^ authorite / to sit in y^ co^scie^ces of people / and to be
counted as god hi^ self / yt the people should trust i^ there holiness and not
i^ god / as thou read i^ y^ place above rehearsed Mat. xxiij. woe be to you
phareses ypocrites which devour widows howses under a color of long prayer.
Counterfette therefore no thing without ye word of god when thou vndersto^dest
yt / it shall teach ye all things how to apply outward things / and where
unto to refer the^. Bewarre of thy good intent / good mind / good affection
or zele as they call it. Peter of a good mind and of a good affection or zele
chode Christ Math. xvj. be cause he said that he must go to Jerusalem and
there be slain. But Christ called him satan for his labor a name that
belongs to the devyll. And said that he perceaved not godly things but
worldly. Of a good intent and of a fervent affection to Christ the sons of
Zebedei would have had fire to come down from heven to co^sune ye Samaritanes
Lu. jx. But Christ rebuked the^ saie^ge y^ they wist not of what sprite they
were: yt is / that they understood not how y^ they were altogedre worldly and
fleshly minded. Peter smote malchus of a good zele: but Christ code^ned his
dead. y^ very Jews of a good ent^^e and of a good zele slew Christ and
persecuted ye apostles as Paull berith the^ record To. x. I bear the^ record
(says he) yt they have a ferve^te mi^de to god ward but not accordi^ge to
knowelege. It is a another thing the^ / to do of a good mind and to do of
knowledge: Labor for knowledge y^ thou may know gods will and what he would
have y^ to do Our mi^de ente^te and affection or zele are bli^de and all yt
we do of the^ is damned of god / and for y^ cause has god made a testame^te
between hi^ and us where i^ i^ contained both what he would have us to do / and
what he would have us to axe of hi^. Se therefore y^ thou do no thing to plaise
god with all but y^ he commands / nether axe any thing of hi^ but y^ he
has promised the. The Jews also (as it appears Act. vij) slew Steve^ of a
good zele. Because he proved by the scripture / that God dwells not in
churches or temples made with hands. The churches at the beginnynge were
ordained / that the people should thider resort to here the word of God there
preached only / and not for the use where in they now are. The temple wherein
God will be worshipped is the heart of man. For God is a sprite (says Christ Io.
iiij.) and will be worsheped in the sprite and in truth: That is / when a
penitente heart consents unto the law of god / and with a strong faith
lo^geth for the promises of God. So is God honored on all sides in yt we count
hi^ righteous in all his laws and ordinances and also true in all his
promyses. Other worshepinge of God is there none / except we make an ydole of
him.

IT shall be reco^pe^sed y^ at y^ risinge again of y^ rightewes Lu. xiiij. Read
y^ text before and thou shall perceave yt Christ does here yt same yt he
does Mathe. v. yt is he puts us i^ remembrance of our duty / yt we be to
ye pore as Christ is to us / and also teaches us how y^ we can never know
wether our love be right / and whether it spring of Christ or no as long as
we are but ki^de to the^ only which do as much for us again. But and we
bemercifull to y^ pore / for coscie^ce to God and of compassion and hertily
love / which compassion and love spring of y^ love we have to God in Christ
for y^ p^^e mercy and love yt he has showed on us: then have we a sure toke^ /
that we are be loved of God and waschen in Christ's blood and elect by
Christ's deservi^ge unto eternal life.

The scripture speaks as a father does to his young son / do this or yt
and the^ will I love y^ / yet the father loves his son first and studieth
with all his power and wit to overcome his child with love and with ki^dnes
to make him do yt which is comely honest and good for it self / A kind father
and mother love there chylder eve^ when they are evyll / yt they would shede
there own blood to make the^ better / and to bring the^ in to ye right way.
And a natural child studieth not to obtain his fathers love with works /
but considers with what love his father loves hi^ with all / and therefore
loves again / is glad to do his fathers will and studieth to beth ankefull.

The sprite of the world understands not y^ speakinge of God / nether y^
sprite of the wise of this world / nether y^ sprite of Philophers nether y^
sprite of Soerates / of Plato or of Aristoles Ethikes / as thou may se in ye
first and second chapter of the first to the Corint. Though yt many are not
ashamed to rail and blaspheme sainge / how should he understand the scripture
saying he is no philosopher nether has seen his metaphisike? More over they
blaspheme saienge how ca^ he be a devine and wotteth not what is subiectu^ i^
theologia? Never y^ less as a man with out y^ sprite of Aristotell or
philosophy / may by the sprite of God understand scripture: Eve^ so by the
sprite of God understands he yt God is to be sought in all the scripture /
and in all things and yet wotteth not what means Subiectu^ in theologia /
because it is a term of there own making. If thou should say to him that
has ye sprite of God / the love of God is the kepinge of ye commandments /
and to love a man's neyboure is to show mercy / he would with out arguinge or
disputinge understand / how that of the love of God springs y^ kepi^ge of
his commandments and of the love to thy neiboure springs mercy. Now would
aristotell deny soch speakinge / and a Duns man would make.xx. distintio^s. If
thou should say (as says sai^te John in the fourth of his pistle) how ca^
he yt loves not his neyboure whom he seith love God whom he seyth not?
Aristotell would say loo a man must first love his neyboure and the^ God and
out of the love to thy neyboure springs the love to God. But he yt fealeth
the workinge of the sprite of God / and also from what ve^igeaunce the blood
of Christ has delyverid him / understands how that it is impossible to love
other father or mother / sister / brother / neiboure / or his own sylfe a right
/ except it spring out of the love to God / and perceaveth that the love to a
man's neyboure is a sign of y^ love to God / as good fruit declares a good
tree / and that the love to a man's neyboure accompanies and follows the love
of God as heete accompanies and follows fire.

Like wise when the scripture says. Christ shall reward every man at y^
resurrection or vprisinge again accordi^ge to his deades / y^ sprite of
Aristotle's ethikes would say / loo with the multitude of good works may thou
/ and must thou obtain everlastinge life / and also a place in heve^ hye or
low accordi^ge as thou have many or few good works / and yet wotteth not what
a good work means as Christ speaks of good works / as he yt seyth not ye
heart / but outewarde things only. But he that has gods sprite u^dersto^deth
it. he fealeth yt good works ar no thing but fruits of love / co^passio^ /
mercyfulnes / and of a te^dernes of heart which a Christian has to his neiboure
/ and yt love spri^geth of yt love which he has to God / to his will and
commandments / and vndersto^deth also yt the love which man has to God
springs of y^ infinite love and botomelesse mercy which God in Christ showed
first to us / as says John in y^ pistle and Chap. above rehearsed. In this
(says he) appeared y^ love of God to us ward / because y^ god sent his only
begote^ son in to y^ world yt we might live through him. here i^ is love /
not yt we loved god / but yt he loved us / and sent^e his son to make a
greme^te for our sins. In co^clusio^ a Christian man fealeth that yt
u^speakeable love and mercy which God has to us / and yt sprite which works
all things yt are wroght according to y^ will of god / and that love where
with we love god / and yt love which we have to our neiboure / and yt mercy
and compassion which we show on hi^ / and also yt eternal life which is laid
up i^ stoere for us in Christ are all togeder y^ gift of God through Christ's
purchasinge.

If y^ scripture said always Christ shall reward y^ accordi^ge to thy faith
/ or accordi^ge to thy hope and trust thou have in god / or according to y^
love thou have to god and thy neiboure so were it true also as thou seist. ^.
Pe. i. receavi^ge y^ end or reward of your faith / ye health or salvacion of
your souls. But y^ spiritual things could not be known save by there works
/ as a tree can not be known / but by her fruit. how could I know yt I loved
my neiboure / if never occasion were give^ me to show mercy un to hi^? how
should I know yt I loved god / if I never suffered for his sake? how should I
know yt god loved me / if there were no infirmite / temptacion / perell and
Ieoperdye whence God should delyver me.

THere is no man that forsakes house / other father / or mother / other
brethren or sisterne / or wife / or chylderne for the kingedome of hevens sake
/ which shall not receave much moare in this world / and in the world to come
everlastinge life. Luc. xviij.

Here seyst thou that a Christen man in all his works has respect to
nothing / but unto y^ glory of God only and to the maynteni^ge of the truth
of God / and does and leveth ondone all things of love to the glory and
honor of god only / as Christ reaches in the pater noster. Moare over when he
says he shall receave much moare in this world / of a truth ye / he has
received much moare all ready. For except he had felt the infinite mercy /
goodness / love and kindness of God and the feloweshippe of the blood of Christ
and the comfort of y^ spirit of Christ in his heart / he could never have
forsaken anythynge for Gods sake. Notwithstondinge (as seyth Mark in the.x.
Chapter) Who so ever for Christ's sake and the Gospels forsakes house /
brethren or systers etc. He shall receave an hu^drede fold houses / brethren
etc. that is spiritually. For Christ shall be all things unto the. The angels /
all Christian and who so ever does the will of the father / shallbe father /
mother / sister and brother unto the / and all there shall be thine. And god
shall take the care of the and minister all things unto the / as long as thou
sekyste but his honor only. Moare over if thou were lord over all ye world /
ye of ten worlds before thou knewiste God: yet was not thine appetite
quenched / thou thurstodeste for more. But if thou seek his honor only / the^
shall he flake thy thirst and thou shall^e have all that thou desyrest / and
shall be content: ye if thou dwell among infideles / and emonge the most
cruelst nation of the world / yet shall he be a father unto the and shall
defend the / as he did Abraham / Isaac and Jacob and all saints whose lives
thou read in the scripture. For all that are past and gone before are but
ensamples to strength our faith and trufte in the word of God. It is the same
God and has sworn to us all that he swear unto the^ / and is as true as ever
he was and therefore can not but fulfill his promises to us as well as he did to
them / if we beleve as they did.

The honre shall come when all they that are in the graves shall hear his
voice / that is to say Christ's voice / and shall come forth / they that have
done good in to the resurtection of life and they that have done evyll in to
the resurrection of damnacion / Jhon.v. This and all like textes declare what
follows good works / and yt our deades shall testify with us or against us
at that day / and puts us in remembrance to be diligente and rervente in
doing good. Here by may thou not understand yt we obtain y^ favor of
God and the enheritannce of life through y^ merits of good works / as
hyrelinges there wages. For then should thou rob Christ / of whose fulness
we have received favor for favor Jo. i. that is Gods favor was so full in
Christ y^ for his sake he geveth us his favor / as affirms also Paul
Ephe. i. he loved us in his beloved by who^ we have (says Paul) rede^cion
through his blood / and forgevenes of sins. The forgevenes of sins the^ is
our redemcion in Christ / and not y^ reward of works. In whom (says he i^
the same place) he chose us before y^ making of ye world / that is long
before we did good works. Through faith in Christ ar we also ye sons of god
/ as thou readist Jo. i. in that they beleved on his name he gave them powere
to be the sons of God. God with all his fullnes and riches dwells i^
Christ / and out of Christ must we feach all things. Thou readist also Jo.
iij. he yt beleveth on the son has eternal life. And he yt beleveth not
shall se no life / but y^ wrath of god abides apo^ hi^. Here seist thou yt the
wrath and vengeance of god possesses every man till faith come. Faith and
trust i^ Christ expels ye wrath of god / and brings favor y^ sprite /
powere to do good and everlasting life. More over until Christ have geve^ y^
light thou knoweste not where in stondeth the goodness of thy works / and till
his sprite has lo ^sed thine heart thou canste not consent unto good works.
All yt is good in us both will and works comes of ye favor of God through
Christ to whom be the lawde Amen.

IF any man will do his will (he means the will of y^ father) he shall know
of y^ doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of my self. Jo. vij.
This text means not yt any man of his own strength powere and fre will (as
they call it) can do ye will of God / before he has received the sprite and
strength of Christ through faith. But here is meant yt which is spoken in the
thread of John when ^ecodemus marveled how it were possible that a man should
be borne again. Christ answered / that which is borne of ye flesh is flesh
and that which is borne of the spryte is spryte as who should say / he that
has the sprite through faith and is borne again and made a new in Christ /
understands the things of the sprite and what he that is spiritual means.
But he that is flesh and as Paul says.j. Corin. ij. a natural man and leed
of his blind reasou only / ca^ never asce^d to y^ capacite of ye sprite. And
he geveth an e^sample sai^ge / y^ wi^d blows where he lysteth and thou
hear his voice and wottest not whence he comes nor whyder he will. So is
every man that is borne of the sprite / he that speaks of ye sprite ca^ never
be understand of the natural man which is but flesh and savereth no more then
things of the flesh. So here means Christ if any man have ye sprite / and
co^senteth unto ye will of God / this same at ones wotteth what I mean.

IF ye understand these things / happy are ye if ye do them Joa^. xiij. A
criste^ man's heart is with ye will of God / with the law and co^manndementes
of God / and ho^greth and thursteth after strength to fullfyll the^ and morneth
day and night desyringe god according to his promises / for to geve him power
to fullfyll the will of God with love and lust: then restifyeth his dead that
he is blessed and that the sprite which blesses us in Christ is in him and
ministers soch strength. The outewarde dead testifies what is with in us /
as thou read Joan. v. The deades which I do / testify of me says Christ.
And Joa^. xiij. hereby shall all men know that ye are my disciples / if ye
love one an other. And Joa^. xiiij. he that has my commandments and keapeth
the^ the same it is that loves me. And again / he that loves me keeps my
commandments / and he that loves me not keeps not my commandments / the
outward dead testifyinge of the inward heart. And John.xv. If ye shall keep
my commandments ye shall continue in my love / as I keep my fathers
commandment and continue in his love. That is / as ye se y^ love that I have
to my father in that I keep his commandments / so shall ye se the love that
ye have to me in that ye keep my commandments.

Thou may not think that our deades bless us first and that we prevent God
and his grace in Christ / as though we in our natural gifts and being as
we were borne in Adam / looked on the law of God and of our own strength
fulfilled it and so became rightewes / and the^ with that rightewesnes obtained
the favor of God. As philosophers write of rightewesnes / and as the
rightewesnes of temporal law is / where the law is satisfied with the
ypocresie of the outward dead. For contrary to that readeste thou John.xv.
Ye have not chosen me (says Christ) but I have chosen you / that ye goo and
bring forth fruit / and that your fruit remain. And in ye same chapter. I am
a vine and ye the branches and with out me can ye do no thing. With us
therefore so goes it. In Adam ar we all as it were wild crabtres / of which
God choseth whom he will and plucketh them out of Adam and planteth them in
the garden of his mercy and stocketh them and graffeth the sprite of Christ
in them / which brings forth the fruit of the will of God / which fruit
testifyeth that God has blessed us i^ Christ. Note this also / that as long
as we lyve we are yet partly carnal and fleshly (notwithsto^dinge yt we are i^
Christ and though it be not imputed unto us for Christ's sake) for there
abides and remains in us yet of the old Ada^ as it were the stooke of the
crabtree / and ever emonge when occasion is gyven him / shoteth forth his /
branches and leves / buddde / blosome and fruit. Against whom we must fight
and subdue him and change all his nature by a little and a little / with prayer
fasting / watchinge / with vertnose meditacion and holy works / until we be
all together spryte. The kingdom of heve^ says Christ Math. xiij. is* like
leven which a woman takes and hydeth in.iij. peckes of meal till all
belevended. The leven is the sprite and we the meal which must be seasoned
with ye sprite a little and a little till we be through owre sprytuall.

Which shall reward every man according to his dead. Romans ij. that is
according as the deades are / so shall every man's rewar be / the deades
declare what we are / as the fruit the tree / according to the fruit shall the
tree be praised. The reward is gyven of the mercy and truth of God / and by
the deservinge and merytes of Christ. Whosoever repents / beleveth the
Gospel / and puts his trust in Christ's merytes / the same ye heir with
Christ of eternal life / for assurance where of the sprite of God is powered
in to his heart as an erneste / which louseth him from the bonds of Satan /
and gyveth him lust and strength every day more and more according as he is
diligente to axe of God for Christ's sake. And eternal life follows good
lyvinge. I suppose (says saint Paul in the same pystle the.viij. Chapter)
that the afflictyons of this world are not worthy of the glory which shall be
showed on us / yt is to say / that which we here suffer can never deserve that
reward which there / shall be gyve^ us.

Moare over if the reward should depend and hang of the works / no man
should be saved. For as much as our best deades / compared to the law / are
damnable sin. By the deades of the law is no flesh iustyfyed / as it is
written in the third Chapter to y^ Romans The law justifies not / but utters
the sin only and compels and dryveth the penitent or repentinge sinner to
fle unto ye seyntory of mercy in y^ blood of Christ. Also repe^te we never so
much / be we never so well willi^ge unto y^ law of God. Yet are we so weak /
and the snares and occasions so in numerable that we fall daily and hourly.
So that we could not but dispere / if the reward hanged of the work.
Whosoever ascribes eternal life unto the deservinge and merit of works /
must faule in one of two inconvenientes / either must he be a blind pharisey
not saying that the law is sprituall and he carnal / and look and rejoice in
the outewarde shinynge of his deades / despysynge the weke and in respect of
them Justify him self. Or else (if he se how that the law is sprituall and
he never able to ascend unto that which the law requires) he must neades
despere. Let every Christen man therefore rejoice in Christ our hope / trust
and rightewesnes / in whom we are loved / chosen and accept unto the
enheritaunce of eternal life / nether presumynge in our perfectnes / nether
desperinge in our weakness. The perfecter a man is / the clerer is his sight /
and seyth a thousand things which desplease him and also perfectenes that can
not be obtained in this life. And therefore desires to be with Christ / where
is no moare sin. Let him tharis weak and can not do that he would feign do
not despeare / but turn to him that is strong and has promised to geve
strength to all that axe of him in Christ's name / and complain to God and
desire him to fulfill his promises / and to God commit him self. And he
shall of his mercy and truth strength him and make him feale / with what love
he is beloved for Christ's sake / though he be never so weak.

THey are not righteous before God which hear the law / but they which do the
law shall be iustyfyed. Romano. ij. This rexte is playner than that it neadeth
to be expouned. In the chapter before Paul proves that the law natural
help not the gentyles. For the law of God was written in the hertes of the
gentyles (as it appears by the laws / statutes and ordinances which they
made inther cytes) yet kept they them not. The great keep the small under
forther own profette with the violence of the law. Every man prayseth the
law as fer forth as it is profitable and pleasant unto him self. But when
his awn appetites should be refrayned / then grudgeth he against the law. More
over he proves that no knowleage help the gentyles. For though the learned men
(as the philosophers) came to the knowleage of God / by the creatures of the
world / yet had they no power to worsheppe God. In this second chapter
proves he that the Jews (though they had the law written) yet is help them
not: they could not keep it / but were ydolaters and were also murderers /
adulters and what so ever the law forbade. He concludes therefore that the
Jew is as well damned as the gentyle. If hearing of the law only might have
justified / then had the Jews bin ryghteous. But it required yt a man do the
law / if he will be ryghteous. Which because the Jew did not / he is no less
damned then the gentyle. The publishinge and declaringe of the law does but
utter a ma^s sin / and geveth nether strength nor help to fullfylle the
law. The law kylleth thy conscience and geveth the no lust to fullfyll the
law. Faith in Christ geveth lust and power to do the law. Now is it true
that he which does the law is righteous / but that does no man save he that
beleveth and puts his trust in Christ.

IF any man's work that he has bylde upon abide / he shall receave a
reward.i. Corint. ij. The circumstance of the same Chapter / that is to were /
that which goes before and that which follows / declares plainly what is
mente. Paul talks of lerninge doctrine or peachinge. He says that he him
self has laid the fundacion / which is Jesus Christ: and that no man can
lay any other. He exhorts therefore every man to take head what he byldeth
upon / and boroweth a similitude of ye goldsmyth which tries his metalles with
fire saying that the fire (that is) the judgment of the scripture / shall
try every man's work / that is every man's preachinge and doctrine. If any byld
upon the fundaeyon laid of Paul / I mean Jesus Christ / gold sylver or
precious stoone / which are all one thing and signifye true doctrine / which
when it is examined the scripture aloweth / then shall he have his reward /
that is he shall be sure that his learning is of God / and that Gods spryt is
in him and that he shall have the reward that Christ has purchased for him.
On the other side if any man bylde there on tymbre / heye or stubble / which are
all one and sygnyfye doctrine of man's ymagenacyon / tradicyons and fantasyes
which stand not with Christ when they are examyned and judged by the
scripture / he shall sofre damage / but shall be saved him self / yet as yt were
through fire / that is / it shall be paynesull unto hi^ / that he has lost his
labor / and to se his byldinge perish / not wythstondinge if he repent and
enbrace the truth in Christ / he shall obtain mercy and be saved. But if
Paul were now a live and would defend his own lerni^ge / he should be tried
through fire / not through fire of y^ judgment of scripture (for that light
men now utterly refuse) but by the popes law and with fire of fagottes /

WE must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ / for to receave
every man acordinge to ye deades of his body.ij. Corin. v. As thy deades
testify of the so shall thy reward be. Thy deades be evyll / then is the
wrath of God upon the / and thine heart is evil and so shall thy reward be
if thou repent not. Fear therefore and cry to God for grace / that thou
may love his laws. And when thou love them cease not till thou have
optayned power of God to fullfyll them: so shall thou besure that a good
reward shall follow. Which reward not thye deades / but Christ's have
purchased for the / whose purchasinge also is that lust which thou have to
Gods law / and that might where with thou ^ullfyllest them Remember also /
that a reward is rather called that which is gyven freely / then that which is
deserved. That which is deserved / is called (if thou will gyve him his right
name) hyre or wages. A reward is gyven freely to provoke unto love and to make
friends.

Remember y^ what so ever good thing any man does / that shall he receave of
the lord. Ephesy. vj. Remembringe that ye shall receave of the lord the
reward of enheritance. Collossens. iij. These two textes are exceadingeplayne.
Paul. means as Peter does.j. Petr. ij. that servauntes should obey there
masters with all there hertes and with good will though they were never so
e^ill. Ye he will that all that are under powere obey / even of heart and of
conscience to God / be cause God will have it so / be the rulers never so
wicked. The chylderne must obeve father and mother be they never so cruel or
unkind / life wise the wife her husbonde / the servaunte his master / the
subjects and communes their lord or king. Why? For ^e scrve the lord says
he in the thryd to ye Coll. Wear Christ's and Christ has boughte us / as thou
read To. xiiij. j. Cori. vj. j. Peter. j. Christ is our lord and we his
possessyon / and his also is the commandment. Now ought not y^ crueluesse
and churleshnesse of father and mother / of husbonde / master / lord or king
/ cause us to hate the co^mau^deme^te of oureso kind a lord Christ. Which
spared not his blood for our sales which also has purchased for us with his
blood / yt reward of eternal life which life shall follow ye patience of good
levi^g and where unto our good deades testify yt we are chosen, Forthermoare
we are so carnal / that if the rulers be good / we can not know whether we
keep the commandment for ye love that we have to Christ and to God through
him or no. But and if thon can find in thine heart to do good unto him that
rewards the evyll again / then art thou sure that the same spirit is in the
that is in Christ. And it follows in the same chapter to the Collossiens. He
that does wrong shall receave for the wrong that he has done. That is God
shall avenge the abundantly / which seyth what wrong is done unto the and yet
sofereth it for a time / that thou myghtest feale thy pacyence and the workynge
of his sprite in the / and be made perfect. Therefore se that thou not once
desire vengeance but remitte all vengeance unto God as Christ did. Which
(Says Peter.i. Petri. ij.) when he was revyled / revyled not again / nether
thretned when he sofered. Unto such obedience / unto such pacyence / unto such
a pore heart / and unto such fealinge / is Paul's meaning to bring all men /
and not unto the vain dysputynge of them that ascrybe so hye a place in heven
unto there pylde merytes. Which as they feale not the workynge of Gods spryte
/ so obey they no man. If the fynge do unto them but right / they will
interdyte the hole realm / curse / excomunycate and send down fer beneth the
botome of hell / as they have brought the people out of there wits / and
made them madd to beleve.

THy prayers and alms ar come up in to remembrance in the presens of God. (in
the tenth Chapter of the Acts) That is God forgets the not / though he come
not at the first calling / he looks on and beholds thy prayers and alms.
Prayer comes from the heart. God looks first on the heart / and then on the
dead. As thou readist Genesis.iiij. God be held* looked first on Abell / and
then on his offering. If the heart be vnpure / the dead verily playseth not /
as thou seyst in Cayn. Mark the order. In the beginning of the chapter thou
read / there was a certain man named Cornelius which feared God / gave much
alms / and prayed God always. He feared God / that is he tre^blede and quakede
to break the commandments of God. The^ prayed he allwaie. Prayer is the
fruit effect / dead or act of faith and is no thige but the lo^gige of the
heart for tho things which a man lacks and which God has promised to geve
him. He does also alms. Alms is the fruit / effect or dead of compassion
and pity which we have to our neyboure. Oh a gloryouse faith and a right which
so tru^eth God and beleveth his promises / that she fears to break his
co^maundemenres and is also merciful unto her neyboure. This is that faith
where of thou read namely in Peter / Paul and John / that we are there by
both justified and saved. And who so ever ymageneth any other faith / deceaveth
him self and is a vain disputer and a b^auler a boute words / and has no
fealinge in his heart.

Though thou consent to the law / that it is good righteous and holy /
soroweste and repe^test because thou have broken it / mornest because thou have
no strength to fulfill it: yet art not thou there by at one with God. Ye thou
should shortly despair and blaspheme God if the promises of forgevenes and
of help were not there by / and faith in thine heart to beleve them. Faith
therefore sets the at one with God.

Faith prays allwaye. For she has allwaye her infirmites and weakneses
before her eyes / and also Gods promises / for which she always longs and in
all places. But blind unbelief prays not always nor in all places / but in
the church only / and yt in soch a church / where it is not lawful to preach
gods promises / nether to teach me^ to trust there in. Faith when she prays
sets not her good deades before hyrsayng: Lord for my good deades do this
or that. Nor bargeneth with God saying lord grant me this or do this or
that / and I will do this or yt for the / as mumble so much daily / goo so
far or fast this or that fast / enter in this religyon or that / with soch
other points of infidelyte / ye rather ydolatrye. But she sets her
infirmities and her lack before her face and Gods promyses saying: Lord for
thy mercy and truth which thou have sworn be merciful unto me / and pluck
me out of this prison and out of this hell. And loose the bonds of Satan and
gyve me power to glorifye thy name. Faith therefore iustifyeth in the heart and
before God / and the deades iustifye outewardly before the world / that is /
testifye only before men / what we are inwardly before God.

Who so ever lokes in the perfect law of liberty and continues there in (If
he be not a forgetful hearer but a do^r of the work) he shall be happy in his
dead. James.i. The law of liberty / that is / which requires a fre heart /
or (if thou fullfyll it) declares afre heart lowesed from the bonds of satan.
The preachinge of the law makes no man fre / but been death. For it is the keye
that byndeth all consciences unto eternal da^nacion / when it is preached: as
the promyses or Gospel is the keye ^ lowseth all consciences that repent when
they are bound through preachinge of ye law. He shall be happy in his dead /
that is / by his dead shall he know that he is happy and blessed of God
which has geve^ hi^ a good heart and power to fullfyll the law. By hearing
the law thou shall not know that thou art blessed but if thou do it / yt
declares that thou art happy and blessed.

WAs not Abraham justified of his deades / when he offered his son Isaac apo^
the altar? James.iij. his dead justified him before the world / that is / yt
declared and uttered the faith which both instifyeth him before God / and
wrought that wo^ derfull work as James also affermeth.

Was not Raab the harlo^t iustyfied when she received the messingers and sent
them on^e an other way? Jam.iij. that is like wise outewardly / but before God
she was justified by faith which wrought that outewarde dead / as thou may
se Josue.ij. She had herd what God had done in Egypt / in the redd see / in
the deserte / and unto the two kings of the Amorrea^s / Seon / and Og. And she
confessed seeing: your lord God / he is God in heven / above and in earth
benethe. She also beleved yt god as he had promised y^ chylderne of Israel
would gyve the^ the land where in she dwelt / and consented there unto /
submitted her self unto the will of God / and help God (as much as in her
was) and saved his spies and messingers. The other feared y^ which she beleved
/ but resysted God with all there might and had no power to submit the^ self
unto the will of God. And therefore perished they / and she was saved and that
through faith / as we read Hebre. xi. where thou may se how the holy fathers
were saved through faith / and how faith wrought in them. Faith is y^ goodness
of all ye deades y^ are done with in the law of god and makes the^ good and
gloriouse / seem they never so vile and unbelief makes the^ damnable seem they
never so glorious.

AS pertaninge to yt which James i^ this.iij. Chapter says. What avayleth though a
man say that he has faith / if he have no deades? ca^ faith save hi^? and
again. faith without deades is dead in it self. And y^ devils beleve and
tremble. And as y^ body without y^ spryte is deed / eve^ so faith without
deades is deed. It is manifest and clear yt he means not of y^ faith where
of Peter and Paul speak in there pistles / John in his Gospel and first
pistle / and Christ in the Gospel when he says / thy faith has made the
safe / be it to the according to thy faith / or great is thy faith and so
forth / and of which James him self speaks in the first Chapter saying: of
his own will begat he us whith the word of life / that is in belevi^ge the
promyses where in is life / are we made the sons of God.

Which thing I also this wise prove. Paul says / how shall or can they beleve
without a preacher? how should they preach / except they were sent? Now I
pray you when was it heard that God sent any man to preach unto the devyls /
or that he made the^ any good promise? He threatens them often / but never sent
ambassadors to preach any atonement between him and them. Take an ensample
that thou may understand. Let there be two pore men both destitute of
raymente in a cold winter / the one strong that he fealeth no grefe the other
grevously / morninge for pain of the cold. I then come by and moved with
pitye and compassion say unto him that fealeth his disease / come to soch a
place and I will gyve the raymente sufficient. he beleveth / comes / and
obtayneth that which I have promised. That other sees all this and knows it
/ but is partaker of naught. For he has no faith / and that is because there
is no promise made hi^. So is i^ of the devyls The devyls have no faith* For
faith is but ernest belevinge of Gods promyses. Now are there no promyses made
unto the devyls / but sore thretninges. The old Philosophers knew that there
was one God / but yet had no faith / for they had no powere to seek his will
nether to worship him. The turks and the saresons know that there is one
God / but yet have no faith. For they have no power to worship God in sprite
to seek his playsure and to submytte them unto his will. They made an ydolle of
God (as we do for the most part) and worshipped him every man after his own
ymagination and for a sundry purpose. What we will have done / that must God do
/ and to do our will worship we him and pray unto him: but what God will
have done that will another turk nor sareson nor the most part of us do. what
so ever we ymagyon rightheous / that must God admit. But Gods righteousness
/ will not our hearts admit Take an other ensample. Let there be two soch as
I speak of before and I promise both / and the one because he fealeth not his
disease comes not. So is it of Gods promyses. No man is help by them but
sinners that feale there sins / morn and sorrow for them and repent with
all there hertes. For John Baptiste went before Christ and preached
repentance / that is / he preached the law of God right / and brought the
people in to knowleage of the^ selves / and unto the fear of God / and then
sent them unto Christ to be healed. For in Christ and for his sake only has
God promised to receave / us unto mercy / to forgyve us and to give us power
to resist sin How shall god save the / when thou know not thye da^nacion?
How shall Christ deliver the from sin / when thou will not knoweleage thy
sin? Now I pray the how many thowsandes are there of them that say I beleve
that Christ was borne of a virgi^ / that he dyed / that he rose again and so
forth / and thou ca^ste not bring the^ in belefe / that they have any sin at
all? How many are there of the same sort which thou can not make beleve that
a thousand things are sin which god da^neth for sin all the scripture
through out? As to bye as good chepe as he ca^ / and to sell as dear as he
can / to raise the marker of corn and vitaile / for his own vauntage /
without respect of his neyboure or of the poere or of the common wealeh and
soch like. Moreover how many hu^drede thousands are there which when they have
sinned / and knowleage there sins: yet trust in a bald ceremonye or in a
lowf^e freris coete and merits or i^ the prayers of the^ yt devour widows
howses and eats ye pore out of house and herboure / in a thing of his own
ymaginacio^ / in a folishe dreme and a false vision / and not in Christ's
blood and in the truth that god has sworn? All these are fayth^lesse / for
they follow there own righteousness and are disobedie^te unto all manner
righteousness of god: both unto the righteousness of gods law where with he
da^neth all our deades (sor though some of the^ se there sins for fear of
pain / yet had ye lever y^ soch deades were no sin) and also unto ye
righteousness of y^ truth of god in his promises where by he says all y^
repe^te and beleve the^. For though ye beleve yt Christ dyed / yet beleve yt
not yt he dyed for there sins and that his deeth is a sufficie^te
satisfaccio^ for there sins / and that God for his sake will be a father unto
them and gere them powere to resist sin.

Paul says (to ye Romans i^ the.x. Chap.) if thou confess with thy mouth
that Jesus is the lord and beleve with hyne heart that God raised him up from
death / thou shalt be safe. That is if it thou beleve he raised hi^ up again
for thy salvacion. Many beleve that God is rich and almyghtye / but not unto
them selves and that he will be good to them and defend them and be there God.

Pharao for pain of ye plage was co^pellede to confess his sins / but had
yet no power to submit hi^ self unto ye will of god and to let the childer
of Israel goo and to loose so grette profet for Gods playsure. As our
prelates confess there sins saying: though we be never so evyll / yet have
we the power. And again / the scribes and the phareses (say they) sat in
Moses se ate / do as they teach but not as they do / thus confess they that
they are abhominabile. But to the second I answer / if they sat on Christ's
se are they would preach Christ's doctrine / now preach they their own
tradicions and therefore not to be herd. If they preached Christ we ought to
here them though they were never so abominable / as they of them selves
confess and have yet no power to amend nether to let lowese Christ's flocfe
to serve God in ye sprite which they hold captyve compellinge the^ to serve
their false lies. The devils felt the power of Christ and were compelled
against there wills to confess that he was the son of God / but had no
power to be conte^te there with nether to consent unto the ordinance and
eternal cowncell of the everlasti^ge God / as our prelates feale the pover of
God against the^ but yet have no grace to geve rowme unto Christ / because
that they (as the devils nature is) will the^ selves sit in his holy temple /
that is to wete / the consciences of men.

Simon magus beleved / Acts.viij. with soch a says as y^ devils confessed
Christ / but had no right faith / as thou seyst in the said chapter. For he
repented not consentinge unto the law of God. Nether beleved the promisto or
longed for the^ / but wondered only at the my racles which Philippe wroughte and
because that he him self in Philippes presence had no power to use his
wicheraste / sorcery and art magyte / wherewith he mocted and deluded the
wits of the peeple. he would have bought the gift of God to have sold it much
dearer / as his successors now do and not the succestoures of Simo^ peter. For
were they Symo^ Peter's successors / they would preach Christ as hedyd / but
they are Simon magusses successors of which Simon Peter well prophesied in the
second Chapter of his second Pistle saye^ge / there were falls prophets
among the people (meaning of the Jeves) eve^ as there shall be false teachers
or doctors among you / which pryvely shall bring in sects damnable (sects
is partetakinge as one holds of frau^ces another of dominyct which thing
also Paul rebukes.i. Corinthi. i. and.iij.) even denienge the lord that
bought them (for they will not be saved be Christ nether so fre any man to
preach him to other) And many shall follow there damnable ways (thou will say
shall God so fre so many to goo out of the right ways so long? I answer
many must follow their damnable ways or else must Peter be a falls prophet)
by which the way of truth shall be evyll spoken of (as it is now at this
present time. For it is heresye to preach the truth) and through co^etousnes
shall they with feigned words make merchaundyse of you / of their merchau^dyse
and covetousnes it neadeth not to make rehersall / for they that be blind se
it evidently.

Thus seyst thou that James when he says (faith without deades is deed / and
as the body without the sprite is deed / so is faith without deades / and the
devyls beleve) that he means not of the faith and trust that we have in the
truth of Gods promises and in his holy testame^te made unto us in Christ's
blood / which faith follows repentance and the consent of the heart / unto
the law of God / and makes a man safe / and sets him a^peace with God. But
speaks of that false opinion and ymaginacion where with some say / I beleve
that Christ was borne of a virgin / and that he deed and so forth. That
beleve they verily / and so strongely that they are ready to sley whosoever
would say the contrary. But they beleve not that Christ deed for their
sins / and that his death has peased the wrath of God and has obtained for
the^ all that God has promised in the scripture. For how ca^ they beleve that
Christ deed for their sins / and that he is there only and sufficient
savioure / seeing y^ they sefe other saviors of there own ymaginacion / and
seeing that they feale not their sins neither repe^te / except that some
repe^te (as I above said) for fear of pain / but for no love nor co^sente
unto the law of God nor lo^ginge that they have for those good promyses which
he has made them in Christ's blood Yff they repented and loved the law of
God and longed for that help which God has promised to gyve to all that call
on him for Christ's sake / then verily must Gods truth gy^e them power and
strength to do good works when so ever occasion were given / either must God
be a falls God. But let God be true and every man a liar as scripture says. For
the truth of god lasts ever / to whom only be all honor and glory forever.

Amen.

marvayle that it is so well as it is Moareover it becomes the book eve^ so to
come as a morner and in vile apparel to wait on his master which shows him
self now again not in honor and glory / as between Moses and Helias: but in
