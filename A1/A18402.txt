THE BLIND beggar of Alexandria, most pleasantly discoursing his variable
humors in disguised shapes full of conceit and pleasure. As it has been
sundry times publicly acted in London. by the right honorable the Earl of
Nottingham, Lord high Admiral his servants. By George Chapman: Gentleman.

Imprinted at London for William Jones, dwelling at the sign of the Gun ^eere
Holburne Conduict. 1598.

Enter Queen Aegiale, Janthe her maid two counselers. Aegiale. Leave ^e a
while my Lords and wait for me,
At the black fountain, by Os^is grove,
^le walk alone to holy Irus cave,
Talking a little while with him and then return.
Exeunt omnes. Manet Aegiale. Ianthe begone.
Now Irus Let thy minds eternal eye,
Extend the virtue of it past the Sun.
Ah my Cleanthes where art thou become,
But since I saved thy guiltless life from death,
And turned it onelyinto banishment,
Forgive me love, me pity comfort me.

Enter Irus the Beggar with Pego. Pego. Master.


Irus. Pego.


Pego. Wipe your eyes and you had them.


Jrus. Why Pego.


Pego. The Queen is here to see your blindness.


Irus. Her Majesty is well come, Heavens preserve,
And send her highness an immortal rain.

Aegi. Thanks reverent Irus for thy gentle prayer,
Dismiss thy man a while and I will lead thee,
For I have weighty secrets to impart.

Pego. Would I were blind that she might lead me.

Ex^.
Aegi. Irus thy skill to tell the driftes of fate,
Our fortunes and things hid from sensual eyes,
Has sent me to thee for aduertisment.
Where Duke Cle^nthes lives that was exilde,
This kingdom for attempting me with love,
And offering stayne to Ae^ipts royal bed.

Irus. I hope your majesty will pardon me,
I^ Conscience make me utter what I think,
Of that hye love affairs twixt him and you.

Aeg^. I will sweet Jrus being well assurd,
That whatsoever thy sharp wisdoms sees,
In my sad frailty thou w^llt have regard,
To my estate and name and keep (...) clo^*

Jrus. Of that your highness may be well assurde,
Then I am bound madam to tell you this,
That you your self did seek Cl^nthes love,
And to aspire it, made away his Duchess,
Which he well knowing and affecting her,
Dear as his life denied to satisfy,
That kindness offered twixt ^our self and him.
Therefore did ^ou in rage inform the Duke,
He sought ^our love, and so he (...) him.

Aeg^. To true it is grave Irus ^hou ha^t told,
But for my loves sake which not Gods can rule,
Strike me no more of that wound yet too green,
But only tell me where Cleanthes is,
That I may follow him in some disguise,
And make him recompense for all his wrong.

Irus Cleanthes is about this City off,
With whom your majesty shall meet ere long:
And speak with him, if you will vs^ such means,
As you may use for his discovery.

Aegi. What shall I use then what is in my power,
I will not use for his discovery,
I Will bind the wings of love unto mine arms,
And like a Eagle prying for her pray,
Will ouerlooke the earthes round face for him,
Were this sufficient.
Or I will Moorelike learn to swim and diue.
Into the bottom of the Sea for him.
Least being the son of Aegyp^ and now set,
Thetis in rage with love would ravish him.
Were this sufficient.

Irus. But Maddam this must be the likli^st mean
To seek him out, and have him at your will
Let his true picture through your land be sent.
Opposing great rewards to him that finds him,
And threaten death to them that succor him,
So I Will assure your grace shall meet with him ear long.

Aegi Happy and blessed be Irus for his skill
He sweetly plants in my contentious mind,
For which most reverent and religious man,
I give this Jewel to thee richly worth.
A kentall or an h^ndreth weight of gold,
Bestow it as thou list on some good work,
For well I know thou nothing do reserve,
Of all thy riches men bestow on thee,
But would thou leave this place and poor man's life,
The count of Aegipt should embrace thy feet,
And Toples honors be bestowed on thee,

Irus. I thank your highness for thus raising me,
But in this barrenness I am most renound.
For wisdom and the sight of heavenly things,
Shines not so clear as eathlye vanities.

Aegi. Most rich is Irus in his poverty
Oh that to find his skill my crown were lost.
None but poor Irus can of riches boast,
Now my Clea^thes I will straight advance
Thy lovely pictures on each monument
About the City and within the land.
Proposing twice five thousand Crowns to him,
That finds him to be tendered by my hands,
And a kind kiss at my imperial lipes,
To him that succors him, I Will threaten death,
But he that does not threaten him shall die,
For who is worthy, life will see him want.
To all his pictures when they be dispersed.
Will I continual pilgrimages make,
As to the saints and Idols I adore,
Where I will offer sighs, and vows, and tears.
And sac^ifice a hecatombe of beast,
On several alters built where they are plast,
By them shall Isis stature gently stand,
And I Will pretend my Jealous rites to her
But my Cleanthes shall the object be,
And I will kneel and pray to none but he.
Exit.
Irus. See Earth and Heaven where her Cleanthes is*
I am Cleanthes and blind Iru^ too,
And more then these, as you shall soon perceive,
Yet but a shepheardes son at Memphis borne,
And I will tell you how I got that name,
My Father was a fortune teller and from him I learnt his art,
And knowing to grow great, was to grow rich,
Such money as I got by palmestrie,
I put to use and by that means became
To take the shape of Leon. by which name,
I am well known a wealthy Usurer,
And more then this I am two noble men,
Count Hermes is another of my names,
And Duke Cleanthes whom the Queen so loves,
For till the time that I may claim the crown,
I mean to spend my time in sportes of love,
Which in the sequel you shall plainly see,
And Joy I hope in this my policy.

Enter Pego, Elimine, Samaphis, and Martia with there me^ Menippu^, Pollidor,
and Druso. Pego. Oh master here comes the three wenches now strike it dead
for a ^ortune.


Irus. These are the nymphs of Alexandria.
So called because there beauties are so rare.
With two of them at once am I in love
Deeply and Equally the third of them,
My silly brother here as much affectes,
Whom I have made the Burgomaister of this rich town,
With the great wealth, I have bestowed on him,
All three are maids kept p^ssing warilye,
Yet lately being at their ^athers house as I was Leon the rich vserer
I fell in love with them, and there my brother too,
This fitly chances that they have liberty,
To visit me alone: now will I tell their fortunes so,
As may make way to both their loves at once,
The one as I am Leon the rich vserer,
The other as I am the mad brain Count,
And do the best too, for my brothers love,

`Pe. Thanks good master brother, but what are they that
Talk with themso long are they wooers trow,
I do not like it, would they would come near.

Irus. O those are three servants that attend on them,
Let them alone, let them talk a while.

Eli. Tell us M^nippus, Druso, and P^lydor,
Why all our parents gave you three such charge,
To wait on us and over see us still,
What do they fear, think you that we would do.

Mem. There fear is least you should accompany,
Such as love wanton talk, and dalliance,

Eli. Why what is wanton talk.


Mem. To ^ell you that were to offend our selves,
And those that have forbidden you should hear it.

Sa. Why what is dalliance says my servant then,


Dru. You must not know because you must not dally.


Sa. How say you by that, well do you keep it from us, as much as you can,
we will desire it neuerlesse I can tell ye,


Mar. Lord what strait keepers of poor maids are you,
You are so chaste you are the worse again:

Eli. Pray you good servants will you do us the service,
To leave us alone a while.

Mem. We are commanded not to be from you,
And therefore to lean you alone,
Were to wrong the trust your parents put in us.

Ma. I cry you mercy sir, yet do not stand all on the
Trust our parents puts in you, but put us in a litell to I pray.

Sa. Trust us good servants by our selves a while.


Dru. Lets my mastrs and you say the word,
They Will but to Irus for to know their fortunes,
And he is a holy man all Egypt knows.

Mem. Stay not to long, then mistress and content,


Eli. That's my good servant we will straight return.


Po. And you mistress.


Mar. And I trusty servant.


Po. Faith then I Will venture my charge among the rest.

Ex^unt
Mar. A mighty venture you shall be cronicled in Abraham's asses,
Catalog of cockscombes for your resolution.

El^. Now the great fool take them all who could have,
Picked out three such liuelesse puppies,
Never to venture on their mistrisses.

S^. One may see by them it is not meet choice men should have offices,


Mar. A pretty morrall work it in the samplar of your heart,


Eli. But are we by our selves.


Mar. I think so unless you have alone in your belly.


Eli. Not I God knows I never camewhere they grew yet,
Since we are alone lets talk a little merrily,
Me thinks I long to know what wanton talk and dalliance is

Sa. I Will lay my life it is that my mother uses when she and others,
Do begin to talk and that she says to me maid,
Get ye hence fall to your needle: what a maid and Idle.

Ma. A maid and Idle why maids must be Idle but not an other thing.


Sa. then do not name it for I fear it is naught.
For ^esterday I hard Menippus as he was talking,
With my mothers maid and I stood harkning at the chamber door,
Said that, with that word a maid was got with child.

Eli How with the very word.


Sa. I mean with that the word seems to express.


Mar. Nay if you be so fine you will not name it now,
We are all alone, you are much too nice.

Eli. Why let her choose, let us two name it,


Mar. Do then Elimine.


Eli Nay do you Martia.


Mar. Why woman I dare.


Eli. Do then I warrant thee.


Mar. I Will warrant my self if I list, but come let it alone,
Let us to Irus for our fortunes.

Eli. God save grave Irus.


Irus. VVelcome beauteous Nymphs.


S^. How know you Irus we are beautiful and cannot see.


Irus. Hom^r was blind yet could he best di^cerne,
The shapes of every thing and so may I,

Eli. Indeed we hear your skill can beautify,
Beauty it self, and teach dames how to deck,
Their heads and bodies fittest to their forms,
To their complexions and their countenances.

Ir. So can I beateuous Nymphs, and make all eyes,
Sparkle with love fire from your excellence.

Eli. How think you we are tired to tempte men's looks,
Being thus Nimphlike is it not too strange,

Irus. It is the better so it does become.
But that I may disclose to you your fortunes
Tell me first Pego their true faces forms.

Pe. Mary ^r this that speaks to you has a face thin like unto water
grewell, but yet it would do your heart good if you could see it


Irus. I know and see it better then thy self,
The blaze whereof does turn me to a fire.
Burning mine Intrailes with a strong desire.

Eli. Why turnst thou from us Irus tell my fortune.


Irus. I wonder at the glory it presents,
To my souls health that sees upon your head,
Acorronet, and at your gracious feet,
Nobles and princes in their highest state,
Which state shall crown your fortune ear you die,
And ear the heart of Heaven, the glorious sun,
Shall quench his rosiat fires within the west.
You shall a husband have noble and rich.

Sa. Happy Elimine, oh that I might too.


Eli. Thanks for this new^s good Irus but disclose,
The means to this, if it be possible.

Irus. When you come home ascend your Fathers tower
If you see a man come walking by,
And looking up to you, descend,
And Issue, for you shall have leave,
And if he woe, you choose him from the world,
Though he seem humorous and want an eye,
VVearing a velvet patch upon the same,
Choose him your husband, and be bl^st in him,

Eli. I Will do as thou adu^sest gentle Irus,
And proving this I Will love thee (...) I live.

Sa. My fortune now sweet Irus.


Irus. What face has this Nymph Peg^.


P^go. Mary sir a face m^de in form like the ace of hearts.


Irus. And well compard for she commaundes al^ hearts,
Equal in beauty with that other Nymph,
And equally she burns my heart with love,

Sa. Say, s^y sweet Irus what my fortune is,
Thou turnst from me, as when thou did admire.
The happ^e fortune of Elimine.

Irus. So might I well, admiring yours no less.
Then when the light cround monarch of the hea-
Shall quench his fire within the Oceans breast (ue^s
Rise you and to your fathers garden hie,
There in an arbor do a banquet s^,
And if there come a man that of him self,
Sits down and bi^s you welcome to your feast,
Accept him for he is the richest man,
That Alexandria or Egypt has,
And soon possessing him with all his wealth,
In little time you shall be (...) of him,
Making your second choice among mighty kings.

Sa. Blessed be thy ^ppes sweet Irus, and that light,
That guides thy bosom with such deep fore sight,
Sleep shall not make a closet for these eyes,
All this succeeding night for have to rise.

Ma. My fortune now sweet Irus, but I faith,
I have some wrong to be the last of all,
For I am old as they, and big enough,
To bear as great a fortune as the best of them,

I^us. What face has this Nymph Pego.


Pego. Oh master what face has she not, if I should beg a face I would have
her face.

Irus. But is it ro^nd, and has it near a blemmish,
A mouth to wide a look too impudent.

Pego. Oh master it is without all these, and without al cry.


Irus. Round faces and thin skinde are hapieest still.
And unto you fair Nymph.
Shall fortune be exceeding gracious too,
When the next morning therefore you shall rise,
Put in your bosom rosemary time and rue.
And presently stand at your fathers door,
He that shall come offering kindness there,
And crave for favor those same wholesome herbs,
bestow them on him, and if meeting him,
He keep the nuptial Rosemary and time,
And tread the bitter rue beneath his feet,
Choose him your husband and be blessed in him.

Ma. I will sweet Irus nothing greeues me now,
But that Elimine this night shall have,
Her happy husband, and I s^ay till morning.

Eli. Naught gr^ues me Irus but that we are maids.
Kept short of all things and have naught to give thee,
But take our loves and in the wished proof,
Of these high f^rtunes thou foretellest us.
Nothing we have shall be to dear for thee.

Sa. we that are sisters Irus by our vow,
Will be of one self blood and thankful mind,
To adore so clear a sight in one so blind.
exeunt.
Irus. farewell most beauteous Nymphs your loves to me.
Shall ^ore then gold or any treasure be,
Now to my wardroppe for my velvet gown, now does the sport begin,
Come gird this pistole closely to my side,
By which I make men fear my humor still,
And have slain two or three as twere my
When I have done it most advisedly (mood
To rid them as they were my heavy foes,
Now am I known to be the mad brain Count,
Whose humors twice, five summers I have held,
And said at first I came from stately Rome,
Calling my self Count Hermes and assuming
The humor of a wild and frantic man,
Careless of what I say or what I do,
And so such faults as I of purpose do,
Is buried in my humor and this gown I wear,
In rain or snow or in the hottest summer,
And never go nor ride without a gown,
which humor does not fit my frencie well,
But hides my persons form from being known,
When I Cleanthes am to be discried,

Enter Pego like a Burgomaister. Pego. How now master brother.


Ir. Oh sir you are very well suited. Now M. Burgomaister.
I pray you remember to seize on all Aleantisthenes his goods
His lands and cattels to my propper use,
As I am Leon the rich usurer.
The sun is down and all is forfeited.

Pego. It sh^lbe done my noble Count.


Ir. And withal sir I pray you forget not your love,
To morrow morning at her fathers door.

Pego. Ah my good Count I cannot that forget,
For still to keep my memory in order,
As I am Burgomaister, so love is my recorder.
Exeunt, Enter Elimine above on the walls. Now see a morning in an evening
rise.
The morning of my love and of my joy,
I will not say of beauty, that were pride,
With in this tower I would I had a torch,
To light like hero my leander heat^er,
Who shall be my lea^der let me see,
Rehearse my fortune.
When you see one clad in a velvet gown
And a black patch upon his eye,
A patch, patch that I am, why that may be a patch of cloth,
Of Buckrome, or a fustian cloth, say with a velvet patch,
Upon his eye and so my thoughts may patch up love the better
See where he comes, the Count, what girl a countess,
Enter Count. See, see, he looks as Irus said he should go not away my love,
I Will meet thee straight.

Count. Oh I thank you I am much beholding to you,
I saw her in the tower and now she is come down,
Luck to this patch and to this velvet gown.

Enter Elimine and Bragadino A Spaniard following her. Count. How now shall I
be troubled with this rude spaniard now,

so saucie sir.


Brag. Oh I know him well it is the rude Count the uncivil Count, the unstayed
Count, the bloody Count, the Count of all Countes, better I were to hazard the
dissolution of my brave soul against an host of grantes then with this loose
Count, otherwise I could tickle the Count, I faith my noble Count, I do
descend to the craving of pardon, love blinded me I knew thee not.


Count. Oh sir you are but bonaventure not right spanish I perceive but do you

Brag. Surely the sudden glaunce of this lady Nymph has suppled my spanish
disposition with love that never before drempt of a woman's concauitie.


Count. ^ woman's conc^uitie, sblood what is that,


Brag. Her hollow dispositon which you see sweet nature will supplye or
otherwise stop up in her with solid or firm faith.


Co. Give me thy hand wear lovers both, shall we have her both


Bra. No good sweet Count pardon me.


Count Why then thus it shall be we will strike up a drum, set up a tent, call

face toward her, the other shall follow with his back toward her biting of
his thumbes, how say thou by this.


Brag. It is ridiculous, but I am pleased for upon my life I do kn^w this the
shame will light on the neck of the Count.


Count. Well to it lets hear thee.


Brag. Sweet Nymph a spaniard is compard to the to the great elixar or golden

Bra. Nay by thy sweet favor do not interrupt me.


Count. Well sir go forward.


B^ag. I say a spaniard is like the Philosophers stone.


Count. And I say an other man's stone may be as good as a Philosophers at all
times.


Brag. By thy sweet favor.


Count. Well sir go on.


Brag. Sweet nymph I love few words you know my intent my humor is in

(...). Oh is that all why see it is up again, now thou shall lee I Will come to

Eli. It is enough my Lord and I am youres.
Since I well know my fortune is to have you
Now must I leave the ^leasant maiden chase,
In hunting savage beasts with Is^s nymphs,
And take me to a life which I God knows,
Do know no more then how to scale the heavens.

Count. Well I Will teach you fear not you, what signior ^ot bite your thumbes,


Bra. Pardon me sir, pardon me.


Count. By Gods blood I will not pardon you therefore bite your thumbes.


Bra. By thy sweet let me speak one word with thee, I do not like this humor
in thee in pistoling men in this sort, it is a most dangerous and stigmaticall
humor, for by thy favor it is the most sinest thing of the world for a man to
have a most gentlemanlike car^iage of himself, for otherwise I do hold thee
for the most tall resolute and accomplished gentleman on the face of the earth,
hark ye we will meet at Corrucus and we will have a pipe of Tobacco adieu adieu.


Co. Do you hear sir, put your thumbes in your mouth with out any more ado,

Exeunt.
(...) Ae^iale, Herald, Euribates, Clearchus with a picture. Aegi. Advance that
picture on this fatal spring,
And Herald speak uttering the kings edict.

He. Ptolomie the most sacred king of Egypt first of that n^me, desiring peace
and amity with his neighbor princes has caused this picture of Cleanthes to
be set up in all places, proposing great rewards to him that finds him, and
threatening death to him that sucours him.


Aegi. Which Gods forbid, and put it in his mind.
Not so to stomach his unjust exile.
That he convert the fury of his arm,
Against fosaken Egypt taking part,
With those four neighbor kings that threaten him,
And have beseiged his most Imperial town.

Clear. Now may it please your highness to leave your discontented passions,
and take this mornings pride to hunt the Bore.


(...). We have attended on our grace thus far,
Out of the City being glad to hear,
Your highness had abandoned discontent.
And now will bend your self to meriment,

Aegi. So will I lovely Ianthe come then.
Let us go call forth sacred Isis Nymphs,
To help us keep the game in cealesse view,
That to the busy brightness of his eyes.
We may so interuent his shifts to escape.
That giddie with his turning he may fall, (...)
Slain with our beauties more then sworde^ on darts.
Exit with a sownd of Horns.
Enter Leon with his sword. Leon.. Now am I Leon The rich usurer and here
according
To the kings command and mine own promise.
I have brought my sword and fix it by the statue,
She set up, by this am I known to be Cleanthes,
Whose sudden sight I now will take upon me,
And cause the nobles to pursue my shadow,
As for my subs^nce they shall never find,
Till I my self, do bring my self to light.
Cleanthes, Cleanthes, stop Cleanthes, see Cleanthes,
Pursue Cleanthes, follow Cleanthes.

Enter three Lords with swords drawn. ^ Lo. where is Cleanthes, Leon saw
thou him.


Le. I why should I else have thus cried out on him,
I saw him even now here did he fix his sword
And not for dastard fear or cowardice,
For know all Egypt ^inges of his renown.
But fearing for his noble service done,
To be rewarded with ingratitude, he fled
From hence fearing to be pursued,

2. Lord. Come on my Lords then let^ follow him
And pursue him to the death.
Exeunt.
Leon. Oh do not hurt him gentle Citizens,
See how they fly from him whom they pursue.
I am Cleanthes, and whilst I am hear,
In vain they follow for to find him out,
But here comes my love Bright Psamathis,
Whom I love Equally with fair Elimine,
See here she comes as I appointed her.

Enter Samathis and her maids with a banquet. Iaquine. But I faith mistress is
this for a woer.


Sa. Not for a woer only my Jaquine,
But a quick speeder girl for this is he,
That all my ^tune runs upon I tell thee,

Ia. O dainty mistress send for some more banquet.


Sa. No my fine wench this and my self is well.
And let him not sit down like the ox and the ass,
But give God thanks for we are worthy of it though we faite.

Ia. Mistress it is true.
And that he may be good,
I conjure him by these three things a cross,
Now let him come he shall be good I warrant ye,

Leon. Nay do not fly me gentle Samathis,


Sa. Pardon me sir for if I see a man,
I shall so blush still that I warrant you,
I could make white wine claret with my looks,

Le. But do not blush and fly an old man's sight.


Sa. From whom if no^ from old men should I fly


Le. From young men rather that can swift pursue,
And then it is some credit to out go them,
Yet though my years would have me old I am not,
But have the gentle Ierke of youth in me,
As fresh as he that has a maidens chinne.
Thus can I bend the stiffnes of my limbs,
Thus can I turn and leap and hoyse my gate,
Thus can I lift my love as light as air,
Now say my Samathis am I old or yo^g.

Sa. I would have my love neither old nor young
But in the middle Just between them both.

Le. Fit am I then for matchless Samathis.
And will be bold to sit. For batchlers
Must not be shamefast when they meet with maids,
Sweet love now let me entreat you sit,
And welcome you to your own banquet here,

Sa. Even thus did ^rsu say that he should say,
Then by your leave sir I will sit with you,

Le. VVelcome as gold into my tresurie,
And now will I drink unto my love.
VViththe same mind that drinking first began to one another.

Sa. And what was that I pray sir.


Le. I Will tell my love the first kind cause of it.
And why it is vsd as kindness still amongst us,
If it be vsda right it is to this end,
When I do say I drink this love to you,
I mean I drink this to your proper good,
As if I said what health this wine does work in me,
Shall Be employed for you at your command and to your proper use
And this was first thentent of drinking to you.

Sa. It Is very pretty is it not Jaquine.


Iaquine. Oh excellent Mistress he is a dainty man.


Leon. Now to your use sweet love I drink this wine,
And with a merry heart that makes long life,
Over the cup I Will sing for my loves sake.
Song.
Health, fortune, mirth, and wine,
To thee my love divine.
I drink to my dareling,
Give me thy hand sweeting.
UUith cup full ever plied,
And ^artes fullneuer dried.
Mine own, mine own dearest sweeting.
Oh oh mine own dearest sweeting.
What frollicke love mirth makes the banquet sweet.


Sa. I love it sir as well as you love me.


Leon. That is as well as I do love my self,
I will not Joy my treasure but in thee,
And in thy looks I Will count it every hour,
And thy white arms shall be as bands to me,
Wherein are mighty Lordshippes forfeited,
And all the dames of Alexandria,
For their attire shall take there light from thee,

Sa. Well sir I drink to you and pray you think
You are as welcome to me as this wine,

Le. Thanks gentle Samathis, but delitious love,
Has been the fig I eat before this wine,
Which kills the taste of these delitious cates,
Will you bestow that banquet love on me,

Sa. Nay gentle Leon talk no more of love
If you love God or a good countenance,
For I shall quite be out of countenance then,

Le. Love deckes the countenance, speriteth the eye,
And tunes the soul in sweetest harmony,
Love then sweet Samathis.

Sama. What shall I do Iaquine.


Iaquine. Faith Mistress take him.


Sa. Oh but he has a great nose.


Ia. It Is no matter for his nose, for he is rich.


Sa. Leon I love and since it is forth farewell.


Le. Then triumph Leon ^icher in thy love.
Then all the heaps of treasure I possess,
Never was happy Leon rich before,
Nor ever was I covetous till now,
That I see gold so fined in thy hair.

Sa. Impart it to my Parents gentle Leon,
And till we meet again at home farewell.
Exeunt.
Le. Soon will I talk with them and follow thee,
So now is my desire accomplished.
Now was there ever man so fortunate.
To have his love so sorted to his wish,
The joys of many I (...) one enjoy.
Now do I mean to woe them crossely
The one as I am Leon the rich usurer. (both,
The other as I am the mad brain Count.
Which if it take effect, and rightly prove,
Twill be a sport for any emperors love.
Exit.
Enter Ptolomie, Aegiale, Doricles, Aspatis, Ianthe, Euphrosine, Clearchus,
Euribates, with sound, Pto. Prince of Arcadia lovely Doricles,
Be not discouraged that my daughter here,
Like a well fortified and lofty tower,
I^ so repulsiue and unapt to yield,
The royal siege of your he^oycke parts,
In her acheeuement will be more renound,
And with the greater merit is imployde.
The bewtious queen my wife her mother here
Was so well mand and yet had never man,
So main a rock of chaste and cold disdain.

Aegi. My Lord what mean ye, go Aspasia,
Send for some Ladeis to go play with you,
At chesse, at Billiardes, and at other game,
Ianthe attend her.
You take a course my Lord to make her coy,
To urge so much the love of D^ricles,
And frame a virtue of her wanton hate,
We must persuade her that he loves her not,
But that his services and vows of love,
Are but the gentle complimentes of court,
So would she think that if she would have loud,
She might have won him.
And with that conceit of hardness to be won,
His merits grace will shine more clearly,
In her turning eyes,
Things hard to win with ease makes love ^ited,
And favors won with ease are hardly quited,
Then make as If you loud her not my Lord.

Do. Love that has built his temple on my brows
Out of his Battlementes into my heart,
And seeing me to burn in my desire,
Will be I hope appeased at the last.

Aegi. Be ruld by me yet, and I warrant you,
She quickly shall believe you love her not,

Do. What shall I do Madam.


Aegi. Look not on her so much.


Do. I cannot choose my neck stands never right,
Till it be turned asside and I behold her.

Aegi. Now trust me such a wrie neck^ love was never seen,
But come with me my Lord and I Will instruct you better

Pto. So maddam I leave you now from our love sportes,
To Antistenes and his great ^ute with Le^n,
Enter Antistenes Leon and Burgomaister. See the Burgomaister Antistenes and
Leon.
Comes together stay master Burgomaister.
What reason made you use your office on the
Lord Antistenes seazing on al his moueables,
And goods at the suit of Leon.

Pe. I will tell your grace the reason of it or any
Thing else for I know you are a wise prince,
And apt to learn.

Pto. I thank you for you^ good opinion sir,
But the reason of your office done upon this noble man
And his lands.

Pe. The reason why I have put in office or execution,
My authority upon this nobleman consists,
in three principal points or members,
Which indeed are three goodly matters.

Ptolo. I pray you lets hear them.


Pe. The first is the credit of this honest man because he is rich.


Pto. Why is he honest because he is rich.


Pe. Oh I learn that in any case, the next is the forfaite of his assurance
and the last I will not trouble your grace with all.


An. But this it is whereof I most complain unto your grace,
That hau^ng occasion in your graces service,
To borow money of this Leon here,
For which I morgagd al my lands and goods
He only did agree that paying him four
thousand pound at the day I should receive
safely, in which now not only falsely he denies* (my statute
But that he has received one penny due,
Which this my friend can wittnes I repay de,
Upon the stone of Irus the blindeman,
Four thousand pound in Jewels and in gold,
And therefore crave I justice in this case,

L^. Voutchsafe dre^ sovereign an impartial ^are.
To that I have to say for my (...),
He pleades the pay^nt of four thousand pound,
Upon the stone before blind Irus cave,
To which I answer and do swear by heaven,
He spoke with me at the foresaid place,
And promised payment offoure thousand pound,
If I would let him have his statu^es in,
And take other assurance for another thousand,
Some three months to come or thereaboutes.
Which I refusing he repayde me none,
But parted in a rage and card not for me.

Genesis Oh monstrous who ever hard the like.
My Lord I will be sworn he paid him,
On poor Irus stone four thousand pound,
Which I did help to tender and have thou
A hellish conscience and such a brazen forhead,
To deny it against my witness,
And his noble word.

Le. Sir against your witness and his noble word,
I plead mine own and one as good as his,
That then was present at our whole conference.

An. My Lord there was not any but our selves,
But who was it that thou affirmst was there,

Le. Count Hermes good my Lord a man
Well known though he be humorous to be ho^orable,

Pto. And will he say it.


Le. He will my gracious Lord I am well assurd,
And him will I send hither presently,
Entreating your gr^ious favor if the impediment,
Of a late sickness cause me not return,
For I am passing ill.

Pto. Well send him hither and it shall suffi^.


Le. I will my gracious Lord and stand
To any censure passing willingly,
Your highness shall set down or command,
Worshipful master Burg^maister your officer,
To see performd betwixt us.
Exit.
Pe. We Thank you heartily, alas poor soul,
How sick he is.
Truly I cannot choose but pity him,
In that he loves your gracious officers,

Enter Coont. Pto. Oh I thank you sir.


Count. King by your leave, and yet I need not ask leave,
Because I am sent for if not I Will begone again.
without leave, say am I sent for yea or no,

Pto. You are to witness twixt Antistenes and welthy Leon.


Count. I know the matter and I come from that old miser
Leon, who is suddenly fallen sick of a knaves evil,
Which of you are troubled with that disease masters.

Pto. Well say what you know of the matter, betwixt them.


Count. Then thus I say my Lord, Antistenes came,
To the stone of the blind fool Irus,
That day when four thousand pounds were to be paid,
Where he made proffer of so much money if Leon would return the morgage of
his lands, and take assurance for another thousand to be paid I trow some
three months to come or there about, which Leon like an old churl as he was
most discourteously refused: my Lord Antistenes as he might very well departed
in a rage but if it had been to me I would have pistoled him I faith.


An. But you are wonderously deceived my Lord.
And was not by when he and we did talk.

Count. Swounes th^n I say you are deceived my Lord,
For I was by now by my honor and by all the gods.

Eu. Then you stood close my Lord unseen to any,


Count. Why I stood close to you and seen of all, and if You think I am too
mad a fellow to witness such a weighty piece of work the holy beggar shall
perform as much, For he was by at our whole conference.


Pto. But say Count Hermes was the beggar by.


Count. I say he was and he shall say he was.


Euri. But he is now they say locked in his ca^e,
Fasting and praying talking with the Gods,
And has an Iron door twixt him and you,
How will you then come at him,

Count. I Will fetch him from his cave in spite of all his Gods and Iron do^es,
or beat him bli^de when as I do catch him next, farewell my Lords you have
done with me, I Will send the beggar presently for I am now ryding to Corrucus.

Exit.
Pto. I know not what to think in these affairs
I cannot well condemn you my Lord,
And your s^fficient witness being a gentleman,
Nor yet the other two, both men of credit,
Though in his kind this Count be humorous,
But stay we shall here straight what Irus will depose,

Enter Irus. Irus Oh who disturbes me in my holy prayers,
Oh that the king were by that he might here,
What thundering there is at my farther door,
Oh how the good of Aegipt is disturbd in my devotion.

Pto. I am here Irus and it was Count He^mes.
That was so rude to Interrupt thy prayers,
But I suppose the end of thy repair,
Being so weighty could not have displeasd,
For on thy witness does d^pend the living
Of Lord Antistenes, who does affirm,
That three days past he tendered at thy stone,
Four thousand pounds to Leon, and desired
His morgage quited which he promising
On such assurance, more as he proposed,
Received at that time his four thousand pounds.

Irus. I then was in the hearing of them both.
Bnt hard noe penny tendered, only proposed
By Lord Antistenes, if he would bring him in,
His morgage and take assurance for another thousand
Some three months to come or there aboutes,
Which Leon most discourteously refused,
My Lord was angrye and I hard no more,
And thus must I crave pardon of your grace.
Exit
Pto. Farewell grave I^s.


An. Gods are become oppressors of the right.


Euge. Never had right so violent a wrong.
For let the thunder strike me into hell.
If what I have reported be not true,

Pto. This holy man no doubt speaks what he hard
And I am sorry for Antistenes.
But I Will relieve your low estate my Lord,
And for your service done me gwerdon you,
Master Burgoma^ster let the Lord have liberty,
And I will answer Leon what is due.
Exeuut.
Enter Eli^nime, Martia, Samathis. Eli. Soft Mistress Burgomaister, pray you
stay, your heart is
greater then your parson far or your state either, do we not
know ye trow, what woman you are but a Burgomaisters wife,
And he no wiser then his neighbors ney^her,
Give me the place acording to my calling.

Mar. What skill for places, do we not all call sisters,


Eli. Noe by my faith I am a countess now,
I should have one to go before me bare,
And say stand by there to the best of them,
And one to come behind and bear my train,
Because my hands must not be put unto it.
My husbaud is a Lord and past a Lord,

Sa. And past a Lord what is that past I pray,


Eli. Why he is a what you calt.


Mar. A what you call it can you not name it.


Eli. I think I must not name it.


Sa. And why so I pray.


Eli. because it comes so near a thing that I know,


Mar. Oh he is a Count that is an Earl.


Sa. And yet he is not known to have much land.


Eli. Why therefore he is an unknown man.


Mar. I but my husband is the kings officer.


Sa. I but my husband is able to (...) (...) yours,


Eli. You say husband, I may say (...) Lord.


Mar. And me thinks husband is worth ten o^ Lord.


Eli. Indeed I love my Lord to call me (...),
Better then Maddam yet do I not mean^,
To lose my Ladies, titles at your hands,
I may for courtesy and to be termd,
A gentle Lady call you sisters still,
But you must say and please your Ladishippe,
It Is thus and so, and as your honor (...),
Yet shall my husband call me wife lik^ youres,
For why made god the husband and the wife,
But that those terms should please us more then others
New fashion terms I like not for a man,
To call his wife cony, forsooth, and Lamb,
And Porke, and Mutton, he as well may say,

Mar. Well Madam then and please your Ladishippe,
What gowns and head tyres will your honor wear.

Eli. Twenty are making for me head tyres and gowns,
Head tyres enchast in order like the stars,
Which perfect great and fine cut precious stones,
One has bright Ariadnes Crown in it,
Even in the figure it presents in heaven,
Another has the fingers of Diana,
And Berenices ever burning hair,
An other has the bright Andr^mica,
With both her silver wristes bound to a rock,
And Perseus that did lose her and save her life,
All set in number and in perfect form,
Even like the Asterismes fixed in heaven,
And even as you may see in Moon shine nights,
The Moon and Stars reflecting on their streams
So from my head shall you see stars take beams,

Mar. Oh brave God willing I will have the like.


Sa. And so will I by Gods grace if I live.


Eli. Come up to supper it will become the house wonderful well


Mar, Well if my husband will not, let him not look for one good look of me.


Sa. Nor mine I swear.


Mar. I Will ask my husband when I am with child,
And then I know I shall be sped I faith.

(...). But every pleasure has a pain they say
My husband lies each other night abroad,

Sa. and so does mine which I like but little,


Mar. Well time I hope and change of company,
Will teach us somewhat to bear out the absence,
Exit.
Eli. I know not what to say,
My husband makes as if each other night he had occasion,
To ride from home at home serves not his turn,
To mygood turn it, cupid I beseech you,

Enter Leon and Druso following him. Le. Now will I try to make my self the
Count.
An arrant Cuckold and a witto^ too.

Dru. Now may I chance to prove a cunning man,
And tell my mistress where mymaister hauntes,

Le. Bright Nymph I come in name of all the world,
That now sustaines dead winter in the spring,
To have a graces from thy summer darted,
Thy love sweet^soule is all that I desire,
To make a general summer in this heart,
Where winters duble wrath has t^nisde.

Eli. How dare you Leon thus solicit me,
Where if the Count my husband should come now,
And see you courting you were sure to die.

Le. Oh but he is safe, for at my house,
Booted and spurd and in his velvet gown,
He took his horse and rode unto Corrucus,
And therefore beauteous Lady mak^ not strange,
To take a and and add un to thy Joys,
O^ happ^ wedlock: the end of every act,
Is to inc^se con^nt and renown,
Both which my love: shall amplye joy in you,

Eli. How can ^owne ensue an ^ct of shame,


Le. No ac^ has any shame within itself,
But in the knowledge and ascription.
Of the base world from whom shall this be kept,
As in a laborinth or a brazen tower.

Fl. But virtues sole regard must hold me back.


Le. The virtue of each thing is in the praise,
And I will rea^ thy praises to the skies,
Out of my tresurie choose the choice of gold,
Till thou find some matching thy hair in brightness,
But that will never, be so choose thou ever.
Out of my Iewelrye choose thy choice of Diamondes*
Till thou find some as bright some as thine eyes,
But that will never be, so choose thou ever,
Choose Rubies out until thou match thy lips,
Pearl till thy teeth, and Iuorie till thy skin,
Be matched in witness but that will never be.
Nor never shall my tresurie have end,
Till on there beauties Ladies loath to spend,
But that will never be so choose thou ever.

Eli. Now what a gods name would this vain man have,
Do you not shame to tempt a woman thus,
I know not what to say nor what to do,
He would have me do that I fear I should not,
Some thing it is he seeks that he thinks good,
And me thinks he should be more wise then I,
I am a foolish girl though I be married
And know not what to do, the Gods do know.

Leon. Are you content sweet love to grant me love,


Eli. and what then sir.


Le. To grant me lodging in your house this night,


Eli. I think the man be weary of his life,
Know you the Count my husband.

L^. Marvelous well and am^assurd of him,


Eli. Faith that you ^re as sure as I my self,
So you did talk of gold and Diamonds,

Leon. I and gold and Diamondes shall my sweet love have,


Eli. Well I Will not bid you sir but if you come,
At your own peril for I Will wash my hands.
Offer to go ou^.
L^on. A plague of all sanguine simpliciti


Eli. But do you hear sir pray you do not think that I granted you.


Le. No I warrant you, I Will have no such thought. (in any case
Oh this is old excellent.
Now who can desire better sport.
This night my other wife must lie alone,
And next night this wife must do the like.
Now will I woe the other as the Count*
Which if she grant and they do break their troth,
I Will make my self a cuckolde twixt them both.
Exit.
Druso. I Will follow him until he take the earth, and then i will leave him.

Exit.
Enter Samathis alone. Sa. Now if my husband be not all alone,
He is from home and has left me alone,
So I must learn to lie, as children go,
All alone, all alone, which lesson now.
I am able to bear a child is worsse to me then when I was a child
The moral this strength without a health a disadvantage is.
Enter Druso. Mistress what will you say if I can tell you where my master is,


Sa. Where Druso I pray thee.


Dru. Even close with the young countess I faith.


Sa. Out on her strumpet does she brag so much,
Of her great Count, and glad to take my husband
Hence comes her head tyres and her fay^ gowns,
Her train borne up and a man bare before her,
Was this my fortune that should be so good,
I faith you beggar you, you old false knave,
You holy v^e you propheticke ass,
Know you noe better what shall come to pass,
I Will be revenged I faith, I faith I Will be revenged.
Exit.
Enter Aegiale wiuh the guard Aegi. Oh Irus shall thy long approved skill,
Fail in my fortunes only, when shall I meet,
With my Cleanthes what a world of time,
Is it for me to lie as in a sound,
Without my life Cleanthes, can it be,
That I shall ever entertayne again,
Having the habit of cold death in me,
My life Cleanthes.
Count knock within Let me come in you knaves, I say let me come in,


1. Guard. Sir, we are set to guard this place as our lives and None without a
warrant from the King or the Queen must enter here.


Co^ Swoundes tell not me of your warrantes, let me come in I say,


1. Ga. My Lord we are commanded to keep out all comers, because of the
branch wherein the kings life remaynes,


Co. Let me come in you knaves, how dare you keep meout, it was my gown to a
mantle of rugge, I had not put you all to the pistol.


Aegi. Shall we be troubled now with this rude Count


Cou. How now Queen what art thou doing, passioning over the picture of
Cleant^ I am sure for I know thou love him,


Aegi. What Is that you traitor.


Count. No traitor neither bnt a true friend to you, for had Ibene otherwise I
should have dis^losed the secret talk thou had with Cleanthes in the arbor,
the night before he was banished, whilst I stood close and hard all.


Ae. The man is mad chains and a whippe for him.


Cou. Be patient my wench and I Will tell the the very words, oh my Cleanthes,
love me, pity me, hate me not for love, and it is not lust has made me thus
importunate, for then there are men enough besides Cl^es, go to tell me were not
these your words, and I like no traitor to you but a tru^ie friend now by this
pistol which is Gods angel I never uttered them till now


Aegi. I spoke them not but had you been so bad,
As some men are you might have said as much,
By fi^s only therefore I must needs,
Think much the better of you to conceal it,

Count. Oh your a cunning wench and am not I ^ mad slave to have such virtue as
s^resic in me and none never looked ^or any such thing at my hands, and here is a
branch forsooth of your little son turned to a Mandracke tree, by Hella the
sorceresse.


Aeg^le. It Is true and kills me to remember it.


Cou. Tut tut remember it and be wise thou would have Cleanthes, come again
would thou not,


Ac. The king is so aduisd to give him death.


Connt. The King, come come it is you rule the King now would any wise woman in
the world be so hungerstarued for a m^n and not use the means to have him,
think thou Cleanthes will come again to have his head chopped of so soon as
he comes, but had you plucked up this branch wherein the King thy husbands life
consistes and burnt it in the fire, his old beard would have stunckefort in
the grave ere this, and then thou should have seen whether Cleanthes would
have come unto thee or no^.


A^gi. Oh excreable counsel.


Count. Go to it is good counsel, take the grace of God before your eyes, and
follow it to it wench corragio, I know I have gotten thee with child of a
desire, and thou longst but for a knife to let it out, hold there it is serve God
and be thankful, now you knaves will you let me come out trow.


1. Guard. Please your Lordshippe to bestow something on us for we are poor
knaves.


Count. Hark you be even knaves still, and if you be poor long your foolish
knaves, and so I Will leave you.


2. Guard. Nay swounes my Lord no knaves neither.


Cou. Then he was a knane that told me so, what do thou tell me that.

Exit.
Ae. This serpents counsel stinges me to the heart.
Mountes to my brain and binds my prince of sense.
My voluntary motion and my life,
Sitting it self triumphing in there thrones,
And that does force my hand to take this knife,
That bows my knees and sets me by thy branch,
Oh my diones oh my only son,
Can thou now feel the rigor of a knife,
Noe thou art senseless and I Will cut thee up,
I Will shroude thee in my bosom safe from storms,
And trust no more my trustlesse guard with thee,
Come then return unto thy mothers arms, and when I pull thee forth to scrue
the fire, turn thy self wholly into a burning tongue, in voking furies and
infernal death, to cool thy torments with thy fathers breath.


Enter Elimine and Samathis. Sa. Now madam countess do you make account.
To take up husbands by your countishippe.
Have you the broad seal for i^, are you so hye, and stoop,
To one so low as is my husband,
Hence come your headtyres and your costly gowns,
Your train borne up and a man bare before you,
Now sye on pride when woman go thous naked.
I ever thoug^ that pride would have a fall
But little thought it would have such a fall.

Eli. What fall I pray you.


Sa. There you lay last, forsooth there you lay last.


Eli. Be not so angry woman you are deceived


Sa. I know I am deceived for thou deceiuedst me,
Thou might as well have pict my pursse I tell thee,
Oh would my mother say, when you have a husband.
Keep to him only but now one may see,
How horible a thing it is to change,
Because it angers one so ho^bly,
You must have Vshers to make way be^e you,

Eli. The dame is mad, I Will stay no longer with her.

Exit Elimine.
Sa. Well mad^ short heels I Will be even withyou,

riding gown here.


Sa. Is this your riding gown my Lord.


Count. It Is no matter what it is, talk not to me, what the d^ll did I mean to
call thee back again,


Sa. Why, my Lord I mean not to trouble you,


Count. Go to stay I say, it is against my will that I use you so kindly I can
tell you.


Sa. Why you may ch^se my Lord.


Count. I but I cannot choose, there you lie now, it is love forso^th that
Intailes me to you, for i^ it had not been for love, I had not been here
now, for the Gods do know I hold thee dearer then the Poungranet of mine eye,
and that's better by three pence then the aple of mine eye.


Sa. My Lord I am sorry for your heaviness.


Count. Nay it is no matter I am not the first ass that has borne Cupides
tresurie.


Sa. My Lord it is enough to make an ass wise to bear tres^.


Count. Why then be you that wi^ ass, and bear me for
I have some treasure ^ut me will you love me.

Sa. Love you my Lord it is strange you will ask it.


Count. I am not the first has desired you*


Sa. Nor you shall not be the last I wi^ refuse.


Count. Nor are you the fairest I have seen,


Sa. Nor the foulest you hau^ loud.


Count. Nor the fittest to be beloved.


Sa. Nor the unfittest to hate.


Count. Do and you dare but sir and thou will not love,
I pray thee be proud

Sa. Why so my Lord.


C^t. Because I would have thee fall, for pride must have a fall.


Sa. Do you delight in my fall so much.


Count. As much as in mine own rising I faith, but do not you think it
strange that I do love you, for before I did love you, Cupid pin^kt me a
spanish lether Ierkin with shooting at me, and made it so ^ull of holes that I
was feign to leave it of, and this loss have I had for your sake.


Sa. My Lord I Will bestow an old Ierkin on you,


Count. Nay that shall not serve your turn, for I have had a greater loss
then that, I lost my left eye ^or your sake.


Sa. I do not think so.


Count. I but I Will tell you how as I was hunting in the park, I saw Cupid
shooting a cockhye into your face, and gazing after his arrow it fell into mine
eye.


Sa. A pretty fiction.


Count. I but I find this no fiction, and you shall make me amends with love
or by this patch of mine eye, and the patch thou wotest where I will swear to
all the City I have layne with thee*


Sa. I hope your Lordshippe will not do me that wrong.


Count. Then do you me right and let me lie with you, I have made the botle
nosd knave your husband so drunk that he is not able to stand go get you home
I Will follow you.


Sa. Why my Lord what will you do there.


Count. Go to make no more questions but say I shall be welcome or by mine
honor I Will do as I say, otherwise be as secret as death.


Sa. Twenty to one he will, well my Lord if you come you come.


Count. Oh I thank you heartily, oh exellent or never trust me.


Enter Menippus and Elimine. Me. Madam your honor is come somewhat to soon.


Eli. Why so Menippus.


Me. Had you stayed never so little longer you should have met my Lord coming
out of Leons ^^use and out of his moueables,


Eli. How out of his moueables.


Me. Even in plain troth, I see him woe her, win her, and went in with her.


Eli. Now of mine honor I will be revenged fetch me the Burgomaister Menippus
I Will have them both whipped about the town.


Me. Nay madam you must not dshonor him so,


Eli. What shall mine honor do then.


Me. Do but tongu^ whip him madam and care not,
And so I leave him to the mercy of your tongue,

Eli. My tongue shall have hell and no mercy in it

Enter the Count. Excellent music exellent m^sicke.


El. And the Devil take the Instrument,


Count. What art thou so nigh.


Eli. I and it were a good deed to be a little nier too, you make a Count ass
of me indeed, as if I were too little for you, but bigness is my fault
unless I were a little better vsd at your hands.


Cou. Why thou will be to perfect if I should use thee much for use makes
perfitnesse.


Eli. I but I cannot be too perfect and the^fore I Will spoil her perfections that
helps to spoil mine I warrant her.


Cou. Why may not I lie with her as well as thou layest with her husband.


Eli. I defy you and all the world that can say black is mine eye.


Count. I think so indeed, for thine eye is gray, but thou did lie with him
by that same token he gave thee a carknet, and thou toldst me that thy mother
sent it thee, thou did promise to banquet him when I was next abroad, thou
did say he could not be so old as he made himself to be, thou d^dst say it was
pity of his nose, for he would have been a fine man else, and that God did
well to make him a rich man, for a was a good man too, and these tokens I
think are sufficient, ^or these a told me with his own mouth.


Eli. He lied like an old knave as he was and that he shall know the next time
these lips open in faith, oh wicked periurd man would a d^sclose my secrets
I faith what woman would trust any man a live with her honesty.

But I Will follow her and make her mad with anger.

Enter Porus king of Aethiopia, Resus king of Arabia, Bion king of Phasiaca,
Beb^tius (...) of Bebritia, with soldiers and (...) (...) (...). Porus. Thus
have we trod the sandy vales of Egypt,
Adjoining to the plains of Alexan^ria,
Where proud king ` (...) keeps his refidence,
Securely trusting to his prophesies,
Which has foretold him many years ago,
That if the young Archadian Doricles,
Should link in marriage with his lovely daughter.
He then should conquer all our bordering (...),
And make us subject to his tirrannie.

The. Trusting to his fond fantastic dreams,
He has exild the warlicke Duke Cleanthes.
Whose name was terror to our valiant troops.

Bion. Cleanthes exild gives us easy way,
To our attemptes where had he stayed,
And been afreind to him, yet should he not
Escape subjection.

Be. We will divide his kingdom twixt us four,
And reaue from him his four chief ornaments,
And for to grieve his aged mind the more,
He shall b^ kept in lasting servitude.
So to fulfill what fates to him assignde,

P^. Come let us march and brave him at the walls,
If Porus live to weild his martial sword,
His City walls shall not preserve him safe,
But he shall dye by Porus and his freindes.

Enter Doricles and Aspasia. D^. Sweet madam grant me once a cheerful look
To glad my dying heart with sorrow killed,

Aspa. Wicked Count Hermes for this monsterous (...),
Egypt will hate thee. and thou sure must dye,
Then hye thee to the hills beyond the Aipes,
Fly tovnknowne and unfrequented climes,
Some des ert place that never saw the sun,
For if the king or any of his friends,
Shall find Count Hermes thou art surely dead.

Count. I Will fly no more then does a settled rock,
No more then mountains or the steadfast powles,
But come sweet love if thou will come with me,
We two will live amongst the shadowy groves,
And we will sit like shepherdes on a hill,
And with our heavenly voices tice the trees,
To echo sweetly to our (...) tunes.
Fls will I angle in the running brooks,
Seasoning our toils with kiss, on the banks,
Sometime I Will diue into the murmerrng springes,
And fetch thee stones to hang about thy neck,
Which by thy splendour will be turned to pearl,
Say fair Aspasia will thou walk with me.

As. No bloody Count but I will clear my self,
And tell thy murders to the amassed court.

Count. Nay if thou will not choose you peevish girl
Thou can not say but thou were offered fair,
But here m^st end Count (...) strange disguise,

No more must hide me in the countes attire,
Now will I turn my gown to Usurers Cotes,
And thus appear unto the world no more,

Where never heavens light may shine on thee,
Whose there, Come forth for here is murder done,
Murder Murder of good prince Doricles.
Enter Euribates. Who calls out murder Lady was it you.


As. As I was walking in the pleasant weeds,
With Doricles the young Archadian prince,
rusht in Count Hermes and in desperate words,
Has slain this prince.

Eu. A balefull deed pursue the murderer,
And tell the King of this foul accident

Enter Ptolomy. Pto. Oh tell no more in stead of tears,
M^ beating heart dissolues in drops of blood,
And from mine eyes that stares upon this corse.
Leapes out my soul and on it I will die,
Oh Doricles oh dear Arca^ prince,
The bulwark and supporter of my life.
That by decree of fates was promised,
To add four neighbor kingdoms to my crown,
And shield me from a most abhorred death,
Now shall my kingdom leave me with my life,
And suddenly look for some monsterous fate,
Shall fall like thunder on my wretched state.
Enter a messenger. Arm arm my Lord, my Lords to instant arms,
Four mighty kings are landed in thy coast,
And threaten death and ruin to thy land,
Black (...) the (...) king,
Comes marching first with twenty thousand men,
Next Rhesus king of sweet Arabia,
In warlicke manner marches after him,
In equal number and in battle ray,
Next B^n king of rich Phasiaca,
And stern Bebritius of Bebritia,
With each of them full twenty thousand strong
All which has vowed the death, of Ptolomy, and thus they hither bend their
speedy feet.


Pto. How sodaynely is weather over cast,
How is the face of peaceful Egypt changd,
Like as the smiling flowers above the ground,
By keenest edge of E^ras breath is cut.

Cl. To arms my Lord and gather up your strength,
Your bands in Memphis and in Caspia,
Joined with your power of Alexandria,
Will double all the forces of these kings,

Pto. All shall be done we may mean while,
Bury the body of this slaughtered prince,
Least with the view my senses follow his,
Cursed be his hand that wrought the damned deed,
Cold and uncovered may his body lie.
Let stotmie hayle and thunder beat on him
And every bird and beast run over him,
That robbed poor Ptolomy of such a hope,
Pursue the desperate Count that murdered him,
A thousand kingdoms shall not save his life
Enter Leon. A miracle a miracle, a dreadful miracle.


Pto. What miracle, oh what will heavens do more,
To punish Egypt and her hapless king,

Leon As I was walking through the Serian groves
I saw the desperate Count the murderer,
Of good prince Do^icles as I hear say,
Fly through the deserts to the mimphick shades
Where hell to interrupt his passage thither,
Rauing beneath the ground work of the earth
As if ten thousand vapors burst in her,
Severed her womb and swallowed quick,
The miserable Count.

Pto. Just are the heavens in his most dreadful end,
But come my Lords let us to instant arms,
To drive away more mischeiefes from our land.
Exeunt.
Leon. So get you gone and p^ish all with him,
Now shall you know what want you have of me,
Now will I gather up my sommes of money,
And of my creditors borow what I can,
Because as Leon I Will be seen no more,
This day they promisd for to meet me here,
And here comes some of them.
Enter first Messenger. My master sir your friend Calatius, Has sent you sir
your five hundredth crowns for the rich Jewel that he bought of you. I thank
him heartily, this Jewel of so many thousand crowns The Queen of Egypt did
bestow on me, when that I told her in poor Jrus shape where her Cleanthes
was, but soft who hau^ we here.

Enter second Messenger. Druso the Italian Merchant here by me,
Has sent you sir in Diamonds and in Pearls,
So much as mounteth to five thousand crowns,
And craves no more assurance but your word,

Leon. There Is my bill and thank thy master he shall have more then word.

Exeunt. Manet Leon. Never shall he nor they see this again,
Nor me neither as I am this present man,
This with the rest I have will make a pretty sum
With this will I imploye ^e in these wars,
Now will I take on me the form and shape,
Of Duke Cleanthes, but what intendes this alarm*
Alarm. Enter Clearchus. Where may I seek to find Cle^thes out,
That martial prince whom Ptolomy unkind,
Has banished from out the Egyptian Land,
Our warlike troops are scatered and over throne,
And his dear freindes Acatos and Acanthes,
Lie in the field besmired in their ^loodes,
I Will run through al these groves to find him out.
Exit
Le. My sweet Acates and Acanthes slain,
Grief to my heart and sorrow to my soul,
Then rouse thy self Cleanthes and revenge.
Their guiltless blood on these base miscreantes
Oh let the cankred trumpet of the deep,
Be ratled out and ring into their ears,
The dire revenge Cleanthes will inflicte,
One these four Kings and all there accomplices,
Ala^um Excursions,
Enter Cleanthes leading Porus, Rhesus, Bion, Bebritius, Pego, Clearchus
Euribatus. Clean. Thus have you strove in vain against those Gods,
That rescues Egypt in Cleanthes arms,
Come yield your crowns and homages to me,
Though Ptolomie is dead yet I survive,
Elect and chosen by the pears to scourge,
The vile persumption of your hated lives,
Then yield as vanquished unto Aegypts king.

Po. First by thy valor and the strength of arms,
Porus the welthie Ethiopian king,
Does yield his crown and homage unto thee,
Swearing by all my Gods whom I adore,
To honor Duke Cleanthes whilst he live,
And in his aid with twenty thousand men,
Will always march gaynst whom thou meanst to fight,

By. Bion whose neck was never forct to bow
Does yield him captive to thy warlike sword,
Command what so thou list, we will perform,
And all my power shall march at thy command.

The. Rhesus does yield his crown and dignity,
To great Cleanthes Aegyptes only strength,
For if Cleanthes lives, who ever lived,
More likelier to be monarke of the world,
Then here accept my vow^ allegiance,
Which as the rest I render unto thee.

Bebri. So says Bebritius of (...).
And lays his crown and homage at thy feet,

Clean. Hold take your crowns again and keep your other and fealties to me,
So shall you live as free as here to fo^e
And near hereafter stoop to conquest more.

the beggar and the king, little know they that both their husbands are turned
into one king, there would be old st^iuing who should be Queen I faith.


Eli. Pity dread sovereign.


Sa. Pity gracious Lord.


Clean. What are your suits.


Eli. I the poor countess and the widow left,
Of late Count Hermes having all my goods,
seazd to our late kings use for murder done,
Of young prince Dorules humbly pray your grace,
I may have somewhat to mainetayne my state,
And this poor bu^ then which I go withal.
The hapless Infant of a hapless father.

Sa. And I my Lord humbly entreat your grace.
That where my husband Leon is deceast,
And left me much in debt, his creditors
Having seized all I have into their hands,
And turned me with this hapless burden here,
Into the streets your highness will descend,
To my relief by some convenient order.

Clean. Poor souls I most extremely pity them,
But say is Leon dead,

Clear. Men say my Lord he cast his desperate body,
From Thalexandrian tower into the sea.

C^an. Who saw the sight, or gave out this report,
You master Burgomaister.

Pe. I did my gracious Lord.


Clean. So I deuisd indeed that he should say,
That none should never look for Leon more
But these my widows here must not be left,
unto the mercy of the needy world,
Nor mine own Issue that they go withal,
Have such base fortunes and there fire so great,
Widows in pity of your widowhood,
And untimely ends of both your husbands,
The slaughter of the Count your husband madam,
Shall Be remitted* and your self enjoy,
The utmost of the living he possessed,
So will I pay your husband Leons debt,
And both shall live fitting there wonted states,
Kings in there mercy come most near the Gods,
And can no better show it then in ruth,
Of widows and of children fatherless,
My self will therefore be to both your birthes,
A careful father in there bringing up.

Ambo. The Gods for ever bless your majesty,


Cle. But tell me were your husbands such bad men,
That every way they did deserve such ends,

Eli. Mine was a husband to my hearts content.
But that he vsd the privilege of men.

^lean What privilege of men,


Eli. To take some other love besides his wife
Which men think by their custom they may do,
Although their wives be strictly bound to them.

^lean. With whom suspectyou he was great with all.


Eli. With this poor widow here the world supposes.


Sa. So thinks the world my husband was with you.

Clean. Well master Burgomaister see that you restore,
The goods and lands you ceasd.

Not p^ie of their wido ^odes alone,
But their rare beauties move me to this good.

welcome you home from war^.
Enter Martia with a child. Oh husband hu^and will you go to ^re, and leave me

Po. We did my Lord and wonder at his courage


The. His merit does deserve a better place.
Then to be Burgomaister of Alexandria.

Cle. Then say my Lords how shall we deal with him.


By. Had he been widower he might have wedded with this countess here.


Pe. Oh I have one of mine own I thank you sir, here is one has the sweet of
them I faith:


Po* My Lord the offer had been to hye a grace for him
For near did eye behold a fayrer face.

Be. So says mine eye that has my heart incenst.


By. And Rhesus me thinks this exceedes her far,


The. No question of it as the son a star.


Po. As sodaynely as lightning beauty wounds.


Be. None ever loud but at first sight they loud*


Po. Loves darts are swift as is the lightning fire.


The. See he shootes arrows bur^ing from her eyes.


Po. Why which loves Rhesus.


The. This celestial dame.


Po And which loves Bion*


By. Even the very same.


Po. Then may I freely Joy the countess here.


Be. No Porus for B^itins loves her too


Cle. Are they in love oh Gods would that were true
My loving joy the fresh desire of kings.
How now my Lords does beauty startle you*

Po. More then dead stocks would startle at such beauty,


Be* In vain do I resist my passions,
Mighty Cleanthes to annex ^y heart,
In love to thee as well as victory,
Grant this fair countess here may be my queen.

Po. No great Cleanthes give her to my hand,
Whose heart was first the subject of her graces.

The. Then let the Arabian king make this his queen.


By. Nay this ^eanthes let my love enjoy.


Cle. How fatal are these loves now I perceive,
Their fortunes that I told as I was Irus.
Will now in force I see be come to pass.

Sa. Oh holy Irus blessed be thy tongue,
That like an orator has told our fortunes.

Eli. He told us we should soon lose our first loves,
Making our second choice among greatest kings.

C^ I did indeed, but God knows knew not how.


Pe. How say you master brother, am not I secret now*


Cl^. Thou art and be so still for not the world,
Shall ever know the mad prankes I have played,
Now stand sayre my Lords and let these Ladies view you,

(...) In my eye now the blackest is the fairest,
For every woman chooses white and red,
Come martial Perus thou shall have my love.

Be. Out on thee foolish woman thou have chose a devil.


Pe. Not yet sir til he have horns.


Sa. It Is not the face and color I regard,
But fresh and lovely youth allures my choice.
And thee most beauteous Bion I affecte.

The. Hapless is Rhesus.


Bebri. Accursed ^britius.


Cle. Have patience gentle Lords I will provide,
Other Egyptian Ladies for your t^ne,
So will we link in perfect league of lou^
So shall the victory you lost to me,
Set double glory on your conquered he^des.
So let us go to frolic in our Court.
Carousing free whole boules of greekish win^*
In honor of the conquest we have made,
That at our banquet all the Gods may tend,
Plauding our victory and this happy end.
Ex^.
FINIS.
