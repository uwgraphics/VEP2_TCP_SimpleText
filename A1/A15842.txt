A pleasant new Northern Song. called the two York -- shire Lovers.
To a pleasant new Court tune, Or, the tune of Willy.


WHen Willv once he stayed,
To fetch home a lamb that straied,
under a hill side,
a bonny Less he spide,
Of whom he was well apaied.
Her cheeks like Cherries growing.
Her lips like Rose-buds blowing,
her eyes black and clear,
as the Sloe upon the breere,
Or the worm in the hedge lies glowing
Her waste so small and slender,
Her skin so soft and tender,
he sighed and he said,
that she was a fair Maid,
And his love to her he would render.
The wind did seem to play,
With her tresses as she lay,
betwixt hope and fear,
He was in despairs,
To give her the time of the day.
Yet resolved to court this Minion,
There stepped in a new opinion:
this timorous Clown,
thought Phaebe had come down,
To speak with her loved Endimion.
His errand quite forgotten,
He leaned to a tree was rotten,
he swore by the Mass,
there was never such a Less,
His heart with a shaft was shotten.
Then boldly he stepped unto her,
His eyes shot affection through her,
he cast away fea^es,
and pricking up his ears,
Thus Willy began to woo her.
Good day (quoth he) my honny,
Thou dearer to me than money,
I Will lose my little Lamb,
And gladly give the Damme,
To lig with a Less so bonny.
Now list to what I Will tell thee,
There Is none in shape does excel thee,
so thou will wed me,
none happier than thee;
Nor better day ere befell me.
Of Nuts I Will give thee plenty,
And red side Apples twenty,
my butter I Will leese,
to make thee summer Cheese,
And Cream to make Egg pies dainty.
My Lambs new gowns shall bear thee,
No daglockes shall ere come near thee,
the Poultry of the Town
shall cackle without Down,
Ere I Will want a soft bed to cheer thee.
My Bagpipes mirth shall make thee,
Each morn with a Song I Will wake thee
at night I Will not fail,
to tell a merry tale,
And make thy sad thoughts forsake thee.
The second part. To the same tune.


WHite Lillies shall paue the Closes,
Each brier shall blush with Roses,
the grass green and sweet,
shall kiss thy tender feet.
And the Medows shall yield thee posies.
With shady bowers set ore thee,
With thousand contents I Will store thee,
while by some clear brook,
with my little Dog and hook,
I Will bring my fine Ewes before thee.
While thus he was close set at her,
(Quoth she) I suspect the matter,
for an hours sport,
like the false alluring Court,
The Country has learned to flatter.
Therefore leave off thy wooing,
I love not such short doing,
and come unto the matter,
I love not for to flatter,
True affection hates long suing.
But if your love will prove steady,
Till Hymen had made him ready,
then surfeit all night,
in a captive Maids delight,
Which yet but air has fed ye.
Quoth he I love none above thee,
For chastity I prove thee,
as constant I Will prove,
as the Mate unto the Dove,
Nay, though thou were dead, I Will love thee
And all contents I Will give thee,
So that thou will live with me*
my life and all I Will loose,
ere I my Love abuse,
And all my rich kith unto me.
As Willy thus was talking,
The Shepherds eyes were walking*
each leg and each limb,
so tricked so trim,
She thought it no time of balking*
Her heart with love was taken,
God Cupi^ did her awaken,
and cast a cheerful eye,
upon him by and by,
To show he was not forsaken.
His lips to hers he laid,
She never a word gaine-said:
thus joining their hands,
they tied the Nuptial bands,
Which never till death decai'd.
Such happy joy God send me,
When I to wed intend me,
and to each faithful Lover:
where they be one or other,
I heartily commend thee.
FINIS.
