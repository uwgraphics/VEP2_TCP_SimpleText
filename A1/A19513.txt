A TREATISE of the Heavenly MANSIONS.
My help is in the name of the Lord.
JOHN 14. 1. And Jesus said to his Disciples: Let not your hearts be troubled:
Ye believe in God, believe also in me.
AT this Chapter These words contain: 1 A Comfort: 2 A Confirmation of it.
begins the Legacy, or latter Will, of our lord Christ Jesus, and ^ontinues to
the eighteen. In the entry thereof, he first comforts his Disciples against
the fear^ of all evil which may trouble them: and next by strong arguments
confirms the Comfort. In In the Comfort are three circumstances.
the Comfort three Circumstances are to be considered: First, who gives it?
Christ Jesus: Secondly, to whom? to his Disciples. Thirdly, the Comfort it
self; Let not you^ heart be troubled, proponed, as you see, by 1 First
circumstance, he who gives the Comfort is Christ.
way of Exhortation.

Out of the first Circumstance appears the superabundant love o^ Jesus toward
his own. He is now entering to his ^loudy Passion, which troubled him sore, yet
he cares not for himself, all his care is for them, that they should not be
troubled. O what a love! No such love in the world, as our Lord has showed us.
where shall we find the like of it? Many examples of rare love have we in
holy Story, in the common, yea, and in nature also; but none like this: Here is
a love, the length, the breadth, the height, the depth whereof none is able to
comprehend.

love, but not comparable to the love of Christ toward us.
the creature, but as I said, this love of Jesus ouercomes them al: he came in
the shape of a servant, to make us freemen: he was content to be bound, that
his Beniaminites, that is, the sons of his right hand, might be restored to
their Father: he keeps the kingdom as heir and only begotten Son of the
Father, and gives the kingdom to us conque^ed by him, as our Goel and ^insman,
who has redeemed our inheritance: he ^eceiued in his blameless ^ody the
stripes which were due to our sins: He has borne our infirmities, Esaias 53 4.
5
and carried our sorrows: he was wounded for our transgressions, and broken
for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peac^ was upon him, and with hi^
stripes are we healed. He^ is that Good Shepherd who gave his life for hi^
Sheep; he is that true Pelican, who saw the fieri^ wrath of God burning about
his young ones, an^ cast himself into the midst thereof, that he might quench
it; he knew the terror thereof, yet he fled it not; he longed with great
desire to eat that ^t Passover, albeit he ^ew it would be a sup^r of sour

The second Circum^tance 2 Second circumstance, to whom is this Comfort given.

leads us to consi^er, to whom is this comfort given? To his Disciples: ^ot to
the twelve only, ^ut as afterward the Lord expounds himself; ^ pray not for
these alone, but for them also who sha^ believe in me through their word. This
Legacy the^ pertaines not to the twelve Disciples only first preachers of the
Gospel after Christ Jesus but belongs also to a^ that to the worlds en^

Let not your heart be troubled.
THE third Circumstance 3 Third circumstance, the Comfort it self sufficient
against all fear of evil which may trouble us.
is in these words: and it contains the Comfort it self; Le^ not your heart
be troubled I have forewarned yo^ of many things which (...) know are grievous
vnt^ you: I have told you o^ my suffering, that one o^ my Disciples will betra^
me, and that the best o^ them will deny me, an^ that I my self must go^ from
you, and whither (...) go you cannot com^ now. These heavy spee^hes did (no
doubt) asto^ish and confound them, and cast down their hearts ^to the gulf of
excee^ing sorrow: and there^re comes he in here to ^ise them up again and
^mfort them. But how^euer the occasion of ^is Doctrine arises of ^e former
premonitions, ^et we may epsy in them complete consolation, ^uen unto us by
our lord, against all that may ^ouble us.

There are two evils, ^e fear whereof trou^les men: first, the fear of sin;
next, the fear^ Two things men fear, Sin and Death.

wickedly: only they fear Death and Judgment they cannot eschew it, al^
their care is to delay it. In Wicked men fear nothing more then death, till
death come, then are they vexed with fear of their sin.
their death by the contrary, they fear nothing so much as their sin now
they fly death, a^ the center of their sor^ rows; then they sha^ seek it, as
the remedy o^ their remorses. There i^ no death so horrible which they would
not ^illingly embrace, proui^ed it might free them ^om the conscience of ^eir

But the godly in their But the godly in their life fear nothing more then
their sins.
^fe fear nothing so much ^s their sins: they ^ourne for former sins, and
with good Ezekiah, ^ecount them in the bitter^esse Esaias.
of their soul: they ^ght against present sins, ^anding with the armor ^f God
upon them, and ^rough his grace ouer^ome it: they are in continual fear of
sin t^ come; if it renew the for^ they are still making preparation to resist
it. An^ And therefore fears no death when it comes.
therefore they fear n^ death, at least are not ^ uercome with the fea^
thereof; they defy it, the provoke it, they preue^ it; I mean, they know will
come, but ere it con^ they desire it, and are pr^pared for it ere it be

to fight ^oth against the terrors of sin, and horror of death. It is a
godly po^icie in the spiritual warfare, to divide your enemies; first overcome
your sins, vanquish them ere ^he forces of death can ^oyne with them; so
shall ^ou not be afraid to en^ounter with death; for Death is a biting Serpent,
and Sin is the sting ^ereof: take the sting from the Serpent, and without
danger you may ^mbrace it. Take Sin away, and Death shall n^ be terrible.

Against both these ^uils Complete Comfort against both these fears given here.
the Lord Jesus he^ furnishes us with sufficient comfort: against the fear of
sin he sets the buckler of Faith, which is able to quench the fie^darts

premits the comfortable Exhortation, Le^ ^t your heart be trou^ed.

For understanding No exemptions from trouble promised to Christians.
^hereof we must con^der two things: first, ^at our Savior here ^omiseth us
not exemp^on from trouble: next, ^at he requires not we ^ould be without all
^nse of trouble. The first ^euident, he has plainly ^ld us, In the world you

faith in the ^ther two: for albeit the persons be three, the essence is one.

And again, there is ^o comfort in the Father, without the Son, ^eyther can

consolation. But of this, he who pleases may* read our Treatise of the Baptism

Verse 2. In my Fathers house are many dwelling places: If it were not so, I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
HItherto have 2 Comfort confirmed against the fear of Death.

Where the Lord confirms us ^ainst the offense we ^ght conceive of his ^ath,
and against the ter^rs might arise of our ^ne death, and that which may follow
it.

This comfort proceeds This comfort proceeds by three degrees.
by three degrees In the first is proposed meditation of the man^ Mansions
which are i^ our Fathers house. The comfort meets our fea^ this way; if death
afra^ you, if the grave see^ horrible to you, if it yerksome to rememb^ that
which Job has; E^ 1 The first degree of comfort against death and the grave,
is the meditation of heavenly mansions.

upward to my Fa^ers House where many ^ansions are: Death ^all not be able to
de^ure you, the grave shall ^t detain you from ^ese everlasting Taberna^ where
the place of ^ur rest and Mansion This is the first degree the Comfort, and is
^ntained in these words. Death a compend of all crosses has need of the
greater consolation.
As Death is the way of flesh, so is it the com^nd of all crosses: in it ^e
soul naturally is ^ubled with fears, the ^dy with pains. It is the last
enemy, which g^ thereth all forces mi^tant under it, to the la^ battle. It is
with us as was with Israel when the came out of Egypt, o^ nation of the
Egyptia^ pursued them, but wh^ they entered into Cana^ seven nations of
Can^nites joined their forc^ to hold them out. In o^ life every man has h^
several crosses and tenttions: one has health (...) body, but wrestleth wi^
poverty, not having (...) feed his body: anoth^ has abundance, but hat^ not
his health to use i^ some want sight of their eyes, but hear well e^ough:
others see, but ^eare not at all: one is ^ained in his outward ^lesh, another
with some ^ntestine disease: in one ^here is a whole body, but (...) wounded
Spirit. If in If it be difficult to bear one cross in our life, how shall we
bear many concurring in our death without preparation.
^ur life we gather not ^trength against one cross or two, how shall ^ee
endure in death to ^ight with them all? Were ^hou never so rich, poor and
naked thou must go to the grave; arm ^hee against poverty, ^earne to want
those things which thou have, before they be taken from thee: were thy sight as
quick as the Eagles it shall wax dim, They Eccles. 12. 3.
shall wax dark that look out at the window: the strong men shall bow
themselves, and the grinders shall cease, etc. Thy senses shall fail thee,
yea, thy heart also, thy beautiful flesh must putrify and rot, thou must go
to the house of Verse 5.
thine age; and all that are thine shall for sake thee. In a word armtes of
sorrows, Lam. 2. 22.
fears and terrors, as in a solemn day, shall be gathered round about thee.
And therefore great need have we to arm our selves against that day of
battle, and specially to lay up in ^ur hearts these consola^ons of God, which
our ^auiour here leaves us in ^is Legacy.

In this first degree of The first degree of comfort has in it four
circumstances.
^he Comfort four cir^umstances are to be con^idered: first, who is this ^e
calls his Father: second^, what is his Fathers ^ouse: thirdly, what are ^hese
mansions: fourth^y, what is meant here by ^any mansions.

As for the first, the ^ame of a Father is either ^ttribute to God
indefinitely, and so is common 1 First Circumstance, who is this whom Christ
calls his Father.

rest of the styles given unto Jesus, he is called, a^ everlasting Father; an^

then the relation respect The name of Father how it is attributed to the three
persons, and how to the first person only of the blessed Trinity.
eth all his creatures: o^ else particularly it is ascribed to the first person
and then the relation does principally respec^ Christ, and that in bot^ his
natures. Secondly; al^ the children of his good wi^ to whom by grace i^ Christ
he is become a father. Most comfortable i^ this for us, that he who i^ ^he
Father of our Lord jesus Christ by an vn^eakable generation: for ^ho can
declare it? is also ^ecome our Father in ^im: I ascend to my God, and your God;
to my father, and to your father. And ^hen we pray he has ^ommanded us to
call upon God as upon our ^ther; yea, he has sent own his Spirit into our
arts by whose secret in^rmation we are taught ^ith filial confidence to ^y
unto him, Abba Fa^er. Happy time for us, ^at so we may call him.

The second Circumstance leads us to a consideration 2 Second Circumstance,
what is this he calls his Fathers house* Esaias 66. 1. 1 Kin. 8. 27
of his Father house; The heaven (sait^ the Lord) is my throne, an^ the earth
is my foot-stool^ where then is his house yea, as Solomon says, T^ heavens,
and the heavens ^ heavens are not able to co^taine him: the Lord is uery where,

he shows his terror, t^ them on earth he shew^ his goodness, to them i^
heaven he shows h^ glory, what then is the he calls his Father house?
This speech ^ borrowed from the manner of Kings, who albeit the whole Kingdom
be theirs, yet have they some place of residence, which more properly is
called the Kings house: even so by this house, which our ^auiour calls his
Fathers house, is understood that place of glory wher^n he shows his secret
and most familiar presence to his Saints: this is the house 2 Cor. 5.
not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens: this is the City having a
foundation, Heb. 11. 10
whose builder and maker is God: this is the City which needs not Sun Reu.

nor Moon. This is the Paradise of God, the inner A commendation of our
Fathers house
Court of the palace of God, the heaven of heavens, the holy of holiest. S.
Pau^ calls it, the third Heavens; he saw it, but could not reveal the glory
of it; he contents him to tell what it was not, but takes not in hand to tell
what it was ^ he describes it negative, we shall know it when we shall see
it; till then no heart of man can understand it. The Christian by course has
residence in three houses: The first was his mothers womb, there he soiourned
by months. The second is this world, wherein he ^oiourneth by years. The
^hird is heaven, wherein ^re the everlasting Taber^acles: and there the
chri^tian shall dwell for ever. Of this comparison will ^ppeare the glory of
our ^hird house, whereof who ^o pleases to read more, ^s likewise of that
comfort we have of this, that God the Father of our Lord Jesus, is also become
^ur Father in him, may ^ee it at greater length in ^ur treatises on the eight
^o the Romans, and Defiance of Death.

The third circumstance 3 Third circumstance what is meant by Mansions, to wit,
indurance to all eter^tie.
is in the word Mansions, and it imports the endurance and eternity of that
house, and them which dwell in it: it is no soiourning house, no place for
pilgrims, but our mansion place The earth is stable and moves not, yet all
things in it are in a continual motion, we never stand in one estate: from
the womb our course is to the grave without any resting. The heavens are again
in a perpetual motion, and yet above them has the Lord prepared our mansion.
That petition of the Church is a meet prayer ^r us; O thou whom my Cant. 1.
^ule loves, show me where There the great shepherd rests and feeds his
flock, but not here.
^ou ^eedes, and rests at the ^one day. Here the Lord ^edes us, but here the
lord rests n^ot; here is ght, but not the light of ^e noone day. No, no, ^e
Sun in his meridi^ light, extends not so ^rre, the morning twight, as the
lightsome ^ory of our mansions ^ceeds the greatest glo^ man can have in his
^lgrimage. As the great ^ies of Campania seem ^t little cottages to them who
stand on the top^ the Alps, and as the moo^ covers her self with pale vale,
and shines n^ at all in presence of t^ Sun, so all the beau^ and glory of
this eart^ shall vanish, when that gl^ry of the Sons of God she be revealed.

of ^e Lord, men are not ^akened to learn the in^bility of things that ^e

are they in this, that they dare derogate from the sufficiency and perfection
of his Priestly office. He has offered himself once, and once only, and
that for all his own, a ^ropitiatorie sacrifice, for the full satisfaction of
his Fathers Justice: yet are not they ashamed to say, that he has satisfied
for us only in a part, and that which he has not done must be supplied by
our own satisfactions, or of others for us. But if these ^gnorant men had but
a taste of that bitter cup which our Savior drank for our sins, the horror
whereof made him to sweat a bloody sweat, they would feel and be forced to
confess that it were impossible for any creature to make satisfaction to
divine Justice for the smallest sin tha^ ever was committed by man. Neither
can thi^ blasphemy be excuse^ by this pretense, that ou^ works and sufferings
be^ come satisfactory by the virtue of Christ's merit^ for the meriting and
satisfactorie power of Christ is personal; He has by Heb. 1. 3.

Saints the benefit of his merits, but not the power of meriting: that is the
glory of a Savior, which he reserueth to himself and will not give to
another. And as it is perso^all, so it is perfect: he ^ath in such sort done
his work for us by himself, that he has not left any part thereof to be one
or supplied by ano^er: for which we have ^at most clear testimo^ie of the
holy Oracle: ^ee is able perfectly to save Heb. 7. 25.

Come to me, I will refresh you: In my Fathers house there is room enough for
you; Come and see, O daughter, hearken and consider, and Psalm. 45. 10 11.
incline thine ear, forget also thine own people, and thy Fathers house, so
shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty. Oh that we might answer the Lord
with that voice of true Israelites captiued in Babel: If I Psalm. 137. 5. 6.
forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget (to play;) if I do not
remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: if I prefer not
Jerusalem to my chief joy: We are here in a strange land, shall we forget Our
Sion and Jerusalem which is above. Alas, that we are bewitched with the
pleasures of Babel, and do not long as we should to see our Fathers house, that
we may be for ever with the Lord.

I go to prepare a place for you.
THe second degree of 2 The second degree of the comfort, is a consideration of
the right we have to these heavenly mansions.
the comfort is in these words: the disciples and others his Saints might have
said, Lord, it is joyful for us to hear of thy Fathers house, and of the many
Mansions which are in it; but what is that unto us? what right or interest have
we in it? To this doubt, the Lord opposes this second degree of comfort;
wherein that which he spoke generally in the first, he applies particularly
to them: the Mansions of my Fathers house are for you and such as you are: I
shall make you a right unto them; for this cause came I into the world; for
this cause go I unto my Father, that I may prepare a place for you.

This comfort is most Without this, the first degree of comfort could not
avail us. And why?
necessary: for what auails it unto us to hear of the joys of that life to
come, and of the glory of that kingdom, unless we know, that it belongs unto
us? The wicked hears tell of it, but shall ever see it, yea, they may st of
the powers of the life come, but shall never en^y them. These are cur^d with a
curse more ^arefull than that of the ^amaritan Prince, he beeued not the word
of ^e Lord, spoken by Eli^a the Prophet, that Saaria then straited with ^amine,
should have plen^ of victual upon the ^orrow; thou shall see with 2 Kin. 7. 2.

loosed from the body, flies joyfully unto the Lord, and there enioyes that
happiness which in heaven is laid up for it.

But no less cruel and But more comfortles and cruel are they when they send
down infants unbaptized, to a house of hell, baptized by themselves and called
Infernus no^ baptizatoru^
merciles are they toward young children dying without Baptism: for these, if
the want of Baptism be not supplied by martyrdom, they condemn to another
house of hell, which they cal^ infernus non baptizatorum the hell of such as
are no^ baptized. Our Savior commanded to bring the young children, and sai^
of such is the kingdom (...) heaven, but these new doctors will banish young
ones from him, and grant them no place in his kingdom. S. Paul says, that
children of believing Parents are holy, being born within the Covenant; but the
Pope sends them down to a house in hell, for want of the seal of the
Covenant: But because they still brag of Antiquity, we will let you hear the
voice of Antiquity plainly against them. This cruel opinion is condemned by
Augustine.


First, of this purpose Augustine writes in this manner. Proinde respuendi sunt
a cord Christiano, qui putant ideo dictum multas esse mansiones, quod extra
regnum coeloru^ erit aliquid, vbi maneant beati innocents, qui sine Baptismo
ex hac vita emigrarunt, quia sine illo in regnum ^alorum intrare non poterunt.
Therefore they are to be rejected, yea, spewed out of a Christian heart, who
think, because our Savior says, there are many Mansions, that therefore
without the kingdom of Heaven, there is some place, wherein blessed innocents,
dying without Baptism shall remain, because without it they Let Catholic
Romans consider what fals^ Catholics they are in Augustine his mind.
cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven: Haec ^ides non est fides, quia non
^st vera and Catholica fides: This faith is no faith, because it is no true
Catho^ique faith. Dare ye so di^ide the house of our Father, that some Mansions
thereof ye make to be in the kingdom of heaven, others of them without the
kingdom of Heaven? Absit vt ^ui volunt habitare in regno ^oelorum in hac
stultitia ve^int habitare vobiscum: Far ^e it from us, that they who would
dwell in the kingdom of heaven, should dwell with you in this foolish opinion.

With Augustine agrees With Augustine agrees Bernard. Ierem. 1. 5.
Bernard: I read, says he, that the Lord spoke of Jeremy, Before thou came
out of the womb, I sanctified thee: And of John the Baptist, Qui ex viero,
Dominum in vtero sensit, who in the womb of his own Mother Elizabeth was
touched with a feeling of his Lord, in the womb of Marie the blessed Virgin;

spirit, he cannot enter into ^he kingdom of Heaven. ^ernard there improues
that sense, and by forci^le reasons euinces, that it is not the meaning of
Christ in that place, establishing this conclusion, that the want of Baptism
cannot be pr^iudiciall to salvation, Tantum si aqu^ non contemptus sed sola
prohibeat impossibilitas, providing it be not the contempt thereof, but
impossibility to get it, that causes the want of it. And to Ibid* Papists

word in the second degree of comfort is. To prepare.


The next word here is, of preparing, I go (says our Savior) to prepare:
This leads us by the hand to take up the greatness of that glory: for it must
be a great glory which is prepared by the Lord. And this will appear the
better by a twofold comparison: first, of the works of God with the works of
man: next, of the works That it must be a great glory which God prepares, will

cease to speak of those works, whereunto the luxurious humors of men have
carried them without necessity or any good use; as the Pyramides, the
Labyrinth, and Plin. lib. 36. cap. 14.

of them; Nulla alia aedificandae Pyramidis causa fuit, quam vana and stulta

was no other cause why the Kings of Egypt builded their Pyramides, one whereof
was twenty years in building, three hundred and threescore thousand men
continually working thereat, no other cause (says he) was of all this
unprofitable labor, but a vain and foolish ostentation, that neither their
money nor their men should be idle.

^eaue, and turn me to holy Scripture. Noah was an hundred and twenty years
preparing the Arc. No doubt, as the Lord commanded him to build ^t, so his
wisdom directed him how to build it. Here was a long preparation, and it
produced a great work: it behooued to be a great vessel, there were but eight
reasonable souls in it, Noah the Father, Iaphet, Sem and Cham, his three
Sons, with their wives, but beside these, it contained all kinds of
creatures, beasts of the earth, birds of the air, male and female. Of what
huge quantity it was, may appear by this; the Flood continued for Gen 7. 11.

Kingdom. O^ this Tertullian, in name o^ all the Saints, gloryeth i^ this
manner: Quemadmodum nobis aharabonem Spiritus reliquit, ita a nobis a^rabonem

The second point of 2 In intercession for us, that we may have the place

this preparation is his Intercession for us: Christ is not entered into the
holy places which are made with hands, and are similitudes ^f the true
Sanctuary, but ^s entered into the very heaven, to appear now in the ^ight of
God for us. Thus then prepares he that place for us, when by his continual

stands in his effectual operation in us, according as he promised; And I, if
I were lift up from the earth, will draw all men unto me, to wit, all that are
mine. Then prepares he that place for us, when by his attractiue virtue he
draws us up unto it: Parat quodammodo Aug. in Joan. tract. 68.
mansiones, cum mansionibus parat mansores: The Lord after a sort (says
Augustine) prepares a mansion place, when he prepares them who should remain
in it. Ita Domine, para quod paras, nos enim tibi paras, and t^ nobis paras,
cum locum paras, and tibi in nobis, and in te nobis; tu enim dixisti, Manete in
me, and ego in vobis: Even so, Lord, prepare that which thou art preparing, for
thou preparest us to thy self, and preparest thy self unto us, when thou
preparest a place for thy self in us, and for us in thee; for thou said,
Abide ye in me, and I in you. John 15.
S. Peter ioynes these two together; An inheritance 1 Pet. 1. 4. 5
kept in the heavens for us, and whereunto we are kept by the power of God
through faith. This is for our great comfort, that he who has prepared that
Kingdom for us, prepares us for it: he has ascended on high, and is now
drawing us up after him. We In the Mystical body all the life is in the head,
and he will not fail to draw all his members after him.
speak it of the natural body, where the head goes through, it will draw the
whole body after it: this is much more true in the mystical body; for whereas
in the natural body there are more vital parts then one, in the mystical
there is no vital part but the head: so long as there is life in the head, and
that shall be for ever; for Christ is now risen from the dead, and can dye no
more, the members shall not want life. Such as are in him feels virtue flowing
from him, to draw them up to himself, to renew and prepare them for these new
Heavens, wherein dwells righteousness, and into the which no unclean thing
can enter. Above all things let us take heed that we find this attractiue
virtue in our selves: for thereby shall we know that our Lord is preparing a
place for us in these heavenly Mansions.

Now that our Savior Limbus patrum altogether elumbat, can find no footing in
this place.
says, I go to prepare a place for you: we have showed ^n what sense he
says it. And therefore they are far mistaken who abuse this place, to prove,
that the way to the heavenly Mansions was vnpassa^le, and heaven inaccessi^le
before the resurrection and ascension of Christ: ^o affirm the Prolocu^ors
(...) on Heb. 9. v. 8.
for Babell, that the Patriarchs and other good men of the old Testament, were
in some other place of rest before the coming of Christ, and not in heaven;
and namely, that they were in a place called Limbus Patrum, which in their mind
is the uppermost house of hell. A strange opinion, as if there could be any
rest but in heaven, or that souls could have rest in any house of hell. And
with this they abuse another place of the Apostle to the Hebrews, The way Heb.
9. 8.
into the holiest of all was not yet opened, while as yet ^he first Tabernacle
was standing.

For answering whereof Another place vindicate from the h^nds of Papists which
they would abuse to prove that none of the godly before Christ, went into
heaven.
we must know, that the Apostles purpose there, is ^o declare unto the
Hebrews, that the service of the Leuiticall Priesthood and first Tabernacle,
could not of it self, give salvation, but figured that salvation which comes
by the blood of the high Priest. Now albeit the Leuiticall service of it (...)
could neither save Priest nor people, yet so many of them as were spiritual,
and in using of the Typical sacrifice, looked by the eye of faith unto the
true sacrifice, be^ leeuing remission of sin^ through the blood o^ Christ,
these were saue^ by faith in Christ t^ come, no less then we are saved by
faith in Christ that is come. And where the Apostle says, the way^ to heaven
was not open during the time of the first Tabernacle, it does not import, that
the way to heaven was closed all that time, but that it (...) not manifested
then (...) made so clearly apparen^ as now it is by the coming of Christ: for
the Apostle uses not the word (...), which signifies The difference of the
words (...) and (...), declares the way was open then albeit not so clear as
now.
to open that which was closed, but he uses the word (...), which signifies
to make manifest and clear a thing which is dark and obscure. Now there is a
great difference between these two; to say that the way of heaven was obscured
with shadows and couerings, which were removed by Christ's coming, and the way
to ^eauen more clearly manifested; and to say, that the way and door of heaven
was closed and locked up before, til Christ came and opened it: and therefore
the Jesuits themselves are forced to translate this word as I have alleged;
The way of the holiest was not yet manifested. They had the same Covenant of
Grace that we have, but they had it infolded and covered with figures and
shadows, we have it outfolded and clearly proponed without figure or shadow.
The Sun before his rising sends out a light, whereby any man that has eyes
may see the way wherein he should walk, but when it rises, it brings with it
a greater light, whereby the way is more clearly manifested. The Lord Jesus
before his in carnation sent out a light, which showed the way of salvation to
so many as were appointed for it, and by that light they walked unto it; but
much more clearly has he manifested it by his own coming. These words are
abused, when another sense is enforced upon them.

When Moses testifies of Henoch, that he walked with God, and he was no more
seen, for God took Genesis 5. 24. 2 Kin. 2. 11. When the Scripture says, God
took up Henoch and Eliah into heaven, if the doctrine of the Romish Church be
true, it must be said, they were carried down to a house in hell.
him away. The Doctors of Rome must make this Commentary upon it, God took him
away, that is, took him down to an house of hell called Limbus Patrum, or
else they must renounce their opinion: and where the Spirit of God says, that
Elijah went up by a whirlewinde into heaven, these babbling builders of Babell
will have it expounded this way; that he went down to Limbus: When Lazarus
dyed, his soul was carried by Angels into Abraham's bosom: now say they that
the ^lace called Abraham's ^osome is now in heaven, ^ut before Christ's death ^
was a place in hell, Limbus Patrum. But I pray ^ou what reasonable man ^ill
think that holy An^els carry the souls of ^en unto another place ^en that

^riting on that place of ^b, And naked shall I re^rne, says in this manner; I

went to his own place, and many beside the twelve that shall have place there,
^s afterward our Savior expounds himself. Always Particular application of Gods
promises, is necessary for our comfort.
we see it is not sufficient ^or true consolation to have a general sight of
eternal life, but a particular application of the promises thereof is
necessarily required in us. And this is the very essential difference which
distinguishes true justifying faith from all other kind^ of faith whatsoever.
The Papists mistake it farr^ when they teach there i^ no more in faith then

cum assensu, a knowledge with assent. For Papists mistake far the nature of
Faith, when they take from it this particular application.
suppose thou known the promises of eternal life, and assentest to them also,
that they are true i^ the general, if thou ha^ not the assurance (which
justifying Faith renders that they are thine, wha^ comfort have thou? The

says S. James: where ^f they thought and assented not to the truth of Gods
word, it would not move them at all, neither would they tremble for ^he
judgment more then they rejoice at the mercy. Thus have these reprobate
Spirits, an assen^ing knowledge, then the which no more is in the Papists
faith, according to their own doctrine.

And thus they mistaking From this they fall into another inconvenience, to deny

this life no man can b^ sure of salvation, unless it be by extraordinary

man is bound of faith ^o believe that he is certainly of the number of them

Doctrine. That a regenerate man may be and is sure of salvation is proved
against the Counsel of Trent.

Lord: fi^ Charter; secondly, Confirmation; thirdly, Sea^ing; fourthly,
Possession. 1 A Charter given him by the Lord.
Our Charter is the word of the Lord, and promises made us in the Gospel of
grace. There ^s one clause of our Charter, As the Father has appointed Luke
22. 29
a Kingdom to me, ^ol appoint it to you. There ^s another; Fear not little

^ocke, it is the Fathers will ^o give you the Kingdom. If reprobate man or
Angel would quarrel (as no doubt they will in the day of tentation) our ^ight
to the kingdom of heaven, we should have such principal clauses o^ our
Charter, registered i^ our hearts, to produce against them, that would disturb
our peace.

Secondly, we have the 2 A confirmation past thereupon.
Lords Confirmation pa^ upon our Charter. O^ this speaks the Apostle ^ So God

himself by an oa^ that by two immutable things wherein it is impossible the
God should lie, we might have strong consolation. T^ Lord has not only spoken
the word, but hat^ confirmed it with an ^ath, to show to the heirs ^f promise,
these are regenerate men, the stabili^e of his counsel: let the adversaries
mark this. Beside this, the death of ^e Testator has inter^ened, and has
subscri^ed the Testament with ^is own blood, and confirmed it in our hearts by
giving us his own Spirit, as his witness, his ^arnest and his own seal
assuring us that the promised salvation is ours. And therefore S. Paul speaking
to the Corinthians 1 Cor. 1. 6.
says, The testimony of God has been confirmed in you. Truth it is, many in
our days, know this Charter, and can speak of it, who have not the testimony
thereof confirmed in their hearts, but sure his Saints elected, called, and
justified have it.

Thirdly, we have our 3 A seasing conformab^e to his Charter.
Seasing given us, when his servants, Preachers of the Gospel, as his Deputies
and officers, in his name, seases and infefts us in his promised Kingdom: and
this is done upon earth, so often as they deliver unto us in the holy Sacrament,
that ^read which is his body, that wine which is his ^loud. A donation real ^s
made to us of Christ, and of all that which he has conquered unto us, that
which generally is proposed in the word, particularly is applied in the
Sacrament to every true, penitent, and believing receiver: for it is not a
naked sign or symboll which there is put into our hands, but an effectual
exhibiting instrument of Christ Jesus, and of all that by his death he has
merited unto us.

Last of all, we have possession 4 Possession.
of it, not only as we said has he carried our nature into the heavens, and
possessed it there, but he has delivered to us the keys of the Kingdom,
Faith and Prayer, by the which, when we knock, he opens, and gives us even
in this life, an entrance to it, that we may after a sort view and behold the
glory thereof, as Moses from the top of Pisgah viewed Canaan: and this is a
present pledge of that future redemption of the possession abiding us
hereafter, when we shall more fully enjoy it then ^ow we can.

Thus have we seen in And yet no man has this assurance at all times in a
like measure.
a part what sure and undoubted warrants, Saints called and justified, have of
their salvation; yet it is to be observed, that this assurance continues not
with them always in a like measure: they are many a time exercised with
doubtings, and desertions, for their greater humiliation: but this is sure,
true Religion approues no doubting, far less prescribes it, but rather
improues it, and by strong arguments taken out of the word, strengthens Faith,
and remoueth all causes of dubitation furnished by infidelity. But that I may
eschew repetition, he that lists may read this matter entreated at greater
length on the eight to the Romans, where we have also proved that Saints
called once by grace, and justified by Faith, are sure of final perseverance.

Verse 3. And though I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and
receive you unto my self, that where I am, there ye may be also.
Follows now 3 The third degree of comfort against death is the consideration

the third degree of the Comfort. The ^isciples yet might have said; Lord, it
is a great ^omfort to hear of the ^any Mansions which ^re in thy Fathers
house, greater yet to hear that ^hou wilt go and prepare them for us; but
this this is still the matter o^ our fear, we are clothe^ with mortal and
corruptible bodies, which shortly must be turned into dust and ashes, and with

me. For this cause when the Apostle had prayed for the Ephesians, that God
would open their eyes Ephesians. 1. 18. 19.
and let them see the riches of that glorious inheritance prepared for the
Saints, he subioynes incontinently another prayer, that God would open their
eyes to see that exceeding greatness of his power toward us that believe. These
two are requisite for our complete comfort: first, to know the greatness of
that promised glory: next, to know that the great power of God will bring us
unto it, He will perform his promised kingdom.

peremptorily will he keep the time of his second coming. Indeed it is hid from
us, and men when out of their own conjectures they determine of it, expose
Christian religion to the ludibry of the unbelieving.

Always as the Fathers As the Fathers under the law longed for Christ's first
coming, so should we for the second. 1 Cor. 1. 7.
and Saints under the old Testament longed for his first coming, Abraham,
Jacob, Simeon, and the rest, so should we for the second; Wait for the

them. Such scorners mocked A warning for ^corners.

though the day of Let it be as long to the day of the general doom as they

their general doom be delayed, yet the day of their particular doom comes
upon them sooner then they looked for, which cutteth down their bodies with
strange and unexpected judgments, and draws their souls to vnder-lye a wrath
whereof they never dreamed. Alas, that miserable and foolish man cannot think
upon this. I suppose (says Augustine, thou were able to prolong the day of
judgment, or that it should be delayed as long ^s thou think thou would
have it delayed, Quantum vis diem iudicij Aug. de temp. ser 96

known and manifest manner, that he may judge: If at the first he had
manifested himself, who durst have judged him? For as the Apostle says, If
they had known, they would not have crucified the God of glory. If other

not themselves with any of another kind, but if any man gather them, of their
own accord they run together into one, says Nyssenus. Yea, if a skillful
Gardner having sundry sorts of seeds confounded, and mixed through others in
his hand, can discern one from another, and reduce and gather every one of
them to their own kinds, why shall we think it impossible for the Lord, who
has the whole earth in Pugillo, in his fist, to discern the bodies of his
Saints one of them from another, and from all other creatures whatsoever.

And to this same purpose By Augustine.
says Augustine: Is it not more admirable to see heavenly Spirits bound and
detayned in earthly bodies, (which we know by experience) then that earthly
bodies should be raised up into heavenly places? And again disputing against
the Platoniques, who from the natural weight of the Elements, reasoned, that
no earthly body could be in heaven, he says; Aug. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 22.
cap. 4. and cap. 11.
Quid ergo faciunt terrena ^ot corpora in aere, nisi for^e qui per plumarum,
and ^ennarum leuitatem, dona^it auium terrenis corporibus, vt portentur in
aere, immortalibus factis corporibus hominum non poterit He who gives wings to
earthly bodies to fly in the air, can he not give power to his Saints to
mount up unto heaven?
donare virtutem, qua etiam in summo coelo va^eant habitare? What then do so
many earthly bodies in the air, unless ye will say, that he who by wings and
feathers, gives unto Birds this power to be carried into the Air, cannot give
to the body of man made immortal, that virtue, whereby it may dwell even in
the highest heavens? And again says he; Seeing man by his And seeing man
makes heavy things to float in the water, cannot our God carry up heavy bodies
to heavenly places?
artifice can make heavy earthly bodies swim above in the waters, why
contradict we the word of the Lord our God, promising to us that our heavy and
earthly bodies shall be carried up into heaven, and this mortal shall put on
immortality, and this corruptible shall put on incorruptibilitie? yea, our
bodies shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ, that is, as Theodoret
Theodor. dial. 2. cap. 23.
observes, (...), in respect of quality, not of quantity: for in respect of
quantity our Lord shall exceed us as far as the light of the Sun exceedes
the light of the Stars. This then is our comfort against the present
contemptible state of our bodies: corruption now has seized upon them, the
grave for a time gets them in her possession: our enemies do what they can to
undo them; for what else mean they, when not content to burn the bodies of
the Saints, they disperse the dust thereof into the waters? But in despite of
them all our Lord shall gather them again, and fulfill this promise, I will
come again and receive you.

But shall we not be received before the second This promise of receiving us
to himself is to be understood of our bodies.
coming of our Lord? Doubtless the soul immediately after the dissolution of
it from the body is carried the straight way into heaven; I desire to be
dissolved that I may be with Christ: being with Christ follows dissolution.
This night thou shall be with me in Paradise: So the soul of Lazarus without
delay was carried into Abraham's bosom: but our Savior means here of our full
redemption, of our last adoption, whereby our bodies shall also be raised to
enjoy their promises: and this the Apostle calls The redemption of the body.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, Virtuous, and Godly Lady, Dame Elizabeth Kar, Lady
Broughtoun.
MADAME:
Having near at one time, brought out these two Treatises, like ^wo twins:
the one intrea^ing of Heavenly Mansi^ns, the other of Patience. The eldest of
these two, I have committed to the patrocinie of the right Noble Lady, the
Countess of Mar, the second for many reasons, do I dedicate to your L. Grace
has joined your hearts together in one holy band of mutual love in the truth,
which I trust these Treatises may serve some way to confirm, no way to
dissolve: for they contend not one with another, as did the two twins Jacob
and Esau, in the womb of Rebecca, but rather cherish one another; yea, without
the one the other cannot consist.

The Heavenly Mansions cannot be obtained without Patience: neither can
Patience be preserved without looking to the Heavenly Mansions. The practicing
^f Patience now, leads us ^o the full possession of the heavenly Mansions
here^fter. In these I am sure ^and your greatest comfort, without which all
comforts ^f the world are but deceit^ll vanities.

It is true, Nature has ^ought you out Honorable (...) concerning this life,
the ^ister germane of a right ^oble Lord, The Lord ^oxbrugh, the Spouse of
(...) Honorable Knight, Sir James Bellenden: but All the glory of flesh is as
the flower of the field; Only the word of the Lord endures for ever. And
herein is your greatest glory, that by the immortal seed^ of the Word, ye are
made the daughter of the living Lord begotten again to an inheritance
immortal, undefiled, and that fadet^ not away. This is one po^ which greatly
magnifies the prerogative of Grace about all the privileges of nature that the
one euanisheth, the other endures. All conjunction on earth shall suffer
dissolution, except only the conjunction of a soul with God in Christ. And
this even in your young years has God taught you by sour experience. It is
now about ten years since death divorced ^ou from your natural hus^and: yet
in this time did ^ot the Lord forsake you: through his grace ye have ^eene an

Temple, a diligent hearer of his word, to the good example of others who wait
for the redemption of Israel. Which (with many more) as hitherto they have
been evident in you, to your great commendation before the world, so I pray
God these, and all other graces of his Spirit, requisite to your eternal
salvation, may be multiplied upon you for your approbation before the Lord. To
whose mercy both now and ever I commend you And rests

THE PRAISE of Patience.
My help is in the Name of the Lord.
LVKE 21. 19. By your Patience possess your souls.
THis Exhortation Two parts of this precept.
short in words, but rich in matter, renders to us a twofold instruction:
first, it lets us see what is it in all our 1 Possess your souls
spiritual warfare the adversary pursues, and the Christian has to defend,
to wit, the Soul: next, the armor recommended to us whereby we may best
defend the soul, namely, Patience.

The Soul is the most The soul is the most excellent part of man.
excellent part of man; under it, says Augustine, is comprehended the whole
inward man, whereby August. de Eccles. dogmat. cap. 34.
this mass of clay is quickened, governed, and kept together, changing her
names according to her sundry offices and operations in the body: when she
quickneth the body, It has sundry names according to her sundry offices.
she is called the Soul, Anima; when she has appetite or desire to any
thing, she is called the Will, Animus; for knowledge she is called the Mind;
for recordation, the Memory; for judging and discerning, she is called Reason.
The soul was not made of the Elements as other creatures are, that it being
free from composition, might also be free from corruption, whereunto other
creatures are subject. God breathed into man a living soul, said Moses,
thereby declaring, that he created a spiritual immortal soul, which he
breathed into the body to quicken it.

That the estate of the That the estate of the soul depends not on the estate
of the body is cleared.
soul depends not on the body, experience proves* for in weak and withered
bodies the soul is more quick and pregnant oftentimes then in stronger* And
that it is also of another nature is evident; for where the body by small
things is easily surcharged, and so filled that it can contain no more; such
is the superexcellencie of the soul, that no mortal thing can contain it. It
ravished Nyssenus with admiration, when he considered, Quae sit Nyssen. de
opifici^. hom. cap. 10.
interioris nostrae capacitatis amplitudo, in quam omnia per auditum infusa
influunt, and in qua visu recepta rerum apparentium simulachra, formis certis
depinguntur? What is the amplitude of our inward capacity, into the which all
things infused by the ear flows, and wherein the images of all things seen
by the eye, are contained and pictured in their own forms?

But by the contrary, the good estate and welfare But by the contrary, the
good estate of the body depe^ds on the good estate of the soul.
of the body depends upon the good estate of the soul: keep it, and keep
all; lose it, and lose all: Nobilem hospitem habes, o Caro, and tota salus tua
dependet de eius salute: O Flesh, a noble Guest have thou within thee, and all
thy good estate depends upon his good estate: think not shame to dishonor thy
self, that thou may honor him; nor to disease thy self, that thou may
ease him. Neglect him not because he is a stranger, but consider diligently,
Quid hospitis huius B^rn.
praesentia tibi largiatur: what great benefits thou enioyest by his presence,
and what loss thou shall sustain by his absence: when he goes from thee
thine eye will see no more then the clay, thine ear will hear no more then
the stone, thy body shall lose all the beauty it has now; yea, no member
thereof shall do the own office. Et si tantum tibi confert exul, and in terra
peregrina, quantu^ tibi praestabit in patria? And if thou have so great
benefits by it in a strange land, what shall it do to thee when it gets thee
in her own Country.

Yet such is the beastly The beastly ignorance of many, who knowing all things,
which they know by the soul, yet scarce know that they have a soul.
ignorance of man, that albeit he feels the life he has by the soul, and
finds by daily experience, that the body loses life when the soul leaves
it, yet has he no care of the soul, and does not so much as remember it once
in the day. And therefore our Savior who knows our soars better then our
selves do, recommends to us this care, Possess your souls; and he teaches
^ow we may do it, by ^our patience. God is the God of Patience, keep
^atience and thou shall ^eepe the Lord; and in ^eeping him shall keep ^hine
own soul. God ^wels not in perturbati^ns, he comes to his ^aints as he came
to E^, 1 Kings 19. 11. 12.
not in the mighty ^ind that rent the moun^aines, nor in the Earth^uake, nor in
the fire, but ^ee came to him in a soft and still voice: he dwel^eth Esaias 65. 2.
with the poor, and ^im that is of a contrite spirit. As the soul is the ^ife
of the body, ita anima Bern. de vita animae.

life of the soul: Mors (...) mae fit cum eam deserit Deus, sicut corporis cum
id de serit anima; ergo vtriusque id est, totius hominis more est, cum anima a
Deo deserta, deserit corpus: ita eni^ nec ex Deo viuit ipsa, ne^ corpus ex
ipsa: The death of the soul is, when God leaves the soul, like a^ the death
of the body is when the soul leaves it, so the death of both, that is, of the
whole man is* when the soul left o^ God leaves the body* for o^ neither has
the soul life from God, nor the body life from the soul.

In all the battles then In all tentations Satan pursues nothing but our soul.
which Satan by himself or his instruments makes against us, the quarrel
and question is de anima, about the Soul: It is the soul he pursues, it is
the soul we have to defend: if he cross thee in thy goods, in thy body, in
thy name, he cares not for these, none of these are a morsel for his mouth,
Animam tuam quaerit, it is thy soul he seeks, to make it by impatience
partaker of his own condemnation. A clear example of this we have in Job:
Satan by Gods permission If he trouble us in body or goods, it is to get a
vantage of the soul. Job 1. and 2.
crossed him in his goods by Sabeans, Caldeans, and by a fire from heaven: he
crossed him in his children, whom he smothered by the overthrow of the house
wherein they were banqueting: he crossed him in his body with sore boyles, Et
cum aperto certamine Greg. lib 3. in Job.
superari se vidit, de ore coniugis iaculu^ quasi de insidijs intor sit: And
when This is cleared by Jobs example.
he perceived himself in open combat to be overcome, he secretly threw a
dart at him out of the mouth of his wife, as it were by boutgates to overthrow
him. What he sought by all this, he declares it himself, to wit, that Job
might blaspheme the Lord to his face: and the same is it, whereat he aims in
all our outward or inward tentations, that he may carry away and captive our
souls by impatience, that he may drive us to grudging, murmuring and
blaspheming of the Lord our The remembrance of this should work strength
aginst tentation.
God. I am persuaded if our memories were sanctified to remember this, we
would not suffer our selves to be so easily perturbed, commoued and transported
with passions for light offenses cast in our way, as commonly* we are: let us
therefore in all our tentations remember this watchword of our Savior,
Possess your souls in patience, what ever loss we sustain of any thing
that is ours, take heed we loose not our selves, but let us do as Joseph
did, when the wife of Putiphar caught hold of his garment, that she might snare
himself, he let the garment go and saved himself. Such things as God gives
power to man to take from ^hee, let them go: and possess thou thy soul in
patience.

But the manner of A question: how can we possess the soul seeing by the
soul we possess all that we possess?
speech is here to be mar^ed, seeing by the soul ^ee possess any thing that
we possess, for by (...), we think, we affect, ^ee work; what is this,
^hereby we can possess ^ur souls? For answer, ^e must know that in the
^oule of a Christian man ^here are two contrary ^arties, one regenerate,
another unregenerate: light, ^race, and sanctification in the one: darkness,
corrupt nature, and sin in the other; whereby let no man think that the
soul is divided or parted into The answer of this question.
two halfs; for it is a simple and indivisible essence. But as we see the
twilight of the morning, it is neither full darkness, as at midnight, nor full
light, as in the noone-tide of the day, yet is it one and the same light,
though it increase by degrees clearer and clearer till the noone, then it was
in the morning: So is it with the soul of a Christian, it is not altogether
darkness as the soul of the wicked and reprobate is, whose night is not
past; yea, the darkness of their midnight will never pass, but still it waxes
darker and darker till they come to utter darkness. Neither How in the soul
of a regenerate man there are two contrary parties.
yet is it altogether ^ight, as the souls triumphant are, who rest and feed
with him whom their soul loves, in the ^oone-tide of the day; but it is
throughout all partly regenerate, partly ^nregenerate. No faculty of the soul
is without the remanents of ignorance and sinful corruption, nor yet without
beginnings of knowledge and renouation by grace. And these are the two which S.
Paul calls, The new man and the old: sinful corruption is called the old man,
because it was in v^ before renewing grace (...) and again, because i^ waxes
weaker and weaker, till grace utterly a^ the length abolish it. Thi^ Of this
the meaning of the precept is made plain.
then being the estate o^ our soul, the meaning o^ the exhortation is, tha^ we
should fortify the (...) part, ever endeuourin^ that light may banis^
darkness, Grace in the ^oule may subdue sinful ^orruption, and the new ^an
may overcome the ^ld man, till at length that usurper Satan be ^ully
dispossessed, and we possess our souls as a quiet habitation for the God of
peace and of pa^ience to dwell in.

Again, seeing the Apostle God is the immediate superior and possessor of our
souls and bodies. 1 Cor. 6. 19 20.
speaking to Chri^tians says, Ye are not your ^wne, ye are bought with (...)
price; therefore glorify God in your body and in ^our spirit, for they are
Gods: how are we commanded to possess our souls, seeing they are not our
own? The answer is easy: our immediate superior and proper possessor of our
souls and bodies is the Lord: we hold them of him, as tenants at his will,
not for our selves but for the Lord. As he is a traitor Seeing we hold them of
him, it were treason to render them to his enemy.
who renders the Palace or castle of a Prince which he has received in
keeping, to the enemy of the Prince: so is he who casts open the ports of his
soul to every unclean spirit, and gives the members Romans 6. 13.
of his body as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin. Thus then we are but
vnder-possessors of our souls and bodies: as we hold them of the Lord, so
should we hold them for the Lord. Far be this rebellion from us, to hold the
Lords own house against himself.

Besides this, Augustines He is possessed, and not a possessor, who possesses
not himself.
^bseruation here is wor^hy to be remembered. Our Savior says not, ^ossidete
villas vestras, sed ^ossidete animas vestras: Possess your villages, or Aug.
de temp. ser. 223.
^uch like, but possess your souls. The men of this world glory in their
external possessions, but ^s Cyprian said of them: Non intelligunt miseri
possederi Cyp. lib. 2. epist. 2.
se, potius, quam possidere: These miserable men understand not that they are
rather possessed by their riches, then possessors of them. Only the Only the
Christian is to be esteemed a rich man.
Christian is a man of great possessions, and he holds them all by these three
graces, Faith, Love, and Patience: by Faith he possesses the Lord, and all
his benefits: by Love he possesses his neighbor, and all the good that is in
him; he rejoices in it, as in hi^ own: by Patience again^ he possesses
himself And without these, though thou were as rich as Craesus, thou art but
poor: for what can thou be said to possess, who art neither a possessor of
thy self, nor of thy neighbor, nor of the Lord thy God?

This is a necessary doctrine How needful this doctrine is for this age.
for this age, where^n men are out of measure careful; yea, conten^ious for
the smallest thing which is theirs, but ^ltogether careless for ^hemselues:
they are ready to resist him that would wound their bo^ies, and resolute to
fight for the least thing which is theirs, only when the oppressor of the
soul inuades it, no contradiction is made to him. Oh that they were wise to
ponder that warning of Moses and S. Paul, Attend tibi, take Which cares for
a^y that is theirs, but not for themselves.
heed to thy self! art not thou thy self much more worth then anything that
is thine? If thou be so careful for that which thou accountest to be thine,
how is it that thou forgettest thy self? Et si August. de temp. ser. 223.

ipsa? An^ seeing the soul endures such labor that it may possess perishing
things, what should it endure, that it perish not it self? O sons of men,

fool, that their souls are full when their bodies are full: Now my soul thou

Beside that, we are the The example of Christ teaches us patience.
Soldiers of that Captain who obtained the greatest victory that ever was
conquered, by patient suffering. The Samaritanes held him at the port, the
Disciples inflamed with ire called for fire from heaven, but patient Jesus
reproved them; Ye know not of what spirit ye are. The Pharisees reviled him,
and said he had a Devil, but our Lord reviled them not again. Judas came to
betray him, and our Savior went out and embraced him: O wonderful Patience!
Quod dolosis proditoris labijs August. de temp. ser. 223.
non negauit osculum pacis: that to the deceitful lips of the false traitor,
he denied not the kiss of his mouth. The men of war buffetted him, scourged
him, mocked him, but he like the Lamb, was dumb before the shearer: so he
who by his word requires Patience, by his example teaches us Patience, as that
singular grace whereby we are able to get most glorious victory, yea, to become
more then Conquerours through him that loved us.

His Saints in like manner True Christians after Christ's example have advanced
his kingdom by Patience.
following the example of their Lord, have advanced his Kingdom more by the
patient suffering of the shedding of their own blood, then ever any Monarch of
the world could advance ^is Kingdom by the shedding of the blood of others:

out most abundant increase, being watered with the blood of the Apostles and
other Martyrs? Quo plus sanguinis Cyprian de dupl^nart.

did that blessed Vine-tree, springing from the root Christ Jesus, spread out
her branches. For this cause said Tertullian, that Sanguis Martyrum Tertull.

the Adversary is forced to confess, that albeit in the Primitive Church there
were as many thousand Christians as were able to have given battle to the
persecuting Emperors, yet they had rat^er overcome by patient suffering, then

Persecuters, but not to the patient sufferers of the Church Primitive: Non enim
conuenit Erasm. enchirid. militis Christ. Epist. ad Volsium.
vt hoc argumento nos Christianos declaremus, si quam plurimos occiderimus, sed
si quam plurimos seruauerimus: For it is not an argument to prove our selves to
be good Christians, if we slay many, but rather if we save many. If we be
otherwise minded, Fieri potest, vt citius in Turcas degeneremus, quam Turcas in
partet nostras pertrahamus: It may come to pass that we degenerate into
Turks, then draw Turks to be of our Religion: For by the shedding of blood,
Fiet vt latius fortasse regnet Pontifex aut huius Cardinales, non vt latius
regnet Christus: It may be The Popes Kingdom and his Cardinals may be advanced
by blood shedding, not so Christ's.
perhaps that the Popes Kingdom, and of his Cardinals, may be increased, but
the Kingdom of Christ by such means cannot be advanced: but leaving them, we
return to our selves. Our Savior here forewarneth his Disciples of great
troubles they were to sustain for his names sake, the armor he recommends
unto us, is not the Sword; the Pope may use it, because Peter did it without a
warrant, but the watchword given by our Lord unto us all is, Possess your
Soul by your Patience: This is the weapon whereby I ouer-came, and this same
do I recommend to you.

As the Thunder (says Patience compared to the Laurel tree, which cannot be
Thunderslaine.
Pliny) overthrows any tree but the Laurel, so persecution and tentation
ouercomes any man, but not a patient man. Impatience makes a man a prey to
every one that pursues him, but he who has Patience is invincible. Every
injury offered to a patient man, returns back to him that did it: Eodem
exitu, Tertull. de Patientia.
quo telum aliquod in pe^ram constantissimae duritiae libratum and obtusum: No

shot it. Impatientia exhedra est omnium delictorum: Impatience is the
receptacle and right lodging place of all sins: Malum enim est impatientia
boni: For evil is but the impatience of good: who would commit adultrie if he
were patient of Chastity? Patientia Ibid.
vero Charitatis est firmamentum: Ira, Discordia, Simultas, locum in pectore
non habent, in quo dominatur Charitas: But Patience is the sure keeper and
stablishment of Charity: Anger, Discord, Hatred, have no place in that heart,
in the which Charity ouerrules: Though all the world were against such a man,
he rests quiet in his own mind, and possesses his soul in Patience.

might bind him, no not with chains, because that when he was often bound
with fetters and chains, he plucked the chains a sunder, and brake the
fetters in pieces, neither could any man tame him. Both night and day he cried
in the mountains and in the graves, and struck himself with stones. But here
is the great inconsideration of men: A man this way bodily possessed, is pityed
of all that behold him: but though he be spiritually possessed, and oppressed
by the enemies of his soul, to raging, railing, blaspheming, whoring, and all
sort of impiety, who does regard it? Always, to return great is the praise
of Patience, that it makes a man possesser and master of himself.

The reason of this is, Patience is never alone without the rest of the Graces.
because Patience is never alone, all the remanent Graces of the Spirit
frequent the Palace of Patience, there are they preserved, and entertained. As
vices are linked together, so are Virtues: they march in battle against the
spiritual enemy, in comely The order how Graces march in the spiritual
warfare.

of the Word, to show them the way wherein they should walk against the Prince
of darkness: At the one hand of Truth stands Foresight, as in a Watchtower,
ever looking out to discover the approaching of the enemy: at the other hand
stands Fear, with this watchword in her Banner, Walk circumspectly. In the
second rank after Truth follows Faith foot for foot; 2 Faith, with Love and
Holiness.
for Faith follows No de^eiuable Fables: and Faith has in the right hand the
Sword of the Spirit, and in the left, A Buckler able to quench the fiery darts
of the Devil. Upon the right hand of Faith stands Charity or Love; for,
Faith works by Love, and Love carries in her Banner The complement of the
Law: on the other hand stands Holiness; for The Heart is purified by Faith;
and Holiness bea^eth in her Banner The Image of God. In the third rank, at
the back of Holiness stands Humility, 3 Th^se are attended by Humility an^

having in her badge the similitude of a man mortified and dead with Christ.
Beside Humility, at the back of Love, stands her sister Meekness, bearing
in her badge the similitude of a Lamb. In the fourth rank stands Patience,

manifold former deliverances: Experience has upon the one hand Hope, whose
badge is a brazen Pillar: and on the other hand Fortitude, in the similitude of
an armed man, having on his head the Helmet of salvation, and on his body the
Breast Plate of righteousness, When Patience is sore put at, and somewhat moved
out of her place by vehement trouble, she leanes back upon the pillar of
Hope, and Hope succors her with this Dictum, Spera meliora: From Hope she
looks over, and reads the Book of Experience, whose first Dictum is,

high with both her hands, with this Dictum, He that perseueres to the end shall
be saved. Through all these flies Prayer like a winged Cherub. Round about all
these flies Prayer.
When Truth is sore impugned, and Faith begins to faint, Love languisheth:
when Patience is sore put at, and Hope begins to houer, or any other of the
remanent Graces waxes weak, then Prayer goes up, as a speedy messenger, to the
great Captain of the Lords Army, Jesus Christ, and procures for help to be
sent from him, which without failing comes always in the time of need. And this
is the way whereby the Saints of GOD possess their Souls in Patience.

Of this it is evident, No true Patience can be, where Truth, Love, and Faith,
etc. are not.
that no true Patience can be, where Truth, Faith, Love, and the rest of these
Graces are not: and therefore the greatest sufferings of Ethnikes, Heretics,
and others void of Faith, Truth, and Love, are justly excluded from the praise
of Patience: Ethnici multa tulerunt animo forti, nulla tamen cum solida
consolatione: Ethnikes have suffered many things with a strong, or rather an
obstinate heart, but without any solid consolation. Curtius a Roman Aug. de
ciuit. Dei, lib. 5. cap. 18.
Knight armed and upon horseback, precipitated himself and his Horse
headlong into a gulf of the earth, for a good, which in his ignorance he
supposed might thereby come to the City of Rome: this was fury, not Fortitude.
And many other natural men, out of the like madness, to show their
magnanimity and stoutnesse of mind, Patience of Ethnikes is not worthy to be
called Patience.
have not only endured horrible pains inflicted by others upon them, but have
made an end of themselves by poison, by fire, and many sorts of cruel death:
this is not to possess their soul in Patience: this is not says Augustine,

but pusillanimitie the Daughter of Impatience, which because it cannot endure,
it seeks to eschew that which grieves it. Soli Christiani Cyprian de Patientia.
sicut veram Sapientiam, ita and veram habent Patientiam: Only the Christian
as he has true Wisdom, so has he true Patience. And of all other
Patience, beside Christian Patience, that is true which S. James speaks of all
other wisdom: Aug. de temp. ser. 223.
Non est ista Patientia desur sum descendens, sed terrena, animalis, diabolica:
cur enim non sit superborum falsa Patientia, sicut superborum falsa Sapientia?
This Patience comes not from above, but is earthly, sensual, and Devilish:
seeing proud men have their own false sapience, what marvel they have also
their own false and deceitful Patience.

And of this same nature Sufferings of Heretics in like manner are not to be
esteemed Patience.
is the Patience of Heretics: they may make a show of voluntary Religion in
not sparing the body, but seeing they have not the truth of GOD, how can they
have true Patience? The Baalites of Idolatrous Israel launcing themselves with
knives: the Gymnosophists of India, who pine and distress their bodies with
labor not required at their hands: the Poenitentiaries of Rome (so much
boasted of) who scourge themselves, and spare not their own flesh: the four
religious Orders of superstitious men among the Turks, who in hard using of
their bodies go beyond these I have spoken of: yet are they all strangers from
this Praise of Patience. Cum ergo vider is Aug. ibid.

therefore thou see any man suffer any thing patiently, praise not thou
incontinent his Patience, for patient suffering cannot be commended, unless
the cause of the suffering be known: if the cause be good, then the Patience is
good also.

pernicious branch of the Heresy of the Donatists, were so desirous to obtain
by suffering, the praise of Martyrdom, that they would throw themselves down
headlong from high places, or cast themselves into fire or water: But Augustine
in his learned Disputes, Aug. de temp. sermon. 223.
pulls from them the Praise of Patience: Quid miseri faciunt, qui cum non
solum impietatis aduersus Deum, sed etiam ipsius, quam in se exercuerunt
crudelitatis, luant poenas, insuper and quaerunt Martyrum glorias? What do
these miserable men, who when they suffer punishment of their impiety toward
GOD, and cruelty toward themselves, yet out of such suffering seek the glory
of Martyrdom? An impatiens passio coronabitur? Shall an impatient passion be
crowned? Aut quomodo innocens iudicabitur cui dictum est, diliges proximum
sicut teipsum, si homicidium committit in seipso, quod committere prohibetur in
altero? Or how shall he be judged innocent, who is commanded to love his
neighbor as himself, if he commit murder in himself, which he is
forbidden to commit in another? Si enim parricida The worst sort of homicide is
selfe-murther.

etiam propinquum necat, and quo propinquiorem quisque necat, tanto immanior
iudicatur: sine dubio peior est, qui se occiderit, quia nemo est homini seipso
propinquior: For, if a parricide be so much the more wicked then another
homicide, because he not only slayes a man, but a kinsman, and the nearer the
man be to him whom he slayes, the more beastly is he that slew him esteemed
to be of all men: then out of doubt much worse is he that slayes himself,
seeing there is none nearer to a man, then a man himself.

But how is this that In what sense Patience is said to be ours.
our Savior calls Patience ours: for so says he, By your Patience possess
your souls? Patience is ours, even as the Soul is ours, to wit, by the gift
of God, we have it not of our selves; He is the Father of lights, from whom
descends every good gift. The Pelagians of old attributed this grace to the
power of man's free will: the Papists of our time affirm the same. But as
Augustine said to the Aug. d^ temp. sermon. 223.

But because we have Patience a singular preservative to keep the heart in
peace.
at length spoken of Patience, in our Anatomy of a Christian, we contract our
selves, and shortly conclude this* Our Savior having forewarned his Disciples
of manifold troubles abiding them, arms them against all with this one,
Possess your souls in Patience. Here is a Preservative able to keep peace in
thy heart, and to banish all perturbation. And it serves for all tentations,

his Testimonies: his work can never come against his word. The way wherein he
walks may seem rough and unpleasant to thee for a time, but wait thou for
the end, and thou shall see it comfortable. This moved Job to resolve, Though
the Lord would slay me, yet will I trust in him: and by it David also did
strengthen himself in great extremity of trouble, Why art thou cast down my
Soul? Psalm. 43. 5.
and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait upon GOD: I will yet give him
thanks. In the beginning of the thirteenth Psalm, how greatly David was
troubled ye may perceive by his own words, How long, Psa. 13. 1. 5.
will thou forget me Lord, for ever? How long will thou hide thy face from
me? But how comfortable an end his trouble had ye may see by the last Verse:
But I trust in thy mercy: my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing
to the Lord, because he has dealt lovingly with me. And if thy trouble come
