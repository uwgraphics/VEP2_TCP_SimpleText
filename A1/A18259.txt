A Caveat or Warning. For all sorts of Men both young and old, to avoid the
Company of lewd and wicked Women.
To the tune of Virginia.


I Once did love a b^nn^e Less,
As Oxford Town does know,
But now I see all is not gold,
that makes a glistring show.
The fairest apple to the eye.
May have a rotten core:
And young men all now by my my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
She Will stroke your cheeks she will stroke your chin,
She Will fling her arms abou' you,
And sh'eele protest with vows and oaths,
She cannot live withou' you:
She Will sigh and sob if that you say,
You Will come to her no more:
And Gallants all by this my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
She Will buy you bandstrings at the Fair,
She Will cause you for to woe her:
She Will make you bracelets of her hair.
for to bewitch you to her,
She Will sit upon you all the night,
She Will give you kisses store:
But Gallants all by this my fall,
take heed, trust not a whore.
If thou should be in heaven (quo'h she)
I would not live in hell:


If thou should be on earth quoth she,
in heaven I would not dwell:
If thou should be on sea (quoth she)
I would not be on shore:
Then Gallants all now by my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
If that you chance for to be sad,
She Will bid you send for wine:
For that is good sweet heart quoth she,
for thy choice heart and mine:
And thus with swee' and smiling words,
She Will diue into your store:
But Gallants all now by my fall,
take heedd trust not a whore.
When she has had her whole desire,
And all your quoyne is spent,
If you entreat her company,
she will say she' shall be shente
Then will she leave you to your self,
Your fortones to deplore:
Then Gallants all now by my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
The Second Part. To the same tune.


She Will sit alone with you and swear,
By God that did her make,
While breath within her body is,
she will not you forsake:
She Will let you toy, and stroke and kiss,
She Will let you do much more:
But youngmen all, now by my fall,
take heed trust not a Whore.
Now here I lie, my friends do fly,
My wench does quite forswear me,
Her fathers house is but hard by,
and yet she comes not near me me:
In prison I for her do lie,
Close by her fathers door:
And young men all now by my fall,
take heed trust not a whore:
My Creditors they chafe at me,
For my time spent so bad,
And scarce I see no friend I have,
is for my grief now sad:
And those that loud in sormer times,
They now do me abhore:
Then youngmen all now by my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
My kinsfolks they do send to me,
And often me do rail,
Now am I plagud in misery,
Here lying in the Iayle:


But if that I come out again,
Though I be nere so poor:
I never more will give consent,
to meddle with a whore.
You young men that in London live,
Take heed by this my fall:
For if you still will follow whores,
they will deuore you all:
Your quoine, your states, your health and friends.
Then turn you oat of door:
O Youngmen all by this my fall,
take heed trust not a whore.
Now farewell all you Prentises,
That do in London dwell,
Leave all those vices, which will bring
one day your souls to hell:
So with my heart prayer for you,
I now will say no more:
But wish you all both great and small,
take heed love not a whore.
FINIS.
Imprinted at London for H. G.
