Thomas Arundell / Archbishop of Ca^turbury / the year of ower Lord. M.CCCC.
and seven.

The examinacion of the honorable knight sye Ihon^ Oldcastell Lord Cobham /
burnt by the said Archebisshop / in the first year of King Henry the fyfth.

Benomore ashamed to hear it / then ye were and be / to do it.

Unto the Christen Reader.
GRace and peace in our lord Jesus Christ. Read here with judgment good
reader the examinacion of the blssed man of god / and there thou shall caselye
perceive wherefore our holy chirch a^ the most on holy sort of all the people
will be called) make all their examinacio^s in darkness / all the lay people
clean excluded from their councels. For if their lies had been openly confuted
and also that the accused of heresye might as well have been admytted to reason
their articles with council / whether they were heresye or no as the accused
of treason agenst the king / is admytted to his council to confute his cause
and articles whether they be treason or not / they should never have murdered
nor prisoned so many good christen men as they have done. For their cloked lies
could never have continued so long in the light / as they have done in
corners. They good men when they / come in the pulpet and preach agenst the
treuth / cry: If their learning were good and true / they would never go in
corners / but speak it openly. Where unto I answer that beside that Christ
and his apostles were compelled (for because of the furyousnes of their fathers
the bishops and preastes) which only that time also would be called holy
church) often times for to walk secretly / and absent them self and give
place to their malice? yet we have daily examples off more then one or two /
that have not spared nor feared for to speak and also preach opnlye the
truth which have been taken of them prysoned and brent / beside other that
for fear of death have abiured and carried fagottes. Of whose articles and
examinacion there is no leye man that can show a word. Who can tell wherefore
(not many years paste) there were seven burnt in conuentrye on one day? Who
can tell wherefore that good preaste and holy martyr Sir Thomas hitton was
burnt / now this year / at maydstone in Kent? I am sure no man. For this is
their cast ever when they have put to death or punyshed any man / after their
secret examynacyon / to slander him of soche things as he never thought. As
they may do well Enough: seeing there is no man to contrary them. Wherefore I
exhort the good brother / who soever thou be that redest this treatise / mark
hit well and consider it seryouslye / and there thou shall find not only
what the church is / their doctrine of the Sacrament / the worshyppynge off
ymagyes / pylgremage / confession / Swerynge and payinge of tithes? But also
thou may se what strong and substancyall arguments off scripture and
doctoures / and what clerkely reasons / my lord / the hedde and prymate of the
holy church in England (as he will be taken) brings agenst this pore / folysh
/ simple / and mad losell / knave / and heretic as he calls him. And also
the very cause wherefore all their examynacions are made in darkness. And the
lord of all light shall lighten the with the candle of his grace / for to se
the truth. Amen.

This I have corrected and put forth in the english that now is used in
England / for owe^ sothern men / nothing thereto adding ne yet there from
mynysshyng. And I entende hereafter with the help of God to put it forth in
his own old english / which shall well serve / I doubt not / both for the
northern men and the faithful brothern of scotla^de.

THe Lord god that knows all things worteth well that I am right sorrowful
for to write or to make known this sentence beneth written where that of mine
even christian set in hie state and dignite so great blyndnes and malice may
be known that they that presume of them self to distroye vices and to plant
in men virtues / another dread to offe^de god nor lust to please him as their
warkes show. For certes the biddinge of god and his law / which in the
praysynge of his most holy name / he commands to be known and kept of all
men and women / young and old* after the co^nynge and power yt he has given
to them / the prelates of this land and their mynisters / with the comente of
prestys chefely consentyng to them / enforce them most besyly to withstonde
and destroy the holy ordinance of god. And there through / god is greatly
wroth and moeuyd to take hard vengeance not only upon them that do the
evyll / but also on the^ all that consent to these Antichristys lymnes: Which
know or might know their malice and their falshode / and dress them not to
withstond their malice and their great pride. Nevertheless four things
moves me to writes is sentence beneth. The first thing that moeueth me
hereto is this / that where as it was known to certain friends yt I came from
the preson of Shrewisbury: and as it befell in deed that I should to the preson
of Canterbury: than diverse friends in diverse places spoke to me full
hartefully and full tenderly: and commanded me the^ if it so were that I
should be examined before ye Archebishope of Canterbury / that if I mygh^e in
any wise / I should writ mine apposinge and mine answeringe. And I promised
to my special friends / that if I might / I would gladly do their biddinges as
I might. The.ij. thing that moves me to write this sentence is this / diverse
friends which have herd that I have been examined before ye Archebisshop / have
comen to me in prison and councelled me besely / and coueted greatly that I
should do the same thing. And other brethren have sent to me and required me
on gods behalf yt I should write out and make known both mine apposing and
mine answeri^g for ye profet yt (as they say) over my knowlegi^g may come
thereof. But this they badde me yt I should be besye in all my wits to go as
nere ye sentence and ye words as I could both that were spoken to me and yt I
spoke. Up aue^ture this writing came a another time before ye Archebishope and
his counsel. And of this cou^selling I was right glad: for in my conscience I
was moved to do this thing / and to ask hereto ye special help of god. And
so tha^ I considering ye great desire of diverse fre^des of sundry places
according all in one: I occupied all my mind and my writtes so besyly yt
through gods grace I perceived by their meyning and their charitable desire
some profete might come there throw. For sothe fastenesse and troth has these
co^dicio^s. Where ever it is impugned: yt has a sweet smell and thereof comes
a sweet savoure. And ye more violently ye enemies dress the^ self to oppress
and to withstond ye truth ye greater and the sweter smell comes thereof. And
therefore this heavenly smell of gods word will not as a smoke pass away
with the wind: but it will descend and rest in some clean souleth at
thrusts there after. And thus somedele by this writing may be perceived
throw gods grace how yt the enemies of the truth standing boldly in there
malice enforce the^ to witstonde ye fredome of christ's gospel / for which
fredome Christ became man / and shed his heart blood. And therefore it is
great pytte and sorrow that many me^ and women do their own weywart will: nor
besye them not to know nor to do the plesaunt will of God. Ye / men and women
that hear the truth and sothefastenesse / and hear or know of this /
perceiving what is now in the church / ought here throw to be the more moved
in all there wits to able them to grace / and to set lesser pryse by them
self / that they without tariynge forsake wilfully and bodily all the
wrechednesse off this life / syns they know not how soon / nor wha^ / nor
where / nor by whom god will teach them and assaye their patience. For no
doubt who that ever will live piteously that is charitably in Christ Jesus
shall suffer now here in this life persecucyon in one wise or a another / that
is if we shall be sauyd: Yt behouyth us to ymagyn full besyly / the vilite and
foulness of sin and how the lord god is displeased therefore: and so of
this vilite of hydousnesse of sin it behouyth us to besye us in all our
wits for to abhor and hold in our mind a great shame of sin ever / and
so than we owe to sorrow heartily therefore / and ever fliyng all occasyo^
thereof. And tha^ behooves us to take upon us sharp penance contynuynge
therein for to obtain of the lord forgiveness of our fore done sins / and
grace to abstain us hereafter from sin. And but if we enforse us to do this
wilfully / and inconvenient time / the lord (if he will not utterly destroy
and cast us away) will in diverse manners move tyrants against us for to
constreyne us violently for to do penance / which we would not do wilfully.
And trust that this doing is a special grace of the Lord / and a great
token of life and mercy. And no doubt who ever will not apply him self (as is
said before) to ponyshe him self wilfully / another will suffer patiently
mekely and gladly the rod of the Lord how so ever that he will punysshe
him: their waywarde wylles and their ynpacience are unto them earnyste of
everlasting dampnacyon. But because there are but few in number that do able
them thus faithfully to grace for to live here symply and purely and without
gall of malice and of grudgyng herefore the lovers of this world hate and
pursue them that they know pacyent / meke / chaste and wylfully poere / hatyng
and fleyng all worldly vanites and flesshely lusts. For suerly their virtuous
condicyons ar even contrary to the manners of this world. The third thing that
moeuyth me to write this se^te^ceys this. I thought I shall besye me in myself
to do feythfully that all men and women occupiyng all their besynes in knowing
and in keeping of goddys co^maundmentys able them so to grace that they might
understand treuly the treuthe and have and use verteu and prudence: and so to
serve to be lychrenyd from above with heavenly wysdom: so that all their wordys
and their workys may be hereby made plesaunt sacrifices unto the lord god: and
not only for help for their own soulys but also for edificacyon of all holy
church. For I doubt not but all they that will apply the^ to have this
foreseyd business shall profere full mekyll both to frendys and to foes. For
some enemies of ye treut he throw the grace of god shall throw charitable
folks be made astoonyd in their conscience / and paraue^ture conuertyd from
vices to verteuys / and also they yt labor to know and to keep feythfully
the byddynges of god and to suffer patiently all aduersites shall here by
comfort many fre^dys And the fourte thing that moeuyth me to write this
se^te^ce is this I know my sodeyn and vnwarnyd apposyng and ansueryng yt all
they yt will of good heart without feynyng able the^ self wifully and gladly
after their connyng and their powere to follow christ patiently / trauelyng
besyly pryuely and apertly in work and in word to withdraw who so ever that
they may from vices plantyng in them (if they may) virtues / co^fortyng them
and fortheryng them that stondyeth in grace: so that therwyth they be not borne
up into vein glory throw presumpcyon of their wisdom / nor enflamyd with
any worldly prosperity: but ever meake and paciente / purposyng to abide
stedfastely in the will of god suffryng wylfully and gladly without onye
grutchyng what so ever rod the lord will chastyse them with: than this good
lord will not forget to comfort all soch men and women in all their
tribulacyons / and at every point of temptacyo^ that any enemy purposyth for
to do against them. Soche feythfull lovers specially / and pacient folowers of
christ / the lord sendyth his wisdom from above to them: which the
adversaries of the treuthe may not know nor understand. But throw their old
and new unshamefast sins those tyrantys and enemies of southfastnesse shall
be so blinded and obstynate in evil that they shall wene themself to do
plesaunt sacrifyces unto the lord god in their malicyouse and wrongful
persewyng and destroyeng of innocent mennys and women's bodies which men and
women for their virtuous living and for their true knoulegyng of the treuythe
and their pacyent wilful and glad sufferyng of persecutyon for ryghteuousnes
deserve throw the grace of god to be heirs of the endless bliss of heaven.
And for the fervent desire and the great love that those men have as to stand
in sothefastenesse and witness of yt / though they ben suddenly and vnwarnyd
brought forth to be apposyd of their adversaries: the holy ghost: yet that
moeuyth and reulyth them throw his charity will in the hour of their ansueryng
speak in them and show his wisdom that all their enemies shall not again
seye nor against stand lawfully. And therefore all they that are steadfast in
the feythe of god / ye / which through dilligent keeping of his comau^dementys /
and for their pacie^t sufferyng of what so ever aduersite that comes to them /
hope surely in his mercy: purposyng to stand contynually in perfyte charity
For thoes me^ and women dread not so the aduersites of this life that they will
fear (after their connyng and their power) to knowledge prudently the truethe
of goddys word / when / where / and to whom that they think their knoulegyng
may profete Ye and though therefore persecutyon come to the^ in one wise or a
another / certes they pacie^tly take hit knowing their co^uersacio^ to be in
heaven. Yt is an hye reward and a special grace of god for to have and enjoy
as ye everlasting inheritance of heaven / for the sufferyng of one persecutyon
in so short time as is the term of this life. For lo this heavenly heritage
and endless reward is the lord god him self wych is the best thing that
may be. This sentence wytnessyth ye lord god him self whereas he said to
Abraham I am thy mede. And as the lord said he was and is the mede of Abraham:
so heys of all his other seyntys This most blessed and best mede he grant to
us all for his holy name that made us of naught / and sent his only most
dear worthy son / our lord Jesus christ for to redeem us with his most
preciouse heart blood Amen.

Known be yt to all men yt read or hear this writing benethe: that on the
sunday next after the feste of saint Peter / that we call lammesse in the
year of our lord a.M.CCCC. and.vij. year. I william of Thorpe being in
preson in the castle of Saltwode was brought before Thomas Arundell
Archebysshope of Canterbury and Chaunceler than of Ingland. And when that I
came to him / he stood in a great chamber and much people about him: and when
that he saw me he went fast into a closett byddyng all seculer men that
followed him to go forth from him sone / so that no man was left than in that
closet but ye Archebysshop himself and a physician yt was called Malueren
person of saint Dunstanys in London and other two personys unknown to me which
ware minysterys of ye law. And I sta^dyng before the^ by and by the
Archebysshop said to me William / I know well yt thou have this twenty winter
and more trauelyd about besyly in ye north contre and in other diverse contres
of England sowyng about false doctrine / having great business if thou might
with thine untrue reachyng and shrewyd will for to enfecte and poison all this
land. But through ye grace of god thou art now wythstondyd and brought in to
my ward / so yt I shall now sequester the from thine evil purpose / and let
yt to enuenyme ye sheep of my prouynce. Never the less saint Paul seythe If it
may be as far as in us is we owe to have peace with all men. Therefore William
if thou will now mekely and of good heart / without onye feynyng / knele down
and leye thy hand apo^ a book and kiss yt promysyng feythfully as I shall
here charge the that thou will submytthe to my correccyon / and stand to mine
ordinance / and fulfill yt dewly by all thy connyng and power: thou shall yet
find me gracious unto ye. Than said I to ye Archebysshop. Sir syns ye deem me
an heretyke out of believe will ye give me here audience to tell my believe. And
he said / ye tell on. And I said I believe yt there is not but one god almighty /
and in this god heed and of this godhede a^ three persons / yt is ye fader / ye
son and the sothe fast holy ghost. And I believe that all these three persons
ar even in power and in connyng and in might full of grace and of all goodness
For what ^o ever that the father does or can or will / that ^hyng also ye
son does and can and will: and in all their power connyng and will ye holy
ghost is equal to the father and to ye son. Over this I believe that through
counsel of this most blessed trinite in most convenient time before ordenyd
for the salvation of man kind the second peerson of this trinite was ordenyd
to take the form of man / that is the kind of man. And I believe that this
second person our lord Jesus christ was conceiuyd thorough the holy ghost
into the womb of the most blessed virgyn Marye with out ma^nys seed. And I
believe that after nine monethys Christ was borne of this most blessed vergyn
without any pain or brekyng of the closter of her womb / and without fylthe
of her virginite. And I believe that Christ our savior was circuncisyd in the
eyghte day after his birth in fulfillyng of ye law / and his name was called
Jesus which was called of ye angel before yt he was co^ceiuyd in ye womb of
Marie his mother. And I believe yt Christ as he was about thyrty year old was
baptized in ye fludde of Iordane of John^ baptist / and in likeness of a dove
ye holy ghost descendyd there upon him: and a voice was herd from heaven
seiyng. Thou art my welblouyd son In the I am full pleasyd. And I believe that
Christ was moeuyd than by the holy ghost for to goo in to desert / and there
he fastyd forty days and forty nyghtes without bodily meat and drynk. And I
believe that by and by after his fasting when the manhood of Christ hongeryd
the feende came to him and te^ptyd him in glotony / in veyn glory / and in
couetyse / but in all thoes temptacyo^s Christ concludyd the fend and with
stood him And than with out tariyng Jesus began to preach and to seye unto the
people / do ye penance / for the realm of heaven is now at hand. And I
believe yt Christ in all his time here lived most holyly and taught the will
of his fader most trewly / and I believe that he suffered therefore most wrong
fully greatyst repreuys and despysynges. And after this when Christ would make
an end here of his temporal life. I believe that in the day next before that
he would suffer passion on the morn: In form of bread and of wine he ordenyd
ye sacrame^te of his flessh and his blood yt is his own precious body / and
gave it to his apostles for to eat / co^maundyng them and by the^ all their
after comers: yt they should do it i^ this form that he showed to them / use
them self and teach and commone forth to other men and woomen this most
worshypfull holiest sacrament / in myndefulnesse of his holiest living and of
his most true teaching / and of his wilful and pacie^t sufferyng of the most
peynfull passion And I believe yt thus Christeour savior / after yt he had
ordenid this most worthy sacrament of his own preciouse body: he went forth
wyllfully agenst his enemies / and he suffered the^ most patiently to ley their
ha^dys most violently upon him / and to bind him / and to lead him forth
as a thief / and to skorne him / and buffet and all to blow or fyle him with
their spittinges Over this I believe that Christ suffered most mekely and
patiently his enemies for to dinge out with sharp scourges the blood that was
between his skyn and his flesh: ye without grudginge Christ suffered ye cruel
Jews to crown him with most sharp thorns and to strike him with a read. And
after Christ suffered wicked Jews to draw him out upon the cross and for to
nail him there upon foot and hand. And so through this pitiefull naylinge
Christ shed out wilfully for man's life the blood that was in his veins. And
then christ gave wilfully his spirit in to the hands or power of his father /
and so as he would and when he would Christ deid wilfully for man's sake upon ye
cross And notwithsta^dinge yt Christ was wilfully / paynfully and most
shamfully put to deeth as to the world / there was left blood and water in
his heart as he before ordened that he would shede out this blood and this
water for man's salvation. And therefore he suffered the Jews to make a blind
knight to thrust him in to the heart with a spear and this the blood and water
yt was in his heart Christ would shede out for ma^s love. And after this I
believe that Christ was taken down from the cross and buried And I believe that
on ye third day by power of his god heed Christ rose again from death to life.
And the.xl. day there after I believe that Christ ascended up in to heaven and
that he there sits on the right hand of god the father almighty. And the
tenth day after this up goinge he sent to his apostles the holy ghost that he
had promised them before. And I believe that Christ shall come and judge all
mankind / some to everlasting peace and some to everlastynge pains. And as I
believe in the father and in the son that they are one god almighty / so I
believe in the holy ghost that is also with them the same god almighti. And I
believe an holy church that is all they / that have been and that now are and
always to the end of the world shall be a people the which shall endeuer them
to know and to keep the commandments of god / dredinge over all thing to
offend god and lovynge and seeking most to please him. And I believe that all
they that have had and yet have and all they that yet shall have the foresaid
ververtuous surely standing in the belefe of god / hopyng steadfastly in his
merciful doings / co^tinuynge to their end in perfect charity / wilfully /
patiently and gladly soferynge persecucio^s / by the example of Christ chefly
and his apostles / all these have their names written in the book of life.
Therefore I believe that the gaderynge together of this people living now here in
this life is the holy church of god feyghtynge here on earth against the fend
/ the prosperyte of the world and their fleshely lusts. Wherefore seeing that
all the gadering together of this church before said and every part thereof
another coueteth nor wills nor loves nor seeks any thing but to eschew the
offense of god and to do his pleasynge will: mekely / gladly and wilfully of
all mine heart I submitt my self unto this holy church of christ to be ever
buxsom and obediente to the ordinance of it and of every member thereof after
my knowledge and power by the help of god. Therefore I knowledge now and evermore
shall / if god will / that of all my heart and off all my might I will submyt
me only to the rule and governance of them whom after my knowledge I may
perceave by the havynge and using of the beforesayd virtues to be members of
the holy church. Wherefore these articles off belefe and all other both of the
old law and of the new / which after the commandment of god any man
ought to believe / I believe verily in my soul as a synnefull deedly wretch of
my cunning and power ought to believe prayenge the lord god for his holy
name for to increase my belefe and help my unbelief. And for because to the
praysynge of gods name I desire above all thing to be a faithful membre of
holy church I make this protestacyon before you all four that are now here
present / covetynge that all men and women that now absente knew the same /
that what thing so ever before this time I have said or done / or what thing
here I shall do or say / at any time here after. I beleve that all the old
law and the new law given and ordened by the council of these three persons
of the trynite were given and written to the salvation off mankind. And I
believe that these laws are sufficient for man's salvation. And I believe every
article of these laws to the entente that these articles were ordened and
commanded of these three persons off the most blessed trynyte to be believed.
And therefore to the rule and the ordinance off these gods laws mekely /
gladly and wilfully I submytte me with all mine heart that who ever can or will
by ouctoryte off gods law / or by open reason / tell me that I have erred or
now err or any time here after shall err in any article of belefe (fro
which inceonvenience god keep me for his goodness) I submytte me to be
reconcyled and to be buxum and obedyente unto these laws of god and to every
article of them. For by auctorite / specially of these laws / I will / through
the grace of god / be united charitably unto these laws. Ye sir and over this
I believe and admytte all the sentences / auctorites and reasons off the
saynctes and doctoures according unto holy scripture and declarynge it truly.
I submytte me wylfully and mekely to be ever obediente after my conning and
power to all these saynctes and doctoures as they are obedyente in work and in
word to god and to his law / and forther not to my knowledge no^ for any
erthly power dignite or state / through the help of god. But Sir I pray you
tell me if after your biddyng I shall lay my hand upon the book to the
entente to swear thereby? And the Archebishope said to me / ye / wherefore
else? And I said to him. Sir a book is no thing else but a thing coupled
together of diverse creatures / and to swear by any creature both gods law and
man's law is against. But Sir this thing I say here to you before these your
clerckes / with my foresaid protestacion / that how where / when and to whom
men are bou^de^ to swear or to obey in any wise after gods law and saints
and true doctors according with gods law: I will through gods grace be ever
ready thereto with all my conning and power. But I pray you sir for ye charity of
god yt ye will before that I swear as I have here rehearsed to you tell me how
or whereto yt I shall submytt me: and show me whereof yt ye will correct me:
and what is the ordinance that ye will thus oblige me to fulfill.

And ye Archbishop seid unto me. I will shortly that now thou swear here to
me that thou shall forsake all the opinions which the sect of Lollardes hold
/ and is slaundred with: so that after this time another pryuely nor apertly
thou hold any opinion which I shall after that thou haste sworn rehearse to y^
here. Nor thou shall fauer no man nor woman / young nor old yt holds any of
these foreseid opinions: but after thy knowledge and power thou shall enforsethe
to withstand all soche distroblers of holy church in every diocese that thou
come in: and the^ that will not leave their false and dampnable opinions thou
shall putt them up publeshyng them and their names / and make them known to ye
bishope of the diocese that they are in or to the bishopes mynistres. And over
this I will that thou preach no more unto the time that I know by good witness
and true yt thy co^uersacion be soch that thy heart and thy mouth accord
treuly in one co^trariyng all ye leude learning that thou have taught here
before.

And I hearing these words thought in my heart that this was an unlawful a
sting: and I demyd myself cursed of god / if I consented hereto and I thought
how Susan seid. Anguyssch is to me on every side. And in yt I stood still and
spoke not / the Archbishop seid to me. Answer one wise or a another. And I
seid. Sir / if I consented to you thus / as ye have here rehearsed to me / I
should become an appelar / or every bishopis espy / somonour of all England.
For and I should thus put up / and publeshe ye names of me^ and women I should
here in deceive full many persons: ye sir as it is likely by ye dome of my
conscience I should herein because of ye death both of me^ and women ye both
bodily and gostely. For many me^ and women that stand now in ye treuthe / and
are in ye way of salvation: if I should for the learning and reding of their
believe publeshe the^ and put the^ therefore up to bisshopes or to their
vnpituouse ministers I know some dele by experience yt they should be so
distrobled and diseased with persecucio^ or other wise yt many of the^ (I
think) would rather chose to forsake the way of treuthe tha^ to be traueled
skorned and slaundred or punished as bishopes and their ministres now use for
to constreyne men and women to consent to the^. But I find in no place in holy
scripture / that this office yt ye would now enfeffe me with accordith to any
priste off christ's sect / nor to any other christian man. And therefore to do
thus werto me a full noyeous bo^de to be bounde^ with and over greuouse charge.
For I suppose yt if I thus deed many men and women would / ye sir / might justly
unto my confusion sey to me / that I were a traitur to god and to them: syns (as
I think in mine heart) many me^ and women trust so mekle in me in this case /
yt I would not for saving of my life do thus to the^ For if I thus should do
full many me^ and women would (as they might full truly sey / that I had
fasly and cowerdly forsaken the truth / and slaundred shamefully the word of
god. For if I consented to you to do hereafter your will for bonchefe or
mischef yt may befall to me in this life / I deem in my conscience yt I were
worthy herefore to be cursed of god and also of all his soynctes / fro which
inconvenience keep me and all christen people almighti god now and ever for his
holy name* And than the Archbishop seid unto me. O thine heart is full hard
endured as was yt herre of Pharao / and the deuell has over come^ the and
perverted the / and he has so blinded the in all thy wits / that thou haste
no grace to know the treuthe / nor ye mesure of mercy yt I have proffered to
ye. Therefore as I perceive now by thy folish answer / thou have no will to
leave thine old errors. But I sey to ye leude losell / other thou quikly
consent to mine ordinance and submit ye to stand to my decrees: or by
saint Thomas thou shall be disgraded / and follow thy fellow in Smithfelde. And
at this seeing I stood still and spoke not / but I thought in mine heart yt god
did to me a great grace / if he would of his great mercy bring me to soch an
end. And in mine heart I was nothing frayde with this menasi^g of ye
archbishop. And I considered there.ij. things in hi^. One / yt he was not yet
soroufull for yt he had made William Soutre wrongfully to be burnt. And as I
considered that ye Archbishop thyrsted yet after more shedi^g out of innocent
blood. And fast therefore I was moved in all my wits for to hold ye
archbishop another for prelate nor for priest of god / and for ye mine inward
man was thus altogether departed from ye archbishop me thought I should not
have any dread of hi^. But I was right heavy and soroufull for yt there was none
audience of seculer me^ by: but in mine heart I praid ye lord god for to comfort
me and strengith me against the^ yt there ware against the sothefastenesse.
And I purposed to speak no more to the Archebisshop and his clerckes than me
need behooved: and all thus I prayed god for his goodness to give me than and
always grace to speak with a meke and an easy spyrit: and what soever thing
yt I should speak that I might thereto have true authorites of scriptures or
open reason. And for yt I stood thus still and nothing spoke / one of the
Archebisshopes clerks seid unto me.

What thing musiste thou? do thou as my lord has now commanded to the here.

And yet I stood still and answered him not / and than sone after ye
Archebishope seid to me. Art thou not yet bethought / whether thou will do /
as I have here seid to the? And I seid tha^ to him.

Sir my father and my mother on whose souls god have mercy (if it be his will)
spent mekyll money in diverse places about my learning for the intent to have
made me a priest to god. But when I came to years of discrecion / I had no
will to be preiste / and therefore my fre^des were right heavy to me / and tha^
me thought their grudgi^g agenst me was so peynfull to me / yt I purposed
therefore to have left their company. And when they perceived this in me they
spoke some time full feire and plesaunt words to me: but for yt they might not
make me to consent of good heart to be a preiste / they spoke to me full often
times very grievous words / and manassed me i^ diverse manners shewi^g to me
full heavy chere. And thus one while i^ feire manner / a another while in grievous
they were long time as me thought full besy about me or I co^sentid to the^ to
be a priest. But at ye last wha^ in this matter they would no longer suffer
mine excusacions / but other I should consent to the^ or I should ever bear
their indignacion / ye / their curse (as they seide) Tha^ I seeing this praid
them that they would give me license for to go to them that were named wise
priestis and of verteuous conversation to have their counsel / and to know of
them the office and the charge of priesthode. And hereto my father and my
mother consented full gladly / and gave me their blissing and good leave to go
/ and also money to spend in this journey. And so than I went to tho priestis
whom I herd to be of best name / and of most holy living / and best
learnid / and most wise of heavenly wisdom: and so I communed with them unto
the time that I perceiuyd by their verteuous and continual occupacions yt
their honest and charitable werkis passid their fame which I herd before of
them. Wherefore sir by the example of the doctrine of them / and specially for
the godly and innocent workis which I perceived than of them and in them / after
my conning and power I have exercised me than and in this time to know
perfectly goddis law / having a will and a desire to live there after / willing
that all men and women exercised the^ self feithfully there about. If than sir
other for pleasure or displeasure of them that are another so wise / nor of so
verteuouse conversation to my knowledge / nor by comone fame to any other mannis
knoulege in this land as these men were of whom I took my counsel and
informacion: I should now forsake thus suddenly and shortly and vnwarnid all
the learning yt I have exercised my self in this thirty winter and more. My
conscience should ever be herewith out of mesure vnquietid / and as sir I know
well that many men and women should be there throw greatly troublid and
sclaunderid / and as I seid sir to you before. For mine vntrewthe and false
cowardnesse many a one should be put into full great reprefe / ye sir I dread /
that many a one (as they might than justly / would curse me full bitterly /
and sir I fear not / but the curse of god / which I should deserve here in /
would bring me to a full evil end / if I continewid thus. And if through
remorse of conscience I repe^tid me any time retourning in to the way / wych /
you do your diligence to constreine me now to forsake / ye sir / all ye
bisshopis of this land with full many other priestis would defame me / and
pursew me as a relapse / and they that now have (though I be unworthy) some
confidence in me here after would never trust to me though I cowlde teach and
live never so verteuously more than I can or may. For if after your counsel I
left utterly all my learning / I should hereby first wound and defyle mine
own soul / and also I should here through give occasion to many men and women
of full sore hurting / ye sir as it is likely to me / if I consentid to your
will I should herein by mine evil example in it / as far as in me were / slay
many folk gostely / that I should never deserve for to have grace of god to
the edifiyng of his church another of my self / nor of none other man's life:
and undone both before god and man. But sir by example chefely of some whose
names I will not now rehearse / H / of I / P / and B / and also by the present
doing of Philip of Ra^penton that is now become^ Bishop of Lincoln I am now
learnid as many mo hereafter through goddis grace shall be learnid / to hate and
to fle all soche sclau^der yt these foreseid men chefely has defiled
principally the^ selfs with. And in it yt in the^ is they have enuenemid all
ye church of god for ye sclaunderous reuokyng at ye cross of paulis of H. P.
and of B / and how now Philip Ra^penton persewith cristis people. And ye
feining / yt these men dissemble by worldly prudence keeping the^ cowerdly in
their preaching and communyng within the bondis and termis (which without blame
may be spokyn and shewid out to the most worldly lyuers) will not be
vnponisshid of god. For to the point of trewthe that these men shewid out some
time they will not now streche forth their lives. But by example each one of
them as their wordis and their workis show they besy them through their
feinyng: for to sclaunder and to persewe Christ in his members / rather than
they will be persewid.

And the Archebisshop seid to me. These men the which thou spekist of now were
foolis and heretics: when they were countid wise men of the and other soche
loselles. But now they are wise men / though thou and soche other deny them
unwise. Nevertheless I wiste never none / that right seide / that any while
were enuenymed with your contagiousnesse / that is / contaminate and spottid
doctrine.

And I seid to the Archebisshop. Sir I think well that these men and soche
other ar now wise as to this world / but as their wordis sou^did sometime and
their workis shewid outwardly / it was likely to move me yt they had earneste
of the wisdom of god / and that they should have deseruid mikell grace of god
to have sauyd their own souls and meny other mennis if they had continewid
feithfully in wilful pouerte and in other simple verteuous living and
specially / if they had with these foreseide vertueis continewid in their besy
fruitful sowing of goddis word: as to many mennys knoulege they occupied the^
a season in all their wits full besyly to know the plesaunt will of god /
trauelyng all their me^bres full besily for to do there after / purely and
chefely to the praising of the most holy name of god / and for grace of
edificacion and salvation of christian people But woe worth false couetise / and
evil counsel / and tyranny by wiche they and many men and women ar led
blyndely into an evil end.

Than the Archebisshop seide to me. Thou and soche other losellis of thy sect
would shave your berdis full nere for to have a benefice. For by Jesus I know
none more couetouse shrewis than ye ar / when that ye have a benefice. For lo I
gave to John^ Puruay / a benefice but a mile out of this castle / and I herd
more compleintis about his covetousness for tithes and other mysdoyngys than
I did of all men that were auauncid within my diocese.

And I seid to the Archebisshop. Sir puruay is another with you now for the
benefice yt ye gave him / nor he holdith feithfully with the learning that he
tawght and writ before time and thus he shewith him self another to be hot nor
cold: and therefore he and his felaws may sore dread that if they torn not
hastily to ye way that they have forsakyn: paraue^ture they be put out of the
nombre of cristis chosyn people.

And the Archebisshop seid. Though Puruay be now a false harlot I quyte me to
him / but come he more for soche cause before me: or we depart I shall know
with whom he holdith. But I sey to the. Which ar these holy me^ and wise of
whom thou haste takyn thine informacion.

And I seid. Sir / Master John Wicleff was holden of full many men the
greatiste clerk that they knew than living / and therewith he was namid a
passing ruely man and an ynnocent in his living and herefore great men
commonyd often with him and they louyd so his learning that they writ it / and
besily enforsid them to rule themself there after. Therefore sir this foreseid
learning of Master John Wicleff is yet holden of full many men and women the
most agreeable learning unto the living and teaching of Criste and of his
Apostles / and most openly showing and declaring how the church of Criste
has been and yet should be rewlid and gouernid. Therefore so many men and women
covet this learning / and purpose / thorough goddis grace to conform their
living like to this learning of Wicleff. Master John aiston tawght and writ
accordingly and full besily where and when / and to whom that he might / and he
vsid it himself right perfitely unto his life's end. And also Philip of
Rampenton while he was a chanone of Lacester / Nicolas Herforde Dauy Gotray of
Pakring monk of Bylande and a master of divinity / and John Purnay and many
other which were holden right wise men and prudent tawcht and writ besily this
forseid learning and conformid them thereto. And with all these men I was often
right homely and communyd with them long time and often: and so before all other
men I choes wilfully to be infourmyd of them and by them and specially of
Wicleff himself / as of the most verteuous and godly wise me^ that I herd of
or knew. And therefore of him specially and of these men I took the learning
that I have tauchte and purpose to live there after (if god will) to my lives
end. For though some of these men be contrary to the learning that they taucht
before I wot well yt their learning was true which they tauchte: and therefore
with the help of god I purpose to hold and to use the learning which I hard
of the^ / while they sat on Moses chair / and specially while that they sat
on the chair of Criste. But after ye werkis that they now do I will not do
with goddis help. For they feyne and hyde and contrary the trewthe which
before they taucht out plenily and trewly. For as I know well when some of these
men has been blamyd for their sclaunderous doing / they grant not that they
have tauchte a miss or crryd beforetyme / but yt they were constreinyd by
peine to leave to tell out the sothe / and thus they choese now rather to
blaspheme god than to suffer awhile here persecucion bodily for sothefastnesse
that Christ shed out his heart blood for.

And the Archebisshop seid. That learning that thou callist trewthe and
sothefastnesse is open sclaunder to holy church / as it is prouyd of holy
church. For all be it / that Wicleff your autour was a great clerk and though
that many men held him a perfect liver yet his doctrine is not approuyd of
holy cherche but many sentencis of his learning ar da^pnyd as they well worthy
ar. But as touching Philip of Ra^peton yt was first chanone and after Abbot of
Lacester which is now bishop of Lincoln: I tell the that the day is comen for
which he fastyd the euene. For another he holds now / nor will holdethe
learning that he thaughte when he was a Chanon of Lacester. For no bishop of
this land persewith now more sharply them that hold thy way than he does.

And I seid. Sir full many men and women wonderith upon him and speakith him
mekill shame and holdith him for a cursid enemy of the treuthe.

And the Archebisshop seid to me. Wherefore tarieste thou me thus here with
soche fables / will thou shortly (as I have seid to the) submit the to me or
no?

And I seid. Sir I tell you at one word / I dare not for the dread of god
submitt me to you after the tenor and sentence that ye have above rehearsed to
me.

And than as if he had been wroth he seid to one of his clerkis. Fetch hider
quikely the certificacio^ that came to me fro Shrewisbury under the bailiues
seal witnessing the errors and heresies which this losell has venemously
sown there.

Than hastily the Clerk took out / and leid forth on a cupborde diverse
rollis and writingis / among which there was a little one / which ye clerk
delivered to the Archebisshop. And by and by the Archebisshop read this roll
co^teinyng this sentence.

The third sunday after easter the year of our lord.M.CCCC. and seven /
William Thorpe came unto the town of Shrewisbury / and through leave granted
unto him to preach: He said openly in saint Chaddis church in his sermon /
that the Sacrament of the altar after the consecracion was material bread.
And ye images should in no wise be worshipped. And that men should not go on
pilgremages. And that priests have no title to tithes. And that it is not
lefull for to swear in any wise.

And when the Archbishop had red thus this roll / he rolled it up ageyn / and
said to me. Is this wholesome learning to be among the people?

And I said to him. Sir I am both ashamed on their behalf and right soroufull
for the^ that have certified you these things thus untruely: for I preached
never nor taught thus privily nor apertly.

And the Archbishop said to me. I will give credence to these worshipful men
which have written to me and witnessed under their sealis there among them.
Though thou now deniest this: wenist thou yt I will give credence to the? Thou
losell have trobled ye worshipful cominalte of Shrewisbury / so that the
bailives and cominalte of that town have written to me praynge me that am
Archbishop of Caunterbury / primate and Chaunceler of England / that I will
vouchsafe to grant them / that if thou shall be made (as thou art worthy) to
suffer open Iouresse for thine heresies / that thou may have thy youresse
openly there among them: so that all they whom thou and soche other loselles
have there perverted / may through fear of thy deed be reconsyled ageyn to the
unite of holy church. And also they that stand in true faith of holy church
may through thy deed be more stablisshed therein. And as if this askyng had
pleased the Archbishop / he said. By my thrifte this hartye prayoure and
feruente request shall be thought on.

But certeynly another the prayer of the men of Shrewisbery / nor the manassynge
of the Archebishoppe made me any thing a frayde. But in rehersyng of this
malice and in the hearing of it my heart greatly reioysed and yet does. I
thank god for the grace that I than thought and yet think shall come to all
the church of god here through / by the special merciful doing of the
lord. And as having no dread of the malice of tyrauntes / by trusting
steadfastly in the help of the lord with full purpose for to knowledge the
sothefastnesse / and to stand thereby after my connyng and power I said to the
Archbishop. Sir if the truth of gods word might now be accepted as it should
be / I doubt not to prove by lykely evidence / that they that are famed to be
out of the faith of holy church in Shrewisbery and in other places also are in
the true faith of holy church. For as their words sound / and their works
show to ma^nis judgment dreading and loving faithfully god their will / their
desire / their love / and their besinesse are most set to dread to offend
god / and to love for to please him in true and faithful keeping of his
commandments. And agene they yt are said to be in the faith of holy church
in Shrewisbery and in other places / by open evidence of their proud /
enuiouse / maliciouse / couetouse lecherouse and other foul words and works
another know nor have will to know nor to occupye their wits truly and
effectuously in the right faith of holy church. Wherefore all these nor none
that follow their manners shall any time come verily in the faith of holy
church / except they enforce them more truly to come in the way which
now they despise. For these men and women that are now called feyth full and
holden just / another know nor will exercise them self to know of
faythfulnesse one commandment of god. And thus full many men and women now /
and specially me^ that are named to be principal lymmes of holy church stiere
god to great wrath and deserve his curse for that they call or hold them
just men which are full unjust as their vicyouse words / their great
customable sweringe / and their slau^derouse and shameful works show openly
and witness. And herefor soche viciouse men and unjust in their own
confusyon call them unjust men and women / which after their power and conning
besy them self to live justly after the commandment of god. And where sir ye
say / that I have distrobled the cominalte of Shrewisbery and many other men
and women with my teaching / if it thus be / it is not to be wondered of wise
men / syns all the cominalte of the cite of Jerusalem was destrobled off
christ's own person that was very god and man and most prudent precher that
ever was or shall be. And also all the Synagoge of Nazareth was moved ageynste
Christ and so fulfilled with ire toward him for his preachinge / that the
men of the Synagoge rose up and cast ch^iste out of their cite / and led him
up to the top of a mountain for to cast him down there hedelinge. Also
accordingly hereto the lord witnessyth by Moses / that he shall put dissension
betwixt his people and the people that contrarieth and persewith his people.
Who sir is he yt shall preach the treuthe of gods word to ye vnfeithfull
people / and shall let the sothe fastenesse of ye gospel and the prophecye of
god almightye to be fulfilled?

And the archbishop said to me. It follows of these thy words / yt thou and
soche other thi^kest yt ye do right well for to preach and teach as ye do
without authorite of any bishope. For ye presume / that ye lord has chosen
you only for to preach as faithful disciples and special folowars of Christ

And I said. Sir by authorite of gods law and also of seintes and doctors I
am learned to deem / yt it is every priests office and deutie for to preach
besily freely and truly ye word of god. For no doubt every priest should
purpose first in his soul and couett to take ye order of priesthode chefly for
to make known to ye people ye word of god after his conning and power
approuyng his words ever to be true by his virtuous works and for this intent
we suppose ye bishopes and other prelates of holy chirch should chefely take and
use there prelacie. And for the same cause / bishopes should give to priests
their orders. For bisshopes should accept no man to priesthode except that he
had good will and full purpose / and were well disposed / and well learned to
preach. Wherefore sir by the bidding of Christ and by example of his most holy
living and also by ye witnessinge of his holy apostles and prophets we are
bound under full great pain to exercise us after our co^ning and power (as
every priest is like wise charged of god) to fulfill dewly the office of
priesthode. We presume not here of our selfs for to be esteemed (another in
our own reputacio^ nor in none other man's) feithfull disciples and special
folowers of Christ: but sir / as I said to you before / we deem this by
authorite chefely of gods word / that it is ye chief deutie of every priest
to besy them feithfully to make ye law of god known to his people / and so to
comune the commandment of god charitably how that we may best / where /
when / and to whom y^ ever we may is our very deutie. And for the will and
business that we owe of dew debt to do justly our office through the
steyring and special help (as we trust) of god / hoping stedfastely in his
mercy / we desire to be the feithfull disciples of christ: and we pray this
gracious lord for his holy name / that he make us able so to please him with
devout prayers and charitable priestly works / that we may obtain of him to
follow him thankfully.

And the Archbishop said to me. Lewd losell whereto makist thou soche vein
reasones to me. Asks not saint Paul / how should priests preche / except
they be sent? But I sent ye never to preche. For thy venomous doctrine is so
known through out England / yt no bishop will admit the for to preach by
witnessyng of their letters. Why than lewd ydiote willest thou presume to
preach / syns thou art not sent nor licensed of thy souereyn to preach. Says
not saint Paul / that subictes owe to obey their souereyns / and not only
good and virtuous: but also tyrauntis that are vicious?

And I said to the archbishop. Sir / as touching your letter of license or
other bishopes / which ye say we should have to witness yt we were able to be
sent for to preach? we know well yt another you sir / nor any other bishop of
this land will grant to us any soche letters of license but we should oblige
us to you and to other bisshopes by unlawful oaths for to pass not ye bo^des
and terms which ye sir or other bishopes will lymyt to us. And sins i^ this
matter your termis be some to large / and some to streite we dare not oblige us
thus to be bou^de^ to you for to keep ye terms / which you will lymitt to us /
as ye do to friars and soch other prechers: and therefore though we have not your
letter sir nor letters of other bishops written with ynke upon percheme^t: we
dare not here for leave ye office of preching / to which preching all priests
after there co^nyng and power are bound by diverse testimonies of gods law
and off great doctors without any me^cio^ maki^g of bishopes letters. For as
mekell as we have taken upon us ye office of priesthode (though we are unworthy
thereto) we come and purpose to fulfill it with ye help of god by authorite of
his own law / and by witness of great doctors and seintes accordingly
hereto trusting steadfastly in ye mercy of god. For yt he commands us to do
the office of priesthode / he will be our sufficient letters and witness / if
we by example of his holy living and teaching specially occupye us feithfully
to do our office justly / ye ye people to whom we preach / be they feithfull
or vnfeithfull shall be our letters yt is our witness berers. For ye treuthe
where it is sown may not be vnwitnessed. For all that are converted and saved
by learning of gods word and by working thereafter are witness berers / yt
the trewith and sothfastnesse which they hard and did after is cause off
their salvation. And ageyn / all vnfeythfull me^ and women which herd the
treuthe told out to the^ and would not do there after: also all they that
might have herd the treuthe and would not hear it / because that they would
not do thereafter / all these shall bear witness against them selfs / and the
treuth which they would not hear / or else harden and despised to do thereafter
through their vnfeythfulnesse: is and shall be cause of their da^pnacion.
Therefore sir / syns this forseide witnessing of god and of diverse seintes and
doctors / and off all ye people good and evil suffices to all true prechers:
we think that we do not ye office of presthode / if that we leave our
preaching / because yt we have not or may not have dewly bisshopes letters to
witness that we are sent of the^ to preach. This sentence approves saint
Paul / when he speaks of him self and of feithfull apostles and disciples
saing thus. We neade no letters of co^me^dacion as some other preachers do /
which preach for covetousness of te^porall goods and for me^nes praising. And
where ye say sir yt paul bids subjects obey their souereyns / this is soth /
and may not be denied. But there is.ij. manner of souereyns / virtuous suffere^ys
and vicious tyrau^tes. Therefore to these last souereyns another me^ nor women yt
be subject owe to obey i^.ij. manners To virtuous suffereins and charitable /
subictes owe to obey wilfully and gladly / in heari^g of their good counsel /
i^ co^senti^g to their charitable biddinges / and in werkynge after their
fruitful works This sentence Paul approves where he says thus to subiectis.
Be ye mindful of your souereyns that speak to you the word of god / and
follow you the feithe of them whose conversation you know to be verteuous. For as
Paul says after / these souereyns to whom subiectis owe to obey in following
of their manners / work besily in holy studiyng / how they may withstand and
destroy vices first in themself / and after in all their subiectis / and how
they may bes^e plant in them virtues. Also these souereyns make devout and
fervent prayers for to purchase grace of god / that they and their subiectis
may over all thing dread to offend him and to love for to please him. Also
these souereyns to whom Paul bids us obey as it is seid before live so
virtuously that all they that will live well may take of them good example to
know and to keep the commaundmentis of god. But in this foreseid wise /
subiectis owe not to obey nor to be obedient to tyrauntis / while they are
vicious tyrauntis / syns their will / their counsel / their biddingis / and
their workis ar so vicious that they owe to be hatid and left. And though
soche tyrauntis be masterfull and cruel in bostyng and manasing in oppressions
and diverse punysshyngis: saint Petyr bids the seruauntis of soche tyrau^tis
to obey mekely to soche tyrauntis / suffering patiently their malicious
cruelnes. But Petyr counsellith not any servant or subject to obey to any
lord or prince or souereyn in any thing that is not pleasing to god.

And the Archebesshop said unto me. If a souereyn bid his subject do that
thing that is vicious / this souereyn herein is to blame: but the subject for
his obedience deserves mede of god For obedience pleasith more to god than any
sacrifice.

And I said. Samuel the prophet said to Saul the wicked king / yt god was more
pleased with the obedience of his commandment than with any sacrifice of
bestis. But David says / and saint Paul / and saint Gregory accordingly to
gither / that not only they yt do evil is worthy of death and dampnacion:
but also all they that consent to evil doers. And sir ye law of holy church
teachith in the decrees / that no servant to his lord / nor child to the
father or mother / nor wife to her husbond / nor monk to his abot ought to
obey except in lefull thingis and lawful.

And the Archebisshop said to me. All these allegingis that thou bring forth
are not else but proud presumptuousnes. For hereby thou enforcist the to prove /
that thou and soche other ar so just / that ye owe not to obey to prelatis.
And thus agenst the learning of saint Paul yt teachith you not to preach but
if ye were sent / of your own authorite ye will go forth and preach and do
what ye list.

And I said. Sir / presentith not every priest the office of the apostles / or
the office of the disciples of Christ? And the Archebisshop said ye. And I
said. Sir as the tenthe chaptre of Matthew and the last chaptre of Mark
witnesses / Christ sent his apostles for to preach. And the tenthe chaptre
of Luke witnesses that Christ sent his two and seventy disciples for to
preach in every place that Christ was to come to. And saint Gregory in the
common law says / that every man that goth to priesthode takith upon him the
office of preaching: for as he says / that priest steirith god to great
wrath of whose mouth is not herd ye voice of preaching And as other more
gloses upon Ezechiel witness / that ye priest that prechith not besily to the
people shall be part taker of their dampnacion that perisshe through his
defaute: and though ye people besauyd by other special grace of god tha^ by ye
priestis preaching / yet the priestis / in ye they are ordenyd to preach and
preach not / as before god they are ma^^^ears For as far as in the^ is /
soche priests as preach not besily and trewly sleeth all ye people gostely in
that they with hold from the^ the word of god that is life and sustenau^ce of
me^nis souls. And saint Isidore says Priestis shall be da^pnid for
wickidnesse of the people / if they teach not the^ yt ar ignorant: or blame
not the^ yt ar sinners. For all yt work or besinesse of priestis sta^dith in
preaching and teaching that they edifye all men as well by connyng of feithe /
as by discipline of works / that is virtuous teaching. And as the gospel
witnessith: Christ said in his teaching. I am borne and come^ in to this
world to bear witness to ye trewthe and he that is of the trewthe hearith my
voice. Than sir syns by the word of Christ specially / that is his voice /
priestis ar commaundid to preach: what so ever priest that it be that has
not good will and full purpose to do thus / and ableth not himself after his
conning and power to do his office by the example of Christ and of his
apostles / what so ever other thing that he does displeasith god. For lo saint
Gregory says / that thing left / that a man is bound chefely to do / what
so ever other thing that a man does / it is unthankful to ye holy ghost: and
therefore says Lincoln. That priest that preachith not ye word of god though
he be siene to have none other defaute / he is Antichriste and Sathanas / a
night thief / and a day thief / a slear of souls and an angel of light
toornid in to derkenesse Wherefore sir / these authorites and other well
considerid / I deem my self da^pnable / if Iother for pleasure or displeasure
of any creature apply me not diligently to preach the word of god. And in
the same dampnacio^ I deem all those priestis which of good purpose and will
enforse them not besily to do thus / and also all them that have purpose or
will to let any priest of this besinesse.

And the Archebisshop said to those three clerkis yt stood before him. Lo syrs
/ this is ye manner and besinesse of this losell and soche other to pike out
soche sharp sentencis of holy scripture and of doctoris to maintain their
sect and lore ageinste ye ordinance of holy church. And therefore losell it
is that thou couetist to have ageyn the psalter that I made to betakyn from yt
at Ca^turbery / to record sharp versys a gei^st us. But thou shall never have
that psalter / nor none other book / till that I know that thy heart and thy
mouth accord fully to be gouernid by holy church.

And I said. Sir all my will and power is and ever shall be (I trust to god)
to be gouernyd by holy church

And the Archebisshop askid me / what was holy church.

And I said / sir I told you before / what was holy church: but syns ye ask
me this demand: I call Christ and his seyntis holy church.

And the Archebisshop said unto me. I wot well that Christ and his seyntis ar
holy church in heuene / but what is holy church in earth?

And I said. Sir though holy church be every one i^ charity / yet it has two
partis. The first and principal part has over comen perfitely all the
wretchedness of this life / and reigns joyfully in heuene with Christ. And
the the other part is here yet in earth / besily and continually fighting day and
night against temptacions of the fend / forsakyng and hatyng the prosperity of
this world / despising and withstonding their flesschely lustis / which only
ar ye pilgrims of Christ / wandering toward heuene by steadfast feithe / and
groundid hope / and by perfect charity. For these heavenly pilgremis may not /
nor will not be lettid of their good purpos by the reason of any doctors
discording fro holy scripture / nor by the fluddis of any tribulacio^ temporal
/ nor by the wind of any pride of boste or of manasing of any creature / for
they are all fast grounded upon the suer stone Ch^iste / hearing his word and
loving it / exercising the^ feithfully and continually in all their wits to
do there after.

And the Archebisshop said to his clerkis. Se ye not how his heart is endured /
and how he is traueled with ye devil / occupiyng him thus besely to allege
soche sentencis to mainteyne his errors and heresies? Certain thus he would
occupy us here all day / if we would suffer him.

One of the clerks answered. Sir / he said right now that this Certificacion
that came to you fro shrewisbery is untruely forged against him. Therefore Sir /
appose you him now here in all the poi^tis which are certified against him and
so we shall hear of his own mouth his answers / and witness them.

And the Archebisshop took the certificacio^ in his hand / and looked thereon
a while / and than he said to me.

Lo here it is certified against the by worthy men and feithfull of Shrewisbery
yt thou preachedst there openly in saint Chaddis church / that the Sacrament
of the altar was material bread after the consecracion. What say thou? Was
this trewly preached?

And I said / Sir I tell you trewly that I touchid nothing there / of the
Sacrament of ye altar / but in this wise / as I will with goddis grace tell
you here. As I stood there in ye Pulpet / besiyng me to teach ye commandment
of god / there knylled a sacring bell / and therefore mekill people toornid away
hastily / and with great noise ran fro towardis me. And I seeing this said to
them thus. Good men ye were better to stand here still and to hear goddis
word. For certis ye virtue and the mede of the most holy Sacrament of ye
altar standith mekill more in ye believe thereof / yt ye ought to have in your
soul / tha^ it does in ye outward sight thereof. And therefore ye were better
to stand still quietely to hear goddis word / because ye through ye hearing
the rof men come to very true belefe. And other wise sir I am certain I spoke
not there / of the worthy Sacrament of the altar.

And the Archebisshop said to me. I believe the not what so ever thou say /
syns so worshipful men have witnessed thus against the. But syns thou denyest
that thou saidist thus there / what say thou now? Restith there / after the
consecracion in the often material bread or no?

And I said / Sir / I know in no place in holy scripture / where this term /
material bread / is written: and therefore Sir when I speak of this matter / I
use not to speak of material bread.

Than the Archebisshop said to me. How teach thou men to believe in this
sacrament?

And I said / Sir as I believe myself so I teach other men.

He said / tell out pleinly thy believe hereof.

And I said with my protestacio^. Sir I believe that the night / before yt
Christ Jesus would suffer wilfully passion for man kind on ye morn after / he
took bread in his holy and most worshipful handis lifting up his eyes / and
gyuyng thankis to god his father / blessed this bread and brake it / and gave
it to his disciples saying to them. Take and eat of this all you? This is my
body: And that this is and ought to be all mennis belefe Matthew / Mark / Luke
/ and Paul witnessith. Other believe sir have I none / nor will have / nor
teach / for I believe yt this suffices in this matter. For in this believe with
goddis grace I purpose to live and dye / knoleging as I believe and teach other
men to believe / that the worshipful sacrament of the altar / is the
sacrament of Christis flesche and his blood in form of bread and of wine.

And the Archebisshop said to me. It is sothe that this Sacrament is very
Christis body infourme of bread. But thou and thy secret chist it to be
substance of bread. Think you this true teachinge?

And I said. Another I nor any other of the sect that ye dampne / teach any
other wise tha^ I have told you / nor believe other wise / to my knowing.
Nevertheless sir I ask of you for charity / that ye will tell me here pleynly
/ how ye shall understand this text of saint Paul / where he says thus. This
thing feale you in your self that is in Christ jesus / while he was in the
form of god. Sir / calls not Paul here the form of god / the substance
or kind of god? Also Sir: says not the church in the hours of the most
blessed virgin accordi^ly hereto / where it is written thus. Thou auctour of
health remember / that sometime thou took of the undefiled vyrgyne the form
off our body. Tell me for charity therefore / whether the form of our body
be called here the kind of our body or no?

And the Archbishop said to me. Would thou make me to declare this text
after thy purpose / syns the church has now determined / yt there abides
no substance of bread after the consecracion in the sacrament of the altar?
Beleuest thou not on this ordinance off the church?

And I said. Sir what soever prelates have ordened in the church: our believe
standith ever hooll. I have not herd that the ordinance off men under believe
/ should be putt in to believe. And the Archbishop said to me. If thou have
not learned this before / learn now to know yt thou art out of believe: if in
this matter and other thou beleuest not as holy church believes. What say
doctors treatinge of this sacrament?

And I said. Sir saint Paul yt was a great doctor of holy church speaking
to the people and teaching them the right believe of this most holy sacrament
calls it bread that we break. And also in the Canon of the mass after the
consecracion / this most worthy sacrament is called holy bread. And every
priest in this land after that he has received this sacrament says in
this wise. That thing that we have taken with our mouth / we pray god that
we may take it with a pure and clean mind. That is as I understand / we
pray god / that we may receive through very believe this holy sacrament
worthily. And sir saint Augustine says. That thing that is seen is bread: but
that mennys feithe asks to be informed of / is very christ's body. And also
Fulgence an ententyfe doctor says. As it were an error to say that Christ
was but a substance / that is very man and not very god / or to say that
Christ was very god and not very man / so is it (this doctor says) an error
to say / that the sacrament of the altar is but a substance. And also sir
acordingly hereto in ye secret of ye midde mass on Christ mass day it is
written thus. Idem refulsit deus / sic terrena substa^cia nobis co^ferat quoth
diuinum est: which sentence sir with ye secret of ye forth ferye quatuor
temporu^ septembris. I pray you sir declare here openly in english.

And the Archbishop said to me. I perceive well enough where about thou art /
and how ye deuell blyndeth the / yt thou may not understand ye ordinance of
holy church / nor consent thereto. But I command the now answer me shorly.
Beleuest thou that after ye co^secracio^ of this forsaid sacrament there
abides substance off bread or not?

And I said. Sir as I understand it is all one to grant or to believe / yt
there dwells substance of bread / and to grant and to believe / yt this
most worthy sacrament of christ's own body is one accide^t without subject.
But sir for as me kell as your asking passes mine vnderstondi^g I dare another
deny it nor grant it / for it is skole matter / about which I besyed me
never for to know it: and therefore I commit this term / accide^s sine subiecto
/ to those clerks which delyre the^ so in curiouse and suttill sophistry /
because they determine often so difficulte and strange matters / and wade and
wa^der so in the^ / from argument to argument with pro and co^tra / till yt
they wot not where they are nor understand not themself. But ye shame that
these proud sophistrers have to yield them to men and before men makes them
often foolis / and to be concluded shamefully before god.

And the Archbishop said to me. I purpose not to oblige the to the suttyll
arguments of clerks / syns thou art unable thereto: But I purpose to make the
obey to the determinacion of holy church.

And I said. Sir by open evidence and great witness a thousand year after the
i^carnacio^ of Christ ye determinacio^ which I have here before you rehearsed
was accept of holy church as sufficient to the salvation of all them that
would believe it faithfully and work thereafter charitably. But sir the
determinacion of this matter which was brought in syns the fend was losed by
friar Thomas again / specially calling ye most worshipful sacrament of
Christ's own body an accident without subject / which term syns I know not
that gods law approves it in this matter I dare not grant / but utterly I
deny to make this friars sentence or any soche other my believe / do with me
god / what thou will.

And the Archebisshop said to me. Well / well / thou shall say other wise or
that I leave the.

But what say thou to this second point yt is recorded against yt by
worthy me^ of Shrewisbury saing yt thou preachedst openly there ye images
ought not to be worshipped in any wise.

And I said. Sir I preached never thus / nor through gods grace I will not any
time consent to think nor to say thus another pryuely nor apertly. For lo /
the lord witnesses by Moses / yt the things which he made were right good /
and so than they were / and yet they are / and shall be good / and worshipful
in their kind. And therefore to the end that god made them to / they are all
preisable and worshipful and specially man that was made after the image and
likeness of god is full worshipful in his kind / ye this holy image that is
man / god worshippeth. And herefore every man should worship other in kind /
and also for heavenly virtues that me^ use charitably. Also I say / wood /
tynne / gold / silver / or any other matter that images are made of / all these
creatures are worshipful in their kind and to the end that god made them
for. But the keruyng / castyng / nor peyntyng of any ymagery made with man's
hand / all be hit that this doing be accept of man of highest state and dignite
/ and ordened of them to be a calendar to leude men that another can nor will be
learned to know god in his word / another by his creatures nor by his
wonderful and diverse worki^ges: yet this ymagery ought not to be worshipped
in the form nor in the likeness of man's craft / nevertheless that every
matter yt peinters peynte with / syns it is gods creature ought to be worshipped
in the kind / and to ye end yt god made and ordened it to serve man.

Than ye archbishop said to me. I grant well that no body owes to do
worship to any soche images for the^ self. But a crucifyxe ought to be
worshipped for the passion of christ that is peynted there in and so brought
there through to man's mind: and thus the images of the blessed trinite / and
of virgyn Mary christ's mother / and other images of saints ought to be
worshipped. For lo earthely kings and lords which use to send their letters
ensealid with their arms or with their preuy signet to men that are with them
/ are worshipped of these me^. For wha^ these me^ receive their lords letters in
which they se and know the wills and biddi^ges of their lords / in
worship of their lords they do of their cappes to these letters. Why not than
/ sins in images made with man's hand / we may read and know many diverse
things of god / and of his saints / shall we not worship their images?

And I said with my forsaid protestacyon. I say that these worldly vsages of
temporal lords that ye speak now of / may be done in case without sin /
but this is no similitude to worship images made by man's hand / syns yt
Moses / David / Solomon / Baruch / and other seyntes in the bible forbid so
pleynly ye worshipyng of all soche images.

Than the archbishop said to me. Lewd losell In the old law before that
christ took mankind was no likeness of any person of ye trinite another
showed to man nor known of man: but now syns christ became man / it is
lefull to have images to show his ma^hode. Ye though many me^ which are right
great clerks and other also held it an error to peynte ye trinite. I say it
is well done to make and to peynte the trinite in images. For it is great
moving of devotion to me^ to have and to behold the trinite and other images of
seyntes caruyd / cast / and peynted. For beyond the sea are the best
peynters that ever I saw. And syrs / I tell you this is their manner and it is a
good manner. When that an image maker shall kerue / cast in moulde / or peynte
any images / he shall go to a priest and shryue him as clean / as if he should
than dye and take penance / and make some certain vow of fasting or of
praiynge / or of pilgrimages doing / praiyng the priest / specially to pray
for him / that he may have grace to make a fair and a devout image.

And I said. Sir I doubt not / if these peynters that ye speak of or any other
peynters understood truly the text of Moses / of David / of the wise man / of
Baruch and of other seyntes and doctoures / these peynters should be moved to
shryue them to god with full inward sorrow of heart / taking upon them to do
right sharp penance for the sinful and vain craft of peyntinge / karuynge
or castinge that they had used / promising god feithfully never to do so after
/ knowleging openly before all me^ their reprouable earni^g. And also sir these
priests yt shriue (as ye do say) peinters and inioyne the^ to do penance /
and pray for their speed promysyng to them help of their prayers for to be
curious in their sinful crafts: sin herein more grievously tha^ the
peynters. For these priests do comfort and give them counsel to do that
thing / which of great pain / ye / under the pain of gods curse they
should utterly forbydde them. For cerris sir / if the wonderful werking of god
and the holy living and teaching off Christ and off his apostles and
prophets were made known to the people by holy living and true and besy
teaching of priests: these things (sir) were sufficient books and kalendares
to know god by and his saints without any images made with man's hond: but
certis the vicious living of priests and their covetousness are chief cause
of this error and all other viciousness that reigns among the people.

Than the archbishop said unto me. I hold yt a vicious priest and a curste /
and all the^ that are of thy sect: for all priests of holy church / and all
images that move men to devotion / thou and soche other go about to destroy.
Loosell / ware it a feire thing to come in to a church / and see therein none
image?

And I said. Sir they that come to the church for to pray devoutly to the
lord god may in their inward wits be ye more fervent / that all their
outward wits be closed fro all outward seeing and hearing and fro all
distroblau^ce and lettyngis. And syns Christ blessed them yt saw him not
bodily / and have believed feith fully in him: It suffices than to all men
through hearing and knowing of goddis word / and to do there after for to
believe in god / though they see never ymagis made with mannis hand after any
Person of the trinite or of any other seynte.

And the Archebisshop said to me with a fervent spyrite. I say to ye Losell /
that it is right well done to make and to have an image of the trinite Ye what
say thou? Is it not a stiering thing to behold soche an image?

And I said. Sir ye said right now that in ye old law or Christ took
mankind / no likeness of any person of the trinite was shewid to men:
wherefore sir ye said it was not tha^ lefull to have ymagis / but now ye say
syns Christ is becomen man / it is lefull to make and to have an image of the
trinite and also of other seyntis. But sir this thing would I learn of you.
Syns the father of heaven / ye and every person of the trinite was without
beginning god almighty / and many holy prophetis that were dedely men were
martiresed violently in the old law / and also many men and women than died
holy confessors Why was it not than as lefull and necessary as now to have
made an image of the father of heaven / and to have made and had other ymagis
of martires / prophetis / and holy co^fessours to have been kalendaris to advise
men and move them to devotion / as ye say that ymagis now do?

And ye Archebisshop said. The sinagoge of Iues had not authorite to approve
these thingis as ye church of Christ has now.

And I said. Sir seint Gregory / was a great man in ye new law / and of great
dignite / and as ye common law witnesses / he co^mendid greatly a bishop / in
yt he forbadde utterly ye ymagis made with mannis hand should be worshipid.

And ye Archebisshop said. Ungracious losell thou fauerist no more trewthe than
an hounde / Syns at ye roode at ye north door at London / at our lady at
walsingam and many other diverse placis in England ar many great and preisable
miracles done: should not the ymagis of soche holy seyntis and placis at ye
reverence of god and our lady and other seyntis be more worshippid than other
placis and ymagis where no soche miracles ar done?

And I said. Sir there is no soche virtue in any ymagery that any ymagis should
herefore be wors^hippid / wherefore I am certain yt there is no miracle done of
god in any place in earth because that any ymagis made with ma^nis hand should
be worshippid. And herefore sir as I preached openly at shrewisbery and other
placis I say now here before you / yt no body should trust that there war any
virtue in ymagery made with mannis hand / and herefor no body should vow to
them / nor seake them nor knele to them nor bow to them / nor pray to them /
nor offer any thing to them / nor kiss them / nor ensence them. For lo the
most worthy of soche ymagis / the brazen serpente by Moses made / at goddis
bidding. The good king Ezechie destroyed worthily and thankefully: for because
it was encensed. Therefore sir if men take good head to the writing and to the
lerning of saint Augustine of saint Gregory and of saint John Crisostome / and
of other seyntis and doctors how they speak and write of miracles that shall
be done now in ye last end of ye world: it is to dread yt for ye vnfeith
fullness of men and women the fend has great power for to work many of ye
miracles yt now ar done in soche placis. For both men and women delight now
more for to hear and know miracles / than they do to know goddis word or
to hear it effec^uously. Wherefore to ye great confusion of all the^ yt thus
do: Christ says. The gna^cio^ of aduolteres requires tokyns / miracles and
wonders. Never thelesse as diverse seyntis say / now when ye feithe of god is
publisshed in christendom / ye word of god suffices to ma^nis salvation
without soche miracles: and thus also ye word of god suffices to all
feithfull me^ and women without any soche ymagis / but good sir / syns ye
father of heaven yt is god in his godhed is ye most unknown thing yt may be
and ye most wonderful spyrit / having in it no shape or likeness of any
me^bres of oni dedely creature In what likeness or what image may god the
father be shewid or peintyd?

And the Archhebisshop said. As holy church has sufferid and yet sufferith
the ymagis of all the trinite and other ymagis to be peyntid and shewid /
suffices to them that are members of holy church But syns thou art a rotten
membre cut away from holy church thou fauerest not the ordinance thereof.
But syns the day passith / leave we this matter.

ANd than he said to me. What say thou to ye third point yt is certified
against the preching openly in shrewisbery that pilgrimage is not lefull. And
over this thou saidist / that those men and women that go on pilgrimagis to
Ca^turbery / to Beuerley / to karlington / to walsingame and to any soche other
placis ar acursed and made foolisch spending their goods in waste.

And I said / sir by this certificacion I am accused to you that I should
teach / that no pilgrimage is lefull. But I said never thus. For I know that
there be true pilgrimagis and lefull and full plesaunt to god / and therefore sir
how so ever mine enemies have certified you of me I told at shrewisbery of two
manner of pilgrimagis.

And the Archebisshop said to me / whom call thou true pilgrims?

And I said. Sir with my protestacio^ I call them true pilgremis trauelyng
toward ye bliss of heaven which in the state / degree / or order ye god calls
them / do besy them feithfully for to occupy all their wits bodily and
gostely to know trewly and to keape feithfully the biddinges of god / hatyng
and fleyng all the seven dedely sins and every branch of the^ reulyng them
verteuously (as it is said before) with all their wits / doing discretely
wilfully and gladly all the werkis of mercy bodily and gos^ely after their
connyng and power / ablyng them to the gifts of the holy ghost disposing them
to receive in their souls and to hold therein the right blessings of Christ
beseyng them to know and to keep the seuene principal virtues / and so tha^
they shall obtain here through grace for to use thankfully to god all the
conditions of charity / and than they shall be moouyd with the good spirit of
god for to examyne often and diligently their conscience / that another wilfully
nor wittingly they err in any article of believe / having continually (as
frailte will suffer) all their besinesse to dread and to flee the offense of
god / and to love over all thing and to seek ever to do his plesaunt will. Of
these pilgremis I said / what so ever good thought that they any time think:
what verteuous word that they speak: and what fruitful work that they
work: every soche thought / word and work is a step nou^bered of god
toward him into heuene. These for said pilgremis of god / delight sore when they
hear of seyntis or of verteuous men and women how they forsook wilfully the
prosperity of this life / how they withstode the suggestion of the fend / how
they restreined their fleschly lusts / how discrete they were in their penance
doing how pacient they were in all their aduersites / how prudent they were in
counseling of men and women moouyng them to hate all sin and to fly them /
and to shame ever greatly there of and to love all virtues and to draw to them
/ ymaginyng how Christ and his folowers by example of him / suffered skornis
and sclaunders / and how patiently they abode and took the wrongful manasyng
of tyrauntis / how homely they were and seruisable to poor men to relieve and
comfort them bodily and gostely after their power and connyng / and how deuote
they were in prayers / how fervent they were in heavenly desires / and how they
absented them fro spectacles of vein seyngis and hearingis / and how stable
they were to let and to destroy all vices / and how laborious and ioifull they
were to sow and to plant virtues. These heavenly conditions and soche other have
ye pilgremis / or endeuer the^ for to have: whose pilgrimagie god acceptith And
again I said / as their werkis show / the most part of men and women that
go now on pilgrimagis have not these forsaid conditions / nor loves to besy
them feithfully for to have For as I well know syns I have full often assaide /
examyne who so ever will twenty of these pilgremis: and he shall not find three
men or women yt know surely a co^maundme^t of god / nor can say their Pater
noster and Aue maria / nor their Credo redely in any manner of langage. And as I
have learnid and also know somewhat by experience of these same pilgremis rellyng
the cause / why that many men and women go hither and thither now on
pilgrimagis / it is more for the health of their bodies than of their souls /
more for to have richesse and prosperity of this world / than for to be
e^ryched with virtues in their souls / more to have here worldely and
fleschely friendship / than for to have friendship of god and of his seintis in
heaven. For what so ever thing man or woman does / the friendship of god nor of
any other saint ca^ not be had without keaping of goddis commaundeme^tis.
Forther with my protestacion I say now as I said in shrewisbery / though they
that have fleschely wills travel fer their bodies and spe^de mekill money to
seake and to visit the bonys or ymagis (as they say they do) of this seynte or
of yt: soche pilgrimage going is another praisable nor tha^kefull to god nor to
any seinte of god: syns in effect all soche pelgrimes despise god and all his
co^mau^dme^tis and seyntis. For ye co^mau^dme^tis of god they will another know
nor keape / nor conform the^ to live verteuosly by example of Christ and of
his seyntis. Wherefore sir I have prechid and taucht openly / and so I purpose
all my life time to do with gods help / sai^g yt soche fo^de people wast
blamefully gods goods in their vein pilgrimagis / spending their goods upon
vicious hostelars / which are often unclean women of their bodies: and at the least those goods with the which they should do werkis of mercy after goddis
bidding to poor nedy men and women. These poor mennis goods and their
lyuelode these runnars about offer to rich priestis / which have mekill more
lyuelode than they neade / And thus those goods they waste wilfully and spend
the^ unjustly against goddis bidding upon strangers / with which they should
help and releue after goddis will their poor nedy neighbors at home: ye and
over this folly / often times diverse men and women of these runners thus madly
hither and thither in to pilgrimage borowe hereto other mennis goods / ye and
some time they stele mennis goods hereto / and they pay them never agein. Also
sir I know well that when diverse men and women will go thus after their own
wills and fynding out one pilgrimage / they will orden with them before to
have with them both men and women that can well sing wanton songs / and some
other pilgremis will have with them bag pipes / so that every town that they
come throw what with the noise of their syngyng / and with the sound of their
piping / and with the Iangelyng of their Canterbery bellis / and with the
barkyng out of doggis after them that they make more noise than if ye king came
there away with all his clarions and many other menstrelles. And if these men
and women be a monethe out in their pilgrimage / many of the^ shall be an half
year after great iangelers / tale tellers and liars.

And the Archbishop said to me. Leude losell thou see not far enough in
this matter / for thou co^siderest not the great travel of pilgremys therefore
thou blamest that thing that is praisable. I say to yt that it is right well
done / that pilgremys have with them both syngers and also pipers that when
one of them that goes barfote strikes his too upon a stone and hurts him
sore / and makes him to blede: it is well done that he or his fellow begin than
a song / or else take out of his bosom a baggepype for to drive away with
soche myrthe the hurt of his fellow. For with soche salace the travel and
werinesse off pylgremes is lightely and merrily brought forth.

And I said. Sir saint Paul teaches men to weep with them yt weep.

And the archebishoppe said. What ianglist thou against me^nis deuocio^ / what
soever thou or soch other say / I say that the pilgrimage that now is used is
to the^ that do it / a praysable and a good mean to come the rather to grace.
But I hold the unable to know this grace: for thou enforsestthe to let ye
devotion of the people: syns by authorite of holy scripture men may lefully
have and use soche solace as thou reprouest. For David in his last psalm
teaches me to have diverse instruments of music for to praise there with god.

And I said. Sir by the sentence of diverse doctors expounding the psalms of
David / ye music and menstrelcy that David and other seyntes of the old law
spoke of / owe now another to be taken nor used by the letter / but these
instruments with their music ought to be interpreted gostely: for all those
figures are called virtues and grace / with which virtues men should please god
and praise his name. For saint Paul says. All soche things befell to them in
figure. Therefore sir I understand that the letter of this psalm of David /
and of soche other psalms and sentences does slay them that take the^ now
letterally. This sentence I understand sir Christ approves him self putting
out the menstrelles / or that he would quycken the dead damsel.

And ye archbishop said to me. Leude losell / is it not lefull to us to have
organes in ye church for to worship therewith all god? And I said

Ye sir by mannys ordinance / but by the ordinance of god a good sermonne to
the peoples understanding were mekill more plesaunt to god.

And the Archebisshoppe said / that organes and good delectable song
quyckened and sharpened more mennys wits than should any sermonne.

But I said. Sir lusty men and worldly lovers delight and coue^e and travel to
have all their wits quickened and sharpened with diverse sensible solace:
but all ye feithfull lovers and folowers of Christ have all their delight to
hear goddis word / and to understand it truly / and to work thereafter
faithfully and continually. For no doubt to dread to offend god / and to love
to please him in all thing quyckeneth and sharpeneth all the wits of christ's
chosen people: and ableth the^ so to grace / that they joy greatly to
withdraw their ears / and all their wits and members from all worldly
delight and from all fleschly solace. For saint Jerome (as I think) says. No
body may joy with this world and reign with Christ.

And the Archbishop (as if he had been displeased with mine answer) said to
his clerks. What guess ye this ydiote will speak there / where he has none
dread: syns he speaks thus now here in my presence? Well well / by god thou
shall be ordened for. And than he spoke to me all angerly.

WHat say thou to this forth point / yt is certified against the preching
openly and boldly in Shrewisbery / ye priests have no title to tithes.

And I said. Sir I named there no word of tithes in my preaching. But / more
tha^ a month after that I was arreasted / there in prysone a man came to me in
to the prysone asking me what I said of tithes. And I said to him. Sir in
this town are many clerks and priests of which some are called religious me^
though many of them be seculers. Therefore askeye off them this question. And
this man said to me. Sir our prelates say / that we are also obliged to pay
our tithes of all things that renew to us / and that they are acursed / yt
with draw any part wittingly fro them of their tithes. And I said (sir) to
that man / as with my protestacyon I say now here before you: that I had
wonder that any priest dare say / men to be acursed with out ground of goddis
word. And ye man said. Sir our priests say that they curse me^ thus by
authorite of gods law. And I said. Sir I know not where this sentence of
cursing is authorized now in the bible. And therefore sir I pray you that ye
will ask the most conni^g clerk of this town / that ye may know where this
sentence cursynge them that tithe not now is written in gods law: for if it
were written there I would right gladly be learned where. But shortly this man
would not go from me / to ask this question of a another body / but required me
there / as I would answer before god / if in this case the cursing of priests
were laufull and approved of god. And shortly herewith came to my mind the
learning of saint Peter / teachi^g priests specially to halow ye lord christ
in their hearts: being evermore redye (as far as in the^ is) to answer
through faith and hope to the^ yt ask of the^ a reason. And this lesson Peter
teaches me^ to use with a meke spyrite and with dread of ye lord. Wherefore
sir / I said to this man in this wise. In the old law which endyd not fully
till the time yt christ rose up ageyn fro death to life) god commanded tithes
to be given to the levites for the great business and daily travel that
pertayned to their office: But priests / because their travel was mekyll more
easy and light / tha^ was the office of the levites: god ordained that priests
should take for their lifelode to do their office / ye tenth part of tho
tithes that were given to the levites. But naw (I said) in the new law another
Christ nor any of his apostles took tithes of the people / nor commanded the
people to pay tithes another to priests / nor to deacons. But Christ taught
the people to do alms / that is works of mercy / to poor nedy me^ of
surpluse / that is superfluouse of their temporal goods which they had more
tha^ them nedid reasonably to their necessary lyuelode. And thus (I said) not
of tithes / but of pure alms of the people Christ lived and his apostles /
when they were so besyre in teaching off the word of god to the people that
they might not travel other wise for to get their lyuelode. But after
Christ's ascensyon / and when the apostles had received ye holy ghost / they
traueled with their hands for to get their lyuelode / when that they might
thus do for besye preaching. Therefore by example of himself saint Paul
teaches all the priests of Christ for to travel with their hand / when
for besye teaching of the people they might thus do. And thus all these
priests whose priestehode god accepts now / or will accept or did in the
apostles time / and after their discease: will do to the worlds end. But (as
Cisterciensis tells) in the thousand year of our lord Jesus Christ / two
hundredth and a leuenth year / one pope the tenth Gregory ordened new / tithes
first to be given to priests now in the new law. But saint Paul in his
time whose trace or example all priests of god enforce them to follow / seeing
the covetousness that was among the people desiring to destroy this foul
sin through the grace of god / and true virtuous living and example of
himself: wrette and taucht all priests for to follow him as he followed
Christ patiently / wyllyngly and gladly in hye pouerte. Wherefore Paul says
thus. The lord has ordened that they yt preach the gospel shall live of
the gospel. But we (says Paul) that covet and besy us to be feithfull
folowers of Christ / use not this power. For lo (as Paul witnesses
afterward) when he was full pore and nedy preaching among the people: he was
not chargeous unto them / but with his hands he traueled not only to get his
own living / but also ye living of other poor and nedy creatures. And syns
the people was never so couetouse nor so auarouse (I guess) as they ar now it
were good counsel / yt all priests took good head to this heavenly learning of
Paul / folowimg him here / in wilful pouerte / nothing charging the people
for their bodily lyuelode. But because ye many priests do contrary Paul in
this forsayde doctrine: Paul bids the people take heed to those priystes
that follow him as he had given them example. As / if Paul would say thus to ye
people. Accept ye none other priests than they that live after the form
that I have tauchte you. For certain in what soever dignite or order that any
priest is in / if he conform him not to follow Christ and his apostles in
wilful pouerte / and in other heavenly virtues / and specially in true
preaching of gods word: though soche a one be named a priest / yet he is
no more but a priest in name / for the work of a very priest soch a one
wants. This sentence approves Augusttne / Gregory / Chrysostom / and
Lincon^ plainly.

And ye archbishop said to me. Think thou this wholesome learning for to
sow openly or yet privily among ye people? Certain this doctrine co^trarieth
plainly ye ordinance of holy fathers which have ordened granted and licenced
priests to be in diverse degres / and to live by tithes and offringes of ye
people and by other deuties.

And I said. Sir / if priests were now in mesurable mesure and number / and
lived virtuously / and taucht besyly and truly the word of god by example of
Christ and of his apostles: withouten tithes / offerynges / and other duties
yt priests now challenge and take / y^ people would give the^ freely sufficient
lyuelode.

And a clerk said to me. How will thou make this good that ye people will give
freely to priests their lyuelode / syns yt now by ye law every priest ca^
scarcely co^strayne ye people to give the^ their lyuelode?

And I said. Sir it is now no wonder though the people grudge to give pristes
the lyuelode that they ask: for mekill people know now how that priests
should live / and how that they live contrary to Christ and to his apostles.
And therefore the people is full heavy to pay (as they do) their temporal
goods to persons and to other vicares and priests / which should be
feithfull dispensatours of the pareshes goods taking to themselfes no more but
a scarce lyui^g of tithes nor of offrynges by the ordinance of the common law.
For what soever priests take of the people: be it tithe or offering or any
other deutie or service: the priests ought not to have thereof no more but a
bare living / and to depart the residew to the poor men and women specially
of the parish / of whom they take this temporal living. But the most dele
of priests now wastes their pareshes goods and spends the^ at their own
will after the world in their vein lusts / so that in few places poor me^
have dewly (as they should have) their own sustenaunce / another of tithes nor
of offerynges / nor of other large wages and foundacions yt priests take of ye
people in diverse manners above it that they need for needful sustenaunce of
meat and clothinge. But ye poor nedy people ar forsaken and left of priestis
to be susteinyd of ye paroshenis / as if the priestis took nothing of ye
paroshenis / for to help ye poor people with. And thus sir into over great
chargis of the paroshenis they pay their te^porall goods twice / where ones
might suffice / if priestis were true dispensatours. Also sir the paroshenis
that pay their te^porall goods (be they tithes or offeringes) to priestis that
do not their office among them justly / ar parteners of every sin of those
priestis: because that they sustain those priestis folly in their sin with
their te^porall goods. If these things be well considerid what wonder is it
than sir / if the paroshenis grudge against these dispensatours?

Than the Archebisshop said to me. Thou y^ sholdeist be judged and reulyd by
holy church / presumptuously thou demest holy church to have erryd in the
ordinance of tyhes and other duties to be paid to pristis. Yt shall be long
or thou thryue Losell / that thou despicest thy gostely mother. How darist thou
speak this Losell among the people? Are not tithes geuyn to priestis for to
live by?

And I said. Sir saint Paul says that tithes were given in the old law
toleuytes and to priestis / that came of the lynage of Leui / But our priest he
says came not of the lynage of Leui / but of ye lynage of Judah: to which Judah
no tithes were promised to be geuyn. And therefore Paul says / syns the
priesthode is changed fro the generation of Leui to the generation of Judah /
it is necessary yt chaungyng also be made of ye law. So yt priestis live now
without tithes and other duties yt they now claim / following Christ and his
apostles in wilful pouerte / as they have given them example. For syns Christ
lived all ye time of his preaching by pure almose of the people / and by
example of him his apostles lived in ye same wise / or else by the travel of
their ha^dis / as it is said above Every priest whose priesthode Christ
approuyth knowith well / and confessith in word / and in work that a disciple
owith not to be above his master / but it suffices to a disciple to be as his
master / simple / and pure / meke and pacient: and by example specially of his
master Christ / every priest should reule him in all his living / and so
after his connyng and power a priest should besy him to enfourme and to reule
whom so ever he might charitably.

And the Archebisshop said to me with a great spirit Goddis curse have thou
and mine for this teaching: for thou woldist hereby make ye old law more fre
and perfect than the new law. For thou say that it is lefull to levites and
to priestis to take tithes in the old law / and so to enjoy their
priuelegies: but to us priestis in the new law thou say it is not lefull to
take tyhes. And thus thou geuist leuytes of the old law more fredome than to
priestis of the new law

And I said. Sir I meruell / that ye understand this plain text of Paul
thus. Ye wot well / that the levites and priests in the old law that took
tithes were not so fre nor so perfect as Christ and his apostles that took no
tithes And sir there is a doctor (I think yt it is saint Jerome) that says
thus. The priestis that challenge now in the new law tithes / say in effect /
that Christ is not becomen man / nor that he has yet suffered death for
mannis love. Wherefore this doctor says this sentence. Syns tithes were the
hyres and wagis limyted to levites and to priests of the old law for bearing
about of the tabernacle / and for fleayng and fleayng of beastis / and for
burning of sacrifice / and for keeping of the temple / and for tromping of
battle before the oste of Israel / and other diverse obseruauncis that
perteinyd to their office: those priestis that will challenge or take tithes:
deny that Christ is comen in flesh and do ye priestis office of the old
law for whom tithes were granted: for else (as this doctor says) priestis
take now tithes wrongfully.

And the Archebisshop said to his clerks. Herd ye ever losell speak thus?
Certain this is the learning of them all / yt where so ever they come / and they
may be suffered / they enforce them to expugne the fredome of holy church.

And I said. Sir why call you the taking of tithes and of soche other duties
that priests challenge now wrongfully the fredome of holy church: Syns another
Christ nor his apostles chalengid nor took soche duties. Herefore these
takyngis of priestis now are not called justly the fredome of holy church /
but all soche geuyng and taking ought to be called and holden the sclaunderous
covetousness of men of ye holy church.

And the Archebisshop said to me. Why Losell wilt not thou and other that are
confedered with the / seake out of holy scripture and of the sentence of
doctors all sharp authorites against lordis and knyghtis and squyeris and
against other seculer men / as thou doeste against priests?

And I said. Sir what so ever men or women lordis or ladies or any other that are present in our preaching specially or in our co^munyng after our connyng we
tell out to the^ their office and their charges: but sir syns Chrysostom says
yt priestis ar the stomach of ye people / it is needful in preaching and also
in communyng / to be most besy about this priesthode / syns by the viciousnes
of priestis both lordis and commons ar most synfully infected and led into
the worste. And because that ye covetousness of priestis / and pride and the
boste yt they have and make of their dignite and power / destroieth not only
the virtues of priesthode in priestis them self but also over this / it
stierith god to take great ve^geaunce both upon lordis and upon commons which
suffer these priests charitably

And the Archebisshop said to me. Thou iudgest every priest proud yt will not
go arrayed as thou doste. By god I deem him to be more meke that gothe every day
in a scarlet gown / than thou in ye threde bare blew gown. Whereby know
thou a proud man?

And I said. Sir a proud priest may be known when he denies to follow
Christ / and his apostles in wilful pouerte and other virtues and couerith
worldly worship / and takes it gladly / and gatherith to gither with pletyng
manasyng / or with flattering or with simony any worldly goodis: and most if a
priest besy him not chefely in himself and after in all other men and women
after his connyng and power to withstond sin.

And the Archebisshop said to me. Though thou knew a priest to have all
these vices / and though thou saw a priest lovely lie now by a woman knowing
her fleschly: would thou herfore deem this priest dampnable? I say to the
that in the tournyng about of thy hand soche a sinner may be verily repented.

And I said. Sir I will not da^pne any man for any sin that I know done or
may be done / so that the sinner leuyth his sin. But by authorite of holy
scripture / he that synneth thus openly as ye show here / is da^pnable for
doing of soche a sin / and most specially a priest that should be example
to all other for to hate and fly sin: and in how short time yt ever ye say
that soche a sinner may be repented: he owes not of him that knows his
synnyng to be judged verily repentaunt / without open evidence of great shame
and hearty sorrow for his sin. For who so ever and specially a priest that
uses pride / envy / covetousness / lechery / simony / or any other vices: and
shewith not as opyn evidence of repentance as he has given evil example and
occasion of synnyng / if he contynew in any soche sin as long as he may / it
is likely that sin leaves him / and he not sin / and as I understand
soche a one / synneth unto death / for whom no body owes to pray / as saint
John says

And a clerk said than to the Archebisshop. Sir the longer that ye appose him
/ the worse he is: and the more that ye besy you to amend him the waiwarder he
is: for he is of so shrewde a kind / that he shamyth not only to be himself a
foul neste: but without shame he besiech him to make his neste fouler.

And the Archebisshop said to his clerke^ Suffer a while / for I am at an end
with him for there is one other point certified against him / and I will hear
what he says thereto.

ANd so than he said to me. Lo it is here certified against the / that thou
preachidst openly at shrewisbery / that it is not lefull to swear in any case.

And I said. Sir I preachid never so openly / nor I have not tauchte in this
wise in any place. But sir as I preachid in shrewisbery / with my protestacion
I say to you now here: yt by the authorite of ye gospel and of saint James and
by witness of diverse seyntis and doctors I have preachid openly in one place
or other that it is not lefull in any case to swear by any creature. And over
this sir I have also preachid and tauchte by ye forsaid authorites yt no body
should swear in any case / if yt without oath in any wise he yt is charged to
swear might excuse him to the^ yt have power to compel him to swear in
lefull thing and laufull. But if a man may not excuse him without oath to the^
yt have power to compel him to swear / than he owght to swear only by god /
taking him only yt is sothefastnesse / for to witness the sothefastenesse.

Anb than a Clerk askid me / if it were not lefull to a subject at the bidding
of his prelate for to knele down and towche the holy gospel book and kiss
it sayng: So help me god and this holy dome / for he should after his connyng
and power do all thing that his prelate commands him. And I said to the^.
Sirs ye speak here full generally or largely What if a prelate commanded his
subject to do an unlawful thing / should he obey thereto?

And the Archebisshop said to me A subject ought not to suppose that his
prelate will bid him do an unlawful thing For a subject ought to think /
yt his prelate will bid him do nothing but yt / he will answer for before
god yt it is lefull: and tha^ though ye bidding of ye prelate be vnliefull / ye
subject has no parell to fulfill it syns that he thinks and judges that
what so ever thing his prelate bids him do / that it is lefull to him for
to do it.

And I said. Sir I trust not hereto. But to our first purpose / sir I tell
you yt I was onys in a gentill mannis house / and there war than two clerks
there. A master of divinity / and a man of law / which man of law was also
comuning in divinity. And among other things these me^ spoke of oaths / and the
man of law said. At ye bidding of his souereyn which had power to charge him
to swear / he would lay his hand upon a book and hear his charge / and if
his charge to his understanding were unlawful / he would hastily with draw his
hand from the book: and if he perceived his charge to be lefull he would
hold still his hand upon ye book taking there only god to witness / that
he would fulfill that lefull charge after his power. And the master of divinity
said than to him thus. Certain he that leyeth his hand upon a book in this
wise and makyth there a promise to do that thing that he is commanded / is
obliged there / by book oath than to fulfill his charge. For no doubt he that
charge him to lay his hand thus upon a book / towching the book and
swearing by it / and kyssing it / promisyng in this form to do this thing or
that / will say and witness that he that towcheth thus a book and kysseth it
has sworn upon that book: and all other men that see that man thus do / and
also all tho that hear hereof in the same wise will say and witness / that
this man has sworn upon a book / wherefore the master of divinity said. Yt
was not lefull another to give nor to take any soche charge upon a book / for
every book is nothing else but diverse creatures of which it is made of.
Therefore to swear upon a book is to swear by creatures / and this swearinge is
ever unlawful. This sentence witnesses Chrysostom plainly blaming them
greatly that bring forth a book for to swear upon / charginge clerks that
in no wise they constrayne any body to swear / whether they think a man to
swear true or false.

And the Archbishop and his clerks scorned me and blamyd me greatle for this
saying. And ye Archbishop manassed me with great punisshement and sharp /
except I left this opinion of swearinge.

And I said. Sir this is not mine opinion / but it is the opinion of christ
our savior / and of saint Iamis and of Chrysostom and other diverse seyntes
and doctors.

Than the Archebishope badde a clercke read this homely of Chrysostom which
homely this clerk held in his hand written in a roll / which roll the
Archebisshope caused to be taken fro my fellow at Canterbury: and so than this
clerk read this roll till he came to a clause / where Chrysostom says /
that it is sin to swear well.

And than a clerk Malueren (as I guess) said to ye archbishop. Sir I pray
you wete of hi^ how yt he vndersto^deth Chrysostom here / saing it to be sin
to swear well.

And so y^ Archebisshop asked me how I understood here Chrysostom.

And certain I was somewhat afraid to answer hereto. For I had not besyed me
to study about the sense thereof / but lifting up my mind to god I prayed him
of grace. And as fast as I thought how Christ said to his apostles / wha^ for
my name ye shall be brought before judges I shall give into your mouth wisdom
that your adversaries shall not against say: and trusting feithfully in the
word of god. I said. Sir I know well that many men and women have now swearing
so in custom / that they know not nor will not know that they do evil for to
swear as they do / but they think and say yt they do well for to swear as
they do / though they know well yt they swear untruly. For they say / they
may by their swearing (though it be false) void blame or temporal harm
which they should have if they swear not thus. And sir many me^ and women
maynteyne strongly that they swear well when that thing is sothe that they
swear for. Also full many men and women say now / that it is well done to
swear by creatures / wha^ they may not (as they say) otherwise be believed.
Annd also full many men and women now say that it is well done to swear by god
/ and by our lady / and by other seyntes for to have the^ in mind. But syns
all these sayings ar but excusations and sin / me thinks sir that his
sentence of Chrysostom may be alleged well ageinste all soch swerers /
witnessing that all these sin grievously / though they think themself for to
swear in this forsaid wise well. For it is evil done and great sin for to
swear trewthe when in any manner / a man may excuse hi^ with out oath.

And the archbishop said / that Chrysostom might be thus understand.

And than a clerk said to me. Will thou tarry my lord no longer / but submit
the here mekely to the ordinance of holy church and lay thine hand upon a
book touching the holy gospel of god / promising not only with thy mouth
but also with thine heart to stand to my lords ordinance?

And I said. Sir have I not told you here / how that I herd a master of
divinity say that in soche a case it is all one to touch a book / and to
swear by a book?

And ye archbishop said. There is no master of divinity in England so great /
that if he hold this opinion before me / but I shall punisshe him as I shall do
the / except thou swear as I shall charge the.

And I said. Sir is not Chrysostom an ententyfe doctor?

And the Archbishop said. Ye.

And I said. If Chrysostom proves him worthy great blame that brings
forth a book to swear upon / it must needs follow that he is more to blame
that swears on that book.

And the Archbishop said. If Chrysostom meant accordingly to the ordinance of
holy church we will accept him.

And than said a clerk to me. Is not the word of god and god himself
equipollent / that is / off one authorite? And I said. Ye.

Than he said to me. Why will thou not swear than by the gospel of god / yt is
gods word / syns it is all one to swear by ye word of god / and by god
himself.

And I said. Sir / syns I may not now other wise be believed but by swearynge I
perceive (as Augustine says) that it is not spedefull yt ye that should be my
brothern should not believe me: therefore I am ready by the word of god (as the
lord commanded me by his word) to swear.

Than the clerk said to me. Lay than thine hand upon ye book touching ye
holy gospel of god and take thy charge.

And I said. Sir I understand that the holy gospel of god may not be touched
with man's hand.

And the clerk said. I fonded / and that I said not trewthe.

And I asked this clerk whether it were more to read the gospel or to touch
ye gospel.

And he said / it was more to read ye gospel.

Than I said. Sir by authorite of saint Jerome the gospel is not the gospel
for reding of ye letter / but for ye believe that men have in ye word of god /
that it is the gospel that we believe / and not the letter yt we read: for
because the letter yt is touched with man's hand is not the gospel / but ye
sentence that is verily believed in ma^nis heart is ye gospel. For so saint
Jerome says The gospel that is the virtue of gods word is not in ye leauys
of ye book / but it is in ye root of reason. Another the gospel (he says) is
in ye writing above of the letters / but the gospel is in the marking of y^
sentence of scriptures. This sentence approves saint Paul saiynge thus. The
kingdom of god is not in word but in virtue. And David says. The voice of ye
lord that is his word is in virtue. And after david says. Through the word
of god / ye heuens were fourmed / and in the spirit of his mouth is all the
virtue of them. And I pray you sir / understand ye well how David says / that
in ye spirit of the mouth of ye lord is all the virtue of angels and of men?

And the clerk said to me. Thou would make us to fond with the. Say we not
ye the gospel is are written in ye mass book?

And I said. Sir though men use to say thus / yet it is imperfect speech. For
the principal part off a thing is properlye the hooll thynge^ For lo /
man's soul that may not now be seen here / nor touched with any sensible
thing is properly man. And all the virtue of a tree is in the root thereof
that may not be seen / for do away the root / and the tree is destroyed. And
sir as ye said to me right now / god and his word are of one authorite / and
sir seynte Jerome witnesses that Christ very god and very man is hid in the
letter of his law: thus also sir the gospel is hid in the letter. For sir
as it is full likely many diverse men and women here in the earth touched
Christ and saw him and knew his bodily person which another touched nor
saw nor knew gostely his god head: right thus sir many men now touch and see
/ and write and read the scriptures of goddis law / which another touch / see
nor read effecctuallye the gospel. For as the godhede of Christ that is the
virtue of god is known by the virtue through belefe / so is the gospel / yt is
Christ's word.

And a clerk said to me. These be full mystie matters and unsavory that thou
show here to us.

And I said. Sir / if ye that are masters know not plainly this sentence ye may
sore dread that the kingdom of heuene be taken fro you / as it was fro the
princes of priests and fro the elders of the jews.

And than a clercke (as I guess) Malueren said to me. Thou know not thine
equiuocacyons / for the kingdom of heuene has diverse vnderstondinges. What
call thou the kingdom of heuene in this sentence that thou show here?

And I said. Sir by good reason and sentence of doctors y^ realm of heuene is
called here ye understanding of gods word.

And a clerk said to me. From who^ think thou that this understanding is
taken away?

And I said. Sir by authorite of Christ him self the effectual
understanding of Christ's word is taken away from all them chefely / which
are great lettered men and presume to understand high things / and will be
holden wise men / and desire mastershippe and hye stare and dignite / but they
will not conform them to ye living and teaching of Christ and off his
apostles.

Tha^ the Archbishop said. Well / well / thou will judge thy souereyns. By god
the king does not his deutie / but he suffer the to be condemned.

And than a another clerk said to me. Why on friday that last was / counseldest
thou a man off my lords / that he should not shriue him to man but only to
god?

And with this askyng I was abashed / and than by and by I knew that I was
suttely betrayed of a man that came to me in presone on the friday before
comunynge with me in this matter of confession / and certain by his words (I
thought) that this man came than to me of full fervent and charitable will:
But now I know he came to tempte me and to accuse me (god forgive him if it
be his will). And with all mine heart when I had thought thus I said to this
clercke. Sir I pray you that ye would fetch this man hither / and all the
words as nere as I can repete them which that I spoke to him on fridaye in
the prison I will rehearse now here before you all and before him.

And (as I guess) the Archbishop said tha^ to me. They yt are now here suffyse
to repete them. How saidest thou to him?

And I said. Sir that man came and asked me of diverse things / and after his*
asking I answered him (as I understood) that good was: and as he showed to
me by his words / he was sorry of his living in court and right heavy for his
own vicious living / and also for the viciousness of other men and
specially of priests evil living: and herefore he said to me with a
soroufull heart) as I gessed) yt he purposed fully within short time for to
leave ye court / and besye him to know gods law / and to conform all his
life thereafter. And when he had said to me these wordis and mo other / which
I would recherse and he were present / he prayed me to hear his confession. And
I said to him sir / wherefore come ye to me to be confessed of me / ye wot well
that the Archebisshop puttith and holdith me here as one unworthy other to give
or to take any Sacrament of holy church. And he said to me. Brother I wot
well and so wot many mo other / that you and soche other ar wrongfully vexed /
and herefore I will common with you the more gladly. And I said to him. Certain
I wot well that many me^ of this court and specially the priestis of this
household would be full evil a paid both with you and with me if they wiste /
that ye were confessed of me And he said that he cared not therefore / for he
had full little affeccion in them: and (as me tought) he spoke these wordis and
many other of so good will and of so hye desire for to have known and done
the pleasant will of god. And I said than to him as with my fore said
protestacion I say to you now here. Sir I counsel you for to absente you from
all evil company and to draw you to them that love and besy the^ to know
and to keape the preceptis of god: and than the good spirit of god will move
you for to occupy besily all your wits in gathering to gither of all your
sins as far as ye can bethink you / shamynge greatly of them and sorowyng
heartily for them / ye sir the holy ghost will than put in your heart a good
will and a feruen^ desire for to take and to hold a good purpose to hate ever
and to fly (after your connyng and power) all occasion of sin / and so than
wisdom shall come to you from above / lightenyng with diverse beamis of grace
and of heavenly desire all your wits / enfourmyng you how ye shall trust
stedfastely in the mercy of the lord knoulegyng to him only all your vicious
living / praiyng to him ever deuoutely of charitable counsel and continuance /
hoping without doubt that if ye co^tynew thus besiyng you feith fully to know
and to keep his biddi^gis that he will (for he only may) forgive you all your
sins. And this man said than to me. Though god forgive men their sins / yet
it behoouyth men to be assoyled of priestis and to do the penance that they
enjoin them. And I said to him. Sir it is all one to assoyle men of their
sins / and to forgive men their sins: Wherefore syns it perteinyth only to
god to forgive sin / Yt suffisith in this case to counsel men and women for
to leave their sin / and to comfort the^ that besye them thus to do for to
hope stedfastely in the mercy of god. And ageynwarde / priestis owght to tell
sharply to customable sinners / that if they will not make an end of their
sin / but contynew in diverse sins while yt they may sin / all soche
deserve peyn without any e^de. And herefore priestis should ever besy them to
live well and holily and to reach the people besely and trewly the word of
god / shewi^g to all folk in open preaching and in preuy cou^selyng that the
lord god only forgeuyth sin. And therefore those priestis that take upon
the^ to assoyle men of their sins / blaspheme god: syns that it perteinyth
only to ye lord to assoyle men of all their sins. For no doubt A thousand
year after that Christ was man / no priest of Christ durst take upon him
to teach the people another privily nor a pertly / that they behoouyd nedis to
come to be assoilid of them / as priestis now do. But by authorite of Christis
word / priestis bound endured customable si^ners to everlasting peynes / which
in no time of their living would besy the^ feithfully to know ye biddinges of
god / nor to keape the^. And ageyn all they that would occupy all their wits
to hate and to fly all occasion of sin / dreding over all thing to offend
god / and loouyng for to please him continually / to these men and women /
priestis shewid how ye lord assoileth the^ of all their sins. And thus
Christ promised to conferme in heaven all ye bindi^g and loosyng / yt priestis
by authorite of his word bind me^ in sin yt ar endured therein / or loose
the^ out of sin here upon earth yt ar verily repe^tau^t. And this man heari^g
these wordis said / yt he might well i^ conscience consent to this sentence But
he said / is it not nedeful to ye lay people yt ca^ not thus do / to go shriue
the^ to priestis? and I said if a man feale himself so distrobled with any
si^ne yt he ca^ not by his own wit avoid this sin without counsel of
the^ yt ar herein wyser than he In soche a case ye counsel of a good priest
is full necessary. And if a good priest fail as they do now commonly / in
soche a case saint Augustine says that a man may lefully common and take
counsel of a verteuous seculer man. But certain that man or woman is over
laden and to bestely / which can not bring their own sins into their mind
/ besiyng them night and day for to hate and to for sake all their sins /
doing a sighe for them after their connyng and power. And sir full acordingly
to this sentence upon midlenton sunday two year (as I guess) now agone / I
hard a monk of Feuersam / that men called Moredo^ preach at Canterbury at
the cross within Christ church Abbey saying thus of confession. As through
the suggestion of the fend without counsel of any other body that of themself
many me^ and women can ymagine and find meanys and ways enough to come to
pride / to theft / to lechery / and to other diverse vices: In contrary wise
this monk said. Syns the lord god is more ready to forgive sin than the
fend is or may be of power to move any body to sin / than who so ever will
shame and sorrow heartily for their sins / knouleging them feithfully to god /
amending them after their power and connyng / without counsel of any other
body than of god and himself through the grace of god all soche men and women
may find sufficient meanys to come to goddis mercy / and so to be clean
assoilid of all their sins. This sentence I said sir to this man of yours and
the self wordis as nere as I can guess.

And the Archebisshop said. Holy church approuyth not this learning.

And I said. Sir holy church of which Christ is head in heuene and in earth
must nedys approve this sentence. For lo hereby all men and women may / if they
will / be sufficiently tauchte to know and to keep the commaundementis of god /
and to hate and to fly centinewally all occasion of sin / and to love and
to seek virtues besely / and to believe in god stabely / and to trust in his
mercy steadfastly / and so to come to perfect charity and contynew therein
perseuerancly. And more the lord askith not of any man he renow in this life
And certain syns Jesus Christ dyed upon the cross wilfully to make men fre /
men of the church ar to bold and to besy to make men thrall / byndyng them
under the pain of endelesse curse (as they say) to do many obseruances and
ordinau^cis / which another the living nor teaching of Christ nor of his
apostles approves.

And a clerk said than to me. Thou shewist plainly here thy disceite which
thou haste learnyd of the^ that travel to sow popill among wheat. But I
counsel the to go away clean from this learning / and submyt the lowly to my
lord / and thou shall find him yet to be gracious tothe.

And as fast than a another clerk said to me How wast thou so bold at Paulis
cross in london to sto^de there hard with thy tippet bounden about thine
hedde and to repreue in his sermonne the worthy clerk Alkerton drawyng away
all yt thou myghtist / ye and ye same day at after none thou metyng yt worthy
doctor in Watlyng street callidst him salfe flaterer and ypocrite

And I said. Sir I thynk certainly that there was no man nor wooman that hated
verily sin and loouyd virtues / hearing the sermonne of the clerk of Oxforde
/ and also Alkertons sermonne / but they said or might justly say / yt
Alkerton reproouyd the clerk untruely / and sclaundered him wrongfully and
uncharitably. For no doubt if the living and teaching of Christ chefely and of
his apostl^es be true / no body that loouyth god and his law will blame any
sentence that the clerk than preachid there / syns by authorite of goddis
word and by approved seyntis and doctors and by open reason this clerk
approved all thingis clerly that he preached there.

And a clerk of the Archebishops said to me. His sermonne was false and yt he
shewith openly syns he dare not stand forth and defend his preaching that
hethan preached there.

And I said. Sir I think that he purposith to stand stedfastely thereby / or
else he sclau^dereth foully him self and also many other that have great trust
/ that he will stand by the trewith of the gospel. For I wot well his
sermonne is written both in latyne and in Englysch / and many men have it /
and they set great pryse thereby. And sir if ye were present with the
Archebisshop at lambeth when this clerk apered and was at his answer before y^
Archebisshop ye wot well that this clerk denied not there his sermonne / but
two days he maynteinyd it before the Archebisshop and his clerkis.

And than the Archebisshop or one of his clerkis said / I wot not which of
the^. That harlot shall be met with for that sermonne. For no man but he and
thou and soche other false harlotis praisith any soche preaching.

And than the Archebisshop said. Your cursed sec^e is besy / and it ioiethe
right greatly to contrary and to destroy ye privilege and fredome of holy
church. And I said. Sir I know no men that travel so besely as this sect
does (which you repreue) to make rest and peace in holy church. For pride
covetousness and simony which distrooble most holy church this sect hatith
and fliethe and trauellith besely to move all other me^ in like manner unto
meaknesse and wilful pouerte and charity / and fre ministryng of ye
sacrame^tis: this sect louyth and uses and is full besy to move all other
folk is thus to do. For these virtues owe all me^bres of holy church to their
hedde Christ

Than a clerk said to ye Archebisshop. Sir it is far days and ye have far
to ride to night / therefore make an end with hi^ / for he will none make. But
ye more sir yt ye besy you for to draw him toward you / the more contumax he
is made and the ferder fro you.

And than Malueren said to me. William knele down and pray my lord of grace
/ and leave all thy fantasies and become a child of holy church.

And I said. Sir I have prayed the Archebisshop often and yet I pray him for the
love of Christ that he will leave his indignacion that he has against me /
and that he will suffer me after my connyng and power for to do mine office of
priesthode / as I am chargid of god to do it. For I couete naught else but to
serve my god to his pleasing in the state yt I stand in and have taken me to.

And the Archebisshop said to me. If of good heart thou will submyt the now
here mekely to be reulid fro this time forth by my counsel / obeiyng mekely
and wilfully to mine ordinance / thou shall find it most profitable and
best to the for to do thus. Therefore tarry thou me no longer / grant to do
this that I have said to the now here shortly / or deny it utterly.

And I said to the Archebisshop. Sir owe we to believe that Jesus Christ was and
is very god and very man?

And the Archebisshop said. Ye.

And I said. Sir owe we to believe / that all Christis living and his teaching
is true in every point. And he said. Ye.

And I said. Sir owe we to believe / that the living of ye apostles and the
teaching of Christ and of all the proph^etes are true which are written in the
bible for the health and salvation of gods people? And he said. Ye.

And I said. Sir owe all christen men and women after their connyng and power
for to conform all their living to the teaching specially of Christ / and
also to the teaching and living of his apostles and of prophets in all
things that are plesaunt to god and edificacion to his church? And he said.
Ye.

And I said. Sir ought ye doctrine / ye bidding or ye counsel of any body to
be accepted or obeid unto / except this doctrine / these biddinges or this
counsel may be granted and affermed by christ's living and his teachinge
specially / or by the living and teaching of his apostles and prophets?

And ye Archbishop said to me. Other doctrine ought not to be accepted / nor
we owe not to obey to any man's bidding or counsel / except we ca^ perceive
yt this bidding or counsel acordeth with ye bidding and teaching of christ and
of his apostles and prophets.

And I said. Sir is not all the learning and biddinges and counsellis of holy
church means and healfull remedies to know and to with stond the preuy
suggestions / and the aperte te^ptacions of the fend: and also ways and
healfull remedies to slay pride and all other dedely sins and the branches
of the^ / and souereyn means to purchese grace / for to withstonde and
overcome all the fleschly lusts and mouynges?

And the Archbishop said. Ye.

And I said. Sir what soever thing ye or any other body bid or counsel me to
do / accordi^gly to this forsaid learning / after my conning and power through
ye help of god I will mekely with all mine heart obey thereto.

And the Archbishop said to me. Submitt the than now here mekely and wilfully
to the ordinance of holy church / which I shall show to the.

And I said. Sir accordingly as I have here now before you rehearsed I will now
be ready to obey full gladly to Christ the head off all holy church / and to
the learning and biddynges and counselles off every pleasynge membre of him.

Than the archbishop striking with his hand ferselye upon a cupborde spoke to
me with a great spyrite sayng. By Jesus but if thou leave soche addicions
obliging the now here without any excepcion to mine ordinance / or yt I go out
of this place I shall make the as sure as any thief that is in ye prison of
Lantern. Advise ye now what thou will do. And tha^ as if he had been angered
he went fro the cupborde where he stood to a wyndowe.

And than Malueren and a another clerk came nerer me / and they spoke to me
many words full plesantly / and a another while they manased me / and
counseled full besily to submyt me or else they said. I should not escape
ponishing over mesure / for they said I should be degraded / cursed and burned
/ and so than dampened But now they said thou maiste eschew all these mischeues
/ if thou will submyt the wilfully and mekely to this worthy prelate that has
cure of they soul. And for the pytie of Christ (said they) bethink the /
how great clerckes the bishop of Lincoln^ / Herforde / and Purney / were and
yet ar / and also. B. that is a well understanding man / which also have
forsaken and revoked all the learning and opinions / that thou and soche other
hold. Wherefore syns each of them is mekell wyser than thou art / we counsel
the for the best / that by the example off these four clerckes thou follow
them / submyttynge the as they did.

And one of the bishopes clerks said tha^ there / that he herd Nicoll
Herforde say / that syns he forsook and revoked all the learning and Lolardes
opinions / he has had mekell greater favor and more delight to hold against
them / tha^ ever he had to hold with them while he held with them.

And therefore Maluere^ said to me. I understand and thou will take yt to a
priest / and shryne the clean / forsake all soch opinions / and take thy
penance of my lord here / for the holding and teaching of the^ / with in
short time thou shall be greatly conforted in this doing.

And I said to the clerckes that thus besyly counseled me to follow these
forsaide men. Sirs if these men of whom ye counsel me to take example / had
forsaken benefyces of temporal profit / and of worldly worship / so that
they had absented them and eschewed from all occasyons off covetousness and
of fleschely lusts / and had taken them to simple living / and wilful
pouerte / they had herein given good example to me and to many other to have
followed them. But now syne all these four men have slanderously and shamefully
done the contrary / consentyng to receive and to have and to hold temporal
benefyces / living now more worldly and more fleschely than they did before
conformyng them to the manners off this world: I forsake them herein / and in
all their forsaid slanderous doing. For I purpose with the help of god in re
remission of all my sins and of my foul cursed living to hate and to fly
privily and apertly to follow these me^ / teaching and counsellyng whom soever
that I may for to fly and eschew the way that they have chosen to go in /
which will led them to the worste end / if in convenient time they repent
them not / verily forsakynge and reuokynge openly the slander that they have
put and every day yet put to Christ's church. For certain so open blasphemye
and slander as they have spoken and done in their reuokynge and forsakyng of
the trewthe ought not / nor may not privily be amended dewly. Wherefore sirs I
pray you that ye be sye you not for to move me to follow these men in
reuokynge and forsakynge of the trewthe and sothefasienesse as they have done
and yet do / wherein by open euydence they steire god to great wroth / and
not only against them self but also a geynste all them that favor them or
consent to them herein / or that comeneth with them / except it be for their
amendment. For where as these men first were persued of enemies / now they
have obliged them by oath for to slander and pursue Christ in his members
Wherefore as I trust stedfastely in the goodness of god / the worldly
covetousness / and the lusty living / and the slyding fro the treuth of these
runagates shall be to me and to many other men and women an example and an
evidence to stondethe more stiffly by the trewith of Christ

For certain / right many men and women do mark and abhor the foulness and
cowardnesse of these forsaide untrue men / how that they are overcome and
stopped with benefyces and withdrawn fro the trewith off gods word /
forsaking utterly to suffer therefore bodily persecucyon. For by this
vnfeithfull doing and apostosie of them specially that are great lettered men /
and have knowleged openly the treuth and now other for pleasure or displeasure
of tyrants have taken hyer and temporal wages to forsake the trewthe and to
hold against it / slaundering and persewing them that couete to follow Christ
in the way of righteousness / many men and women therefore are now moved. But
many mo through ye grace of god shall be moved hereby for to learn ye treuth of
god / and to do thereafter and to stond boldly thereby.

Than the Archebisshoppe said to his clerks. Besy you no longer about him /
for he and other soche as he is are confedered so to gither that they will not
swear to be obedient / and to submytte them to prelates of holy church. For
now syns I stood here / his fellow sent men word that he will not swear /
and that he counseled him that he should not swear to me. And losell in that
thing that in the is / thou haste besyed the to loose this young man / but
blessed be god / thou shall not have thy purpose of him. For he has forsaken
all thy learning / submyttynge him to be buxum and obedient to the ordinance
of holy church / and wepeth full bitterly / and curses the full heartily for
the venomous teaching which thou haste showed to him / counsellynge him to
do thereafter. And for thy false councellynge of many other and him thou haste
great cause to be right sorry. For long time thou haste besyed the to peruerte
whom soever thou might Therefore as many deaths thou art worthy of as thou
have given evil councelles. And therefore by Jesus thou shall go thither / where
Nicoll Harforde and tom Puruay were herbered And I undertake / or this day
eyghte days thou shall be right glad for to do wha^ thing that ever I
bydde the do. And losell I shall assaye if I can make yt there as soroufull
(as it was told me) thou waste glad of my last going out of England. By
saint Thomas I shall turn thy joy into sorrow.

And I said. Sir / there can no body preue laufully that I ioyed ever of the
manner of your going out of this land. But sir to say the sothe I was
joyful when ye were gone / for the bishop of London in whose prison ye left
me / found in me no cause for to hold me longer in his prison / but at the
request of my friends he delivered me to them asking of me no manner of
submittyng.

Than the archebishoppe said to me. Wherefore that I yede out of England is
unknown to the: But be this thing well known to the / that god (as I wot
well) has called me again and brought me into this land for to destroyethe
and the false sect that thou art off / as by god I shall pursue you so
naroulye / that I shall not leave a step off you in this land.

And I said to the archebisshop. Sir the holy prophet Jeremy said to the false
prophet Anany. When the word that is the prophecye of a prophet is known or
fulfilled / than it shall be known that the Lord sent the prophet in treutthe

And the Archebishoppe as if he had no^ ben pleased with my saiynge turned
him away ward hither and thither / and said. By god I shall set upon thy
shynnes a pair of perlis that thou shall be glad to change thy voice.

These and many mo wo^derous and co^vicious words were spoken to me manassing me
and all other of the same sect for to be punisshed and destroyed unto the
vttermoste.

And the Archbishop called than to him a clerk / and rowned with him / and
that clerk went forth and sone he brought in the Constable of Saltwode
castle / and ye archbishop rowned a good while with him / and than the
Constable went forth / and than came in diverse seculers / and they scorned me
no every side / and manassed me greatly. And some counseled the Archebisshop
to burn me by and by / and some other counseled him to drounde me in the sea
/ for it is nerehande there.

And a clerk standing be side me there knelede down to the Archebishoppe
praiyng him that he would deliver me to him for to say matenes with him / and
he would undertake that within three days I should not resist any thing that
were commanded me to do of my prelate.

And the archbishop said / that he would ordeine for me himself.

And than after came in ageyn ye Constable and spoke privily to ye archbishop.

And than the Archebisshop commanded the constable to lead me forth thens
with him and so he did. And when we were gone forth thens / we were sent af^^r
ageyn. And when I came in again before the Archebisshop / a clerk badde me
knele down and ask grace / and submit me lowly / and I should find it for
the best.

And I said than to the Archebisshop. Sir as I have said to you diverse times
to day / I will wilfully and lowly obey and submit me to be ordenid ever after
my connyng and power to god and to his law / and to every member of holy
church / as far forth as I can perceive that these me^bres accord with their
hedde Christ and will teach me / reule me / or chastyse me by authorite
specially of goddis law.

And the Archebisshop said. I wiste well he would not without soche addicions
submit him

And than I was rebukyd / scornyd and manasyd on every side / and yet after
this diverse persons cried upon me to knele down and submit me / but I stood
still and spoke no word. And than there was spokyn of me and to me many great
wordis / and I stood and herd them manase / curse and scorn me: but I said
nothing

Than a while after the Archedisshop said to me. Will thou not submit the to
the ordinance of holy church?

And I said. Sir I will full gladly submit me / as I have shewid you before.

And than the Archebisshop badde the Constable to have me forth thens in haste.

And so than I was led forth / and brought in to a foul unhonest prison /
where I came never before. But thanked be god / when all me^ were gone for^he
than fro me / and had sparred fast the prison door after them: by and by after
I therein by myself besied me to think on god / and to thank him of his
goodness. And I was than greatly comforted in all my wits / not only for
that I was than delivered for a time fro the sight / fro the hearing / fro the
presence / fro the scornyng and fro the manasyng of mine enemies: but much
more I reioysed in the lord because that through his grace he kept me so both
among the flatering specially and among the manasyng of mine adversaries / yt
without heaviness and anguysshe of my conscience I passed away fro them For as
a tree laid upon a another tree over whar^e or on cross wise / so was the
Archebisshop and his three clerkis always contrary to me / and I to them.

Now good god for thine holy name / and to the praisyng of thy most blessed
name / make us one to gither / if it be thy will by authorite of thy word /
that is true perfect charity / and else not. And that is may thus be / all that
this writing read or hear pray heartily to ye lord god that he for his
great goodness that can not be with tongue expressed / grant to us and to
all other / that in the same wise / and for the same cause specially or for any
other cause be at distaunce / to be knette and made one in true feith / in
steadfast hope / and in perfect charity. Amen.

Thus ends the examynacion of Master Wyllyam Thorpe. And here after follows
his testamente.
Matthew an apostle of Christ and is gospeler witnessith truly in the holy
gospel the most holy living and the most wholesome teaching of christ. He
rehersith how that Christ likeneth them that hear his wordis and keep them /
to a wise man that bildeth his house upon a stone / that is a stable and a
sad ground. This house is mannis soul in whom Christ deliteth to dwell /
if it be grounded that is stablisshed feithfully in his living and in his true
teaching / adourned or made fair with diverse virtues / which Christ used and
taucht without any medlyng of any error / as ar chefely the conditions of
charity. This forsaid stone is Christ upon which every feithfull soul must be
bylded / syns upon none other ground than upon Christis living and his
teaching no body may make any byldyng or housyng / where in Christ will come
and dwell This sentence witnesses saint Paul to the corinthians showing to
them that no body may set any other ground than is set / yt is Christis
living and his teaching. And because yt all men and women should give all their
business here in this life to bylde them virtuously upon this sure foundation:
saint Paul knouleging the fervent desire and the good will of the people of
Ephesy wrote to them co^fortably sayng: Now ye are not straungeris / gestis /
nor yet comelingis but ye ar the citezyns and of the household of god / byldyd
above upon the foundament of the apostles and prophetis. In which foundame^t
every byldyng that is byldyd or made through the grace of god / it increases or
growith into an holy temple* that is / every body / that is grounded or bylded
feithfully in the teaching and living of Christ is there through made the holy
temple of god. This is the stable ground and steadfast stone Christ / which
is the sure corner stone fast ioynyng and holdyng myghtely to gither two
wallis. For through Christ Jesus mean or middill person of the trinite / the
father of heaven is pituous or mercifully ioynyd and made one to gither to
mankind. And through dread to offend god / and fervent love to please him /
men be unseparably made one to god and defended surely under his proteccion.
Also this forsaid stone Christ was figured by the square stones of which the
temple of god was made. For as a square stone / where so ever it is cast or
laid / it abides and lies stabely: so Christ and every feithfull member of
his church by example of him abides and dwellith stabely in true faith / and
in all other heavenly virtues in all aduersites that they suffer in this valley
of tearis. For lo / when these forsaid square stones were hewn and wroughte for
to be laid in the wallis or pillars of goddis temple none noise or stroke of
the work men was hard. Certain this silence in workyng of this stone figureth
Christ chefely and his feithfull me^bres / which by example of him have been
and yet ar / and ever to the worldis end shall be so meke and paci^t in every
aduersite that no sound nor yet any grudging shall any time be perceived in
them Nevertheless this chief and most worshipful corner stone which only is
ground of all virtues proud beggars repreuyd: but this despite and reprefe
Christ sufferid most mekely in his own person for to give example of all
meekness and patience to all his feithfull folowers. Certain this world is
now so full of proud beggars which are named priestis: but the very office of
workyng of priesthode / which Christ approuyth true and acceptith / is far
fro the multitude of priestis that now reign in this world. For fro the highest
priest to the lowest / all (as who say) study / that is they ymagine and
travel besely / how they may please this world and their flessch. This
sentence and many soch other depends upon them if it be well considered /
other god the father of heaven has deceiuyd all mankind by the living
specially and teaching of Jesus Christ / and by the living and teaching of his
apostles and prophetis: or else all the popys yt have been / syns I had any
knowledge or discretion / with all the college of Cardinallis Archebishopis and
bisshopis / Monkys chanons and friars with all the contagious flock of the
comunaltie of priesthode which have all my life time and mekell longer reigned
and yet reign and increase dampnably fro sin into sin / have been and yet
be proud / obstinate heretics / covetous symoners and defoulyd aduulterers in
ye ministri^g of the sacramentis / and specially in ministryng of the sacrament
of the altar. For as their workys show whereto Christ bids us take heed /
the highest priestis and prelatis of this priesthode challenge and occupy
vnlefully temporal lordeshippes. And for temporal favor and mede they sell
and give benefices to unworthy and unable persons / yethes symoners sell sin
sufferyng men and women in every degree and estate to lie and co^tinew fro year
to year in diverse vices sclau^derously. And thus by evil example of hye
priestis in the church / lower priestis under them or not only suffered / but
they are maynteined to sell full dear to ye people for te^porall mede all ye
sacrame^tis. And thus all this forsaid priesthode is blown so hye and borne up
in pride and vayn glory of their estate and dignite / and so blindid with
worldly covetousness yt they disdeyne to follow Christ in very meekness and
wilful pouerte living holily / and preaching goddis word treuly freely and
co^tineually / taking their lyuelode at the fre will of ye people of their pure
almose / where and when they suffyse not for their true and besy preaching to
get their sustenau^ce with their ha^dis. To this true sentence grounded on
Christis own living and teaching of his apostles / these for said worldly and
fleschly priestis will not consent effectually. But as their werkys and also
their wordis show / boldeli and unshamefastly these for said named priestis and
prelatis couett / and enforse the^ mightily and besely y^ all holy scripture
were expou^did and drawn accordingly to their manners and to their vngrou^did
vsagis and fyndyngis. For they will not (syns they hold it but folly and
madness) comforme their manners to the pure and simple living of Christ and
his apostles / nor they will not follow freely their learning. Wherefore all the
emperors and kings / and all other lordis and ladies / and all the common
people in every degree and state / which have before time known or might have
known / and also all they that now yet know or might know this forsaid
witness of priesthode / and would not nor yet will enforce them after their
connyng and power to withstonde charitably the forsaid enemies and traitors of
Christ and of his church all these strive with Antechriste against Jesus And
they shall bear the indignacio^ of god almighty withouten end / if in
convenient time they amend them not / and repent them verily doing therefore
dew moornyng and sorrow after their connyng and power. For through
presumptuousnes and necligence of priestis and prelatis (not of the church of
Christ / but occupiyng their prelacy vndewly in the church and also by
flateryng and false covetousness of other diverse named priestis) lousengers and
lounderers ar wrongful made and named heremites / and have leave to defraude
poor and nedy creatures of their lyuelode / and to live by their false winnyng
and begging in slouthe and in other diverse vices. And also of these prelates
these cokir noses ar suffered to live in pride and hypocresy / and to defoull
themself both bodily and gostely. Also by the sufferyng and counsel of these
forsaid prelatis and of other priestis / ar made vain both brotherhodis and
susterhodis full of pride and envy / which are full contrary to the
brotherhode of Christ / syns they are cause of mekill dissension / and they
multiply and sustain it uncharitably: for in lusty eating and drinkyng
immeasurably and out of time they exercise themself. Also this vain
confederacye of brotherhodis / is permitted to be of one clothyng and to hold
to gither. And in all these ungrounded and unlawful doings / priestis ar
parteners and and great meddelers and counselors And over this viciousnes /
heremitis and pardoners / ankers and strange beggars ar licensed and admitted
of prelatis and priestis for to begyle the people with flateringis and
leasingis sclaunderously against all good reason and true believe / and so to
increase diverse vices in themself and also among all them that accept them or
co^sente to them. And thus the viciousnes of these forsaid named priestis and
prelatis have been long time / and yet is / and shall be cause of wars both
within ye realm and without And in the same wise these unable priests have
been / and yet are / and shall be chief cause of pestilence of men / and moren
of beestes / and of bareness of the earth / and of all other mischefes / to
the time ye lords and commons able them through grace for to know and to keep
the commandments of god / enforsyng them than feithfully and charitably by
one assente for to redress and make one this forsaid priesthode to the wilful
/ pore / meke / and innocent living and teaching specially of Christ and his
apostles. Therefore all they that know or might know the viciousnes that
reigns now cursedly in these priests and in their learning / if they suffyse
not to vndstond this contagious viciousnes: let them pray to the lord heartily
for the health of his church / absteyning the^ prudently fro these endured
enemies of Christ and of his people / and from all their sacraments / syns
to the^ all that know them or may know they are but fleschly deades and
false: as saint Cipriane witnesses in the first question of decrees / and in
the first cause. Ca. Si quis inquit. For as this seynte and great doctors
witness there / that not only vicious priests. but also all they that
favor the^ or consent to them in their viciousnes shall to gither perisshe
with them if they amend them not dewly: as all they perished that consented to
Satan and Abijron. For no thing were more co^fusyon to these forsaide vicious
priests / than to eschew them prudently in all their unlawful sacraments /
while they continue in their sinful living slanderously / as they have long
time done and yet do. And no dody need to be afraid (though death did follow by
one wise or other) for to dye out of this world without taking of any
sacrament of these forsaid christ's enemies / syns christ will not fail for
to ministre him self all lefull and healfull sacraments and necessary at all
time / and specially at the end / to all them that are in true feyth / in
steadfast hope / and in perfyte charity. But yet some mad foolis say for to
eschew slander / they will be shriue^ ones in the year and comuned of their
proper priests / though they know them defouled with slanderous vices. No
doubt but all they that thus do or consent privily or apertly to soch doing
ar culpable of great sin / syns saint Paul witnesses that not only they that
do evil are worthy of death and dampnacion: but also they that co^sente to
evil doars. Also (as their slaunderouse works witness) these forsaid vicious
priests despyce and cast from them heavenly connyng that is given of the holy
ghost. Wherefore the lord throws all soche despisers from him that they use
nor do any priesthode to him. No doubt than all they that wittingly or wilfully
take or consent yt any other body should take / any sacrament of any soche
named priest / synneth openly and da^pnably against all the trinite and ar
unable to any sacrament of health. And that this forsayde sentence is all to
gither true / into remission of all my sinful living trustinge steadfastly in
the mercy of god I offer to him my soul. And to prove also this forsaid
sentence true with the help of god I purpose fully for to suffer mekely and
gladly my most wretched body to be tormented / where god will / and of whom
he will / how he will / and when he will / and as long as he will / and what
temporal pain he will and death / to the praising of his name and to the
edificacion of his church. And I that am most unworthy and wretched cay^yf
shall now through the special grace of god make to him plesaunte sacrifice with
my most sinful and unworthy body. I beseech hartly all folk that read or
hear this end of my purposed testament / that through the grace of god they
dispose verily and virtuously all their wits / and able in like manner all
their members for to understand truly and to keep feythfully charitably and
continually all the commandments of god / and so than to pray devoutly to
all the blessed trinyte / that I may have grace with wisdom and prudence
from above / to end my life here in this forsaid truethe and for this cause /
in true feith and steadfast hope and in perfect charity. AMEN.

HEre ends sir William Thorpis testament on the friday after the rode day
and the twentye day of September / In the year of our lord a thousand four
hundred and sixty. And on the sunday next after the feste of saint Peter that
we call Lammesse day in the year of our lord a thousand / four hundrth and
seven / the said sir William was accused of these points before written in this
book before Thomas of Arundell Archebishoppe of Canterbury as it is said
before. And so was it than betwixt the day of his accusing and the day that
this was written three and fiftye year and as mekill more as fro the Lammesse
to the wodemesse. Behold the end.
The strengeth of every tale is in the end.
Here folowethe the Examinacion of the Lord Cobham.
The believe of the Lord Cobh^am.
BE it known to all men that in ye year of our Lord a thousand four
hundred and thirtene / in ye first year of the reign of king Henry the
fifte. The king gave to the bishop of Canterbury leave to correct the lord
Cabham. And because no man durst somone him personally / the archebisshoppe
set up a citacion on his cathedral church door on the wennisday next before
the natiuite of our lady in the forsaid year / and that citacion was taken
down by the friends of the lord Cobham: and after that the bisshope set up a
another on our lady day which also was rent down / and because he came not to
answer on the day assigned in the citacion the bishop cursed him for
contumacye. And the lord Cobham seeing all this malice purposed against hi^ /
wrote this believe that follows with his own hand and noted it him self: and
also answered to four points put against him by the bishop / and he went to
the king supposing to get of him good favor and lordship.

The believe.
I Believe in god the father almightye / maker of heaven and of earth / and in
Jesus Christ his only son our lord / which was conceived of the holy ghost
/ borne of the virgyn Marie / and suffered death under Ponce Pilate / crucified
/ deed and buried. He went down to helles: the third day he rose ageyn fro
death: he ascended up in to heuenis he sits on the right hand of god the
father almighty: fro thence he is to come to judge the quick and deed. I
believe in the holy ghost: all holy church: the comunyon of seyntes:
forgiveness of sins / vprisyng of flesche / and everlasting life. Amen.

And for to declare more plainly my sothfastnes in the believe of holy church.
I believe seithfully and verily that there is but one god almighty / and in
this godhede and of this godhede ben three persons: the father / the son /
and the holy ghost / and these three persons be the same god almighty.
Forthermore I believe that the second person of this most blessed trinite in
most convenient time before ordened took flesche and blood of the most
blessed virgin our lady seynte Marie for the redemption and salvation of
mankind that was lost before for Adams sin. And I believe that Jesus Christ
our lord which is both god and man is hedde of all holy church / and that
all tho that been or shall be saved ben members of this most holy church /
which holy church is departed in three parts / of the which one part is now
in heaven / that is to fay / ye seyntes that in this life lived accordingly with
ye most blessed law of Christ and his lyui^g / despising and forsaking ye
deuell and his works / ye prosperites of this world and the foul lust of ye
flesch. The.ij. part is in purgatory abidi^g the mercy of god / and purging
the^ there of their sins / of ye which they have be^ truly confessed in deed
or else in will to have be^. The.iij. part of this chirch is here in earth / ye
which is called ye fyghti^g chirch / for it fights every day and night agenst
ye temptacio^ of ye deuell / ye prosperity of this false failing world / and
the proud rebellion of the flesch agenst ye soul. This chirch is departed by
ye most blessed ordinance of god into three estates yt is to say / priesthode
/ knighthode / and como^s / to every estate of ye which god gave charge ye one
should help a another / and none destroy other. As to priests / they should
be most holy and lest worldly and treuly living as nere as they could after
the example of Christ and his apostles. And all their business should be day
and night in holy example of living and true preachinge and teaching of
gods law / to both the other parts. And also they should be most meke /
most seruisable / and most louly in spirit both to god and to man. In the.ij.
part of this chirch yt is knyghthod ben contained all that bear the sword by
law of office / which should mainteyne gods law to be preached and taucht
to the people and principally the gospel of Christ / and treuly to live
thereafter: the which part should rather put them self to parell of death /
than to suffer any law or constitucion to be made of man / where through the
fredome of gods law might be let to be preached and tauchte to the
people / or whereof any error or heresye might grow in the church. For I
suppose fully that there may come none heresye nor error among the people /
but by false laws / constitucyons / or teachynges contrary to Christ's law /
or by false lesynges. Also the second part should defendethe common people fro
tyrauntes oppressors and extorcioners / and maynteyn ye clergy doing dewly
their office / in preachinge / teaching / prayng / and freely ministering the
sacraments of holy chirch. And if this clergy be negligent in doing this
office / this second part of the church ought by their office that they have
taken of god to constreyne the clergy in dew wise to do their office in the
form that god has ordened it to be done. The third part of this fighting
chirch owes to bear good will to lords and to priests / treuly to do their
bodily labor in tilling the earth / and with their true merchandise doing
their deuties that they owe both to knyghthode and to priesthode / as gods
law lymeteth keeping feithfully the co^maundme^tes of god. Moreover I believe
all ye sacraments of holy chirch for to be medfull and profitable to all that
shall be saved / taking them after ye intent that god and holy church have
ordened. And for as mekell as I am sclaundered falselye of my believe in the
sacrament of the altar / I do all Christen men to wit / that I believe verily
that the most blessed sacrament of the altar is very Christ's body in form
of bread / ye same body yt was borne of ye blessed virgin our lady seynte Mary
/ done on the cross / deed / buried / and on ye third day rose from death to
life / ye which body is now glorified in heaven Also I believe that all goddis
law is true / and who that lives contrariously to this blessed law / and so
contynewith to his lives end and dies so brekyng the holy commaundementis of
god that he shall be dampnyd into everlasting peynes. And he that will learn
this most blessed law and live there after keeping these holy commaundementis of
god and ends in charity shall have everlasting bliss. Also I understand
that this folowith of believe / that our lord Jesus Christ yt is both god and
man asks no more here in earth / but yt he obey to him after the form of his
law in true keeping of it. And if any prelate of the church ask more
obedience than this of any man living / he exaltith himself in that above
Christ / and so he is an open Antichriste. Also these points I hold as of
believe in especial. And in general / I believe all that god will that I believe
/ praing at the reverence of almighty god to you my liege lord / that this
believe might ben examyned by the wisest and trewest clerkis of your realm /
and if it he trewthe / that it might be confermyd / and I to be holden for a
true christen man: and if it be false that it might be dampened / and I tauchte
a better believe by goddis law / and I will gladly obey thereto.

This forsaid believe the lord Cobham wrote and took it with him and offered
it to the king for to see / and the king would not receive it / but bad him
take it to them that should be his judges. And than the lord of Cobham offered
to bring before the king to purge him of all error and heresy that they would
put against him an hundred knights and squteres. And also he offered to fight
with any man christen or hethen yt would say yt he were false in his believe /
except the king and his brethren. And after he said / he would submit him to all
manner correccio^ that any man would correct him after goddis law. And not
withstanding all this the king suffered him to be somoned personally in his
own chamber. And the lord of Cobham said to the king / that he had appeled
to the pope fro the Archebisshop / wherefore he said he ought not to take him
for his judge / and so he had there his appele ready written / and shewid it
to the king: and therewith / ye king was more angry and said. He should not
pursue his apele / but rather he should be i^ ward till his appele were
admitted: and than would he or not / he should be his judge. And thus nothing
of all this might be allowed / but because he would not swear to submit him to
the church and take what penance the Archebisshop would inioyne him / he was
arested and sent to the tower of London to keape his day that the bishop
assigned him in the kings chamber. And than he made the believe before said with
the answers to four points that now follow to be written in two parts of an
endenture. And when he came to answer he gave that one part to the bisshope /
and that other part he kept to himself.

The endenture of the lord Cobham
I John^ Old castle knight and lord of Cobham will yt all christian men were
/ how yt Thomas of Arundell Archebisshop of Canterbury has now leyde
maliciously and vntreuly by his letter and his seal written of me in
sclaunderous wise yt I should otherwise feale and teach of ye sacrame^tis of
holy church / assyning in special ye sacrament of ye altar / the sacrament
of penance / and also in worshipping of ymagis / and in going on pilgrimagis:
otherwise than fealeth and teaches the universal holy church. I take
almighty god to witness yt it has been and now is / and ever with the help of
god shall be mine intent and my will to believe feithfully and treuly in all the
sacrame^tis yt ever god ordened to be done in holy church. And more over for
to declare me in these points a foresaid. I believe that ye most worshipful
sacrament of ye altar is very Christ's body in form of bread / ye same body
yt was borne of the blessed virgin our lady saint Marie done on ye cross /
deed and buried / and the third day rose fro death to life / ye which body is
now glorified in heaven Also as for ye sacrament of penance I believe yt it is
needful to eueri man yt shall be sauyd to forsake sin / and to do dew
penance for sin before done / with true confession / very co^tricio^ / and
dew satisfaccio^ / as goddis law limeteth and teaches / and else may he not be
sauyd / which penance I desire all men to do And as for ymagis I understand
that they be not of belefe but they were ordened (syns believe was geuyn of
Christ) by sufferaunce of the church for to be kalenderis to lay men to
represente and bring to mind the passion of our lord Jesus Christ / and
martyrdom / and good living of other saints. And that who so it be that does
the worship to deed images that is dew to god / or puttith hope feyth or
trust in help of them / as he should do to god or has affeccio^ in one
more than in a another / he does in that ye great sin of ydolatrie. Also I
suppose this fully / that every man in this earth is a pilgreme toward bless
or toward pain. And that he that knowith not nor will not know nor keep ye
holy commaundementis of god in his living here / all be it / that he go on
pilgrimage into all the world / and he dye so / he shall be dampened And he
that knows the holy commaundeme^tis of god and kepith them to his end he
shall be sauyd / though he never in his life go on pilgrimage as men use now to
Canterbury or to Rome or to any other place.

This believe indented conteinyng the forsaid believe with these forsaid answers
he took to ye bisshops when he came to answer on the saturday next before
Michelmesse in the year aforesaid. And what so ever the bisshopes asked him he
badde them look what his bill said thereto / and thereby would he stand to the
death: other / answer gave he not that day / but the bisshopes were not quietyd
herewith. And the Archebisshop badde him take auysement till moneday next
following to answer to this point / If there remained material bread in the
sacrament of of the altar after the wordis of consecracion. And in the mean
time he perceiuyd that the vttermoste malice was purposed against hi^ how so
ever he answered: therefore he putt his life in goddis hand and answered thus
as folowith

This is the judgment and sentence geuyn upon sir John Old castle knight and
lord of Cobham the moneday next before michelmesse day at the friars prechers
in London in the year of our lord a thousand four hundred and thirtene? the
Archebisshop of Canterbery / the bishop of London / the bishop of winchester
/ and the bishop of Bangar / Master John^ witna^ / Master John^ whytehede
doctors of divinity Master Philip Morgan / Master henry ware Master John^
kempe doctors of law. And sir Robert wambnell vicare of saint Laurence in the
iewrie / Master John^ Steuenes / Master James Colenotaries / with the four
orders of friars / and many other clerkis demyng and co^uicting him for an
heretic and a cursed man. The Archebisshop made all these clerkys and doctors
both religious and seculers to swear upon a book that they should not for love
or favor of the one party / nor for any envy or hatrede of the other party /
say nor witness but ye truth. And the two forsaid notaries were swore^ also to
write and to witness ye wordis and process y^ were to be said on both the
parties / and to say ye sothe / if hit otherwise were.

After this the lord of Cobha^ came / and was brought before them all to his
examinacion and to his answer.

Than the Archebisshop said to him. Lord of Cobham ye ben auysed well enough
of the wordis and process that were said to you upon saturday last paste in
the chapter house of Paulis / the which process were now to long to rehearse.
Than I proffered to have assoiled you (for ye were acursed) of your contumacy
and disobedience to holy church.

Than said the lord Cobham forth with. God says. Maledica^ benedictionibus
vestris that is to say / I shall curse your blessings

Than said the Archebisshop. Sir than I peroffered to have assoiled you if ye
would have asked it / and yet I do the same.

Than said the lord of Cobham. Nay forso the / I trespased never against you /
and therefore will I not do it. And with that he kneled down on the pauement /
and held up his handis and said. I shryue me to god and to you all sirs / yt
in my youth I have synnyd greatly and grievously in lechery and in pride and
hurt many men and done many other horrible sins / good lord I cry the
mercy. And therewith wepingly he stood up ageyn and said. Here / for the
brekyng of goddis law and his commaundementis ye cursed me not / But for your
own laws and traditions above goddis law / and therefore it shall be destroyed.

Than the Archebisshop examined ye lord of his believe. And ye lord of Cobha^
said. I believe fully in all goddis law / and I believe yt it is all true / and
I believe all that god will that I believe.

Than the Archebisshop examined him of the sacrament of the altar / how he
believed therein.

The lord of Cobha^ said. Christ upon shere thursday at night sitting with
his disciples at ye supper / after yt he had supped he took bread / and
geuyng thankis to the fader he blessed it and brake it / and gave it to his
disciples saying / take and eat ye of this all / this is my body yt shall be
betrayed for you / do you this in the remembrance of me. This believe I said
he.

Than the Archebisshop asked him / if it were bread after the consecracion and
the sacrame^tall words said.

The lord of Cobham said. I believe that the sacrament of the altar is very
Christ's body in form of bread / the same body ye was borne of the virgin
Mary / done on the cross / deed and buried / and the third day rose fro death
to life which body is now glorified in heaven.

Tha^ said one of ye doctors of law After ye sacrame^tall words said / there
remains no bread but the body of Christ.

Than the lord of Cobham said to one Master John^ whitehede. You said to me in
the castle of Cowling / that the ooste sacred was not Christ's body But I said
/ yt was Christ's body / though seculers and friars hold each one agenst other
in this opinion.

Than said they. We say all that it is goddis body. And they asked him whether
it were material bread after the consecracion.

Than said the lord I believe that it is Christ's body in form of bread Sir
believe ye not thus?

And the Archcbisshop said. Ye.

Than the doctors asked him whether it were only Christ's body after the
consecracion and no bread.

And he said to them. Yt is Christ's body and bread: for right as Christ was
here in ma^hode / and the godhede hid in the manhood / so I believe verily /
that Christ's flesche and his blood is hid there in the form of bread.

Than they smylde each one on other demyng him takyn in heresy / and said / it
is an heresy.

The Archebisshop asked him / what bread it was / and the clerkis also whether
it were material or not.

Than the lord said / the gospel spekith not of this term material / and
therefore I will not / but I say / it is Christ's body and bread. For ye
gospel says. Ego sum panis viuus qui de celo descendi / th^at is to say. I am
quick bread / that came down from heaven. For as our lord Jesus Christ is
very god and very man / so the most blessed sacrament of the altar is Christ's
body and bread.

Than they said it is an heresy to say that it is bread after the consecracion
and the sacramental words said / but only Christ's body.

The lord said. Saint Paul the apostle was as wise as ye be^ / and he called
it bread / where he says thus. The bread yt we break / is it not the
partetaking of ye body of the lord?

Than they said. Paul must be other wise understood / for it is an heresy
to say that it is bread after the consecracion / but only christ's body / for
it is against the determinacion of the church. Than they asked hi^ whether he
believed not in the determinacion of ye church.

And he said to the^. No forsothe / but I believe all gods law and all that
god will that I believe / but not in your law nor in your determinacion / for
ye be no part of holy church / as openly your dedis show / but very
Antichrists contrary to gods law. For ye have made laws for your covetousness.

This they said was heresy / not for to believe in the determinacion of ye
church.

Than the Archbishop asked him / what was holy church.

He said. I believe yt holy chirch is ye number of all the^ that shall be saved
/ of whom Christ is head / of yt which chirch one part is in heaven / an other
in purgatory and the third here in earth. This part here stands in three
degrees and estates / priestehode / knighthode / and the comunalte / as I said
plainly in my believe.

Than the arbtshop said to hi^. Wot you who is of this church / it is doubt
to you who is thereof / ye should not judge.

The lord said. Operibus credit / iustu^ iudiciu^ iudicate / that is to say.
Believe ye the works judge ye rightful judgment. And also he said to them
all. Where find ye by gods law / that ye should sit thus upon any man or any
mannis death as ye do / but Anna and Cayphas sat and judged Christ / and so do
you.

Tha^ said they. Yes sir. Christ judged Judas

The lord of Cobham said. No. Christ judged not Judas / but he judged himself /
and went and hanged himself: but Christ said. Woe to him / as he does to many
of you. For syns ye venyme was shed in to ye church / ye followed never Christ
/ nor ye stood never in perfection of gods law.

Than the Archbishop asked him what was that venyme.

The lord said. The lordshippes and possessions. For than cried an angel / woe
/ woe / woe / this day is venyme shed into the chirch of god / for before that
time there were many martirs of popis / and syns I ca^ tell of none: but sothe it
is / syns yt time one has put down a another / and one has slain a another /
and one has cursed a another as the cronicles tell / also of much more
cursednesse. Also he said. Christ was meke / and the pope is proud. Christ was
pore and forgave / ye pope is rich and a ma^slear / as it is openly proved.
And thus this is ye neste of Antichriste / and out of this neste comes
Antichrists disciples / of whom these monks and friars ben the tail.

Tha^ said the priour of ye friar Austines. Sir why say ye so?

And ye lord of Cobham said / for as ye be^ pharisees divided / and divided in
habit: so ye make diuisi^on among ye people. And thus these friars and monks
with soch other / be ye me^bres of ye neste of antichrist. And he said. Christ
says. Woe be to you scribes and pharifies ypocrites / for ye close up ye
kingdom of heaven before me^ / for sothe ye enter not your self / nor ye will
not suffer them yt would to enter in / and thus ye be ye disciples of Antichrist
For ye will not suffer gods law to go through nor to be taucht and preched of
good priests / which will speak against your sins and repreue the^ / but of
soch yt be^ flaterers which sustain you in your sins and cursednes.

Tha^ said ye archbishop. By our lady sir / there shall no soche preach that
preaches dissensyon and division if god will.

Tha^ said ye lord of Cobham to ye archbishop Christ says / yt there shall be
so great tribulacio^ as never was syns ye begi^ni^g. And this shall be in your
days / and by you: for ye have slain many me^ and mo shall hereafter / but
Christ s^ith except yt those days were shortened / no flesch should be saved
/ but hastly god will short your days. Forthermore bishops / priests / and
dyacons ben grounded in gods law / but not these other religions / as far
as I can wete.

Tha^ a doctor of law one master Ihon kempe put to hi^ these four points
that follow. The faith and the determinacio^ of holy chirch touching ye blessed
sacrament of ye altar is this / yt after ye sacramental words ben said of a
priest in his mass / ye material bread yt was before is turned into Christ's
body / and the material wine yt was before is turned in to Christ's very blood
/ and so there remains in ye sacrament of ye altar no material bread nor
material wine / ye which were there before the sayng of ye sacrame^tall
words. Sir believe ye not this?

The lord of Cobha^ said. This is not my believe. For my believe is as I said
to you before / that ye worshipful sacrament of ye altar is very chhristes
body / in form of bread.

Than said the archebishoppe. Sir Ihon / ye must say otherwise.

The lord of Cobham said. Nay / if god will but that it is christ's body in
form of bread / as all the common believe is.

The doctor said. The second is this / yt holy church has determined / yt
every christian man living bodily upon earth owes to be shriue^ to a priest
ordened by ye church / if he may come to him. Sir what say ye to this?

The lord answered and said A seake man and sore wounded had need to have a
sure leche and a true / knowing his cure / and therefore a man should
principally be shreuen to god / and else his confession is noucht. And a man
should rather go and be counsellid with a good priest that knowith goddis law
and lives thereafter than with his own priest if he were an evil man or with
any other soche.

The doctor said. The third is this. Christ ordenyd saint Peter apostle to
be his vicare i^ earth / whose see is ye church of Rome ordenyng and granting
that the same power that be gave to peter should succeed to all Peter's
successors the which we call now the popis of Rome / by whose power in the
church particulerly and specially ben ordenyd prelates as Archebisshopis /
Bisshopes / and other degrees to whom christen men owe to obey after the law
of ye church of Rome. This is the determinacion of the church.

To this he answered and said. Who that follows next Peter in living is next
him in succession / but your living refuses poor peter's living and many other
popes that were martirs in Rome that followed peter in manner of living whose
conditions ye have clean forsakyn / all the world may know it well.

The doctor said. The fourth point is this. Holy church has determined /
that it is medefull to a christen man to go on pilgrimages to holy places / and
there specially to worship holy relics of seyntes / apostles / martirs /
confessors and all seyntes approuyd by the church of Rome.

To this he said. Yt were enough to bury saints fair in the earth / but now
saints that be dead ben compellid to beg for covetousness the which in their
life hated covetousness and begging / but I say to you all / and know it for a
treuthe / that with your shrynes and ydoles and your feyned absolucions and
indulgencis and your te^poraltes / ye draw to you all the richesse of this
world. Why sir said one of the clerkis / will ye not worship ymagis?

What worship said the lord.

Tha^ said friar Palmer. Sir ye will worship the cross of Christ that he died
on.

Where is it? said the lord.

The friar said. I put case sir that it were here before you.

The lord said. This is a ready man to put to me a question of a thing / that
they wot never where it is. And yet I ask you / what worship.

A clerk said. Soche worship as Paul spekith of / that is this. God forbid me
to joy but in the cross of our lord Jesus Christ.

Than said the lord / and spread his arms abroad. This is a very cross.

Than said the bishop of London. Sir ye wot well that he died on a material
cross.

Than said the lord. Our salvation came in only by him that died on the cross
and by the material cross. And well I wot yt this was the cross that Paul
ioyed on / that is / in the passion of our lord Jesus Christ.

The Archebisshop said. Sir John^ ye must submit you to the ordinance of the
church.

The lord said. I wot not whereto.

Than the Archebisshop read a bill of his judgment and convicted him for an
heretic.

After the reding of the bill / the lord said. Though ye judge my body / I
hope to god that he will save my soul and he said that he would stand to the
death by these things before said. With the help of Jesus. And than he said to
all the people. Sirs for goddis love be well ware of these men / for they will
begile you else / and led you blyndelinges in to hell and themself also. For
Christ says if one blind man led a another / both fall in to the ditche And
after this / thus he prayed for his enemies and said Lord god I beseech the
forgive my persewe^s / if it be thy will. And than he was led a geyne to ye
tower of London / and thus was the end.

WHile the lord of Cobham was in the tower he sent out privily to his frendis
/ and they at his desire enfourmyd and writ this bill that folowith next /
commending it to ye people / that they should cease ye sclau^ders and leasynges
/ yt his enemies made on him.

FOr as mekill as sir John^ Old castle knight and lord of Cobham is vntreuly
convicted and prysoned / and falsely reported and sclaundered among the people
by his adversaries / yt he should other wise feale and speak of the sacramentis
of holy church / and specially of the blessed sacrament of the altar / than
was written in his believe which was indented and takyn to the clergy and set
up in diverse opyn placis in the cite of London Known be it to all the world
that he never varied in any point there fro but this is plainly his believe
that all the sacraments of holy church ben profitable and medefull to all
the^ that shall be sauyd taking them after the intent that god and holy church
has ordenyd. Ferther more he beleuith that the blessed sacrament of the altar
is verily and treuly Christ's body in form of bread Truth long hyd now is
dysclosed / Praised be god. Amen.
