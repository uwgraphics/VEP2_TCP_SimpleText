A HERRINGS Tail: Containing a Poetical fiction of diverse matters worthy the
reading.

At London Printed for Matthew Lownes. 1598.

A Herrings Tail.
I Sing the strange adventures of the hardy Snayle,
Who durst (unlikely match) the weathercock assail:
A bold attempt, at first by fortune flattered
With boot, but at the last to bale abandoned.
Help sportfull Muse to tune my gander-keaking quill,
And with inck blotles of sad merriments it fill,
With drum of clapped wings, and with the shrilly blast
Of his throat trumpet, Chaunticleere, now third and last,
Had sounded a discharge unto the welkin watch,
To leave their stand, and give their shot, and quench their match.
And dame Aurora now faithful Ambassadresse
Of the newborn day, and of the nights decease,
The purple violets, and crimson roses, culd
In Paradise, had from her fragrant chaplet pulled,
And strowde before Dan Phoebus feet, and now began he
With peacock priding rays, th'awaked worlds glee,
To climb the Eastern hills, and with light skips to play
Between the wrinckles of the furrow faced sea,
When rested Lymazon, thrusts his fenceles head
Out at his dooreles house, and with eye measured,
How far he climed had, how far he had to clime,
What guess proportion plots, to cunning toil and time:
Where whiles he humbles sight to the disdained ground,
More then his hope could crave, he his atchiuement found.
But raising look again to relics of his race,
Less then his wish would have, did his attempt embrace.
Thus joy of what was past, and fear of what was left,
Though wonder much it gave, despair not wholly reft.
Sore grieves he at the pain, but more he doubts the shame:
For vnbegun then not to end, breeds meaner blame.
What may he then resolve? retire is infamous,
Still standing frivolous, ascending dangerous.
So have I seen a gallant Impe, of sturring blood,
Presuming greatest bliss, in the untried good,
By his vain copesmates drawn, and by his promise tide,
In quest of fleeting gain, some wooden horse to ride:
Where while on traitor sea, and mid the mutiue winds,
His freedom thralde, health paird, and life engagde he finds,
Not able to forgo, nor to perform his task,
What there he makes, does with too late repentance ask:
Yet cloak of virtue on necessity he throws,
And rather blamed then shamed, at last he homeward goes.
So Lymazon goes on, and climes the haughty tower,
Haught more then that which Caesar's ashes did embowre:
Or those of Pharaohs, who with ambitious strife
By their death houses deemed to ouerliue their life.
This apizing in shape and hew, the spiry fire,
Like stying does to his like element aspire:
And for this cause was built,
Fame says, when Other to the fair Igernas bed,
Made way on carcass of her husband slaughtered:
She causer of the fact, not partner of the guilt,
Washed with her tears the blood by others hand yspilt,
And sought with price of borrowd merits to enrich
Her either make, who did, and suffered too much:
Tyntagill was the place where she exchanged loves,
Tyntagill was the place where to both their behoues
She reares a stately house, which lowly Munks may haunt
For their souls requiem, sad spells to chat and chaunt:
Whose Cells environed a temple rare of frame,
For substance rare, more rare for form that decked the same:
But rarest for the steeple, which with wonder rose
In that huge temples waste, and wonder ouergrowes:
The foot whose large assise this Giant body bare,
Were squarie faced stones, with sides outlayed square,
Marble the stones, the sides, rule (king of measure) skand,
Three hundred broad to stretch, high fifty foot to stand:
Within a labyrinth of wenlace thwarting ways,
By searchers errors blazed the Craftmans ready praise:
Such one he once deuisde to hide a hateful Love,
Whose vnflidge bird did skils flight by falling prove:
And such one made the first and great'st Plantagenet,
His worlds rose, but rose unclean, there safe to set,
Unhappy spur to draw, unhappy clew to sow,
Beloueds death, the wives revenge, and husbands woe.
But what Daedale began, and Harrie followed,
Art and experience here past mendment perfected.
This platformes shoulders underwent th'abating weight
Of Porphirie Pyramides, which told in height
Three hundred halfes of feet, and halfed that at base,
Their number five, and Quiueunx wise they stood in place.
At point, each broached a beguiled ropper mound,
All which a Petasus of fine Electre crowned,
Whose edgeyfrendged rang with silver bells about,
Charm taught the wind, wind them, and the shaven rout,
When Dorter loath to leave, when people loathed quire,
Thereon up second climeth a four taled spire,
Fine skore the foot did skore along their Jasper side,
Their tops of polisht Geat, a table paued wide:
So our Deawes-sonne sometimes an hold most circle makes,
Now lines in angles sharp, now in obtuse he brakes:
There true love knots he twines, here paints some flowers or tree,
Uncouth the shapes, but bootfull to his bent they be.
The Circles to compass, the Angles up to get,
The knots to bind, the trees and flowers a grace to set,
And where so Art, or fortune taught, or brought his ways,
Auernishon his footsteps smooth and bright he lays:
Smooth as the path, which under walking fingers yields,
And twixt two hillocks leads unto the Elician fields,
Bright as the worm, whose tail the high ways side bestarres,
And on the helm for Canuisado serves in wars:
And now by scale he shortened had the steep ascent,
And with glad eye laid holdfast on the battlement:
When Alectrauemos from battlement espide
Another steeple cleaving to that steeples side,
Which strange Geometry, follies Impe, wonder bred:
Wonder, by reason the strangenes examined;
If life it had, where is the shape that bodies bear?
If life it lackt, so far, so high, how stuck it there?
If somewhat else it brought, where was the bringer gone?
If self it came, where were the feet it went upon?
If walled house, how it to move so could he see?
If move it did, a walled house how could it be?
Yet it a life enjoyed, and life a body clad,
And body feet possessed, and feet were skild to gad:
And all this had a house, and house all this did hold,
And both did move, and both were moved, as shall be told.
When Saturn by revenge (whereto even natures kind
Binds what so she breeds) did overtaken find
His never turning course of unkind cruelty,
And headlong tumbled from that godlike sou'raigntie:
Whose frail foundation on wickedness was pight,
Dislikte, withstood, fought with, vanquished, chased to flight,
An old man by a young, a father by his son,
A King by his subject, he all forlorn did won:
Sometimes on mountains rough, sometimes on surging waves,
Sometimes in forests wild, sometimes in hollow causes,
Of safety as unsure, as sure of misery,
Still doubting least his very hides would him descrie,
The hills by their rising, by their roaring the floods,
The vaults by ecchoing, by whispering the woods:
Amongst those refuges, silly refuges sought,
Fortune or fate at last to the Snayles house him brought.
That time all Snayles alike rom'd naked lym'd abroad,
Nor partial weight did more the tone then the other load.
But as the Lion has his den, his comb the Be,
The Fox his cabin, Cony berry, Squirrell tree,
Ant hill, Hare form, Rat neast, and hole the petty Mouse:
So had each wandering Snayle his vnremouing house.
Now Saturn led by fear, which nearly prieth, crept
Close into one of these, and out the owner kept:
Himself a tyrant, forced by a more tyrant, need,
Ne false, though strange, let pausing credit deem this deed.
For if great Gods with shapes of men themselves have clothed,
Nor form of beasts (thralled to sinful lusts) have lothed:
Why would they not as soon? why might they not as well?
Their lithie bodies bound with limits of a shell?
Now when time (Lord of change) had reconcilement wrought
Betwixt the sire and son, and Jove, home Saturn brought:
He, though constrained courtesy, yerne slight reward,
Yet what befitted him to yield, did more regard,
Then what the other ought receive: and so he gave
What ever bootfull boon the Snayle best like to crave.
Even as a ship whom diverse winds and billows sway
From side to side, and too much driving force to stay:
So his desire by diverse tides of shocking thought,
Tossed here and there, unsettled long resolved on naught,
Till him discourse enform'd that every perfect good,
Waters his neighbor fields with his wealbearing flood:
And that none ill there grows whose branches venomous,
Disperse not wide their leaves and shade infectious:
Wherefore to take the good and to forsake the ill,
He choice made to exchange his neighbor head at will,
And still to bear, and still to use his shellie cave
For house, for fort, for clothes, for bed, and for his grave.
Saturn assents, the Charter tayled is in fee,
And all house Snayles from him derive their pedigree:
So wedded he his house, and so he crawles and clings,
And to Alectrauemos nearer defiance brings.
Who of his steale-step march has still a fresh auize,
To his ripening knowledge conveyed by his eyes:
They show him first a hill, or fort, or tower, or all,
Or like to all, built of a thin strong cloamy wall:
Not Samian clay (potters chief pride) can match with this,
Nor seen through Porcelaine that so long tempring is:
His form a winding round proffring easy ascent,
Decreasing in his growth and in a point yspent.
Such Babel was, if painters (poets kin) do right,
Save Babel ceast at halues, this vaunts a perfect plight:
A compass vaulted Arch at foot wide income yields,
Keysars model t'engraue on like their bloody feelds:
His color Iris like, but as with storm defaste,
Or the early morning gray: but as with cloud disgraste,
And still as more he looked, more cause of fear he took,
And as he feared more, that causde him more to look,
Till the less distance scope at full gave to his sight,
And showde a whole with borrowed remnants many dight,
A Libbards face, a Panthers neck, belly of Tode,
Snakes skin, a Tortoys tail, a Camels back with lode,
No feet, yet skill to stalk, no claws yet power to hold,
No blood but in his lieu a liquide Crystal cold:
I quake to speak, yet speak I must of each his horn,
Th'offensiue armor of a double Unicorn,
Straight as two lances coucht by Orped Knight in rest,
Pliant as sinowy arm of wrastler nimbellest,
Out with vprising pride by stolen degrees they grow,
And in retire with speed, if cause occasion show:
Even as the heele-bite Serpent darteth forth his spear,
Which on his point does sting, venom, and murder bear,
And in with spoils it plucks, but this works feller harm:
For Serpent threats with hiss, no warning here does arm.
Yet natures wise foresight, (foresight wisely ordaines)
Though power to hurt she give, with bayles yt power restraines:
So Wolf the least stone dreads, the Oliphant the Mouse,
And by Cocks crowing dared the Lion flies the house:
So testie stinging Drane but once can wreake his spite,
So Vipers wife, his head their brood her belly bite.
And so in either lance Dame natures kind remorse,
With a mourn head temps their else all slaying force:
Yet as her marshall Impe not in full feature borne,
Or as the troncheons left, the rest to shiuers torn,
Or as the menace of a new supply at hand,
Two young grown staves at foot with heads out peering stand:
So strangie sight just wonder breeds and wonder doubt,
And doubt assembles of sad fears an ugly rout:
Who saulting Alectrauemos sought, but in vain,
To force him cut with fethrie sheares the sky curtain:
For he was to that service bound in prentisage
For many years, thus wise by Merlin ouersage.
Far hence away in country of the clowdie skies,
A dungeon deep and large beset with hills there lies,
Where blustering winds and shipwreck storms a boystrous throng,
With bolts on locks, and bars on bolts, in prison strong
Are fast vpclosde, they struggling wrestle, hiss and rote,
And rage on rage, by exercise encreasen more,
Contending forth to break that empiring alone,
New Chaosde heaven and earth they may confound in one.
But AEolus aloft with threatening mace restraines
Their fury, and in bonds within bounds them contains.
There is his realm and reign, there does his palace stand,
And those mouths breath or blow, as his mouth list command.
It fortuned this band was sent abroad to chase
The fogs, and dust to sweep, from old earths rugged face:
Who, as they tennisde up and down with skittish play,
And in this nether air to make new clouds assay,
Sly Merlin comes the while, and spying Elpie tide,
Snatched up and hid this bird, and away with him hide:
And hither he him brought, and on the spire him set,
And by his mighty charms bound him in endless det,
With true measured crowing, the timely hours to speak,
And still against his windy fire to wind his beak:
All other weathercocks that can but creake and hiss,
Are counterfeits of this, and counterfeits to this.
But whence he came, and why him AEole did auow,
Listen my Lordings gent, and I shall tell you how.
As long, as sore King AEole Deiopeia loved,
Sorenes the length encreast, the length the sorenes proved.
This, sundry means out sought, in sundry shows expressed,
All meeting in one end to have his grief redrest.
Sometimes with stilly breath he whispered in her eat,
And mixed sighs did both message and witness bear:
Sometimes in Lays he sung, whistled and pipte his woe,
Which proving vain, he in a rage would storm and blow.
But straight repentance should them melt in showrie tears,
And he lie still as dead, and buried in despayres,
Often adding deeds to words when she list take the air,
He would his lodging take in her recrispled hair,
And lovely hedged in by that gold wyrie frith,
Though bound himself, yet fast and loose he played therewith.
Often would he stealing kiss her equal blissed lips,
Often in her sweeter bosom throw sweet flowers slips,
And often her tucked weed above her knee he bore,
To true heart, false to love, that might, and durst no more:
But vndefilde, though touched, she Cupids shafts did ward
With shield of chastity, Dymond as fair so hard:
Juno, great heavens Queen, in their demeanor red,
This courting and coyness, and therefore promised
If he the Trojans wrack, her ioynter would consent,
One Hymen's knot should make her willing him content:
But though her Mistress, Queen and Goddess Juno wear,
Yet to Dianas heasts she greater awe did bear,
And mouer of those broils, her self unmoved stood.
When AEole seeing all those ils work little good,
His suit not heard, or not conceived, his gifts refusde,
Or little reakt, his service scorned, or not used,
He casts about another course of policy:
A yoke of peacocks native tired gorgeously
Did Iunos chariot draw, and Deiopeia stood
Charged to cate them charily, dry, and liquid food:
Ambrosia was their meat, and Nectar was their drink,
In Iuorie troughs vpheapt, and filled to the brinke.
Now fortune (Lovers friend) so guided AEolus,
That one of those he got, and gave to Zephirus
Sweet breathed Zephirus, who (Psyche like) away
With bloomie gale him bare, and in sure guard did lay,
A lowly vale, Tempe yclipt, in Greece there lies,
Twixt Ossa and Olympus hills, which stately rise,
And with their beetle brows that far prospect deny,
Which their avoiding sides proffer the rouing eye:
All in a vesture of green grass apparelled,
With guard of roses and sweet flowers embrodered,
And entersowed trees (like ouches) yield a grace,
Whose waste the climing Iuie and woodbine embrace:
But they scorn proffred love, and without spreaded arms
Protect the nursling herbs from Phoebus fiery harms:
Upon their fingers perch the bushie burgesses,
A little quire, but well their tune they couth express,
And in consorting lays with sweet according note,
The God of natures praise they carolled by rote.
The croaking Rau'n from his hoarse throat the base out fetched,
And clime-skie Lark aloft unto the trebble stretched:
The quierman Thrush alowd the countertenor rang,
And falling sickly Quail next ground the tenor sang,
Cuckoo the burden bare, Nightingale deskanted,
Kind Robin warbelled, the Thrustle whisteled:
Low under these so peopled tops protection,
Springs here and there out sprout, and downwards trickling run,
Springs fair to sight, pleasant for taste, pleasing of sound,
In feeling cool, and in their savor fragrant found,
Who where they after other each to bottom fall,
Peneus river make, that nameles drownes them all:
He this new tribute bears to the grand tyrant Sea,
Yet dreading like success long loyters by the way,
And seems with turning course to seek his spring again,
And fretting gnawes the bank that would his bent restrain:
The whiles one late come wave the other drives on,
Whose mate like fast him shooues, till all unawares be gone.
In fine, Hills, Vale, Trees, Springs, and Brook ambitiously,
Nature pranked with pomp for triumph of the eye:
After long easy flight, Dan Zephirus his lode
Softly disburdened, and here it safely stood,
And Boreas had charge (fit Iaylour for a rape)
With eye to watch, with blast to stop his sought escape.
When thus the Peacock was dispatched, AEole begins
To cleave his feet in claws, to stalks to sharp his shins,
His body he contrived, his neck he lengthened,
Pinions he made his arms, with horn he beakt his head,
His clothes to feathers waxt, his crown a copped crest,
His starrie mantle served his crouper to reuest.
In sum, the means unseen, the cause and end well known,
He that erst seemed a God, was now a Peacock grown,
And with his fellow ioynde, and so himself did bear:
Untold, you would have sworn that he a Peacock wear.
No marvel then if Deiopey for such him took,
When she (mistrustles) entered to her charge to look:
Then had the Sun that Zenith climbd strife to decide,
Just arbiter between the morn and even tide,
And truly noble in most height appeared least,
When heat and wearines inuit the Nymph to rest:
And down she lay, her mother earth became her bed,
And brother stone did serve as pillow for her head,
So to deaths harbenger she does her recommend,
Who first her senses lodgde and fancies them vppend:
Soon to the Peacock god his two spies can relate,
The Advantage proffered of her dead living state:
Which hastily he seisde, and with steps nicely bent,
And panting breath, and longing sighs, impatient
Of all delay, guided by hope, he to her drew:
(Hope which most doubt in most assurance does imbew)
Even at the Joyous entry gate amazement yet,
Arrests his foot, and forced him pay the eye his debt,
Who this model of beauty curiously suruaide,
Where nature all her art, art her wit displaide.
But neither can I tell, ne can I stay to tell,
This palace architecture, where perfections dwell:
Who list such know, let him Muses despencier reed,
Or thee, whom England sole did since the Conquest breed,
To conquer ignorance, Sidney like whom endite,
Even Plato would, as Jove (they say) like Plato write:
Her sun bright luster dazzled so his gazing eye,
That it must other senses crave in aid, to try
Where she a living wight, or marble Image were:
What do thou AEolus? to what end came thou there?
Now, or never, and never but now take thy hap,
And ever if now, Love will dandle thee in lap.
But warning none I need to give the hind-bald time,
Better then I he wist, and caught in chiefest prime:
Full like a hardy knight upon her swift he lept,
And with love pressing weight, her from arising kept,
With billing from crying, with comforting from fear,
With hugging from struggling, from ill taking with prayer.
What more they did, and how they greed on the scot,
Speak you, such smell-feast guests, my self I wot it not:
Yet this I know, what was beside her will begun,
And against her will doing, with her good will was done:
And she that down a maid her laid, a woman rose,
Ne Phoebe (who with changeles change still paires or grows)
Had more then thrice three times borrowd her brothers light
To fill her crooked horns, (wan pilots of the night)
When as Lucynas travail her vnweeting cought,
And hatching for childing, an egg to the world she brought,
Which egg disclosde a chick in his due worn time,
Which chick grew to a bird, which bird begat this time.
Strange this may seem, yet true, and reason natural
(Often afterborne) auowes such chances may befall:
For to such work their parts both male and female bring,
The stronger body gives the weaker fostering.
Then might th'assaulting bird, the limbs suite to his kind,
And the weak suffering Nymph, the feeding humor find:
So in her lap, suspectles Leda (false beguilde)
Cherisht a Swan, who made her twinning egg with child.
This bird now waxing flidge, big as the Eagle grew,
His neck with collar decked of purest golden hew,
A purple robe his body clad, pranckt was his train
With intermingled quils of the celestial grain:
Fair starched ruffes attirde his sight alluring face,
His head a copped coronet did comely grace:
But my pale quill dreads to approach the quelling blows
Of that sharp fight, which twixt these cha^pions inward grows.
Help warlike Muse my words to marshall in such sort,
That they this worthy act may worthily report.
The field the steeple top, the lists the steep downfall,
Wind was the Trumpetter, and honor the Marshall,
Ambition and Envy, on the assailants side,
On the defendants, parraines came, disdain and pride:
The equal Judges chosne by both fortune and fate,
But sticklers none, for who durst venture there his pate?
Some soul was looker one, who stood still in amaze,
Or seemed still to stand, delighted with the gaze.
Th'assailants house-shield for defense him best did arm,
And the defendants sword bill served him best to harm,
Yet the defense, means to offend, did also lend,
And the offense, supplied withal, means to defend,
Swift move, but not remove could Alectrauemos,
Slow paced was Lymazon, but where he list he goes,
And for him nature did in less assise contriue,
He causde supplying art to follow, not to strive
With nature, whiles not forth direct his march he takes,
But a wide winding circuit of his way he makes:
Much like the rolling trench by soldiers hand vpcast,
When he approaches his foes fort more sure then fast,
And in his motion continued but slowly,
His eye did guide his pace, his judgment led his eye,
With distance still betwixt them both proportioned,
To what so he attempts or the other offered:
But Alectrauemos of stature great and tall,
Greater in might, and in stout heart greatest of all,
Stands with his trenchant felling bill lifted on hie,
The ruin threatening point bent to his enemy,
As planted canon against a wall pressed to begin,
A battered breach where troops of wounds may enter in.
Thus his advantage each and disadvantage wist,
And how to offer harm, and how harm to resist
In both, skill courage led, and courage armed skill,
So as not rashness ventred force, nor fear abated will,
Both hardy as the best by disposition,
Both hazardous as most by their election,
Both confident as those who loss did never know,
Respectfull both, as knowing well the force of foe,
Who saw the one would think naught could gainsay his might,
Who the other marked would marvel any living wight
Durst hopeles him assault, thus minded, armed thus,
They brought virtue comparde victory to discuss.
But as the wind which faintly breaths twixt leaves at furst,
Soon after grown in force begins the boughs to burst,
Then pulls up trees by th'rootes, and houses throws down,
Till in tempest at sea himself at last he drown.
So these brave champions did at their first approach,
Their fiery courages as twere but wake and broach:
Which joined, begat a combat fit all minds to fear,
That of self constant worthiness not privy wear:
And though amazement seeld with reason march we see,
Reason found reason yet amazed here to be:
For Mars his sportles game was never better played,
Fury in brauer show never it self displaied:
Yet them dread fardest flies, as peril fastest grows,
Like glowormes light which nearer brought the lesser shows.
Thus lavish blows they deal, of which each foremost strived
To run, postillion of death each seemed arrived,
More thick they fall then hail that ears and stalks of corn
Frusheth, and makes hindes harvest hope forlorn,
More heavy seem then thumping engine that down beats
The plumped piles, which serve for wayfare bridges seats,
More loud they sound, then at the forge in smoaky cave
Did uulcans sledge, when battred gads to plates in drove,
That at his courteous wifes request an armor bright,
He then eke courteous shape for AEneas might:
But as the twinny Themis and arm of Ocean flood
Single, rush forth, and kill, and bury, if withstood:
Yet where they meet, and (cosens) kindly should embrace,
They struggle, hiss, and foame, and each would other chase,
That equal ballanst long the bastard brackish wave,
Doubts whither name of salt or fresh overcome to have.
So here forcible skill with counterchange matched,
Such skillful force, and masters both, so perfectly were red,
In distance, time, and motion, schoole-points of fence,
That as the minds like Monarchs, with due diligence
Had their directions in every part obeyed,
So could no other mind with right judgment areade:
Which order, sense, virtue, that warded, or assailed,
Precise, ready, able, most of them both prevailed.
If the one possessed a watchful eye and marched apace,
Steddie, and lance in rest, had couched pressed for chase,
And all bit of respect and courage spur did guide,
Like dreadful might came daring on the other side:
Yet even that might his nimblenes in might did pass,
And nimbler then that nimblenes his judgment was,
In both attempting and preventing seemed foremost,
Alike, and th'answere to th'obiection rode in post:
Th'assailants fence stood most on the defenciue shift,
Who under his embossed targe, retyring swift,
Did part escape, part ward his adversaries blows,
Which to attend, more fond, then shame to shun he knows:
Yet as at high rackt rent he farmed had the soil,
No foot would he surrender, nor one step recoyle,
But with compassing fetch, of fetching a compass,
Occasion watched, vauntages favor to purchase,
And liurie of conquest to have, much like the hound
Which singled Stag at bay, does here and there around,
And like self Stag seeks Alectrauemos again,
With one blow full set home, to stint his further pain
And tothers life: but many loses the mean time:
For though the sparks, or rather Lamps, to heaven up clime
From those fierce dints, which fall as fast as thrashers flaile
On the submitted sheaffe, yet they no more prevail,
Then washfoote wave can move the weather scorning rock,
Or tower deep grounded reakes, the winds loud bragging shock.
So chieftaine, that t'assiedge some town does undertake,
Whose site the wall, and wall turn serving flankers make
Impregnable, now saults the gates, and now some tower
Battreth, here proffers scale, there luggage in does power
To glut the gaping dikes, yet vain proves each pretense,
And lost are men, cost, time, pains, hope and patience:
Nor Fortunes blind eyde smile did more the valor bless,
Of steale-step Lymazon, with hopes heir child success:
For if his armed masts seemed iron horned Ram,
Whose shouldred thrusts at one point leueld, dram by dram,
The mortar maride stones, either dissolve or break,
That ruins gate, many unknown, unwelcome freake,
May in admit, the tothers fether quilted Jack,
No less seemed against this, at new door knocking wrack,
A woolsack roped down, which yielding does resist,
And deads death headed blows that him unfriendly kissed.
Each one has seen a brended Mastiue at the stake
The Bull to bait, diverse a galley undertake
A tall ship to assault, some the Swordfish alone
To set on the huge Whale: but seen have few or none
The Bull to bait the Dog, Hulke Galley to assail,
Whale his armed foe onset: yet here without fail
Like chance was seen, and yet not like in all they squarde,
For here the Cowes son with the whelpsires growth co^parde,
Less showd the brush ore barge in bigness vantage wan,
On ship and Swordfish stature past Leuiathan.
In brief, as far as gold exceeds all baggage pelf,
So all else came behind to match this save it self.
Thus these, who as the Globe is modeld in a heart,
Had Globe of valor in their heart, as in a chart
Comprised, with equal enuide puissance lengthened,
The still straightning battle, and they that combatted
With anger first, self combat now more angereth,
And fight desire, as desire fight engendereth,
If shame disdain prouokt, often for revenge to strike,
Revenge as often revived, disdain to quite with like,
Taking and doing both, gave and received pain,
Doing and taking both wan and retained gain,
Strokes still are heapt on strokes, as fuel put to flame
Embodies more and more, what will devour the same:
Hate bellows was that blew, courage fire that was blown,
Courage to wrath encreast, wrath was to fury grown:
So from self-love vainglory did it self divorce,
Whilst smart waited on blows, as blows waited on force:
So cuffe is quit with cuffe, stricken they strike again,
And beaten beat, so basht at self worth they remain.
Thrice Alectrauemos forced Lymazon recoyle,
As far from his rash hope, as near least feared foil:
Such thundering, lightning bolts thick thick on him he lays,
That garland he despayres of the protecting bays:
Yet each repulse he ransomd with a fresh attempt,
And new won honor did late infamy exempt,
As often did Lymazon tothers hot courage calm,
That Cypress branch he nearer seemed to wear then Palm.
Their eger griping thus long made them naught to strain,
And in assaies to do, times glass ran out in vain,
Whilst self assaies more then performance wearied,
And yet self wearines as long dissembled.
At last weakness in both to such strong mastrie grows,
That as saint drops after fierce storm appeerd their blows:
And schoole-mistris of fools, costly experience
Them taught, that virtue nor fortune award sentence.
For either list or wist so consenting dissent,
Uncoupled their buckling and they asunder went,
Asunder went, but as the bow which yields a space
To the withdrawing string, that his forsaken place
Regaind again, he may th'entrusted shaft out let,
With derner maime and winged tail in hearts blood wet,
Or as two princes of the rich arrayed flock,
Whose armed skonces (engines of battery) entershock,
With backing pace, but threatfull looks not leese, but leave
The conquered soil, that short rest, long delay may reaue:
Nor sloth this space devoured, but each turned this while
Practike to specklatiue, and noting well the style
Of eithers fight, their weapons use, their vauntages,
Meant in one total sum to pay th'arrerages.
And scarce they paused had, when with wrath sparkling eyes,
Reuengefull hearts, and courage resolute, each hyes
To the renewd combat: yet had the sense combinde
Of seeing schoold them so, and feeling disciplinde,
That in repeating their but lately cond lesson,
Respect and doubt conioynd made the construction.
A great desire to overcome did each possess,
But how to overcome the carke was no whit less:
And they who gallopt to an end yet stayed again,
That end by best way of advantage to attain:
For strong assault as strong defense behoues repel,
Least haste to speed banished due care how to speed well.
But who attends each benefit that time brings forth,
(Lingering) shall hardly ought perform that is of worth,
And of th'assailants part, slownes of victory,
On posteth overthrow: wherefore less warily,
And with more hazard, Lymazon in fight was driven
To win or loose, and not to hold the bargain even.
Who whilst he thus appeald to fortune from foresight,
Among many idle strokes of foes roue aiming might,
One from his crested Targe did on his shoulder glaunce,
(Quite destitute of faithful armours purueiance)
And pearcing through his dapple pelt it self fleshed,
And that it did but glaunce, fair was the Snayle blessed.
For had it bitten home, that blow had quit the strife,
And judged the victory, and damned th'assailants life:
Like as the prisond spring, which searching spade lets out
From the earth buried vain, soon, fast, and far does sprout:
So here from th'opened vain spouts forth a crystal blood,
Whose trickles wept (as rain in Sun) a pearly flood,
Dismayed, and near discomfited, in Lymazon retirde,
And chafte, and hist, and foamed, as water vnderfirde
Up flames, and boyles, and casts froth, and oreboord throws
Part of the fraught, to quench the storm, nor all to loose.
On the other side, his foe flaunting in iollitie,
Loud Lopeian sings of near gripte victory.
But pride (ruins forerunner) warnes, when boot is hext,
By fortunes constant inconstance, then bale is next:
For whilst with feathers brushed up, and stretched out neck,
And wings displaid, he sought in mate to end his check:
Lymazon off had shakt fears apprehension,
And judgment in him stablisht resolution:
So as the sparks of his quenched courage quicker grew,
As sturred wine, new settled, wonts more strength accrue:
Wherefore with spite and rage, his bloodles veins filling,
And to one moments service, his sprights coniuring
A horned push, with force by fury creast he drives,
Whose dint with fury seconded by force arriues
At the vnplated side, and through the silken skin
Part goard, part bruised, the guard betrayed flesh within.
But when both thus in blood were enter entered,
And it (allide) their arms with medley garnished,
Which palde and blushed in one, so weak defense to make,
Then, as the trodden Snake, or hurt Lion, for wrake
They thirsted more, then that whole floods of blood the same
Could quench: and though self blood did accusation frame,
And wounds to witness calde of their distressed state,
Yet either choler rest the smart or it relate,
To the fierce mind the fainting sense lackt hardines,
At least no one their action would it confess,
Passion from stern of skill then reason should aside,
And storm of fury raisde, and fury force supplide:
Defenses are forgot, dangers despisde, disdainde
Is hope it self, and even most assurance rainde:
In rash wan hope rage strokes begat, strokes rage encreast,
Each stroke did wound, each wound did threat to slay at least.
But this last act seemed sole some dying candles blase,
Or random shot which wall would pearce, but cannot crase:
For each to other due exchange so long had paid,
That small the remnants fell, and mind in vain assayd:
When strength was vanquished, and nimblenes was fled,
(Forsaken general) to make new stand or head,
Appearance guess enform'd, each prester seemed to die
Accompanied, then either live to victory.
Yet Lymazon* this vantage had, or thought to have,
Latest of both (though soon) to step into the grave:
For though most store of strokes the game dealt to his share,
Wounds Alectrauemos away the sorer bare:
Whence he faint, weary, recreant, abandoned
Of breath, of limbs, of heart, of help, with reake raised
And dropping tail, and drooping cheer (crauen) bewraide,
To yield he not so much refused as delaide.
Which the other spying well, hotly pursues his point,
And each proffred resistance, chops off joint by joint,
Threatening, insisting, striking, wounding, reuelling,
Till meek disarmed stilnes proclaimed his conquering:
Then clibbie ladder against his battered flanck hereares,
And up it him, and he it up, slow scaling bears.
For as the Roman Tyrant, who would feast his cruel eye
With torture of his state-suspected enemy,
The hangman bad so strike as he might feel his death,
Such wise here Lymazon with tedious steps climeth,
That he the sweetness of his victory, and foe,
Might full and longer last his bitter overthrow:
Thear'st never tamed back, new horsman he bestrides,
Whence not so pleased, up his aualing neck he rides,
And there enthroanes himself, on his comb cutted crown
Triumphant wise, and with forced weight it presses down.
His now all needles and near empty hacked sheeld
From shoulder back he throws, and out does mustring yield:
His full grown statute, high his head, looks higher rise,
His pearching horns are ream'd a yard beyond assise,
Then with a stately gate his eyes far journey rome,
And to his mind of fair prospects bring tidings home.
They see the water beurage give to the dry land,
And land to water seat supply with quitting hand,
Without channel or bank, both lovely enterlaste,
Earth borne by The Ocean, Ocean by the earth embraste.
They see the earth somwhere to swollen mountains up blown,
Somwhere leueld to plains, somwhere to vales down thrown:
The mountains lofty heads with bushie locks curled,
The plains gowned with grass, valleys with herbs purled:
They see the forests thick by sauedge beasts possessed,
Cattle people the fields, incomes the vermin nest,
And over all, as Lord of all, they see mankind
Forgetful of his heavenly part, to clay combinde:
They see old folk knock with their staff at gate of grave,
But though forward their pace, froward their face they have:
They see young folk dancing a round to pipe of time,
Whiles at their back steals in the just reward of crime,
And with his dart strikes one, he falls, the other fear
And stand a space amazde: some out the carcass bear,
And they begin a fresh, and so continue on,
Till one by one thus fetched, the dancers all be gone:
They see wives snarling at their too fast coupled feere,
And hindering their own course by haling still a reere:
Maids, pitfalls of their mouths, lures of their looks to make,
And of their tresses grinnes, long billing birds to take:
They see the ambitious then Tantalus more vain,
Contentment shoue away, and catch thereat again,
And on self intrailes gnaw: they see the envious
More cruel, then Jove's Eagle was to Titius:
Gluttons with their own hands their own throat bole to cut,
And covetous for sin their corpse to penance put.
Of the contentious, some they so frantic see,
That souls they venture to damning, if killed they be,
Necks to the rope their house to wrack, if foe they kill,
Whom dead redeem with kissetaile price they gladly will.
Others of like angry, but not so hardy heart,
Bequeath to folly of their will so large a part,
That rather then at home with equal neighbor bear,
Abroad the'^le roue, and ride, and toil, and toss and tear,
And guild with guilt some puppet rakte from channel so,
That this late worshipped Idol shall them overthrow*
Courtiers (favre decked sepulchers) he sees to spread
About their Sovereigns a net, that covered,
Their vanities may seem: but fishers it they cast
From their full stored sea, to draw some gain at last.
Gentry he sees (like hosts) their houses gaylie dress,
Which (they too kind swept out) Usurers may possess*
Wan scholars eating paper, drinking inck, which they
Like Bees disgested up, in others bosom lay.
Farmers, distrusting God, each season chronicle,
(As nature doted) for an uncouth miracle.
Townsmen, consulting how they may the vpland expel,
And living private on their own, in the air dwell.
Artificers, their wits prentise to falsehood bind,
Mariners to a feast the fiends bid all arow:
Which ended, the poor scraps out to the saints they throw.
Lastly, he sees Hunters cancel their books of count,
Because th'expences their receipts so far surmount:
Faulkners, a purse of coin (too late repentant) send
About their Hawks necks tide, to an unknown friend:
Gamesters, through greedines undone, through fury drawn,
By oaths (nor ease, nor remedy) lay souls to pawn.
But he that thus surueied with controlling eye
Each others actions abroad, could not epsy
His own at home by far more vain, who left his bower,
His blessed bower, vnblist himself, to scale this tower:
For where, prince of his will, he in the garden rainde,
And senses him delights his senses entertainde,
Whilst curious eye made choice for his as dainty nose,
Of purple robed Violet, of blushing Rose,
Of snow white Flowre-de-luce, of golden Marygold,
Or rather marry-Sunne, and nose the place did hold,
Of taster for his mouth, of cheer heart Rosemary,
Dear Time, drowsy Lettice, and maiden Piony,
And morning dew, sweat of the precious stars, he drank,
And through the shadie green leaued arbours ietted cranke.
All this seemed naught, for he was naught, and with strait mind
Not so his own good ioyde, as at others repinde:
For seeing Alectrauemos vaunced so hie,
A Burgess him he deemed of the imperial sky;
His glittering vesture pure gold he imagines,
Imagines fond, for all not gold that glistereth:
And at direction of his crowing, him does seem
Mankind his actions, the Sun to guide his teeme,
Then pleader his desire, from ludge affection,
By witness of supposall, soon has sentence won,
That so great happiness out sole to be possessed
By the great worthiness, that sole did him reuest:
Which both united would so rare effects beget,
As world on wonder might, and heavens on envy set:
Then should equality plot down the lists of time,
And neither Phoebus chair so high the welkin clime,
As with rays perpendicular the earth to scorch,
And lend rest night to courtaile, ne his forceles torch
Of heat in the Ocean be quenched over soon,
Or darkness posting steps tread on the skirts of noone:
Then should not men in open light those prankes commit,
Which even blind night would grieve to see, as never fit,
Nor any slurging waste in drowsy bed the day,
Nor wear out hours of quiet at unruly play.
Thus on the sandy ground of vain conceit beguilde,
Frame of a common weal reformed, his facies build.
But as the male-contented subjects, grieved long,
As much with graste new favorites, as their own wrong,
By the unlawful means of joint rebellion,
Seem lawful end to seek of reformation:
But if the left side balance chance the right to ouerway,
And they prevail, their vizard soon aside they lay:
The erst but ragged state, is then in pieces rent,
And each to turn the dear bought victory is bent
To his best profit: so, when fortunes blast filling
The sails, did ship of his attempt to haven bring
Of his desires, pretended good he then forgets
Of others, and mind on his own he wholly sets,
How he may surest stablish his new conquered realm,
How of his glory fardest to derive the stream:
But if he sifting thus each shift his wits refinde,
There were against his drifts no less that counterminde.
For when the god of puffes, great master of the air,
Saw the base Snayle, of his sons spoils, a Trophee rear;
Choler enflamed his heart, revenge tickled his fist,
Disdain wrinckled his face, to smile of little list:
And up his throat bole stairs climbd words of threatening,
Which to effects of deeds thus wise he sought to bring:
Post through his large Dominions are writs out sent,
To warn his windy vassals to a parliament:
So, whizzing, blustering, peeping, whisking there came in,
First lithie Eurus with his parchie riuild skin:
Next Boreas armed in ice, weapon'd with shot of hail,
Then Zephurus, his robe purffled, with flowers entraile:
And Auster last with dropping beard and mistie head,
Dukes of great power, whom their retinue followed,
And with low beysance to their prince in his vast hall,
Some on his right hand, some on left themselves they stall:
AEole sits in the midst, and with dread grace holds
His toothed mace, a trebble death which menaceth:
Not Atlas mount, whose feet press down the fiends of hell,
And head pearcing the clouds, supports the Angels cell,
More lofty shows, his stature such, such is his state,
His sparkling eyes, blasen like Comets, which relate
To mankind dismal news, his voice like bull that tells
His late gores smart with bellowings, and bootles yels:
And thus through anger bitten lips his words he threw,
The whiles they turning mouths to ears attentive grew:
Oh you great children of the greatest heavenly fire,
Calde to possess your birthright by your drawing site:
But back repulst by middle brother of the air,
And with his thwarted side bard of near repair,
Whom wayles wandering thus, and to and fro tossed,
I gathred, stablisht, and with just laws ordered,
And of each quarter of the world great Lords you made,
Which with your swarmie Colonies out sent you shade,
And since often checks of Jove I bear with patient mind,
And pikes with fellow gods, and curses of mankind,
For slipping raines to your ill used liberty:
Lo now for these large benefits so liberally
Bestowde, one boon, one sole requital I require,
Your King it craves, who may command, stoops to desire:
My child, my dearest child, my child of heavenly seed,
My glorious vaunt, my hopes rare fruit, my travails meede,
Set on, fought with, wounded, (O hard success) subdued,
Helples, and near liueles, lies in his blood imbrued,
Whose hurts my wounds eke are, and who him conquered,
On me, your king, a god, so great god triumphed.
Revenge, revenge you then the sons foul injury,
The fathers bitter grief, and our bothes infamy:
Or if (unkind) my quarrel to revenge you slack,
See and revenge at least your own heel treading wrack:
For who will you regard, if you remain unknown?
Who can you strangers know, if first you be not shown?
Who will? who dares? who can you show? if thus wise rest,
Your Iudex vnrelieu'd, and vnreuengde be left:
Then shall the jolly Mariner, his vows due price
Returned, pay you no more with offered sacrifice:
Then the prescribing steale-toll Miller never shall
Wait on you with his linen wings and wheeling wall,
Nor ever shall just peized swimmers of the air,
Of your great force unwilling witness ravished bear:
But either you I know not, or I know full well,
Nor so small reake, nor so base thoughts in you to dwell:
You that your mother Earths void womb reuisiting,
And there against kind forclosde, bounsing, and rumbelling
For issue, so her vaulted entrails toss and tear,
That she new childing groans with pain, and quakes for fear:
You that from under Thetis feet the mite vprake,
And therewith smeere her face, and for your pastime sake,
To low depressed vales, and high stirring mountains,
Neighbors of heaven and hell, transform her watrie plains:
You that from coast to coast the clouds do hold in chase,
Till melting down in tears, conquered they yield you place:
Can you endure a creature of the inferior sort,
Void of discourse, a worm of so unworthy port,
As neither stature, beauty, strength, nor ought beside,
Can by pretense of seeming cause abbet his pride,
Your princes son, your foster-brother dare deprive
Of honor, state and life, and with you counterstriue?
Nay first let heaven and earth perish confusde in one,
Ere least jot minisht taint your reputation.
But why with needles words your needful deeds stop I?
My trusty mates, my only power, my chief rely:
Go you, go soon, go fast, in bud this mischief quail,
Ere he of settling time do you of speed prevail.
To quench this kindled fire, use force, use policy:
Let valor be your god, fortune and destiny.
From the usurped height him thrust and tumble down,
Let shame his onset let, let fame your atchieement crown.
These makebate breaths brookt not the patience to attend,
Until his tale were closed in a perfect end:
But from the folkmote rusht to broyle the sky, and band
Sharp fight against the great Realms both of sea and land,
And with waightier effect t'accomplish their pretense,
By set accord they feign a iarring difference,
And ranckt in facing troops they entershock amain,
Like stalworth Knights whose Iusts fair Ladies entertain:
But more impetuous were their brunts, which coupling wild
So rough a storm begat, as winter never child.
Like foul brought fourth, the altered heavens were ouerlayed
With mourning black, as in their limits should be played
A tragedy, for which a stage they began prepare,
And wherein they a part (too nighly-bowred) bare,
For with the thunders rore they cracking seemed to rip,
And burn with lightning flashes, which confusely skip.
But price and wager sole of their contention,
And naue where their spoakes fury met was Lymazon,
Of him they sore disdain, themselves despisde to see,
Against him their threats, their blows, their hurts all bended be:
So whilst in sea of bliss he sailed all aflaunt,
Of his good fortune proud, of his fate ignorant,
He sooner found himself in danger pressed to sink,
Then the tempest foresee, or change he could bethink:
Whence though of courage no such share he did possess,
But he some inward touch felt of dismaiednes:
Yet neither were his coward sprights depressed so,
But that he shamed his port should it too fully show,
And feign he would in equal peize of judgment rest,
As one that could despise the worst, yet hopte the best:
But hope was wan, and countnance vain, where earth and sky
Against his state, seemed linked in conspiracy:
For in th'ascendent balance Mars was faring back,
And Lady Venus detriment did threaten wrack:
Eke Saturn his ruler falling in house of foes,
Against his vassals good did his dire beams oppose,
And the earth quaking nodded with second ruin spire,
To throw him headlong down, if he would not retire,
Whom winds no way to escape, nor power to stay afford,
But him on foreship, quarter, stern (the whiles) aboard
Both voore and Auft do lay, so in pell mell to ruze,
And though his steps (like Lympet touched) he faster gives,
Yet him so long assail, so often they do surround,
That out at last a chinke to enter in they found.
Like as the rain enriched flood, which tumbling low
From the high mountains, menaceth to ouerflow
The fruitful plains, and make the fardest sea his gole,
If the blind pioner, or fostred rat, some hole
Him wimble through, then forced banck, the same does reame
To such a gaping gap, that at his mouth the stream
Out belks with rushing noise, till every furrow flote,
And husbandman to lost pains tunes a plainfull note:
Or as long delued oak, whose undermined root
Does purchase heavens sight, with many knocks to boot,
If once to shoulders shog he yield, is loosed more
And more, till on the bruised earth his length he skore:
So this small entrance won, the winds wedge wise in drive
Their blasts, and stitch by stitch his clibbie belly riue:
From the unloosed hold thus loses he his place,
And leaves the empty room a witness of his case:
Then down he falls, like shellfish up by Eagle borne,
That from the greater height he may the more be torn:
Then down he falls like dart from th'Eagles masters hand,
Whose fiery wings bears vengeance to th'offending land,
And with him fall his envy hate and surquedrie,
His hopes, his plots, his prankes, his joy and iollitie.
But who did fix a nail in Fortunes rolling wheel,
Whereon he headlong down past help began to reele,
And how he saved the game, thus driven to his trumps,
Let others write, my pen is worn to the stumps.
FINIS.
