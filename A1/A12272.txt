The two Loving Sisters:
Wherein the one to the other does show,
How Cupid in a Dream did her woo.
To a pleasant new Tune.


IT was my chance not long ago,
abroad as I was walking,
I heard two loving Sisters,
that secretly were talking;
The youngest to the eldest said,
why do thou not marry?
In faith (quoth she) I Will tell to thee,
I mean not long to farry.
When I was fifteen years of age,
then had I suitors many,
But like a wanton wily wench,
I would not sport with any:
Till at the last, sleeping fast,
Cupid came unto me,
And like a Lad that had been mad,
he swore that he would woo me.
Then he lay down by my side,
and laid his arms upon me:
But I being 'twixt sleep and wake,
did strive to thrust him from me.
But then he so kissed me,
as I was kissed never;
If he had never left kissing me,
I should have slept for ever.
Then he hugged and tug'd me so,
I could not get him from me,
But I with all the strength I had,
did thrust him who came on me:
For Cupid like a Suitor bold,
did use both time and leisure,
And in the circle of his arms,
enchanted me with pleasure.
Then me thought the world run round,
when Phoebus fell a skipping,
And all the Nymphs and Goddesses,
came round about to strip him,
Neptune lowred, and would have powered
his Ocean cup upon us,
But Boreas with his blustering blast,
did strive to thrust him from us.
Then limping Vulcan he came in,
like one that had been jealous;
Venus followed after him,
and swore she would blow the bellows.
Mars called Cupid Iackanapes,
and swore he would him smother;
Quoth Cupid then, did I say so,
when thou did love my Mother?
Me thought that Orphaeus with his Lute
stood at my bed side playing,
And Pan too with his oaten Flute,
did keep his Flock from straying:
And while that they did sweetly play,
in such a trance they laid me,
That to the pleasant Fields below,
I thought they had conveyed me.
Then Juno and great Jupiter,
came marching with Apollo,
Saturn came with Mercury,
and all began to hollow:
Cupid ran and hid himself,
and so of joys bereft me:
Then suddenly I did awake,
and all these fancies left me.
The second part. To the same Tune.


WEll Sister, I have heard your dream,
which much good does intend thee:
For I think Cupid now does mean,
with a husband to befriend thee;
And to entice you unto love,
which you held in derision,
Has sent you this same Dream, which may
be called Pleasures Vision.
Then Sister, I would have thee use
thy Suitors well hereafter:
And though our Father he be rich,
and thou his eldest Daughter,
Yet I do know you are in love,
for it is in vain to hide it:
O fie on this dissembling look,
I never could abide it.
Make use of time, it will away,
for beauty soon decays,
And she is out of date, they say,
that until twenty stays.
Then let us not be coy again,
these squemish tricks undo us,
But kindly let us entertain,
our Suitors when they woo us*
This peevishness does but prolong,
our Maiden grief and sorrow;
And we are older by a day,
when we do rise to morrow:
Then why should we in modesty,
our own desires thus smother,
Faith I do love a proper man,
and so too did my Mother.
Cupid is a waggish Boy,
and by your dream he showed,
That married couples happy be,
that are with love indewed;
But she that dies here a Maid,
and coyly does dissemble,
Shall afterward lead Apes about,
which makes my heart to tremble.
Although that I do counsel you,
who are my eldest Sister;
Yet if my tongue belie my heart,
I wish that it may blister:
For I confess, that when I first
to fifteen years attained,
To think that I had staid so long,
I oftentimes complained.
The eldest Sister hearing this,
unto her soon replied;
Good Sister, I your counsel like,
which shall not be denied,
For though that I have always been
so coy in outward carriage,
Yet being eldest, as it is fit,
I will take place in marriage,
The other Sister then replied,
quoth she, though I am younger,
Yet will I not in love give place,
for my desires are stronger:
And therefore since that both of us,
against our wills have tarried,
Like loving Sisters let us both,
upon one day be married.
FINIS.
