To the right Honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, Principal Secretary
to her Majesty, and of her Highness most Honorable Privy Counsel: And to
the godly and virtuous Lady, the Lady Vrsula his Wife: RICHARD SAINTBARB the
unworthy servant and minister of Christ, wishes great prosperity in this
life, with increase of grace and peace from GOD the Father, and life
everlasting through Jesus Christ our life and Redeemer.
MIght I not (Right Honorable) seem over bold, or might my presumption
therein be pardoned: I should not only then hold my self freed from one of my
chiefest cares, but also it would minister great joy unto my distrustful and
fearful mind. For now I rest doubtful to make your Honors defenders of
these my first fruits and simple labors: but I cannot on the sudden comfort
my timorous and weak spirit with possession of such your favors (and that it
were unmeet that good things should be hindered and buried for any particular
respect, I will reserve unto my self the hope of your good and godly likings:
and so as one who as well by the report of Gods dear children, both of
preachers and others, as in some measure himself has been made acquainted
with your holy and religious dispositions not only in sauouring good things
and the truth of the Gospel which is the power of God to salvation. Romans 1.16.
but also in furthering by all good and godly means the building up of the
beawtifull and precious house of God that the sanctified spouse of Christ
Ephesians. 5. might be edified and furthered in all sound knowledge and holy
faith. 2. Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8. I wholly therefore depend upon your favorable
acceptance of the cause I handle, which I doubt not, but thoroughly assure my
self it shall do great good in the Church of God: and bring singular profit
unto Gods dear Saints: and thus being resolved, that in regard thereof, your
Honors will vouchsafe to bear with my ras^nesse and weakness, and take to
your defense this godly treatise of the grounds and principal questions of
christian Religion: my proceeding wherein I leave to be censur^d by your wise
and sound judgments: little regarding the carping mate and curious reader
either of proud papist, secret Heriticke, dissembling hipocrite or blind
Atheist who never with godly reverence regard the truth of Christ, neither the
dividing of the word of God aright. And thus praying that GOD of his great
mercies will bless your Honors with all his good blessings, I humbly take my
leave.

Kingswood in Wilt. the 2. of September, 1589. Your Honors most humbly to
command in the Lord Jesus, Richard Saintbarb Preacher of Gods word.

To the christian Reader, grace and peace in Jesus Christ.
Dear Christians, if ever good David had just cause to cry out and say, My
eyes gush out with rivers of waters because they keep not the law. Psa.
119.136. If the same Prophets heart did tremble and shake for fear of Gods
judgments, when he saw the flowing wickedness of his time, and the heavy
hand of God for the same; for these are his words, Thou have trodden down all
them that depart from thy statutes: for their deceit is vain. Thou have taken
away all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore I love thy testimonies,
my flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments, Psalm.
119.118, 119, 120. Jf ever Lot, Jeremy, and the godly men that are recorded
in Ezekiel, had just cause to mourn and pine away with great grief and
zeal, in beholding the contempt and despising of Gods sacred law, and the
most abominable life of the people in their days. How much more may the
godly Ministers, and all good people weep and consume themselves away and
send forth every day fountains of tears, to behold, and continually to
see this our age and time, (which should be a most happy time for knowledge,
faith, and holiness of life, considering how long a season God has lent unto
us his holy word, and powered his benefits upon us) which are yet a most
crooked and stiff-necked generation: for the hearts of the people are not only
become hard and stony, but also their ears (as the Prophet Jeremy says) are
become uncircumcised, that they cannot abide to hear Gods word: yea it is a
reproach unto them, and they have no delight therein: Iere. 6.10. also how
sin abounds J need not to show: for this our land lies in sins, and is
frosen in the dregs thereof: Zephaniah, 1.12. Even so much that we justify
Zodama and Gomora, Ezeki. 16. for just and holy Cities: for such are the
sins of England, and so vile, that it may rather be accounted a polluted
Land, and a seat of iniquity: for (alack) how deeply is she sunken in the
sink of sin, and how abominably does she send forth every day more and
more all kinds of Pride, Whoredoms, Incests, Murders, Theftes, Covetousness,
Oppressions, Vsuries, Cursings, Periuries, Blaesphemies, and such like: in so
much that we may say with the holy and good Prophet Hosea, Hear the word of
the Lord ye children of Israel (yea rather ye children and inhabitants of
England) for the Lord has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land
because there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By
swearing and lying killing and stealing, and whoring, they break out, and
blood touches blood: Therefore shall the land mourn and every one that
dwells therein shall be cut off with the beasts of the field, and the fowls
of the Heaven, and also the fishes of the sea shall be taken away: yet let none
rebuke nor reprove other, for thy people are as they that rebuke the Priests.
Hosea 4.1, 2, 3, 4. and what is the fountain and cause of these evils and
rebellious transgressions: suerly infidelity and ignorance of Gods word (as
the good Apostle S. Paul affirms in these words). This I say therefore and
testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in
vanity of their mind, having their cogitation darkened, and being strangers
from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in the^, because of the
hardness of their heart, which being past feeling, have given themselves unto
wantonness, to work all uncleanness even with greediness. Ephesians. 4.17, 18,
19. I beseech you therefore dear brethren, and good Christians, by the mercies
of God, that ye give up your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to
God, which is your reasonable serving of God; and fashion not your selves like
unto this world, but be ye changed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may
prove what is the good will of God, and acceptable, and perfect. Romans 12.1, 2.
And this time of ignorance (as the same Apostle testifies) God regards not:
but he admonishes al men every where to repent. Act. 17.30. Again, Awake
thou that sleep, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light: wherefore be not unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians. 5.14, 17. That we being filled with the knowledge of his will in all
wisdom and spiritual understanding, may walk worthy of the Lord, and
please him in all things, being fruitful in all good works. Col. 1.9, 10. And
that this knowledge, faith, and fruitfulness in all good works may abound in
us, as the elect and deer children of God, let us diligently read the book of
god, and continually meditate on the same for the Prophet says. Blessed is the
man, that does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of
sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scorneful: but his delight is in the Law
of the Lord, and in his Law does he meditate day and night: for he shall be
like a tree planted by the rivers of waters that will bring forth her fruit in
due season: whose leaf shall not fade, so whatsoever he shall do, shall
prosper. Psalm. 1.1.2, 3. Now, for the common benefit, and better instruction of
Gods people and thy self: (christian reader) J have caused this little and
short treatise of christian points of religion, to be printed, and published:
and although, it be but small in volume, yet I doubt not, but if it be well
read and printed in mind, it shall minister great good, to further thy
knowledge, to confirm thy faith, and to increase true holiness in thee. And this
I dare promise thee, that there are some things handled in this Catechism,
both in matter and manner, which other Catechismes does not as once meddle and
entreat of, and other things, which are entreated of some in their books,
have J drawn in a brief method, for the benifit of the reader. And whereas
many things are yet in doubt among the multitude and great controversies do
rise by them, I have breefely, yet soundly opened the truth of them: finally
there is not that point, which I have entreated of, but I have first defined
the same, and have set down the definitions, of all the hardest words, which
are commonly used by the preachers of the word, and in the large and great
volumes of the learned; that the simple, who is altogether ignorant of the true
sense of them, may understand, not only the Preacher and books, which they
both hear and read, but also the very words as justification, sanctification,
grace, redemption, law and such like. Therefore seeing my purpose is only to
do good unto Gods Church, and my pain great herein, yet godly, I hope all
faithful people will accept the same and both praise God for this little work,
and pray unto God for me, to increase his good gifts and graces in my soul
unto my lives end. Amen. Thus I take my leave from my house at Kingswood the
second of September.

Thine in the Lord, Richard Saintbarb, Preacher of Gods word.

Certain points of Christian Religion.
Question.

INto what faith were thou baptized?

Answer.

Into the faith of the holy Trinity. Matthew. 28.19.

Question.

What do thou mean when thou say, thou art baptized into the faith of
the holy Trinity?

Answer.

It is to enter and consecrate the baptized, into the faith and religion of one
God.

First, that they might believe the Father, the Son, and the Holy ghost, to
be one God; to whom alone, they must give their faith and confidence. Psalm.
37.5. Iere. 17.5, 6, 7, 8. John. 14.1.

Secondly, that they believe, that the son and the holy ghost, are nothing
else but the very essence of God. 1. John 5.7.

Thirdly, that they confess God the Father who has adopted them, God the
son by whom they are redeemed, and God the holy Ghost, by whom they are
sanctified and confirmed. Gala. 4.4, 5, 6. 1. Corinthians 6.10, 11.

Question.

Where shall we find the sum of this faith of the holy Trinity.

Answer.

First, generally at large in the holy Scriptures, which is called the Book
of God.

Secondly, particularly and briefly in the Articles of the Faith, called the
Apostles Creed.

Question.

Why is it so called?

Answer.

For two apt causes.

First, Because it is a brief collection of the Articles of the Faith, which
have been always in Christ's Church.

Secondly, because it was taken out of the pure doctrine of the Apostles.

Question.

Why must every christian say I believe, and not We believe; as well as they
generally do say Our Father which art, etc.

Answer.

First, because every Christian must be saved by his own faith, and not by an
others.

Secondly, whereas we say, Our Father, we must note, that it is a prayer: and
the other the belief of every Christian, and therefore a plain and great
difference, Haba. 2.4. Ga. 3.11. Heb. 10.38, 39.

Question.

Why must we believe, that there is a Church, and not in the Church, as in God
the Father, etc?

Answer.

It were great idolatry, to put our trust in mere man; for Faith only
belongs to the holy Trinity: and although Jesus Christ who is salvation it
self, is no where to be found but in the Church; yet Salvation is not of the
Church, and therefore Jeremy accurseth them that put any confidence in the
flesh of sinful man. John 17.1, 2, 3. Matthew. 28.19. Ierem. 17.5, 6. Esaias,
30.1, 2, 3, 4. and 31.1, 2, 3, 4.

Question.

Into how many points shall we divide this confession of our faith?

Answer.

Into 3. The first concerning God the Father, in the first Article.

The second, concerning God the Son in the six next Articles.

The third, concerning God the holy Ghost in the five last Articles.

Question.

How many things learn you in the first article? I believe in God the father
Almighty, etc.

Answer.

First, what God is.

Secondly, how he created all things.

Thirdly, how he preserves all his works.

Fourthlie, how he rules and governs all things.

Question.

What is God?

Answer.

God is a spirit, infinite, everlasting, unchangeable, incorruptible,
immortal, most simple in nature; in power most mighty, incomprehensible both
in greatness and Majesty, (by whom all things were made in the beginning of
nothing) also distinguished into three persons: the Father, the Son, and the
holy Ghost. John 4.24. Esaias 66.1, 2. Esaias 40.28. Mal. 3.6. Iam. 1.17. Romans
1.23. 2. Tim. 1.17. Genesis 17.1. Romans 11.33, 34, 35, 36. Ier. 10.10, 11, 12, 13.
Matthew. 28.19. Revel. 15.3, 4.

Question.

What is God the Father?

Answer.

He is the beginning and Author of every thing both in heaven and in earth.
Who, when it seemed good unto his divine Nature, created all things of nothing,
in heaven and in earth, both spiritual and corporal, and ordered them by his
eternal Son: the which are now governed and maintained, by the infinite and
consubstantiall power of the Holy Ghost, proceeding from them both from all
eternity. Genesis 1.1, 2, etc. Gene. 2.1. Proverb. 8.14, to the end. Psalm
114.30. Gene. 1.2. John 15.26. Roman. 8.9.

Question.

What is the Son?

Answer.

The Son of God, is Jesus Christ, who was begotten of his Father before all
worlds; and of his Father (without a mother) by whom all things were created:
who (being appointed of his Father from everlasting to redeem his elect
people) was (when the fullness of time was come) borne of a Virgin, and became
man of his mother (without a father,) by whom we are saved Psalm. 2.7. Hebr.
1.5. John 1.14, 18. Col. 1.16, 17. Reuela. 13.8. 1. Peter 1.19, 20. Galath.
4.4, 5. Luke 1.26, 27, 30, 31. Luke 2.6, 7.

Question.

What is the Holy Ghost?

Answer.

The Holy Ghost is the essential power and virtue, both of the Father and the
Son, eternal and consubstantiall with them: in whom, he rests and
abides; and from whom, he proceeds: By him, are we grafted into the body of
Christ, and sanctified, and sealed up to salvation. John 15.26. Luke 11.20.
Genesis 1.2. 1. cor. 12.13, 14. Tit. 3.5.

Question.

In that thou say, there is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost: what do thou else, but make three Gods?

Answer.

No, not so: for God is one in essence, and simple in nature, although three
Persons distinguished out of the same Being of Beeings. Deuter. 6.4. 1. Corinthians. 8.6. Ephesians 4.5, 6. 1. John. 5.7.

Question.

How prove you this distinction of the three Persons in the one Godhead?

Answer.

This may be proved most plainly and firmlie by these places of Scripture,
Matthew 3.16, 17. and 28.19. 1. John 5.7. Romans, 8.9.

Question.

Are they three several substances, in that they are three distinct persons?

Answer.

No: for I have already said, that they are but one, imcomprehensible,
infinite, invisible, and vndeuidable substance, and yet three Persons.

Question.

How are they three Persons?

Answer.

In respect of their properties, and not in dividing their nature, but in
distinguishing their properties.

Question.

What are their properties?

Answer.

We attribute to God the father, our Creation: to God the son, our
redemption: and to God the holy Ghost, our sanctification: to the father, the
thing done; to the Son, the wisdom whereby it is done; to the Holy Ghost,
the effects of the thing done. Genes. 2.7. Titus 2.14. 1. Peter 1.2. Acts
14.15. Proverbs 8.22, to 32.

Question.

What things are proper to the Father alone, that agree neither to the Son,
nor to the holy Ghost?

Answer.

This: the begetting of the Son; for which cause, he is called the Father,
and fountain of the Trinity. John 3.16. 1. Cor. 8.6. John 16.28. and 15.26.

Question.

What is given to the Son, that is not likewise given to the Father, nor to
the Holy Ghost?

Answer.

To be begotten; for which cause he is called the Son, and second person in
the Godhead; as also, that he is the Fathers word. Hebrews 2.5. 1. John 4.9.
Matthew 28.19. John 1.1.

Question.

What is proper to the Holy Ghost, that is not likewise given to the Father,
nor to the Son?

Answer.

To be proceeding from the Father and the Son, and to be the third person in
Trinity. Romans 8.9. Matthew. 28.19.

Question.

Then Jesus Christ was not created, in that he was the Son of God?

Answer.

No verelie: but begotten from everlasting, and without beginning: Also in that
he is God he is the Creator, and not a creature: for, by him all things were
made. Reuelat. 1.8. Mich. 5.2. John 17.5. John 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Coloss. 1.16,
17.

Question.

Was Jesus Christ created, in that he is man?

Answer.

Yea: he was created of God without the help of man, only by the work and
operation of the holy Ghost, in the womb of the virgin Marie. Matthew. 1.20.
Luke 1.35. Galath. 4.4.

Question.

In that thou give Jesus Christ two Natures, what dooest thou else but make
two Christ's?

Answer.

No: Although we say, that in Christ there be two natures, as divine and
humane; yet we make not two Christ's, nor two persons, but one person, and one
Christ; consisting of two natures. Matthew. 1.21, 23. Romans 1.3, 4. Luke. 1.43.
Romans 9.5.

Question.

Is Jesus Christ, as he is man, the Son of God?

Answer.

No verelie: not in that he is man, but in that he is God: and he is the Son
of man, and so called, in that he is man. Luke. 1.35. Matthew. 26.64.

Question.

Yet there is but one Son of God, as there is but one Christ.

Answer.

It is most true: There is not one eternal and natural: and another created
and adopted; but that only eternal Son of God, who sustaineth and
vpholdeth, the nature united to himself. Yet must we note, that we call the
person of Christ; the Son of God manifested in the flesh. 2. Tim. 3.16.

Question.

Then, is it thy meaning, that the humane nature of Christ is a person.

Answer.

No: for Christ's humane Nature, was never extant or had being, but in the
Godhead: wherefore the humane nature in Christ, is not a Person; but the
humanity subsisteth, and has his being in the person of the Word, and
therefore Christ is not either in imagination, or in deed, a double Person;
but one Person consisting of two Natures. John. 1.14.

Question.

What is the personal union?

Answer.

It is the taking of man's nature, which is sustained and vpholden of the divine
nature (that is to say) such a taking or uniting, that there proceeds or
comes out of that uniting, but one subsistence one being only; in which
subsistence that divine nature (that is to say) the person of the Word,
bears swaie and rules. 1. Ioh. 1.1, 2, 3. Romans 1.3, 4.

Question.

Yea: but he is also called the Son of God in that he is God and man.

Answer.

It is true: but not naturally in respect of his manhood, but by reason of the
Personal union, with his divine nature.

Question.

Proceed unto the Holy Ghost: and tell me, is he created, or begotten?

Answer.

Neither: but proceeding from the Father and the Son, of the same substance
and being with them: equal with the Father and the Son in glory and
majesty, and from all eternities, as in the definition it was showed.

Question.

Yea: but it should seem, that the Father should be greater than the Son:
and the Son greater than the holy Ghost, because the one is placed before
the other.

Answer.

Not so: For although the Father is put before the Son in order, and the
Father and the Son before the Holy Ghost; yet it is not because the one is
greater than the other, or more excellent than the other: but because the Son
was begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and
the Son. Otherwise we shall read first, how the Son is put before the
Father, 2. Cor. 13. And also how the Spirit is put in the first place 1. Corinthians. 12. Whereby we may note, that the order of names does not make
difference of dignities.

Secondly they be one in essence and substance. 1. John. 5.7.

Thirdly, that which is given to the one is given to the other in gifts and
working, John 5.21.26.27. 1. Cor. 12.4. to 12.

Question.

Then there is but one nature of God?

Answer.

It is most true: and that vncorrupt, infinite, unbegotten, neither divided by
place, nor included in any place, nor secluded out of any place, nor defiled
by person or place, neither subject to change. Romans 1.23. 1. Tim. 6.16. Psalm.
139.7. to 14. Esaias 46.10. Iam. 1.17. Deuteronomy. 32.4. Psalm. 5.4.

Question.

Now show me what is a person.

Answer.

A Person is a subsistence in the Essence of God: which being referred unto the
rest, is distinguished by a certain incommunicable property, or which is not
common to the other.

Question.

Then a subsistence is another thing than an essence?

Answer.

It is true: for if the Word were simply God, and had nothing proper severally
to it self: then had the holy Evangelist John said ill, when he said: The Word
(which he afterward calls God) was with God. John. 1.2, 3.

Question.

What is the use of this deep mystery.

Answer.

We are taught hereby: First, how we ought in all divine wisdom and godly
humility, to reverence this deep and holy mystery of the Trinity (the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost) and yet but one God in being and
glory, contrary to the opinion of Sabellius.

Secondly, how Christ was both God and man.

First, God from everlasting, and begotten of his Father before all times,
contrary to the heresy of Arius, John. 1.1, 2. Micah. 5.2. Revel. 22.13.

Secondly, Man when the f^^nes of time was come, by taking flesh of the Virgin
Marie: not bringing the same from heaven from the Father, and so afterward
swallowed up of the Father, and became al one with him, as Marcellus the
heretic affirmed, also renewed by the Anabaptists. Romans 1.3, 4. Gal. 4.4. Heb.
2.16.

Thirdly, that the holy Ghost is God with the Father and the Son, of the same
being and glory from all eternities, Gene. 1.2. Esaias 48.16. Math. 12.32. 2.
Cor. 5.19. contrary to the heresy of the Macedonians, who denied the Divinity
of the holy Ghost.

Fourthly, it teaches us to pray unto Almighty God, and search after true
wisdom and understanding; that we may both be led into the true mystery, and
avoid al heresies herein. Matthew. 7.7.

Question.

Now let us proceed unto the second point of the division: namely of the
creation of the world, tell me what order will thou observe herein?

Answer.

This, first of creation generally.

Secondly, of creation particularly.

Question.

Let us then come to the first, was the world without beginning.

Answer.

No: for it was created, although the philosophers did dream the contrary.
Genesis 1.1, 2. and 2.2.

Question.

Who created the same.

Answer.

Almighty God, by his wisdom and power. Genesis 2.1, 2, 3, 4. John. 1.1, 2, 3,
4. Proverb. 8.

Question.

What is creation?

Answer.

Creation is that action of God, whereby he created and made of nothing, all
things, both Heaven and earth, and whatsoever is contained in them, when that
there was none of them. Genesis 1.12. Psalm. 33.6. Iere. 10. Acts. 14.15. John.
1.1, 2, 3.

Question.

Were they created such as they be now? Or in what estate where they created
at the first?

Answer.

Touching their nature it is all one, but the qualities and conditions of them,
are marvelously altered and changed: for whereas now we see them subject to
vanity, they were not so then, but created very good and perfect, for that
the work did sufficiently preach and set forth the glory and cunning of the
work man, as it is plainly set down in the book of Genesis thus: The Lord
saw all that he had made, and it was very good. Genesis 1.31.

Question.

How came this ruin and confusion to the creatures, which were created perfect
by God?

Answer.

Only by the Apostacy and fall of man, who was appointed of God to be Lord
and ruler over the whole world, and all the creatures thereof. Gene. 3.17.18.
Romans 8.20.

Question.

Were all creatures that are now moving and growing upon the earth, then made?

Answer.

No: for God in his justice, to punish the fall and apostacy of Adam and
mankind (yet just and good in God, did cause the earth to bring forth
(thorough corruption) many noisome and corrupt creatures (since the six days)
which were not created at the first: for it is said, that all the works of God
were very good. Genesis 1.31.

Question.

How proouest thou that such noisome creatures, were created after the fall of
man, and for his punishment?

Answer.

By the words of GOD, which the holy servant of God Moses rehearses in Gene.
3.17, 18. Cursed be the earth for thy sake, thorns also, and thistles shall it
cause to grow unto thee, etc. ^o that whatsoever corrupt things do grow and
proceed from corruption, they are not the natural fruits of the earth (as
reckned in the order of nature) but corruptions, and of corruptions, which have
their original of sin: as lice, fleas, flies, frogs, toades,
catterpillers, grasshoppers, spiders, briers, thistles, and such like noisome
and hurtful creatures.

Question.

Shall the heavens and the earth be consumed, (because the Elements, the Air,
and the earth, are corrupted by corruption) in their substances, at the day of
Judgment, and so a new heaven, and a new earth created?

Answer.

No: but they shall be renewed and purged from their corruptions, which the
sin of man brought into the world.

Question

Yea, but it is written by S. John, that GOD will make a new Heaven and a new
earth, and that the first Heaven and earth shall fleet away from before him,
and their place shall be no more found. Revel. 20.11, 12.

Answer.

Saint John's meaning is not, that there should be a new Heaven and a new
earth, in respect of new, and other substances then they were before; but when
Christ shall appear, he shall chase away, and purge all the corruptions of
the Elements and the earth, with his purging and pure fire. Heb. 1.11. 2. Pet.
3.12, 13.

Question.

What other proof have you for this thing?

Answer.

This: the holy Ghost will not be against himself; for he shows by his
Apostle, that the heavens and the earth shall be restored, and purged from all
corruption; but yet in their substances to remain. Roma. 8.19, to 23. Acts
3.21.

Question.

Rehearse the words of the first place?

Answer.

For the fervent desire of the creature (says the Apostle Paul,) waits when
the sons of God shall be revealed, because the creature is subject to
vanity, not of it own will, but of him which has subdued it under hope,
because the creatures also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
into the glorious liberty of the sons of God: for we know that every
creature groneth with us also, and traueleth in pain together unto this
present, and not only the creature, but we also. Romans 8.19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

Question.

What gatherest thou out of these words?

Answer.

First by this word Creature, is meant all creatures, that live, move, and
grow, upon, in or under the earth, both senceles and sensible, living and
without life; and not only Angels, men, or devils; and therefore the Apostle
says every Creature.

Secondly, the Apostle says, that they weight for the glorious liberty of
the sons of God that they also might be not destroyed, but delivered from the
bondage of coruption.

Thirdly, he says, that they are subdued under hope, namely of restoration
to that excellent estate that they had by creation.

Question.

Proceed to your second place of proof?

Answer.

Whom the Heavens must contain until the time that all things be restored,
which God had spoke by the mouth of all the holy Prophets since the world
began. Acts 3.21.

Question.

What gather you by these words?

Answer.

That al things shall be restored to an excellent perfection, and therefore S.
Peter calls the day of Judgment, the day of restoring of al things: which
could not be attributed unto that day, unless that there should be a
restoration of them.

Question.

To what end or what uses, shall they serve after the day of Judgment?

Answer.

That is a wicked curiosity, to search after those things which God has not
revealed unto us: let us therefore say with Moses, The secret things belong
unto the Lord our GOD: and the things revealed unto us and our children for
ever, that we may do all the words of this Law. Deu. 29.29. and so avoid
likewise, such vain questions as these: whether they shall be perpetual or
not perpetual, for uses or not for uses; for they breed but strife and mere
babbling. 1. Tim. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. Titus 3.9.

Question.

What is the use of this point?

Answer.

First, how all things were created of God most perfect and good at the first;
and he therefore holy and just in his works. Psalm. 145.10, 11. Deuteronomy. 32.4.

Secondly, how our sin was the ruin and confusion of the perfection and
excellency of the creatures in their first creation: so that hereby we may see
how horrible and filthy a thing sin is: and therefore so much the more to
hate the same. Gene. 4.11, 12. Ephe. 2.2, 3. Col. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.

Thirdly the justice of GOD in punishing sin; and therefore we ought to kill and
fly from the same, as the only enemy of our health and salvation. Psalm. 5.4,
5, 6. Co. 3.5, 6. To. 6.23.

Fourthly, how all things in Christ, shall be restored to health and the
former excellency; but man to a greater excellency, and more perfect happiness
than at the first. Romans 8.14. to 26.

Question.

As we have hitherto entreated generally of the creation of the world, with
all things therein: so now more particularly let us come to the making and
creating of man: the which is the second point, and tell me what order thou will keep herein.

Answer.

First, who made man.

Secondly, whereof he consists.

Thirdly, of his excellency in his first creation.

Fourthly, of his fall.

Fifthly, how we come to the knowledge thereof and our sins.

Sixthly, of the uses of the law and good works.

Question.

Who made man?

Answer.

God.

Question.

What things may we consider in God, in the creation of man?

Answer.

First, his wisdom. Psalm. 104.24.

Secondly, his power.

Thirdly, his goodness. Psalm. 8.

Question.

Let us come to the second thing: What is man, and whereof does he consist?

Answer.

Man is an excellent and reasonable creature, created after the image of God
his creator consisting of two parts. Gene. 1.26, 27.

First, a soul. Gene. 2.7.

Second, a body. Eccle. 12.7.

Question.

What is the body.

Answer.

A wonderful Creature of the workmanship of God, framed out of the dust of
the earth, and of a notable proportion in every part; made upright, to look
upward always to God his maker. Gene. 3.19.

Question.

Although the body be of the dust of the earth, is it not yet more excellent
than all other creatures that were made of the earth?

Answer.

Yes verelie: and that first, in respect of the time of his creation.

Secondly, of the form of his creation.

Thirdly, of the end of his creation.

Fourthly, of the person of the Son.

Question.

1 How in the time of his creation?

Answer.

When the Lord made man, he first took counsel of his wisdom and power,
and deliberated on the matter: but when he made all other creatures (before he
made man) he said: let it be done, and it was done presently, not taking
such deliberation on their Creation, although his wisdom, power and glory may
be seen in them. Genesis 1.26. Roma. 1.20, 21. and 11.36.

Question.

2 How inform of his creation?

Answer.

God made all other creatures to go groueling on the earth, and to look
downward, but he made man a straight body to go upright; and always to look
up into Heaven, and so to consider of his Creator: also, he has planted a
certain Majesty in the face of man, to the terror of all other creatures.
Gene. 1.28, 29.

Question.

3 How in the end of his creation?

Answer.

First, in glorifying GOD in holy words, and also in good works. Ephesians
4.29, 30. Matthew. 5.16.

Secondly, in respect of the redemption of the body thorough Christ, to be the
child of God and heir of eternal life and salvation. To. 18.7.

Thirdly, to be the temple of the holy Ghost. 1. Cor. 3.16. and 6.19.

Question.

4. How in the person of the Son?

Answer.

In that Christ the son of God, has only communicated with man, in taking
to himself man's nature. Heb. 2.16. Romans 1.3.

Question.

What has man to consider in that his body is made of the earth and advanced
to such glory?

Answer.

First, it beats down all pride. Iere. 22.29.

Secondly, his brittlenes is showed therein. Isay 40.6, 7, 8. Job. 14.1, 2.

Thirdly, it teaches man to consider his excellency in Christ, and not to
defile (in sin and uncleanness of life) his body. 1. Cor. 6.15, to the end,
2. Cor. 6.14, to the end.

Question.

What is the soul?

Answer.

It is an immortal and spiritual substance created of GOD, and infused into
the body, which quickneth and gives life thereunto: and of it self never
dies. Eccle. 12.7. Job. 10.12. Matthew. 10.28. Reave. 6.9, 10, 11.

Question.

What are the powers of the soul?

Answer.

Principally two?

First, reason. Esaias 29.9. 1. These. 5.23.

Secondly, will. Heb. 4.12.

Question.

Are they perfect in us?

Answer.

No: but most imperfect. Genesis 6.5. Ier. 17.9. Matthew. 15.19, 20. Romans 8.7. 1.
Cor. 2.24.

Question.

Were they so created in us?

Answer.

No: but we got corruption by the fall of our first parents, Adam and Eve. Genesis
3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 2. Cor. 11.3.

Question.

Thou say that the soul is a spiritual substance: but there are some that
do affirm, it is but a motion, other some, to be a vanishing breath?

Answer.

The Scripture teaches the contrary, for

First, God is called the father of the spirits. Heb. 12.9.

Secondly, Christ is called the pastor of souls. 1. Pet. 2.25.

Now if these sentences shall be applied to motions, and a vanishing breath;
thereby to make God a Father, and Christ a Pastor of a thing of naught, it
were most wicked and absurd.

Thirdly, the soul is subject to torments, and capable of joy in this world,
and in the life to come: which things cannot be applied, to motions and a
vanishing breath. Luke 16.24, 25.

Fourthly, it should than follow, so many motions, and breathes (seeing they
have no being) so many souls.

Question.

In the definition it is said that it never dies, but always lives and is
immortal, but there are some that affirm, that it sleeps, other some that
it dies with the body?

Answer.

That it neither sleeps, nor yet dies, but that it always lives and is
immortal: and that either it goes unto bliss or misery presently after the
separation of the body; proved. Eccl. 12.7. Mat. 22.31. Luke 16.24, 25. Reu.
6.9, 10, 11.

Question.

Also it is said in the definition, that it is created of God, and by him
infused into the body, but there are some that hold, that the soul begets
the soul?

Answer.

First, these testimonies of holy Scripture do sufficiently prove, that they
are created of God, and powered by him into the body. Eccles. 22.7. Psalm.
33.15. Job. 10.9, 10, 11, 12.

Secondly, it is against the nature of a being, to be divided and parted.

Thirdly, to say yt a soul has seed and generation, is a hard and strange
kind of divinity.

Question.

The Apostle Paul, divides man into three parts, the spirit, the soul, and
the body: so that he seems to make the spirit one thing, and the soul
another: how is it then, that you divide man into two parts, the soul, and
body? 1. These. 5.23.

Answer.

The Apostle divides the soul into two parts, the first is reason and
understanding, which he calls the spirit; the second is will and affection,
which he calls the soul: so yt the spirit is not a several substance, but
the soul and spirit are one, even as the body and flesh are one.

Question.

Now let us come unto the third point, as thou have showed that God made man;
so tell me did he make him perfect and free from all sin?

Answer.

Yea: for it is said, that God did make him in the image of God. Gene. 1.27.
Eccles. 7.31.

Question.

In that Moses brings forth God speaking after this manner, let us make man
in our image, did he speak unto Angels, or the earth?

Answer.

No verily, neither to the one nor to the other, for

First, what fit counselor is the earth which is a dead Element.

Secondly, to ascribe such a notable work as the creation of man, or the least
part thereof unto Angels, is blasphemy against God.

Thirdly, it is not said that man was created after the image of earth or
Angels, but in the image of God.

Question.

What is the true meaning of the words?

Answer.

God in that place, speaks unto his wisdom and power, showing thereby what a
notable creature man should be: also it is a notable place to prove the
Trinity of the persons.

Question.

Does Moses make any difference between Image and likeness in that he
rehearses them both?

Answer.

No verily, for by it Moses repeateth one thing with many words, to make the
same more plain, and drive the same more deeply into our hearts. Also in the
27. verse he names only the word Image, finally in the fifth chapter, the word
similitude he only uses, and makes no mention of the word Image.

Question.

Was that the image of God, in respect of man's form or substance either in
soul or body?

Answer.

No: for God has no such form nor substance for he is neither flesh, blood
nor bone, and although a spiritual essence, yet infinite, uncreated, and
incomprehensible. 1. Reg. 8.27. Job. 11.7, 8. and 26.6. to the end. Esaias.
40.12, 13. Romans 11.33.

Question.

Yea: but the Scriptures do attribute, head, eyes, ears, mouth, arms, and
such like things unto God? Psalm. 34.15, 16. Luke 1.51.

Answer.

It is true, but these things are spoken for our weakness, not that God has
such things as are attributed unto him: but by these things God does teach us,
and instruct us further, in his holy and unsearchable mysteries; and because
we are too earthly minded, therefore he by these things does lift us up to
more excellent things; otherwise God is a spirit, invisible, infinite, and
incomprehensible.

Question.

Also the Scriptures do say, that he breathed into him the breath of life, and
so made of him a living soul. This breath was of the substance of God: so the
soul is a part of God, and therefore his image.

Answer.

It is blasphemy so to affirm, for the soul was created of God, as the words
makes manifest: if it had been part of the Creator, then it could not have
been created; and what is this, but to make God subject to errors, sin,
blasphemies, afflictions and terrors, yea hell it self and the devil: for the
soul of man has been subject to these things, ever since the fall of Adam and
Eua. Genesis 6.5. Ier. 17.9. 1. Sam. 15.29. Ephesians. 2.2, 3.

Question.

Is it said, that man was created in the image of God, because Christ should
come who is the image of God?

Answer.

No: for Moses speaks of the present time, when God made man. Again, what is
this but to say, that man is an image of his image: and also that Christ should
be an image of himself, and of the holy spirit, which thing is absurd, and a
lying doctrine of devils. Genesis 1.26, 27.

Question.

How understand you these words of the Apostle in Coloss. 1.15. Who is the
image of the invisible God, the first borne of every creature.

Answer.

Those words do nothing belong to the proving of the former absurdities: but
the Apostle tells us, that God shows himself to be seen in his son
Christ (not in that he had flesh, head arms, eyes, etc.) but in his mercy,
wisdom, goodness and righteousness: for otherwise, God in his naked Majesty,
is invisible and incomprehensible, and by these words is proved against Arms,
the coessence and consubstantialitie of the Son with the Father.

Question.

There are some that hold, that the image of God, was in man in respect of
rule over the creatures?

Answer.

Their judgment is not right: for although the image of God did shine in some
part; yet this is not Moses meaning, when he says, that man was created in the
image of God; if it were, Adam should be created unto one image, and we
restored into another.

Question.

There are others that do affirm, that the image of God is in the soul, in
respect of the immortality: but as for true righteousness, holiness, and
wisdom, etc. they are but the properties of God, and not his image, and
therefore man is not said to be the image of GOD herein.

Answer.

They herein are greatly deceived, for

First, if it be only the immortality of the soul, then Adam has lost the
same: for he by his Apostacy, lost the image of God.

Secondly, if it be the only image of God wherein Adam was created, then is it
not the same image wherein all true Christians are now created; (as the
Apostle shows) which is, true righteousness and holiness: a thing too too
absurd. Ephesians. 4.24.

Thirdly, by this it should follow, that God has 2. images, which were great
blasphemy.

Fourthly, herein the lie is given to the holy Ghost: for he plainly affirms
by his holy Word, that Adam was created into the same image, which we are now
restored into by Christ.

Question.

But does not immortality represent the image of God in some measure.

Answer.

Yes truly in some part; but as I have said before, it is not Moses meaning to
call Man the image of God, only in that respect.

Question.

But true righteousness, and holiness, etc. are the properties of God?

Answer.

I grant the same: yet it is the image of God wherein man was created, and the
faithful now restored into through Christ.

Question.

What is this image of God wherein they were created?

Answer.

It is the natural conformity of the soul, and all the functions of it to
the law of God, whereby freely and voluntarily it inclines unto true and
perfect holiness and righteousness. Ephesians. 4.24. Col. 3.10.

Question.

Where was this image placed?

Answer.

In the soul, as the especial seat to rule all the powers thereof, to
perfect and faithful obedience. Ephesians. 4.23. Romans 12.2.

Question.

Wherefore was man created thus?

Answer.

To serve God his Creator in true righteousness and holiness. Ge. 2.16, 17. Lu.
1.75. Ephesians. 4.24

Question.

Why say thou, true righteousness and holiness?

Answer.

First, because the same must be in sincerity, Ioh. 4.24. Esaias 29.13. Matthew,
15.7, 8.

Secondly according to the truth of Gods Word: otherwise it is but counterfeit
and false. Deuteronomy. 4.2. Matthew. 15.9. Ioh. 4.24.

Question.

What is righteousness?

Answer.

It is a perfect rule of equity, which teaches us to give unto every man his
due, in word, deed, and thought. Leuitie. 19.11, 15, 35, 36. 1 Thessalonians, 4.6.
Math. 7.12. Romans 13.7, 8.

Question.

What is holiness?

Answer.

It is a reverent and holy obedience, in the worship of God, co^ioyned with a
sincere love of God; which proceeds from an effectual faith, in the
knowledge of God, his word, and works. 1. Sa. 15.22, 23. De. 6.5. To. 14.23.
2. Co. 4.13.

Question.

Let us come unto the 4. point, tell me, how fell we from this excellent image
of God?

Answer.

We fell through the deceit of Satan, and the willing consent of Adam and Eua,
from the image of God unto the image of Satan, which is sin, foolishness,
and all kind of blasphemies. Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1. Ioh. 3.8.

Question.

What were the means, which Satan used to bereave us of this image of God, and
our happiness at the first?

Answer.

Two: external, and internal.

Question.

What are the external?

Answer.

Three: First, the serpent, Genesis 3.1. Secondly, the forbidden fruit. Ge. 3.2,
to 6. Thirdly, the woman. Genesis 3.6, 7.


Question.

What are the internal?

Answer.

Three. First, infidelity. Genesis 3.3.

Secondly, ambition. Genesis 3.5, 6.

Thirdly, stubborn unthankfulness, Romans 5.19.

Question.

What has this fall brought us?

Answer.

It has wrapped us wholly in sin, and made us the children of wrath by
nature. Genes. 6.5. Psalm. 51.6. Job. 14.4. Matthew. 15.19. Ephesians. 2.2, 3.

Question.

What is original sin?

Answer.

It is the heritable corruption of our nature, which once was perfect in the
innocence of man, but by the fall of Adam it was corrupted; and by
propagation, this corruption is distilled into all the parts of our minds: so
that it makes us guilty of Gods wrath, and to bring forth nothing but the
fruits of the flesh. Romans 5.12.14. Gal. 5.19, 20, 21.

Question.

What is sin in general?

Answer.

Sin is every transgression of any of the Commandments of the law of God,
either in not doing them, or not doing them to their right end, or in not doing
them so willingly, and fully as the Law requires. Nehem. 1.7. 1. Ioh. 3.4.
Iam. 2.8, 9. Romans 7.7.

First, in soul. Matthew. 22.37, 39.

Secondly, in body. Matthew. 5.28. To. 7.7, 8.

Question.

What is it to be the child of Gods wrath?

Answer.

To be subject to the eternal curse of God, which is the due reward of sin.
Deuteronomy. 27.26. Gal. 3.10.

Question.

What is the curse of God?

Answer.

It is all the plagues that do belong either to the soul or the body, which
are comprehended in the whole book of God.

First, for this life. Leu. 26. the whole, Deu. 28. the whole.

Secondly, eternal perdition and damnation both of body and soul. Roman.
6.23. Matthew. 25.41.42. Revel. 21.8.

Question.

Then of our selves and the devil comes sin, and damnation?

Answer.

Yea verily; and of no other. Gene. 3.1, to 8. John 8.44. 1. John. 3.8.

Question.

Let us come to the 5. point: tell me, how shall we come to the knowledge of our
sin and misery?

Answer.

Only by the perfect rule of the holy and righteous law of God. To. 3.20. and
7.7. Gal. 3.19.

Question.

What is the Law?

Answer.

It is a most perfect rule, and a holy doctrine fined from all corruption, and
prescribed from God himself unto us; showing, what we ought to do, and what
not. Psalm. 12.6. and 19.7, 8, 9.

First, in respect of God. Matt. 22 37. to 40.

Secondly, in respect of our neibors. Matt. 22 37. to 40.

Question.

Does the word of God deliver all things, sufficiently for the perfection of
Christianity?

Answer.

Yea: and that in this sort. First, for the pure service of God, which is true
holiness. Deu. 13.32. Matthew. 15.9. John 4.24. Esaias 8.19, 20. Gal. 1.7, 8.

Secondly, for our salvation. John 5.39. Ioh. 20.30, 31.

Thirdly, for our sufficient righteousness unto men. 2. Tim. 3.16, 17.

Question.

May we not serve God after our own inventions and traditions?

Answer.

No verelie: for, first our understanding is blindness. 1. Cor. 2.14. Iere.
10.14.

Secondly, our wisdom is foolishness. 1. Cor. 1.20.

Thirdly, the same an enemy to the will and wisdom of God. Romans 8.7.

Fourthly, They are accursed that serve God with any other doctrine and
wisdom than his own. Gal. 1.8. Revel. 22.18, 19.

Question.

Where may we find a short sum of the will of God?

Answer.

In the ten Commandments: whereof the four first belong unto the first Table,
and the six last unto the second Table.

Question.

Wherefore was it given in two Tables, and not rather in one?

Answer.

First, it was to show a flat difference between the duty we owe to God,
and the duty we owe to our neighbors.

Secondly, that the first is more excellent, and to be preferred before the
second. Mat. 6.33.

Question.

Do they that break any commandment of the first, offend greater than in
breaking any of the second?

Answer.

Yea verelie: for the first belongs unto God and his service; and the second
to men, and their duties one toward another.

Question.

But out Savior Christ seems to make them equal when he says; Thou must
love God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, etc. This is the first and
greatest Commandment: and the second is like unto it, thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self. Matthew. 22.31, 38, 39.

Answer.

First, the latter is like unto the former, not in the excellency and
equality of matter: but because it has some affinity and agreement with the
first.

Secondly, because each of them teaches the true and perfect will of God.

Thirdly, as Love is the fountain of al those things, which belong unto God
comprehended in the first Table; even so the love of our neighbor, is ye head
of all those things which are due unto our neighbor, and is expressed in the
second Table. Mark. 12.29, 30, 31.

Question.

Wherefore is the second Table preferred before the first, as appears by Hos.
6.7. Mat. 9.13. and 12.13. if they be not equal in excellency?

Answer.

First, the Lord does thereby reprove hypocrites, which especially busy
themselves with the outward service of God; but (void of all piety, and their
manners alienated from all integrity) the fruits of charity and true
righteousness, is far from them. Mich. 6.5, 6, 7, 8. Hosea. 6.6. Matthew. 9.13.

Secondly, herein he notes his great care unto mutual love in us one toward
another, accounting it not to be his service and worship (although commanded)
if the duties that we owe to our neighbors be neglected. 1. Ioh. 3.15, 17. and
4.7, 8, 12. Esa. 58.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Question.

May not the two Tables be separated and plucked asunder?

Answer.

No verily, for they were joined of God together, and therefore not to be
separated Mat. 19.6.

Question.

What gather you thereby?

Answer.

First, that it is not sufficient for us only to have a civil honesty, and
busy our selves in the second Table; but also we must be religious and
exercise our selves in ye first table. Deuteronomy. 6.5. Ephesians. 4.24. Tit. 2.12.

Secondly, not only religious unto our God: but also we must practice the
second table; that is, to love our neighbor, and use honesty of life. Ephesians.
4.24.25. Titus 2.11, 12.

Question.

What if we do the one, and neglect the other?

Answer.

If we do the first and not the second, it is but an outward holiness, which
is hypocrisy. And to do the second and not the first, is but civil honesty,
which is mere Atheism: therefore the one must go with the other: that is,
true godliness and righteousness, and the second must proceed out of the
first, or else it is but a counterfeit righteousness. Iere. 7.4, 5, 6, 9, 10.

Question.

Why did he write them in stone, and not in parchment, or after some other
manner?

Answer.

First to teach us, that it serves for all ages, as a doctrine of continuance,
to be a perfect rule of righteousness. Psalm. 19.7, 8, 9.

Secondly to show us, that our hearts are stony, before they are softened by
the Spirit of God. Ezekiel. 35.26, 27.

Thirdly, that we must write them in our hearts, to be our instructers, and
counselors. Psalm. 1.2. and 119.24.

Fourthly, it tells us, that unless the Lord write them in our hearts, by the
finger of his hand, all is but vain. 2. Cor. 3.

Question.

Why was the Law given after so fearful a manner; as by thundrings,
lightnings, darkness, and shaking of heaven and earth?

Answer.

It was to drive, not only the Jews, but all other people of God unto the end
of the world, to have it, first in great reverence. Psalm. 19.9. Esaias 66.2.

Secondly, to hear it with great attentiveness. Eccl. 4.17. Matthew 13.9.

Thirdly, to practice it in all obedience. 1. Sa. 15. 22, 23. Iere. 7.23.

Question.

Why, would not we else regard the Law of God?

Answer.

No verelie: for such is the corruption of our nature, that those things which
are first, most easy; secondly, familiar; and thirdly, not carrying with them
a Majesty and power;
are contemned in our eyes: for which cause, God seeing the crookedness of our
Nature, did magnify both his Law and Gospel, with wonderful miracles, and
fearful signs, having fixed in them great power and sharpness, to terrify
and strike down the froward and rebellious. Mark. 16.20. Heb. 2.4. 2. Cor.
10.4, 5, 6. Acts 2.5, 9, 10. and 24.26.

Question.

By whom was the Law given?

Answer.

By the Angels, as the holy Apostle Saint Paul witnesses: wherein we may
see a notable commendation of the Law, to teach us al holy obedience. Acts.
7.39. Gal. 3.19.

Question.

Rehearse those commandments?

Answer.

God spoke these words and said, I am, etc.

Question.

Is the first (which is comprehended in these words, God spoke, etc.) a
commandment?

Answer.

No: but a preface or introduction to the law of God.

Question.

What learn you out of the same?

Answer.

First that God is the author of the law, and therefore the same to be obeyed
and loved. Ioh. 14.23. Psalm. 119.97.103.136.

Secondly, how it is spiritual, and therefore it teaches us to be
spirituallie minded. To 7.7, 14. Matthew. 5.28. John 4.24.

Thirdly, the might and majesty of God is set forth in the same to teach his
children to reverence him with fear, and to terrify the rebellious. Acts
5.5. Iere. 10.6, 10, to 14. Exodus 20.18, 19. Deuteronomy. 4.10.

Fourthly, the goodness of God is expressed, in the children of Israel, their
and our deliverance: theirs temporal and from a fleshly Pharao; but ours a
spiritual Pharao, the devil and the eternal bondage of hell: al which teach us
true thankfullnes. Exodus 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. cha. Ephe. 4.8. Heb.
2.14, 15. 1. John. 3.8.

Question.

What learn you in the first commandment, thou shall have no other Gods but
me?

Answer.

Fifthly, all the devils and unclean spirits.

Question.

Proceed to the first part?

Answer.

Those in heaven are.

First, Angels. Psalm. 81.11, 12, 13. Heb. 1.14.

Secondly, thunder. 1. Sam. 12.18. Exo. 20.18.

Thirdly, Winds. Number. 11.31. Iona. 1.4.

Fourthly, lightnings. Ier. 10.13. Exo. 20.19.

Fifthly, rain. Ier. 10, 13. Psalm. 147.8.

Sixthly, Snow. psalm. 147.16. and 148.8.

Seventhly, hail. Josh. 10.11.

Eighthly, Son, Moon, and stars. Josh. 10.12, 13, 14. Esa. 38.8.

Question.

Proceed to the second: that God rules all the creatures upon and in earth?

Answer.

Then to the moving creatures, as of one kind.

First al men generally. Pro. 26.1, 9, 7. and 20.24. Ier. 10.13. Psa. 33.16.
acts. 17.28.

Secondly, particularly of good and evil men: as, First, in all good actions.
1. Cor. 4.7. 2. cor. 3.4, 5. Iam. 1.17. Ephe. 2.9. Genes. 40.1. Secondly, in
their evil actions. Judge. 7.22. 2. cron. 20. Genesis 50.20. Thirdly, more
particularly, as: First, Princes, Psa. 6.15.7.8. Pro. 8.15. Secondly, Nobles
and Senators. Esa. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. Thirdly, Judges. Pro. 8.16. Fourthly,
subjects. 1. Sam. 10.26. Fifthly, enemies. Pro. 16.7. Sixthly, Wars both to
raise and cease. Judge. 9.23, 24.25. psalm. 46.9.



Then to moving creatures of other kinds, as: First, al manner of cattle, as
oxen, horses, sheep, etc. Genesis 2.19, 20. and 7.1. to 11. Secondly, lions. 1.
Reg. 13.24. Thirdly, bears. 2. Reg. 2.24. Fourthly, frogs. Exodus 6.12.
Fifthly, flies. Exodus 8.22. Sixthly, lice. Exodus 8.17. Seventhly worms. Joel

Tenthly, ravens and sparrowes. 1. Reg. 17.4.


Now for all creatures that grow, and are vnmoouable, having their being on, and
in the earth, I will touch them: but first beginning with the Earth it self:
for which this is my proof. Genesis 1.12, 13.

Secondly, trees. Matthew. 19.19, 20. Iona. 4.6, 7.

Thirdly, herbs, flowers, grass, and corn. Psalm. 104.14. Matthew. 6.28, 29,
30.

Question.

Proceed now unto the third point, and tell me how thou can prove that all
plagues and punishments come from God?

Answer.

The holy scripture shows, how that there comes no evil unto a City,
unless that God do send the same: it is he that kills and gives life,
and brings down unto the grave; he makes poor, and brings low: yea,
neither the pestilence, consumption, fever, burning ague, fervent heat,
mildeaw, sword, blasting, bocches, emeroides, scabbe, itch, madness, blindness, a
man's wife defiled, a man's house and vineyard taken away, dearth, famine,
captivity, grasshoppers and worms to destroy the fruits of the earth, hunger,
thirst, nakedness, to eat the fruits of the womb, and such like, nor any
else can happen, except the Lord send them: so that they neither come by
chance, or through oversight, or any other way but by Gods providence and
appointment. Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28. Exodus 8.9. and 10. chap. 1. Sam. 2.6, 7, 8.
Amos 3.6.

Question.

Proceed unto the 4. point: that God rules all the creatures in the sea.

Answer.

I will, and therein prove that he rules: First, the sea it self. Exodus 14,
16. Josh. 3.14, 15, 16, 17. Secondly, the fishes in the sea. Iona. 1.17. and
2.10. Matt. 17.27. Luke 5, 6, 7, 8. Thirdly, the fowls thereof. Genesis 7. and 8.


Question.

Proceed unto the 5. and last point, and tell me how ye prove that God rules
the devils of hell?

Answer.

I will effectually do the same: for,

First, these places of Scripture do affirm and prove his dominion and rule
over them, and of them. Job. 1. and 2. 1. Sam. 16.14. 1. Re. 21.20, to 23. Ma.
8.31, 32. Act. 16.18.

Secondly, if he were not tied by the power of God, he would soon destroy and
devour us. 1. Pet. 5.8.

Question.

Thou say, that God rules the planets, and the firmament, with all things
therein?

Answer.

It is most true.

Question.

Yea: but do they not serve for times and seasons, to rule and dispose man in
all his affairs, as sickness, health, life and death, and in all good luck and
bad luck besides?

Answer.

Far be it from all good Christians once to think so, but much more to
believe, and affirm the thing: for it is very sorcerie and soothsaying.

Question.

What else is it when Moses says, they are appointed for times, and seasons,
days, and years?

Answer.

It is most true that he says so: but he means nothing less than such a
cursed astrology: his meaning is only, for things belonging to natural and
politic order,

Question.

What meanest thou by this word, natural?

Answer.

Winter and summer, sowing time, reaping, planting, graffing, gardening,
mowing, and all tilling.

Question.

What meanest thou by this word, politic?

Answer.

The reckoning of years, days, and months, as some from the creation of the
world, some from Christ's incarnation, and some from one day, and some from
another.

Question.

Yea, but earthly things, and inferior bodies, have a kind of affinity and
kindred with the course of the stars, and so come by their disposition and
quality, and so may be told (because they are ruled by the^) what shall
become of them, and what things shall happen unto the^, by the planets, and
stars?

Answer.

Although it be granted, that there is such affinity and kindred; yet to
conclude therefore, that we may gather what shall befall unto man, either in
good luck or badde, health or sickness, life or death: and what qualities,
and disposition he shall be of, and what death he shall die, it is most wicked;
for these things belong only to God, and are most uncertain to men.

Question.

What reasons moves thee thus to think?

(...) These: first for ye one of their chiefest grounds is uncertain, as the
time of bearing to the time of conception; as:

First, it is a thing altogether impossible to have a certain knowledge of the
very time of begetting.

Secondly, the time of birth, is not only oftentimes sooner than it should be,
(thorough some occasion offered) but also through weakness of the woman, she
oftentimes, continues a longer time, or thorough long labor, she misseth
often times (not a minute) but hours, yea days; so that in the mean time,
there is a very great inclination, and moving of the heavens and Stars.

Secondly, seeing they that are borne at one minute and the self same instant
of time, are commonly altogether;

First, unlike in nature and manners.

Secondly, do die one before another, some one death, some another, some are
poor, and some rich, and some in authority, and some of low degree.

Thirdly, that the force of seed, which is the matter whereof the child is
begotten and bred in the womb, is greter than the force of Stars, concerning
the framing of man, to manners and nature; as we may see children to imitate
their parents in natural things; (seeing this, I say) it cannot be rightly
attributed to the nature of the Planets and courses of Stars.

Question.

What evils do they commit by these their southsayings, in attributing the
government of man unto the Planets, and constellation of Stars?

Answer.

First, if good luck hang upon the Stars, then our holy obedience unto God
does depend upon them too; for this is the proper cause of that; and so we
shall make the holy Ghost a liar, for he says; that every good and perfect
gift comes of God.

Secondly, if the kind of death, and evil luck (as they call it) do hang upon
the stars, then shall sin depend upon them too: for of sin comes all
punishments, which is altogether foolish and wicked to be so attributed, for
it comes of the devil and of our selves. Math. 15.19. 1. Ioh. 38.

Thirdly, they herein make the stars partakers of the divine nature and power
of God, in that they say they govern and bear rule over mankind, to direct
them in all their affairs, and life, and death. Job. 14.5.

Fourthly, in this, they both rashly enter into the secrets of God, and also,
as Gods they determine what shall come to pass.

Fifthly, they are deceivers, and bewitchers of the people that so teach, and
therefore God will set himself against them, and they are worthy to die the
death. Le. 20.6.27. Deuteronomy. 15.7. Esaias. 44.25. Mala. 3.5.

Question.

Can the devil and his inchanters, raise up winds, storms, lightnings and
rain, when, where, and against whom it shall please them?

Answer.

No verily: for it is the Lord only that has power of these things, for they
are in his treasure house, and at his beck and commandment, either to defend
and preserve his people, or to punish and destroy the wicked and reprobate.
Psalm. 104.4. Exodus 9.23, 24, 25, 26.

Question.

It is written in Job, that the devil did cause Lightnings, and raised up
winds? Job. 1.16, 19.

Answer.

It is true: but it was Gods permission: for when as God works by satan and
uses his service, the devil works by the lightnings and winds, and that by
the just judgment of God, to deceive and harden the hearts of the people,
because they will not believe and receive the truth: also herein, a notable
craft of satan may be seen, in that he conueyeth himself into winds and
tempests, thereby to make the world believe he is the author thereof: otherwise,
God is the author of all winds, tempest and lightnings, as we have already
proved. 2. These. 2.10.11.12.

Question.

What say thou of the inchanters of Egypt which did great wonders and
merueilous things?

Answer.

If the sequel of their actions, and their confessions be marked, we shall see
that neither they themselves, nor their great master satan, can do more than
God does give them leave.

Question.

Why? what makes thee so to say?

Answer.

The knowledge of these things: that,

First, they could not turn the dust into lice, as Moses did, but confessed
that it was the power of God. Exodus 8.17, 18, 19.

Secondly, they could not stand before Moses the servant of God.

Thirdly, when they had done their false miracles in show, they could not undo
them again. Ezod. 7.21. to the end and 8, 7, 8.

Fourthly, neither could they undo the true and powerful miracles of Moses,
but Moses himself, was feign with prayer to undo them. Exodus 8.12, 13. etc.

Question.

Why could not these incha^ters turn the dust into lice (as well as to turn
their rods into serpents, the rivers into blood, and to bring forth froggs) it
being a base thing in comparison of the other?

Answer.

First, in that they did the former things; it was by permission of God, to
harden the heart of Pharao, and to deceive him with his people, that they might
not let Israel go (without the mighty hand of God) to their own destruction.
Exodus 9.16. Romans 9.17.

Secondly, that the power of God in their destruction might be made known and
manifest, unto the whole world, and his faithfulness might be declared unto all
ages. Gene. 15.13, 14, 15, 16. Mica. 5.3, 4, 5.

Thirdly, that God might after a while in suffering them to do great miracles
in show, confound their wisdoms in base and vile things, that ye world might
see the falsehood and wickedness of inchanters and sorcerers Mal. 3.5

Question.

What think you of this opinion; that the devil and inchanters have no power,
upon that body or substance which is less than a barley come?

Answer.

I think the same to be most vain; and clean against reason, for if they have
power over great things, they have also power over small things: but not the
contrary; as because they have power over small things, therefore they have
power over great things: but in that they could not have power over the dust to
make lice, it was because, neither the devil nor his instruments, have power
of themselves, to do any thing, more than the will of God does permit and
suffer.

Question.

In thy proof of the definition of Gods providence, thou say that God
rules all the actions of men; not only the good, but also the evil: wherein
what else do thou? But make God the author of evil, which may not be?

Answer.

God forbid, we should say, that God were the author of sin: for there is no
evil with him, neither yet loves he wickedness. Psalm. 5.4. for perfect is the
work of almighty God, for all his ways are judgment: God is true without
wickedness: just and righteous is he. Deuteronomy. 42.4.

Question.

Why then? what do thou mean when thou say, that God rules the evil
actions of men?

Answer.

We say, that satan and our flesh, are the authors of sin, but yet on the
other side, we affirm according to the Scriptures, that even satan and the
wicked, are so bridled and ruled by the power and providence of God, that they
do not, nay cannot do that evil, when, where, and against whom they would;
for they all shall come to naught and to ruin, but what the Lords will and
appointment is, that comes to pass, whose will they execute in their wicked
doings. Job. 1. Gene. 50.20. 1. King. 13.4. 2. Sam. 17.14, 23.

Question.

Why? then God is the author of their sin, and they without fault?

Answer.

Nay not so, but he is most just and perfect righteous; and yet they, wicked
and unholy in doing the same.

Question.

How so?

Answer.

By reason of the diverse ends and purposes.

Question.

As how?

Answer.

God does it to set forth his glory, and to bring forth the malice of his
enemies, to show it to all the world, that he may be justified in his righteous
and holy judgments upon them: also to exercise his children by them and such
like: but the wicked and satan does the same of set malice, wilfully and
presumptuously against God and his saints, and not willingly, and obediently to
satisfy the counsel and purpose of God.

Question.

Can thou give me examples out of the Scripture for this matter? Where both
GOD and the wicked have dealt in the same action: so that God is said, to have
done that, which (notwithstanding) the wicked do?

Answer.

Yea verily: as

First, of Job, who confesses that his calamities come of the Lord: yet Satan
and the Sabaeans did work in this action. Job. 1.

Secondly, David; who confessed that God stirred up Shimei to curse him: yet he
did the same by the instigation of Satan, and of a malicious purpose. 2. Sam.
16.10, 11.

Thirdly it is said; that God did stir up David to number the people: yet it
is said in another place, that Satan provoked him. 2. Sam. 24.1. 1. Chro. 21.1.

Fourthly, it is said; that God sent into the mouths of the false prophets, a
lying spirit to deceive Achab: yet we may see, both the willingness of Satan
to lie and deceive: and also how the false prophets did most wilfully and
stubbornly maintain their lying prophecies. 1. King. 22.21, 24.

Question.

What say thou to the example of Christ in this thing?

Answer.

In this example we may see:

First, how he gave his son to death. Ioh. 3.16.

Secondly, how Christ did most willingly give himself to death. Ioh. 10.15.
and 13.12. Phil. 2.

Thirdly, how Judas his servant betrayed him for money. Matthew. 26.48.

Fourthly, how the Scribes, Priests, and Pharisees most gladly gave money, and
rejoiced therein. Luke. 22.5.

Fifthly, how Pilate delivered him to death for fear. John. 19.12, 13.

Sixthly, how satan sought the same, and brought it to pass by his instruments.
John. 13.27, 30.

Question.

Make this example more plain.

Answer.

In it we may see the rich goodness of God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ: of
God, in that he spared not his only Son: of Jesus Christ, in that he was
content in his own person to pay the ransom for the sins of his people; but
it was most wicked in the instruments, for they committed a horrible fact, in
murdering an innocent man, and in putting to death the Son of God.

Question.

But, did they it not for the same end that God did; namely, for the salvation
of his people?

Answer.

No verily: for as I said before, Judas did the same for money, the Scribes
and Pharisees for envy, Pilate for fear of Caesar, the Devil to take away all
hope of redemption and salvation; also to bring the murderers by his means
into the wrath of God, and so upon them destruction: therefore in either and
every of them was it wicked and worthy of condemnation.

Question.

What do thou conclude upon this thing?

Answer.

That GOD in all his actions is most just and clear from sin; and that the
wicked are most unjust: although they do nothing (indeed) but what God has
appointed them to do, nevertheless not to be excused therein.

Question.

If all things must come to pass as God has before appointed, is it not then
in vain to use counsel, labor, prayer, or any other means?

Answer.

If they be called vain things, because they can not procure things to fall
out, otherwise than God has appointed and decreed; they are vain indeed: but
otherwise they are not vain things but good means, by which (as instruments)
God brings his counsels, and purposes to pass: wherefore God does command
us to use them; and thereby (after a sort) we are said to be helpers to bring
his certain and everlasting purpose to pass.

Question.

As how?

Answer.

Thus: as God has certainly appointed, and undoubtedly decreed, how things
should come to pass, the time when, and the place where: so reserving the end
and event unto his secret counsel, (which we may not search into) he has
given us means (and also reason to use them) to bring things to pass: which
he has commanded us to use, leaving the issue, and that which is secret unto
him; wherefore not to do them, is to tempt God; as too much to trust in them,
is to distrust God: so that, both of them (not rightly performed) is great
wickedness against God.

Question.

What examples have you for this in the holy Scriptures?

Answer.

Our Savior Christ, although he was hungry and tempted of Satan, yet would
he not depend upon the mean, and use unlawful means to distrust in God;
neither yet when he was upon the pinnacle, being tempted of Satan to fall down
under the show of Gods providence, yet would he not tempt God in neglecting
the means to go down by the steps. Ma. 4. And of this you may see more in
the book of God, how Moses, David, and Paul, used the means of prayer,
labor, and all other honest and lawful things, to bring their matters to
pass; although they knew that al things were wroght and came to pass by Gods
providence. Exodus 14.13, 14, 15. psalm. 3.5, 6, 8. 1. Sam. 19.11, 12. Acts
27.22, 23.24, 25, 30, 31.

Question.

What is the use of this doctrine?

Answer.

First, faith in God. Psalm. 3.5, 6, 7, 8, and 23. the whole. psalm. 37.5.

Secondly, comfort. 2. Kings. 6.16, 17. Acts. 27.24, 25.

Thirdly, patience in all our troubles; seeing God (who is our Father) sends
afflictions for our comfort, and will return them to our good. Romans 5.3, 4.
psalm. 37.7. Iam. 1.2, 3, 4.

Fourthly, we ought to use all godly and honest means: as, Matthew. 4.

First, prayer for them. Psalm. 50.14, 15.

Secondly, labor to attain them in time of want by industries.

Thirdly, Physic in sickness. Matthew. 9.12. Esaias. 38.21.

Fourthly, flight in persecution. Matthew. 10.23.

Fifthlie, meat, drink, and cloth, during our pilgrimage. Act. 27.33, 34,
35, 36. Matthew. 14.15, to 22.

Sixthly, we ought to tie God to them, neither to depend on them as things of
of necessity. Matthew. 4.

The end of the first part.
The second part of the Catechism.
Question.

LEt us come unto the second part of our Catechism, and tell me, what is the
same?

Answer.

The redemption of mankind.

Question.

What is redemption?

Answer.

It is our deliverance in Jesus Christ from all the former evils of our fall: as
the power of sin, the curse of God, and eternal death: also, a preparing
(for us) of an estate of happiness, more excellent than the first. Galat. 3.13,
14. Gal. 1.4. Titu. 2.14. Romans 8.17.

Question.

How is Christ our redeemer?

Answer.

First, by the ordinance of GOD his father. Luke. 1. Acts. 4.12.

Secondly, by affinity, in taking upon him our nature, and so to become our
head and elder brother. Ephesians. 5.30. Heb. 2.16, 17.

Thirdly, by right: as,

First, in that he is Lord of the whole world: for all things were made and
are ruled by him. John. 1.2, 3, 4, 5. Col. 1.16, 17. Heb. 1.2, 3.

Secondly, because he has redeemed his people by his obedience, in shedding of
his precious blood. Romans 5.6, 7, 8, 9. 1. pet. 1.18, 19, 20.

Question.

What things belong unto Christ our Redeemer?

Answer.

Three things?

First, perfect wise. Secondly, perfect rich. Thirdly, perfect strong.
Question.

Why perfect wise?

Answer.

First to bring to naught the crafty devises of Satan and his accomplices. 1.
Cor. 1.19, 20, 24, 25.

Secondly, to make his people wise to salvation, and to forsake all the
subtilties of Satan and his instruments, in heresies, and corrupt manners. 2.
Tim. 3.15.16, 17.

Question.

Why perfect rich?

Answer.

First, to be of sufficient ability to redeem his people, and to pay the
price of redemption: the which he has most fully and sufficiently already
done, by his death and blood. Titus. 2.14. col. 1.11, 12, 13, 14.

Secondly, to make his people rich in faith, obedience, and all other heavenly
and spiritual graces. To. 1.8. 1. cor. 6.7. ephesians. 1.3. col. 1.9.

Question.

Why of power?

Answer.

First, to overcome his enemies, and the enemies of his people; as satan,
sin, and eternal death. 1. Cor. 15.54, 55, 56, 57. Heb. 2.14, 15. 1. John
3.8.

Secondly, to deliver his people from these their enemies, and to give them
strength to overcome. Romans 7.24, 25. 1. cor. 15. ephesians. 6.12. to 18. 1. John 5.4,
5.

Question.

Is there any other Savior, than Christ only?

Answer.

No: for he it is that must both save from death eternal, and give life
everlasting. Ioh. 3.16. and 5.24.

Question.

What think you of the^ that seek their salvation else where, as in their
works, and good inte^ts?

Answer.

First, they herein deny Christ to be the only Savior: for he will be a
whole Savior or else none. Acts. 4.12. Matthew. 3.17.

Secondly, they make themselves to be half saviors, and to be equal and
copartners with Christ, in the work of redemtion. tit. 3.4, 5.

Thirdly, they resist the ordinance and decree of God, who appointed Christ to
be the sole Savior of mankind. Matt. 1.21.

Fourthly, in steed of heaven and everlasting life, they (by their good intents
and works) do purchase hell and everlasting death. Ioh. 3.17, 36.

Question.

What use ought we to make of this point?

Answer.

First, to note how miserable we were of our selves after our fall: as,

First, in sin. Psalm. 51.5. Ier. 17.2.

Secondly, under the wrath of God. ephesians. 2.3

Thirdly, captives to the devil. ephesians. 2.2.

Fourthly, inheritors of hell, and eternal death. Romans 6.23.

Secondly, the great and rich mercy of God,

First, in giving us a Savior, that might redeem us from sin, satan and
hell. Ephesians. 2.4, 5. Tit. 3.4, 5.

Secondly, in seeking to reconcile us to him self, and to make us his
children, and righteous. 2. cor. 5.18, 19, 20, 21.

Thirdly, in giving us thereby everlasting life, and eternal happiness. Ioh.
5.24.

Question.

Seeing we are now redeemed in Christ: are we now therefore in a better and more
happier estate under Christ our head, than Adam was in his innocence in
Paradise?

Answer.

Yea surely, the estate of Gods children is now more excellent.

Question.

Why so?

Answer.

First, because we have an excellent head, to wit Christ, which Adam had not
in the time of his innoce^cie before his fall: Ephesians. 1.22. col. 1.18.

Secondly, God is more nearer joined unto us, than he was unto Adam; (at yt
time) for he has taken upon himself since Adams fall, our humane nature, and
joined the same to his divine nature, and is become one with us (sin
excepted) Ephe. 5.30. Heb. 2.16. 1. Pet. 2.23. 1. Ioh. 3.5.

Thirdly, our salvation is more certain, tha^ it was under Adam: for then we
had no power to stand in the perfection of our creation: but now in Christ it
is most certain and firm, because it is grounded

First, upon the everlasting and unchangeable decree and purpose of God. Ephesians.
1. 11.2. Tim. 2.19.

Secondly, upon the everlasting mercies of God in Christ. 2. Tim. 1.9.

Thirdly, upon his faithfulness, truth, and righteousness. 1. cor. 1.9. 1.
these. 5.24.

Fourthly, upon his invincible power and omnipotency. John 10.27, 28, 29.

Fourthly, God does not only give us heaven (which Adam should have had in his
innocence) but also makes us heirs (yea joint heirs) with Christ in glory,
the which Adam should never have had, if he had stood in his innocence: so
that we may see our estate far better than Adams in Paradise. Romans 8.17.

Question.

And is not man made more excellent, than the Angels in heaven?

Answer.

Yes verily: for,

First, Christ took upon him our nature, and exalted it above all
principalities, powers and Dominions. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22.

Secondly, man is made the Lord and ruler of the whole world, and that through
grace in Christ: which rule and lorldlie authority, was never given unto the
Angels. Psalm. 8. the whole.

Thirdly, the Angels by the free mercies of God, are made the servants of the
faithful, to defend and comfort them: for they are the ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister (for their sakes that shall be heirs to salvation)
psalm. 34.7. Heb. 1.14.

Question.

In that thou say, that man is restored to a better estate than Adam in his
first innocence in Paradise, and is become more excellent than Angels: is thy
meaning of all mankind, and of all persons generally?

Answer.

No surely, but only of the faithful, who are grafted into the body of
Christ by ye holy ghost; as for infidels, hipocrites, heretics, libertines,
and atheists, their estate is no better than the devils in hell, in shame and
confusion for ever and ever. Revel. 21.28. Ephesians. 5.5.

Question.

Why; died not Christ for all men, as well as for a certain number?

Answer.

1, 17.

Question.

What moved God to save some, and damn other some? In that he saves some, is
it for that they deserve the same; or did he foresee, that they would both
believe, and work out their salvation?

Answer.

His own mercy is the cause, that he saves some out of the sinful lump of
Adam: for

First, all deserved damnation; for the best work after regeneration, is
defiled with sin; and the reward of sin is death: how much more then deserve
we death before God does regenerate us by his spirit. 1. cor. 13.9. To. 7.24.

Secondly, faith is ye only gift of god. ephesians. 2.8

Thirdly, we cannot work well, before God regenerate us unto good works. ephesians.

Ephe. 3.17. Ephe. 1.13. 1. Ioh. 3.1, 2, 3.

Question.

Our sanctification.

Question.

Where shall we find the same delivered at large unto us?

Answer.

In the third part of the articles of our faith.

Question.

Into how many parts shall we divide this point?

Answer.

Into three: as; First, who sanctifies (that is) the Holy Ghost, as in the 8.
article appears. Secondly, whom he sanctifies, (vz.) his Church: and the
means whereby he sanctifies it, as in the 9. article. Thirdly of the
spiritual benefits and graces that belongs to the Church only, in the 10,
11, and 12, articles.


Question.

Which is the first Article of the 3. part of the Articles of our faith.

Answer.

This: I believe in the holy Ghost?

Question.

What learn you out of the same?

Answer.

First that the holy Ghost is God, proceeding from the Father and the Son,
the third person in Trinity, and nothing inferior to the Father nor the
Son, either in substance or glory, but of the same substance and glory with
them. Matthew. 28.19. Acts. 5.3, 4.

Secondly, it is he that instructs, sanctifies, comfort, and confirms
the elect, in the truth of the promises of the Gospel of Christ unto
salvation, and everlasting life. Ephesians. 1.13. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6. 2. cor. 1.21, 22.

Thirdly, the holy Ghost executes ye great providence of God, over all his
creatures, whereby they continue in their estate, and orders the event and
success of things, that nothing comes to pass by chance, or any way else,
but by his disposition and apointme^t. Gene. 1.2. Psalm. 145.7, to 11.

Fourthly, that the sin against the holy Ghost, shall not be forgiven in this
life, nor in the life to come. Matthew. 12.31, 32. Heb. 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Question.

Answer.

All the people of God in Christ: who are called the Church of God, and spouse
of Christ. Ephe. 5.26, 27. 1. cor. 1.2.

Question.

Rehearse the Article.

Answer.

I believe that there is a catholic Church, and a communion of Saints.

Question.

What is the Church of God?

Answer.

It is all the elect of what sex and estate soever, which have been, are, and
shall be, unto the ends of the world; which are called by the only working of
the holy Ghost; by external ministry and preaching of the word, confirmed
by sacraments, and finally governed by the holy discipline of their head
Christ. John. 20.16. and 17.20. Col. 3.10, 11. Gal. 3.26, 27, 28, 29. Ephe.
4.30. Romans 10.17. Romans 4.11. Math. 18.15, to 21.

Question.

Thou say, that the church consists of the elect: therefore tell me, what
is election?

Answer.

It is the everlasting and unchangeable Decree, of the almighty, wise, and
just God; who of his free and rich mercy, through faith in the blood of his
only beloved Son, has chosen to life eternal, such as it pleased
himself. Ephesians. 1.2. Tim. 1.9. 1. Pet. 1.2.

Question.

What learn you out of this article?

Answer.

First, that there is an election belonging unto all estates, and that through
Gods mercy, and Christ's merits apprehended by faith. Romans 9.24, 25, 26, 27.
Ephesians. 1.4, 5, 6, 7.

Secondly, yt there is a Church of Christ, (partly military, and partly
triumphant) the which Church shall be to the end of the world, and (in the
life to come) shall be ever more without end, let the devil, and men rage,
and roar while they will. Revel. 6.5.6, 7. 2. Tim. 1.9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22.
Matthew. 16.12.

Thirdly, As their election is of God, and their redemption in Christ: so their
vocation and sanctification is of the holy Ghost, by the ministry, and
preaching of the word and sacraments. 1. cor. 6.10. Romans 10.17. Gal. 3.2. Tit.
3.5.

Fourthly, he governs the flock of Christ by his effectual working in their
hearts, and his word. 1. Cor. 1.2, 3, etc.

Fifthly, that there must be an holy fellowship, and a godly Communion of the
saints of God, in all holiness and righteousness. psa. 85.10. Heb. 12.14.

Question.

As in the beginning of this Article, thou did set down the doctrine of
election: and how only it does belong to the faithful members thereof, so
tell me more plainly thy meaning therein.

Answer.

I will: and that is this; although the faithful are but few in number, yet
the greater part of them, do consist of the poor, of the fools, and of the
weak ones of the world, to whom (although they be so accounted of among men)
the election, through grace, does belong only unto them. 1. cor. 1.27, to the
end.

Question.

If there be an election, there is also a reprobation?

Answer.

It is most true: there is also a reprobation.

Question.

What is reprobation?

Answer.

It is an utter rejecting and hardening of the hearts of those, who are
ordained to everlasting destruction, that they cannot repent, and believe the
Gospel to salvation. Roman 9.17, 18, 22. Iud. 3. Revel. 17.8.

Question.

How are the wicked in fault, if God appoint the^ to destruction; for who can
resist his will?

Answer.

I answer you thus: that

First, the counsel of God excuses not the wickedness of the wicked: for the
reprobate commits sin most willingly, and without constraint on the Lords
behalf; so that although his reprobation be of the Lord, his damnation is of
himself, as Pharaoh, Judas. Exodus 9, 10, and 11. chap. Matthew. 26.

Secondly, the Apostle teaches us to humble our selves, and not to carpe at
the deep secrets of God, when he says: Who art thou o man, that thou
should plead with God. To. 9.20, 21.

Question.

But if it be so, (touching the life to come) that God has appointed already
the elect and reprobate, and has appointed all the means to bring his
counsel to pass; we may do what we list: for if appointed to be saved, we
shall be saved; if appointed to be damned, we shall be damned: and therefore
all labor lost.

Answer.

It is certain that we cannot frustrate and alter the counsel of God: no, not
the least mean thereunto belonging: for then there should be in God (First,
darkness. Secondly, ignorance. Thirdly, weakness)


If things could fall out otherwise, than God saw should come to pass, and as
he before had appointed. Iam. 1.17. 2. Timoth. 2.19.

Question.

Is it not then in vain, as I have already said, to labor, and to use the
means to enjoy life, and to do the works commanded?

Answer.

No: for God has appointed the means how to come to salvation in his
foreknowledge, and unchangeable purpose, namely, the preaching of the word,
reading and meditating thereof; also, the sacraments, and prayer: these things
must be used, and those that are the sheep of Christ, shall, and will use them.
And as for good works, we are both commanded to do them, and to make our
election sure by them. Ioh. 10.26, 27. 2. pet. 1.8, 10.

Question.

Why does God save some, and damn other some?

Answer.

First, that he might show his mercy to his elect to the praise of his glory.
Romans 9.15, 23.

Secondly, that he might show forth his justice upon the reprobate, to the
praise thereof, and to be glorified to their condemnation. Romans 9.22.

Question.

What fruits have we of this doctrine of predestination?

Answer.

First, it ministers great strength unto our faith, against all temptation. 1.
cor. 10.13.

Secondly, comfort in all our afflictions, because we shall not be overcome by
them, nor perish in them. Romans 8.18.

Thirdly, thanksgiving is thereby required. Ephe. 1.8. Romans 15.9, 10, 11.

First, for his unchangeable truth.

Secondly, his everlasting mercies.

Thirdly, his invincible power.

Question.

Then you firmly believe, that it is impossible for the elect of God to fall
away?

Answer.

Yea verily: for although it were possible, that heaven, earth, men, and
angels, should conspire against them; yet they cannot be lost; no, not the
least, nor the poorest of them: for God is both unchangeable in his purpose,
and Almightinesse it self: therefore his counsel shall stand for ever, (and
that for his) against the gates of hell, Romans 8.38, 39. Matthew. 16.18.

Question.

But we see many (after they have professed the truth) have fallen from the
same?

Answer.

It is true: but they never believed and acknowledged the truth in sincerity of
heart: wherefore the spirit of God casts them out of the number of the sacred
flock of God, as hypocrites to their shame: for if they had bin of God
(although subject to many infirmities) they should not have perished; for God
would have put his hand under them, and raised them up, and kept them to
everlasting life. Psalm. 145.14. 1. Ioh. 2.27.

Question.

What are the means whereby he sanctifies his people?

Answer.

First the ministry of the word. Iho. 17.17.

Secondly, Sacraments. Titus. 3.5.

Thirdly, discipline. Matthew. 18.

Fourthly, Prayer. Matthew. 7.7.

Question.

How does he sanctify his Church by his word?

Answer.

First, in that he begets and connecteth his people by the word. Psalm. 19.7.
1. Pet. 3.23.

Secondly, in that he works faith in the hearts of his people, and so
purifieth their hearts by faith. Romans 10.17.

Thirdly, by the word (which is the two edged sword) he (with the one side)
kills the reprobate: and (with the other) cutteth off all the exile
affections of his people, and renews them daily to holiness. Hebru. 4.12.

Question.

What learn you hereby?

Answer.

First, the excellency and power of the word of God. 2. Cor. 4.3.4.

Secondly, the necessity of the word: for, where Prophecy wants, there the
people perish. Pro. 29.18. Hosea. 4.6.

Thirdly, the happiness of them (that have the word preached for salvation) is
both brought and offered unto them. Titu. 2.11. 2. Cor. 6.1, 2.

Fourthly, as there must needs be blindness, ignorance, infidelity, and al
corruption, both of religion and manners: so the misery of them that have not
the word preached is here set down. Iere. 88. Romans 1.21. etc.

Question.

Let us come to Sacraments, and tell me, what is a Sacrament?

Answer.

A Sacrament is a visible and earthly sign, representing, invisible, and
supernatural graces, not to be seen by the carnal and outward eye of man,
but with the eye of faith. Also a Seal to confirm our faith in the covenant
of grace: and finally a badge and mark of Christianity. Gene. 17.11. Romans
4.11. Mark. 1.4, 8. Gala. 3.27.

Question.

How many Sacraments are there?

Answer.

Not seven, as the Papists have dreamed: but two, that is, Baptism, and the
Lords supper. 1. cor. 10.16, 21.

Question.

Who is the author of these two sacraments?

Answer.

Almighty God ordained Baptism from heaven, and Jesus Christ the holy Supper
upon earth. Ioh. 1.32, 33. Matthew. 26.26, 27, 28.

Question.

Has man power to make sacraments?

Answer.

No: For, first they are part of Gods service. Matt. 28.19, 20.

Secondly, they witness the goodness of God unto us. Matthew. 26.26, 27, 28.

Thirdly, they are seals to confirm our faith in the covenant of God in
Christ. Roman. 4 11.

Fourthly, the word of salvation and reconciliation must go with the signs, or
else they are no sacraments.

Question.

What think you of them, that take upon them to make Sacraments?

Answer.

Their folly and presumption is great: and herein they blaspheme God, as though
he knew not what was ncessarie for his Church, without their rashness and
devilish pride. Besides, neither Moses, Solomon, nor Paul, ever durst to do
the same in any of Gods services. Exo. 35, 36, 37, 38. etc. and 25.4. 1. Reg.
6, 7, 8. 1. Cor. 11. Act. 7.44.

Question.

What is Baptism?

Answer.

It is a sacrament ordained of God, of public washing with water, once, in
the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy ghost: signifying thereby our
remission of sins, mortification, and sanctification in the death and
resurrection of Christ. John 1.33. Math. 28.19. Mark. 1.4, 8. Romans 6.4, 5, 6.

Question.

How many things have we to consider of in this Sacrament?

Answer.

First, the institution of God. Ioh. 1.33.

Secondly, the external thing, water. mar. 1.8.

Thirdly, the promise: to wit, remission of sins in Christ. Mark. 1.4.

Fourthly, faith in the promised seed, which is Christ. Mark. 16.16.

Question.

What do you gather by Baptism?

Answer.

First, that I am a vile sinner, and the child of wrath by nature. Psalm. 51.5.
Gene. 6.5.

Secondly, a profession of my faith in the holy Trinity, and of my salvation
and remission of sins in the blood of Christ. Mat. 28.19. Acts. 2.38.

Thirdly, the promise that God made to me, to be my God: and that I made unto
GOD, to deny the world, mortefie the old man, resist satan; and to delight
in true righteousness and holiness, as it becomes his obedient child who is
renewed. Acts. 2.38, 39.

Fourthly, it is the seal of righteousness and salvation unto me, through the
mercies of God in Christ Jesus. Romans 4.11.

Fifthly, the benefits which God offreth unto me by Baptism, as the instrument
by which I am ingrafted into Christ's body. 1. Cor. 12. Gal. 3.27.

Question.

What is the old man?

Answer.

All the corruption of our defiled nature, which we got by the Apostacy of our
first parents Adam and Eve: and all the custom of sinning, according to the
conversation of old. Ephe. 4.22.

Question.

What is Apostacy?

Answer.

It is an utter and whole entire falling away from the estate and perfection
wherein we were first created: or now from the faith of Christ.

Question.

What is mortification?

Answer.

A continual killing and subduing of the old man. Col. 3.5. Gal. 5.27.

Question.

What is renewing or regeneration?

Answer.

A begetting or new birth in Christ, which is called the new man. Ephe. 4.23.

Question.

What is the new man?

Answer.

A renewing in the spirit by the Holy ghost, into true righteousness and
holiness. Ephesians. 4.24.

Question.

What are the benefits received?

Answer.

First remission of sins. Acts. 2.38.

Secondly, the power of sin killed in me. Romans 6.3, 4, etc.

Thirdly, the Holy ghost given unto me. Romans 8.9. Tit: 3.5.

Fourthly, Faith confirmed in me. Romans 4.11. Acts. 8.37, 38.

Question.

Can the outward sign, that is, water; give the invisible graces, which are,
remission of sins, regeneration, faith, and the Holy ghost?

Answer.

No: for,

First, how can earthly things give spiritual graces: and how can the creature
give the things of the creator. Heb. 9.14.

Secondly, remission of sins is only in the blood of Christ through faith.
Ephe. 1.7. col. 1.14.

Thirdly, it is the Holy ghost that must kill sin, and quicken us unto
righteousness. Titu: 3.5.

Fourthly, faith is the gift of God. Ephe. 2.8.

Fifthly, the holy Ghost gives himself to his children. Romans 8. Ephe. 1.13.

Question.

If sins be not washed away by Baptism; Why did Ananias say to Paul, Acts.
9, 17. that he should wash away his sin by Baptism?

Answer.

The Apostle Paul is put in mind (even as all true and faithful Christians
are) by the sign of Baptism, that his sins were forgiven him.

Question.

Yea: but the same Apostle says. Ephe. 5.26. that the water in Baptism
cleanses the Church and sanctifies her?

Answer.

The Apostle (in the words going before, and in the words following after)
shows: that it is only Christ, that does by his death and word, both
cleanse, and sanctify his Church: of which, Baptism is both a seal and
figure.

Question.

Regeneration is attributed to the water in Baptism by the Apostle, in the
third of Titus the fifth verse.

Answer.

The Apostle in that place: shows, that regeneration is only the work of
the holy Ghost, and of no other; of which, the sacrament of Baptism is a sure
figure.

Question.

What if children die without Baptism: are they damned?

Answer.

No: for,

First, salvation hangs upon election. Ephe. 1.4, 5, 6. 2. Timo. 1.9.

Secondly, God has promised he will be a God to the faithful and their
seed. Gene. 17.7.

Thirdly, the kingdom of God belongs to little children. Matthew. 18.10.

Fourthly, only salvation is in Christ, and without him no salvation. Acts.
12.4. John. 3.16, 17.

Question.

Our Savior Christ says, Verelie, verelie, J say unto thee, except a man be
borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. So
that he makes it a necessity, to be baptized to salvation?

Answer.

First, this place does nothing belong to the Sacrament of Baptism: for only
in that place our Savior Christ shows, that Nicodemus could not be a fit
instrument to receive the Gospel, without he were renewed by the spirit unto
righteousness.

Secondly we cannot read in this chapter, that Nicodemus was baptized, the
which (if it had been of such a necessity) both he should and would have been
presently baptized, and the Evangelist would have noted the same.

Thirdly, admit that Christ did speak of Baptism, yet the word must not be
so urged, that he includes salvation in water, but he rather joins water
with the spirit, because he testifies and seals unto us, (by that visible
sign) newnes of life, which God alone, does work in us by his holy spirit.

Question.

What gather you by this doctrine, of the Papists?

Answer.

First, they are most cruel against poor infants.

Secondly, most wicked to tie God to external means and deny his covenant.

Thirdly, if all be damned that are not Baptized; then all are saved, if they
be Baptized.

Fourthly, by this doctrine; although Baptized, yet if children die before they
eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ they are damned. John. 6.53.

Question.

May private men and women minister the Sacrament of Baptism?

Answer.

No surely: for,

First, the Lord has tied the same unto his lawful ministers, with the
preaching of the word. Matthew. 28.19, 20. 1. Cor. 14.34, 35.

Secondly, if they may administer Baptism, they may as well administer the
Sacrament of the Lords supper, and preach the word publicly; which things
are absurd and wicked.

Question.

God was pleased with Zipporah her act, in circumcising her son with a
stone?

Answer.

First, Almighty God, did not approve her fact; otherwise we might say, that
the worshipping which the Gentiles (that were brought from Assiria) raised up,
did please God, because the beasts did cease to afflict the people. Exodus 4.24,
25, 26. 2. Reg. 17.41.

Secondly, that which is particular, ought not to be made a general example.

Question.

Do we not sin most heynouslie, if we walk not according to our promise
made unto God in Baptism?

Answer.

Yes verelie: for,

First, we break our promise with GOD, and falsefie our faith with the holy
Trinity. Matthew. 28.19. Titu. 3.4, 5, 6, 7.

Secondly, we crucify a new our savior Christ, and tread the blood of the
holy covenant under foot. Heb. 6.6. and 10.26, 27, 28, 29.

Thirdly, we grieve the holy Ghost, by whom the elect are sealed unto the
everlasting redemption. Ephe. 4.29, 30.

Fourthly, we mock and grieve the holy Angels who rejoice at the repentance of
a sinner, and cause them to be our enemies to destruction, who are appointed
of God to be the ministers of the elect unto Salvation. Matthew. 18.10. Luke.
15.10.

Fifthly, we give offense unto the Church: but it had been better that a
Millstone had been hanged about our necks, and we cast into the Sea. Matthew.
8.6, 7.

Sixthly, we do not only bereave our selves of all the spiritual gifts of
Gods spirit: but also we are murderers of our own souls, in that we bereave
our selves of Christ, who is the very life it self. John. 14.6. Roma. 8.9, 10,
etc.

Question.

The sign may not be neglected of Christians, may it?

Answer.

No, God forbid it should: for if we neglect and contemn the Sacrament, it is
an accursed and wicked kind of dealing in men; as namely ye Anabaptists who
deny the Sacrament of Baptism to youg infants, wherein they show their
ignorance.

For first they be under the covenant, Exodus 4.24, 25, 26. Gene. 17.9, 10.

Secondly, the kingdom of God belongs unto them. Matthew. 18.

Question.

Now let us come unto the Lords supper: when did he institute the same?

Answer.

Presently, after the eating of the passover and also a little before his
death: thereby

First, to show unto us, that the Passover was ended in him. 1. Cor. 5.7.

Secondly, to put us always in remembrance of his sufferings. Matthew. 26.26, 27.

Question.

What is the Lords supper?

Answer.

It is a holy banquet, and a sacrament of public eating and drinking of Bread
and Wine: to put in mind all believing Christians (which are of a good and a
sound discretion) how Christ was put to death, and did shed his blood, for the
remission of their sins, and so is become their meat and drink, (thorough
faith) to everlasting life. Mat. 29.26, 27. 1. Cor. 10.16. 1. Cor. 11.23, 24,
25.

Question.

How many things are to be considered of, in this sacrament?

Answer.

Fouer: as first, Christ and his institution. Math. 26.26. etc.

Secondly, the external signs, Bread and Wine. Math. 26.

Thirdly, the promise of redemption, and remission of sins in Christ. 1. Corinthians. 11.23. etc.

Fourthly, faith in the promise to justification and everlasting life. John.
66.54. etc.

Question.

How is our faith nourished and confirmed by the Lords supper?

Answer.

First, in that our savior Christ gives himself unto us, therein assuring
that his body was given unto the death of the Cross, and his blood shed for
us. Matthew. 26.26, 27, 28. phil. 2.8. 1. pet. 2.24.

Secondly, the bread and wine which we take, and eat and drink, (according
to his holy institution,) do teach us, that by faith we do eat and drink
the body and blood of Jesus Christ, as the only comfort and nourishment of our
souls. John. 6.48, 51.

Question.

What is the Analogy between the signs, and the things signified?

Answer.

It stands, in feeding, nourishing, comforting, refreshing: in union, and in
fellowship.

Question.

As how? Show me?

Answer.

First, as the bread and wine, do feed, nourish and refresh the natural
body of man; even so, the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Christ (with
the merits of his passion) do spirituallie, feed, nourish, comfort, and
refresh, our poor famished and thirsty souls. Ioh. 6.32, 33.35. 1. Cor.
11.24, 25, 26.

Secondly, as many corns and grapes are united into one loaf, and one wine:
even so, are we united into one mystical body, and have union and fellowship
with Christ; and be as members one with another. 1. Corin. 10.16, 17.

Question.

Then we do not, reallie, and verelie, eat and drink the natural flesh and
blood of Christ in the holy supper?

Answer.

No: for, first it fights against the nature of a Sacrament: for how can it
be a sign, and the thing it self?

Secondy, if we be fed with the accidents of Bread and Wine? It should follow,
that our bodies, should be accidental bodies: bodies in show, and not bodies
in deed and of substance.

Thirdly, it were to deny, that Christ took flesh of the Virgin Marie, if the
substance of Bread and Wine do become his flesh; or else to say, he had a mixte
body; either of which is blasphemy. Matthew. 1.23. Romans 1.3.

Fourthly, it were to make Christ to have a fantastical body, if his natural
body be in every place, after the words of consecration.

Fifthly, it were to deny Christ's Ascension and his sitting at Gods right hand,
and as much as to say, the resurrection is past. Act. 1.9, 10. and 3.21.

Sixthly, it were to make him subject to corruption as the Bread and Wine is.
Phil. 3. 20, 21. 1. Timo. 1.17, 18.

Seauenthly, it were to make Christ subject to sin, for the Bread and Wine
becomes our substance.

Eighthly, they most blasphemouslie affirm, by this their opinion, that Christ
should return into our draught: O monstrous blasphemy. Matthew. 15.17.

Ninthly, if it were the very body of Christ, that the Apostles did eat at the
last supper: then where was the body that must suffer for our sakes: a
fantastical body could not redeem us. And if they did eat but half of the
body, and left the other half to suffer: we could not be redeemed by half.
Herein therefore we may see how foolish a doctrine Popery is.

Question.

Our savior Christ (who is very truth, and cannot lie) says; take, eat,
this is my body: and therefore his very body?

Answer.

Our Savior Christ calls himself a door, a vine, a way, and is also called
a rock, compared to a thief, and said to be the day Star. John. 10.7.
and 15.1. and 14.6. 1. Cor. 10.4. Re. 22.16. Is Christ therefore? a way? a
vine? a rock? thief? and a day Sarre? O no: it were most foolish and wicked,
so to reason and conclude. He is in deed, the only door, thorough whom we
must enter into salvation: the only way, to eternal life: the only tree and
root, from whence we must draw all heavenly and comfortable graces: the sure
rock to build on to salvation: the thief to come suddenly upon the wicked
to destruction: and the glorious wisdom of his father, to inlighten our
hearts, to know God to salvation. And even so, he calls the bread his body,
because it is a sacrament of his body: that is, it shows how his body was
crucified and put to death; and the wine his blood, because it is a sign how
his blood was shed.

Question.

Does the wicked and unbelieving person, receive the benefit of Christ's death
in receiving the external sign?

Answer.

No: for,

First, they have not faith. Titus. 1.1, 2. 1. These. 3.2.

Secondly, they have not the spirit of Christ: which things should make them
worthy receivers of the benefits of Christ's death, to the remission of sins
and everlasting life. Romans 8.7, 8.

Question.

In receiving the sacramental signs, do they not bring great hurt to
themselves?

Answer.

Yes verily: for first they are herein guilty of the body and blood of Christ.
1. Corin. 11.27.

Secondly, they eat and drink their own damnation. 1. Cor. 11.29.

Question.

How can they be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, to their
condemnation: unless they eat the very flesh, and drink the very blood of
Christ. 1. Cor. 11.

Answer.

To be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, and to eat unworthily to
condemnation; is to come rashely without due examining of themselves: also to
come like dogs in their vomit and hoggs in their filthy mier, making no
account of the holy supper, and sacramental signs so that this very contempt,
reaches unto the author himself namely Jesus Christ, and his death and blood
shedding.

Question.

What does the bread broken, and the wine powered forth signify?

Answer.

The breaking of the body, and the shedding of the blood of Christ. 1.
Corinthians. 10.16.

Question.

What do you gather thereby?

Answer.

First, what horrible and vile sinners we are. Pro. 20.9. 1. John. 1.1.10.

Secondly, how we deserve the horrible, and intolerable torments of hell
fire everlastingly. Romans. 6.23. Ephesians. 2.2, 3.

Thirdly, the great love of GOD, in sending his son to take upon him our
nature, and to die for us to our redemption. John. 3.16. 1. John. 4.9, 10.

Fourthly, the great love of Christ, and his humility, to humble himself unto
the cursed death of the Cross and torments of hell for our salvation. Phil.
2.5, 6, 7, 8. Ioh. 10.11.

Question.

What think you of the Papists, which deliver not the holy supper, after the
institution of Christ?

Answer.

They deal

First, injuriously against Christ.

Secondly, wickedly against the people; in that they bereave them of such
notable uses, in the breaking of the bread and pouring forth of the Wine.

Question.

How shall we come worthelie to receive the holy supper?

Answer.

First by repentance. Mark. 1.15.

Secondly, by faith. Ephe. 3.16, 17.

Thirdly, by love. 1. Cor. 10.17.

Fourthly, by thanksgiving. Luke. 22.24.

Question.

How may a christian assure himself that he comes in true repentance?

Answer.

If he be truly touched with his sins, and inwardly grieved for them;
loathing sin from the bottom of his heart; With a true confession unto GOD,
and with a full purpose to amend and live, in the fear of GOD; Then he has
truly repented. Psalm. 51.17. Joel. 2.12, 13. Esaias. 1.16.17. Romans. 12.1, 2.

Question.

How may he persuade himself that he has a live lie faith?

Answer.

If he feel effectually in his heart, the benefits of Christ's death, to the
remission of sins, and his salvation: and confesses Gods mercies herein, he
has a true and lively faith. Romans. 3.24. Galathians 2.20. Collos. 1.21, 22,
23.

Question.

How in true love?

Answer.

If he hartelie forgive his neighbors for the offenses and injuries done
against him: also, if he be ready to do good unto all, especially unto the
house of the faithful: and finally, if he have a care to instruct and teach
his family, and neighbors in the truth of GOD, and the faith of Christ: then
he may persuade himself he has true love. Romans 12.20, 21. Ephesians. 4.1, 2, 3, 4.
col. 3.12, 13, 14, 15.

Question.

How in thanksgiving?

Answer.

If from the heart both in word and works, he give all praise and glory to
GOD through Christ, for the benefits of salvation; and not attribute them to
his own wisdom, power, and riches; neither yet to bury them in the pit of
forgetfulness: and finally, do not turn the grace of God to wantonness.
Psa. 103.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Iere. 9.23, 24. Romans 15. Iud. 4. Romans 6.1.

Question.

Let us come unto the third mean, whereby our faith is increased and
maintained, by discipline, and tell me what discipline is?

Answer.

Discipline is the comely order of holy government appointed of Christ in his
Churth, to be exercised and used of his Ministers, and Elders, to keep in the
good, and to punish the wicked, and that to be done in great love and pity.
Matthew. 16.19. John 20.20. Math. 18.15, 16. Romans 12.3, 4, 6, 7, 8. Matthew. 18.17.
Gal. 6.1, 2, 3, etc.

Question.

Wherein stands it?

Answer.

First, in exhortations and admonitions. 1 Thessalonians. 5.13, 14.

Secondly, in threatenings and corrections. 2. Tim. 4.2, 3, 4, etc.

Thirdly, in excommunications, and casting forth the great offenders (that
will not be amended by these proceedings) out of the fellowship of the
faithful, and from the partaking at the Lords Table. 1. cor. 5.12. 1. tim.
5.20. Matt. 18.17. Tit. 3.10.11.

Question.

What are the ends of excommunication?

Answer.

First, that a wicked liver to the great reproach of God and his Gospel, be
not suffered among Christians. 1. cor. 5.4, 5. 1. Tim. 1.20.

Secondly, that the good may not be corrupted through the continual
familiarity of the wicked. 1. cor, 5.6. 2 Thessalonians. 3.14, 15.

Thirdly, that he that has so fallen, may through the shame of the world
repent, and seek to be received into the Church again, with all meekness. 1.
cor. 5.5.

Question.

Let us come now to the last mean, that is, Prayer, and tell me, who teaches
thee to pray?

Answer.

The Holy ghost.

Question.

What is Prayer?

Answer.

It is a reverent talking with God, with a pure mind, craving such things as
we want, according to the holy will of God. Phil. 4.6. psalm. 145.18. Iam. 2.3.
1. John. 3.22, 23, 24. Matthew. 15.7, 8.

Question.

Seeing that God knows what need we have before we ask, and that all things
shall come to pass according to his appointed providence: wherefore should we
pray?

Answer.

First, to obey, and imitate Christ our commander. Mark. 13.33. Psalm. 50.15.

Secondly, to stir up our selves to seek God in truth and humility. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17, 18. psalm. 145.18, 19.

Thirdly, that we may thereby unload our selves of many griefs, and commend
al our ways unto him. Luke 18, 13.14.

Fourthly, to exercise our faith in meditating upon the promises of God and his
works. Matthew. 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Psalm. 143.10, 11.

Fifthly, to testify that we confess there is but one (and that a true) God,
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: and that he only is the Author of all
good gifts both earthly and heavenly. Psalm. 37.5. and 55.22. Iam. 1.17. Psalm.
104, 10, to 16. and 145.15, 16.

Question.

What things belong unto prayer?

Answer.

First, that we be inwardly touched, and have a feeling in conscience of those
things that we pray for: as either for remission of sins, spiritual graces,
or temporal benefits. Roma. 8.26, 27. Luke 18.9. Psalm. 6.1, 2, 3.

Secondly, whether by our prayers we have had experience of Gods goodness, in
granting our former requests, to confirm our present faith. Psalm. 116.1, 2,
3, 4, etc. 2. cor. 1.3, 4.

Thirdly, that our prayers be in truth and in sincerity of heart, free from al
hypocrisy. psa. 4.1. and 145.18, 19. 2. Tim. 2.19.

Fourthly, that our prayers proceed from faith, with full assurance of the
help of God, and a sure belief to obtain that which we do ask, according
to his word and promises. Iam. 1.4, 5. Mark. 11.24.

Fifthly, although our prayers be not at the first granted, yet we must not
cease to pray. Luke 18.1, to 9. Romans 12.12.

Question.

Unto whom must we make our prayers?

Answer.

Only unto God: for, faith only belongs unto him. Psalm. 50.15. Matt. 6.9.
Romans 10.13, 14. Iere. 17.5, 6, 7, 8.

Question.

Through whom must we make our prayers?

Answer.

Only through Jesus Christ: who is the only Mediator and Advocate, that

First, makes intercession for his people. 1. Tim. 2.5. 1. Ioh. 2.1, 2.

Secondly, makes their prayers acceptable unto God his Father, through the
sacrifice of himself. Reu. 8.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 5.20. Heb. 13.12, 13 14, 15.

Question.

Then it is not lawful to make our prayers unto Angels, Saints, or images: is
it?

Answer.

No; it were altogether sacrilege, and blasphemous so to do: for,

First, it robs God of his honor. Esa. 42.21, 22. Romans 2.12.

Secondly, it denies Christ to be the only Mediator and Advocate. 1. Tim.
2.5. 1. Ioh. 2.1, 2.

Thirdly, It is contrary to the commandment of God, and rule of Christ.
psalm. 50.15. Matthew. 6.9.

Fourthly, they are accursed that do it. Ier. 17.5.

Fifthly, they make thereby, as though Saints and Angels, were more ready to
help, and more merciful, than God our loving Father, and Christ our sweet
Savior.

Question.

By what rule must we frame our prayers?

Answer.

Only by the word of God. Matthew. 6.9. Luke 11.12.

Question.

Where shall we find the same?

Answer.

In the Lords Prayer.

Question.

Rehearse the same.

Answer.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc. Matt. 6.9.

Question.

Into how many parts may this prayer be divided?

Answer.

Two: as, First, in respect of Gods glory, in the three first petitions.
Secondly, in respect of our selves, in the three last petitions.


Also to this prayer belongs a preface, and a conclusion.

Question.

What learn you in the preface?

Answer.

First, unto whom God is a Father, namely unto them, that believe in the name
of Jesus Christ. John. 1.12, 13.

Secondly, seeing God is become their father (who is most merciful) it does

temptation, but deliver us from evil?

holiness, that we never be overcome of them. Ephe. 6.12, to 19. 1. Peter. 5.8.
Revel. 12.8, 9, 10.

Secondly, it shows how Christians, are at war with a cruel Lion, a
subtle serpent, and a continual accuser: therefore not to sleep in
security. 1. Pet. 5.8. Revel. 12.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

It is a perfect restoring unto the favor of God, through the obedience of our
only mediator Jesus Christ. 2. Cor. 5.19, 20, 21. Titus. 2.14.

Question.

What learn you out of this Article?

Answer.

First, that we are all vile sinners, and therefore need to seek for pardon.
Matthew. 18.24. Job. 14.4. 1. John. 1.8.

Secondly, that the remission of sins comes only by the sufferings of Christ.
1. Pe. 1.18, 19, 20, 21. Matthew. 26.26, 27.

Thirdly, that our sins being freely forgiven, shall be no more laid to our
charges to condemn us, for Christ has both died for us, and justified us.
Romans 8.32, 33, 34. Iere. 31.34. Heb. 10.16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

Thirdly, by whom that is, only through faith in Christ. John 6.47. Pet. 1.4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9. etc.

Question.

Why, is there no mention made in the articles of our faith, of the
resurrection of the wicked: with their punishment of body and soul, in hell
fire everlastingly?

Answer.

Because this sum of faith, respects only the benefits of faith,
belonging to the faithful in Jesus Christ.

Question.

Why? Shall not the wicked rise and be punished everlastingly?

Answer.

Yes verily: their bodies shall arise, and be joined to their souls, and so
punished in hell fire for evermore. Acts 24.15. John. 5.28, 29. 2. These. 1.8.
Revel. 20.8.

Question.

Now for good works: tell me, can we not merit Heaven of our selves by our
own good works?

Answer.

No verily: for so to think; were first to deny the grace of God. Ephe. 2.8.

Secondly, to say that Christ died in vain, and so, no savior. Gal. 2.21.

Thirdly, it fights against faith. Ga. 2.16.

Question.

Yea: but the Apostle says, God will reward every man, according to his
works? To. 2.

Answer.

It is true: God promises rewards for good deeds (not for the worthiness of
them but) for the grace wherewith God does embrace the believers, and does
crown his own gifts in them: also, to encourage us to walk obediently, and
fruitefullie, in all holiness before him and his people. Matthew. 25.33, etc. Romans
2.6, 7.

Question.

The Apostle S. Paul, bids us to work out our salvation, with fear and
trembling? Phil. 2.22.

Answer.

The same Apostle on the other side, tells us that salvation, faith, and good
works, are the free gifts of God. Ephe. 2.10. Titus 3.4, 5.

Question.

Why then does he bid us do the same, if we have not power to do it?

Answer.

The Apostle, in these words, seeks to take away all careless security from
Christians: and least that Christians should take too much upon them, he
sets down in the next verse following, that God must work both the will and
deed, and that of his own good pleasure without merit: withal in these words
he ministers a comfort to his people, in showing them, where they may have a
remedy to help their weakness and inhabilitie. Phil. 2.13.

Question.

If our sins deserve eternal death: then our good works deserve eternal
life?

Answer.

This is no good conclusion: for, if a man should reason thus: This man can
kill himself, therefore he can give himself life; may we not think him mad.
But this objection Paul the Apostle answers thus: The wages of sin is
death, but the gift of GOD, is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord:
withal, al good gifts proceed from God, evil things from us. Evil things are
perfectly evil: and our good works are imperfect and maimed. The reward of
the best of which is death. To. 6.23. 1. Cor. 13.9.

Question.

What then do you conclude?

Answer.

First, that eternal life, is the free gift of God by his mercies. Ephesians. 2.8.
Ti. 3.3, 5. To. 6.23.

Secondly, that by Christ's death and obedience we purchase it. To. 5.6. to the
end.

Thirdly, by faith, as the instrument to apprehend the same. John. 3.16. Gal.
2.16.

Fourthly, that we must glorify God, in all good works for our salvation.
Matthew. 5.16. 1. Pet. 2.12.

the same profitable unto us, that we may be fruitful in all knowledge, strong

may by us, be glorified, thy children comforted, and our souls and bodies in
Jesus Christ saved, grant us these things O merciful father for Christ's sake.

and blindness, and called us unto the unspeakable light and excellent knowledge
of thy self, as a dear and rich father, in Jesus Christ our redeemer: we
beseech thee increase our knowledge more and more, and make our hearts (which

when we were lost by thy rich mercy and sanctified us when we were poluted
and defiled in sin by thy free holiness, and have presently fed us by thy
plentiful and unspeakable goodness; be all honor, glory and power in Jesus
Christ. Amen.
