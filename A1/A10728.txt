wood cut of King Richard I on horseback.

The prologue.
Lord king of glory
Such grace and such vyctorye
Thou sendest to king Rychard
That never was found coward
It is good to here Iestes
Of his prowess and his conquestes
Many romans men make new
Of good knights and of true
Of their deeds men read romauns
Both in England and in France
Of Rowlande and of Olyuere
And of every defepere
Of Alysaunder and of Charlemayne
Of king Arthur and of Gawayne
How they were knights good and curtoys
Of Turpyn and of Oger the danoys
Of troy men read in ryme
What was by old time
Of Hector and of Achylles
What folk they slew in prees
In france these rymes were wrought
Every english ne knew it naught
Lewd man can frensshe none
Of an hundred uneath one
Nevertheless with glad chere
If that ye will now here
New Iestes I understand
Of doughty knights of England
Therefore now I will you read
Of a king doughty of deed
King Richard was the best
That is found in any Ieste
Now all that here this talking
God give them good ending
Here begins the hystorye of King Richard cure du lion / and first of his
birth.
Lords harken now beforne
How king Richard was borne
His fader was cleped king Harry
In his time sykerly
As I find in this saw
Saint Thomas was Islawe
At Caunterbury before the auter stone
There miracles be done many one
When he was.xx. winter old
He was a king swythe bold
He would no wife I understand
With great tresour though they her fond
Nevertheless his barons him read
That he granted them a wife to wedde
Hastily he sent his sonde
In to many a diverse land
The fairest woman that was on live
They should bring him to wyue
Messengers be ready dyght
To ship they went that same night
And their sail up they drowe
The wind them served well I now
And they came amyddes the sea
No wyndes brethe ne had he
Therefore they were swythe woe
Another ship they encountered tho
Such ne saw they never none
For it was so gay begone
Every nail with gold I grave
Of pure gold was his sklaue
Her mast was of Iuory
Of samyte her sail wytly
Her ropes all of white sylke
As white as ever was any milk
The noble ship was without
With clothes of gold spread about
And her lofte and her wyndlace
All with gold depaynted was
In the ship there were dyght
Knights and lords of might
And a lady therein was
Bright as son throw the glass
Her men abroad began stand
And becked them with her hand
And prayed them for to dwell
And their auentures to tell
They granted all with skyll
For to tell all her will
To diverse lands do we wend
For king Harry has us send
For to seche him a queen
The fairest that might on earth been
Up arose a king of a chair
With that word and spoke fair
The chair was of carbunkel stone
Such saw they never none
And other dukes him beside
Noble men of much pride
And welcomed the messengers euerychone
In to the ship they began gone
Thyrty knights without lie
Forsothe was in that company
In that rich ship they went
The messengers that were sent
Knights and ladies came them again
Seven score as men said
And welcomed them at one word
Clothes of sylke were spread on board
The king than anon badde
As it is in ryme radde
That his daughter were forth fet
And in a chair by him set
Trumpettes began to blow
She was set in a throw
With.xx. knights her about
And double so many of ladies stout
All they began to knele her to
For it was reason so to do
They ete and drank and were glad
For so the rich king bad
When they had done their mete
Of auentures they began to speak
The king them told in his reason
How it came him in a vysyon
In his land that he came fro
In to England for to go
And his daughter that was him dear
For to wend with him in fere
And in this manner we be dyght
Unto your land to wend right
Than answered a messengere
His name was cleped Barnagere
Ferther will we seek naught
To my lord she shall be brought
When he her with eyes does se
Full well apayed will he be
The wind rose out of the north west
And served them with the best
At the toure they began aryue
To land the knights went blyue
The messengers the king has told
Of that lady fair and bold
There he lay in toure
The lady that was white as flower
King Harry began him soon dyght
With earls barons and many a knight
Against that lady for to wend
For he was courteys and hende
The damoysell to land was ladde
Clothes of gold before her spradde
The messengers on each a side
And mynstrelles of much pride
King Harry lyked her seeing
That fair lady and her fader the king
And said to him right so
Ye be welcome all me to
To westmynster they went in fere
Lords ladies that there were
Trumpettes began for to blow
To mete they went in a throw
Knights there served a good speed
Of their mete to tell it is no need
And after mete in hyenge
Speaks Harry our king
To the king that sat in same
Good sir what is your name
My name he said is Carbarrynge
Of antyoche I am the king
He told him his reason
How him came in vysyon
Sir he said I tell the
I had brought else more meyne
Many mo without fail
And mo ships with vytayle
Yet asked he that lady bright
What name my lady ye hight
Cosodorean without lesynge
Thus answered she the king
Damoysell he said bright and shene
Will ye dwell and be my queen
She answered with words still
Sir I am at my faders will
Her fader granted swythe sone
At your will it shall be done
Hastily that she be wedde
As a queen to a kings bed
And prayed him for his courtesy
It might be done all pryuely
The spousynge was done that night
Thereat daunsed many a knight
Much Joy was then among
A priest full soon the mass song
And when it came to the leuacyowne
In a swounynge she fell down
The people than her sore a dradde
In to a chamber she was ladde
She said for I am thus hent
I dare never se the sacrament
Upon the more her fader took leave
No longer would he there be leave
The king dwelled with his queen
Children they had them between
Two sons and a maid
Forsothe as the book us said
Richard hight the first Iwys
Wherefore these romans made is
And Johan forsothe that other was
And their sister hight Copyas
Thus they dwelled in fere
Till the.xv. year
Upon a day before the rode
The king at his mass stood
There came an earl of great post
Sir he said how may this be
That my lady the queen
The sacrament dare not seen
Give us leave to do her dwell
Fro the beginning of the gospel
Till the mass be song and said
And than shall ye se a queynt brayd
The king granted with good will
For to hold her with strength still
Neither for well ne for woo
Let her not out of the church goo
And when the bell began to ring
The priest should make the sakerynge
Out of the church she would away
But the earl said soon nay
He said lady thou shalt abide
For any thing that may betyde
She took her daughter upon her hand
And Johan her sone she would not wonde
Out of the rofe she began her dyght
Openly before all their sight
Johan fell from her in that stand
And brake his thygh on the ground
And with her daughter she fled her way
That never after she was I sey
The king wondered of that thing
That she made such an ending
For love that she was served so
Would he never after come there ne go
He let ordeyne after his ending
H^s sone Richard to be king
Crowned after king Harry
Thus was Richard sykerly
That was in his.xv. year
He was a man of great powere
Deeds of arms he gave him to
As falls for kings and knights to do
He waxed so strong and so wight
Against him had no man no might
In every stead he took honor
As a noble king and conqueroure
How king Richard made a Iustynge.
woodcut of a joust

THe first year that he was king
At Salysbury he made a Iustynge
And commanded every man to be there
Both with shield and with spear
Earls and barons euerychone
At home ne dwelled never one
On forfeyture on life and land
For nothing that they ne wonde
This was cried I understand
Thorughout all England
All was for to look and se
The knights that best might be
There they came all at his will
His commandment to fulfill
The parties were sonder set
Together they ran without let
King Richard began him dysguyse
In a full strong queyntyse
He came out of a valaye
For to se of their play
As a knight auenturous
His atyre was orgulous
All together cole black
Was his horse without lack
Upon his creste a raven stood
That yaned as he were wode
And about his neck a bell
Wherefore the reason I shall you tell
The oynge of the raven is
In trauayll for to be Iwys
Sygnyfyaunce of the bell
With holy church to dwell
And them to noy and to grieve
That be not in the right believe
He bare a shalt that was great and strong
It was fourtene foot long
And it was great and stout
One and twenty inches about
The first knight that he there met
Full egerly he him grette
With a dente amyd the shield
His horse he bare down in the field
And the knight fell to ground
Full nigh deed in that stounde
The next that he met their
A great stroke he him bare
His forgette with his cornell tho
His neck he brake there a two
His horse and he fell to ground
And dyed both in that stounde
King Richard began houe and abide
If any mo would to him ride
Trumpettes began for to blow
Knights Iusted in that row
Another knight hardy and good
Sat on a stead read as blood
He did him arm and well dyght
In all that longed to such a knight
A shafte he took great and louge
That was so heavy and strong
And said he would to him ride
If he durst him abide
Trumpettes began to blow than
Thereby wyste many a man
That they should Just mere
The noble knights that there were
King Richard of him was ware
And aspere to him he bare
And encountered him in the field
He bare away half his shield
His pusen therewith began gone
And also his brandellet bone
His vyser and his gorgere
Him repented that be came there
King Richard houed and beheld
And thought to rest him in the field
If there were other knight or swayne
That would more ride him again
He saw there would come none
On his way he began forth gone
Into a wode out or their light
And in another tire he him dyght
Upon a stead read as blood
With all the tire that on him stood
Horse and shield armure and man
That no man should know him than
Upon his creste a read hounde
The tail henge to the ground
That was sygnyfycacyon
The hethen folk to bring down
Them to slay for gods love
And christian men to bring above
Still he houed and bode yore
To them he thought to ride more
He rode the thronge all about
He held within and without
A baron he saw him beside
Toward him he began ride
To asquyer he took his spear
To him he would it not bear
Forth he took a mansell
A stroke he thought to be set well
On his helm that was so strong
Of that dente the fire out spronge
The baron turned him aside
And said fellow forth thou ride
With thy speres go and play
Come no more here I the pray
And syketly if thou do
Thou shalt have a knock or two
King Richard wondered in his thought
That he set his stroke at naught
And came again by another way
And thought to make a better pay
In his styrope up he stood
And smote to him with Ire full mode
He set his stroke on his iron hat
But that other in his sadell sat
Hastily without words mo
His mase he took in his hand tho
That was made of yotyn bras
He wondered who that it was
Such a stroke he him lent
That Richard feet out of his steropes went
For plate ne for acketton
For hawberke ne for campeson
Such a stroke he never had none ore
That did him half so much sore
Full swythe away he began ride
Out of the prees there beside
To him self he said tho
Of such strokes keep I no mo
He went adowne to a well
And with his helm drank his fell
And he watered his stead also
In the third atyre he let him do
All his atyre white as milk
His croper was of sylke
Upon his shulder a cross read
That betokens gods deed
With his enemies for to fight
To win the cross if that he might
Upon his heed a dove white
Sygnyfycacyon of the holy spyryte
To be bold to win the pryse
And dystroye gods enemies
To the king Richard began him dyght
Than another noble knight
Fouke doly was his name
The king him loved for his fame
To him a stroke he dyght
Well to pay with all his might
He smote him on his bassenet
A great dente without let
It swouned to his cheke bone
Sir Fouke bad him forth gone
That he no longer abide
In adventure if any stroke betyde
The king saw he felt no sore
And thought to give him more
And another stroke he him brayde
His mase upon his heed he laid
With good will that stroke he set
The baron thought he would him let
And with his heavy mase of stele
There he gave the king his dele
That his helm all to roue
And he over his sadell drove
And his steropes he forbear
Such a stroke had he never are
He was so astonyed of that dente
That nigh he had his life lent
And for that stroke that him was given
He ne wist whether it was day or even
Tho he recovered of his swowe
To his palace he him drowe
Than he commanded hastily
Herodes for to make cry
And every man for to wend
Home to his own friend
The king anon a messengere
Full preuely he sent there
To sir Thomas of multon
That was a noble baron
And to sir Fouke dely
That they come to him on hye
Let them not dwell in no manner
Bydde them come both in fere
The messengers therewith went
And said the king after them sent
Swythe for to come him to
Without delay that it be do
The knights hyed and were blythe
To the king they went swythe
And hendly they him grette
And he them took and by him set
And said to them words free
Welcome be ye now to me
In either hand he took one
And in to a chamber they gone
Quod Richard sweet friends twaye
Tell me the sothe I you pray
What knights that rode best course
Of this Iustes paramours
And which could best his craft
For to demene well his shafte
With dentes for to fell his foos
Which of them wan the loos
And who styffest tymbre brake
Quod Thomas one in attire blake
Came pryckynge over falowe and field
All that there was him beheld
How he rode as he were wode
A rome he houed and withstode
On his creste a raven swarte
And he ne held with neither part
A shafte he bare styfe and strong
Fourtene foot it was long
It was both styffe and stout
Anon he asked all the route
If any durst come and prove
A course for his lemmans love
With a knight of auenturous here
A young knight a Ioly bachelere
Hente a shafte and stead bestrode
To the auenturous knight he rode
The auenturous with him met
Such a stroke on his shield he set
That horse and man ouerthrewe
There was no wight that him knew
Trompettes yede herodes gaderynge
All the other knights of him had dredynge
To Just with him efte with lance
The auenturous betyde so fair chance
And hardy knight stout and savage
Hente a shafte with strong rage
Now has he one of ours field
Worth we never for men telde
Sith he has done us that dyspyte
If he again pass quyte
That first he have no knock
He prycked forth fro all the flock
With a shafte stout and square
Amydde the course than met they their
The auenturous smote his shield amydde
A wonders case our knight betydde
The auenturous field him with Ire
Down of his stead and brake his swyre
The three knights to speak began
This is the devil and no man
That our folk felleth and sleeth
Tide me life tide me deeth
I shall mete him if I may
The auenturous knight with great deray
So hard to our knight he drove
His shield in two pieces he cloue
His shulder with his shafte he bracke
And bare him over his horse back
That he fell down and brake his arm
He did him no more harm
The auenturous tho turned ayene
And houed still for to seen
Who would Just with him more
Of him they were adradde full sore
No man durst Just with him efte
Lest he them their life berefte
When he saw there came no mo
He rode again there he came fro
After the black another came
All the folk gave him good name
His horse and his atyre was read
He seemed well to be a quede
A read hounde on his helm above
He came to seche and to prove
If any knight Just with him dare
Of no man tho was he ware
That him made challenge
He rode down tho by the renge
The devil him hang where ever he be
I wot not what him ayled at me
His shafte tho his squyre he took
And beheld me with a grym look
And smote me so with his mase
Ne had be Ihesu crystes grace
My swyre had gone away
I bad him ride forth his way
And dele with foles as his self was
Again he came by another pas
And gave me a worse buffate
But still in my sadell I sat
Than said many a moders sone
Alas sir Thomas of multone
That is smyten without skyll
My mase I hente with good will
And smote him that all folks say
Down of his horse withouten nay
When I had him a stroke set
And would have blyssed him bet
No mo strokes would he abide
But away soon he began ride
When multon had his tale told
Sir Fouke doly a baron bold
Said to king Richard
The third there came soon afterward
His atyre was white as snow
Thereof many one there low
In his shield a cross read as blood
A white dove on his helm stood
He houed still and beheld us yerne
if there were any knight so stern
So hardy a man and strong of bones
That durst Just with him ones
There was none so stout ne grym
That durst Just ones with him
Down by the renge he went fast
To me he came at the last
Forsothe sir king quod Fouke than
I wend he had been a simple man
With his mase on my bassenet
A stroke upon my helm he set
With wrath strong and eger main
That nygh all astonyed was my brain
I spoke to him words few
And badde him ride worth wood shrewe
And play with them that be thy pere
if thou come often in this manner
For to be wise I shall the teache
Efte he came again to seche
A worse stroke he gave me tho
And my mase I drew me to
And a stroke I him set
Even upon his bassenet
That both his styropes he lose
And he hyed him fast out of the prese
Home toward the wodde bow
King Richard sat and fast low
And said friends sykerly
Take it not in grefe for it was I
When ye were gadred in fere
Auenturous I came in this manner
Who was strongest you to assaye
And who that could best strokes pay
Lords he said wot ye ought
What I have ordained in thought
The holy land to wend to
We three without any mo
All in palmers guyse
The holy land to deuyse
Come I would that ye were sworn
No man to know it that is borne
Neither for well ne for woo
Till that we be come and goo
They granted him his asking
Without any withsayenge
With him to live and to dye
Lettynge for love ne for envy
On the book they laid their hand
To that forward for to stand
Tho they asked all three
True sworn for to be
Trompettes blewe and made cry
To mete they went hastily
And on the.xii. day at end
They were ready for to wend
With pycke and with slauayne
As palmers or panayme
How king Richard took shyppynge.
woodcut of two figures at a dock

NOw they dyght them full yare
These three knights for to fare
They set up sail ye wind was good
And sailed over the salt flood
In to flaunders as I you say
King Richard and his feres twaye
Forth they went with glad chere
Thorugh many lands far and nere
Till they came to blaundys
That is a cost of much pryse
A noble ship they found their
Over the sea for to fare
The sail was raised in the ship strong
And in the sea they were long
There they dwelled forty days
For to learn the lands lays
Sith they did them to the sea
Toward Acrys that rich cite
And so forth to masydoyne
And to the cite of Babyloyne
And so forth to sysare
Of nynyue they were ware
And also of Iherusalem
And to the cite of bedleem
And to the cite of gandon turry
And also to obedy
And to the castle of orgulous
And to the cite of apparylous
To Iaffe and to saffrayne
To bright and to betayne
Thus they vysyted the holy land
How they might it win to their hand
And sith homewarde they them dyght
To england with all their might
When they had passed the greeks see
In almayne the palmers three
There they wrought or they thens might goo
That turned them to much woo
I shall you tell in what manner
Now harken all that been here
Agoos they dyght to their dynere
In a tavern there they were
King Richard the fire fet
And Thomas to the spytte him set
Fouke doly made the bose
Full dear bought they the gose
And as they were etynge their fill
An one there came in a mynstryll
And said good men sykerly
Will ye have any mynstrelsy
King Richard bad him thens go
That turned them to much woe
The mynstrell took that in mind
And thought that they were unkind
And if I may they shall forthynke
For they bad me neither ete ne drink
For gentylles should bydden
To glee men that about yeden
Of their mete wine or ale
For lose ryseth of mynstrale
They were english well he knew
By speech and sight hyde and hew
For he went in that tide
To a castle there beside
And told the king all and some
That three men were to the cite come
Strong men bold and fere
In the world is not their pere
Kynke Richard of england was the one man
Fouke doly was that other than
The third Thomas of Multon
Noble knights of renown
In palmers wede they be dyght
That no man should know them right
To him said the king Iwys
That thou haste if it sothe is
Thou shalt have thy warysowne
And chose thy self a rich town
The king commanded his knights
To arm them in all myghtes
And go and take them all three
And swythe bring them to me
Forth went the knights in fere
And took the palmers at their dynere
They were brought before the king
And he asked them in hyenge
Palmers he said whens be ye
Of England they said we be
What hight thou falowe said the king
Richard he said without lesynge
What hight thou he said to the elder man
Fouke doly he answered than
And what thou he said gray here
Thomas of multon he said there
The king asked them all three
What they did in his country
I say you without lies
Ye seem well to be spies
Ye have seen my land up and down
I trow ye think me some treasowne
For as much as thou sir king
And thy barons without lesynge
Seem not to be thus dyght
Therefore ye shall with law and right
Ben not in a strong prison
For ye think to do me treason
King Richard said so mote I the
Thou does unright thinks me
Palmers that gone by the way
Them to prison night or day
Sir king for thy courtesy
Do us palmers no vylony
For his love that we have songht
Let us go and grieve us naught
For auentures that may betyde
In strange lands where thou ride
The king commanded anon
In to prison them to done
The porter I understand
Took Richard by the hand
And his felawes with him tyte
Longer had they no respyte
Till that other day at pryme
The kings sone came in evil time
Wardrewe was his name
He was a knight of great fame
He was great strong and fere
In that land was not his pere
Porter he said I pray the
Thy prisoners let me see
The porter said all at your will
Erly or late loud or still
He brought them forth all three
Richard formest tho came he
Wardrewe spoke to him than
Art thou Richard the strong man
As men say in each land
Darste thou stand a buffet of my hand
And to morrow I give the leave
Such another me to give
Anon king Richard
Granted to that forward
The kings sone fyers and proute
Gave Richard an eere cloute
The fire out of his eyes spronge
Richard thought he did him wrong
And swear his oath by saint Martyn
To morrow I shall pay mine
The kings sone with good will
Badde they should have their fill
Both of drink and eke of mete
The best that they would ete
That they might not a wit
For feebleness his dente to smite
And in to bed be brought to rest
To quyte his that he be priest
The kings sone was curtese
That night he made him well at ease
On the morrow when it was day
Richard rose as I you say
Wax he took clear and bright
And sone a fire he him dyght
And wexed his hondes by the fire
Ouerthwarde and endlonge be you sure
A strawes bread thycke and more
For he thought to smite sore
With his hand he has tyght
To make a pain that he has hight
The kings sone came in than
To hold forward as a true man
And before Richard he stood
And spoke to him with Ire full mode
Smite he said with thy might
Thou have I fared well this night
And if I stope or field
Keep me never to bear shield
Under his cheke Recharde his hand laid
He that it saw the sothe said
Flesh and skin away he tare
That he fell down in great care
He all to brake his cheke bone
That he was deed as any stone
A knight sterte to the king
And told him that tydynge
Thar Richard had his sone sloo
Alas he said how shall I do
With that word he fell to ground
As a man that was in woe bound
He foundred and lost his fete
Knights took him up without let^
And said sir let be thy thought
Now it is it done helps naught
The king spoke words on hye
To the knights that stood him bye
Tell me swythe of this cas
In what manner that it done was
Still they stood euerychone
For sorrow might they tell none
With that noise came the queen
Alas she said how may this been
Why is this sorrow and this fare
Who has brought you in care
Dame he said wotest thou naught
Thy fair sone to death is brougth
Sith I was borne to man
Such sorrow had never woman
All my Joy is turned to woo
For sorrow I would my self sloo
When the queen understood
For great care she waxed ny wode
Her kerchers she drew and here also
Alas she said what shall I do
She cratched her self in the vysage
As a woman that was in a rage
She fomed all on blood
And rent her robe that she in stood
And said alas that I was borne
That thus my sone have forlorn
Lord she said how may this be
These knights he said told it me
Now tell the sothe the king said than
In what manner say ye this deed began
And but ye the sothe sey
An evil death shall ye dey
The knights called the Iaylere
And badde he should stand nere
To bear wytnes of that saw
In what manner he was slawe
The Iayler said yesterdaye at pryme
Your sone came in an evil time
To the prison door to me
And the palmers he would se
And I fet them forth anon
Richard formest began gone
Wardrewe asked without let
If he would stand him a buffet
And he him would another stand
As he was true knight in land
Richard said by this light
Smite on with all thy might
Richard had such a stroke of Wardrewe
That full nygh he him ouerthrewe
Richard he said now bydde I the
To morrow another thou give me
They departed in this wise
On the morrow Richard began to rise
And your sone anon came
And Richard against him name
As covenant was between them twain
Richard smote the sothe to said
Even all a two his cheke bone
That he fell deed as any stone
And as I am sworn to you here
Thus it was in this manner
The king said with eger will
In prison they shall be still
And fetters upon their fete feste
For this deed done vnwreste
And for he has my sone slawe
He shall dye by right law
The Iaylere yede as he was sent
To do the kings commandment
That day ete they no mete
Nor no drink might they get
The kings daughter lay in her boure
With ladies and maidens of honor
Margery her name hight
She looked Richard with all her might
At the mydde day before the none
To the prison she went soon
With her went maidens three
Porter she said let me se
The prisoners hastily
Blythly he said sykerly
He brought them forth anon right
Fair they grette that lady bright
And said to her with heart fre
With us lady what will ye
When she saw Richard with her eyes two
Her love she cast upon him tho
She said Richard save god above
Of all thing most I the love
Alas quod Richard in that stounde
With wrong I am brought to ground
I poor prisoner as ye may se
What may my love do to the
This is the third day agone
That mete nor drink had I none
The lady had of him pity

Of the love between ye kings daughter and king Richard / and after how that
king Richard slew a lion / and how he ete the heart of the lion all raw /
wherefore he had the name / strong king Richard cure de lion

ANd after souper in the evening
To my chamber thou Richard bring
In the tire of a squyere
My self I shall keep him there
By Ihesu christ and by saint Simon
Thou shalt have thy waryson
The Iayler forgate it naught
To her chamber he him brought
With that maid he dwelled still
And played with her his will
Till the seventh day sykerly
He yede and came pryuely
He was aspyed of a knight
That to the chamber he came right
Pryuely he told the king
That forlayne was his daughter yinge
The king asked him soon
Who has he said that deed done
Richard he said that traitor
He has done you the dishonor
Sir he said by my crystendome
I saw when he went and come
The king in heart syghed sore
To him spoke he tho no more
But swythe without fail
Sent after his counsel
Earls and barons and wise clerks
For to counseyll him of his works
The messengers began forth gone
His counseyliours came anon
By that it was the.xiiii. day
They were come as I you say
All at ones they grette the king
Sothe to say without lesynge
He said lords welcome be ye all
He went forth in to the hall
Among them the king him set
I shall you tell without let
Why I have after you sent
To give a traitor Judgment
That has done great treason
King Richard that is in my prison
All he them told in his saw
How he had his sone I slawe
And he were deed than were I feign
For he shall never home again
And now it is ordained so
Men shall no king to death do
To him spoke a bold baron
How came king Richard in your prison
He is holden so noble a king
To him dare no man do thing
The king told him in all wise
How he him found and in what guyse
And with him other two barons
Noble men of great renouns
I took them through suspeccyon
In this manner to my prison
He took leave of them euerychone
In to a chamber he bad them gone
For to take their counsel
That them might best avail
In their speech they dwelled thore
Two days and somdele more
And strove as they were wode
With great error and with great mode
Some would him hang and draw
And some said it was no law
On this manner to slay a king
They ne might accord for no thing
The wysest said verament
We will give him no Judgment
Thus answered they the king
Sir grieve you no thing
For sir Eldrede forsothe Iwys
He can you tell what best is
For he is a wise man of read
That many a man has dampened to deed
The king badde without let
That he were before him fette
He was brought before the king
The which him axed at his coming
Can thou me tell in what manner
On Richard that I avenged were
He answered I tell the
Thereon I must auyse me
Ye wot well it is no law
A king to hang ne to draw
Therefore do by my reason
Hastily take your lion
And with hold him his mete
Three days that he none ete
And Richard in a chamber do
And put the lion than him to
In this manner he shall be slawe
Than do thou not against the law
The lion there shall him sloo
Than art thou awreked of thy foo
The maid aspyed of that reasone
And than bethought her soon
And after him soon she sent
To warn him of that Judgment
When he to her chamber came than
Welcome she said my lemman
My lord has ordained thorugh read
The third day thou shalt be deed
In to a chamber thou shalt be do
And a lion shall be put the to
That shall have honger sore
Than wot I well thou lyuest no more
But sweet lemman said she their
Let us out of this land fare
With gold and silver and much money
I naught to spend than have I
Richard said I understand
That were against the law of land
Away to wend without leave
The king I will not so grieve
Of the lion give I naught
Him to slay have I thought
By pryme upon the third day
I will have his heart to pray
Kerchers he asked of sylke
Forty else as white as milk
In to the prison ye them bring
A little before the evening
When it to the time came
The maid to prison the way name
And with her a noble knight
Their souper was ready dyght
Richard and his tway fere
Had y naught to their soupere
And the porter also
She bad he should so do
That night they were glad ynowe
Every man sith to chamber drowe
And Richard and that sweet wight
Together dwelled all that night
And on the morrow when it was day
Richard badde her to wend away
Nay she said by god above
I shall here dye for thy love
Right now here I will abide
Though I should to death betyde
Certes hens will I not wend
I shall take the grace that god will send
Richard said fair lady free
But thou wend soon from me
Thou shalt me grieve sore
That I shall love the no more
There against she said nay
Lemman have now good day
God that dyed on the tree
Save the if his will be
The keuerthefes he took on hand
And about his arm he wonde
And thought in that ylke while
To slay the lion with some gyle
And syngle in a kyrtell he stood
And abode the lion fyers and wode
With that came the Iaylere
And other men that with him were
And the lion them among
His paws were styffe and strong
The chamber door they undone
And the lion to him is gone
Richard said help lord Ihesu
The lion made to him venu
And would him have all to rent
King Richard beside him glente
The lion on the breast him spurned
That about he turned
The lion was hongry and megre
And bette his tail to be egre
He looked about as he were mad
Abroad he all his paws spradde
He cried loud and yaned wide
King Richard bethought him that tide
What him was best and to him sterte
In at the throat his hand he gerte.
And hente out the heart with his hand
Lounge and all that he there fond
The lion fell deed to the ground
Richard felt no wem ne wound
He fell on his knees in that place
And thanked Ihesu of his grace
That him kept from shame and harm
He took the heart also warm
And brought it forth in the hall
Before the king and his lords all
The king at mete sat at the dese
The earls barons proud in prese
The salt on the table stood
King Richard thryste out all the blood
And wette the heart in the salt
The king and his men him behalte
Without bread he it began ete
The king wondered and began to speak
Iwys as I understand can
This his the devil and no man
He has my strong lion slawe
The heart out of the body draw
And has it eten with good will
He may be called with good skyll
Christian king most of renown
Strong Richard cure delyowne
How king Richard sent for his ransom
woodcut of a messanger delivering a letter

NNow of this let we be
And of the king speak we
In care and mourning ledeth his life
And often calls himself caytyfe
And cursed the time yt he was borne
For his sone has he forlorn
And his daughter is forlayne
And this his lion is thus slain
Earls and barons came him to
And the queen did also
And asked what he was
ye wot he said all the cas
Why that I am in sorrow this hour
Hor Richard that strong traytoure
He has wrought me so much woo
And I ne may him to death do
Therefore I will at this sake
Raunsom for his body take
For my daughter that is I shente
Against the estate of sacrament
Of every church that prestes in sing
And matyns sing and belles ring
There that two chalys be
That one shall be brought to me
If there be more than two
The half dele shall come me to
When I am served of that fe
Than shall Richard delivered be
And my daughter for her outrage
Shall for goo her heritage
Thus he said it shall be do
The barons granted all thereto
King Richard they after sent
For to here their ordaynemente
When he came in to the hall
He great the king and his men all
The king said verament
We have looked your Judgment
That thou shalt pay raunsones
For the and for thy barons
Of every church in thy land
Thou shalt do come to my hand
There that two chalys in be
That one shall be brought to me
And if there be more than two
The half dele shall be brought me to
Thorugh thy land wit it well
I will have the half dele
And when thou haste made thy pay
I give the leave to wend thy way
And my daughter with the also
That again I se her never mo
King Richard said as thou have told
To that forward I me hold
King Richard curteys and hende
Said who shall for my raunsom wend
To England to my chauncelere
That my raunsom paid were
Who that it does without fail
I shall him quyte for his travail
Up there sterte an hende knight
Thy message I will do full right
The king did a letter write
A good clerk did it endyte
And made there in mencyon
Less and more of that raunson
Great well as I you say
Mine archebysshoppes twaye
And so ye do my chauncelere
To serve this letter in all manner
For no thing that they ne fail
Sykerly it shall them avail
His seal thereon he has set
The knight it took without let
He dyght him and made him yare
In to England for to fare
When he was over the se brought
To go his way forgate he naught
To London he yede anon
There he found them euerychone
He took the letter as I you say
To the archebysshoppes twaye
And bad them to do it read
For it is sent for great need
The chaunceler the seal brake
Soon they wyste what it spoke
The letter was read among them all
What thereof should befall
How king Richard with treason
In almayne dwelled for raunson
The kings sone he has slain
And his douhhter eke forlayne
And also slain his lyone
All these arms has he done
They made clerks for to wend
To every church fair and hende
Hastily that it were spedde
And the treasour to him led
Messenger now said he
Thou shalt dwell and have with the
Five bysshoppes to ride the by
And five barons sykerly
And other folk enough with the
In us no defaute shall be
Of every church less and more
They gadered that treasore
And over the sea they went
For to make that fair present
And when they came the cite to
The king there they found tho
And said as they were bethought
Sir thy raunsom is hither brought
Take it all at your will
Let go these men as it is skyll
The king said I give them leave
I shall them no more grieve
And took his daughter by the hand
And bad her swythe void the land
The queen saw what would fall
Her daughter to her she began call
And said thou shalt dwell with me
Till Richard send after the
As a king does after his queen
Thus I read that it been
King Richard and his feres twaye
To England took their way
Now they be come to England
Blessed be Ihesu crystes sonde
He went to London to that cite
His earls and his barons fre
Thanked god of his good grace
That their king was in that place
His two feres went right soon home
Their friends were glad that they come
They bathed their bodies that were sore
For trauayll that they had had before
Thus they dwelled half a year
Among their friends of great powere
Till they were able for to stand
The king commanded thorugh the land
At London to make a parlyament
Of his comyns and lords gent
As they would save their life
Or their children or their wife
To London to his sommon
Came bysshoppes earls and many a baron
Abbottes pryours knights and squyers
Burgeyses and many bachelors
All the best of his land
The kings heste to understand
Before that time the great country
That was before the greeks see
Acrys and surrey and many lands
Were in christian men's hondes
And the country of Bedleem
And also Iherusalem
And Nazareth and Ieryco
And all Galyce thereto
Every palmer and pilgrim
That would theder go that time
Might pass with good entente
Without raunsom or any rent
Other of silver or of gold
To every stead where they would
Found he no man to myssayne
Neither no hondes on him layne
Of surrey land the duke myllon
Was lord in that stounde a bold baron
Maugre the sowdan the land he held
And kept it well with spear and shield
He and the doughty earl Reynawte
Full often gave him hard assawte
And full often in battle
Slew his knights and pewtayll
Of sarasynes that mysbyleued
The sowdan thereof was agreued
Now harken of a treason strong
Of the earl Roys was them among
To whom the duke myllon trust mekle
And he was a traitor false and fekle
The sowdan still to him sent
And he asked him lands and rent
The christian host to betraye
Who he has won him to pay
Of gold many a thousand pound
And he granted him that stounde
Another traitor Marks feraunt
He wyste also of that covenant
And after his crystendome forsook
And to the devil him betoke
And thorugh treason of the earl Roys
Surrey was lorne and the holy croys
The dukes reward was hew small
All to pieces says our tale
The duke myllon was full life
He fled out of the land with his wife
He was earl of surrey land
King bawdewyns sone I understand
That no man wyste never sithe
Where he became ne in what kythe
So this loss and this pity
Spronge in to all crystente
An holy pope that hight Urban
Sent to all crystendome than
And assoyled them of their sin
And gave them paradyse to win
All that will theder gone
To wreke Ihesu of his fone
The king of france without fail
Theder went with much vytayle
The duke of bloys the duke of burgon
The duke of estryche the duke of fusson
And also the Emperor of almayne
And many good knights of brytayne
The earl of flaunders the earl of babelyne
The earl of arteys the earl of Colyne
Much folk went theder before
That nygh had their lives lore
With great war and honger hard
As ye may here afterward
In harvest after the natyuyte
King Richard with great solempnyte
At westmynster he held a noble feste
With bysshoppes and barons honest
Abbottes pryours and swynes strong
After mete yede them among
King Richard stood up and began said
My self friends will you said
Be in pease and harken unto my tale
Earls barons great and small
Bishops abbotte lewd and learned
All crystendome may be afered
The pope Urban has us sent
By bull and by commandment
How the sowdan has fight begone
The town of Acrys is I won
Thorugh the earl Roys treachery
All the kingdom of surry
Iherusalem and the cross is lorne
And bedleem there Ihesu was borne
Christian knights be hanged and draw
The sarasynes has them all slawe
Christian men wife and grome
Therefore my lord pope of Rome
Is sore agreued and anoyed
That crystendome is so dystroyed
All crystendome he has sent and bod
And byddeth them in the name of god
To wend theder with great host
For to fell the sarasynes boost
Wherefore I have mente
To wend theder with swerdes dente
To win the cross and get the lose
Friends what is your purpose
Will ye wend say ye or nay
Earl baron knight and all that may
They said we ben at one accord
With the to wend Richard our lord
Quod Richard friends gramercy
It is our honor lysteneth why
The king of france is went forth
Ryden este and weste south and north
Thorugh England we will do cry
And make a plain treasourye
Much folk the cross have nome
And to king Richard ben come
On horse and on foot well apparaylled
Three hundred ships well vytaylled
Hawberkes swerdes and knyues
Thyrty ships laden benlyues
Of tembre great and sheldes long
He let make a toure strong
That queynte engyners made
Therewith three ships were lade
Another ship was laden yet
With a gynne that hight robynet
With Richard a mangenell
With all the takell that thereto fell
When they were dyght and yare
Out of the heaven for to fare
Ihesu them sent wind so good
To bear them over the salt flood
King Richard said to his shypmen
Friends do as I you ken
And master Alyn trenchmere
Where that ye come far and nere
And ye mete by the sea stronde
Ships of any other land
Christian men on live and lymme
Look that ye no good benymme
And if ye the sarasyns mete
Look on live that ye none let
Catell dormonde or galaye
Also I give it to your pray
But at the cite of maryle
There ye must abide a while
By cable and auncker there to ride
Me and mine host there to abide
For I and my knights and eke swayne
Will wend thorugh out all almayne
To speak with Medarde the king
To wot why and for what thing
That he me in his prison held
And but he my treasour again yield
That he took of me with falsshede
I shall acquyte him his mede
Now thinks Richard as I wene
Or he fether goth avenged to been
Thus king Richard as ye may here
Became gods palmere
Against his enemies
The archebysshop sir bawdemys
Before went with knights five
By bourdes and by constantyue
At the last there afterward
Came the doughty king Rychrde
King Richard called his Iustyse
Lo ye do at my deuyse
My land keep with skyll and law
Traitors look ye hang and draw
In my stead shall ye be here
The bishop of York my chauncelere
I will it be at his will
To work after right and skyll
That I here after here no strife
As ye will save my life
And in name of god almyght
I bydde you rule the poor a right
There they held up their hand
With right to rule all England
The bishop them gave his blessing
And bad for them in church to sing
And prayed Ihesu christ him speed
In heaven to quyte him his mede
Three hoostes king Richard let make
To hethenesse for gods sake
In the formest ward he would be
With hardy men of great post
That other ledeth Fouke doly
Thomas the third certainly
And every host began with him led
Forty thousand good at need
None therein but men of might
That were proud in war to fight
When they were passed the se
Sone he deled his host in three
For he would not the folk anoye
Ne their goods not dystroye
Ne no thing take without pay
The king commanded also I say
Every host from other ten mile
Thus he ordained that wyle
In the myddell him to ride
And his hoostes abothe side
Forth he went with glad chere
Thorugh lands far and nere
Till they came without ensoyne
Unto the cite of coloyne
The high mayre of that cite
Commanded as I tell the
That no man should sell him vytayle
For no thing that might avail
The steward told Richard the king
Soon anon of that tydynge
That he ne might no vytayle bye
Neither for love ne for monye
Thus defended Medarde the king
For he the hates over all thing
And well he woteth that ye have swore
All that ye take for to pay fore
Ye will take with no maystry
Therefore he weneth sykerly
That ye ne shall have mete none
Thus he weneth thy men to stone
King Richard said also him thought
That he ne shall let us naught
Steward I command the
Bye us vessel great plente
Dysshes cups and sawcers
Bolles trowes and platters
Fattes cowles and costrelles
Make our mete without les
Whether ye will sethe or bake bread
And to poor men so god you read
That ye find in all the town
That they come to mete at my sommowne
When the mete was dressed and dyght
The king commanded to a knight
After the meyre for to wend
And other barons good and hende
Anon they were to the board set
And fair service before them fet
King Richard asked in hyenge
Sir meyre where is thy lord the king
Sir he said at gonorye
Sykerly without lie
And also my lady the queen
The third day ye shall them seen
And margery his daughter fre
That of thy coming blythe will be
They wysshe as it is law in land
A menssenger there came dryuande
Upon a stead white as milk
All I trapped in tuly sylke
With five hundred belles ryngynge
He came full merly singing
And down of his stead he alyght
And grette king Richard aplyght
The kings daughter that is so fre
She the greteth well by me
With an hundred knights and mo
She comes or ye to bed go
King Richard said hyenge
She is welcome over all thing
He made at ease the messengere
With glad semblaunt and merry chere
And gave him a clothe of gold
For he was with his lady withholde
They came to him that same night
The knights and that lady bright
When king Richard might hearse
Welcome lemman than said he
Either other began to kiss
And made much Joy and bliss
There they left till it was day
On the morrow they went their way
And at myddaye before the none
They came before a cite right soon
The name was hight marburent
There the king Richard most lent
Soon his steward came him to
Sir he said how shall we do
Such vytayll as I bought yesterday
For no gold get it I ne may
King Richard said with heart fre
Of fruit here is great plente
Fygges and reysyns in frail
And nuttes may serve us rather than fail
And wexe somdele cast thereto
Talowe and greece I meddled also
And thus ye may our mete make
Sithe that we may none other take
There they dwelled all that night
On the morrow to wend as it was right
Unto the cite of carpentras
There king Medarde him self was
For there might he him flee naught
Thorugh the land he had him sought
The king wyste Richard was come
Well he wend to ben I none
And in prison ay to be
But if my daughter help me
She came to him there he sat
What now fader what is that
Certes daughter I get blame
But thou me help I get shame
Certes sir she said than
As I am gentylwoman
If ye will be mylde of mode
King Richard shall do you but good
But grant me with good will
That he will say to fulfill
And you in his mercy does
And he you kiss shall without oath
And also my lady the queen
Good friends shall ye been
She took her fader and with him yede
To king Richard as I you read
And eke earls and barons mo
And fyfty knights eke also
King Richard saw how that he came
Fair against him the way he name
King Medarde on knees him set
And king Richard there he grette
And said I am at thy will
Quod Richard I will naught but skyll
But so thou yield again my tresore
I shall the love ever more
Love the and be thy friend
Quod king Medarde my sone hende
I shall the swear upon a book
Ready is that I of the took
And if thou will much more
Of mine own tresore
I will the give my peace to make
King Richard began him in arms take
And kyste him many times sithe
They were friends and made blythe
That every day king Medarde
Ere with king Richard
And after mete soon and swythe
King Richard spoke with chere blythe
To the king that sat him by
Welcome be ye sykerly
Sir for love I pray the
Of thy help to wend with me
To hethenes without fail
For gods love to give battle
The king granted all in gryth
And all his realm to wend him with
And my self sir thereto
Nay quod Richard I will not so
Thou art to old to beker in fight
I pray the that thou me dyght
An hundred knights styffe to stand
Of the best in thy land
For a year that it be done
And of vytayll ready wone
And squyers that fall them to
The king granted that to do
Another thing I shall the give
That may the help while thou live
Two rich rings of gold
The stones therein ben full old
Fro hens to the land of ynde
Better shalt thou none find
For who that has that one stone
Water ne shall him drown none
That other stone who so it has
Fire ne shall him do no skathe
How the king of france betrayed king Richard.
QVod king Richard sir gramercy
His knights were all ready
Sergeauntes of arms and squyers
Stedes I charged and destrers
With arms and with other vytayle
King Richard went forth with his apparayle
Toward marcell he began ride
With his host on either side
Fouke doly and Thomas of multon
With earls dukes and many a bold baron
Rychardes master Roberte of leycester
In England was none his better
And also sir Roberte of turname
Much english people with him came
And ready they found their flete
Charged with armure drink and mete
They shypped armure man and stead
And other store folk to feed
They shypped all by the sea stronde
To wend in to the holy land
The wind was both good and kene
And drove them over in to messene
Before the gates of the gryffons
King Richard pyght his pauylyons
The king of france there he found
In pauylyons square and round
And either of them kyste other
And became sworn brother
To wend in to the holy land
To wreke Ihesu I understand
A treason thought the king of france
To do king Richard dystaunce
To king Tanker he sent a writ
That turned him to little wit
The king Richard with strength of hand
Would him have driven out of his land
Tanker king of puyle was
For this write he said alas
He sent anon his messenger
To his sone that hight Roger
That was king of Cysyle land
He should come to his hand
And sent after his barownes
Earls and lords of renownes
And when they were comen euerychone
The king said to them anon
And told how the king of france
Had him warned of a dystaunce
King Roger spoke first above
And smote peace with his glove
Mercy my fader at this time
King Richard is a pilgrim
And crossed in to the holy land
That write lies I understand
I dare for king Richard swear
That he never thought you to fere
But send to him a messengere
That he come unto you here
He will come to you full soon
And his thought he will tell you anon
The king was glad of that counsel
And sent after him without fail
On the morrow he came to him Iwys
In to the rich cite of this
And found king Tanker in his hall
Among his earls and barons all
Either great te other in fair manner
With mylde words and deboner
Than said Tanker to king Richard
Lo sir king by saint Leonarde
It is done me for to wit
Of a friend here right well writ
That thou art come with great powere
For to reave me of my lands here
Thou were fair to be a pilgrim
For to slay many a paynym
Than for to grieve a christian king
That never the mysdyde no thing
King Richard was sore asshamed
And also of his words agramd
And said Tanker thou art mystought
For to have this in thy thought
And such a rage on me to bear
That I the should with arms dear
Such a treason on me to touch
And on my flesh I bear the crouche
I ne will dwell here but a day
To morrow I will wend my way
And I pray the sir Tanker king
Procure me none evil thing
For many men weneth to grieve other
And on his heed falls the fother
For who so wayteth me despyte
Him selse shall naught pass quyte
Sir quod Tanker be not wroth for this
Lo here are the letter forsothe Iwys
That the king of france me sent
That other day in present
K^nge Richard saw and understood
The king of france would him no good
King Richard and king Tanker kyste
And were friends with the best
That might be in any land
I loved be Ihesu crystes sonde
King Richard went again well still
And suffered the frensshe kings will
He vndyde his tresore
And bought him bestes to his store
He let both salt and slene
Three thousand of oxen and kene
Swyne and sheep so many also
No man could tell tho
And of fysshe fowls and venyson
I ne can naught acccount in right reason
The king of france without wene
Lay in the cite of messene
And king Richard without the wall
Under the house of the hospytall
The english men went to shyppynge
And often hente hard knocking
The frensshe and gryffons down ryghtes
Slew there our english knights
Kynke Richard herd of that dystaunce
And playned to the king of france
And he answered he had no wards
Of the english taylardes
Chase thy gryffons if thou might
For of my men getest thou no right
Quod king Richard sith it is so
I wot well what I have to do
I shall me of them so a wreke
That all the world thereof shall speak
Crystmasse is a time full honest
King Richard it honored with great fast
All his clerks and barons
Were set in their pauylyons
And served with great plente
Of mete and drink and each deynte
Than came there a knight in great haste
Uneath he might draw his blaste
He fell on knees and thus he said
Mercy Richard for Mary maid
With the frensshe men and the gryffownes
My brother lies slain in the towns
And with him lies slain fyftene
Of thy knights good and kene
This day and yesterdaye I told arowe
That six and thyrty they had I slow
Fast lesseth your english hepe
Good sir take good keep
A wreke us sir manly
Or we shall hastily
Flee peril I understand
And turn again to england
King Richard was wroth and eger of mode
And began to stare as he were wode
The table with his foot he smote
That it went on the earth foot hot
And swore he would be awreked in haste
He would not wend for crystes fast
The high day of crystmasse
They began them arm more and less
Before went king Richard
The earl of salysbury afterward
That was called by that day
Sir Wyllyam the long spaye
The earl of leysestre the earl of herdforde
Fulll comely followed they their lord
Earls barons and squyers
Bowmen and arblasteres
With king Richard they began reke
Of frensshe and gryffons to be awreke
The folk of that cite aspyed rathe
That english men would do them skathe
They shette hastily the gate
With bars that they found therate
And swythe they ran on the wall
And shot with bow and spryngall
And called our men saunce fail
Away dogs with your tail
For all your boost and your orguyle
Men shall threste in your cuyle
Thus they mysdyde and myssayde
All that day king Richard they trayde
Our king that day for no need
In battle might no thing speed
On a night king Richard and his barons
Went to their pauylyous
Who that slepte or who that woke
That night king Richard no rest took
On the morrow he of sent his counseyllers
Of the ports the master maryners
Lordynges he said ye ben with me
Your counseyll ought for to be pryue
All we should us venge fond
With queyntyse and with strength of hand
Of frensshe and of gryffons
That have despised our nacyons
I have a castle I understand
Is made of tembre of England
With six stages full of tourelles
Well flourysshed with cornelles
Therein I and many a knight
Against the frensshe shall take the fight
That castle shall have a sorry nom
It shall hight the mate gryffon
Maryners arm your ships
And do up your manshyppes
By the water half ye them assail
And we will by land saunce fail
For come ye never to me
Till I of them a wreked be
Thereto men might here cry
Help god and saint Mary
The maryners began to hye
Both with ship and with galye
Sith ore spredde and sail also
Toward them they began go
The knights framed the tree castyll
Before the cite upon an hill
All this saw the king france
And said have ye no doutaunce
Of all these english cowardes
For they ne be but losardes
But reyse up your mangenell
And cast to their tree castle
And shote to them with arblast
The tayled dogs for to aghast
Now harken of Richard our king
How he let bear in the dawning
Terges and hardes his folk all
Right before the cite wall
His host he let at ones cry
Men might it here in the sky
Now let come the frensshe losardes
And give battle to the taylardes
ye frensshe men them armed all
And ran on fast upon the wall
And began the english for to assail
There began a strong battle
The english shot with arblast and bow
Frensshe and gryffons field and slow
The galeys came unto the cite
And had nygh won enter
And hard mined under the wall
That many gryffons began down fall
With hoked arowes and eke quarelles
Held them out of the tourelles
And brake both legs and arms
And eke their necks it was none harms
The frensshe men came to the stoure
And cast wild fire out of the toure
Wherewith I wot forsothe Iwys
They burnt and slew many english
And the english men defended them welee
With good swerdes of brown stele
And slew of them so great chepes
That there lay much folk on hepes
And at the land gate king Richard
Held his assawte like hard
And so manly he took one
He left of his men never one
He looked beside and saw houe
A knight that told him with a glove
King Richard and he him told
Tales in English stout and bold
A lord he said I aspye now right
A thing that makes mine heart light
Here he said is a gate one
That has ward right none
The folk is gone to the water toure
For to do them their socoure
And there we may without dente
Enter in now verament
Blyche thereof was king Richard
Stoutly he went thederwarde
Many a knight doughty of deed
After prycked upon their stead
King Richard entered without dread
Him followed full great ferhede
His baner upon the wall he pulte
Many a gryffon it byhulte
As greyhoundes stryken out of lose
King Ryeharde threste among the prese
Seven chains with his good sword
Our king for carfe a mydwarde
That were drawn for great doubt
Within the gates and without
Porcules and gates up he wan
And let come in every man
Men might se by street and lane
Frensshe and gryffons gave bane
And some to horse ran in haste
Doors and wyndowes barred fast
And ever men bare them up with leuours
And slew them with great vygours
All that they found against them stand
Passed thorugh dethes hand
They brake cofers and took tresours
Gold and silver and countours
Iewelles stones and spycery
All that they found in tresoury
There was none of englylshe blood
That he ne had as much good
As they would draw or bear
To ship or to pauylyons I swear
And ever cried king Richard
Slay down every frensshe cowarde
And ken them in bataylles
That ye have no tails
The king of france came pryckynge
Against Richard our king
And fell on knees down of his horse
And bad mercy for gods corpse
For the crown and for the love
Of Ihesu christ king above
And for the vyage and for the crose
He should be in gree and take lose
And he would have hand take
They should amend all the wrake
They that had him or his
Any thing done amys
King Richard had great pity
Of the king of france that sat on kene
And light down so says the book
And in his arms up him took
And said it should be peace still
And yield the twone all to his will
And bad him naught grieve him tho
Though he venged him of his fo
That had his good knights quelde
And eke on him despyte I telde
The king of france began to preche
And bad Richard be his souls leche
And the tresoure yield again than
That he had take of every man
And else he ne might in gods pay
To Iherusalem take the way
King Richard said with their tresoure
They might naught amend the dyshonoure
And that they have done me or this
And sir also thou did amys
When thou sentest to Tanker the king
To appayre me with thy lesynge
We have to Iherusalem the way sworn
Who breketh our pilgrimage he is forlorn
Or he that makes any medlaye
Between us two in this way
When abbated was that dystaunce
There came two Justices of france
Upon two stedes ride
And king Richard they ganchyde
That one was hight Margaryte
That other sir Hew Impetyte
Swythe sore they him trayde
Cleped taylarde and myssayde
King Richard held a tronchon tewe
And to them two he him drew
Margaryte he gave a dente than
Above the eye upon the pan
The skull brake with that dente
The right eye flewe out quytemente
And he fell down deed in haste
Hew of Impetyte was a gaste
And prycked away without fail
And Richard was soon at his tail
And gave him a stroke on the molde
That deed he thought be he should
Ternes and quernes he gave him there
And said sir thus thou shalt lere
To myssaye thy ouerhedlynge
Go plain now to your frensshe king
An archebysshop came full soon
He fell on knees and badde a bone
Of king Richard he had his grace
That he would leave his strife in that place
And there no more harm do
For gods love the people to
King Richard granted then
And drew to pauylyon all his men
To this day men may here speak
How the english were there awreke
All the while that they were there
They might well bye their chafere
There was none so hardy a man
That one evil word spoke began
How three of king Rychardes ships were perysshed in the sea / and how the
emperor put his men in prison
woodcut of a sea battle

King Richard in peace and rest
Fro crystmasse the high feste
Dwelled there till after the lent
And than on his way he went
In march month the king of france
Went to ship without dystaunce
When he was gone soon afterward
Came the doughty king Richard
Forth toward Acrys wend he would
With much store of silver and gold
Four ships were charged I fande
Toward Cyprys all saylande
Charged with tresour every dell
And soon a sorrowful caas there fell
A great tempest arose sondaynly
That lasted five days sykerly
It brake their maste and their ore
And their takell less and more
Anchor both sprette and rother
Ropes cords one and other
And were in point to synke a down
As they came against the lymosowne
The three ships right anon
All to brake against the stone
All to pieces they to tare
Uneath the folk saved ware
The maryners uneath it with held
That ship left in the shield
For the pryffons with sharp words
Some with axes and some with swerdes
Great slaughter of our english maked
And spoiled the quycke all naked
Syxtene hundred they brought on live
And in to prison hondredes five
And also naked syxty score
As they were of their moders bore
Of the ships brekynge they were blythe
The Justices of Cyprys ran full swythe
And drew up cofers many fold
Full of silver and of gold
Dysshes cups broches and rings
Cups of gold and rich things
No man by south ne by north
Ne could account what it was worth
And all was lorne that tresour
Wheder that would the emperor
The third day afterward
The wind came dryuynge king Richard
With all his great nauyes
And his sayiynge galyes
To a ship that stood in deep
The gentylmen therein did weep
And when they saw Richard the king
Their weeping turned all to laughing
They welcomed him with worshyppes
And told him the brekynge of their ships
And the robbery of his tresoure
And all that other byshonoure
Than waxed king Richard full wroth
And he swore a full great oath
By Ihesu christ our sauyoure
It should abye the emperor
He cleped sir Steven and Wyllyam
And also Roberte of turnam
Three gentle barons of england
Wise of speech doughty of hand
Now go and say to the emperor
That he yield again my tresoure
Or I swear by saint Denis
I will have three sith bouble of his
And yield my men out of prison
And for the deed pay raunson
Or hasteyl I him warn
I will work him a harm
Both with spear and with lance
Anon I shall take vengaunce
The messengers anon forth went
To do their lords commandment
And hendly said their message
The emperor began to rage
He grunte his tethe and fast blewe
A knyfe after sir Roberte he threw
He blente away with a lepe
And it flewe in a door a span deep
And sith he cried as vncourteys
Out taylardes of my paleys
Now go and say your tayled king
That I owe him no thing
I am full glad of his lore
I will him yield none other answore
And he shall find me to morrow
At the haven to do him sorrow
And work him as much wrake
As his men that I have take
The messengers went out full swythe
Of their ascapynge they were blythe
The emperors steward with honor
Said thus unto the emperor
Sir he said thou have unright
Thou had almoost slain a knight
That is messenger unto a king
The best under the son shynynge
Thou have thy self tresour great plente
If thou it withhelde it were great pity
For he is crossed and pilgrim
And all his men that been with him
Let him do his pilgrimage
And keep thy self trome damage
The eyes twynkled of the emperor
And smyled as an evil traytoure
His knyfe he drew out of his shethe
Therewith to do the steward scathe
And called him without fail
And said he would him accounsayle
The steward on knees him set a down
With the emperor for to rowne
And the emperor of evil trust
Carved of his nose by the gruste
And said traitor thief steward
Go plain to english taylarde
And if he come on my land
I shall him do such a shonde
Him and all his men quycke flayne
But he in haste turn again
The steward his nose hente
Iwys his vysage was I shente
Quyckely out of the castellran
Leave he ne took of no man
The messengers mercy he cried
For Maryes love in that tide
They should tell to their lord
Of the dishonor end and word
And haste you again to land
And I shall sese in to your houde
The keys of every toure
That owes that falls emperor
And I shall bring him this night
The emperors daughter bryghe
And also an hundred knights
Stout in battle strong in fyghtes
Against that falls emperor
That has done vo this dyshonoure
The messengers them hyed hard
Till they came to king Richard
They found king Richard play
At the chesse in his galaye
The earl of rychemonde with him played
And Richard wan all that he laid
The messengers told all the dishonor
That them did the emperor
And the despyte he did his steward
In the despyte of king Richard
And the steward presentynge
His byhest and his helping
Than answered king Richard
In deed lion in thought lybarde
Of your sawes I am blythe
Anon set us to land swythe
A great cry arose foot hot
Out was shot many a boat
The bow men and eke the arblasters
Armed them at all auenters
And shot quarelles and eke flone
As thycke as the hayle stone
The folk of the country began run
And were feign to void and fleune
The barons and good knights
After came anon ryghtes
With their lord king Richard
That never was found no cowarde
How king Richard gave battle to the emperor / and How ye emperor fled
away for fere that he had / and there was slain many of the emperors folk /
and after that he went straight to Acrys
woodcut of a battle

King Richard I understand
Or he went out of England
Let him make an axe for the nones
To break therewith ye sarasyns bones
The heed was wrought right well
Therein was twenty pound of stele
And when he came in to Cyprys land
The axe took in his hand
All that he hytte he all to frapped
The gryffons away fast rapped
Nevertheless many one he claued
And their vnthonkes thereby leued
And the prison when he came to
With his axe he smote right tho
Doors berres and Iren chains
And delivered his men out of pains
He let them all deliver cloth
For their despyte he was wroth
And swore by Ihesu our sauyoure
He should abye that falls emperor
All the bourgeyses of the town
King Richard let slay without raunsowne
Their tresour and their meles
He took to his own deles
Tidings came to the emperor
King Richard was in lymasour
And had his burgeyses to death I do
No wonder though him were woe
He sent anon without fail
After all his counsel
That they came to him on hye
To wreke him of his enemy
His host was come by mydnyght
And ready on the morrow for to fight
Harken now of the steward
He came at night to king Richard
And the emperors daughter him with
She grette king Richard in peace and gryth
She fell on knees and began to weep
And said king Richard god the keep
The steward said I am shente for the
Gentle lord awreke thou me
The emperors daughter bright
I the betake gentle knight
The keys also in battle here
Of every castle in his powere
An hundred knights I you behyght
Lo them here ready in all right
That shall you led and socoure
Against that falls emperor
Thou shalt be both lord and sire
Or to morrow of his empire
And sweet sir without fail
Yet the behooves my counsel
I shall the led by a coost
Pryuely upon his host
In his pauylyon ye shall him take
Than think upon the much wrake
That he has done the or this
Though ye him slay no force it is
Much thanked king Richard
Of the counseyll the steward
And swore by god our sauyoure
His nose should be bought well sour
Ten hundred stedes good and sure
King Richard let array in trappure
On eueryche lepte an english knight
Well armed in armure bright
And as the steward applyght
Ladde them by the moon light
So nygh the emperors pauylywne
Of the turmppettes he herd swone
It was before the dawynynge
The steward said to Richard the king
Let se Richard assail yerne
The pauylyon with the golden her ne
Therein lies the emperor
Awreke thou this dishonor
Than was Richard as fresshe to fight
As ever was foul to the flight
He prycked forth upon his stead
Him followed full great ferrede
His axe he held in hand I draw
Many gryffons he has I slawe
The waytes of that host that did aspye
And full loud began they for to cry
We betrayed and I nome
Horse and harneys lords all and some
In an evil time our emperor
Robbed king Richard of his tresour
For he is here among us
And sleeth down right by Ihesus
The english knights for the nones
All to hewed the gryffons bodies and bones
They smote the cords and fell down
Of many a rich pauylyowne
And ever cried squire and knight
Smite lay on slay down right
yield the tresour ayenwarde
That ye took from king Richard
ye ben worthy to have such mede
With many wounds to lie and blede
In the emperors pauylyon king Richard
Alyght so did the steward
And the emperor was fled away
Him self alone or it was day
Flowen was that falls cowarde
Narowe him sought king Richard
Long or the day began to dawe
Twenty thousand gryffons were I slawe
Of sylke sendell and syclaton
Was the emperors pauylyon
In the world never none syche
Ne by much thing so rich
King Richard wan the great worship
And bad they should be lad to ship
Such at Acrys was there none found
Pauylyons of so much mounde
Cups of gold great and small
He wan there without tale
Many cofers small and great
He found there full I bear
Two stedes found the king Richard
That one high fauell and that other lyarde
In the world was not their pere
Dromedary nor destrere
Stead rabyte ne camayle
That ran so swyfte without fail
For a thousand pound I told
Should not that one be sold
All that his men before had lore
Seven double they had therefore
Tidings to the emperor was come
That his daughter was I nome
And how that his high steward
Her had delivered to king Richard
By that he wyste well I wys
That he had done amys
Two messengers he clyped anon
And bad them to king Richard gone
And say your emperor and your king
That I him send gods gretynge
Homage by year I will him give and yield
And all my land I will of him held
So that he will for charity
In peace here after leave me
The messengers anon forth went
And said their lords commandment
King Richard answered thereto
I grant well that it be so
Go and said your emperor
That he did great dishonor
When he robbed pilgrims
That were going to the paynymes
Let him yield me my tresour every dele
If he will be my specyele
And all that say your emperor
That he amend that dishonor
That he did to his steward
In despyte of king Richard
And that he come erly to morrow
And cry me mercy with sorrow
Homage by year me to bear
And else by my crown I swear
He shall not have a foot of land
Never more but of my hand
The messengers by one accord
Told this the emperor their lord
Than the emperor was full woe
That he this did should do
To king Richard he came on the morrow
In his heart he had much sorrow
He sell on knees so says the book
King Richard by both the fete he took
And cried mercy with good intent
And he forgave him his maltalent
Fewte he did him and homage
Before all his baronage
That day they were at one accord
And in same did ete at one board
Great solace and much play
Together they were all that day
And when it drew toward the eve
The emperor took his leave
And went toward his hostell
In heart him was nothing well
He held him self a foul cowarde
That he did homage to king Richard
And thought how he him awreke might
Forth he rode anon right
To a cite that hight boffenent
He came by day verament
There he found many a great sire
The rychest men of his empire
To them playned the emperor
Of the shame and of the dishonor
That him did king Richard
Thorugh the help of his steward
Up there stood a noble barowne
Rich of castle and of town
The stewardes eme he was
That the emperor had shente his fas
Sir he said thou art mystaught
Thou art all about naught
Without encheson and Judgment
Thy good steward thou haste I shent
That should as he well couthe
Us have help and saved nouthe
Thorugh thy will malycyous
Right so thou would serve us
And I say the words bold
With such a lord keep I not hold
To fight against Richard the king
The best under the son shynynge
Ne none of all my baronage
Ne shall the never do homage
All the other said at one word
That Richard was their kind lord
And the emperor for his vylanye
Was well worthy for to abye
The emperor saw and understood
His barons would him no good
To another town he went and held him their
In his heart he had much care
That same time the high steward
Counseylled with king Richard
He said that him forthought sore
That the emperor was so forlore
They sought him in all wise
And found him in a cite of pryse
And certainly king Richard
Would no love to him ward
For he had broken his treuth
Of him had he no reuth
But let a sergeaunt him bind
His hondes soon him behind
And cast him in to a galey
And led him in to surrey
And swore by Ihesu that made moan and sterre
Against the sarasynes he should learn to werre
When all this war abated was
King Richard set that land in peace
The elre of leycestre full truly
Thorugh counseyll of his barony
He made him steward of that land
To keep his realm to his hand
Great feast they held afterward
His ships let dyght king Richard
Forth toward Acrys he would
With much store of silver and gold
With two hundred ships I find
Saylynge forward with the wind
And afterward fyfty galyes
For to ward his nauyes
And as the doughty king Richard
Came saylynge to Acrys ward
And had sailed with wind at will
Ten days fair and still
The alleuenth day they sailed in tempest
That night ne day had they no rest
And as they were in adventure
They a saw dromonde without mesure
The dromonde was so heavy of fraught
Uneath might it sail aught
He was toward the sarasynes
Charged with corn and with wynes
With wild fire and other vytayle
King Richard them saw without fail
He bad one haast trenchmere
And in a galey to wend them nere
And axe whens that they were
And what they have in chafere
Alyn quyckly and men I now
To the dromonde began row
And asked whens they were
And what they had in chafere
Aborde stood up their latemere
And answered alyn trenchemere
With the king of france we be saunce fail
From poyle we bring this vytayle
A month we have lain in the sea
Toward Acrys now wend we
Wind up sail quod alyn trenchemere
And sail we forth the wind is clear
Nay sir he said also I find
We must needs come behind
For we be so heavy I fraught
Uneath may we sail naught
Than said alyn soon anon
I ne here of you speak but one
But stand ye up all in fere
That we might mo of you here
And know your token after than
For we will not leave one man
Certes quod the latemere
With no mo spekest thou here
They were to night in great tempest
And now they lie and take their rest
Certes quod trenchemere alayne
To king Richard than will I said
That ye be all sarasynes
Charged with gold and with wynes
The sarasynes sterte up all pressed
And said fellow go do thy best
For king Richard and his galyes
We will not give two flies
The trenchemere began to row hard
Till he came to king Richard
And swore to him by saint Ihone
It were sarasynes euerychone
That said our king of great reuowne
That hight Richard cure de lyowne
Of your sawes I am blythe
Let each man arm them swythe
Stere thou thy galey trenchemere
I will assail that pantenere
With mine axe I will them assail
Of sarasynes I will not fail
Anon his axe was to him brought
His other arms forgate he naught
To him came maryners I now
King Richard bad them fast row
Now row on fast and who is faynte
In evil water mote he be draynte
They rowed fast and laid to
And song heuenhowe rombylo
The galey yede as fast
As quarelles out of arblast
And as the dromonde with the wind
A galey came saylynge behind
And smote him swythe fast
That the stern all to brast
The sarasynes were armed well
Both in Iren and in steel
And stood aborde and fought hard
Against the doughty king Richard
King Richard and his knights
Slew the sarasynes down ryghtes
And they began to wroke them woe
Always there stood up mo and mo
And rapped on them for the nones
Strong strokes for with hard stones
Out of the top castle on hye
That never was Richard his death so nigh
Than came seven galeys behind
To that dormonde fast saylynde
Tho stood aborde baron and knight
To help king Richard for to fight
A strong battle there began then
Between them and the hethen men
With swerdes speres and darts kene
Flones quarelles flewe between
As thycke without any stynte
As hayle after thunder dynte
And in the bekerynge that was so hard
In to the dromonde came king Richard
When he was therein with great haste
He dressed his back to the maste
With his axe all that he raught
Hastily the death they caught
Some he hytte on the bassyn
That they all claue to the chyn
And some to the gyrdell stead
And some the to ships bread
Some on the neck so hytte he
That they flewe in to these
For none armure withstode his axe
No more than a knyfe does the wax
The sarasynes as I you tell
Said he was the devil of hell
And over board than lepte they
And drowned them self I you sey
Syxtene hundred there were quelde
But thyrty sarasynes he at held
That they should bear wytnes
Of that battle at Acrys
King Richard found therein faunce fail
Much store and great vytayle
Many bartelles of fire gregeys
And many a thousand of bows turkeys
Hoked arowes and quarelles
He found there full many barelles
And of whete great plente
Gold and silver and each deynte
Of the tresour had he naught the mounde
That in the dormonde was found
For it was drowned in the flode
Or half vncharged was the good
Auaunced had been all crystente
Had the dormonde passed the sea
And came to Acrys from king Richard
An hundred winter there afterward
For all the christian men under the son
Ne had not Acrys ben I won
And thus king Richard wan the dormonde
Thorugh gods help and saint Edmonde
How king Richard cut a two a great chain / and how an archebysshop told
him the sorrow that they had suffer before.
woodcut of several people outside city walls

King Richard after anon right
Toward Acrys began him dyght
And as he sailed toward surrye
He was warned of a spy
How the folk of the hethen law
A great chain they had I draw
Over the haven of Acrys fers
Was fastened to two pyllers
That no ship should in win
Ne tho out that were there in
Therefore seven year and more
All christian kings lay thore
And with hongre suffer pain
For lettynge of that same chain
When king Richard herd that tydynge
For Joy his heart beg^n to spring
And swore and said in his thought
All that ne should them keep naught
Aswyfte strong galey he took
Trenchemere so says the book
And stered the galey right even
All mydwarde the haven
Were the maryners never so wroth
He made them row and sail both
The galey yede as swyfte
As any foul by the lift
And king Richard that was so good
With his axe before the ship stood
And when he came to the chain
With his axe he smote it atwayne
That all the barons verament
Said it was a noble dente
And for Joy of that deed
The cups fast about yede
With good wine pyment and clare
And sailed toward Acrys cyre
King Richard out of his galye
Let cast wild fire in to the sky
And the first greeks in to the se
All on a fire were the
His trumppettes yede in his galye
Men might it here in to the sky
Trompettes horns and shalmyse
The sea burnt all of fire greeks
Gynnes he had of wonder wise
Mangenelles of great quyentyse
Arblast bow made with gynne
The holy land therewith to win
Over all other utterly
He had a mile of great maystry
In the mids of a ship to stand
Such ne saw they never in no land
Four sails were thereto all new
Yelowe and grene read and blewe
With canuas I laid all about
Full costly within and without
And all within full of fire
Of torches made of wexe clear
Ouerthwarte and endlonge
With spryngelles of fire they did hand
Ground they neither corn ne good
But robbed as they were wood
Out of their eyes came read blood
Before the trough one there stood
That all in blood was begone
Such another was never none
And horns he had upon his head
The sarasynes of him had great dread
For the robbynge of the stones
They wend it had been men's bones
For it was within the night
They were a grysed of that sight
And said he was the devil of hell
That was come them to quell
A little before the light of the day
Clenly they were done away
King Richard after the marvel
Went quyckly to land faunce fail
The king of france against him came
And in his harneys he him name
Richard kyssed him with great honor
So did every king and emperor
All the kings of crystente
That had there long be
And long had layne in dolor
Vnderfonde Richard with honor
An archebysshop of great pryse
Did king Richard his service
And sith led him as ye may se
In to a pauylyon of preuyte
And told him there a doleful tale
Of a shrewde many and fale
Now he said king Richard I here
This syege has lasted seven year
It may not be let for thy
Much sorrow have we suffered sykerly
For he had no castle
That us of any ward fell
But a wide dyche and a deep
We made us within to keep
With barbycanes for the nones
Hye I wrought with hard stones
When the dyche was I made
Salandyn the sowdan was glade
And came on us with great route
And beset us all about
And with him markys feraunt
That lives on mahowne and termagaunt
He was a christian king some while
He has done us more shame and gyle
Than the sowdan and his host
The fader and sone and holy ghost
Grant him grace of worlds shame
Markys feraunt by his name
Our first battle sekerly
That was strong and deedly
Well fought our christian knights
And slew the sarasynes down ryghtes
Our christian had the maystry
The sarasynes fled with sorry cry
We slew many of them tho
And they of us many also
I shall tell you of what case
To many a man it fell alas
As we did sarasynes to deed
It befell a noble stead
Out raged fro a paynym
The christian fast followed him
The sarasynes saw where we came
And fled aside all than
And came against us with strong fight
And slew many a christian knight
And there we lost or we wyste
The best bodies under christ
The earl feres of England
There was never doughtyer of hand
And the emperor of almayne
And Ianyn the earl of spain
Twelve thousand of our meyne
There was slain with great pity
Thereof was the sowdan glade
On the morrow a new sawte he made
And he let take all the cors
Both of deed men and of horse
And cast them in to our well
Us to poison and to quell
Did he never a worse deed
To christian men for no need
For that poison and that brethe
Forty thousand took their death
Soon after it was not to hyde
The third case us began betyde
A ship came saylynge on the sea
Charged with whete great plente
And wild fire and armure bright
To help the sarasynes to fight
Our christian took the read saunce fail
That they would the ship assail
And so we did to our damage
The wind blewe fast with great rage
The sarasynes drew up their sail
And ouersayled us without fail
There we lost forty score
That has us grieved swythe sore
On saint James even verament
The sarasynes out of Acrys went
And pyght pauylyons great and wind
For to have begyled us that tide
Our christian men were wight
Earl baron squire and knight
Saw the sarasynes had riches
And we of all good destres
We thought to win to our pay
Of that tresour if that we may
Fyfty thousand them armed well
Both in Iron and in steel
And went forth to batayllynge
The sarasynes saw their coming
And fled aside swythe fast
And our meyne came after in haste
And began ride with great randon
Till they came to their pauylyon
They found there fellow read
Tho we wend they fled for dread
We found therein bread and wine
Gold and silver and bawdekyne
Vessel of silver ouppes of gold
More than we take would
Some stood some sat down
And ete and drank great foysowne
After mete pauylyons new
Were with swerdes all to hew
And charged horses with vytayle
As nyse men should without fail
Gold and silver they put in males
And bound them fast with gyrdelles
When each man had his charge
Home ehey went with spear and targe
The sarasynes saw their wendynge
And came after fast slyngynge
At short words a great route
Had beset us all about
Soon the male were down cast
Against the sarasynes they fought fast
There we lost thousands fyftene
Noble men hardy and kene
This grieved us right sore
For we wend all to be lore
But god almighty heaven king
He sent us soon socourynge
The doughty earl of champayne
And good knights of brytayne
And randulfe the gamyles
Johan neuell and his brother miles
And Bawdewyne a clerk full merry
The archebysshop of Caunterbury
And with them came his neuewe
A noble baron of great vertewe
Roberte gaunter of england
Against the sarasynes for to stand
And many knights of hongery
And other noble cheuallery
Than held we a great battle
But a hard case befell us without fail
At myghelmasse it must be told
The weder began to wexe cold
Tho fell both rain and hayle
And snow five foot witdout fail
Thonder lyghtnynge and weder toughe
For honger therewith our men it sloughe
For honger we lost and cold wyndes
Of our solke three score thousands
Than we our good horse slow
Soden and eten the guts towe
The flesh was deled for great deynte
Thereof had no man plente
But we ete it without bread
To pieces we carved the head
In water we boiled the blood
That us thought mete full good
A quarter of whete men us sold
For three pound of floraunce told
For forty pound men sold an axe
Though it were but little I wax
A swyne for an hundred floryne
A gose for half a mark of gold fine
And for an hen to syke things
Men gave five shelynges
And for an egg pens alleuen
And for a pere six or seven
For an appell men gave pens six
And thus our folk vnblythe wyxe
And dyed for honger and for woe
The rich men took to read tho
Aryche dole for to dyght
To barons and to many a poor knight
Twelve pens men eueryche
And six to poor that were not rich
And four to every small wight
Thus the rich the poor dyght
Therewith the more and the less
Bought them flesh of horse and ass
They might none other thing get
They thought it full good mete
I have the told king Richard here
Of our folk their lere
And the damage of Acrys host
But blessed be the holy ghost
And Mary that bare Ihesus
That thou art among us
Thorugh thy help I hope well
The sarasynes down to fell
How king Richard wan the cite of Acrys.
woodcut of knights attacking a city

King Richard wept with his eyes both
And sith said he thus forsothe
Sir bishop I beseech you pray for us
That us might send sweet Ihesus
His fone all for to dystroye
That they no more us anoye
Thus Richard took love and keped his stead
And prycked out that felowrede
He rode about the close dyche
Toward Acrys sykerlyche
Till he came co the hospytale
Of saint Johan as I tell by tale
There he let pytche his pauylyon
And let arere up his matgryffon
That was a tree castle fine
To give assawte to many a sarasyne
That he might in to Acrys seen
He had.xiii. ships full of been
When the castle was framed well
He let therein a mangenell
He commanded his men blyue
To fetch up been hyue
And bid taberrars and trompettes blow
To sawte the cite on a throw
King Richard in Acyrs cite
Let cast the hyues great plente
The wheder was hot in somer tide
The beast brake out on every side
They were agreued full of grame
And did the sarasynes much shame
For they stynged them in the vysage
That they began for to rage
And hid them in a deep sellere
For they durst not come them nere
They saw king Richard was full fell
When his flyen bytte so well
Another up Richard began set
That was cleped Robynet
A strong gynne for the nones
That cast in to Acrys great stones
The king Richard the conqueror
Cleped to him anon his mynour
And them mind in to the toure
That is cleped mawndytcoloure
He swear his oath by his crown
But it were brought down
By none the vttermest wall
He should be hewn in pieces small
The mynours mined fast
And gonners bente and stones cast
The syrasynes began to arm them all
And ran in haast unto the wall
In white shetes they began them wrythen
For bytynge of king Rychardes flyen
They said this man does us great pain
For he does both throw and main
We saw never king thus begin
It is great doubt lest he us win
King Richard stood in his matgryffowne
And saw there deeds in the town
Whederwarde the sarasynes drew
And arowes english to them slew
Out of arblastes arowes smerte
Thorugh lunge lever arm and heart
The frensshe men with great noblay
Helped to mine full well that day
The uttermost wall that day was down cast
And many sarasynes slayue at last
That day Richard so well spedde thore
That he was holden for a conquerore
For better he spedde that day or none
Than all the other in seven year had done
The sarasynes might not endoure
They fled in to that hye toure
They light torches about the wall
Men might se it over all
The torches cast great light
That betokened a new fight
That was come fro England
There thorugh they might not stand
But if Salandyn the sowdan
Came to them with men anon
Salandyn was ten mile then
And saw the torches light bren
He let gader his folk together
As thycke as snow falls in winter
They assembled upon a plain
Beside Acrys upon a mountain
Syxty thousand men I find
Cocks of heye he made them bind
To go before hastelyche
To fill the christian dyche
To rescowe Acrys they have read
And to do the christian men to deed
After came barons and knights
Strong in arms stout in fyghtes
By order they came in their manner
Of read sendell was their banere
With three gryffons depaynted well
And of asure a fair bendell
Soon after there came as many mo
Barons riding and knights also
Their gomfanon and their pensell
Was wrought of good sendell
As he faught with a lion
And in surrey with a dragon
The first were read and grene
Than came the third by dene
With syxty thousand knights
In ynde I armed to all ryghtes
After came white as any snow
Fyfty thousand on a row
There among was Salandyn
And his neuewe myrry molendyn
Their baners white without fable
With three sarasynes hedes of sable
That were shapen noble and large
Of balyn both shield and targe
No man could tell the route
They beset the christian about
The fore men cast their cothes of heye
To make the horse men ready weye
And filled the dyche full vpryght
That all the host well entered might
The sarasynes had entered nigh
But god almighty thereto sye
The cry arose thorugh the christian host
Soyes seygnyours for the holy ghost
But we have the better socoure
We be forlorn by saint sauyoure
There ye might se many a wight man
That quyckly to his armure ran
And went anon in to the dyche
And defended it hastelyche
There was many a gentle hewed
Quykly from the body take the hewed
Sheldes fell cloven a two
And many a stead stycked also
Many a knight lost his harnes
And many a stead drew their tharnes
And many a doughty man saunce fail
Was slain in that battle
But Richard our king was seek tho
All crystendome to much woe
He might not his body stere
Though his pauylyon had been in fire
Therefore the king of france made a cry
Among the christian company
That they ne should for dethes doubt
Not pass their close dyche about
But hold them all within
That the sarasynes should them not wyn
And tho that were in I come
Of sarasynes they were I nome
And hastily done to deed
For them yede no raunson to mede
While king Richard so syke lay
The reason I you tell may
For the trauayll of these
And strong air of that country
And for unkind stynke and hete
And mete and drink was not sweet
To his body that he there fond
As it was in england
King Richard his men bad seche
For some wise clerk and certain leche
Christian or else sarasyne
For to look his bryne
And eueryche said his advise
But there was none of them wise
That might his sorrow sese
Or of his pain him relese
Sorry was the folk english
For their lord lay in great anguysshe
For king Richard lay so sore syke
All about they began seek
On knees prayed the christian host
To the fader and sone and holy ghost
Night and day with good intent
That Richard might have amendment
Thorugh the bidding of our lady dear
Her blessed sone herd her prayere
Thorugh his grace and virtue
He turned out of his ague
To mete had he no savor
To wine ne water ne to no lycour
But after porke he was a longed
Though all his men should be honged
They ne might in that country
Neither for gold nor for fee
No porke find take ne get
That king Richard might ete
A noble knight was with our king
When he wist of that tydynge
That Rychardes manners were syche
To the steward he said pryuelyche
Our lord lies sore seek I wys
After porke he alonged is
And ye ne may none find to sell
No man be so hardy to tell
And if he do he may dye
Ye must as I you say
That he know not of that
Take a sarasyne young and fat
And in haste that deed be slawe
And his heed of him be fawe
And soben full hastily
With good powder and spycery
And with good saffron of good color
When king Richard feleth the savor
Out of the ague if he be went
He shall have thereto good talente
When he has thereof a taste
And eten a good repaste
And supped of the brothe a soap
And sleep thereafter and sweet a drope
Thorugh gods help and my counsel
Soon he shall be hole without fail
The sothe to say at words few
Slain and soden was that shrewe
Before Richard it was brought
Quod his folk we have porke sought
Arise and suppe of the brothe sote
Thorugh gods might it shall be bote
Before the king kerued a knight
He ete faster than he kerue might
King Richard knew the fiesshe fro ye bones
And drank right well after for the nones
And when he had eten I now
He lay still and drew in his arm
His chamberlayne covered him warm
He lay and slepte and swette a stounde
Soon he became hole and sound
When he awoke he arose
And romed about in the close
And all the folk him showed
Glad was both learned and lewed
And thanked Ihesu and Mary
That he was out of his malady
The sarasynes spedde with all their might
The dyche to win with all their might
The barbycanes they field down
And had nygh entered and in I come
When king Richard that tidings herd
As a wdde man tho he sterre ferde
And he armed him in his armor
For love of christ our savior
To fight I have great delight
With hounds that wylleth us despyte
Now I me feel hole and light
This day shall I preue my might
If I am strong as I was before
And if I can dele strokes great store
All that I mete I shall feel
Such a dose I shall them dele
That for the love of their mahon
They shall have their waryson
He was armed to all ryghtes
With him his footmen squyers and knights
And the christian all by dene
Wonder it was that host to seen
The sothe to say and not to lie
Of sarasynes were twyes so many
Before went his templers
His gascoynes and his ospytalers
Our king among the sarasynes rode
To some he gave full great lode
A king he hit above the shield
That helm and heed flow in the field
Another he has a stroke I raught
All his harneys halpe him naught
To the sadyll he clefte the ferth
All that he smote it went to earth
Blythe was the christian fela wrede
Of king Richard and of his deed
For none armure withstode his axe
No more than a knyfe does the wax
When the sowdan saw them so strong
He said the devil was them among
For down right there he slew
With all his host he him withdrewe
And fled with all his baronage
In to town men call it cage
And certes all the rerewarde
Were slain by king Richard
The sarasynes that in Acrys ware
Were anoyed and full of care
When they saw the sowdan flee
And king Richard down right slay
Thus all day till it was night
They and the christian kept fight
At even when the son was set
Every man drew to his reset
The christian both poor and rich
Went within their close dyche
To rest them for they were weary
And king Richard let make a cry
Trusty folk that might the pales keep
While that other lie and sleep
The sarasynes that were without
Of king Richard they had great doubt
For he had the pryse I won
Away they rode and swythe run
That might flee and them hyde
There they durst not abide
Of the space of ten english mile
When Richard had rested a while
A knight his harneys began unlace
Him to comfort and to solace
Him was brought a soppe in wine
The heed of the wild swyne
He said feign I would I had
For I am feeble feynt and mad
Of mine evil I am fere
Therewith serve me at my soupere
Quod the coke the heed I ne have
Than said Richard so god me save
But I se the heed of the swyne
Forsooth thou shalt soon lose thine
The coke saw none other might be
He fet the heed and let him se
He fell on knees and made a cry
Lo the heed here Richard mercy
The black vysage when Richard saw
His black berde his tethe white as snawe
He began to laugh as he were wood
What is sarasynes flesh so good
And never before I it wyste
By gods death and his vpryste
Shall we never dye for defaute
While we may in assawte
Slay sarasynes and the flesh take
Wesshe sethe them and bake
Gnawe the flesh fro the bones
Now I have assayed them ones
For honger or we be to woo
I and my folk shall ete moo
On the morrow without fail
The cite he began to assail
The sarasynes might not endoure
They fled in to the hye toure
And cried trews and plement
To king Richard that was so gent
And also to the king of france
And bad mercy without dystaunce
Anon stood up sir latemere
And cried loud with voice clear
He said here good lordynges
For I you bring good tidings
That sir Salandyn sent by me
He would that Acrys yielded be
And Iherusalem in to your hand
And surrey all the land
To flomiordan the water clear
For two thousand besauntes by year
And if ye will not so nore
Ye shall have peace for evermore
So that ye make the king of surrye
Markys feraunt of great maystrye
For he is the strongest man Iwys
Of crystendome or of hethenys
Than answered king Richard
Thou lies he said false cowarde
In every gaderynge a prese
Markys is a false traitor and a lose
He has whyted Salandynes hand
To be king of surrey land
And by the king in trynyte
That traitor shall it never be
He was christian by my faders days
And sith he has renyed his lays
And is become a sarasyne
God give him well evil pyne
He is worse than an hounde
He robbed syxty thousand pound
Out of the holy hospytallers hand
That my fader sent in to this land
That men cleped king Harry
Christian men to govern by
I bid him hye out of this host
For I swear by the holy ghost
And by Mary that bare Ihesus
Find: I that traitor among us
Other by night or by day
With horse he shall be draw I say
Than answered the king of france
To king Richard without dystaunce
O suffer sir beus amys
Thou do wrong by saint denis
That thou thretenest that markys
That never did the amys
If he have done any thing ill
He shall amend it at thy will
I am his borowe so here my glove
Receive it for my love
Nay quod Richard by god my lord
I shall never with him accord
Had never ben lost Acrys town
Ne had been thorugh his tresowne
He yield again my faders tresone
And Iherusalem with great honor
And than my wrath I him forgive
And never else while I live
The king of france was woe therefore
And he ne durst speak no more
For ever he douted dentes hard
To vnderfonge of king Richard
When the latemere herd this
That king might not be sir markys
He said here good lordynges
For I have brought you other tidings
That much more is to your will
If ye will let our people pass still
With life and lymbe hand and arm
Without dente and without harm
We shall yield you the town
And the holy cross with great renown
And syxty thousand prisoners thereto
And an hundred thousand besauntes and mo
And have ye shall also therein
Rich tresour and much wine
Helmes hawberkes syxty thousand and mo
And other riches ye may find also
Where I now and other tresore
For your host seven year and more
And if that ye will not th^s fonge
We may hold you out long
And ever to find one of our
For to slay ten of your
For we have without fable
Syxty thousand men defensable
And we beseech you for the love of god
That ye will take your bode
That ye the tresour more and less
And let us quykly away pass
Than answered king Richard
In my half I grant that forward
With that ye will us quykly in late
It shall be done they said by yate
They let him in soon anon
And king Richard took them euerychone
And to prison put them thore
young and old less and more
There might none out of Acrys town
Till paid was that raunsowne
And the holy cross therewith
Or they must have peace and gryth
There was found many hordes
That was departed among lords
Strife there was at their coming
But the best tresour had our king
The christian prisoners of Acrys town
King Richard gave clothe great foysowne
Mete and drink and arms bright
And made them full fresshe in fight
And took them to his partyse
To avenge god of his enemyse
King Richard in Acrys had nome
Of sarasynes that theder were come
That were gods enemyse
Hardy knights of great pryse
Of hethenes of great lordynges
Dukes princes sons of kings
And admyralles and many a noble man
Their names I ne tell can
In prison they lay bound fast
To the sowdan they sent in haste
And said we bear so many chains
And these men done us so many pains
We may neither sit nor lie
But ye us out of prison bye
And with raunsom help and borowe
We shall dye or the third morrow
The rich sowdan was woe therefore
Knights princes well two score
Many an admyrall and many a lord
Said we read that ye make accord
With king Richard that is strong
To deliver our children out of wrong
That they ne be hanged ne draw
Of tresour Richard will be full fawe
That our children may come home all
Charge mewles horses by your counsall
Of bright gold and of bawdkyne
For our eyres to make fine
Men say english men love gifts
Of gold well thyrty men's lyftes
Were laid on mewles and on rabyte
Thyrty earls clothed in samyte
That were well auysed of tongue
To king Richard that tresour bronge
All to Acrys they it brought
On knees of grace they besought
Our sowdan sends the this tresore
And will be thy friend ever more
For the prisoners that thou have nyme
And let them go with life and lyme
Out of thy prison thou them let
That no man slay them ne beat
For all they ben doughty vassalles
Kings sons and admyralles
The best doing at this time
That now ben in all sarasyne
And our host most strusteth to
And Salandyn loves them also
Not for a thousand pound of gold
None of them he lose would
King Richard spoke words mylde
That gold to take christ me shylde
Among you part every dele I charge
For I brought in ships and in barge
More gold and silver with me
Than your lord and such three
Of his trelour I have no need
But for my love I you bid
To mete with me that ye dwell
And afterward I shall you tell
Thorugh counseyll I shall give answer
What word ye shall to your lord bear
They granted him with good will
King Richard cleped his marysshall still
And took him to counseyll alone
I shall the tell what thou shalt done
Pryuely go unto the prysowne
Take the sarasynes of great renown
And tho that been of rychest kyn
Pryuely slay them therein
And or the hedes be of smyten
Look every name be written
Upon a score of parchemyn
Than bear the hedes to the kechyn
In to a caudron let them be cast
And bid the coke sethe them fast
And look that he the here of stryppe
Of heed and berde and of lyppe
When we be set and should ete
Look that ye not forgete
Serve them in this manner
To lie every heed in a platter
And bring them forth in your hand
The vysage upward the tethe greuonde
And look they be no thing raw
His name fastened about the brawe
What he hight and of what kyn I bore
And an hot heed bring me before
As I were well apayed withal
Fast thereof ete I shall
As it were of tender chyke
For to se how the sarasynes it like
The marysshall so says our geste
Anon did king Rychardes heste
Anon the waytes to mete blewe
The messengers no thing knew
Of Rychardes law ne of his custom
Quod he friends ye be welcome
To them he was well compenable
They were set at hye table
Salt was set but no bread
Neither wine white nor read
The sarasynes began fast stare
And thought how shall we fare
King Richard was set on the dese
With dukes earls proud in prese
Fro kechyn came the first course
With trumppettes pypes and tabours
The steward to well good yeme
To serve king Richard well to queme
Lest after mete tide any harm
A sarasynes heed anon all warm
He brought to king Richard not cleuede
The name I written on the forhede
Always an heed between two
The messengers were served tho
In the foreheed written the name
Thereof they had all grame
But when the names they seen
The teres ran out of their eyes
When they the letters radde
For to be slain they were adradde
King Richard his eyes to them drew
And saw how they changed hew
For their friends they syghed sore
That they had lost for evermore
Of their kynne and blood they were
Tho that might evil forbere
Made well sorry chere
And rewed the time that they came there
King Richard beheld them well
How that they ete no morcell
The knight that should Richard serve
With a knyfe he began the heed carue
King Richard ete with heart good
The sarasynes wend that he were wood
Eucryche sat still and plucked other
And said this is the deuylles brother
That sleeth our men and thus eteth
But king Richard not forgeteth
About him he looked yerne
With wroth semblaunt and with stern
The messengers tho he badde
For my love be you glad
And look ye be well at ease set
Why kerue ye not of your mete
And ete fast as I do
Tell me why ye loure so
The messengers sore quoke
They ne durst speak ne look
In to the earth they would have cropen
For to have been slain they hopen
They answered him never a word
Quod Richard bear fro the board
The mete that ye before them set
And other mete ye them fet
Men brought bread without boost
Venyson cranes and roost
Pyment clare and drink of the best
King Richard bad be merry his gest
There was none of them that ete list
King Richard their thought well wyste
And said friends be not squemous
This is the manner of my house
To be served first god it wot
With a sarasynes heed all hot
But your manner not I knew
As I am a king christian and true
But ye shall be in certain
All safe to wend home again
For I ne would for no thing
That word of me should spring
That I were so vylayne of manners
For to mysdo messengers
Tho they had eten and cloth fold
King Richard began them to behold
On knees they asked leave to gone
That on message theder come
I dare well say by saint John^
They had lever have been at home
With wife child and their kind
Than all the good that was in ynde
King Richard spoke to an old man
Wend home and tell thy sowdan
His malyncoly that he abbate
And also say ye come to late
To slowly was the message gessed
Or that ye came the flesh was dressed
That men should therewith serve me
Thus at none and all my meyne
And say him it shall not avail
Against us to give battle
Bread wine flesh fysshe and kunger
We will never dye for hunger
While that we may wend to fight
And slay the sarasynes down right
Wasshe the flesh sethe and brethyn
With one sarasyne I may well fedyn
Well an nine or an ten
Of my good english men
King Richard said I you wraunt
There is no flesh so nouryssaunt
To none english christian man
Partryche heron fesaunt neswan
Cow ne ox sheep ne swyne
Than is the slesshe of a sarasyne
For they ben both fat and tender
And my men lene and sclender
But while that any sarasynes be
Alive in this country
For mete will we not care
About shall we fast fare
And every day we will ete
As many as we may get
In to England will we not gone
Till they be eten euerychone
The messengers home did turn
Before the sowdan they did mourn
The elder knight told the sowdan
That king Richard was a noble man
And said lord I the warn
In the world is none so stern
On knees we told him our tale
But it us ne auayled no gale
Of our gold would he none
He swear he had better wone
Of rich tresour than have thou
To us said I give it you
Tresour gold cloth of pall
Part it among you all
To mete badde us abide
We were set at a board him beside
That stood Rychardes table nygh
But none of us before him sygh
No bread white ne sour
But salt and none other lycoure
What mese first before him came
Well I beheld the seruyse than
A knight brought fro the kechyn
An heed soden of a sarasyn
Without here in a platter broad
His name before his heed stood
Was written about his eyes
Me needs not for to lain
What heed it was my felawe did ask
It was the sowdan sone of damask
And lord as we sete in fere
We were I served in manner
Ever an heed between twaye
Forsothe than wend we to dye
There came between my fellow and me
The kings sone of rube
His of peers that sat me by
The third was of samary
The fourth was of aufryke
For sorrow tho began we syke
Our hertes tho brake nigh asonder
Lord yet may thou here mo wonder
Before king Richard a knight in haste
Carved him of the heed and he ete fast
With his tethe he grynded flesh hard
And as a wood man tho he farde
With his eyes stepe and grym
He spoke and we beheld him
He said we should go safe and quyte
For no man shall do you dyspyte
He the sends ready answer
Or that we might come there
Men of our kind were I slawe
And gyneth not though thou ware draw
And hyde thy store from his host
For he says his men make their boost
That he ne shall let one a live
In all his land child ne wyue
But slay all that he may find
Sethe the flesh and with tethe grynde
Hunger shall them none ayle
In to england will they not sail
Till they have made plain warke
His clothes of gold and his sarke
Salandyn rent tho with Ire
Kings princes and many a sire
Said alas that they were borne
For now we be all forlorn
For they were wight men and strong
Well always we live to long
Alas that we thus be begone
Now that Richard has Acrys won
He has meant if he go forth
To win eest west south and north
And ete our children and us
Lord Salandyn what redest thou us
Send to him and beseech them efte
For them that been on live left
To let them go if that he would
Give him such for he will no gold
Rich medes for the nones
Of good perles and precious stones
Charged full many a cofer
If that he will than him profer
For to forsake Ihesu and Mary
Thou white him give land a great party
To be in peace and let be war
Sith he is come so far
Thou will not that he his trauayll lose
Grant him self to come and chese
Tho lands that him lyketh best
And make him sowdan after heste
After thy self and rycheste king
Conferme it him and his of prynge
And if it be that he will so
Swythe in peace he come the to
And thou shalt forgive him thy malatent
Though he have thy folk shent
And as thy brother thou love and kyse
In war to be bold and wise
Of all the world to win the pryse
And so shall ye leave and be friends
With Joy to your lives ends
Salandyn by his sergeauntes
Sent king Richard his presauntes
And be sought him for shame
That he has to estage tame
And if he would his god forsake
And mahowne to his lord take
Of surrey he will make the king
And of egypt that rich thing
Of darres and of babyloyne
Of arres and of susoyne
Of aufryke and of vogye
Of all the lands of alyxsaundrye
Of greece and eke of tire
And of many an other empire
And make he will the sowdan anon
Of all ynde to prester Johan
King Richard answered the messengers
Fie on you foul losengers
You and Salandyn your lord
The devil you hang with a cord
Go swythe and say Salandyne
That he make to morrow a fine
For all his dogs in hostage
Or they shall dye on evil rage
And if I may have a few year
Of all the lands that ye reken here
I shall not leave half a foot
So god do my foul bote
I will not leave my lords law
Of all the lands under heaven ahawe
And but I have the rode to morrow
His men shall dye with sorrow
They answered at the form
They wyste not where it was become
Quod king Richard sith it is so
I wot well what I have to do
Your sowdan is not so slye
So queyntly to blere mine eye
He cleped his knights anon
And bad them to Acrys gone
And take of sarasynes syxty thousands
And knytte behind them their hondes
And led them out of the cite
And smite of their hedes without pity
And say I shall teache Salandyn
To pray me to live on oppolyn
They were brought out of the town
Save twenty he held at raunsowne
They were brought in to a place even
Than hard Richard an angel of heaven
That said seygnyours tues tues
Spare them naught behede all these
King Richard herd the aungelles voys^
He thanked god and the holy croyse
They were beheded hastelyche
And I cast in to a dyche
Thus king Richard wan Acrys
God grant us all his sweet blys
His doughty deeds who will here
Lysten now to me with good chere
Yet of an other battle / and how king Richard wan it / and also wan the
cite of arsour.
IT was before saint James tide
When the fowls began to chyde
King Richard went forth a pace
Toward the cite of cayface
Ever forth by the maryne
By the river of chaylyne
Salandyn that herd tell
And came pryckynge after snell
woodcut of a battle
With syxty thousand sarasynes strong
And thought to do the christian wrong
He ouertoke the rerewarde
And there began a battle hard
Hastily swerdes they drew
And many a christian they slew
Unarmed was the rerewarde
And fled in haast to king Richard
When king Richard herd this
That the sarasynes slew men of his
On fauell of sypres he sat falowe
That was swyfte as any swalowe
The kings baner was on field
The sarasynes thereon beheld
When they the baner might see
All they began for to flee
King Richard after began ride
And they turned at that tide
And smote together with great randowne
As the world should fall down
King Richard before smote
With his axe that bitter bote
He them to hewed and to carfe
Many a sarasyn under his hand starfe
And many one I tell you syker
Hente their death in that beker
Thorugh a carte of Hoberte ganter
That was set in the mire
The carter lost his hand right
There was slain many a knight
For that harneys kept men forty
And thereof was slain thyrty
For Salandynes sons theder came
And the harneys them bename
King Richard hyed him thederwarde
To rescowe his rerewarde
Yet almoost he came to late
And that was seen therate
In hand he held his axe good
Many a sarasyn he let blood
There was none armure verament
That mygh withstonde his dente
And the long spaye that tide
Faught right well on every side
That down it went all that he smot^
With his sword that bitter bote
And the battle was doutous
And to our men full peryllous
For the hete was so strong
And the dust rose them among
And have set the christian hand
That they fell deed on the sonde
Mo dyed for here at short words
Than for dente of spear and swerdes
King Richard was almoost arteynt
And in the powder well nygh adreynt
Upon his knees he began down fall
Help of Ihesu he began for to call
For love of his mother marye
And as I find in his storye
He saw come saint George the knight
Upon a stead was good and light
In arms that were white as flower
With a cross of reed color
All that he met in that stounde
Horse and man he field to ground
Anon the wind began wexe light
And stern strokes he began dyght
When king Richard saw that sight
In his heart he wexed good and light
And egerly as a lion without fail
The sarasynes he began to assail
And than braundys the lumbarde
Roberte turnam and king Richard
All tho that against them began drive
Soon they berefte them their live
The sarasynes fled to reseth
To the mount of Nazareth
They were so hyed at the spore
That much of their folk they lore
And king Richard went a pace
Unto the cite of cayface
And thanked the king of glory
Of that grace and of that vyctorye
And all they made great solace
For the winning of cayface
Now as this was a gracyous deed
Lysten now how I shall you read
Soon on the morrow he let cry
That all his host should hye
Toward the cite of palestyne
Ever forth by the maryne
Their pauylyons began they tell
And to long there did they dwell
For to abide their vytayle
That came by water saunce fail
Certes that was the worste dwelling
That ever dwelled Richard our king
Therwhyles the sowdan Salandyne
Sent after many a sarasyne
To beat down the castle
That was cleped meruell
And the castle calafyn
That was made of good engyn
Of sezary they field the wall
And toure of arsoure all
Iaffe castle they bette a down
And the good castle torowne
Castle pilgrim they field there
And the good castle laffere
The castle of saint George derayne
They bette down and made all plain
The walls they field of Iherusalem
And eke the walls of Bedlem
Maidens castle they let stand
And the castle of aukes land
By tho costs no more they let
For Richard should have no reset
And when they had thus I do
King Richard they sent unto
And said they would the next morrow
Mete him in the field with sorrow
The sowdan said he would to him ready
If he durst him abide
Under the forest of arsoure
He would assail his valor
King Richard made it not tough
Of that tidings full loud he lough
King Richard let cry in his host
In the name of the holy ghost
That they should with vygoure
Rest that night in arsoure
And dyght them all ready than
On the morrow to fight with the sowdan
On saint Maryes even the natyuyte
Thus same battle should be
There was many an hethen man
That with the Salandyn came than
Ofynde of perse of babyloyne
Of araby and of susoyne
Of aufryke and of voyge
Of all the land of alysaundre
Of great greece and of tire
Of many an other rich empire
Of mo lands than any man can tell
Save he that made both heaven and hell
That night was Richard before arsoure
Under the forest of lysoure
With him there were of England
Wight knights doughty of hand
Much frensshe folk and templers
Gascoynes and eke hospytalers
Of pronaunce a fair company
Of poyle and of lumbardy
Of gene of sysyle and of costan
There was many a doughty man
Of estryche and of almayne
That well could fight in a plain
Of christian knights that were hende
The fayres host to the worlds end
And ye shall here as it is written
How that the battle was I smyten
Salandyn came by a mountain
And ouerspradde hill and plain
Syxty thousand said the spy
Came in the first company
With long speres and hye stedes
Of gold and silver was their wedes
Fyfty thousand came afterward
Of sarasynes stout and hard
With many a pensell and sylklatowne
And of sendell bright and brown
After came five and fyfty thousonde
With Salandyn on stedes round
They came armed from foot to head
In full good harnes as I read
Three thousand turkoys came at the last
With bow turkeys and arblast
A thousand tabourers and mo
All at ones they smote tho
That all the earth quaked under
There men might se great wonder
Now speak we of Recharde our king
How he came with his gynnes to batayllynge
He was armed in spentes of stele
And sat upon his good stead fauele
Well him loved baron and knight
For he could well ordain a fight
The first battle to the templers
He gave out the hospytalers
And he bad them go out in gods name
The devil to shenshyp and to shame
Iakes denis and John^ denes
Before went in that pres
In the world there ne were
Better knights than they were
Forth they prycked full hardyly
With knights thousands twenty
And they sarasynes soon they met
With grymly lances they them grette
Many a sarasyne had their fyn
That went to their god appolyn
And tho that were slain of our
Went to Ihesu christ our savior
Iakes denis was a good knight
To slay the sarasynes he did his might
He prycked before his folk to rathe
With his two sons that was skathe
Three thousand turks come with boost
Between Iakes and his host
There might no knight come him to
For no thing that they might do
Neither he might not withdraw
For the people of the hethen law
It was scathe by Ihesu christ
That king Richard thereof not wyste
For he was yet all behind
For to ordeyne twenty thousand
Tho should the duke of burgoyne
Led and the earl of coloyne
Thus they came and did their deuere
Against the hethen pantenere
And Iakes and his sons two
Almoost were slain tho
They laid on every side right
And slew the sarasynes with might
Twenty Iakes slew and either of his sons ten
Of the crewell hethen men
Ten sith his horse was field
And ever he covered him with his shield
He had no help of his templers
Nor of none of his hospytalers
Nevertheless doughtely he faught
The sarasynes yet field him naught
Well he laid on with sword
And ever he cried Ihesu lord
I shall dye for thy love
Receive my soul to heaven above
The sarasyne laid on with their mase
And all to frusshed him in the face
Him and his two sons both
King Richard therefore was wroth
But when king Richard herd this
That deed was Iakes denis
Alas he said this is wrong
That I have bid behind so long
He smote fauell with spores of gold
Come after him who so would
A lance in his hand he held
Therewith he smote an admyrall in the shield
The dente smote thorugh the hethen heart
I understand he began to smarte
King Richard his hand withdrewe
And with his lance a king he slew
And so he did an admyrayle
And five dukes without fail
All that he raught with his lance selue
King Richard therewith slew kings twelve
The.xiii. knight unto the chynne he kerfe
The lance brake the sarasyne sterfe
His axe from the arson he drew
And many a sarasyne therewith he slew
He smote some on the shulder bone
And carved them to the sadell anon
And some he pared the crown
That they ne helped mahowne
There was no armure made with hand
That might Rychardes axe withstonde
Of my tale be not awondred
The frensshe said he slew an hundred
Whereof is made this english saw
Or he rested him any thrawe
Him followed many an english knight
That egerly helped him to fight
And laid on as they were wode
Till valeys ran all on blood
The sarasynes said in their pauylyons
That the christian fared as lions
And that Richard with their folk fares
As hende grehoundes do with hares
Upon their stedes tho they lepte
Swardes and speres to them they grepte
Many a man there slay other
And many a sarasyne his brother
And many of the hethen hounds
With their tethe gnewe the grounds
And by the blood upon the gras
Men might se where Richard was
Brain and blood he shed I now
Many an horse his guts drowe
There was many an emty sadell
It bewepte the child in the cradell
He thought to rescowe Iakes denayne
But or he came he was slain
For he and his sons anon
Were all to frusshe flesh and bone
Yet had he them to his pauylyowne
In despyte of their god mahowne
Tho fought Richard on every side
The sarasynes durst him not abide
Syxty thousand and seven score
At ones Richard drove him before
Up against an hye clyue
They fled as dear were drive
And for the dread of king Richard
Of the clefe they fell down ward
And all to brake horse and man
That never came to live ayan
That saw the sowdan Salandyne
He was syker his life to tyne
He left his pauylyon and his tent
And fled away verament
Than king Richard saw him fleande
He sewed after ^aste slyngande
To slay the sowdan he had thought
And for he might overtake him naught
And of a foteman a bow he took
And drew it up to the hoke
And shot it to the sowdan anon
And smote him thorugh the shulder bone
Thus the sowdan with doloure
Fled from the battle of arsure
Syxty thousand there were slawe
Sarasynes of the hethen law
And of christian but ten score
Blessed be Ihesu christ therefore
King Richard took his pauylyons
Of sendell and of sylke latons
They were shapen with caruelles
Of gold and silver were their penselle^
Many was the noble Ieste
Was thereon painted of wild best
Tygres dragons lions and lybarde
And this won good king Richard
Bound in cofers and great males
He gate therewith out tales
Florynes besauntes and white torneys
Sylke samyte and eke sarsyneys
Of tresour they had so much won
That they ne wyste where it to done
King Richard with great honor
Went to the cite of arsoure
And rested him there all night
And thank Ihesu crystes might
On the morrow king Richard arose
His deeds were rich and his lose
Of naples he cleped sir ganter
That was his master hospytaler
And bad him take with him knights
Stout in arms strong in fyghtes
And go ye the flede to
There the battle had been do
And led Iakes the barowne
In to Iherusalem town
And bury him in the earth rychely
For he was a man full worthy
Anon it was done without cheste
Hastily king Rychardes heste
And thus king Richard wan arsour
God give his soul great honor
Fro thens he went right sone
Toward the cite of babylone
How king Richard asseyged the cite of babyloyne and how he wan it / and of
two deuylles / that one in lykenes of mare / and that other in lykenes of a
colte / whereof ye sowd an sent the colte to king Richard.
woodcut of a knight dying in battle

THe chief sowdan of hethenys
To babyloyne he was flowen Iwys
After his counseyll he sent that time
That theder came many a paynym
An hundred thousand that day was telde
Of spores of gold in the field
Without all that other putayle
That theder came without fail
For so he said that was the spy
That told folk on both party
Four hundred thousand of hethen men
To battle had the sowden
Now harken and it be your will
The words that I shall say you till
There men loves troth and right
Ever god sends strength and might
That was there full well seen
Of our christian men I wene
There was no mo in book I found
In all but four score thousand
King Richard.xxx. thousand ladde
For Phelyp of france and his men were badd
Fyfty thousand led he
By the one side of that cite
To keep with the sarasynes stout
Was none so bold that durst come out
For Richard on that other side lay
On battle ready every day
With spryngelles and with mangenelles
With many arowes and quarelles
Fast they slange hard stones
Bekerynge with them for the nones
There was no sarasyne so stout
That ones the wall durst look out
The cite was so strong within
That no man might to them win The strong gynnes for the nones
To break the walls with the stones
Their gates and their barbycan
And be ye sure many a hethen man
Made them counter hard and strong
And many a man was slain among
Of the christian was many slain
But on the frensshe fell the most pain
For had king Phylyp true be
All the syege of that cite
The^e ne had escaped no man
He^hen king ne sowdan
That ne had be slain down right
For Richard ever upon the night
When they were gone to their rest
With his men he was full priest
And gave them battle full smarte
That no man might have starte
And slew them down great plente
And wild fire they cast in to the cite
The sarasynes defended them fast
With bow turkeys and with arblaste
Full hard fight was them between
So they said that did it seen
Quarelles and arowes so thycke did fly
As does the rain that falls fro the sky
And the wild fire the folk began bren
A counseyll took the hethen men
To fight with them upon the field
They would not the cite yield
Up stood their latemere on the wall
And cried unto the folk all
And asked trues of Richard there
But he would not grant in no manner
And with him might he not speed
To take trues for no need
Nay certes said Richard than
Till I have slain the sowdan
And all that been in that cite
The latemere tho turned his eye
To that other side of the town
And cried trues with great sown
To the rich king of france
And he granted with myschaunce
For a porcyon of gold
And else had the cite be yolde
And the sarasynes all I slain
But the sowdan was full feign
And all his folk on Richard fill
For that other side was all still
Richard wend Phylyp had fought
And he and his men did naught
But made merry all that night
And were traitors in that fight
For he loved no crowns to crake
But to do treason and tresour take
The king of france to Richard send
That they might them no longer defend
For hunger of him and his men also
He must break syege and away go
Full wroth was king Richard than
And said to that cursed false man
For couetyse and for tresoure
He does him self dyshonoure
That he shall sarasynes respyte give
It is harm that such men live
He brake syege and did withdraw
Of tresour and riches he was fawe
Great Joy the sarasynes made among
With claryons trumpettes and merry song
The next day after than
Messengers came fro the sowdan
And grette king Richard in this manner
And said if thy will it were
My lord the sowdan to the sent
If thou will grant in present
Thou art strong of flesh and bones
And he is doughty for the nones
Thou do him great harm he says
And dystroyest all his countrayes
And sleest his men and etest among
All that thou do is wrong
And thou crauest heritage in this land
But he does the to understand
That thou thereto haste no right
Thou fayest thy god is full of might
Will thou grant with spear and shield
To detreyue the right in the field
With helm hauberke and brondes bright
On strong stedes good and light
Whether ben of more power
Thy god almighty or Iupyter
And he me sent to say this
If thou will have an horse of his
In all the lands that thou have gone
Such ne saw thou never none
Fauell of sypres ne lyarde of prys
Ben not at need as he is
And if thou wylet this same day
He shall be brought the to assaye
Richard answered thou say well
Such an horse by saint Myghell
I would have to ride upon
For mine ben weary and forgon
And I shall for my lords love
That sytteth on hye in heaven above
And his own horse be good
With a spear to shede his blood
If that he will I grant and hold
In that manner that thou have told
As I must to god my soul yield
I shall mete him in the field
Bydde him send that horse to me
And I shall assaye what he be
If he be trusty without fail
I keep none other to me in battle
The messengers tho home went
And told the sowdan in present
That Richard in ye field would come him to
The rich sowdan badde to come him unto
A noble clerk that could well conioure
That was a master nygromansoure
He commanded as I you tell
Thorugh the fendes might of hell
Two strong fendes of the air
In lykenes of two stedes fair
Both like of hew and here
As men said that there were
No man saw never none syche
That one was a mare I lyche
That other a colte a noble stead
Where that he were in any mede
Were the knight never so bold
When the mare nigh would
That should him hold against his will
But soon he would go her till
And knele down and souke his dame
Therwhyle the sowdan with shame
Should king Richard quell
All this an angel began him tell
That to him came about mydnyght
Awake he said gods knights
My lord does the to understand
That the shall come on horse to land
Fair it is of body I pyght
To betraye the if the sowdan might
On him to ride have thou no dread
For he the help shall at need
Purney the a tree great and strong
Though it be forty foot long
And trusse it ouerthwarte his mane
All that he meteth shall have their bane
With that tree he shall down fell
It is a fend as I the tell
Ride on him in gods name
For he may do the no shame
Take a brydell said the angel
And make it fast on his mussell
And be the brydell in his mouth
Ride eest weste north and south
He shall the serve at thy will
When the sowdan shall ride the till
Take here a spear heed of stele
He has none armure wrought so well
But it be perysshed be thou bold
When the angel had thus I told
In to heaven again he went
On the morrow the horse was to him sent
King Richard of that horse was blythe
He let him dyght a sadell swythe
Both his arsones were of Iren
Because they should well duren
With a chain together fast
The brydell upon the heed he cast
As the angel had him taught
Two good hokes forgate he naught
In his arson he set before
With wax he stopped his eres thore
And said by the apostelles twelve
Though thou be the devil him selue
Thou shalt me help at this need
Now he that on the rode began blede
And suffered grymly wounds five
And sith he rose from death to live
And after went to hell
And the fendes might began fell
And afterward styed in to heaven
God for his names seven
One god in persons three
In his name I conjure the
That thou me serve at my will
He shoke his heed and stood still
King Richard made him ready that night
On the morrow when it was light
Seven sowdans with great route
Of that cite were sent out
And bataylled them in their array
Of great meruayll I will you say
That day was told without lesynge
Of sowdans and of high kings
There were forty and mo
The leest brought with him tho
Twenty thousand and ten
Against our good christian men
And ever was twelve of them
Against one of our christian men
Well twelve mile a coost
Lay the sarasynes host
The ground might uneath be seen
For bright armure and speres kene
They made sheltron and battle abide
Messengers between did ride
To king Phelyp and king Richard
If they would hold forward
That they made the day before
The sarasynes ben ready less and more
Four hundred thousand there been
King Richard began look and seen
Like as snow lies on the mountains
So were full filled hills and playnes
With hawberkes bright and harneys clear
Of trumpettes and of tabourere
To here the noise it was great wonder
As the world above and under
Should have fallen so fared the sown
Our christian host made them bowne
King Richard nothing them a dradde
To his folk horse and harnes he gradde
He said felawes for the rood
Look ye be of comfort good
For we get the price this day
Of hethenes all the noblaye
For evermore we have won
But he that made moan and son
Bur help and give us might
Behold how that I shall fight
With sword spear and axe of stele
But I this day mete him well
Ever more fro hens forward
Hold me for a feynt cowarde
But every christian man and page
Have to night to his wage
An heed of a black sarasyne
Thorugh gods help and mine
Such work I will among them make
Of tho that I may overtake
That fro this time to domes day
They shall speak of my pay
Every christian man was armed well
Both in Iren and eke in steel
The king of france with his battle
Was ready the sarasynes to assayll
And above the sarasynes they rode
Sheltrons pyght and battle abode
And for stopped the land weyes
That they might not flee the countries
Neither no socoure to them come
But they were slain or nome
The frensshe men did boost make
To slay sarasynes and crowns crake
But in Iestes as it is told
There was none of them so bold
To nygh the sarasynes sheltrone
Till king Richard was I come
Now comes Richard with his host
And c^^^ed them by an other coost
Between them and the cite
That none of them might flee
But they would to the river gone
Or else the christian should them slone
Than had Richard hoostes three
That one gave assaute to the cite
The second with him he ladde
To bring his horse he badde
That the sowdan had him sent
He said with his own present
I shall him mete long or night
He lepte on horse when it was light
Or he in his sadell did lepe
Of many things he took keep
He lacked naught that he ne had
His men brought him that he bad
A square tree of forty fete
Before his sadell anon he it sete
Fast that they should it brase
That it failed for no case
And so they did with hokes of Iren
And good rings that would duren
Other fastenynge none there was
But Iren chains for all that cas
And they were wrought full well
Both his gyrthes and his ptytrell
And a queyntyse of the kings own
Upon his horse was thrown
Before his arson an axe of stele
And on that other side a maswele
Himself was rychely begone
From the creste right to the tone
He was covered wondersly well
All with splentes of good stele
And there above an hauberke
A shafte he had of trusty work
Upon his shulder a shield of stele
With three lyardes depaynted well
And helm he had of rich entayle
Trusty and true was his ventayle
Upon his creste a dove white
Sygnyfyaunce of the holy spyryte
Upon a cross the dove stood
Of gold I wrought rich and good
God him self Mary and John^
As he was done the rode upon
In sygnyfyaunce for whom he faught
The spear heed forgate he naught
Upon his shafte he would it have
Gods name thereon was grave
Now harken what oath he swear
Or they to the battle went their
If it were so that Richard might
Slay the sowdan in field with fight
At our will euerychone
He and his should gone
In to the cite of babyloyne
And the king of masydoyne
He should have under his hand
And if the sowdan of that land
Might slay Richard in the field
With sword or spear under shield
That christian men should go
Out of that land for ever mo
And the sarasynes their will in would
Quod king Richard thereto I hold
Thereto my glove as I am knight
They be armed and ready dyght
King Richard to his sadell did lepe
Certes who that would take keep
To se that sight it were fair
Their stedes ran with great air
Also hard as they might dyre
After their fete sprange out fire
Tabours and trumpettes began blow
There men might se in a throw
How king Richard that noble man
Encountered with the sowdan
The chief was told of damas
His trust upon his mare was
And therefore as the book us tells
His crouper henge full of belles
And his peytrell and his arsowne
Three mile men might here the sown
His mare nyghed his belles did ring
For great pride without lesynge
Afaucon broad in hand he bare
For he thought he would their
Have slain Richard with treasowne
When his colte should knele down
As a colte should souke his dame
And he was ware of that shame
His eres with wexe were stopped fast
Therefore Richard was not agaste
He stroke the fend that under him went
And gave the sowdan his death with a dente
In his shield verament
Was painted a serpent
With the spear that Richard held
He bare him thorugh under his shield
None of his armure might him last
Brydell and peytrell all to braste
His gyrthes and his steropes also
His mare to ground went tho
Maugre her heed he made her seche
The ground without more speech
His fete toward the fyrmament
Behind him the spear out went
There he fell deed on the grene
Richard smote the fend with spores kene
And in the name of the holy ghost
He dryueth in to the hethen host
And as soon as he was come
Asonder he brake the sheltrone
And all that ever before him stood
Horse and man to the ground yode
Twenty foot on either side
All that he ouertoke that tide
On live was there left none
Thorugh out he made his horse gone
As bees swarm out of hyues
The christian men him after dryues
And cried than slay down right
Both sowdans kings and knight
When the king of france wyste and his men
That the maystry had the christian
They wexed bold and good heart took
Stedes bestrode and shaftes shoke
The king of france with a spear
An hethen king began down bear
And other earls and barownes
Noble men of great renownes
Slew the sarasynes down right
Of england many a noble knight
Wrought full well that day
Of salysbury the long spaye
To ground he field with his bronde
And tho that he before fond
Next king Richard ever he was
And of multon sir Thomas
Fouke doly Roberte of leycester
In the world was not their better
Where that any of them come
They spared another swayne ne grome
That they ne field all a down
The sarasynes sledde in to the town
For great sorrow that they seen
The teres ran out of their eyes
And swythe mercy they cryde
And soon they opened the gates wide
And let them in at their will come
The christian than the cite nome
Anon hastily therwithall
They set baners on the wall
The kings arms of england
When Salandyn began to understand
That the cite yielded was
He began to cry and said alas
The pryse of hethenes is I done
And tho began to flee full soon
With him many a baron and knight
But king Richard that was wight
When he saw the sowdan fly
Abide cowarde he said on hye
And I shall the preue false
And thy cursed gods alse
King Richard dryued after him fast
The sowdan was sore agaste
A great wood before him he saw
Theder in a great haste he flawe
Richard went the wood nere
He douted of encombrere
He might not in for his tree
Sone he turned his horse eye
With that he met a hethen king
His axe he drew out of his ring
And he hytte him on the creste
That his life no longer last
Another he raught upon the shield
The heed flewe in to the field
Six he slew of bethen kings
To tell the sothe in all things
In his geste as I find
More than twenty thousynde
Of emty stedes about yode
Up to the foot lakes in blood
All a straye about they yede
What man would might ride
That battle lasted till it was night
But when they had slain down right
The sarasynes that they might take
Great Joy the christian did make
They kneled and thanked god in heaven
And worshypped his names seven
On both sides were folks Islawe
But the nombre of the hethen law
That lay deed upon the field
To god they began their souls yield
There were slain hondredes three
And of the sarasynes more plente
An hundred thousand and yet mo
Lo such grace god sent tho
The christian in to the cite gone
Of gold and silver and precious stone
They found Inowe without fail
Mete and drink and other vytayle
On the morrow when the king arose
His deeds were rich and his lose
The sarasynes before him come
And asked him crystendome
There were crysted as I find
More than twenty thousynde
Chyrches he let make of crystes law
And their maumettes all to draw
And tho that would not christian become
They were slain all and some
And departed that tresour
Among christian with honor
Earl baron knight and knave
Had as much as they would have
When this was done I you say
He let his colte vanysshee away
How king Richard and the king of france were wroth together / and how ye
king of frau^ went home to his land.
THere they dwelled fourtenyght
And afterward they them night
Toward Iherusalem they began ride
King Phelyp spoke a word of pry^e
Iherusalem that fair cite
That is so fair and so fre
Though thou it win it shall be mine
By god said Richard and by saint martyn
And as god do my so^ue bore
Of my winning not half a foot
I ne shall give the no land
I do the well to understand
If thou will it have he said then
Go now forth and win it with thy men
Mine offrynge quod Richard lo it he^^
I will come Iherusalem no nere
And in an arblaste of vyse he ben^^
A floryn toward the cite he sense
And that was sygnyfyaunce
Ihesu christ to honouraunce
For wrath became seek the king of france
His leches he sent after without dystaunce
And they said never he should hole ben
But he in to france returned again
Than his counseyll understood
And said it was true and good
Their ships they dyght more and las^^
And went home at alhalowmasse
King Richard began to him cry
And said he did great vylanye
To wend home for maladly
Out of the land of Surry
Till done was gods seruyse
For life or death in any wise
The king of france none other would do
But in that manner departed so
And after that departing forsooth
Ever after they were wroth
How king Richard and his men made the walls of a cite which hight chalens
/ and how the duke of astryche departed from him / because of ye rebuke he
gave him because he would not do as he did / and how king Richard wan the
castle of daron.
NOw harken of Richard the king
How he wrought with his gynge
King Richard went his host
To Iaffe without any boost
The kings pauylyon good and fine
They began dyght with a gryffyne
Other lords began about sprede
Their pauylyons in fair mede
King Richard with his men all
Of the cite let make the wall
That never was no sarasynes
So strong wrought with byches
That castle was strong and rich
In the world was none him lyche
Theder might come by the sea
Of all manner goods great plente
He set every ward with good knights
Stout in arms strong in fyghtes
Men might wend the cite about
Many mile without doubt
King Richard dewelled with honor
Till Iaffe were made and the toure
From thens to chalens he went
And found the walls all to rent
Great and fair was the cite
King Ryeharde thereof had pity
King Richard besought the lords all
Of that cite to help to make the wall
And all the lords euerychone
Granted him his asking anon
Save the duke of esteryche
King Richard thought to be quycke
King Richard began to travail
About the walls without fail
So there did many an other
Fader and sone eme and brother
Made moter and laid stone
With their might euerychone
Every king and every emperor
Stones bare and mortour
Save the duke that was full of pride
He ne would them help at no tide
Upon a day king Rytharde him met
And hendly king Richard him grette
He badde the duke of his courtesye
To make of the wall his party
And he answered in his manner
My fader was another mason nor carpenter
And though your wall all to shake
I shall them never help to make
King Richard was in great error
Wrath made him to change color
The duke with his foot he smote
Against the breast god it wot
That on a stone he ouerthrewe
It was mysdome by saint Mathewe
Fie on the deuylles thou foul cowarde
In hell be thou hanged hard
Go quyckely out of this host
The curse have thou of the holy ghost
By the sides of christ Ihesus
Find I the traitor among us
Over this same days three
My self shall thy bane be
Traitor we travail day and night
In ware and wrake and in fight
And thou lie as foul gloton
And slepest in thy pauylyon
Thou drynkest wine good and strong
And slepest all the day long
I shall take from the thy baner
And cast it in to the river
Home went the duke full wroth
His own strife was him loathe
Of that despyte he was vnblythe
He trussed his harneys as swythe
And swear by Ihesu in trynyte
If he might ever his tymese
He should of Richard him so awreke
That all the world thereof shall speak
He held him all to well forward
In hell be he hanged hard
Thorugh his treason and his treachery
And thorugh the waiting of a spy
He did king Richard great shame
That turned all england to grame
A little longer and he most
And had his life by the holy ghost
Of every duke king and emperous
He had been lord and conqueror
All christian and eke panym
Sold all hold of him
The duke of estryche hyed fast
Away with his meyne in haste
And with him the duke of burgoyne
The folk of france and the earl of coloyne
King Richard let break his baner
And cast it in to the river
And cried on him with voice stepe
Home shrewed cowarde and go sleep
Come no more in no wise
Never efte in gods seruyse
The duke of estryche prycked then
For wrath his heart began bren
King Richard left with his english
Tuscanes gascoynes lumbardes Iwas
Skottes Irysshe and folk of brytayne
Geneuoys baskes and men of spain
And made the walls day and night
Till they were strong pyght
Than king Richard with great pyne
Had made the walls of chalyne
All his host with him he taas
And went forth a great paas
The first night in the name of Marye
He lay at a town that hight famelye
On the morrow he let him arm well
Both in Iren and eke in steel
By the maryne forth he went
To abbare a cite full gente
That was a castle of sarasynes
Full of stones and of riches
Both of fat flesh and of lene
Whete otes pesyn and been
King Richard it wan and soiourned there
Nine days all planere
And sent spies by each ways
For to aspye the countrayes
Of castle daron king Richard herd
All together how it ferde
For it was full of sarasynes
That were gods enemies
King Richard went theder in haste
The sarasynes for to agaste
So he went on his Iournaye
He came theder by saint James day
They besyeged the daron
To win the castle and the town
The castle was made of such stone
That it dredde assaute right none
About the walls was I dyght
They ne had never seen no sight
The sarasynes cried in their langage
Christian hounds of evil rage
Here ye have fet your dome
But ye the sooner turn home
When king Richard herd that cry
He swear his oath by saint Marye
The sarasynes should be hanged all
Or such a case should befall
The christian assailed and they defended
And many a quarrel they sended
All that day and all that night
They and the christian kept fight
King Richard saw he might not speed
Than he bethought him of an other read
King Richard took all his english
And did repe russhes in a marysshe
To fill withal the dyche of darowne
To win the castle and the town
Twenty great gynnes for the nones
King Richard sent after to cast stones
By water they were brought anon
The matgryffon was that one
That was set upon an hill
To break the walls of the castyll
That other gynne hight robynet
That on an other side was set
Richard fet an other mangenell
That cast toward an other tourell
King Richard did bind the russhes fast
And in to the dyche did them cast
And all plain the dyche made
The sarasynes no ward they hade
Wild fire thereon they cast
The russhes were on fire in haste
And brenned right to the ground
Soon within a little stounde
Of the christian many an hundred
Thereof gretely were awondred
The mangenelles threw always
And brake the walls night and day
The robynet and the matgryffowne
And that they hytte they cast down
So within a little stounde
The next wall was cast to ground
And filled full the great dyche
Efte with russhes hastelyche
Tho might our knights well
Enter in to daron castle
The earl of leycester sir Roberth
The trustyest body of myddell earth
He was the first without fail
The castle daron to assail
Up he left his banere
And smote on the destrere
The sarasynes with mysauentoure
Fled in to the high toure
That was both strong and stark
All of the sarasynes warke
And many stood without
And fought fast without doubt
Against the earl sir Robarde
They gave many a dente hard
Many a helm there was weued
And many a bassenet all to cleued
Sheldes cloven fill a two
And many a stead stycked also
Roberte turnam with his faucowne
Began there to crack many a crown
The long spaye the earl of rychemonde
Slew many an hethen hounde
All that their swerdes araught
It fell at the first draught
There dyed many christian men
But of hethen such ten
Among them came king Richard
To fight well he nothing sparde
Many one in a little stounde
With his axe he laid to ground
All on foot he began to fight
The sarasynes of him had a sight
How plenteuous was his payment
None ne might withstonde his dent
They went quykly without fable
And slew their stedes in the stable
The fairest horse and stead
That ever bare knight at need
Flesh whete flower and larder
All together they set on fire
They had lever to do so
Than with their vytayll to help their fo
By the brethe king Richard aspyde
He slew down right on every side
All that he might overtake
None amends must they make
He began to assail the hye toure
With wight men of great valor
The sarasynes in the toure on hye
Saying their ending day was nigh
Wild fire soon in haste
Among the christian it was cast
The wild fire flow about so smarte
That many a christian man it heart
They might no longer suffer that thrawe
Anon they began them to withdraw
A mile from daron castle
They cast abroad many a fire barell
And soon after in a little space
Thorugh the help of gods grace
The castle fell on fire all
Fro the toure to the uttermost wall
The houses burnt and the burdys
Gr^te smoke there arose Iwys
The sarasynes were almoost attaynt
And in the smoke well nygh adraynt
Ten hundred there cried at one word
Mercy king Richard good lord
Let us go out of this toure
And thou shalt have a great tresoure
With life and lymbe let us go
A thousand we give the to
Nay quod Richard by Ihesu christ
By his death and by his vpryste
Ye shall never down come
Till paid be that ransom
And yet thereafter be at my will
Whether I will you save or spyll
Or ye shall right there sterue
Alorde they said we shall the serve
At thy will we will us do
With that we must come the to
To honge or draw brenne or sle
Our fredome lord is in the
King Richard granted them than
And commanded the christian man
That the sarasynes be kept with sorrow
For to the son arise on the morrow
It was done as I in book find
King Richard let them fast bind
Upon a plain before the wall
King Richard let them led all
And he that paid a thousand pound
For his heed he might pass sound
He that would so much give
To a certain day he let him live
And he that paid no raunsowne
As quycke his heed was smyten down
Thus king Richard wan daron
God give us all his benyson
And his soul rest and to
And ours when it comes thereto
How king Richard smote down an image of marble / and how he slew five
sarasynes that were within ye said image and of many other matters.
AFter the winning of darowne
The king went to an other town
To gatrys with a fair meyne
For to besyege that cite
Now harken how he it wan
And ye shall here of a doughty man
A stout warryour and a queynte
That never was found in heart feynte
He that was lord of Catrys
Had been a man of prys
And fell to fight against his fo
That same time it was not so
For he was so fallen in elde
That he might none arms welde
Bus as he did after queyntyse
Harken now in which wise
Amyddes the town upon a stage
He let make a marble image
I crowned stoutly as a king
And badde his folk old and yinge
That they should never ben a know
To christian men high ne low
That they had no lordynge of dygnyte
But that image in that cite
King Richard the warryour kene
There assaute he began by dene
Spryngelles and mangenelles he bente
And stones to the cite sent
The sarasynes mercy cryde
They would cast pv the gates wide
If it were king Rychardes will
That he would not the people spyll
And he granted without les
They had enter all in peace
King Richard asked at the first word
Of the cite where was the lord
They answered Richard the king
That they ne had no lordynge
But the image of marble fine
And mahowne and their god appolyne
King Richard stood so says the book
And on the image he began for to look
How hewge he was wrought and stern
And said to them all yerne
O sarasynes without fail
Of your lord I have marvel
If I may thorugh help of my lord god
That bought us all with his blood
With a shafte smite his neck asonder
And ye shall se that wonder
Will ye believe all upon my lord
Ye than they said all at one word
Than king Richard let him dyght a shafte
Of a trusty tree and of kind craft
And for it should ben strong and last
He let bind thereto well fast
Endlonge four yerdes of ire
And sith Richard the great sire
Let set thereon a crownall kene
When it was ready on to seen
Fauell of Cypres was forth fet
And in the sadell he him set
And rode his course to the stage
And in the face smote the image
The heed tho flow the body asonder
And slew five sarasynes there under
The sarasynes said than
He was a devil and no man
And all became christian thore
young and old less and more
And hastily without lesynge
Their old lord they began forth bring
And told all his compasement
King Richard lough with good intent
And gave him the cite to welde
Though he leued adamas held
To chalyns he went again
Forth by the maryne soth to said
There he soiourned seven night
With many a doughty knight
They pyght pauylyons fair and well
For to besyege a strong castle
That was a mile beside lyem
Three mile from castle pylgrem
With thycke walls and tourelles of pride
The castle was cleped lefryde
The sarasynes saw the king was come
For dread they wend to ben I nome
Their hertes were full of woe
All by night away they flo
The gate they vnshette full yerne
And flow away by a posterne
For all this myddell earth
They ne durst abide king Richard
This noble castle verament
King Richard wan without dent
Fro thens he went to gebolyn
That hospytalers had dwelled therein
And templers both in fere
And kept the cite many a year
When Bawdewyn was slain with bronde
Salandyn took the town in hand
In that cite was saint Anne I bore
That our lady was of I bore
They pyght the kings pauylyownes
With force within the towns
And slew the sarasynes all and same
That would not leave on crystes name
There came the first wicked tydynge
To cure delyon Richard our king
Of england his brother John^
That was the fendes flesh and bone
Thorugh help of the barons sone
The chaunceler had I nome
And would be with maystry of hand
Crowned king of england
At estertyde there afterward
Than answered king Richard
What devil he said how is this
Tells John^ no more prys
He weneth that I live to long
Therefore he will do me wrong
And if he knew I were on live
He would not with me strive
I shall me so of him awreke
That all the world thereof shall speak
If John^ him crown that ester tide
Where will he me than abide
There is no king in crystente
Certes that shall his waraunt be
I ne may believe for no need
That my brother will do this deed
Yes certes said the messengere
He will so do by saint rychere
King Richard all this tydynge
Held in heart but lesynge
Fro gebolyne forth he went
To betanye a castle gente
And slew their many an hethen man
And that noble cite he wan
There come other messengers
That told Richard stout and fyers
That John^ his brother would bear
Crown at ester he began to swear
The king was loathe to withdraw his hand
Till he had I won the holy land
And slew the sowdan with dente of sword
And avenged Ihesu our lord
And he bethought him after then
He would leave there his men
And with a preuy meyne
In to england would he
And apease that war anon
Between him and his brother John^
And came again in hyenge
For to fulfill his beginning
And also he thought in his heart
A stout sarasyne began in sterte
That ought king Richard raunson
For the winning of daron
He spoke to Richard apartylyche
Among his people that were rich
Sir king thou shalt me quyte skere
And all thyn other hostagere
Thorugh thy queyntyse and thy gyn
I shall the do great tresour wyn
More than an hundred thousand pound
Florence of gold hole and sound
Of the sarasynes tresore
And much more other store
Thereto I lay to hostage my life
And my children and my wife
But I do the win that pray
On an evil death must I day
King Richard said thou mystruaunt
So as thou byleuest on termagaunt
Tell me now what folk there is
I believe it is full fayntyse Iwys
That ledeth so tresour without iayles
Sir there ben five hundred camayles
And five thousand there ben and mo
Asses and great mules also
That ledeth gold to Salandyn
Of great tresour and of fine
Of whete and of spycerye
Of sylke and sendell great plentye
Richard said so god me deem
Is there much folk that to yeme
Ye sir he said there ben before
Knights riding syxty score
And after comes such ten
Of doughty hethen men
I herd them speak in their rounynge
They were aferde of the english king
King Richard said that they should find
Though there were twenty thousynde
I would them mete euerychone
Though I were my self alone
Without help of any man
I would them flee or quycke tan
Do say me anon right
Where shall I find them to night
Here beside miles ten
Thou might find the hethen men
There they will rest and abide
Till more folk comeryde
Horse and harneys he cried anon
Cure delyon now is time to gone
Before went his templers
His gascoyens and his hospytalers
Horse and men were cried in hyenge
And went forth with Richard our king
Than said the long spaye unto the king
Sir make here thy dwelling
They ben lodged in the town
I will go and aspye their rowne
And brewe them a drink with woe
Now I will to them go
And tell them that king Richard
Is fast in to englondewarde
They will me leave with the best
And they will than go to their rest
And than sir may ye wend
And take them all slepende
Fie a devil said the king
God give the evil ending
I am no traitor take good keep
To sle men when they sleep
By clear day upon the feldes
Thou shalt se speres and sheldes
Be it earls barons or kings
All they shall have their endynges
The sarasyne our king Richard answers
There is no man in the myddell earth
Duke baron ne knight
Is none so hardy ne so wight
Ne none so much of renown
Well may you be hight Richard cure delyon
Therefore I will not it forhele
There ben of sarasynes twyes so feel
As thou have folk in this country
Sertaynly I warn the
Richard said god give me shame
Therefore and my heart be lame
For one of my christian men
Is worth of sarasynes nine or ten
The more there ben the more shall we slo
And awreke Ihesu christ of his fo
Forth went there a spy after then
And aspyed the hethen men
He aspyed their compassynge
And told it Richard our king
He cried horse and harneys their
And dyght them and made them yare
Anon lepte the king Richard
On his stead that hight lyarde
His english and his templers
They lepte anon on their destrers
And went in to the hethen host
In the name of the holy ghost
All the sarasynes with one noblaye
To the sowdan would their way
King Richard smote them among
There began a blysfull song
But to term agaunt and to mahowne
They cried help to sir plutowne
King Richard began down bear
Them thorugh the heart with a spear
And so he served an admyrayle
And five dukes without fail
Afterward his axe he drew
Many an hethen man he slew
Some he cloue unto the sadell right
And slew both swayne and knight
A king he cloue unto the arsowne
There halpe him naught mahowne
An earl he smote on the yren hode
That at the breast the axe withstode
There was full many a sarasyne
That he sent to hell pyne
They destroyed many a stead
So swyftely they began speed
His templers and his hospytalers
Came there on fair destrers
So long they fought says the storye
That they had the vyctorye
Thorugh help of his christian knights
Styffe in arms strong in fyghtes
And as many he slew alone
As they did euerychone
And many escaped with dethes wound
That lived after but a stounde
They would him no more mete
Richard by the way ne by street
Now may ye here of the winning
That wanne Richard our king
Horse of price and many a camayle
Five thousand and five hundred saunce fail
Six hundred horse of great coursers
All charged with rich tresers
That were in cofers fast I bound
With fine silver and gold full round
Mules he had three thousand and mo
That pannes and spyces bare tho
And five hundred of ass
Bare wine and oil more and less
And also many of whete read
There Richard did a noble deed
When he all that tresour wan
He went home to his man
In to betanye that cite noble
With that treasour and with that moble
He gave to high and to low
Of his purches good ynowe
He gave them stedes and coursers
So Richard parted his purches in fyers
Him betydde a well fair case
Of all crystendome lord he was
Soon after in a little stounde
There came two messengers of mounde
The bishop of chester was that one
That other the abbot of saint albone
And brought letters specyell
I sealed with the barons seell
They him told that king John^
Would do him the crown upon
At eester by the common dome
But ye the rather come home
For the king of france with envy
Was risen in normandye
Than said Richard by gods pain
The devil has now to much main
For all their boost and their deraye
Yet they shall bow some day
There they dwelled till halowmasse
And than he began to Iaffe pass
For seven year and for more
He began the castle to astore
Five thousand I find in book
He let there that castle look
For to keep well that land
Out of Salandynes hand
Till that come again he might
From england god it dyght
And than he thought to Acrys ward
That doughty body king Richard
Of Salandyn now begin I geste
That makes noise and great heste
Wroth he was and full sore amoued
For his tresour was thus robbed
And for his men were thus I slain
Therefore was him nothing feign
And said he would awreked be
When he might his time se
So that time came a spy in
And told thus to Salandyn
A lord be now blythe of mode
I the bring tidings good
To thy heart a blythe present
King Richard is to Acrys went
For over he will to england
Him is I come such a sonde
That Ihon^ his brother I the swear
Will his crown bear
Iaffe he has stored a right
With many a baron and hardy knight
Fyftene thousand I wot well
That shall keep the town and the castle
If he may so well speed
Till he come from his stead
Salandyn was ofre in well and woe
But never so merry as he was tho
The spy he gave an hundred besauntes
That the tidings brought to presauntes
And a right fair destrere
And robe furred with blaundemere
Than would he no longer abide
He sent about on every side
Upon lymbe and upon life
Upon children and upon wife
That they come to him belyue
To help him out of land drive
King Richard and his tail
To him came an admyrayle
Many a duke and many a king
And many an other great lordynge
Of egypt and of arabye
Of capadose and of barbarye
Of cyre and of asclomoyne
Of ynde and of babyloyne
Of great greece and tire also
Of many empyres and kingdoms to
Of all the hethen kings that I find
From the greeks see unto ynde
Charles the king ne Alysaunder
Of whom was made much sclaunder
Ne had never half the host
As in the country lay in coost
Five mile it lay in bread
And more I wene so god me read
And twenty it was of length
This was an host of great strength
There men might se great wonder
Of people that were without nombre
Iaffe they have about I set
Many a christian man to let
There were in a little thrawe
On both parties much folk I slawe
So stout and hard was the battle
That it fared without fail
As it had been from heaven light
So clear it was of swerdes bright
The christian men well fought
To slay the sarasynes they had in thought
They fared as of the earth they spronge
So many there were of old and young
That no slaughter of swerdes kene
In that battle might ben seen
Tho the christian fled in to the castle
And kept the gates swythe well
The sarasynes the cite nome
To their well and to their dome
Than began many a sarasyne
The castle wall to undermine
And the christian for the nones
To frusshe them both body and bones
The sarasynes yode about the wall
And shot in over all
And our men to them as swythe
Many of them they made vnblythe
They sought where they might best
Grieve the christian men mest
At the last a gate they fond
Not fast shot in they sonde
There they found a strong metynge
Of lances and swerdes caruynge
To ground they laid a thousand men
Of ours there were slain but ten
Though they were never so stout
At the gate they put them out
That day might they not speed
The sarasynes for no need
A knight by the moon clear
The christian sent a messengere
To king Richard to Acrys cite
And badde him for gods pity
That he should to help come
And else they were all I nome
They told him all the hard cas
Of the sowdan how it was
And but ye come to them anon
They ben but deed euerychone
Richard answered tho a plyght
Full well know I the sowdans fight
He will make but a deraye
At the walls and go his way
I will not for him to them wend
But soon I will them socour send
He cleped to him his neuewe
A baron of great vertewe
That hight Harry of champayne
And bad him wend to Iaffe plain
And said take with the this host
And abbate the sowdans boost
Horse and harneys he began cry
Among the host they should hye
And with sir Harry for to wend
And Iaffe help to desende
Against the cursed Salandyne
And awreke you of the sarasyne
On the morrow went sir Harry
And many a good knight hardy
Gascoynes spanyardes and lumbarde
For the bidding of king Richard
They went forth by the maryne
Till they came to palastryne
The sarasynes host there they seen
All the country full I wene
Of their coming the sawdan herd
Swythe toward them he ferde
When duke Harry this wyste
He fled again by Ihesu christ
And he made no tarynge
Till he came to Richard our king
And said he never saw ne herd
In all this wide myddell erde
Not half dele the people of men
That Salandyn has by down and den
No tongue he said may them tell
I wene they come out of hell
Than answered king Richard
Fie a deuylles thou foul cowarde
He shall I never by god above
Trust to frensshe man's love
The christian men that in Iaffe beth
They may wit the of their death
Thorugh thy defaude I am a dradde
My good barons ben bestadde
Now for the love of saint Marye
Swythe show me my galye
All tho that ever love me
To ship now for charity
All that ever wepen bear might
To ship the went anon right
And hyed them to Iaffe ward
With the doughty king Richard
Harken now how my tale goth
Though I swear to you none oath
I will you read romans none
Of pertenope ne of yponydone
Ne of Alysaunder ne of Charlemayne
Ne of Arthur ne of Gawayne
Ne of Lancelot de lake
Ne of Beuys ne Guy of Sydrake
Ne of Vry ne of Octauyan
Ne of Hector the strong man
Ne of Jason neither of Hercules
Ne of Eneas neither of Achylles
They ne wanne never parmafaye
In their time by their day
And anon of them so doughty deed
Ne so strong battle ne of felowrede
As did king Richard without fail
At Iaffe at that strong battle
With his axe and his sword
Assoyle his soul Ihesu lord
It was before mydnyght
Moan and sterre shone well bright
Richard was to Iaffe come
With his galayes all and some
And herkened toward the castle
If he might here taboure or flagell
And he naught could aspye
By voice ne by mynstrelsye
What quycke man in the castle ware
Tho became his heart full of care
Well sore than wept king Richard
Wrong his hondes and tare his barde
A Ihesu now thy socour
To long I have made soiour
Now slain is Roberte mortemere
That was earl of leycestere
Every here of him was worth a knight
And Roberte turnam that was so wight
And sir Brandys and sir Pyttarde
That in battle was wise and hard
And all my good barons
The best of all my regyons
They ben slain and all to tore
How might I longer live therefore
I might have saved all mine
If I had comen betyme
Certes I shall never be blythe man
Till I be awreked on the sowdan
Thus syghed king Richard aye
Till it came against the day
A wait there stood at a cornell
And pyped a note with a flagell
He ne pyped but one sithe
Many an heart he made blythe
He looked down and saw galyes
King Richard and his nauyes
Ship and sail well he knew
A merry note than he blewe
And cried seygnyours or sus sus
King Richard is come among us
When the christian herd this
Their hertes became light I wys
Earls barons squyers and knight
To the walls ran right
And saw king Richard their lord
And welcomed him with blythe word
And said lord welcome in gods name
All our sorrow is turned to game
Richard had never in heart Iwys
Half dele so much blys
Horse and harneys he cried their
Against the sarasynes for to fare
We ne have life but one
Sell we it dear both flesh and bone^
For to challenge our heritage
Slay we the sarasynes on evil rage
Who so him douteth for menace
Ne se he never in gods face
Take me mine axe in mine hand
It was made in england
No more their armure I ne doubt
Than it were a pylche cloute
The sothe to say men shall se
Thorugh gods help in trynyte
He was the first that on land did lepe
Of a dosyn he made an hepe
He began to cry with voice clear
Where ben these hethen pantenere
That have the cite of Iaffe I nome
With my pollaxe I am come
For to waraunt that I have do
Wassayll he said I drink you to
He laid on I say you a plyght
And slew the sarasynes down right
The sarasynes fled and went mate
Full fast out at the castle gate
In heart they were full of sorrow
That them thought the gate to narowe
And ran to the walls of the town
By every side they lepte down
And eueryche cried in this manner
Harken now and ye shall here
Malkan sterran nayre arbru
Loyre fermoyre touz memoru
That is for to say in english
The english devil I come is
And but we flee out of his way
An evil death shall we dye to day
They fled out of the town anon
Therein abode not so much as one
But four hundred or five
They were soon brought out of live
They lepte on their destreres
And at the gate set porters
King Richard lepte on fauell
Well armed in yren and in steel
And rode him out at the gate
The king of egypt he met therate
With syxty thousand of sarasynes fers
With arms bright and broad baners
Richard a duke on the helm hytte
Down to the ground he him slytte
Another he smote on the yren hode
That at his breast his sword stood
His templers and his barons
Fared right like wood lions
And slew the sarasynes swythe
As grass falls before the sithe
The sarasynes saw no better wone
But fled away euerychone
To Salandynes great host
That fyftene mile lay in coost
Syxty thousand as I you say
The sowdan lost that same day
For their armure fared as wax
Against king Rychardes axe
Many a sarasyne and high lordynge
Yielded them to Richard our king
Richard put them in hostage tho
There were a thousand prisoners and mo
The chase lasted swythe long
Till the time of euensonge
Richard rode after till it was night
So many of them to death he dyght
That no nombre it may accounte
How many of them it would amounte
Richard left without the town
And pyght there his pauylyowne
And that night with mylde heart
He comforted his barons smarte
And ye shall here on the morrow
How there was a day of sorrow
For the gretest battle I understand
That never was in any land
And ye that this battle will lere
Harken now and ye shall here
As king Richard sat at his soupere
And gladded his barons with mylde chere
And comforted them with ale and wine
Two messengers came from Salandyn
And stood king Richard before
With long berdes and with hoar
Of two mules they were a light
In gold and sylke they were I dyght
Either held other by the hand
And said king Richard now understand
Our lord Salandyn the high king
Has the sent this asking
If that thou were so hardy a knight
That thou durst him abide in fight
Till to morrow that it day ware
Of bliss thou should ben all bare
For thy life and for thy barons
He will not give two skalons
He will the take with strength of hondes
For he has folk of many lands
Egyens and of turkye
Of moryens and of arabye
Basyles and embosyens
Well eger knights of defens
Egypcyens and of surrye
Of ynde moror and of capadocye
Of medes and of asclamoyne
Of samarye and of babyloyne
Two hundred knights without fail
Five hundred of amarayle
The ground ne may them uneath bear
The folk that comes the to dear
By our read do right well
And turn again to Iaffe castle
In safe ward thou might there be
Till thou have sent after thy meyne
And if thou se thou may not stand
Turn again to thyn own land
In anger Richard took up a lofe
And in his hondes it all to rofe
And said to that sarasyne
God give the well evil pyne
And Salandyn your lord
The devil him hang with a cord
For your counseyll and your tydynge
God give you well evil ending
Now go and say to Salandyn
In despyte of his god appolyn
I will abide him betyme
Though he come to morrow or pryme
And though I were but my self alone
I would abide them euerychone
And if the dog will come to me
My bollaxe shall his bane be
And say that I him desire
And all his cursed company in fere
Go now and say to him thus
The curse have he of sweet Ihesus
The menssengers went to Salandyn
And all the beginning told him
Salandyn meruayled than
And said it was none erthly man
He is a devil or a saint
His might found I never faint
Anon he made his ordeynynge
For to take Richard the king
Thereof Richard took no keep
But all night lay and sleep
Till against the dawning
Than herd he a shyll cryenge
Thorugh gods grace an angel of heaven
Tho said to him with mylde steven
Arise and lepe on thy good stead fauell
And turn again to Iaffe castle
Thou haste slepte long I nough
Thou shalt find hard and tough
Or thou come to that cite
Thou shalt be wrapped and thy meyne
After the battle without leas
With the sowdan thou make thy peace
Take trues and let thy baronage
Unto the flome do their vyage
To Nazareth and to Bedlem
To Caluarye and to Iherusalem
And let them wend after then
And come thou after with thy shypmen
For enemies thou haste I understand
There in thine own land
Up said the angel and well the speed
Thou ne had never more need
Richard arose as he would wede
And lepte on fauell his good stead
And said lordynges or sus or sus
Thus has us warned sweet Ihesus
On arms he let cry their
Against the sarasynes for to fare
But Salandyn and his tem
Was between Iaffe and them
That was to Richard much pain
That he ne might his host ordain
Before he prycked on fauell
His spear did byte full well
Therewith he slew without doubt
Three kings of the sowdans route
His horse was styffe himself was good
Horse ne man him naught withstood
For to hew many an hethen cors
He did his might and his horse
He that had seen his countenance
Would him have had in remembrance
They began on him as fast drive
As bees done from the honey hyue
Whom that he hytte with his sword
Never after ne spoke he word
The english and frensshe began after ride
To fight they were fresshe that tide
Upon the sarasynes fast they donge
With swerdes and with lances strong
And smote hard with their might
And slew the sarasynes down right
And there was full little keep
So many of them were laid on sleep
That no slaughter without fail
Ne might ben seen in that battle
A mire there was without Iaffe
A mile long without less
Maugre them king Richard that sire
Three thousand drove in to the mire
The foul cursed hethen men
Lie and bathe them in the fen
And tho that would come up
Drank of Rychardes own cup
What adreynt and what I slawe
The sowdan lost of the hethen law
Syxty thousand in a little stounde
In the frensshe it is I found
Tho king Richard went again
To recomforte him with his men
Now he was here now he was there
To help them with his powere
Ne saw men never as I you tell
One man so many to ground fell
And in the most peril of the battle
King Richard saw without fail
His eem sir Harry of champayne
Field down of his horse in the plain
The sarasynes had him under hand
To slay him fast they began fond
It had been his day last
Had not Richard comen in haste
Richard cried with an hye voyse
A help god and the holy croyse
Mine eem to day fro shame thou shylde
From death of these dogs wild
Lordynges he said lay on
Ne let these dogs escape non
I my self shall prove to smite
If my pollaxe will ought byte
Tho men might se with main
How he shed blood and brain
Upon the place that grene was
Many a soul went to sathanas
The templers came to socoure
There began an hard shoure
They laid on as they were wode
The valeys ran all on blood
The long spaye was a doughty knight
As he were wode he began to fight
The king of martok he met in the field
With a spear he smote him in the shield
That he tombled without fail
Top sail over his horse tail
That on his heed he light
And brake his neck I you plyght
The earl of leycester sir Robarde
The earl of rychemonde and king Richard
There as these three knights rode
That day was the way all broad
That four carters might mete
So many of them there lost the sweet
On both parties was many a body
Slain that was full hardy
At the last with great pain
They wanne the earl of champayne
And brought him upon his stead
That swythe good was at need
And bad he should by him ride
Right by his own side
With that came a messenger reke
With king Richard for to speak
And said sir for charity
Turn again to Iaffe cite
Covered is both mount and plain
King Alysaunder ne Charlemayne
Ne had never half the route
As is the cite now about
Ye may in to the cite ride
In field what hap so ever betyde
And I you warn without fail
That much is payred of your battle
The patryarke I taken is
And John^ neuell I slain Iwys
Wyllyam of Arasyn and Gerarde
And bartram the braundys the good lumbarde
All these ben slain and many mo
King Richard bethought him tho
And began to cry turn arere
Every man with his banere
And of sarasynes thousands many one
To him gadered euerychone
And slew fauell under him
Tho was Richard wroth and grym
His axe from the arson he drew
The sarasynes therewith he slew
That had stycked under him his stead
Therefore they lost their hedes to mede
On foot he was and on foot he laid
Many an hundred under him dayed
All that his axe take might
Down he slew anon right
What before and what behind
A thousand sarasynes in book I find
He slew when he was on foot
That came there never none to bote
Salandynes two sons came ride
And ten thousand sarasynes by their side
And began to cry to king Richard
Yield the traitor thou foul cowarde
Or we shall the slay in this place
Thou lie quod Richard by gods grace
And with his axe he smote him so
That his myddell he carved in two
There half the body fell down
And that other half abode in the arsowne
Of the said Richard I am syker
His brother came to that byker
Upon a stead with great raundowne
As though the world should fall down
And gave Richard a wound thorugh the arm
That did Richard much harm
For on the spear heed was venym
And Richard stoutely smote to him
That horse and man he field to ground
Lie there quod Richard hethen hounde
Ne shalt thou never tell Salandyne
That thou dydest me my life to tyne
Than five dukes of hethenesse
Came with their host more and less
And beset about Richard our king
And thought all to death him bring
But Richard within a little thrawe
The five dukes he has I slawe
And many an hundred after then
All swythe doughty hethen men
At the last though it were late
Richard wanne to Iaffe gate
Tho were our christian well syker
That they should win that byker
The earl of leycester sir Robarde
Brought him his stead lyarde
King Richard in the sadell did lepe
Tho fled the sarasynes right as sheep
Richard rode after till it was night
And slew all that he take might
There was slain in plain and den
Ten hundred thousand hethen men
Tho might Richard without leas
Wend to the cite of Iaffe in peace
Tho he thanked the king of glory
And Marye of that vyctorye
For sith the world was begone
A fayrer battle was never won
On the morrow he sent sir Sabeuyle
And sir Roberte of waturuyle
Huberte and Roberte of turnam
Ganter offorte and John^ the saint John^
That himself and five of his men
Would fight against five hundred and ten
In wild field they would fight
And govern their goods right
And if they win thus that land
Ever in to christian men's hand
If the sarasynes might them sle
The land should ever their own be
And if they will not their own says
Say that three year and three days
I ask terms of the sowden
To wend to my land and come again
The messengers forth began wend
And told the tale word and end
And the sowdan would grant the battle
Five hundred against Richard saunce fail
On the morrow if he would come
The trues should ben I nome
And thus told the messengers
To king Richard that was so fers
The next day the sowdan made forward
Trues to take with king Richard
Thorugh all the land to the flome
To Acrys that would come
All the same three year
Christian men far ne nere
Might go to Iherusalem
To the sepulture and to bedlem
To olyuete and to nazarell
To Iaffe and to maiden castle
And to all other pylgrymages
Without harm or domages
How king Richard was slain before the castle gaylarde / and how the
castle was won / and all were slain that were therein.
THus king Richard ye doughty man
Peace made with the sowdan
And sith he came I understand
The way toward england
And thorugh treason was shot alas
At castle gaylarde there he was
The duke of estryche in the castle
With his host was dyght full well
Richard thought there to abide
The weder was hot in somer tide
At gaylarde under the castle
He wend he might have keled him well
His helm he abbated their
And made his vysage all bare
A spy there was in the castle
That espied Richard right well
And took an arblaste swythe strong
And a quarrel that was well long
And smote king Richard in tene
In the heed without wene
Richard let his helm down fall
And badde his men dyght them all
And swore by the sea and the son
Till the castle were I won
Ne should neither mete ne drink
Never in to his body synke
He set up robynet that tide
Upon the castelles side
And on that other half the one
He set up the matgryffone
To the castle he threw stones
And brake the walls for the nones
And so within a little tide
In to the castle they began ride
And slew before and behind
All tho that they might against them find
And ever was the quarrel by the led
Stycked still in Rychardes head
And when it was drawn out
He dyed soon without doubt
And he commanded in all thing
To his fader men should him bring
That they ne let for nesshe ne hard
Till he were at the font euerarde
At font euerarde wytterly
His bones lie his fader by
King Harry forsothe he hight
All england he held to right
King Richard was a conqueror
God give his soul much honor
No more of him in english is wrought
But Ihesu that us dear bought
Grant his soul rest and to
And ours when it comes thereto
And that it may so be
Say all amen for charity
Thus ends the story of the noble king Richard ever de lion. Enprynted at
London in ye Fletestrete at the sign of the son by Wynkyn de word / prynter
unto the most excellent pryncesse my lady the kings mother. In the year of our
lord god. M.CCCCC.ix.
