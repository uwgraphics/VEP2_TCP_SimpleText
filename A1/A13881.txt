A full and plain declaration of Ecclesiastical Discipline out off the word
off God / and off the declininge off the church off England from the same.

Imprinted. M.D.LXXIIII.

To the godly reader grace / and peace from God the father / and from our Lord
Jesus Christ.
IF off long time, and even almost from the beginning off the world, we
had not fully known, and tried the frovvardenesse off man's nature no doubt
all men would take it as a thing incredible, that any one could be found,
which would refuse, or not most desyrously embrace, so svvete and wholesome
discipline off Christ, as both is propounded to us in his word, and set forth
in order in this present book. Which as being simply considered it is
merueilous so truly seems a great deal more strange, if we way how
easily men are brought to admit that civil discipline (whereby the
commodities off this present life are kept) allthoughe hard and confirmed with
more severe punishments. But if we turn our eyes to the over hard and cruel
slaughter off the Popish Discipline, and mark a little with what quietness
and patience it was born: surely it must needs, not make us vvonder, but be
astonished. For what foolishnes is it, so mutch to care for this frail and
britle life, as not only to admit, but often times willingly to desire all
severity off discipline even though it be as great, as that off Lycurgus was:
and to be so backwards cither in gettinge or keeping off that life which
always shall endure: as not to yield to the most moderate, and best tempered
discipline off all that ever were? And if this blindness off men were
pardoned (which notvvithstanding at the le^ght shall most certainly be
punished) that it both loves more and follows with greater diligence, the
commodities off this inconstant life then of that which shall abide for ever:
what madness shall it be thought, that we have so quietly and easily borne,
that cruel boutchery off the Popish discipline whereby both body and soul,
have miserably been tormented: and so hardly or not at all to suffer, this most
souuerein medicine for our vices. For the laws off Discipline which we
there felt, written off the Roman dragon as it were with blood: we may here
try by our Savior Christ and the Apostles, vvritte^ (as one would say) with
milk. And this either ignorance of the world if it know not these things,
or pride if it refuse a known benefit, or other peevishness and peruersity
what soever, makes almost al good me^ to fear, lest the just God being
angry that his fatherly and gentle rod is contemned, and taking up his rod off
yro^ and justice: those churches that remain (which are very fevve) be
altogether broken, bruised into little pieces, even wholy as it were into small
cromes. Which thing as it makes me pensive for all churches generally,
where the Apostles discipline has no abiding, so for thee O England, to vvho^
being bound both by commune duty off a cytisen, and by public mynistery which
sometimes I exequuted, I confess that I owe all kind off great and special
duty) yt makes me mutch to doubt, and to be very careful.

I speak nothing off that unrevenged, and vnpurified shedinge off giltlesse
blood which was committed in the reign off Queen Mary, especially against
those which both were then the autours off that murder, and whose minds
thurst, and hands itche to commit the like wickedness again: only I
admonish, that off the rivers thereoff, which, run^e and ouerflovve in all
places, eue^ the least drop might be the destruction off a great, and most
mighty kingdom. Therefore to let these and other things pass, which are
not now to be spoken off: those bands off vices, vvhihe have proceeded partly
from the absence off the Apostles Discipline, partly from the presence off the
counterfeit thereoff, which remains with us since Popery, have weakened
our church with seidge off fourtene years together, and shortly will destroy
the same, except against those battering pieces and ca^nons off vices, we
speedely set the tre^che, and truly brazen vvale off the Apostels Discipline.
And I would to God thou hadest kept some mean there in (if there can be any
mean in Sinninge) and by thrustinge away the Discipline being offered,
hadest not more greiuously provoked, the wrath off God against the. For the
former things although they were heinous, yet because they came off
ignorance might the rather obtain some pardon: now when she hathc made her
self known unto us being iniuriousliy handled, and suffringe violence, it
is greatly to be feared off us, lest povvringe out her complainctes into the
bosom off her heavenly father (from vvho^ she comes) she kindle that wrath
against us where with all England onles it speedely repent, may shortly be
set on fire. The thinkinge off these things does often dismay me, and when I
greedely seek after, both hope off the health off England, and reasons
vvhereon to gather hope, they drive as it were all hope out off my breast. And
that so much the more because these many years, not only the exceadinge great
patience and long suffringe off God, striuinge with our hardness, and
greediness off sin that never rests) has put to flight our privy
enemies, scattered their companyes, brought to nothing their snares laid for
us both at home and abroad: but also that God has eft soones heaped nevve
benefits upon us or at least was ready to have heaped if we had been so
ready to receive as he to give, and had not suffered the opportunities which
were offered us, or rather put into our mouths to have slide^ from us. In
these so many, so great, so oulde and as it were hard houldlinge diseases,
although I be almost overcome both withdraw dispeire off recoueringe the
former health, and fear off losinge that which we have: yet cease I not
now and then to lift up my mind so thrown down, and to advance it to the
hope off a better estate off things.

Off which the foundations being laid, in the mercy off God which has no
end, I cherishe and confirm the same by certain signs, which I have
observed to that purpose. For calling to mind the former times, when I see
that mercy off God to have shined forth, and we not only not thinckinge off
it but almost with general consent off all men criynge out to the contrary)
to have given us light in the wholesome doctrine off the Gospel: now in the
leaninge, or rather affection off the greatest part off Gospellers both high
and low toward discipline, if I persuade my self that one day it shall
have place amongst us, I ought to seem not to have done it rashely. As for
that, that our most Excellent Prince, and some off the cheiff counseillers off
the Realm, unto whom our common wealth is committed, have hitherto been
small favorers off Discipline, although it seem to reach as it were even at
the throat off our church: yet becavvse all men understand that it is has
happened, as well by secret vvhisperinges as open accusations partly off
Bishopes, partly off those which stand for Bishoprics (which perceive
that they ca^ not stand, if the church stand and florishe) we dispeire not
of the good will, and readiness, off the prince, and her counseillers
toward this cause. For we hope when the vanity and falsenesse of
slanders, as off treason) Rebellion, destroyinge off common ^ealthes,
confusion, Anabaptisme, Donatisme (which all they lay upon discipline, and
those that are desirous thereoff) shall be seen we hope I say it will come to
pass, that those whom we have hitherto felt, som^ewhat est raunged from this
cause, we shall try hereafter freindly and favorable thereunto. For we so
trust to the goodness off the cause that we can hardely think it able to be
brought to pass, that it should be condemned not being hard, off so witty a
Prince, and so wise counseillers. Now whereas Her Majesty, according to the
excellent learning and amongst women without all comparison, which she
has, is delighted with things that are written in latin: we have
conceived great hope, that this cause which hitherto she has tasted here and
there, out off the false rumores off those which deal iniustly with us, as it
were out of the channels, shall more fully be drawn out of our own books,
as it were out off the founteines. Which that she would do we throwinge
down our selves at Her Majesty's feet do in most humble manner and with all
supplication beseech Her, in the name off Christ (whose matter this is) the
noblest, and far most excellent off all Kings. And in this place, I mark an
other sign, to confirm my mind in the mercy off God: that our merciful
Father, has provided a notable vvorckman, whose breast he has filled with
all kind off treasures, both off arts and tongues.

Now saying that he has framed a Bezaleel for us, to make the vessels and
instruments off the Tabernacle, he seems not as yet to have clean left, off
to think, off repayringe the ruins off our Church. For he has so behaved
him selffe in a cause (both for the diverse judgments off many, and the
fevvnesse off those that have writ thereoff) most hard: as it seems, scant
that any thing could have been taught either more exactly, or more plainly, in
one which had been, both allowed by all men's opinions, and commonly
written upon by many. For Discipline shevvethe her self, and comes forth
openly in the sight off all men, not only with good words and excellent
sentences, as it were arrayed with costly garments, but also the same as it
were with method, comely plaitted and seemly girded. And whereas the very
matter off Discipline, is off it self amiable and lovely, being decked withdraw
Rhetoric, Logic, diversity off tounges, pureness off speech, knowledge
in the civil Law, as it were withdraw broidures, what love ought it to
kindle in the minds off men? Now if this fruit to read and look upon has
pleasure in it, how mutche more pleasant and svvet shall it be to taste? But
if any will say, that I give over hasty judgment in this matter, I am
content to lose so mutch off mine estimation (if I have any) as shall seem to
be vvanting either off judgment, or learning to this little book. Discipline
therefore having twice suffered repulse at our hands comes unto us the
third time, the same which she was before, but with greater train, and
orname^tes (as are meet for a most noble dauhter of the noblest king.
Wherefore onles we will try the sharpness off the wrath and displeasure
off God, let us go forth to meet her coming, let us open unto her all the
gates and haue^s off the realm, let us run into her most louinge arms, let us
give her the kiss off love and reverence, finally let us both receive her
willingly, and keep her constantly, with all kind off service and duty. For
that which happens sometime to Princes that hide them selves under baser
apparel, that they are not greatly angry though they be not known off their
subjects, but when they shevve them selves in princely array and furniture,
are offended greiuously if they be not acknowledged: the same doubtless
shall we try in this prince. For if hitherto she either more basely
appareilled, or having a veil before her face, and not suffringe men to
know her fully, has kept in her anger within her breast: yet surely she
will nevver suffer so great brightness to be contemned, or refused, as may
perce the eyes even off men that are blind. And if they which disdain a
costly gift being offered in an earthen vessel, are vvorthely punished for
their rashenesse: certainly they shall never escape a most greiuous punishment
off their madness, which despise it being given in a gorgeous and costly
dis he. Hereunto may be added that the author off the book, not buklinge him
selffe with any adversary, and having his mind bent only on the cause,
inueieth not against any man's person. VVherin having understood off some in
part offended with me modestly ansvveringe an importunate man, and lightely
stinginge him again, which thrust others thorovve with most sharp
reproaches: surely as I am sorry that they are displeased withdraw me, so I rejoice
for their cause, that in this treatise all comparison off persons being
separated, they shall have nothing, which may offend such minds as are
somevvhat to deinty. Wherefore I have done my endeavor, that I might bring to
light, this (both for these and other causes) so excellent a Jewel,
committed to my custody, being persuaded, that I could not, vvitheout the
heinous sin off sacrilege, have buried in silence as it were in grave, so
notable a thresure. Which truly I have done so faithfully, that allthoughe I
savve him differinge from me in the interpretation off a place or two
notwithstanding I have left them unchanged, and reserved them whole to the
judgment off the church.

It remains o England, that thou for whose sake all this pain is taken,
bring unto the readinge hereoff a mind void of all affection, neither hindered
with any error of custom, nor dismayed with the vain noyes and pomp off
Bishopes, nor ru^ninge headlonge withdraw any prejudice, or desire off
mainteninge any side: that thou look only upon the matter, try the weight
off every argument, not by the deceitful scoles off men, or off the greatest,
but by the authority off the word off God, as it were by the gouldsmithes
vveightes, that thou acknovvledge the truth once knovve^, keep it in thy
mind, bring it into practice (every one so far as his vocation will suffer)
as it were into present possession. Now I most humbly beseech god the father
off our Lord Jesus Christ, that out off the threasures off his vvisdome and
strenght, both openinge thine eyes to see, and strenghtheninge thy hands to
put in execution, he would vouchsafe to perfect, and alvvayes to continevve,
the good thing which is begone in thee.

Necessitye off Disciplyne.
THe manner off government in all human societies / is off greatest force and
power either to the preseruacion or overthrow off the same for there is no
common wealth be it never so small / no not a house that can be preserved
without some certain manner off government and discipline. And those Kingdoms
and commonweals hawe always most notably flourished and longest continewed /
which first off all were set in good order off government / and afterward
kept the same without any alteracion or change. As contrariwise the
destruction off greatest commonweals and most flourishing states have follwed
/ where either the order of government was ill appointed in the beginning / or
else being well begone / was afterward / altered and neglected for Policy
/ government / and good laws / are in city or any common wealth what soever
/ as the helm is to the ship / the wrest to the Instrument / Order to an
Army / and as the soul is to the body.

Hereoff yt came that Athens which was so famous a city after it could no
longer hold / and stere this helm / was tossed with every wave and storm /
and in the end perished and was overthrown. And hereby also that ancient
city of Lacedemon changing the severe laws off Lycurgus changed also her
estate / even as a song is changed by altering the time and note in which it
was first set. Hereby the Romans commonwealthe or Army rather / after that
they left the severity off the law off Arms / and warlyke discipline
whereby they did allwaies more prevail then by might and power / lost also
there ancient glory and renown. And to conclude / Hereoff comes that we see
now every where so many towns fallen to ruin / and lying like the dead
carkases off the cities which some times they have been / because that by
changing there old government by little and little / at the last the whole
state was lost / and went away as the soul from the body.

And even as the monumentes off the Greek and Lattin writers do witness
these things to have chanced to many commonweals and other societies and
companyes / eue^ so we read in the holy histories that the church (which is
a certain society and company off such as profess the true service off
God) with no less danger neglected the discipline and order / which God there
most loui^g and wise lawegeuer had appointed them to be ruled bye yea to there
much greater loss and punishment / for that (besides those incommodities
which are wont to chance unto others bye changing good laws) They always
found by experience / that the lord God there law geuer was ready to punish
and revenge the contempt off his discipline and order. for to pass over the
punishment off God upon the church off the Jews / whosoever does diligently
and attentively read the history off the Christian Church / shall well
understand that the calamity off the former times in which the Church lay
Dead as it were by the space off many years came off no other cause / then
off the contempt off the most wholesome and most holy Ordinances whereupon yt
was grownded by our Lord and Savior Christ / that it might have endured for
ever. Therefore it is a wonder te see (whereas our merciful God off his
vnspeable goodness and by a singular miracle / even now off late within the
memory off our fathers has raised up the church as it were out off the grave
again / by the voice off the Gospel) that so few are careful for the
maynteining and preserving off this life / and that being content as it were to
be in good health by preaching off the gospel / they care not for discipline
/ whereby this health may be the better preserved / and also the strength
and beawtie (which was lost by former sickness) be recouerd and gotten again.

And surely / it is greatly to be feared / lest that they (if they go thus
on stille and continewe to contemn so necessary an aid) fall again into the
calamities off the former times / and lest that these later times become worse
and more miserable then the former. But I am most off all afraid for our
Church off England / which by the space off so many years as it has already
embraced the Gospel / not only thincketh not off instituting a lawful
Discipline therein / but in a manner uses only that / which it has received
from the Papists / nor will not be persuaded to receive and embrace that
Discipline which Christ and his Apostels have left unto us: whose state
hitherto has been this until the time off king Henry the eight his reign /
for a long space before / it had lien dead and as it were without any life.
Then at the length by the greater favor and grace off God toward us /
diverse notable men rose up / who / as Elias and Elizeus raised up the children
which were dead / So they likewise by most earnest prayer and cherishyng yt by
all means got at the last some life into yt / so that at the length / yt
began as it were to wexe warm and neese: and by certain articles off sound
doctrine / to show some tokens off a Church reviving again.

And after wards / in the time of Edward the sixthe a prince off singular hope
and towardnes in all godlynes and vertewe / was fully revived / and recouereed
not only her life / but also her health again. But our church being thus
recovered / was contented with physic only and good diette for her health
/ and used no exercise to get her color and strength again / for although
many did exhort to abolishe that popish tyranny which then was still
remaining in the policy off the Church / and to place in stead theroff a
just and lawful manner off government according to the word off God / (which
thing especially that famous man Marten Bucer being then a stranger in England
/ did in that book which he wrote of the Kingdom off Christ) yet could not
England be browght to leave that form of gouerni^g the church / whereunto it
had been accustomed under Popery / but divided and separated asonder the
doctrine and discipline off the Gospel / twoe things / which both by there
own nature / and also by the commandment off God are to be joined together.
But forasmuch as health can not long be kept and preserved without due and
moderate exercise / not long after / namely in those most cruel times off
Queen mary / it fell sick again / that it was not only in danger off
death but in a manner past all hope to recover again. And surely even then
our church had out off doubt been utterly destroyed (as in deed it was
browght all to ashes) unless that heavenly Son Jesus Christ had quickened
yt being more then half Dead / and raised yt up like a Phoenix out off the
ashes again: And except our most noble Queen Elizabeth had risen up as a
mother in Israel / to travel with and bring forth our church again.

But this new birth has not as yet been any more happy towching the
restoring of discipline then were the former times. Therefore I thowght yt my
dewtie / even for the kind affection which I bear to that church in which I
have been both borne and browght up and therefore love most dearly for good
causes (even as the Apostle says to 2. Corr. 7.3.
live and die together) I thought yt I say my dewtie to desire and beseech
this Church earnestly and carefully to think / off this so great a
benefyte / whereby yt may be established for ever: And most earnestly to
exhort and admonish yt to abolishe that popish tyranny / which yet
remains in the government thereoff / and to restore again the most holy
policy off^^ (...) the church / which our Savior Christ has (...) unto us
/ and to fear / lest that the lord will punishers and will be revenged off us
/ if we contynewe still to despise his discipline.

But forasmuch as there be many who (because they delight rather in a fair
owtwarde show / then the true symplicitie off the Gospel) strive and contend
to retain still this Popish Hierarchy and conterfaite manner off governing
the church / blaming that order for many causes / which we persuade unto /
This whole controversy is fully and at large to be disputed of: that when
they understand the good cause that we have to repriue the one / and require
the other / they may join together with us in earnest prayers unto god / and
humble suyte unto her majesty / That this Popish tyranny being at the last
utterly abolished and clean taken away / In place theroff a better and more
holy government of the church accoding to Gods word may be established.

Which cause I purpose so to handle that first drawing out the right pattern
and platform off the lawful policy and government off the church / as
Christ and his Apostles have left it unto us / together their withal I will
note our faults and errors in every point / that by this comparison the
trewthe may more clerelie shine and appear / first therefore seeing we have not
to do with such as reiecte all discipline off the Church / that yt may be
better understood what it is whereoff we dispute / I will declare what the
lawful discipline off the church / is.

I call therefore Ecclesiastical Discipline, the policy off the Church off
Christ ordained and appointed / off God for the good administracion and
government off the same. what discipline is.
That I make here / God the Author off discipline (whereupon yt follows that
we have to fetch the rules thereoff from no other fountains but from the
holy scriptures) had need be more fully proved / because it is denied by many
who dare affirm that there is no precepte given touching this matter / but
contend that it is wholly left unto judgment of the magestrate and off the
church. first then let the^ tell us why they deny that god has thus
carefully provided for Christian Churches / and why they affirm yt to be
left free for us to rule it as we lift / seeing that in the old church off
the Jews / All things which perteined not only to the government off the
cyuile state but also off the Ecclesiastical (for although with them god was
Author of both / yet he would have them distinguished the on from the other)
were so diligently and exactelie distributed and both commanded by god and
commended to writing by Moses / that yt was expresslye forbidden / that Nothing
should be added unto yt nor taken from yt? For yt appreareth manyfestlye that /
that exact pattern off Discipline came not first from Moses / but from God /
by this that Moses testifies so often that the lord had appointed the manner
off creating and ordeining Ecclesiastical officiers / and and there power and
authority / who aso allwaies ready to punyshe the transgressors off his
ordinances with most grievous plages / and punyshementes.

There is a notable history in the ninthe off No^bers / off certain unclean
persons who thincking yt no sufficient cause / why they should not eat the
Passover with the rest off Israel / because they were polluted with touching
off a dead body / which they must needs do seeing there died daily some
emonghest them as off necessitye yt comes to pass in so great a multitude /
went to Moses and Aaron / desiring that they might not be secluded from that
solemn communion off the church. But what does Moses in this case? what
takes he upon him? Surely nothing at all but refers the cause wholly unto
God / by whose answer they were forbidden to eat the Passover with the rest
off Israel / and were put off unto the next month. Off which cause properly
belonging to this Discipline which we handle and referred to God / yt may be
clearlie understood / That Moses in all the government off the church did
nothing by his private authority / but only delivered unto them that which
the lord had commanded: which thing also Moses him self does plainly
testefie / by his often repeating off these words / As the Lord had commanded.
And this is that faithfulness which the Apostle to the Hebrews commends in
him / that he ruled not the house off God by his own will / but by the
authority off the Lord the master off the howsholde. Hebr. 3.3.


And how preciselie is yt commanded in the Tabernacle that all should be made
after the fasho^ and pattern which had been showed by the Lord in the
Montaine? Exodus 25, 40.
neither so long as kings were in any tolerable state / Any / either kings
or priests / took upon them any such authority to appointe matters belonging
to the church / but all things were ruled and governed according to the will
and authority off God. For whereas in the fashion and buiding off the temple
and in the offices off the levites and off the Singers / certain things were
/ somewhat otherwise appointed by danid and Solomon then they had been
commanded by Moses That change and alreracion was not made by the authority
off David and Solomon as kings / but by the will off God himself who appointed
yt so by his Prophets as appears / in the 2. Chro. 8.14.29. and 25.
Chronicles. Therefore also the fashion and pattern of the temple after it was
overthrown / was so exactelie drawn out Ezechie. 40. and 41. and 42.
by Ezechiell that the new temple might he builled again according to the
pattern off God showed by his Prophet. Wherefore also Erra and Nehemiah exact
all there reformacion to the pattern off Moses / David / and Ezechiel.

Seeing then so stable and certain a rule off governing the church contynewed
unto Christ / the laws and ordinances were appointed by god him self / and
that it was accounted wicked and unlawful for any man boldlye to have taken
any thing in hand in these matters / and that such as did so / eschaped not
the grievous punishment and vengaunce off God / why do they now at the last
deliver god off this care / or rather spoil the church off her patron and
defender / by whose government / yt might be preserved / and who sitting in the
stern at the helm yt never feared any storms or tempests / but was allwaies
safe in all danger. And how absurd and unreasonable a thing is it / then
especially to think the love and care off God to be demynished toward his
church when he has testified yt with a most certain and undoubted testemony
/ that is to say / by the sendyng off his only begotten son to take away
our sins / and as the Prophet off God / to declare all the Lords will and
counsel toward us / and to rule the church by his own authority. For this
is that Prophet like unto Moses / who should plainly and perfectly declare
unto us of God all things which do belong unto our dewtie / whom we ought
to hear and to obey / as the holy ghost by the mowthe off Peter has
expounded that promise / and by that heavenly voice which testefied off him
from heaven that he was the dear and only begotten son off god / in whom
the father was well pleased and commanded us to hear him. Arts 3.22.
Matthew. 17.5.
But how should we think him to be like unto Moses / yff he either has
wholly omitted / or not so clearlie and perfectelie (as far as was needful for
us showed and declared / this doctrine off the manner off governing the church
being so necessary / and which Moses has so diligently and faithfully
declared.

Thefore we must conclude if we acknowledge Christ to be that Prophette /
that he has fully and perfectly declared unto us / whatsoever was needful
for the government off the church: except we will rob hi^ of some part off
his Prophetical office / or prefer a seruate be he never so faithful /
before the only begotten son / and as yt were Eliezer before Isaac in his
fathers house / which surely they do / who think the seruante to haur
omitted nothing in this behalffe / that the heir has omitted all: Eliezer,
was Abraham's servant whose faithfulness is showed in that 24. off Genes.
and that Moses left all things perfect / but Christ either began them
not / or did not fynishe that which he began. Now whereas I affirm that
Christ has left us so parfecte a rule and Discipline / I understand yt off
that discipline which is common and general to all the church / and
perpetual for all times / and so necessary / that without yt this whole
society and company and Christian common wealth / cannot well be kept /
under there Prince and king Jesus Christ. And surely we must needs / either
confess that Christ has left us such an order to live by or else spoil
him off his kingly office. For what does more belong unto the name office and
dewtie off a king / then to give laws unto his cytezens and subjects* and to
make such decrees and ordinances whereby all the parts off his kingdom may
be maintained. The Papists indeed deny it / and dispute against us and
contend that it is lawful for there high priest to rule and order the
church off God as he lists: but we who do detest and abhor this
blasphemous voice and according to gods word aknowledge and confess Christ
to be the only king off the church. how can we say / either that he neglected
so great and so necessary a point off his Kingly office / or that he has
left yt us to order as we please.

But yff there be any whose speech is so contrary to it self / that they
grant Christ to be the King and law geuer off the church / and yet will
say that either he made no laws touching tht government off his people / or
fewer then were needful: Let them consider how little they differ from the
Papists in this poincte / and how vnhonorably and irreverently they speak off
Christ our Lord. For yff he has not set in order the whole state off his
kingdom / if he has not appointed officers / and declared the dewtie and
authority off every one / yff he has not appointed what should be the order
off courts and off Justice / if he has taken no order how the controversies
off his subjects may be ended: he has less provided for his church / then
not only Moses did for the Jews / but then Lycurgus / Solon / Numa / and other
lawegeuers off the gentiles / provided for there cities and commonweals.
Which yff we confess / what shall become off that famous kingdom which the
Prophets set out with such pomp and glory / what shall become off that
septer off Justice and that Chariotte Psalm. 45.7.5.
wherein David describes him sitting in the midst off the church. Which
although we grant properly to belong to the kingdom off Christ in heaven
affter th^s life / yet are those Prophecies not so wholly to be referred
thereunto / but that they have also some relacion to the beginning off his
kingdom in this life.

For seeing his kingdom / in this life differs from the other by reason and
certain respect only / and is not altogether off an other kind / so that the
things which are here begone shall then be fully accomplished: There is a
certain proporcion to be considered here / and all those prophecies are after
a sort also to be expopounded off this kingdom. As / where yt is prophesied
that in the kingdom off Christ all things shall be ordered by perfect Justice
and equity / that all his subjects shall be obedient and full off heavenly
knowledge / that there shall be no Cananyte in all the land / that the
gentiles shall be shut out off the city off god / and such other things
which the prophets most worthelie and notably have set out: Esaie. 32.1.4.
and 35.5.6.7.8.9. Zachar. 14.21.
we must understand / that all these things after a certain manner are to be
referred also to his Kingdom in this life / and declares that the government
of this Kingdom of his church here / owght also to be just and equal / that
the faithful who are his subjects / owght not to be brutishe and ignoraunte /
but as conning in heavenly matters and as full off that knowledge as may be:
That men off vicious life and given to all sin and wickedness / are to be cast
out and banyshed from the church / and the temple off god / to be kept as
nere as is possible free and clean from all pollutions and prophanacions.
Further also / they are convicted by the whole historye off the Gospel and by
the writings off the Apostles / by which it appears / that he has left
unto us fully / all things which were needful for the administracion off
government off his kingdom. For how often talked he with his disciples
touching this kingdom? Luke 9.58.
How often did he declare what manner off kingdom yt was? namely that yt was
no kingdom off this werlde / that it handled not the busynes and affairs off
this life but such only as parteine to the mind and conscience. Luke
12.13.14. Luke 21.25.26. John 19.36 Math. 18.15.15.17.
How often did he declare / what his officers should be / na^ely no gracious
nor honorable Lords / but ministers off the church? How exactelie did he
apointe the order off his courts and justice that no thing more could be
required to a right government / and lawful pollicye? yea / eue^ a little
before that he went from his / disciples how earnestlye and how carefully
co^me^ded he the charge off his kingdom unto them? how great authority gave
he them to shut or open heaven? and (so great was his care for the dew
administering off his kingdom) even then when he took his triumphant chariotte
/ wherewith he was after carried into heaven / that sitting there / he might
enjoy his kingdom / everlastingly) how carefully and how long (even for the
space off forty days together) did he talk with his disciples touching his
kingdom? For these are those charges and commandments which S. Luk / and S.
Mathewe do write that he gave to his Apostels and Ambassadors off the
administracion and government off his empire: Act. 1.2.3.4. Math. 28.20.
and whereoff he commanded them to give his subjects warning to keep them with
all dewtie and reverence.

And after he was set in his kingly throne / do we not see how he provided
all things which were necessary not only for the first foundation off the
church by means off Apostels and prophets / but also for the preseruacion off
it forever by Pastors and Doctors? Ephe. 4.8.10.11.
But that I be not longer then is needful in so clear a matter / how came yt
to pass that there was one order form and discipline off all the churches
which were founded by the Apostels / except they received the pattern from
Christ him self / which they thowght not lawful to alter and change.

And S. Paul seeing he had no more received this part touching discipline from
the Apostels / then the rest off ^he Gospel (for he had established many
godly churches many years before that he had conferred with them off his
doctrine) from whence I say received he all that form and order off
establishung the church by / except he were taught off Christ by reuelacion
as well concerning this / as concerning the rest off the Gospel? But I will
shut up all this matter touching the original off discipline / that it comes
from god / and is therefore unchangeable and perpetual and common to all
churches / with that earnest charge which S. Paul gives Timothy touching the
keeping and manteining theroff. 1. Timoth. 6.13.
who having tawght his scholar all the order off ruling the house off God which
is the church / I charge the (says he) in the sight off that God which
quickneth all things / and Jesus Christ who made that worthy confession
before Pontius Pilate / that thou keep these precepts without bla^e or reprofe
even to that notable coming off our lord Jesus Christ: and so forth as the
Apostle with most earnest words does charge him. Off which place / I gather /
first that almighty God and our Savior Jesus Christ are the authors off
that discipline which S. Paul had taught in that epistle. forasmuch as they
are noted to be the punyshers and auengers off all those who shall break yt. I
note further also that this order off discipline is constaunte and unchangeable:
which may neither be broken for any man's power or authority / nor altered for
any man's favor: seeing that it is not only called a commandment / but is given
also with such a charge: Tymothie being warned before the allmigtie God / and
our Savior Jesus Christ / to bear him self therein without blame and reprofe.
Last off all that yt is no commandment belong^ng to any certain time / but
perpetual / and perteyning to all times and states off the church. Seeing yt
is so expresselie commanded that it should be kept unto the coming off our
lord Jesus Christ. But how blame worthy were many afterward / and how
fowlie stained with the transgression off this holy commandment: for at the
last / Satan that conning workman to dostroie the church / having made them to
forgette this earnest charge off the Apostle / and having laid to the walls
off the church those twoe engines off Couetoussnes and Ambicion / which
destroy as well churches as cities / did cast down the strong holds whereby
it was mayntened and preserved.

But what did these so great Patrones and Protectors? how grieuouslie did they
punyshe not only the necligence off men but there sinful and unfaithful
wickedness? The stories do testify / how that by little and little with the
corruption off Discipline / Doctrine also began to be corrupted until that
at the last / they were both almost clean taken away and the church
abolished. For they know not I say plainly they know not / who being
content with the doctrine off the Gospel neglecte discipline / that the
disposicion and nature of these two / is like the disposicion off twoe sisters
who are twines: or off those brotherne off whom Hypocrates speaks: who
began to be sick together / and to amend together / so that fot the
natural inclinacio^ and disposicio^ of the one toward the other / they were
affected one with the others health and infirmity. Wherefore / seeing that god
of his infinite goodness gathered together again our church in these days /
and that true doctrine as the elder sister is recovered / let us not hinder
her (as her nature is if she be not hindered) to affecte also discipline with
her health that as it began to be sick together with doctrine / yt may be
also recovered together with yt.

And let us be moved with the remembrance of the former calamities / to the
restoring again of a pure government off the church except we esteem it not
to have the almighty god and our Savior Jesus Christ ready to punyshe us and
to be revenged on us for the neglecte off his discipline / and to know at the
last to our great peril and danger / how necessary it is for the church
and how acceptable unto god.

But why do I say lest we know at the last / seeing that we have already
proved not many years since / by the banyshement and fliing off subjects / by
s^ so crewell burning and murdryng off our brethren and horrible wastyng of our
church / how greatly the former reformacion being not sincere as it owght to
have been / displeased our Lord and God. But to return to that from whence I
have digressed / I think it plain and manifest by that which has been said
which I purposed to prove in the beginning: that is to say / that the rule and
pattern off discipline / is not to be drawn from the ordinances and fantasies
off men / but from the word off god. which thing / as it has long time
preserved purity and sincerity in those churches wherein all things are
reformed according to gods word / So all the corruptions which are in our
church this day / spring from no other head / then this / that we have
followed popish dreams and fantasies as most stickyng syncks and chanells
leaving the pure fountames off the word off God. For I see and perceive / that
the master Builders off our church in repairing off yt again were so wholly
bent unto the doctrine / that they never thowght off Discipline and so retained
yt still almost wholly such / as it was amonghest the Papists. whereupon it
comes that all the government of our church is not taken out of Gods word
but out off the cannon law and decrees off Popes. Which / wither it were done
by reason off the ignorance off those days or off negligence / or for
ambicion and vain glory or because they thought that popish discipline might
be tolerated for a time / or for what purpose soever / Surely no man can
doubt / but that yt was to the great hindraunce and discommoditie off the
church / which knows it throwglie and with dilige^tlie considers / how
small fruit has growe^ off so long travail and labor in the preaching off the
gospel. Out off this Ca^non law / came all that romyshe Hierarchy / primates
/ Archbishoppes / Lord Bishops / Chancellors Achdeacons / and there servants
Officialls / Commissaries and therest off that Trashe / by whom the church as
it were taken prisoner / is now off long time kept in prison and bondage. From
hence comes also that romische court / whereon a most shameful markete off
unlawful and wicked dispensacions / and all gainful means off destrouing the
church is kept, would to God / that we had rather suffered the papists when
they were cast out to have gone away with there bag and baggage / and that
we had not had so great a desire / to be enriched by these spoils and prays.

This is not (believe me) to he enriched with the Jewels off the Egyptians /
but to be infected with there boy^es and soars. These ear ringe^ and Egyptian
ornaments which we have gotten / are fytter to make a golden calfe with / then
to adorn and beautify the tabernacle off god. Therefore let us send them back
again from whence they come / and at the last take in hand an earnest and
sincere reformacion off the church. Let us abrogate and abolishe the
authority off this Canon law / then the which there is nothing less
canonycall / and which is the first and greatest fault in our discipline and
the fountain and original off all the rest: and Let this be the first article
off the new reformacion / that all things be exacted as nere as may be unto
the word off God. That our particular laws grownde upon this foundacon / and
let so much be admitted for Ecclesiastical discipline / as may be confirmed by
the voice and authority off God him self. And thus much let yt suffice
generally to have spoken / what discipline is.

Now let us devide the rest off this treatise (as almost all politic doctrine
is wont to be deuaded) into two parts: Division of discipline.
whereoff the first / declares that which belongs unto them / who bare any
office or have any charge in the church: the other part briefly touches the
dewtie off the rest off the body off the church. For as the Apostle says /
all the body is not one membre / nor all axe not Prophets or Doctors but
there is a certain diversity and dinstinction off Offices as off members
whereby the whole body is preserved. 1. Corrint. 32.19.29.
All which diversity and difference / is divided by the Apostle into two
sorts / who in the Epistle to the Corrinches / calls some / Fellow helpers
and laborers naming the rest off the church / by the name off Saints. 1.
Corrint. 10.15.16.
Thus also the Apostle to the Hebrews deuideth the church / into those who
had the oversight / and into the rest off the Saints / Now to speak first
off the former part / it is to be understood / that to the bearing off any
ecclesiastical office / there is a certain vocation and calling to be used /
which a man owght to wait for / being necessary to the taking upon him off
any charge what soever: Heb. 13 24.
which manner off apointing to an office wither we call it Creation / or
Assignacion / or as the ecclesiastical writers do most usually Vocacion It is
the apointement off God to the bearing off some office in his church / in
such sort and manner as he has ordained for every officer to be appointed by.

Which calling to the Bearing or the excuting off any ecclesiastical charge
and function / has all times been holde^ so necessary / that no man has been
thowght to exercise any lawful authority therein / who had not first off all
in his own conscience witness off the calling off God thereunto / and after
also off the church apointing him according to Gods decree and ordinance.
Hebr. 4.5.
For that sentence off the Apostle is general / that no man owght to take this
honor unto him / but he that is called thereto / as was Aaron.

For this doctrine off the necessytie of a Voca^on and Calling / did not so
once grow ou^ off that noble rod off Aaron together with the Almandes / that
yt fell afterward also from the tree together with them / but this Alma^d
three off Aaron / set and planted by the wit and labor off Moses /
florisheth even to this day: So that we may yet gather this doctrine off yt /
which is much more precious then any Almondes or other fruit what soever.

Nere to the same place in Moses / is rehearsed also a notable judgment off God
whereby yt seems that the lord meant to ratefie this law off the necessitye
off Vocation for ever: Nomb. 17.^.
wherein we see that neither the heavens could abide to look upon / nor the
earth to bear / so shameless boldness / but the one melting consumed with fire
such as without a calling would take upon the^ the priesthood / and the earth
gaping and opening it self swallowed the^ up alive. which owght to be a lesson
to us for ever / not only as Moses writes / ^. Samuel. ^^.
that not man burn incense before the lord but only they which are off the
stock off Aaron / and are thereby called thereunto / but also that no man be
so bold as to pervert or alter that order which God has established in his
church / and to arrogate unto hi^ that honor which he has by no right or
lawful calli^g obtained. Hitherto belongs also that which is written off
Peers vzzach / that is to say off the breach which the lord made in vzzach
who was stricken suddenly to death / only for that beyond the bonds off his
calling he put to his hand and held up the arcke of God which shaked and was
ready to fall / which was lawful only for the Levites to touch.

So the the Lord did no more spare Vzza attempting beyond his vocacion to
touch the arc / although his intent and purpose were never so good / then he
had pardoned before Aarons kinsmen. But if we require yet witnesses of greater
authority / we may read / that king vzziah was stricken with the leprosy /
for that being not content with his kingly office / he would have taken upon
him the Priests office also. 2. King. 15.5.
Thus the lord has ratified and sealed up this part of discipline with most
grievous and fearful punyshement / and the same not once but oftentimes
executed to this intent / that this law might for ever be off such authority
in the church / that no man should ever dare to be so bold and hardy as to
break yt.

Wherefore / seeing that god never forgave or left unpunished this fault in
any degree / state / or person but punyshed the levites / and even Aarons own
house and family / Satan and Abyram also being Princes off tribes / yea
Vzziah being a king / and that so sharply and severely: Nomb. 1^ 32.35.
so great punisheme^t in such personages / fire from god / the earth opening
her mowthe / Sudden death / and the most fylthie disease off the leprosy /
owght to stricke such a fear into our hearts / that we suffer not sacred
functions and offices / to be profaned by volo^tarie officers / and such as
take them upon them / without any lawful vocacion and calling. But how little
we are afraid thereoff / and how in this behalf that Discipline is neglected
in establishing whereoff / God has travailed so carefully / it is to / to
manifest / whereas popish priests take in hand to be mynisters off the
Gospel^ / whereas women and mydwiues / administer baptism emonghest us / and
Chau^cellors Archedeacons / Commissariers / and such like / deal in the
discipline and government off the church without any lawful calling.

For as for popish priests I speak off those who do take the ministry
upon ^hen without any new calling / allowing off / or appointing them
thereunto / but only stand upon the right off those horrible orders / whereby
they were ordained to sacrifice for the quick and the dead / that is to say
to abolyshe the sacrifie off our Savior Christ who can deny but that this
there shameless boldenes is clean contrary to the most just and equal laws
which the Lord has made touching the necessity off vocacion? For although
they be anointed and greased / and have received power off there Bishops to
sacrifice for the quick and the dead yet / I deny that oil and that power
off sacryfycing to be any sufficient warraunt for them / to be ministers off
the Gospel and off the Sacraments.

This is a profane oil / and can give no man authority to dispose the
mysteries off God. The ministers off God are anointed with an other kind off
oyntme^t which Christ him self made and prepared / sending out his Apostles
to preach the Gospel and to baptize those which should believe wherewithal
seeing they are not anointed why are they suffered to preach the Gospel with
profane mowthes / or to touch the holy mysteries with unclean and polluted
hands? Math. 28.^^.
But some man will say. They have received the laieing on off hands / and
were ordained as every man thowght then to minister the service off God.

I confess indede that hands were laid upon them neither do I much stand
upon yt what or whose hands they were / but I deny that ever they were chosen
to a lawful ministry / or that hands were laid upon them to this end: yea
rather contrary / they were laid on them for an end that is most contrary
to the ministry off the Gospel / so that by no means / this can be
accomp^ed the lawful office off a true Pastor: From whence they are as far
off / as the Priests off Israel who were appointed by Jeroboam to sacrifice to
the calves were from that lawful calling which the priests had which were at
Jerusalem: So that the same Ordring and institucion / can by no means serve
to give one man at the same time / twoe offices so diverse and contrary between
then se^ues. For thus all the offices / off all Kingdoms and common wealths
are distinguished the one from the other / and severed by the diverse ends they
are appointed unto.

Thus they are called Senators and Councellers / who are chosen to give
council: Judges / who are appointed to give judgment and such like. So
likewise in the church one is appointed for teaching: an other for disposing
the goods off the church: and every office is distinguyshed from other by the
form and manner off his creacion and calling. By which reason also the Apostle
to the Hebrews proves that the Priesthood off Chr^ste differs from the
Priesthood off the Law / for (says he) in these words The Lord swore and
will not repent, Hebr. 7.
thou art a priest for ever after the order off Melchiscdech. Christ is
ordained priest after the order off Mechisedeche: but the priests off the law
are ordained after an other order namely off Aaron: Christ / for ever: They
only for the small time off this short life: Christ / with an oath: They /
without any oath. whereby it appareth / that his priesthood is far other yea
much more noblea^d excellent the^ theirs was. Which axacte manner off disputing
of the Apostle if we follow / and compare the institucion off true a
ministers which is contained in these words off our savior Christ Proach the
Gospel and baptize those which believe / with the orders off the popish
priests whereby they are ordained to sacrifice for the quick and the dead /
Shall yt not appear more clear then the light / that these twoe offices are
not only diverse / but clean contrary the one to the other. For what Agreement
is there between a Pastor and a Priest between the Gospel and a Sacrifice /
or rather what may be more contrary to the preaching off the Gospel then
this new sacrifice off the mass / for the quick and the dead. The preaching
off the Gospel in deed is a sweet savor unto god: and surely / a very
acceptable sacrifice is yt unto him when as the ministers off his gospel slay
our old man as a sacrifice with the sharp edged sword off his word: neither
can any oblacion more please him the^ when that the co^cupisce^ces and
affections off our flesh being mortified and killed we are offered upon his
altar: but it is so fare off that any sin should be taken away by this
sacrifice / that as much as we give unto yt in this behalf / so much we
detracte from the true sacrifice off our only priest Jesus Christ. But say
they / the supper off the Lord is meant by this sacrifice / and so by that the
whole ministry. Some Papist indeed may say thus that vaunteth the mass
for the Lords supper: but we who according unto gods word / rest our selves
in the only sacrifice off Christ / and casting all other hope aside / fly
from the wrath off god unto the only altar off the cross off Christ. Let us
confess as we believe / that there is nothing more contrary to that holy supper
/ then there Idolatrous mass and nothing more against the commemoracion off
the death off Christ / then this new altar which they have erected against
the altar off Christ. Seeing then there is so great contrariety and not
difference alone between the offices and between the things whereunto they are
appointed / It is plain and manifest that no man by the same ceremony and order
/ can be assigned to the bearing off two offices so contrary in themselves.
And that popish Priests are not to be suffered to serve the church off God
without a new examinacion approbacion / election / and calling. How and when
they are to be admitted / yt shall after he declared / where occasion shall
serve to speak off putting back from the mynisterie such as be nouices in
the faith.

But I have tarried to long in this point off popish Priests: now there
folleweth to add somewhat in this place / touching women and midwiues / who
without any commandment of God / or rather contrary to his express word take
upon the^ that part off the office off the minister To baptize children / in
case off danger off there lives and of dying without baptism otherwise. which
notwithstanding I would suppose not needful to be done / the error being so
absurd and manifest / yff we had yet learned after so many years wherein by the
great goodness off God / his holy word is freely and sincerely preached
unto us / what were the force off our Adoption in Christ: what were the
strength off the couenannte which God made with us: what the eternal and
everlasting council off god in Christ were touching our saluacon: what were
the use off the Sacraments / and namely off Baptism. For who can dowbte that
this foul error flowed into the church from these heads? and that the
ignorance off these things was the cause that some not understanding that
place off Saint John / John 3.5
Unless a man be borne again off water and off the Spirit. He cannot enter
into the Kingdom off God, took occasion thereoff to think Baptism
necessary to salvation / and that all that were not baptized should be
condemned. Whereas all the Scripture / (to the Anal^ogie and proporcion
whereoff this place is to be expounded) p^ainly teaches / that the Elect are
saved by the good pleasure and will off god / by reason off the couenante /
and off there Adoption in Ihesus Christ: Ephesians. 1.5.
That Abraham was iustefied before his circuncision (which in force and effect
answers to our baptism) and that couenaunce and the promises are not made by
the sacraments / but sealed by the^. Romans 4.11.
Which seal also / serves not to the confyrmyng off the word off god in it
self / which in yt se^fe is most constaunte / certain and immutable / and
has no need to borowe credit off any thing else / but that i^ may be
confirmed in us / whose weakness to the fulie staieng and acquieting off our
faith / neded such means to be confirmed by.

So that seeing the lord to have sete his sygnet to the confyrming off our
Salvation / and to have sealed yt up / we might the more quietly rest and
acquiete our selves in his faith and custody. As for the place off S. John /
wither yt be to be understood off the holy Ghost the Author off this
regeneracion whereoff our Savior speaks (who as in an other place is meant by
fire / so may be also here by water) or whither yt be meant off Baptism / yt /
in no wise restrains our salvation to every sprinckling off wa^er but to the
sacrament only. But there can be no sacrament without a minister and there can
be no embassadge without an ambassador.

And if any private man should break bread according to the institucon off
Christ / and communicate with others to the commemoracion off his Seathe / who
would call that the ho^y supper off the Lord / and not rather an unworthy
prophanacion off that most holy mynister / rye? And yet although yt be
ministered by a minister / our entrance into the kingdom off god is not to be
given to the outward baptism / but in as much / as by a sacramental kind of
speaking usual in the scriptures in this kind / That is attributed to the
Sacraments / for the certain conjunction off the things signified with the /
Signs / which indede is proper to the things whereoff they be Sacraments.

Therefore there is not that necessytie off Baptism to salvation which many
do suppose / that for this cause the holy ordinance off god whereby it is
lawful for the mynisters only to minister the Sacraments / should be
profaned. And I can not see / what other cause off his prophanacion they can
pretend. And a man may mervailee why at such times / they pu^ not rather
private men to baptize then women for sure the fault had been so much the
less. For women are further removed from this office / for whom yt is
unlawful to take the same upon them not only because they are preuate / but
also because they are women. 1. T^moth. 2.11.12.
For even the very sex is forbidden to exercise any public charge or
function in the church by sancte Paull. And is commanded to sit still and be
quiette: which quietness and vocation these men will not suffer the^ to enioie /
who stir them up / to the exercisyng off authority and doing off these
things so expresselie forbidden them.

But yff this were to be suffered / for that necessity which they imagine /
why should yt not also be suffered in case off like necessity / that they
should minister the lords supper and preach the gospel? wherefore seeing they
are forbidden by S. Paul. to exercise any ecclesiastical function or
authority / Seeing it is an unlawful transgression off the ordinance off
Christ and an unworthy prophanacion off baptism to give leave to women and
mydwiues to exercise this authority / it were to be wished / that some part
off the mydwiues conning were practiced here to the vnburdening of our church
off this foul error as off a shameful monster that yt trauaileth withal and
that it were ordained (which the Lord has commanded) that they who are not
chosen nor by any means can be chosen to goo on the Lords embassadge / should
not abuse any longer the place / office / and authority off so wo^thy a
calling.

It remains now to enquire off Archedeacons / chancellors / commissaries /
and the rest off that sort who without any grownde off the word off god take
upon them authority ^o Judge off all such causes as belong to the Assembly
off Elders to Judge off and to govern the chur(+che: and to correct and
punyshe not only the people but even the ministers them selves according to
there will and pleasure. who / I know not what answer they can be able to
make for them selves / what letters off Order they can show: what signs and
seals off there Vocacion: whereas the holy scrip^ures do not only commytie
no such charge unto them / but makes not a word mention off all this sort
at all. For in all the Testament wherein our Savior has declared his last will
unto us / and appointed Tutors and Gardianes for his church / There is not one
word mencyoned off the Tutorshippe off these men / but off Apostles /
Prophets / and Evangelists who for a certain time should have the charge off
yt: After also off Pastors / Doctors / and Elders / to whom this office was
committed for ever.

To usurp then without the will off so worthy a Testator not only some part
off this charge (which notwithstanding could not be done without the breaking
off the Testament) but even the the whole / and that by displacing those who
were lawfully called thereunto / and subiecting them to the usurped authority
/ and so to break into an other man's possession that thou not only put out
the right owner and master / but also compel him to become subject and slave
to the / has not only no pretense off right and equity / but being so heinous
and unworthy a fact / were worthy to be corrected by the Magistrates
authority. For what a confusion is this / that the deacon leaving his proper
charge off the poor / should take upon him an other man's / and rule / not
only the church / but also the Pastors / Doctors / and Elders to whom by
gods commandment he owght to be subject. And that every Canonise and
Petifogger in the law should usurp the Authority off Ministers and deuines.
I pass over that the most off them be Papists / and that such are suffered to
sit in the stearne who should no be suffered to sit upon the pomp / let
this be the fault off men and not off the laws / I speak off the thing yt
self. But some man will say / that the Bishop has this power by the word
off God: And they have yt off the Bishop / whose office and authority in
this behalffe they execute.

What the Bishops power is / and that the authority which he has / is
common also with him to the Pastors and Elders / and has no proper nor
peculiar authority in this point / we shall after see in dew place.

But let us put the case / that only the Bishop had this power and authority
granted to him to govern his own church according to Gods word: Is yt
therefore lawful for him to sit yd^e and dreamyng at home and let an other
do his off^ce abroad? But admite also that yt were lawful for him to have
an other to do his office: yet yt is not lawful for him to substitute whom
he lists in his place / but only some other man in the same degree that he is
/ of and that is in equal place and authority with him. For neither in old
time could the Consulles off Rome leave any man to do there office for them
but only such as were off the Consulles state and dignity: Nor now adays can
the maire off a town leave any Burgess to execute his office for him / but
only an Aldermen and one off the same degree and company. How much more
unmeet is it to trust any man with the keys off the house off David / but
only such to whom the Son and Heir who is set over the government off the
house / has commanded to deliver them.

For how greatly is it to be feared / lest that they oppen and shut they
care not how / and order all things not according to the Son and Heirs
commandment / but there own will and pleasure: How greatly I say is it to
be feared / lest they cast the lords Jewels before swine: lest they set
open his holy mysteries to be abused by every one: Lest they receive and
enterteine stranngers / and put out and refuse the^ off the household: finally:
Lest they profane and abuse all that they take in hand? And suerlie
experience teaches us how greatly they have erred who have put the^ in trust
with the kepi^g of so weighty things. For we have often times seen and truly
do see these things to happen which I have spoken off / that some off this
court for a grote or some small dewtie will excommunicate and as it were
banyshe out off heaven the most honest citezens off the kingdom off God / and
Curse them and cast them headlong into Hell: And conterwise / account off
enemies often times as off free men and cytezens / and suffer them to be
partakers off all the freedoms and liberties off the city off god. For it
comes to pass with them as with the hirelinges off whom our Savior Christ
speaks in the tenth off John: who because they do not there own office but
an other man's / care not how faithfully nor with what credit they use the^
selves / but rule and order all things / for there own commodity and pleasure.

But hereoff I trust we shall speak more at large hereafter. Now to go
forward / Let us admit both: That the Bishop has this authority / and
that he may appointe whom he list to excute it for him: yet how can we
think it lawful that a man should be admitted to ordinary and perpetual
office in the church / without a right and lawful calling (which as after
shall be declared / consists in these twoe points / first / that he be chosen
/ and after that he be ordained) seeing it is general / and belongs unto all
/ without exception who do bare any office in the church / which I laid in
the beginning as the foundation off all this disputacion / that is to say that
no man take this honor unto him but he that is called vnyt as was Aaron?

But seeing Archdeacons and Channcellors are appointed only by the Bishops
pleasure / and the other vnder-officiers by there is / and seeing that nothing is
used in the apointing off them which shall be showed to be necessary in the
calling to any eccleasticall function / Seeing there is no Election / no prayers
/ no Ordeining / no laiing on off hands and such life as both are wont and
owght to be used in such a matter / naie seeing there is not so much as an oath
given them without the which no office off any wait in the common wealth is
committed to any man: It must needs be confessed as the thing it self
declares / and I have proved by sure and undoubted arguments / That all this
rabble and company exercise authority in the church off God without any
lawful vocacion at all or calling. Wherefore seeing so many voluntary officers
have without any lawful calling taken upon them the government off the church
/ whereby as I have showed the wrath off god is most grievously provoked against
us / why do we not fiftene years after that by the grace off God his holy
Gospel is preached amongst us / why do we not I say in the ecclesiastical
officers that which the Romans did every five years in all degrees / that is
to say / why do we not make a search and assaie off every man's calling /
That Right and lawful authorie being discerned from that which is unjust and
unlawful / those impudent officers who were chosen by them selves or crepte in
at the back door / and were not called thereunto by the authority off God and
off his church / may be compelled to leave there places / and be put out off
office.

Therefore let inquiry be made into every man's calling / Let them show how
they were chosen and ordained as the leters and seal off there calling / let
them rehearse there genealogies and the race off there descente / let them
bring there rods and set them before the Arcke off God And they who cannot
show the marks and tokens off there Creacio^ and Election / They that cannot
fetch there Pedigree from Aaaron / and whose rods remain dead before the
Arcke / and neither blossom nor florishe / let them by the most just
authority off the word off God be displaced and put out off those offices
which they most unjustly and wrongfully have desired and usurped And thus
much may be sufficient to prove the necessitye off a lawful vocacion and
calling.

Now let us see the / use / fruit / and com^oditie off the same: which seems
to me to be so great / that although there were no punishment for the
neglecte and contempt off yt / yet yt were to be tarried and waited for / for
the marvelous use and commodity that yt brings with yt. For what can so
strengthen a man against all dangers which hang over him (discharging his
dewtie faithfully) as the remembrance that he is placed in that standing by
the commandment and authority off god / which as it places him / so it will
be always ready to defend him against the enmyties and lieng in wait off all
men. For then only the conscience is not afraid off any wind or weather / off
any storm or tempest / when as it staieth yt self upon the lord / and
follows him in that way / wheren he goes before.

Furthermore / they that are governed / can by no means better be browght to
do there dewtie and persuaded to do that which they owght / then when they
understand that it is the lords will and commandment whose ambassador the
mynister is. For they reverence only that authority which they know to be off
god, hereoff we have a manifest example in David / whom it stayed ofte^time
being ready to fall / and oftentimes also raised up again being beaten down
to the ground / that he came not to the kingdom by his own ambicion / as his
enemies falselie blamed him / but by the authority off god who called him /
and off Samuel the Prophet who by the Lords commandment had anointed him
The majesty and authority off which creacion at the last so moved all Israel
that is to say the ten tribes which for the space off seven years were not
obedient unto him / that they received him willingly for there king / whom
before they had disdained. For this cause also S. Paul so diligently almost
in the beginning off every Epistle calls him self an Apostle and seruante
off God.

For this cause also he takes so great pains in his Epistles to the the
Corinthes to prove his Apostleshippe / which some false brethren sowght to take
from him / that by that means they might dyminishe his credit and authority
with the church. Neither in deed was he more confirmed by any thing in his
infinite perilles / trobles and labors which he bare for the Gospells cause /
then that he assured him self off the aid and assistaunce off God in the
discharge off that dewtie unto which he was appointed by him. Which great
fruit and commodity if it may move us / let us tarry and wait for the
Voice of God to call us to bear office in his church and let us first be
assured most plainly and manifestly / that we are called thereunto by his
government and authority / Lest that having entered in by the back door / we
find the lord / to be punisher and Auenger off this ambycion / the people
disobedient and untoward / and our own consciences shaking and trembling /
not only at great and vndowbted dangers / but at every bugge / and at the
shaking off every leaf. Therefore the authority off God is to be waited for
to the taking in hand or bearing off any ecclesiastical office / and so to be
waited for / that we ambiciouslie seek yt not by any disceitfull or dishonest
means. And let no man boast here off his gifts and worthynes and in
confidence thereof as a suter seek and labor for honor. For How fytte soever
he seems to be for any charge and office / yet no thing is here to be taken
rashelie in hand / without the authority off God who will use in his affairs
/ whom it pleases him.

Judges 13.5.
It is rehearsed in the holy history off the judges off what a meruoulons
strength / and mete for a Prince / Sampson was: yet notwithstanding if he had
not been borne the Nazarite off the Lord / and chosen and appointed from his
Mothers womb to deliver the people / he owght not to have sowght vengeance
off the Philistines / or to have delivered his own country from there power /
and government / but rather / to have excercised that great strength and
might / as Arrius writes that Philoctetes bestowed his darts upon birds /
and not upon his armed enemies. Neither had it been lawful for Solomon to have
taken in hand the government off the kingdom off Israel / to put in practice
that excellent and worthy gift off wisdom and government in yt / except the
Lord had first chosen him to succeed in the princely throne off his father
David / and the administracion his his kingdom.

And worthelie were Absalon and Adoniah rejected who thinking them selves
worthy took that honor unto them: that he who was chosen by the Lord / and
thought worthy by him / might rule and govern. As also was Core in the like
case / and the rest off his faction: And after also king Vzziah desyring honors
and places / besides the good will and pleasure off God. For the Lord knows
how to rule his family / and whateuerie man is to be put in trust withal
according to that honesty and credit that he knows every one to be off. So
that he that rests not in his judgment / but would have and seeks by all
means to procure unto him self more then the Lord has given him / must
needs accuse him off folishenes or off malice / and therefore be guilty off most
grievous and haynons sin.

And let them not obiecte against us that saying off the Apostell that He that
desires the office off a Bishop desires a good thing, 1. Timoth. 1.3.
to prove and confirm this ambicious sewing and laboring for the ministry /
whereas yt is so far off that these words should kindle and inflame us
hereunto / that contrariwise the Apostle seems by these words to have sowght
to bridle our hasty desire. For whereas the Apostle says / that the office
off a Bishop is a worthy work / to what end / think we does he call yt
so / but therewithal to admonish us how hard yt is / and that it requires a
man both off singular learning and godliness. For so yt follows that Bishop
owght to be off an honest and blameles life / sober / temperate liberal / meke
/ apt to teach / and so forth. 2. Corinthians. 2.16.
And this is the worthiness off the off ce off a Bishop which the Apostle
shows in this place / and which he so meruaileth at in other places / that he
thincketh no man mete to take so great a charge upon him.

By which dignity and worthiness off the office / the Ambicion off men is
rather quenched then kindled: For understanding thereby / how great and
weighty a calcalling it is / we are warned to take heed that we run^e not
rashelie to it / but rather that we prepare our selves long before with all
study care and diligence for the bearing off so great a burden. As for the
word (...) which signifies to couette or desire / yt is ill alleged for the
proof off any ambicious seking off the mynisterie. Whereas the Apostle
understands a godly zeal to set furthe the glory off god and to edify his
church / which wishes and desires indeed to be made able once by the grace
off God / to serve him and his church in that calling: which meditateth and
thinks daily hereupo^ / and exercises and prepares him self thereunto /
bestowyng wholly all study and labor to that end / yet notwithstanding
waits for the voice off God / and authority off the church to call him /
and by an unripe and headie desire / or ambicious kind off hastines /
preuenteth not the time off his calling.

We read that Christ our Savior him self / although he were endewed with
all heavenly wisdom / yet lay he hid as yt were (without exercising any
public office) to the thyrtie year off his age / and tarried for that voice of
his father / whereby being declared the Beloved son of God in whom only the
father was well pleased / he might be sent out to go off his embassage* Luke
3.23. Math. 3.17.
he had disputed indeed once before with the Doctors in the Temple: but that
was no full execucio^ off any public office / Luk 2.49.
but as yt were a certain florishe and plaieng at wasters whereby / he
prepared him self / unto a full combat and a greater battle. Math. 28.19.
Likewise did the Apostles who did not thrust them selves in to the church /
without his co^manmandement and apointment / but waited for that voice / Go /
preach the Gospel and baptize those which believe.

The same modesty appeared in the Bishops of the primitive church / so long
as it co^tinewed uncorrupted and in good estate / for after / as they were not
afraid to enter into the church by fraud and doceyte / so being once entered
in / they behaved them selves in yt with like faithfullnes and modesty / that
they entered in. why do we not therefore bridle this posting and spurring for
the mynisterie and contenting our selves with the godly and zealous desire off
our mind and our labor and study to prepare our selves thereunto / flee and
avoid this shameful ambicion.

These so notable and worthy examples let us esteem as a law made against
Ambicion: which yff we shall be so bold as to transgress / let us assure our
selves that one day / in a most solemn court and assembly we shall be
charged with Ambicion.

Neither only in the office off a Bishop / but in all other Ecclesiastical
charges this woyng off places and offices / owght to be esteemed vnmette and
unworthy / for the modesty off any Christian man: and how much better were
yt / to send back again this laboring for offices and sutorlike care unto
Rome / from whence yt came.

For as much then as great fruit is lost by this ambicious seking for
offices and honor / which they reap who are fully persuaded off there calling
and off the will off God appointing them thereunto / Seeing also the examples
off our Savior Christ / off his Apostles / off the purer and primitive church
/ do call us from yt and exhortethe us to all sobernes and modesty / and that
hereby great wrong is done unto God / whose authority is not waited for / and
that both the Lords ordinance and our own proffitte and commodity calls
us back from this hunting after places and and offices / Let us at the length
amend the custom which we have: that to come flocking from all parts to that
place where orders (as we call them by a popish name) are given by the
bishop to seek and sewe for them / to bring letters off Lords or Justices or
some other off our friends in our commendacion and favor.

Finally Let us amend whatsoever yt is / whereby a lawful calling may be
corrupted and stained and now at the Length (which we owght to have done long
ago) Let us decree according to the word off God / that no man hereafter sewe
for any calling in the church. Let every man more shamefastlie and modestly
offer his labor and diligence / Let all men keep them / selves at home and
there abide and wait for the voice off God and authority off those who are
chosers to the taking upon him off any ecclesiastical charge or function.
There do yet remain certain things to be spooken off ecclesiastical
officers touching the execucion off that office whereunto they be called.

Off which the first is that the vocacion wandre not freely where it listethe
but be joined with a charge off some certain place and church. For yt is not
here as yt is in the profession off the arts / that we should esteem these
orders as certain commendacions / and the churches allowinge off any man's
worthiness / as it is in them that by the Judgment and authority off the
universities are preferred to the profession off the liberal sciences / or off
the cyuall law or physic or any other such like.

For they have none appointed them whom they should teach or heal or give
counsel unto / or where they should exercise there profession / but as they see
it commodious for them selves go to those places which they thinck fyttest for
them / or if they thinck good sit idle at home: But the ministers apointement
ought not to be such / that having received as it were the commendacion and
allowance of learned men / they should after provide a place for them selves as
they thought most commodious / or else sit idle all there life time at vome if
they list.

For these admissions and allowances off students are given unto the^ as honors
and rewards which have no more labor hanginge upon the^ then they list and
judge to be profitable for them. But these honors are such / that men are
rather chareged then preferred by them: and indeed rather to be esteemed
burdens then honors / whose nature is such that as gardaynshipppz are
granted not for his cause who is chosen but rather for theirs who have need
off their care help and labor: So that if there be no such in the church)
there is no cause off apointinge any to ecclesiastical charges.

Therefore the Apostles did at no time appoint mynisters or deacons that
afterward should provide them selves churches where they should teach / or
whose treasury they should ouersee or else be idle if they would / but they
ordained deacons Pastors and Elders as the necessytie off the church did
require. Thus we reed in the sixth off the Acts that when the state off the
church off Jerusalem did require / the Apostles ordained deacons over the
treasury off that church / to see the orderinge off it and the provision for
widows and pore folks. Thus also Paul and Barnabas in the xiiij. off the
acts ordained elders in every church: Acts 14.23.
and neither left the churches as orphans with out any to care and provide
for them / neither appointed any elders but unto such certain chuches as had
need off them. So also Saint Paul expressly commands Titus whom he hade
left in Crete / to set the churches in order / that he should appoint Elders in
every city that is to say / where there was any church or number off those that
believed. Titus 1.5.


And for this same cause I thinck there is scarcely any where in the holy
scriptures mention made off Elders and Deacous / where together with all is not
mentioned the name off the church / place or city where in they did exercise
there office. Thus Paul in the Epistle to the Philippians makes mention off
there Bishops and Deacons. (...) 1.


Thus also also Saint Luke writethe in the Acts Saint Paul sent for the
Elders off Ephesus / and that the church off Antioche sent unto the Aoostles
and Elders at Jerusalem about the question off Circumcision. Act. 20.17.
Act. 15.2.


And also in Saint Peter writing to the churches wchich were scattered in
Pontus and Galatia in the fifte chapter / I exhort says he the Elders which are among you: 2. Epist. Peter 5.1.
that is to say the Elders which are set over your several churches.

And in the same place he commends also unto the Elders the flocks which are
among them / that is to say to every one off them there own flocks: whereby
yt may appear that they were set over certain flocks.

And these be not only the examples off the Apostles / but the laws which they
give us / and the commandementes which they left us / to ordeyne Elders and
Deacous in the church as the necessity and state theroff shall require. And
sure I cannot tell how he can thinck him sellfe to have receyned any office who
with out doing any man wrong may sit idle if he list. Offten times the
ancient Sinodes made decrees against these idle orders that leave a man so free
/ bindinge him to no certain charge.

That no man should be ordained an elder (as they use to speak yt) without a
title / that is to say without a church. And suerly if all were not confused
and trobled in the Discipline off our church we could never bear so notable
disorder / that such kind off allowinges should be esteemed lawful
ministeries: which are then only Mynisteries off the church when they that are
thus commended and allowed off have gotten a church that will use there labor /
and who in the mean time either do nothing / or else go about as they lift
in all the realm as roges and masterles servants seekinge some master that
will hyre them and use there Labor.

Such times in deed ar spoken off in the stories off the Judges / where
Jonathan the Leuite wantinge a high place and an altar went rouinge to let
out his service to any that would hyre him: but it is added in the same place
that there was then no king in Israel.

But this great confusion was taken away afterward by David and Solomon / and
every one according to the ancient prescripcion off Moses and Iosus / were
appointed there proper seats towns and cynes ^o occupy them in.

Therefore why do we that live under the kingdom off CHRIST our true Solomon
who has set all this in very Good order / why do we I say suffer the church
to be stained with so notable a spott and ordeyne not according to the word
off God / that no no man be appointed to any Ecclesiastical office / But he,
Iosue 22.
that is called to a certain church where to to exercise it? And why do we not
according to this example call home the Priests to the Arcke off the Lord and
the levites to the appointed cities? There remains somewhat that lickwise
pertains to all that bear office in the church. That is / that they so
execute them / that they may not be accused for neglectinge or pretermitinge
there duties.

For in the church / what so small a charge is there which we ought not to
study with all faithfulness / labor / and diligence to make florishe to
beautify and adorn: saying we have the Angels for lookers on to see how we
use and behave our selves in the execucion theroff / and the Lord him self a
most liberal rewarder off the one part yff we do it well / and contrariwise a
most severe Judge and Auenger if we do it not according to our duty. For
that which the Apostle co^mandethe to give Archippus warrninge off / That he
should diligently see to his office which he had received off the Lord is to be
extended also to all those that bear any charge or office in the church off God
/ and every one ought to think it to perteine to them selves / which the same
Apostle admonishes Tymothie off / that is / That they discharge there duty and
make known there ministry by all means. Coloss. 4.17.
2. Timoth. 4.5.
yea further / all that are called to any office or government in the church /
must understand that the same hang / he over there headdes / which the Apostle
declares that he was afraid off if (being called thereunto) he should not
preach the Gospel. 2. Cor. 9.16.
For there is none so little a charge in the house off god / wheroff one day most
straight Account shall not be asked.

In vayn then shall men dream off pardons / dispensacions and privileges: All
shall be called to Account to declare with what faithfulness and diligence they
have done there duties: They shall be ^e compelled to answer there most deadly
enemies / that off them selves shall be ready to accuse them for not having
discharged there duty And the account shall be made in the greatest and most
solemn assemble that ever was / for seeing that it appear the by the parable
off the tale^tes com^itted to the servants that a most straight account shall be
asked off the lest gift off god that we receyne in this world how much
streighter do we thinck it will be for the^ that have receeyued government in the
church / and if he shall be so hardly dealt with that neglects one tale^t that
he has received: They that bear greatest offices in the church / and upon
whose faith and credit in discharging off them / the salvation theroff does in
a manner depend / how carefully ought they both day and night to thinck off
dischardging this dewty / having so great a reckoninge to make / not off one
Talent but off the church which our Lord Jesus so dearly loved / that for
love theroff. Ephe. 4.9.
he vouchsafed to come from the highest heavens into these lower parts off the
earth to redeem it and purchase it not with gold or silver / as says Saint
Peter but with his precious bludd. 1. Pet. 1.18.19.


But I do otherwise then I was purposed: that am fallen to threatninges and
exhortacions / whereas in the beginning I only purposed to declare what ought
to be done and what we do not. And yet there be so great faults committed in
this behalff / that it seemuch nothing can be grievously and vehemently enoughe
spoken against them. (For the chief charges off the church are not only left
vndischarged for negligence / but dispensacions and privileges are granted /
that exempt ministers from the necessary doing off there dewty / and give
Pastors leave off this condition to leave there flock and there churches / yff
they leave an other in there place to read service unto them.

And for them that will go to the university / by an ordinary law / it is
lawful to be absent three years and the realt with a little money may purchase
the like dispensacions in the Archbishops court and market. Off the sa^e sort
also be those bulls / that are bought in the same market that give ycence off
heaping so many churches or as they call them. Beneficies to gether, which
Faculties (as they call them besides the intolerable covetousness (where with
also for some men's diligence in this behalffe is joined extreme need and
poverty off a great number off other as commonly it comes to pass where a
few men rake all unto them selves) bring in also into the church a
necessity off neglectinge off dewty / saying yt is impossible that one should
be able to serve more churches and those often times / the lenght off the whole
land a sonder. In which horrible destroyinge off the church and neglectinge
and for sakinge the Lords flock streyinge in the mountains and wandringe in
the woods with out a guide (which he him self spared not to spend his life
for to bring yt into the way again) we are in no part inferior to the Papists
them selves.

Is this then our discipline? is this that order (which some men often times
praisinge in words desire nothing less in deed) Is this the government and
administracion off our church / and yet no man may be suffered freely to speak
for the reformacio^ of the church and restoringe again of the pure and perfect
government of the Apostles? Saying these are most manifestly contrary to the
example off our Savior Christ and off the Apostles / Saying they threaten the
certain ruin and over throw off the church / Saying they do not only shake
but turn upward the pillars off the same / Have we not Good cause to be moved
both for the Glory off God and the salvation of the church / to require more
holy ordinances and a better government off the same? Can any man esteem
these light matters and off small weight? that the sacred Laws off God are
openly violated and broken with out any shame / that the church which Christ
has redeemed with his bludd is neglected / That there is no regard had off
discharginge off duties / That a man takes to him self which the Aungelles
dare not / and that the Archbishopp dare give the Pastor leave contrary to the
express commandment off God / to forsake his flock / or grant him such
privileges wheroff that same does necessaryly follow) which no Archangell may
challendge to him selff? Or shall those things also which I have handled from
the beginning to this place be esteemed small faults? to ground
Ecclesiastical discipline not upon the word off God and the will off the Lord
Jesus?

But off the canon law (Which suerly I doubt not to affirm to be the very
fountain and spring from whence all the rest off the Corruptions do flow)
that popish priests / women / Archdeacons / and Chauncelers with there
Officialles / Commissaryes and the rest off that Trashe / do bring there impure
hands and never sanctified unto God / to do his holy service / to preach his
word / to handle and distribute his facred mysteries / to order and govern his
church / And nothing sear any punishment off this there boldness and most
unworthy prophanacion off the holy offices? That Jonathan / the Levites
shameful example in seekinge a Master / or as we call yt / in gettinge the
good will off a Patron is taken to be followed? That David and Salomons
example in calling the Priests and Levites to there cities and towns / and
the Apostles in ordeininge no ecclesiastical officer but unto certain churches
/ is neglected and contemned. And last off all / that These wicked and
intolerable faculties / Prerogatives / Privileges / and dispensacions tha^ I
have spoken off at suffered in our church? Are all thee I say to be countid
trifles / or certain light faults and tolerable errors? For my par e suerly I
think as also I suppose all they will do that will were this by the word off
God as by the gold smythes balance) that there is never a one off these light
and small to be esteemed / but that they are all heinous trespasses / and
matters off Treason / to be examined and judged off in the highest courts.
Therefore in the name off God / let us not seek to bring this holy doctrine
off reforminge our discipline into hate and displeasur / under a show that yt
is a new / and a false pretense that all innouacio^s and cha^ges are dangerous
/ but rather abrogating these most unjust and unrighteous laws / dispensacions
/ and (as I may well call them) pardones and indulgencies / at the last / let
us call again that manner off gouerninge the church and that discipline (being
now lost) which the Lord him self by his ambassadors and Apostles has
appointed.

Thus having described and laid out the lawful vocacion off all those which
occupy any public place in the church / let us now come to the parts and
members of the same: which especially are two / wherein the right manner off
geuinge these offices does consist / that is In election and ordinacion: which
is so properly called. Election is the appointinge by the Elders the rest off
the church allowing it / off a fit man to the bearinge off some office in the
church. And as for Election that it is necessary to the geuinge off any off
these offices / it may appear even off that that S. Paul ioineth it with
examinacion and trial / and diligently warns Timothy that he lay not on his
hands upon them that be unworthy but only upon those that after a just trial
being had are found meet and chosen. 1. Timoth 3.10. 1. Timoth. ^.^2.
That same is proved also by the continual use off the Apostles who by the
judgment and authority off the church appointed Bishopps to teach / and
Deacons for the orderinge off the Treasury off the church. For Christ has not
chosen any certain house or famyly (as it was in old time under the law wherein
the government off the church should all wais remain. He gave herein no right
off Petigree / stock and blood / no ministers by inheritance but he would have
the judgment left free unto his church / and the offices theroff to be given
by choice and worthiness. Off which election for as much as it was so necessary
for the state off the church / that without yt the church it self could /
not long continue: Our Savior Christ was very careful / and therefore declared
particularly and distinctly all things which apperteined to the orderyng
theroff. For he has perfectly and diligently showed both who owght to choose
/ and to whom especially this care ought to belong / and what ought to be
followed / and regarded in chosinge off every one. For although this question
and controversy off the chosers has been diversely disputed off by learned men
/ yet almost all off them co^sen in this / that there must be more to deal
therein and that so great and so wayghtie a charge and belonginge to the
especial and singular commodytie or discomoditie off the wholl church ought
not be committed to the authority off any one but be ordered and ruled by the
judgment and consent off many.

And this is the general opynion off all those that ever disputed lernedly and
wisely in this cause: from which I thinck no man can dissent but the Papists
and they that have succeeded them in that authority which they most vnuistly
and not without open injury and tyranny do usurp. For the Bishopps that
challeng this power unto them selves by there mere authority and there own
only Judgment and advise to apoint the officers off the church / cannot
challenge this by any right or law off God / but exercise a very tyranny
though indeed long ago browght into the church / which lest I may seem to
have said with out cause / and to have condemned them with out hearing them to
say what they can / let them show forth / from whom and by what right this
infynit power and authority is come into there hands. yff they say they have
succeeded by inheritance unto the Apostles / and therefore have received yt off
them / allthoghe I should grant them the first / the second yet is disprouued
by most manifest testimonies and examples of the appostles them selves. For let
us see if ever the Apostles in any election did challendge this power and
authority unto them.

Saint Luke writes off three elections holden by the appostles / the first /
in the first off the Acts where a new Apostle is chosen. The second in the
sixth / where the Seacons: the third in the fourtenthe where the Elders ar
appointed in every church. For although the Apostles did not choose Matthias
But left it to the Lot which should declare the Lords will and counsel
therein / because this was proper and peculier for that office off Apostles /
that / they should not be chosen off men nor by men But immediately from the
Lord him self / yet in settinge forth two / there is a certene kind off choice
and election.

But what is there in all this actio^ / that either James whom some say to have
been Bishopp at Jerusalem or P^^er / or any off the other Apostles does take
unto him self? For although that Saint Luke declares that James was present
here / yet we read not that he was chief there or took upon him (as he was
Bishop) authority to appointe an Apostle / Or else those two / off whom one
should be chosen by the Lot / But contrawise we see that he challenged no more
to him self then either Andrew or Philipp / or any other off the rest off the
Apostles. In deed Peter as Proloquutor propoundethe all the matter and purteth
up as yt were this grace unto the church off chosinge an Apostle. And he him
self declares what one they ought to choose and what especially in there
election they ought to respect and regard.

But used no particular or special authority in choosinge / the word (...) They
set forth. Actet. 1.23.
Which is off the plural number used by Saint Luke in that place does
manyfestly declare and prove. Therefore in this first and solemn election off
the Apostles / there was nothing done or said / from whence this infynite power
and authority may be derived unto the Bishops: But contrariwise saying James
takes nothing to him selffe nor Peter nor any other off the rest / nay saying
all the Apostles togeether do nothing here off there own authority / nor
choose whom yt pleasethe them / It is sure and manifest / that That Bishopp
that will not take him self greater then an Apostle / or then all the Apostles
/ can by no right challendge to him selffe any such power or privilege in
gyuinge and apointinge the offices off the church.

But Let yt be that this election for the choice off Mathias and the great
office and calling whereunto he was chosen / had somewhat singular and
extraordinary and let us see the next / that is the election off the Seacons
written by Saint Luke in the sixthe chapter off the Acts wherein ik is so
far off that Peter or James or any other off the Apostles challenged any
thing above the rest unto them selves in choosinge off them / that
contrariwise there was nothing done but by the common consent and agreement off
them all. For Saint Luke does expressly declare that the multitude off the
disciples we called togeether by the twelve: that the choosinge off Seaco^s was
propounded by the twelve: and that the election being ended the prayers were
made and hands laid on by the twelve. For allthoughe they did not all call
them to geether / nor propounde the election nor make the prayers / yet so
express a speakinge as Saint Luke uses here / That the twelve called the
disciples together, and the words off the plural nombre which he uses in
every place off this history do manyfestly prove that nothing was done here by
the private commandment or counsel off any / but that contrariwise all
things passed by the com^on consent and authority off all the Apostles
Therefore in this second and most solemn election both for the presence off
all the Apostles and multitude off the disciples / They take the repulse again
and can not obtain this immesurable and princely authority in the church
which they seek to have.

The last is the election off Elders written in the fourtenth off the Acts
which was heeld not by all the Apostles but only by Paul and Burnabas. wherein
although they two ruled all the actio^ and did moderate and govern the
Judgment off those that gave the voices / yet that they used no power and
authority off there own in electinge the Elders off the church even that one
word (...) (Chosinge by liftinge up off the hands off the people) does
manyfestly declare. Therefore the Bishopps received not this authority by
inheritance from the Apostles whose elections I have declared to have been
furthest off from this lordly authority. For so they had been taught off
Christ that his kingdom was notlike the kingdoms off this world / wherein some
one has the chief authority / to whom the rest ought to obey and whom they
call there Lord an master. Math ^0.2^.26.27.
But he had appointed ^oir greatest or greater then his fellows / they had
learned that he was only king / to whom all ought to be obedient / and that they
ought to live togeether like fellows in equal place and degree one with an
other.

But they flee from the Apostles to the Eua^gelistes And that favor they could
not get off the Apostles / they hope to atteyne by them: therefore they fetch
the beginning off this power and authority from Tymothie and Titus / loff
whom they say the one was bishop at Ephesus and the other in Candy. And
Timothy (say they) was commanded that he should not lay on his hands to
rashly upon any: 2. Timothe. 45.
which commandment had bin in vain if the election off ministers had not
been in the Bishopps hands. But I ask them how they prove that Tymothe was
bishop at Ephesus: For I thinck they will not bring me that subscriptio^ To
Tymothe first chosen bishop off Ephesus, In the subscription of the second
epistle to Timothe.
much less Eusebius authorite) the Author wheroff is unknown and off no great
credit which also is not set at the end off the first epistle against the most
manifest testimoni off the Scripture which callethe Tymothie not a Bishop but
an Evangelist for so Saint Paul expressly calls him in the end off his
second epistle unto him: 2. Timoth. 45. Act. 16.17.18.19.20. Act. 19.22.20.4.
2. Corint. 3.11. Romans 16.21.
And the whole history prouethe that it cannot be that he could have tarried
long at Ephesus / who followed Paul trauelinge through so many churches and
served him in his iourny / whom Paul himself does witness in mani places to
have been an eye witness off his afflictions whom he sent some times to
Ephesus / namely when he went into Macedonia / sometimes to Corinth /
witnessinge that he did the lords worck / even as he him self / As also to
the Romans he calls him his follow laborer / as one that labored to gee^her her
with him in plantynge and orderinge off churches. 2. Timoth. 4.11.
and last ^ff all that there may be no way to escape In the end off the same
Epistle wherein he is called a Bishop / he sendethe for him from Ephesus to Rome
/ which suerly he would never have done yff he had been appointed Bishopp there
/ or one off those elders whom Paul in the twentieth off the Acts sent for to
miletum and exhorts to contynuall watch and ward. And Paul him self
writes that he willed him to tarry at Ephesus / not that he had ordained him
bishopp there. 1. Tim. 1.3.


A like objection they make out off the Epistle to Titus where it is written
that Paul left him in Creta that he should appoint Elders in every town.
Titus 1.5.


But it may lickwise be annswered that the Apostle says not that he ordeineth
him Bishopp off the churches off Creta / But only that he leaft him in Creta:
namely so long until he had set such things in order / as Paul being
otherwise called away could not tarry to do / and had appointed Elders in every
city: which apperethe by this that he commanded him when those things were done
to come to him to Nicopolis into Macedonia. Lickwise in an other place he
writes that Titus was gonn into Dalmacia: 3. Tit. 3.12.
so that yt is clear enoughe that Titus had no charge off any certain place or
church. 2. Timo. 4.10.
Therefore seeing I thinck yt is sufficiently proved that Titus and Tymothie were
Eua^gelistes and not Bishops / how does that make for the Bishops which we
see by there Epistles was granted unto the^. For I thinck they will not compare
them selves with the Evangelists or affirm them selves to be off equal
authority with them: which if they should / they might be easelie confuted as
after in dew place shall be declared.

But that we may put the case that Timothy was Bishopp at Ephesus / and that
we may freely grant that what so ever may apperre to have been lawful for
him / to be lawful also for them: Let us see now what the Apostle granted to
Timothy. For soothe say they that he might choose off his own authority the
officers off the church. Let us then see whether it be so or not. And here is
first to be noted that they do ill give that unto Election which perteyneth not
to Election But to Ordinacion. For the laying on off hands was not wont to be
used in choosinge off any Officers off the church / But in ordeininge off him.

Then that we grant them this also / That election hereby is signified / I say
that there Tyranny and Lordly authority is by no place more confuted then by
this which they bring for them selves / which that yt may more clearly appear
I must first take away a certain false exposicion which they bring off this
place / that after I may the more easyly convince them by the true and natural
meaning theroff.

Here say they Tymothie is warned that he lay not his hands to hastily upon
any nor communicate with other men's faults / namely with there is say they / who
allthoughe they be unworthy / seek to enter into the ministry. An
interpretacion very vnfytt either for the words off the Apostle or for those
times. Will they confess that even in those times this ambicion had crept into
the church / that as now a days so then also they went unto the Bishop for
order and layinge on off hands? for otherwise / what other men^s fault is this
/ wherewith the Apostle warn the Tymothi that he pollute not him self? for
what fault can this be. Not to be fit to taky upon him an ecclesiastical
function. But herein is the fault / that he that is guilty to him self off his
own unworthiness / desirethe notwithstanding to take that upon him which he is
not able to be are with out great offense.

But who will say that so shamfull Ambicion reigned in the church in those
days / which many years after was borne and brought up at Rome? And if the
church had then been steyned with this blott / would not Paul expressly have
forbidden this Ambition? saying that he would have a bishop to be blamles and
provided by all means that he should not swell and wax proud / Therefore this
is off smaller weight then it may be allowed and the meaning off this place is
far otherwise. nam y this: That Paul foreseyng long before that grievous
wolves not sparing the flock would rise up even off the Elders off Ephesus them
selves / and that Tymothie was but off equal authority with the Elders in
gouerninge off the church and choosinge off others into the same place and
degree / and that they that were such would choose to b^ Elders / and lay there
hands on such as were like them selves / he warns Timothy that he do nothing
rashely in this behalffe / neither if any such thing happen although other
like never so well off it / yet he shall not suffer him self to be led away by
there authority to the allowynge off it / but if he could not keep others by
his counsel from so doing / at the least he should keep him selff pure and
innocent for so he adds emphatically. Keep thy self pure and communicate not
with other men's faults.

And this is the true and natural meaning off this place / where by yt
appears that the Apostle not only grauntith him no princely authority / for
then he would not have warned him to keep him self pure from allowynge any
such Election / but have commanded him off his mere authority to have
hindered and stayed yt / and to have made the choice of the rest off no effect
/ by his negative voice but contrariwise that he was off so equal authority
with the rest off the Elders / that if they had chosen one unfit in some
respect / yet he could not off his own mere authority have put him back nor
done any more in this matter / the^ any off the rest. And that he could only
take heed unto him self / that he allowed not any unripe or unworthy
Iudgme^tes off other officers. Therefore there is no cause which they should make
Tymothie the Author off this ambition and tyranny.

Now let us examine also the example off Titus whom they do trewly affirm to
have been commanded to appoint Elders in every city / but I suppose no man
will thinck that Paul granted more to Titus / then either he and Barnabas /
or then all the rest off the Apostles took unto them selves neither if he had
granted / is it like that Titus being a young man and his scholar and as it
were his son / would have used it? For as the Jews say in a common proverb /
it is enoughe for the servant to be like his master / which saying also
Christ him self allows when he said that the disciple is not above his
master: Luke 6.40.
And that it owght to be enowghe for the scholar if he be such as his master
is. But I have showed allredy what both Paul and all the rest off the Apostles
did. Neither is it ^ike that Titus did otherwise ordeine Elders in every town
then Paul did in every church: especially seeing Paul does expressly warn
him to appoint them as he had commanded / for I se no cause whithis may not
as well be referred to all the manner off ordeininge of the^ as to that which
follows. Therefore that at the last I may conclude all this matter The
Eua^gelistes ar no more Patro^es for this matter then the Apostles were /
neither is there any the lest deed or word off any off them whereby this tyranny
may be allowed. Therefore let them confess as the things in deed That this
mischife was borne and bred at Rome: which after together with the empier spread
it self over into all lands.

But all the question off the chosers off Ecclesiastical officers is not yet
thus ended: For all though I have concluded owte off the word off god / that
one man can not usurp this power without tyranny / yet here arise new pleas
and controversies / And it is doubted whether this be equally to be permitted
unto all / or only unto certene chosen men that exercise ordinary Jurisdiction
in the church. As for me when I consider both the holy scriptures and the
example off the best reformed churches / I thinck it most agreing with / the
will off God that that Senate and counsel which exercisethe ordinary
authority in all the affairs off the church and whom for the same cause the
Apostle calls leaders and over seers / and exhorts the church to obey them
an suffer it selffe to be ruled by the^ / should also have most a do in this
busynes / to govern the Election and to guide and direct the judgment of the
rest of the church with there wisdo^e and authority. Heb. 13.7.17. 1 Thessalonians.
5.12.


Neither do I bring in here any Oligarky or tyrannous rule off a few and
reteyne still the same tyranny in the church / chaunginge only the persons.
For I would not that the judgment off the rest off the church should be
contemned and neglected or that the counsel or elders off the church should
off there own authority set one over the church whom they list against the
churches will / but that the Elders goinge before / the people also follow /
and having hard and vnderstorde there sentence and decree / may either by some
outward token or else by there silence / allow it if it be to be liked off / or
gain say it if it be not just and upright: And not only gain say yt / but
if just cause of there dislikinge may be brought make it altogether void and
off none effect / until at the last a meet one may be chosen by the
authority and voices off the Elders / and allowed off by the consent and
approbacion off the rest off the church / So that herein there is no cause to
co^pleine that by the bringing in off the rule of a few / the majesty off the
wholl church is diminished. we read in deed that it was some what otherwise
practiced in the sixth and fourthe^et off the Acts / and that the people had
the chief power and authority in those elections: but that me thinck was done
for a special cause which does not in like manner belong unto us / neither
ought to be referred to the ordinary and perpetual government of the church.
For as in common welthes not only such where the people is to be made
sovereign / or a few / but also eue^ where the kingdom of one is to be
established before it be confirmed all the power is in the peoples hands / who
of there free will choose magistrates unto them under whose authority they may
after be governed: and afterward not all the people / but only the
magistrates chosen by them administer and govern the affairs off the common
wealth / So it comes to pass in the establishinge off the church: So that
when as yet there were none set over them / all the authority was in all men's
hands: but after that they had once given the helm into the hands off certain
chosen men / this power no longer belonged unto all / but only to those who were
chosen by them to steare and govern the church off god.

As for the election off Seacons / there was yet an other especial reason / why
yt was meet that they should have been chosen all the church. For when the
Grecians murmured against the hebrews and complained that they had wrong / for
that in the distribucion which was daily made for the help off the poor there
widows were not dewly regarded / It was need full, that they to whom this
charge was to be committed should be chosen by all the company / that all
occasion off complayninge and suspicion might be taken away. therefore / that
which once extra ordinarily was done by the people for certain special and
particular causes and respects / ought not to be referred to the perpetual /
certain / stable / and ordinary manner of gouerninge the church. Although even
in this election the Apostles reserved unto themselves the chief authority of
^^yinge on of hands and allowing or dissalowinge the judgments and voices off
the people / which power and authority saying in the very time off the
Apostles the^ selfs and that by there allowynge / yt was translated to the
Ecclesiastical consell and the Elders that had the ordinari government as
after in dew place shall appear / whi shall I not thinck that the power also of
examininge and doing of other things that perteine to the election is to
gether with the other translated unto them. Therefore keepinge the right liberty
off the church I conclude out if the word off god and the examples off the
Apostles / That no thing be done not only against the god will theroff / or
vnknowinge to the same / but also not with out the consent and approbation off
it. But we must keep also the just authority off the elders / that they go
before the people in the election: that they try and examine those that a^e to be
chosen / that they judge off there worthiness / and publishe unto the church /
whom they have thought mee^e and worthy / that being allowed by the consent
off a^^ / they may bey received / for thus the wholl body off the church is
b^st preserved when every part and membre does his office / when the eyes do
see and lead the way and the other parts suffer them selves to beled and
guided in the way. But the Elders in elections as also in all the rest off the
government off the church / ar as E^es unto the rest: and lead and direct
them that either through ignorance / or being blinded with there own desires
they slide not in the way. For which causes I said they are called governors /
Over seers and Elders. And how shall the people be able to judge off the diverse
gifts off the Spirit off god? to chose this man to govern / that to teach
and an other to ouerse the treasury off the church: for as these be diverse
offices / so to discharge them well they had need to be indewed with diverse
guiyftes off the holy ghost that be chosen thereunto: as after shall be declared
more at large in there several offices.

But every man is not able to judge off these diverse guyftes which are fit for
what purpose / and at yt were made and appointed off God: especially in this
age and in these days / wherein all things ar so corrupted that the most part
followinge the pleasures off this life / ar smally careful for the right use
off spiritual gifts / where off notwithstanding the Apostle would have no man
ignorant / And allthoughe many were able to judge in other charges who ar meet
/ and unmeet / how few be there that could make trial and assay off a minister
/ that could examyn his gifftes and make due search and trial what godliness /
what lerninge / or what ability he were off to edefy the church. And suerly
if all men were so taught off god that they could know and judge off these
things / then in deed we should need no certain choosen men / who by there
spiritual wisdom and discretion / should govern and direct the Judgments
off the people: we should not then need to fear the chosinge off any unworthy
or unable to edify the church: there would be no danger off confusion and
vproares.

These in deed should be the bancketes that they commend so highly / that are the
dayntier the more there be that bring there dishes to it / and the Gosyppe
feasts which they praise so much: Elections made by the people where every
man gives his voice, are compared by some (...) ba^ket (...) where e^^ry man
brings his dish^: which is so much the dainter the more there be that come
unto yt.
which when they can prepare for us / we are so fare off that we would not sit
down being bidden that with great thanckes to the host that so should receive
us we would take great pleasure in the use off so so exquisite daynties: and
prefer them before the most deyntie feasts off the Syracusians / and such a
table / before that golden table off the son that Herodotus does mention. But
saying these things ar rather to be wished then hoped or looked for / let us
keep that order which I have described being most agreeable to the decrees of
the Apostles / to edificacion / the chiefest and most sacred law off
discipline and furthest off from confusion and tumultes: which is that the
ecclesiastical counsel when need shall be / provide fit men for the church
in every function and office / examine and try them diligently and carefully /
then choose them / after publishe and make known there election unto the church
/ and last off all being allowed by the church / lay there hands upon them and
so stablishe them in there place and calling by there authority.

But paraduenture I have tarried longer in this part then needed: seeing we are
not troubled with the lightness and confusion off populer elections / but with
lordshipp and tyranny: which I cannot se may continue with the safety off the
church which it has already almost overthrown / so that speedy remedy is to
befound lest we lament to late the ruin off our decaying church.

Now as for Elections / there must allwais goo before them a due proof and
trial off the worthynes off the parties that are to be chosen. For that which
the Apostle to Timothe commands concerning Deakons / That they also be fist
examined and then (if there be no other cause to the contrary) admitted to there
deaconshipp / does plainly prove that examinacion owght to be had before that
election and choice be made to any ecclesiastical office and function / for
which cause also S. Paul does no less declare the manner / how to prove and
try a bishop or ministers / then to examine the Deacon: and there is the same
end and use off examinacio^ in all / which is: That no charge be committed to
an unfit man or not able enoughe for the office / whereby it might come to pass
that both the church should want her needful and necessary helps / and that
the holy offices should be profaned. Therefore the church ought to choose no
man but whom they know before to be chosen off God: for it stands upon the
government off his house / whose keys it is unlawful to commit unto any / to
whom the Son and heir that great steward off the house off David upon whose
shoulder the master off the house has laid the keys / has not thought good
to credit and commit them unto.

But God chooses no man to any office whom therewith all he does not indewe
with meet gifts for the discharginge off it: for otherwise / how should he
ask account off doing the office off him whom he compelled to bear and take
it upon him / knowinge him unmeet and unable for it. Therefore no man is sent
out off god without worthy gifts into any part off his government / but for
the burden and function that he lays upon him / he ministers also strenght
and force to bear it. And this is the meaning off the often repeatinge in the
book off Judges off that sentence. The Spirit off the Lord came upon him and
he judged Israel: and many such like examples are to be found in the old
Testament off Moses and Joshua / off the Prophets Esaias and Jeremy and many
other / who^ when the Lord meant to use in any the lest charge off his church /
he therewith all endeweth them with worthy gifts / for the good execution
theroff. Exodus 3.11.12. and 4.11.12. Deu. 34.9. Esai 6.5.7 8. Iere.
1.5.6.7.8.9.10. Esa. 61.1. Luke 4.21.


And in the new Testament our Savior Christ him self took not upon hi^ to
deal in the mediator his office / before he had received the holy ghost whereby
he might be furnished withmeet gifts for the full discharge and execution off
it. For so Esaias expressly Prophesithe off him / The pirit off the Lord is upon
me, therefore he has anointed me, he has sent me to preach the Gospel unto
the pore, etc. Out off which place when see that first he received the Spirit /
or ever that office and embassage was enjoined him: and that he was anointed
before he came to the wrestling and exercise. So lickewise the Apostles
allthoughe they had been taught by our Savior him self (the most heavenly
schole master that could be) for three years and more / and had after a sort
received the holy ghost by his breathinge upon them / yet because they had a
great battle to fight / and much travel to be taken / and many dangers to
adventure into / he geuethe them warninge that they enter not into the listes
rashly and unprovided / but commands them yet to tarry and wait for the
promise off the father and more plentiful guiftes off the holy ghost. Hither
also belongethe the ceremonies used in both the Testamentes / in ordinacion or
consecracion as we call it. For what else does that anoyntinge off the priests
/ kings / and Prophets declare But those guyftes wherewith they who were
anointed were endewed by the holy ghost for the execucion off there offices? To
this also the layinge on off hands in the new testament is to be referred /
which declares that the Lord had laid on his hands before and given them
worthi gifts for the places they were called unto.

But what do I trauelinge so carefully in this behalf? does not nature it
self and reason and common experience teach us this: when some ar set over
the city / and common wealth / that they are choosen counselors / whom great
lerninge and long life and dilligent obseruacion and experience it self has
taught that worthy and hard knowledge off gouerninge the common wealth: Ought
not I say daily experience teach us that we prefer not them that are
unworthy to honors and offices? Therefore so much the more ought we to be
ashamed off our most grievous fault in this behalf that suffer even the most
unworthy to take upon them the most weighty calling off the ministry: and
set open the church doors to every base Artificer that leapethe from his shopp
board / to the plowman that leaves his share / to youge scholars in gra^mer
and Philosophy / that are nothing more conninge in heavenly things then
Artificers and husband men: finally to minstrells and harpers / to noble and
gentelmens servants / to Neateherdes Shepherdes and porters and sometimes not
only to unlearned men but also men off most filthy life and conversation /
chosinge into that most weighty office learned an unlearned / good and bad /
worthy and unworthy / with out any chois or difference: which how lawfully it
is done / yt shall after appear. Here only because the use off examinacion is /
that unable men be not admitted to any office in the church / I meant generally
te note / how grievously and against the express commandment off God / we
offend in this behalffe / and to desire and beseech them that have authority
to amend these things in the name off God / who will not suffer unpunished the
trangression off his holy Ordinances: and in the behalf off the church to
whose destruction and decay such things are daily committed / that we de not
with Jeroboam make common this worthy and sacred office with most vile and
unworthy persons / that we neglect not the use off examininge / and holy
ordinance off god / that we destroy not the church / bringinge this sweep
into the church / but that rather decreeinge according to the word off god /
that unworthy men be not preferred to Ecclesiastical functions / we may both
hereafter keep out such / and also thrust out those that by deceuinge off men
and false commendacio^ ar crept into the church allreedy / and compel them to
leave there places.

But let us return from whence we have digressed and follow the manner off
examynacion / declaringe it as fare forth as it is general and perteyneth to
all the offices and functions off the church. For as every office has his
several guystes / which are necessary to the dew execucion off it / So certain
things ar to be required and looked for in every eccesiasticall office: which
as I have observed out off Saint Paul ar chiefly two: wheroff the fast is
that they be fownd and sincere in the faith / The second / that they be with
out reprehension in life and manners As for requyringe religion in a minister /
I need not to give any reason off it / saying that they are choosen to be
teachers and interpreters off the same. And for Deacons the Apostle expressly
warns Tymothe that they be such as have the mystery off faith (which after
in the same chapter he callethe the mystery off godlynes and declares what it
is) in a pure conscience. 1. Timoth. 3. ^ 1. Timoth. 3.^^. ^^t. ^1.
So lickewise all the Apostles monishe the church off Jerusalem / that they
should choose seven Deacons from among them selves. It is not needful in
this place to declare what they ought to thinck off religion which is a large
matter / and would require a several treatise for it self: yet
notwithstanding it is well enoughe known unto all men and briefly comprehended
in that place off Paul which I spoke off before / and it is no hard matter /
to know what they thi^cke off the true knowledge / and worship off God / saying
they make profession off the same that the church does / whereunto they ordeine
themselves. And if it were needful they might delare there judgment
particularly in every point being demanded.

And yet here is not any common or vulgar knowledge and zeal of religion to be
required / but special and singular above other men. For there is no ne so
small a function in the church / that does not as it were exempt the^ out off
the number off other men / and ioyninge them as it were nearer to God / does
lay a necessitye upon them being placed in higher degree / to shine and give
example unto others and stire them up by there means / to all vertewe and
godlynes. Therefore the Apostles when the Deacons were to be chosen / required
that they should be men full off wisdom and the holy ghost.

As for the examination off manners / the Apostle him self has declared it so
particulerly / that no man can be deceived herin / whereas he gives warninge
that they be not infected with covetousness or dronkennes or any other more
grievous or infamous crime / but that they be off good report and honest
estimacion with all men / and such as all men can witness off them that they
have lived a good and an honest life, 1. Timoth. 33.8. 1. Timoth. 3.7. Act.
6.3. 1. Timoth. 3.4.
yea it is further also to be considered how they have brought up there children
and how they have governed there private families for therein wise men will
observe many things / whereby they may be able to judge whither they be meet to
take upon them any public charge or no / for he that shall ouerturne askuller
or a payer off Oars in the Temmes / who will thinck him meet to govern the
Queens barge: or some great vessel upon the sea? This is therefore that law off
God / which towchinge the examinacio^ and trial off ecclesiastical offices /
the Lord him self has given unto the church and has commanded that it
should allways be kept and observed. In kepinge wheroff surely both the
estimacion and safeguard off the church consists. For by this means the
church shall have both necessary helps for her use / and worthy ornaments
for her estimacion where by both all occasion off evil speakinge should be
taken from her enemies that are allwais ready to deface her for the least
occasion / and the name off God / by means off the church should be glorified
before all men.

Therefore lest the name off God and his holy Gospel may be evil spoken off
for our cause / lest the church want the necessary helps which yt needs for
the preseruacion theroff / a careful heed is to be had herein / to whom the
charge off admynistringe off yt is to be committed / which trial and
examinacion saying yt is so plainly describes by the Apostle / yt is meruell
how that there be every where so many with us both corrupt in doctrine and
defiled in life and conversation. For how many Papists be there now a days /
that even fiften years after the reformacion off religion / occupy the place
of ministers in the church / partly being left in those churches which before in
time off Popery they unjustly held / partly also entered in our time and since
the prechinge off the Gospel? How many also be there admytted to the government
off the church off most wicked life and ungodly behauior? Therefore seeing the
Papists openly declare that they are grievously offended herewith / neither can
be brought to esteem that to be the true religion off God / whose preachers ar
so dishonest and the interpreters wheroff ar so defiled / why do some complain
that both other myschifes ar spronge of this reformacion which we require / and
especially this that the Papists being offended with our contencion are
further estraunged from embracinge the gospel? For what is it that may more
further there salvation then iffthes offenses be taken away whereat they stumble
and ar hindered? Off which so shameful disorder as there be many causes / so I
always esteemed that the greatest and most weighty / That we leauinge this
exact manner off tryenge and examininge which the Lord has commanded us to
observe and follow in this behalf / keep only I cannot tell what shadow and
image off yt which we received from the Papists. The receiuinge off which one
error (to follow the fancies off men in stead off the certain laws off god)
has brought in (as usually yt does) infinite other: whereby it comes to pass
that the most worthy order and degree is most unworthily profaned / that the
church like the popish sanctuaries is full off vile and vicious persons off
all sorts / and the gospel evil spoken off by the enemies.

For whereas certain men have authority that every one off them twice a year
may give orders to whom and to how many they list / and that so great a
multitude off suitors come to them at the time off giving off orders / how is
yt possible that one man in a day or two should be able to prove and to examyn
so many sewters being all for the most part unknown to him? how can he take
any assay or make any trial either off Judgment in religion / or off there
honesty in conversation? For to subscribe is a small matter with them that
thinck it the point off a wise man to dissemble / that dispense with them
selves to do any thing that they may distroy the church thereby / and whom
Euripides has persuaded to swear with the tongue and to keep the mind
unsworn.

Neither is that excuse that is brought for those off dishonest life any thing
more sufficient which is wont to be made / by the testimonialles which commonly
the suitors being unto them: saying the Apostle expressly warnethe Timothe that
he be not brought by other men's Judgments to lay hands to sone upon any man
/ But if other do it rashly / yet he should keep him self free and unspotted
from any such fault / Although every man knows what weight these
testimonialles ar off / saying some off favor commend there kinsfolks and
Allies unto the Bishopp by there lettres: or others whom they would gratify by
there authority: other some even for covetousness / and hopinge to divide the
pray with them that by there means obtain the benefice: For the covetousness
off some Patrons is to to well known / who for there own gain sake will
covenant with him / with whom they may for least: and sometime if they have
any servant in the house that can read / because the matter may be more easylie
gone throwgh / with such a one (who would be very willinge to give the greater
part off his benefice if he obtain yt by his masters commendacion and
authority / to change his vile and base estate with some more honest and
liberal condition) they writee for him to the Bishop / who having this
testimonial / either for negligence / or often times to curry favor with such
men / does easylie adimit him. Therefore there must be a trial off
ecclesiastical officers / that all dishonesty may be taken away from that most
worthy order and degree / that ought to be a pattern and example to all other.
which being done / order would be taken that here after before Electio^s /
there be a dew and just proof and trial had of those that are to be chosen:
that we may exactly keep and follow the Lords Canons and decrees in this
behalf / in keepinge whereof other churches at this day florishe and have done
now a long time. And thus much off Election, now let us come to ordinacion.
Ordinacion is a settinge a part off the party chosen unto his office / and as
it were / a kind of inuesting him into it. For after the election / a certain
order and ceremony is wont to be used / whereby the parties chosen enter as it
were anto the possession off there office. Now this ordination as we call it
consists especially in two ceremonies: Namely in prayer (whereunto also I
refer the declaringe off his dewty) and laying on off hands. For the gospel
is content to have the ministers theroff invested and ordained by these most
simple ceremonies / nor has any need off that careful and curious
consecracion off the law with which the priests and Levites were consecrated.

And as for prayers / S. Luke tells that when Paul and Barnabas were
commanded by the holy ghost to be separated for the worck off God: Act. 13.9.
the breethren prayed for the^ before they were sent out to go on there message.
Lickwise also the Apostles prayed for the deaco^s which the people had chosen /
that the lord would bless this new chamberlainshippe as it were / to his
honor and the profit of his church: Acts. 6.
that he would e^dew the parties chose^ with worthy gifts and able the^ for
the worthy execution of there office. For there is no doubt but the Apostles
applied there prayers to the time and state of the church / and that as before
in the election of Matthias / so now also in the admissio^ and allowance off
the Deacons / they prayed as the present occasion off the business did require
which was then to be done.

The other ceremony is the layinge on off hands in prayer time upon the head
off the chosen: for so it seems that it was wont to be used / as a thing
belonginge unto prayer: that bringing in the chosen before God / and as it were
presentinge the^ unto him / the prayers off the church might be kindled and be
the more zealous and vehement. and that it was wo^t to be used to this end / yt
apearethe both by other places where mencio^ is made thereof in the scriptures /
and also in the 19. off Matthew / when he tellethe that children were brought to
Christ that he might lay his hands on the^ and pray for them / as also in that
place of the acts which I named before wherein it is repeated that the Apostles
prayed / laying on there hands upon the Deaco^s which were chose^ by the
church. But this is a general e^d. Act. 13.3.
There be other proper and peculier uses of it / wheroff the first pertains to
the party chose^ / the second to all the church. The party chose^ was warned
by this ceremony / that he was separated and set apart to the worck off god as
appears in the 13. off the act. and that he was taken out off the rest of the
people to the doing off that office as it were by the hand off god him self /
whereby he might understand that it was no longer in his own power to do what
he list / but that god had called him to his work off whom he should have a
ple^tiful reward if he did finishe and perfect it / and off the other part a
judge and a reue^ger if he did contemn and neglect it. 1. Timoth. 4.14.
Therefore S. Paul stirring up Timothe to the dilligent discharge of his dewtie
/ in all parts makes mencio^ off layinge on of hands / warning him that he
neglecte not that place and calling which he was called unto for to prophecy
by the layinge on off the hands off the Elders / Furthermore there is yet an
other use off this ceremony which belongs to the confirminge and strenghtning
off him that is chosen: who was admonyshed thereby to remember that the same
hand was allways ready to help to ease his burden and to bear him up that had
laid it upon him / that being assured to have been called to his office off god
/ he might execute yt with great courage being terrified with no fear or
danger. The second use and commodity hereoff that perteyneth unto the church
is / that they saying this authority to be off god / and the party set over
them in his name / should acknowledge and learn to reverence those that have
care and charge over them / and to be obedient unto them in such things as
perteine unto there office.

And this is the right use off that layinge on off hands which is used in the
ordering off ministers. Which being left and forsaken / the Papists and we
that with out any judgment keep there fond and foolish Traditions use an other
sort which was never practiced in ordeininge off the Officers off the church
/ But in giving off the gifts of the holy ghost to all those that believed and
were baptized: not that Ordinary laying on off hands (the use wheroff ought
allwais to remain in the church / but that which was extraordinary and served
only for a certain time and season. For by cause the Apostles. when they as the
stewardes off God did distribute the holy ghost / that is to say the diverse and
manifold gifts off the spirit to them that embraced religion used this sign
and as it were this sacrament off laying on off hands / These Ioly fellows who
notwithstanding that power off geuinge the holy ghost was ceased / kept still
the sign / and laying there hands upon the priests / bad them receive the
holy ghost which no man gave them / no nor cold give them unless yt were
extraordinarily / this being proper to those times and to the apostles only,
neither do they consider that this ceremony is far unlike the other which they
used to the ordeininge off the officers off the church / for this was wont to
be used in those days all most to all the faithful / The other to those only
that had some charge in the church / and that when they gave the guiftes off
the holy ghost extra ordinarily: Act. 19.2.5. Act. 8.17.
This was nothing so as may plainly appear out off the places which I have
named above both off Paul and Barnabas and also off the Deacons.

And as for Paul that he had received the holy ghost and was endewed with those
extraordinary guyftes before that hands were laid upon him on this sort / It
may be proved by that / that Christ had appeared unto him from heaven and made
him a worthy vessel to bear his gospel into all parts / so that straight
way he preached in the synagoges and declared Christ to be the son off god.
Act. 9.16.20.
As for Barnabas Saint Luke does plainly witness that he was full off the holy
ghost (whereby I understand the extraordinary guistes) and off faith whom
also before he testified to have been one off those that first professed the
Gospel / so that the laying on off hands which followed in the xiij. Act.
11.24. Act. 4.36.
off the acts was no geuinge off new gifts / but as the holy ghost speakethe
in that place a separacion and setting a part / and as it were a consecracion /
to the goinge about off a great work and taking upon him a more trauellsome
charge and office.

As for the Deacons we read that the Apostles when they were to the chosen /
gave warninge that they should choose me^ full of wisdom and off the holy
ghost / whereby I doubt not But that they signified / that they should choose
off them that were qualified with those singular and diverse gifts and that the
church according to there prescription / did choose the Deacons from emonges
those three thousand which Saint Luke had spoken off before. Therefore that the
Bishopp in ordeininge off ecclesiastical officers and layinge his hands upon
them / biddethe them receive the holy ghost has no shadow or show of any
practice off the Apostles / but is a Popish rite and ceremony folishly at the
first and with out any foundation off the scripture instituted by them / or who
so ever were the authors off it / off an imitacion off that which is not in
deed / But which they thought to be: And after received by the authors of our
discipline (by there leave) with no great Judgment / and yet kept in the church
with as little.

There remainethe yet one thing in this matter off Ordinacio^ to be declared /
which is to who^e the right and authority off ordeining belonges. A point not
so hard to be declared as that which has already been handled off Election /
Saying that there can be found no example where any one / or the whole church
have used this authority in all the holy scriptures. Neither any precept or
commandment / whereby either the Bishops or the people should thinck the
right hereoff to perteine unto them. For as for that place off Paul to Tymothe
which allwais they object against us. Take heed thou lay not thy hands rasshly
upon any, I trust it is sufficiently answered allredy / and declared how that
in those words there is nothing granted to Timothe above his fellows / And
that he was warned only to take heed off him self that he were not led away
by other men / or should thinck that if he did anything rasshly yet might be
excused by the example and authority off others. But contrariwise we read
every where that in all ordinations there were mo that laid on there hands / or
if one did it yet all this matter was ruled by the authority off the counsel
off the church. Thus the Docters and Prophets off Antioche ordained Paul and
Barnabas in the xiij. off the Acts: lickwise the xij. Act. 13.1. Acts 6.6.
Apostles in the sixthe off the Acts laid there hands upon the Deacons that
were chose by the church.

And lest we should doubt to which off the ordinary offices off the church
the Apostles had left this power and authority Saint Paul declares that yt
was the Elders that laid there hands upon Timothe. 1. Timo. 4.14.
Off which patrimony left by the Apostles / the Bishop in deed (such a one I
mean as Paul describes in his first Epistle to Timothe and the third chapter
/ and in the first to Titus) is fellow heir with others / and succeeded in some
part as after more largely shall be declared when I handle the authority off the
Elders: But to be sole and only heir / they shall never prove by any right off
the Testament or the will of the Testator / nor that this possession is
occupied by them without most unjust fraud and open violence and wrong.

Therefore saying as I proved hitherto therbe many and grievous faults in our
discipline / saying the most holy laws off god / left unto us by the Apostles
for the government off his kingdom are violated and broken / Saying the
fancyes off men and the pleasures off servants are preferred above the
commandment of Christ the king / Saying the church is so destroyed which he
redeemed by his blud / the holy offices profaned / and all things mingled
and confounded to geether / Let us at the lenght earnestly and carefully think
to amend these things / let us in deed obey his precepts and laws / whom in
words we acknowledge to be our king: Let the church and the good estate and
estimation theroff be dear unto us. By fetchinge the discipline off the church
from me^ and from the Canon law / we do wrong to Christ our Prophet and our
prince / and open a spring and founteine off errors in the church. Let us
therefore stopp those pittes and go to the founteine off the word off god. As
subjects let us depend upon the will off our king: And let us make this first
the most weighty law in the reformacio^ of our discipline / that nothing be
done in it besides his word and commandment / and that all things be framed
to this good will and pleasure. So that if he has forbidden any man to enter
into the church / to take upon him any public person therein or execute any
office / but unto which he is chosen and called by him / if he has
grievously punished the transgressors off this law who despising his
commandment and goinge without the bands that they were compassed with /
break into other men's ground and have been so bold to profane the holy
charges with there defiled hands / let us see and be careful that there be no
such thing emonges us: and at the last let us command thence Popish priests
/ women that baptize in secret / chauncellors / Archedeacons and there servants
the Commissaries / and Officialles and the rest off that trashe that take upon
them the administringe of discipline / to leave off / and do there own business
/ and suffer these things to be executed by the^ that are called thereunto by
the lawful apointment of god.

There is great fruit and commodity that comes by a lawful calling: Let us
take heed therefore that we loose it not by ambition and bribery. Christ has
committed a certain province to be governed by his ambassadors / And who^ he
callethe to any office he apointeth where and among wwhom to execute it: why
then do so many go wandringe and straying among us? Why do we grant so lose
embassages? why do we commit an office to any man / who^ we apoint not where and
among who^ to execute it (especially saying these wandringe and unstable
charges / are wont to bring infinite evil after the^. But if any man has an
office committed unto him / if his city / place and church be assigned where to
exercise it / let hi^ diligently perform which he has taken in hand: And if
he do it not willingly / let the magistrate compel him to amend his dewty / or
let him be put out off his office.

And for those faculties and dispensacions that exempt such as will purchase
them from this necessary doing off there duty / let us take away and abolishe /
as having first proceeded from Antichrist him self / and yet not with out great
offense received emonges us / and decree according to the word off God that
who so ever is chosen to any ecclesiastical office shall carefully and
diligently look unto it / as one that is to give account off the execution
theroff in that noble and famous day off the coming off Christ. In elections
/ taking away the usurped tyran^y off the Bishops and all that confusion
which I have declared / whereby dew trial and examination is hindered / let the
lawful choosers have there right restored to the^ again: Let there be diligent
and exact examination had off those that are to be chosen: Let offices be given
for worthynes and not for other respects / lest both the holy offices be
profaned / and the church wanting her necessary helps and stays fall to the
ground: last off all Let us restore the right and true use off Ordeining and
laying on off hands / and abolishe and take away this false and forged abuse
theroff. Thus far have I handled those things that are to be amended out off
the word off god in this part / which equally belongs to all the offices off
the church. Now follows the next part which declares what is proper and
peculier to every one: which also has merueilous need off correction and
amendment.

Thus therefore having fynished that part wherein I have fully and at large
handled those things that perteyne equally unto all that bear any office in
the church / It follows to show how many sorts off them there be and what
every man has common with other / or proper or peculier unto him selffe. Off
ecclesiastical offices therefore sum are ordinary and perpetual in the church
/ and some are extraordnary which were used for a time but ceased afterward
to be used any more. For in the first age off the church / by the great goodness
of god toward his people that was but then young and tender / many diverse
heavenly gifts were given. Which after when the church had grown strong and
the gospel had been sufficiently confirmed with those mirackles / were no longer
given: but a certain firm and stable order was set to govern the church by
for ever. Which were / rather as Saint Paul calls them gifts and Graces /
then ordinary offices off the church / No man I thinck can doubt but that they
are ceased / saying the gifts are given no more.

The question is somewhat harder off the office of Apostles / Evangelists and
prophets / which all saying they are occupied in preachinge off the word I
will defer to prove they also are ceased / to that place where I deinde all
those that have charge to interpret the word off god into two sorts: Therefore
in the mean season omitting the extraordinary I will begynn with the ordinary
offices off the church / wheroff saying some be simple / and others some
compounded / I will in the first place more fully and at large as the matter it
selffe requirethe speak off the first first and more simple part whence also
the latter does wholly spring. Therefore all the perpetual and ordinary
offices off the church that are simple / are contained in the holy scripture /
in these two names off Bishopps and Deacons: for all though the words them
selffes are not so exactly or as I may say so curiously observed / as also it
was not needful they should / yet the sum and effect off this division is
every where retained. So Saint Paul in his first Epistle to Timothe / ^. Timo.
3.
instructinge his scholar / how to frame and set in order the church off
Ephesus (for the office off an Evangelist which Timothy bare) comprehends all
the offices and functions off the church in Bishopps and Deacons.

So also the same Apostle writing to the Phillipia^s whose church to as
already established and set in order / Paul (and as follows) To the Saints
which are at Philippi with the Bishops and Deacons / etc. In which place
understanding hy the name off Saints / the faithful and as it were the
citezens and body off the church / under Bishopps and Deacons he conteinethe
the governors and those to whom any public charge in the church is committed.
Somewhat otherwise in the xij. Romans 12.6.7.
to the Romans / but to the same sense / he deuideth ecclesiastical offices
into prophesing (which is there office whom he calls Bishopps in the two
places before named) and Deaconshipp which distribution is also kept by Peter in
the fourth of his former epistle. 1. Petr. 4.11.
But that keeping still the name off Deacon, he uses the word speech for
prophesyinge.

This therefore is the true division off ecclesiastical offices / distributed
by Christ's chief Apostles into these parts: whereby yt manifestly appears
that in a perfect and well established church there be both parts as it were
the right side and the left side off the body / and that neither off them can
be wantinge with out the great deformity and misshapinge off the whole. As also
off the other part there ought to be no office / no charge or function in there
church / which is not as it we^r a member off one of these ij. parts / and
inseperably joined with the rest of the body / by which form and pattern off
the Apostles / if we should examine the Roman church (I mean that Roman
church that fell from her first simplicity) and that lively image off the
beast which is described by Saint Ihon / framed and fashioned her self after
the form and pattern off the Roman Empire / as is declared by Clement / by
other occasions in his Epistles / what need have we here off a heavenly kind
off surgery to cut off the superfluity off so many and unnecessary and needles
parts / what wenns and what blemishes / were to be cut off and cured in this
behalffe? Apocalip. 13.11. 1. Epistle.
But there appears no less deformity in the want of those parts which are
natural and necessary / seeing that in the roman church / one whole part that
is off Deacons is wanting. Off both which so notable deformities / I would our
church were free / and that there were nothing in our metropolitan and other
mother and cathedral churches / that did imitate the superfluity off needles
parts and me^bres / for in the other deformity in wantinge necessary parts
we are nothing inferior to the Papists them selves / for the Deacons are alike
wanting in them both: as after more plainly shall appear when I come to that
place.

Now let us examine particularly the several offices: And first off all let us
speak off the Bishopp. The name off a Bishopp coming off the greek word
(...) does signify a watchman or a scoutwatch who is appointed to watch in
the camp or city and to declare the coming off the enemy: which name also
all though yt be sometime given to the Magistrate for that care he ought to
have off the people subject unto him / yet oftener and more properly to the
chieff charges off the church / and to those that are as it were the watch off
the city off god / to keep it not from fire and sword which mortal enemies
can bring against it / but from that everlasting fire and those fyry darts as
the Apostle calls them / whereby most mighty spirits and most deadly enemies
off the church / go about day and night to inflame the city with all. Act.
26.28.
Ephesians. 6.16.


But saying that even off these / some by special oath are more straightly
bound to continual watch and ward / namely they to whom are committed those
holy silver trompettes to declare to all men all the word and commandedement
off god / the com^inge off the enemies / to these properly and specially is
given in the third off the first to Tymothi / the first to Titus and other
places the name off Bishopp or wachmam. So that in old time this was rather a
name off labor then off rest / off burden then off honor / off business then off
ease. Now a Bishop (if we will trewly declare what he is) is the minister off
the church in heavenly things and such as perteine unto god. For this / I
thinck good to follow the wisdom off the Apostle in declaringe the office off
a priest under the law: Heb. 5.1.
seeing that bishops in the new testament have succeeded as touching the
government off such things / to the priests off the law. As for that I
enclose all the office off a Bishopp in divine service I ground upon the same
place off the Apostle who gives no more to the priests / whose office was
nothing less honorable then the Bishopes in this behalffe / yea had a greater
show off majesty and honor in certene points / in respect off those times which
had need off such things. So the Apostle contains the office off Timothe
although he were an Evangelist / in the government / and administracion off the
house off god / which is the church: 1. Timot. 3.15.
And to omytte many other places to this end / the Apostle to the Hebrews
co^prehendeth all the charge off the Elders in the cure off souls. Heb. 13.17,


And what greater and more sufficient witness can we have in this matter then off
Christ our Savior and our king who throwghly knew the nature off his kingdom
/ and had appointed to what use to put every one / how often does he declare
that his kingdom is not off this world / but off an other and more heavenly
nature / and such as parteineth to the procuringe off the salvation off men /
wherein for as much as his whole embassage / and charge which he received off
his father did consist / he was wholly occupied therein / his doingt and
meditation was allwais upon it / he meddled not him selffe with the things off
his world: Luke 9.58. and 12.13.14. and 21.25.26. John 18.36.
but day and night had his charge before his eyes and exercised him selffe
therein: warning also the Apostles that they should not hope to obtain the
glorious show and honor off this world / saying his kingdom was off an other
nature: yt rulethe the affections / yt gouernethe the troublesome mocions off
the mind / it morateth inordinate lusts / and brings every man to the doing
of his duty / yt lifts and raises up again those that were fallen and beaten
to the ground / it confirms those that are sick and weak with the grace mercy
and goodness off god: it brings men from received errors whereby they were cast
hedlong into all danger an mishiefe / to the true honoringe and worshipping
off god: he told them that he would use there labor to these ends: They should
keep his foulds and feed his flock and his lambs: Math. 4.19. John 21.15.16.17.
This should be there race to run in / These there listes wherein they should
exercise them selves / wherein if they behaved there selves with praise and
commendation they should look for as Saint Peter says an everlasting crown
off glory.

This is therefore the dewty off a Bishopp / which I will not here curiously
inquire how faithfully they execute / saying they be bownd to no special
charge but content with a general oversight off the Dioces / have exempted
them selfs from the necessary charge off the Bishops dewty. Let us rather
see wither I have justly compassed in the whole office off a Bishopp in the
handlynge off Religion and the service off God. For it is an old opinion and
received off long time / that Bishops are not so lymited with doing off the
service off God / But that they may also handle the things off this liffe and
govern both at once the church and the commonwealth. Heroff yt comethe that
our Bishops are Justices off peace / and have authority to see the Queens
peace kept and to cast the breakers off yt into prison / and bonds. That they
have authority to here pleas / and also to Judge off in there courts / pleas
off wills and Testamentes and other cyuill things. Heroff also it is that the
same titles off state and honor that are given to the noble men / are given to
them: whereas Archbishopes are saluted by the most honorable and Princely title
off Grace / An other is called Bishopp off the order off the garter: An other
Count Palatine: And all off them honorable Lords whereupon some are displeased
that the Chauncelorshipp off this realm / The Presidentshipp off york / and
such like honorable offices / which were wont in popery to be there is / are now
given to horable Lords off cyuill estate: And complain off yt as though they
had wrong offered them. Therefore they do unjustly and with out any cause / and
contrary to there dewty / desire / and vsurp these things / or else / I have not
done well to enclose all the office off a Bishopp in the administracion off
heavenly and spiritual things: In the cannons which are called the Apostles
canons, the 6.80. and 82 and Confil. Carthag. 3. Canon. 18.19.20.
wheroff let us se whither is to be thought.

That that is old and ancient / yt may sufficiently enoughe appear by this /
that such Ambition and busyinge off them selves is forbidden by the old Cannons
/ yea further / the grievous complaynt off some off the old farthers touching
this matter are known well enoughe and to be found in there writings / who
partly invey and sharply reprove them that brought in this confusion / partly
lament that by that means / they were called from there own particular dewty:
which also we here say some off ours do complain off / and confess that they
have only one hour in the week to think off preachinge: And that in a
manner won by force out off the importunity off clie^tes: whom Tere^cies
menedemus worthily would merueyle / at to see the^ to have so much leisure from
there own business / that they may look to other men's.

But this that is now so amplified and grown that it is become intolerable /
and no less dangerous for them selves then for thee church / sprange at the
first as all most all other mischiefs have done from begynninges that were not
so evil. For first off all this business was w holy pryuate / and
controversies were freely given over to the Bishops by the consent off the
parties / who trustinge there conscience / thought by this means to have the
best issue off there matter / After it grew / by the Authorytie of Princes: who
partly off a good mind but not wary enough / and off a desire to adorn and
beutifie the church / partly also because they them selves were hindered with
wars and external business / gave authority to Bishops to correct even
such with civil punishment as should troble the church.

Last off all it so infinitely spread out her bowghes by the couetousines and
ambicion off the Bishops / that there was no honorable office in the civil
state which they did not partly beg / partly receive willingly and with great
thanckes being offered / till they had myngled the church and the common wealth
/ civil and ecclesiastical matters / and confounded the kingdom and the
bishprick to gether. But as that which god has joined no mann can separate So
we may not thinck that any man can join or couple to gether that which he has
severed and divided a sonder. And if it be unlawful to altor and change the
bounds that our fathers have set / how much less is it laufull to change
those bounds and lymites that the Lord has bound us with all / and whereby
he would have us severed and divided from others / and by this deceit to
increase Patrimonies and possessions. Proverb. 12.28.
For that there is a great difference between the cyuill magistrate and them that
have charge off ecclesiastical matters / That sufficiently does prove / that
whereas first off all both powers were confounded together in Moses / The lord
leaving him only the charge off the commonwealth / committed the government off
the church to Aaron his brother. And set so great distance between them both
/ that the kingdom could not on^y not be governed by the high priest him
self / but also by none off the same family / name / or trib / Nor contrary
wise the priesthood / off any off the kings stock or off the royal b^ud /
house / or tribe / and finally off none but a Leuite / So they were divided a
sonder not only in there own persons / but also by families and by tribes:
which distinction and difference was allwais diligently observed by all that
came after / until king vzziah being puffed up with pride as it is expressly
noted in the holy history usurped the priesthood and burnte incense in the
temple off god. 2. Cron. 26.16.
But he went not away scotfree with his pride / but being suddenly stricken with
the leprousy was made an example for all ages to take heed off the like boldness
/ to confound and mingle those to gether which the Lord did divide and set a
sonder.

But there was no priest for many years after that meddled him self with the
government off the kingdom / until first Aristobolus most unadvisedly after
the return from Babylon / joined the kingdom and the priesthood / the myter
and the crown together. Eusebius. 8. book. of his preparation to the gospel.
For whereas we read that Elias / Samuel / and Daniel / exercised both offices /
It was alltogither extraordinary / neither ought to be drawn to the ordinary
and perpetual government off the church. All though under the law many
things were done by the Priests which cannot be now done by Bishops. And
they were put to many things to which yt were not lawful that the Bishops
under the Gospel should be applied which was in respect off the public law /
wheroff they were as well keepers and interpreters as off the moral / being
made and given by the same lord / so that it was needful to use them to many
things whereunto ours may not neither ought not to be put.

As for the Gospel what can be cleerer then the difference that it makes in
this case: whereas our savior him selffe off whose example we ought to learn /
refused to divide the heritage between the brethren as a thing not belonginge
to his office Luke 12.
/ and offten times he reprouethe and repressethe the like desyer off the
Apostles desyring and longyng after such things Math. 20.26. Luke 22.25.
Mark. 10.41.
/ he detested all this lordinge and exercisyng off domynion together with the
titles off princes and honorable personages and such like titles and names:
professinge freely that these honors were civil and wordly and therefore to be
sought for at other men's hands: which they should not thinck might begotten at
his hands that had no such like thing in all his kingdom: By whom they were
called indeed to greater offices / greater I say and more honorable in respect
off true honor / allthough not for the outward show.

And this the Apostles were taught not only by the precepts and voice off there
master / but after also by there own experience / that this spiritual charge
to be well done can be joined with no other / so that they gave over off them
selves / even the charge off the pore with is an ecclesiastical office and so
near off kindred unto the other / that it seemed they might well have stood
together / and lymited there office in he service off God alone. Act. ^.


And if it be so that the ministers off the word off god ought not to be
charged with providing for the widows and for the poor / that being free from
any other charge / they might wholly bestow them selves upon there own / how
much less lawful is yt / that they should be called away from there own
office and dewty to do worldly things and belonging to the civil Magistrate.
For thus thou do not only gather hindrances unto thy selffe / to hindre the^
that thou do not thy duty / otherwise then either good soldiers or conninge
wrestlers are wont to do / but also do wrong unto an other into whose
ground and possession thou breakest in by force / which thing saying the
Apostle in the xij. 1. Timot. 2.4. 1. Corr. 9.24.25.26. Romans 12.3.
off the Romans charge with ambytion and (...) business even in
ecclesiastical offices / when (...) ^^ligently from this being wiser then we
ought to be / exhorts us to a Christian like modesty / and to be soberly wise
/ how much more shall he be guilty off the same crime that mingleth and
confounds together things so far different and diverse off nature.

For who knows not that the office off the Magistrate especially consists
in those things which belong to our life and to our goods / and has not to
do with the holy ceremonies / but only to see by his authority that it be
administered by them / by whom / and in what manner it ought to be by the word
off God / but that he admynistred nothing him selffe: Romans 13.
And again who knows not that the Bishops Office is bounded and limited
with spiritual matters and cure off sowles / and has no charge off the common
wealth / nor off the state off this life? Heb. 5.1. and 13.17.
Or that the Magistrates are careful for the body and things belonginge
thereunto / The Bishops of the soul and that which apparteineth unto the
soul? And that the Magistrates are careful for this frail and britie life /
but the Ministers off that blessed life which endures for ever? Therefore
saying the Lord God under the law being about to plant the priesthood as a
tree hard by the Mgistrate his neighbors grownd / knowinge well what the nature
off this tree was (namely that it enlarges and spreads out his roots far
abrod as the figg tree or the olyue tree does / and therefore was to be set
further off lest that any contention or striffe should affterward arise) severed
yt by a most great distance / and greater then the space off ix feet which
Solon commanded in such like trees / from the Magestrates grownd that lay hard
by / let godly Magistrates diligently take heed / being admonished both by the
ordinance off the most wise god / and the example off the Roman Empire / that
they suffer the Bishops to challenge nothing unto the^ with in there ground /
nor secretly so root them selves with in the same / that they be afterward
compelled (as we read many Emperors have done) to strive with them for there
own right and patrimony. And saying God has punyshed the transgression off
this his law touching the distinction off the two estates / in a noble prince
and godly otherwise / why do we not fear that he will show the like
punyshement in the like fault off the Bishops? John 6.15.
And seeing Christ him self did refuse the kingdom being offered him / nor
would handle the lest eyuill matters / no not to agree brethren thereby / Saying
the Apostles would not join any other office though it were off the same kind
with there own / Luke 22. Act. 6.
no not the charge off the poor and widows / that they might bestow them
selves wholly and attend upon there own / saying this agreethe better with the
kingdom off Christ / and the other with the kingdoms off this world / what
just excuse can they lay for this ambition and busyinge off them selves / or
why do they storm so when we call them from the civil courts to the church
/ from the Justices benche / to Moses chair / from a kingdom and a lordshipp
/ to a Bishopric and ministry.

We read in the holy history that Azariaz the high priest cast out king
Vzzrah out off the holy place / and that worthelie / because the law so
commanded. 2. Chro. 26. Levit. 13.46. 2. book off his Ecclesiast. Histor.
And Sozomenus tells that when Theodosius themperor would have gone up to the
high part off the temple / Ambrose for badde him / because as he said / that
was the Bishops place / and com^anded him to sit below with out the chancell.
which I do not rehearse to this end that I do allow off those superstitious
and proud separations off the bishopps from other me^ / but seeing this there
inordinate desire off catching to them selves / to stir up kings and
magistrates to a just care of maintaining there own right / and in like manner
to bownd and lymit them within there chancelles and quyres / and command them
to keep them selves with in there bonds and limits / and to know also there
bars and ranges. And if they had carefully seen to to it when this plage
began first to creep in / surely the ambition off church men had never come
to that unspeakable pride that we have seen it at / that they might glory off
the power off both estates / and as we use to speak off both the swords / off
a triple crown / off treading upon the Emperors necks and suffering kings to
hold there stirruppes. But seeing they looked not unto it neither regarded it / at
the last when the Apostles were dead / who as in old time that noble worthy
Gedeon / desired not any unlawful kingdom or Lordshipp in Israel / and there
natural children desired lickwise no such thing / At the last I say / this
bastard Abimelech rose up: that ambitiously sought an unlawful kingdom / and
named hymsellffe bobothe a father and a king: but it is to be hoped that same
end and the like destruction will come upon this Tyrant that in old time came
upon Abimelech / for I doubt not but Ioathans parable is as it were an orackle
uttered against this ambicion: Judge. 9.10.
And it is alltogither to be hoped / that as the empire is weakened and almost
brought to nothing by him / whereby he has obtained this infinite and
princely power and authority / so it will one day come to pass that he
shall be destroyed again by the empire.

But would to god / that only the Bramble off Rome had desired this kingdom and
lordshipp: Judge. 9.8.9.10, 11. etc.
and that our olyue trees also and our figg trees and our vynes had not left
there fatnes and there sweetness and most excellent fruit / for the desire off
lordshipp and government. For the preaching off the gospel is in deed most
sweet and pleasant fruit: and with this there new wine they reioysed both god
and men: as also with the oil off the gospel more precious then any balm /
and off sweeter and more fragrant smell / then that which was poured upon
Aarons hedd. For we complain that even or bishops have gotten this lordshipp
into there hands: and find great want / and long for / those excellent fruits
again off that wine / and those figgas / and Olyues / which in old time the
church was wont to gather off there Bishopps. And surely I am afraid that we
wish and long for them in vain / and lest that they being delighted now
with an other kind off fatnes and off sweetness / that is off Riches and Honor /
have already begone to neglect and despise the other / and will so contynew
to despise yt. But the Lord will see to these things / who off his good will /
will provide for his church / either by them if they will come to the first
root and stock again / or else without them / yff they continue to neglect and
despise the same (But paraduenture I have been to long in this part / being
moved both with the unworthiness off the thing and the danger off the church.

Now seeing as I suppose yt is sufficiently proved that the office off a Bishopp
is lymited in the administration off heavenly and spiritual things / let us
particulerly declare the several parts off this office. Which consist partly
in teaching and interpretinge off the word off God / and partly in making
prayers for the church. For these two are so lincked together / that they may by
no means be separated. For he that takethe cure off teachinge the church /
has laid upon him also the prayinge for the church. And contrariwise the
office off prayinge and making solemn and public prayers for the church in
respect off his office / can / nor ought to be committed to no man / but to him
that has power also to teach the church. For we read that these two were
allways so joined and knit together / that he that off office did the one / was
bound to the doing off both. Neither have these at any time been severed or
drawn a sonder.

So the Priests under the law were bound to both: as Moses expressly
declarethe in the blessing off Leui. They shall teach says he Jacob thy
judgments and Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thy face and
bourne offeringe^ upon thy altar / For / that prayer and Supplication was
shadowed under the law by burninge off parfume and incense / It is plain by
many other other places and namely by David who without question in the 141.
Luke 1.10.
psalm alludeth hereunto: and the first off Luke where it appears that all the
church understood it so: Apocalip. 8.3 4. 1 S^^uel. ^^.2^.
whereunto also S. John alludeth in his revelation. Lickwise also the Prophet
Samuel answeringe the people that desired him that he would pray to god for
them / God forbidd says he that I should offend against God in ceasinge to
pray for you / for I will also teach you the good and perfect way. declaringe
there by both / to belong to his duty / So then in the Priesthood and the
Prophecy two off the chiefest offices in the Iewishe church (which our
Bishopps do resemble / if we compare the Pastors with the Priests / and the
Doctors with the Prophets) These two offices off teachying and prayinge were
joined together.

And do not the Apostles in the gospel where they leave the ministringe to the
pore / professing that they did it to this purpose that they might more freely
give the^ selves wholly to there office / do they not limit there office with these
two parts off preaching and Prayer? 1. Timot. 2.
Paul also in his epistle to Timothe does manifestly refer prayer to the
office off a Bishop: 1. Timot. 3.
whereas geuinge order off stablisshinge the church off Ephesus having declared
the form off public prayers / after shows at large / what man^er off man
he ought to be. Therefore seeing it is plain by the perpetual use off the
scripture that these two belong both to one and the same office / They cannot in
any sort be drauen a sonder: and an unlawful diuorcement it is / when as our
ministers (I speak off those Curates that are unable to teach) are off this
condition ordained to the ministry / that they read there seruise and
prescript prayers / out off the book: but that they be not so bold to teach
or interpret without new and especial authorite granted to that purpose.

But some men will say / They are not able to interpret the scriptures / Surely
if yt be so / they are well and worthily and by the commandment off god
forbidden to interpret yt / But that is not well / that they are not al so
forbidden to read the prayers: seeing that these two / preachinge and prayer
which are both but one office / are torn and drawn a sonder contrary to the
ordinannce off God / and a certain new and lame mynistery is brought into the
church / by the boldness off men. Thus therefore having described the whole dewty
and office off Bishops / let us come to that which is proper and particular /
in there eletion and ordination.

The Election therefore off Bishops (that I may be gyn^ there) because the
whole safety of the church is in danger in that actio^) ought to be joined
with most ernest prayer to god / that it would please him to direct the
judgment off the choosers which his holy spyrit / to provide a worthy and an
able Bishopp for his church / and not suffer them being ledd away by any blind
affection to be deceived with so dangerous an error. For hither both the
reasone which I have already brought and especially the example off (...)
Savior Christ him selffe does lead us / whom Saint Luke rehersethe to have
spent the whole might before the choosinge and declaringe off his Apostles / in
supplicacion and prayers / which also the same Luke reherseth to have been
practiced by the Apostles in the election off Mathias. Luke 6.12.13.
Act. 1.24.
Which all men understand ought to be necessarily restored again / that
observe and marck the success and fallinge out off our elections / far
otherwise taken in hand.

But I trust I shall not need to take much pains in so clear a matter:
Therefore I will go forward and declare what a one he ought to be / who should be
chosen a Bishopp / It is already plain enoughe by that which has been said
that in the choosinge off a Bishopp the especial care and respect ought to be
off his learning / saying he is chosen to teach and interpret the word off god
unto others: although also there ought to be no common and ordinary but a
singular and chief respect in examyninge his manners as being such whose
smallest faults for the high place wherein they are / can by no means be
hidden and covered. Seeing that the ministers off the word off God as Christ
warns the Apostles / are like unto cities that are upon the mountains.
Therefore saying they must dwell in the eyes off men and in the fairest light /
and as our Savior Christ says in the same place / be put as it were upon candel
sticks that they may give light unto other / It is meet that there holiness off
life / godliness and moderat co^uersacion should shine like lights a monges men
/ whervppon the Apostle Paul setting forth in Timothe a lawful minister off
the word / declares that he ought to be such / as may be an example / or
glass and a pattern to all the faithful in love / ^n chastity / and in all
the order off his life. Math 5.14.15.
1. Timoth. 4, 12.


And sure good cause it is he should be innocent / that asks other me^
account off there life: saying nothing is more just then that he that teaches
other should first instruct him selffe / and that calling other men from shame
/ he hold keep him selffe free from any spott or blemishe. For what a shame is
it / when the sick man may say to him that would help him / Physicion heal thy
self: or when those things are cast in a man's teeth which Paul vpbraydeth the
Jews with all / thou that teach an other teach not thy selffe and thou
that preachest a man should not steal stealest thy selffe / And again the
name off God is blasphemed among the gentiles for your cause. Romans 2.21.^. etc.
Therefore seeing that they are set in so high a pla^^ that the example off there
integrity not only edifieth the church but also glorifieth god thereby. And
contrariwise there faults and errors do give occasion to strangers to speak
evil off the Lord whom they preach / and the gospel which they publishe
abroad / and to the faithful that are weak / to whom the lest fault that they
make is as it were a law / whereby they think they may lickwise offend with out
reproof / and saying herein they hurt by there example no less / yea a great
deal more then by the fault it self / a great diligence and singular care is
to be had off the life and manners off him who is to be chosen a bishopp. But
saying the office off a Bishop consists chifely in this / that they publishe
/ preach / and interpret all the gospel / especially those gifts are to be
respected which are proper and peculier to that office / to the executinge
wheroff he is to be chosen / therefore he is to be examined how well he has
been exercised in the holy scriptures / and whither he be able fruitfully /
and to edifyinge / to communicate with the church that which he does godlilie
understand. No unskillful or unlearned man may be called to the stearing off
this helm / unless we would have the shipp not only to be in danger / but
willingly to run upon the r^kes: But what is he (unless he were co^spired
against the safety of the church and of the son^es off god) that would commit
the church which god redeemed with his blud that he might adopt us to be his
sons / an this nobleship fraighted full off worthies to any but to some most
conninge and expert pilote and master.

Therefore such con^ing Pylotes and governors ar to be chosen and set to the
stearinge off the shipp / who ar able to discern the diverse face and
chaungeable contenaunce of the heavens / that are able to for seestormes and
te^pestes / that can guide there ship by the north starr / and finally whom those
heavenly muses have taught the unknown paths and wais of the sea / and that
which is in the Poet.

From smoky storm and fluddes that swell,
Keep of the shipp and guide it well.
But the word of god is the only starr whereby this life is Our eyes must be
bent upon this heaven and fyrmament whereby storms and tempests are much more
certainly fore seen then by the other / This is the helm off our life which who
so ever has not learned to steare and govern / he may well be put to some
other service / but let him not come into the stern and if he he do / let him
be put out aagaine. For it is very good reason to require off an Artificer
knowledge off that art which he professes / to require off a Captain^ and a
General / knowledge and skill off war fare and chieualty / off a physicion /
that he know how to mayteyne the health and to recover them that are diseased.

And under the law the Lord appointed his priests that they should be such as
might be able when they were asked / to answer out off the law off God. Which
were adorned not only with the diadem and myter but with those xij. Exodus 28.^0.
Iewelles and precious stones which Moses for there lightsome clerenes and
perfect beauty calls Vrrim and Thummim: by means wheroff they asked off the
Lord in all affairs: by which two names sometimes all the priesthood is
signified / to teach us that he that has not them / has nothing. Deuteronomy. 33.8.
And that there is no priesthood with out Vrim and Tummim. To whom saying the
Bishops as parteininge to to this matter have succeeded / although they had
put on Aarons tunicle Ephod or Diadem / yet if those stones shine not in there
breast / whereby (as Ennius. says) men being doutfull of there matters what to
do / may be certefied / that they take not waight^ things rasshly in hand / we
acknowledge no stock nor succession off the Priesthood / nor all the rest off
the garments off Aaron. And seeing we have now in these times no other means to
be certified off the will off god besides his written word and the holy
scriptures: And seeing it is sure that this word is come in place off the Arck /
the Sanctuary / the brestplate off Judgment / and all the other ceremonies off
off the old law / even as those in old time were necessary for the priests / So
now is the understanding and knowledge heroff for the ministers off the word
off god. Therefore the Apostle Paul warns Timothe that a bishopp ought to be
able to teach. Whereas declaringe that he ought to be such / he speaks not
off it as off some help or orname^t / but as off the nature / matter and
substance off a Bishop^.

And that we may more full^ understand what the force off the word is and how
many things are contained under it / he declares it more at large in his
epistle to Titus / sainge / a Bishopp ought to besuche a one as holds fast
the faithful word according to doctrine / that he may be able also to exhort
with wholesome doctrine / and reprove them that speak against it. But how is it
possible that he should be able to exhort with sound doctrine unless he has
first learned that sound doctrine him selffe out off the holy scriptures? And
by what means can we convince those that speak against it / but by the
scriptures as it is rehearsed in the Acts that Apollos did? Act. 18.26. 2.
Timot. 4.2. 2. Timoth. 3.16. 1. Peter. ^.23. 1. Peter 2.2.
Finally how shall he be able to do that which Saint Paul commands Timothe
/ namely to enstruct / to teach to reprehend / reprove / and exhort but by
the Scripture? which as the same Apostle in an other place teaches Timothe are
able to furnishe the man off god that is to say the minister off his word to do
all these things according to his dewty. And seeing Saint Peter witnessethe
that we are begotten again into a new life by this seed and being borne are
norished and grow up by this milk / how can it be that any man with out this
seed should get children unto god / or norishe and bring up such as ar
begotten off other. Psalm. ^0^.105.
The kingly Prophet David does witness / that he knew not which way to go if
this lamp did not shine allwais before hi^ to direct him in the right way.

Therefore seeing the Ministers off the word are commanded to lead us in the
right way / They ought to be Torch bearers and to carry this light kindled in
there hand which may first give light unto them selves / and after also to those
off whom they have received charge to lead them in the wais off god. And off
this office off leadinge / guiding / and giving light / come those worthy names
and titles whereby they are called in the scriptures stars off the heaven / the
salt off the earth / the light off the world / and guides off the blind and
such like. Apocalip. 1.20. Mat. 5.16. Luke 6.39.
But unless these stars do shine / and unless a great deal off light be
first gathered into these Sons as there was in the first creation when the
Son was created to rule the day / if I say the son yt selffe be not first
lighted and kindled / It cannot shine to others / nor show the way by that
light it has not: Mat. 5.13.
so likewise yff the salt be unsavory wherewith shall a manseason yt. The like
may be said off these who are guydes of the blind: Mat. 15.14. Luke 6.39.
For as our savior says / if the blind lead the blind they must both fall
into the ditche.

And that we may more surely be persuaded off this doctrine / Let us consider
some other names and titles (for it were an infinite thing to gather all)
whereby there office and duty is declared. Saint Paul says that the mynister
is the Steward off god: 1. Cor. 4.2.
And adds in the same place / A disposer off the mysteries off god Therefore
both he ought to give meat to the lords household in dew time / and the
household must ask these Mysteries off the steward: As the Egyptians when they
came to the king in the famyn were sent by him / to his high steward that had
the disposinge off the corn. As it is also expressly said by Malachy the
Prophet / That the lips off the priest keep knowledge / and the law shall be
asked at his mouth. M^lach. 2.7.
Therefore this steward ought to be such an other as Joseph was: that has
gathered together great store of corn / and filled his barnes and granaries /
and stored the store house off his breast long before with these victualles /
that he may minister to the necessity and famine off the people. Mat. 13.^2.
And this is that scribe which the lord him selffe does witness to be made ready
for the kingdom off god / that is for the prechinge off the Gospel: that is
able to bring out off his store house / as the household shall have need both
new store and old.

To the Ephesians S. Paul says / that the pastor and the Doctor were given off
Christ / to the buildinge off his body as it were off the temple off god / that
this most noble frame and more marvelous the^ the most beautiful frame off
this world might the builded. Ephe. 4.12
But he that cannot tell how to handle the tools and instrumetes that he
should occupy for his buildinge / what his he able to do worthy the precious
foundacio^ whereupon he builds. The same Paul as he calls the the church
the Building of God / so he calls it his husba^dry: 1. Cor. 3.6.
which allthoughe it receives increase of the only blessinge off god / yet
there be some servants set to plant it and to water it / in respect of which
wateringe / in other places also they are compared to the heaven and to the
clouds and the doctrine with the rain and with the dew. Deuteronomy. 32.^.
But if these clouds be such as S. Jude speakethe off / Clouds without water:
Epistle. 12.
and this Heaven / such a one as the lord treatnethe in the law to his people
when they shall offend him / harder then any iron or steel / how shall the
field or heritage off the lord florishe or bring fourth fruit? Levi. 26.^^
But because it were an infinite thing to gather all the names off ministers
which are immunerable / let us leave the rest and consider only the name off a
Pastor and Shephard. For how many things are contained under this one name of
a Sheppard / how infinite a care and wonderful knowledge off diverse and sundry
things / namely that he keep the flock day and night eue^ with the danger of
his life from the wolves (wheroff S. Paul diligently warns the bishops off
the church of Ephesus / Act. 20.28.29.
that they feed the sheep / rule them with the shepehooke / call the^ by name
/ and lead the^ out to the wholesome pastures / and sweet run^ynge streams /
and after bring them to the fold again / which that Archpastor and chief
sheppard did fully and thoroughly parforme. Ioh. 20.4.9.11.16. Ezech. 34.4.
Zachar. 11.16.
Furthermore what lerninge were yt needful to have to do those things /
which Ezechiel and Zachary require off the Pastors? namely / to strengthen the
weak / to heal the sick and diseased / to bind the broken / and wind up those
that are bruised to seek those that are lost and to bring home again to the
fould those that go astraie. Therefore no man may be chosen to be Pastor or
sheppard off the lords flock but he that is endewed with these diverse and
manifold gifts whose voice may be insteade off a sheephooke to rule his sheep:
at the hearing wheroff they may go in and out: that knows what feadinge and
what waters is fittest for the flock: and finally that perfectly understands
how to help and heal the weak and diseased.

Neither let any man here complain that I am more severe and rigorous then
needethe / seeing that which Paul requires is nothing less / that is to say
to teach in sound doctrine / to raise up those that faint / to co^uict those
that resist / to strenghten those that shake and are fallinge / to break the
proud and stubburne / to allure the godly by hope of reward to all virtue and
honesty / and to terrify the wicked from sin / by menacinge and thretninges.

For / for the first point that is off doctrine / what a man (thinck we) ought
he to be / that ought to understand that he be able to teach those mysteries /
1. Pet. 1 12. 1. Tim. 3.16.
meruaillous to the Angels themselves / and unknown in the world not long
ago / off god manifested in flesh / justified in spirit / received up in
glory / and so forth as Paul most notably reherseth / and which (he declares)
that the good minister off Christ ought to teach unto the church. Furthermore
who but a learned man / and well taught and brought up in the school off Christ
/ is able to discern between sound and corrupt doctrine? and to give that as
most wholesome food and pleasant waters unto the flock / and that also fitly
aceordinge to the variety of diverse times? and of the other part to know and
perceive in time / and wisely to avoid / false and corrupt opynions or
foolish and vain questions which as the Apostle says like gangrenes do
freat to the ruin off the church. 2. Timoth. 2.17.
And does it not require a merueilous great diligence and singular knowledge in
the holy scriptures to prescribe all orders and degrees off men what they
ought to do / what is fit for every one and what every man's duty is? to
declare the dewty off kings and magistrates / to show the obedience off
subjects / to preach the law / the gospel / repentance / faith which S
Paul in Timothes person / prescribes all ministers to preach / and in the
person off the Auncientes off Ephesus / wherein taking to witness that he had
done so / exhorts them to follow him and to do the like? Acts. 20.17.
How hard a matter it is to stay those that are fallinge / by the comfort off
the promises / to refreshe and ease those that are weary and heavy laden / to
raise up them that are beaten down to the ground / as it were from the grave
again? These things had need off a heavenly kind off cun^inge and knowledge /
and off that learned tongue whereby Esaias witnesses that he refreshed those that
trauayled and were weary. Esai. 5.4.


But that I be not to long in this matter / and that I omit both many other
things / namely those devine and merueilous secreates off the election off the
faithful and reprobacion off the ungodly / how great is that one thing / to
be able to answer when he is asked in all matters / what the lords will and
pleasure is / and to be as it were the oracle off the church / which it is not
possible any man should be able to do / with out a great and excellent
knowledge off the word off god (which only is left to us in stead off the
Sainctuary / off the Arc and orakle off god under the law) no more then it
was possible to execute the priesthood with out Vrim and Thummim, Therefore
saying there is so great art required to the government off the church / and
saying as it is said by one in an other case that it is a piece off worck that
had need off many taklinges / helmes / and oars / no man ought to have the
guidinge heroff committed to him but he that is expert and co^ninge: neither is
it meet to set a boateman or a skoller to it. Who by reason off his ignorance
in the stars / if he were in the midst off the Sea / cold not tell where
aboutes he were / but should be compelled to cry as it is in the Poet.

O Syrs we know no east nor west.
where Son does rise or goes to rest.
It were more meet to set here to the government off the ship the con^ingest
master that ever was who lookinge to the word off god in stead off the north
star may bring it with straight and direct cuurse to the haven. Further it is
also to be considered in this question / that the case is touching the
government off the church / off feedinge of the flock off the lord / of keeping
Jerusalem the city off our god / off building the temple off god / off the
body off Christ / then the which there is nothing more to be esteemed in heaven
and earth. That we may the rather determine / that such a flock that has as
many goulden fleeces in it / as there be sheep / ought to be committed to the
keepinge off none / but off a most con^inge / painful and dilligent man / and
as it were an other Jacob. Genes. 3^.38.39.40.41. Luke 15.10.
For who is he that were able to answer the Lord for the loss off the lest
sheep off this flock? At whose bringinge to the fould again after it has
wandered and gone astray / saying the Aungelles are so gladd off and rejoice /
if it were lost would they not in a manner Lament / and would not heaven and
eaathe put upon them mourninge apparel for the same? yff then we commit this
flock unto a shepphard / that not only seeks not the lost sheep / nor binds
not that which is broken / but cannot if he would / how many would be lost /
and how greatly do we thinck that the lord off the flock will esteem so great
a loss? What would he say not only to the shepherdes but to his stewardes that
had set such a one over his flock. Ezec. 3^.6.
Surely all there Judgment is pronounced by Ezechiel / namely that both the
watchemen / that give not warninge off the enemies / and the city also that
seteth such watch men over them / shall be both taken and perish togeether:
Mat. 15 14 Luke 6.39.
and by our Savior Christ saying / that if the blind lead the blind / both
shall fall into the ditche.

Therefore saying the Bishopp must speak and preach off so heavenly matters by
reason off his office / Saying he is set over the government off the church off
god / Seeing that undoubted danger hangs over the head both off the minister
and church if such a one be chosen to rule that is not able / and saying off
the other part / all this fitnes and ability consists in holy knowledge off
the sacred doctrine and understanding off the word off God / I thinck it is
sufficiently proved that no man ought to be admitted Bishopp ot minister who is
not godly and learned.

And if any have been o^herwise by error admitted / to be put out again.
Math 5.13. Luke 14.34 35. Zach. 13.5.
For so our Savior Christ has allredy pronounced that the unsavory salt is to
be cast out off the doors / and the Prophet Zachary prophesied that it should
come to pass in the kingdom off CHRIST that they should willingly give over
that office again freely openly professinge / that they are in deed not
Prophets but husbandmen: and that from there you^h up they had never been
scholars unto the Prophettes / but Neathearedes. Porters shepherdes / seruinge
men and such like.

Which saying yt is so manifest and confirmed by so many Testimonies off the
Scripture that yt can not be denied / I merueile that ever yt could come to
pass in a Christian church / that so clear and express commandementes off
God / so proffitable for us and necessary for the salvation off the church /
should be broken and transgressed. But they are not only broken / and that
commonly and so offten / that for one fyt minister / a man may find a number
off unfit and unlearned / but excuses and prete^ces are sought to defend this
fault with all / as if in manner it were lawful to do so: And the most heinous
crimes that can be wants not there lawer and counsel to plead for them They
say that yt is evil in deed / but a necessary evil / and must needs be so
nor can not be otherwise / saying there be not so many learned men as ar able to
suffice for all the kingdom: So that the people must either want altogether a
minister or some must needs be admitted although they be not fit and able.
It should seem by this defense that all those that were learned and fit were
already placed throwout the churches: which how true it is / It may be seen
in both the universities / wherein there be many both off excellent godliness and
lerninge / which neither are called to the ministry / nor never shall be on
less they go for it / seek ambiciously after it / buy it and bargayne for it.

But let us put the case they were all placed abroad and that yet still many
churches wanted ministers: They ask us here what is to be done? I answer:
Surely even that which our Savior Christ commands his disciples to do where
the harvest was great and the laborers were few: Math. 10.38.
That is to say That we pray the Lord off the harvest that he would send out
laborers into his harvest. For every man may not be sent into the Lords feeld
to reap his corn because the harvest is great / But the Lord him selffe is to
be desired and prayed that he would have a care off his corn and provide
harvest men: who settethe no man to do his work that is not fit and able for
it. Therefore if we be towched with true compassion for the lords harvest
fearinge least if any storm come / it may sustain some damage / let us not
be carried away with a folishe pity / to provide for yt / as we think best:
(for what were this else / but to blame the lord / as negligent / and not
careful enoughe for his affairs) but let us keep that mean and measure
which our Savior has prescribed us) which is to commend unto the Lord his own
harvest by our earnest prayers.

And as all men must pray for it. So the Magystrate to whom god has committed
this charge is bound to provide workmen / as soon as is possible: They must
erect schools and collrdges: find and maintain teachers and readers / that
the youth may be taught and made fit for this work: finally they must bestow
all there care / thought / study and labor upon this that this golden harvest
may with all possible speed be provided for / to pray to god that he woold send
out workmen / for to pray to god that he would send out workmen / and not to
do the diligence for that place and calling whereunto thou art called / that
they may be sent / is not to pray / but to moke and tempt the lord.

Therefore such order is to be taken where by in these days the lord does
ordinarily send out his workmen / or such order being allredy well taken /
is diligently and carefully to be looked unto / that it be not neglected. And
surely it is not to be doubted / but the lord will bless our prayers and our
endeavors / and sent out fit worck men into his harvest. But in the mean time
until all may sufficiently be provided for / As it was practiced in the
Apostles time / men must come to the next churches where the word off god is
preached: and to those places where the churches are already established /
until such time as more may besett in order / which things if they were not
so clear and manifest / and if we had not so certain a rule to follow herein
/ yet what necessity is that / which ought to make us break the express
commandment off god / to set him over the church whom the lord has
forbidden? Is there (as off all other things) a time also to sin? or may we
do any thing against the good will and pleasur off God under pretense to help
and edify the churches / and are we not rather bownd to obey that everlasting
and most holy law: that no evil is to be done that good may come off it / and
seek for that that is good and honest by just and lawful means. Romans 3.8.
Deuteronomy. 16.20.
Although in deed the church is not helped by this means? but rather much
hindered / where that as / if they were sufficiently provided for already /
they care not / nor thinck any more off providing fit and worthy ministers and
preachers off the word off god.

But to the end we should not thinck but that they were careful for the church
/ they have found out a merueilous way / whereby appointing readers to read
some part of the scripture / and the prayers and the rest off the service /
they should be thought notwithstanding to make meet ministers and preachers off
the word off god. For they have made certain homilies off the creation / off
providence / off the dewty off the magistrate / off the obedience off the
subject / and other things / which they thought needful / which they charge
them to read to the people at certain times / supposing that by this means /
they remedy that evil off admitting those that be unworthy / which they say is
so necessary. A marvelous strange remedy and never hard off in the church in
the Apostles time / and which not only amendethe not the fault but makes it
greater / and most like to the piece that our Savior Christ speaks off in the
gospel whereby the rent is not amended but made a great deal worse. Mat. 9.16.
For who may arrogate this unto him to have his writings rehearsed read and
propounded unto the church / Is not this proper to god only that his word be
read in the church / and ought not the voice off god alone to sound and to be
hard in the church?

But they say these ar holy meditations to good manners taken out off the
scriptures and written by great and worthy men: why then do they not read also
the holy meditations off Augustine / Chrysostom and other great men? why not
also the eccesiasticall history which contains infinite examples off singular
virtue for men to follow? By which means at the last the lord shall be pulled
out off his throne / that (as we saw it come to pass in that egyptiacall
darcknes off popery) men may sit in his place. What then say they / shall we
take away al interpretation off the word off god? shall only the writings off
the Apostles and prophets be read / and shall not the holy doctrine be more
fully expounded: Shall there be no exhortations nor reprehe^sions as the times
off the church shall give occasion? yes verily: for I have declared above /
that such a one is to to be chosen minister / that is able to exhort with
sownd doctrine and to convince those that speak against it / and do suppose
this to be the especial dewty off a lawful Pastor to apply the word of god
to this church / as time and occasion shall serve / but to bring in other
writings into the church which co^teine either general doctrine / or holy
meditatio^s / and are not applied to the special use off the church as being
such which are common to all churches and to all times / I think it is no more
lawful / the^ to translate the glory off god unto men. And if they declare the
creation of the world in there homelies / the duties of all sorts and degrees
off me^ / why do they not rather declare it out of Moses and the writings of
the Prophets and Apostles / then out of there book off homelies? Therefore a
worthy Bishop or minister is to be chosen that can interpret the holy
scriptures / and apply it as occasion shall serve to the use and necessity of
the church: not a reader to rehearse other men's sayings and writings by whose
ignorance the church of god may be in danger of there salvation.

They have found out also an other remedy for this disease which is as ill as
the disease it self: They give them leave to go to the university / and to
tarry there for three years that after they have been diligently occupied for
that time in the readinge / hearing / and meditati^ge of the scriptures / They
may return again better furnished for the teachinge of the church. But what
shall be come of the miserable churches in the mean time if they be left as
ships without takle and furniture / and without a governor for the space of
three years fletyng upon the Seas? It is not to feared that they shall be drowned
or broken / or overwhelmed or synke / being subject to so many dangers of
Pirates / of rokes / of gulfes / swallows / sands / storms and tempests?
And why are they wise to late in this point / and do not rather send them first
to the university to learn / before they begin to teach? And what an after
wit is this to appoint hi^ to teach who must after learn even in the pulpit?
True it is we can never sufficiently profit in the scriptures / and that the
best learned of all ought continually and diligently to read and study them /
whereby they may increase there strenght and ability for the discharge of there
duties / as we read that both S. Paul exhorted Timothy to do / and it
appears by the parchementes he sent for to Rome that he did so him self. 1.
Timot. 4.13. 2. Timo. 4.13.


But this is it that I reprove and find fault with all / that they admit such
to the office off a Bishop / that is to say unto the ministry and expoundinge
off the word / who are altogether unmeet / who understand not the scriptures
/ and who take upon them the place to teach / before they have learned. The
lord contrariwise would have his will perfectly known to his Prophets before
he send the^ out to prophecy in his name. Which is set forth in the third
chap. of the prophesye of Ezechiel and the x. of the revelation of S. John
under a pretty similitude of eatinge / concoctinge and disgestinge the book and
turninge it in a manner into there own substance and blood. ^s^. 9.4.
So also the Prophet David witnessethe that he laid to his ear to understand
the parable before that he went about to sing it and play it upon the
instrument in the hearing of all estates of people: declaringe thereby that men
ought first thoroughly to understand that which they will take upon them to
utter unto others. But this is the nature and property of that which is evil
/ That being once let go it cannot be s^aide but daily breeds and brings
forth many other euilles.

Therefore let us return unto the wais of the lord and be obedient to his most
just and holy laws and ordinances: and decree that no man be admitted
minister or Bishopp who is not so well studied in the holy scriptures before /
that he is able also to utter it both purely and sincerely and faithfully to
the profit and edification of the church. For it is not sufficient that he be
not dombe in the church / but he ought also reuere^tlie to handle the holy
scriptures / and as S. Peter gives warninge so v^ter them as the word and
oracles of god / that (as S. Paul warnethe Timothy he may show him self a
worckman that needs not be a shamed of his labor. ^. Peter, 4.^^. ^. Timot.
^.19. 2. Corr. 3.1^. 2. Timot. ^.^3
Not such as the same Apostle writes to have been among the Corinthes that
build straw / and stubble (which the Lord will consume to there loss) upon the
precious foundation / but in a word / that they may rightly divide the word of
truth.

Neither am I purposed / here to appointe any manner off making of sermons /
but generally to declare that doctrine is to be referred to the edifyinge of
the church / and that the holy scriptures are to be expounded simply / and
sincerely / and uttered with reverence. For some to show them selves to the
people to be learned / stuff there sermons with diverse sentences out off
Philosophers / Poets / Orators / and scholemen / and of the ancient fathers /
Augustine / Hierome and others / and these often times rehearsed in greek or
latin: by which pieces sometime ill fauoredly pached together / they seek and
hunt for commendation / and to be esteemed learned of the people / which also
some do that are unlearned: I call them unlearned touching the knowledge of the
scriptures / who taking upon them to teach and having not there minds well
practiced with the word off god / no nor as the Apostle says there senses well
exercised / but allwais have been occupied in readinge ethnic writers / they
bring forth to the people off that store which they have gathered to gether /
and play rather the Orators and Philosophers then Prophets and interpreters off
the holy scripture. Heb. 5.19.


Other some use I know not what strange kind off interpreting / and pervert
the true and natural sense off the scriptures with allegories / and foolish
and old wives tales / which Paul admonishes Timothy and Titus / are to be
avoided. 1. Timo. 1.4. Tit. 3.9.
Therefore a great care and respect ought to be had herein that the party which
is to be chose^ / be first heard speak by the chosers that they may know how
he expounds the scriptures before they admit hi^ to the ministry off the
word and the office off a Bishopp. And thus much for the learinige off him that
is to be chosen minister:

Now let us go foreward to other things. For the Apostle thought it not
enoughe that a minister should be able to teach / who for the merueilous care
that he had off the church / took great heed that there were no danger secretly
hid in some part that might hurt the church / especially in that which this
building staid upon as a pillar. Therefore he gives warninge to take heed /
that a Bishopp and minister be no new vpstart in religion / newly drawn out
off Idolatry and superstition: which when it comes to pass must needs be
joined with great damage and loss off the church. For when a minister or
teacher off the word off god does fall / who as I have said is as it were a
pillar off the church / or some off the most chifest beams whereon the building
does stay / It must needs be that they which stay upon him being shaken with
the same wind should fall to together with it.

Therefore our master Builder wisely and conningly forbids to use these
yonnglinges and startvppes to the buildlnge off the house off god / as grene
wood which have not yet swett out there moisture / nor are seasoned by the
weather / so that it is to be feared lest that they might be occasion by there
shrincking / off the ruin and falling off the buildinge. 1. Timoth. 3.6.
Therefore they provide ill both for the church / and also for the parties them
selves to whom being such they give this office / that receive into the
ministry such as scarcely are crept out off superstition and Idolatry and
make them captains and guydes in the camp off the lord off hosts / that are
scarcely to be received for sold yers: and prefere to the highest dignities
off the Christian common wealth / those with are scarcely made free from the
intolerable servitude and bondage off Popery. Whereupon it comes often times
which Dionysius Halicarnaffeus witnesses to have happened to the Romain common
wealth) that we see unclean cappes in the highest places: And many (as
Socrates in Plato complainethe off Athens) take in hand the government off the
church / who have yet there servants hear growinge still in there minds: that
is to say whose servile and slauishe conditions do still remain.

And suerly we above others have more cause to complain off so shameful an
abuse / who perceive at the last / to our great cost / how great a matter it is
to have neglected this holy wisdom off the Apostle: For if any thing else /
surely this has been a great hinderance to the establishing off discipline in
our church / That these new vpstartes in religion being peeferred to the
ministry and to the highest places / were loathe to be brought from that kind
off life whereunto they had been off long time accustomed: Being acquainted
with a profitable and gainful priesthood / they abhorred the mean estate off
the ministry: being delighted with the pompous show off the ambitious
Hierarchy and prelacy off the Romish church / they cold not away with the
severity and rigor off the reformed Religion. And having used many years /
so many ceremonies and trifles and all that stagelike show off the Papacy /
which seemed to the^ to carry a goodly gloss off majesty and honor they
despised the simplicity off the gospel.

How much better therforr were it and fitter for the edification off the church
/ if these beams had been suffered to have swett out there iewse and moisture
and had not been occupied so green in the buildinge off the house off god /
whereby they threaten some fear off fall and ruin? we leave not so easylie our
acquaynted kind off life: especially if it be joined with idolatry and
superstition which is borne together with us and which we suf with our nurses
milk. The remembrance and longing for off our old kind off life comes often
to our minds / so that it is needful to use great labor and diligence to the
chaunginge off the wholl state off off our life. Deuteronomy. 1^.12.1^.
Therefore the Lord commanded in the law that if any man had saved the life off
a woman off any off the idolatrous nations being taken prisoner in the war
and had a mind to marry her / being converted to the faith / that he should
grant her first a certain time to bewail her country / her parents and her
frindes and see that she should shave her hedd and pare her nails / and put
off the garment that she was taken and finally that he should first suffer her
in a manner to be buried touching her former life / and to be raised up again
into a new life and profession / and as it were to be newborn again off
other parents and in a new country / before he joined him selffe with her or
took her to be his wife / how much more ought they that are to be made
masters and teachers off a new religion (especially having been priests and
teachers of idolatry before) to have been suffered first to have bewailed
there old liuinges ease profit and commodities? For how often thinck we do
they remember the commodities off there former life? And how often there old ease
/ pomp / and estimacion with no less longing for / then if it were for there
country and for there pare^tes? And as for there hear it is rather to be let
grow then to be shaven / for this they were accustomed to.

But the garment they were taken in should have been changed and there
raueninge nails pared whereby they were wont to / take and scrape on every side
unto them selves: finaly we should have let the^ first in a manner to have died
/ that after as it were by a new birth they might have bee^ borne again off
new pare^tes and in an other contry. For if he has been at any time not only
an idolater / but also master and a teacher off it / much more head is to be
taken in this case / and so much the more carefully and painfully must he be
cleansed and purged / how much more fowly he def^led him selffe with all kind
off filthe and uncleanness: for so the law off god does comaund washing and
cleansing to be used according to the kind off the pollution and uncleanness.
For he is more easelie purified and cleansed that had only touched the vessel
or garment off an unclean person then he that was infected with leprosy / for
the leprous man eue^ after the disease was healed / yet was he not suffered to
enter in^o his tent / for seven days. Nombe. 12.14. Le^i. 14, 8.
And after when it appeared manifestly that he was recovered yet was he shaven /
washed / and purified.

But what more foul and shameful leprosy can there be then that popis he
priesthood? So that in this case / we ought to use no less labor in cleansing
and purging then in the other yea so much more / by how much the leprosy off
the mind is greater then the leprosy off the body. Therefore this leprous
priest allthoughe he were cured and healed / yet is he to be separated from
other men / and to be shutt up for a time / both for the shame off so filthy a
disease / and for fear it break not out again to the danger off others.
After / if it appear in deed that he is recovered he must put off his clothes
and be washed / shaven and purged by sacrifice.

Off which so diligent purginge and cleansing / the papists the^ selves put us
in mind whereas they (to honor there priesthood when they disgrade any off there
priests) make him put off his cope or vestiment / his surples / or albe / his
square cupp and his other garments / that were polluted with leprousy / they
pare his nailys and raze his crown lest peradventure there should some
infection yet secretly lie hid in those places where his disease first appeared:
This there diligence and labor / we ought to have followed in the convicted
Popish priesthood / and have taken all the garments from yt / and not only
washed them seeing the leprousy had spread it selffe even upon them / but as the
law prescribethe to have burnt them. Le^^. ^5.52


The nails theroff should have been pared and (which thing only we did as we
ought) the crown rased least that any moisture or fatnes off that oil might
remain. Then we should not have had at this day so great co^tencion for there
filthy garments. But it has come to pass by the ignorance off the priests
(when they were nor able to Judge according to the law / what were clean and
what were unclean / and thought that the leprosy had not spread it selffe upon
the garments) that they have not condemned them to be burned / but to be
washed only: the filthe wheroff no art or conninge off the fuller is able to
wash away. But this in the way off digression / yet I trust not unprofitably.

Now let us return to our purpose: and conclude that for such causes as have
been alleged / we ought to obey the Apostles decree touching these Novices and
grene kinghtes: and not admit them to ministry off the word. And these are
those things which are required off a fit Bishopp / and which especially the
posers and examiners ought to have respect unto.

For whereas the old Canons require that he be off a certain age / surely the
choosers ought wisely to consider off it: for it is not almost possible / but
by the singular and especial grace off off god / that youth should be so well
ordered and governed / that the want off years appear not in some youthful
trick or ^oy that may dishonest the sacred office: notwithstanding seeing the
Apostle gives no precept nor commandment touching age / yea rather
forbiddethe any man to condemn and despise Tymothi and Titus for there youth /
godly and learned young men are not to be kept back from this office. For
somtymes these first fruits are consecrated to god and then commonly they are
more holy then the rest off the lompe. And as the Poeth says.

Some times on young men's heads, does grow the hoary hear:
Before by nature yt be time, for them such crown to wear.
That is to sey / They have hoarie hears off godliness and holiness / yea and
sometimes also hoary knewledge as it appears in certain notable examples off
Daniel. Thimothy and Titus and some other which are worthy examples for young
men to follow / often times also they are more inflamed and set on fire with
that heavenly fire off the zeal off god then other. And I know not how / but
these first fruties off the spirit are oftentimes more holy / and these first
begotten guiftes off the holy ghost are more strong and mighty. And thus
much off the particular election off bishops and ministers.

Now let us begin a new and speak of there ordinatio^ / I said before that
all the offices of the church are to be ordained and appointed to certain places
and persons / where and among whom there may exercise there office. 1. Timot.
5.17.18.
But the orderinge off bishopes has this thing particular in our times (for
whereas in times past this was common to them with the rest off the ancie^tes /
that was for a singular respect and especial occasion off that time) that off
there apointinge and ordinacion to a certain place and flock which they ought
diligently to defend and look unto / certain profit and commodities do depend /
whereof they may live and whereby they may be sustained and norished: wheroff I
shall need to speak more at large that all men may understand that they are
bound by the commandment off god to perform this dewty to there bishops and
ministers and that I may repress the couetones of some me^ which have never
enoughe.

And first off all we must remember here that which was proved before / that
bishops that is so say ministers ought to give the^ selves continually to
prayer and to the administracion off the word: Act. 6.4.
and not suffer them selves to be called from doing that there dewty by any
office be it never so honorable / either in the church or in the common
wealth. For these idle bellies that wildo none of there dewty / ought also to
have no dewty done to the^ again / but they are rather to be dealt with as
Paul commands the Thessalonians to deal with those that live disorderly that
is say / that / They that labor not should not eat. 2. These. 1.^^
But and if they be such as do there dewtie / and refuse to deal with the
affairs off the common welche (the handlung where off might be honorable unto
the^) for the churches cause / how great wrong were it to suffer such men to be
pore an needy / and compelled ^o seek there living by some ha^die crafft or
occupatio^ whereby they should be no less hindered from doing there duties / then
by the honorable charges of the common welthe. And sei^ge they are day and night
careful for the church / and setting all other things a side wholly thinck
how they may defend it / and promote the salvation theroff / what can be more
just or equal / then that they again should not be neglected off those for
whose cause they take so great pains. 1. Cor. 9.^
For who did ever (as S. Paul notably handlethe this matter to the
Corinthia^s) go to warfare of his own charges? who pla^tethe a vineiard and
eatethe not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock and eatethe non off
the milck off it? But the church has many mortal enemies and continual
war with them without any peace or truce / and the bishops be they that take
upon them and sustain these enmyties for the churches cause / and strive to
there very great danger for the salvation theroff with most mighty princes and
potentares / as S. Paul callethe them and the monarche and prince off this
world. Ephesians. 6.1^^
For how often thinck we even for this cause are they assaulted / because there
defend the church? how many dangers do they put them selves into and with
what fiercnes thinck we does the enemies pursue the^ / knowing that many ar
preserved by there life? Therefore they that would suffer this there soldier or
captain to die for hunger / were they not worthy to fall into the hands off
there enemies? And what vineiard is there so painfully trimmed and dressed off
the husband man / as the churches are dressed of there husband me^? how
careful are they in plantinge? what pains take they in pruninge and culting
often / and other such like toil and labor? if the^ being so well dressed it
should not norishe the husband man that dressed it / might they not worthelie
complain off it / as the lord by the prophet Esaias after an other sort
complainethe off his vine? Esai. ^.
Saying also there is nothing more reasonable then that the shepherd should
feed off the milk of his flock should not those shepeherdes be fed which
the milk / and clothed with the flece and wolle of there flocks who sustain
for the flocks cause the assaults of most grievous wolves / and watch forthe^
day and night / Act. 10.^^
suffering the parching heat and chillinge cold for there cause / who feed the^
ouersee the^ and seek the^ and often times put there life in extreme danger to
defend them.

Nether are these things spoken and grounded only upon human and natural
reason or handled according to man's Judgment only / but this is Gods
ordinance and appointment: 1. Cor. 9.9 Deuteronomy. 25.4
and groundeth upon that law which forbids to mussel the ox that treadethe
out the corn. For god in making that law had not so great respect to oxen and
beasts as he had to men: For he teaches us thereby that the ploughe man may
confort him selffe in his troblesome labor with the hope off fruit: And that
the harvest man ought to be partaker off his hope: And finally that every man
ought to live off his labor. 1. Corr. 9.13.
Yea futher the Apostle plainly addethe that as they that ministered the holy
things under the law did live also off the holy things / and they that
served the Altar / were partakers of the offeringe off the altar So the lord
did also appoint it that they which preach the Gospel should also live off
the Gospel.

1. Timoth. 5.13.
And in the fifth chap. off his first Epistle to Tymothy he alledgethe both these
Testimonies: that off the law / and this off the Gospel in the same place to
prove / that the Elders that do rule well are to provided for: for says he /
it is in the Scripture / Thou shall not mussel the ox that treadethe out the
corn: and again / The worckman is worthy off his wages. For so the
Evangelists do rehearse / that The Lord when he sent out his Apostles to
preach the Gospel and commanded them not to be careful for there meat or
apparel / told the^ that the workma^ is every were worthy off his hire: Mat.
10.10. Luke 10.7.
and Therefore into what cyty so every they should enter / if there were any man
worthy / he co^mandethe them to go to his house and to tarry there / until
they depart / upon which ordinance off god in the old law / and off Christ
in the new Testament the Apostle growndinge / ordained in the church off the
Galathians that he that was instructed in the word off God / should communicate
all his goods with him by whom he had been instructed. Galat. 5.6.
Galat. 5.7.8.
And further addethe (as one that did forsee the manifold pretenses whereby
covetous men notwithstanding this law would go about to defraude them and
mock the Lord) that the lord cannot be mocked: declaring that it shall come to
pass that if they do not sow to the Spirit / but sow all there seed to the
flesh / they should not look at all to reap everlasting life off the spirit
/ but corruption and destruction off the feeld off the flesh wherein they had
so plentifully sowed and scattered. wheroff I thinck it is manifest that the
Bishopp ought to be liberally provided for by the churches / lest they be
compelled most injuriously by reason off there need and poverty to distract
there studies / and to be hindered in the doing off their dewty by exercising
off other occupacions: which cannot be otherwise / (if they need) saying they
/ as well as other men / are commanded by the Apostle / to norishe and to look
to there family / and as well as other to be esteemed infidells by the Apostles
precept / if they provide not for there own / especially for there own
household. 1. Timoth. 5.8.


And allthoughe it be not easy to set a certain rate how they should be
provided for / by reason off the great diversity off times and persons / yet
generally it may be said that we ought not to deal with them sparingly
couetously / and pinchingly / but contrariwise friendly / gently and liberally.
For if we have received the gospel off Christ with that mind we ought / we
will also make much off the ministers off the same / which mind and affection
Paul him selffe testifiethe that the Galathians had toward him / who says
that he was received off them as an Angel off God / yea as Jesus Christ him
selffe: So that they were ready to have bestowed there goods / yea (if it had
been possible) to have plucked out there own eyes to have do^ne him Good.
Therefore it is plain enoughe off that which has been said that Bishops
that is to say the mynisters / ought to have an honest reasonable and comodious
living to maintain them / that they may more freely apply them selves to
there vocation and calling.

But this heavenly / holy / and most righteous law / as it is transgressed by
the pomp and superfluecry off a few / So much more by the want and need off
a great nombre which surely is so great / that I am ashamed to speak off it:
yet It must needs be spoken / and the disease disclosed and freely declared
what and how great it is / that we may think and be careful to provide some
speedy remedy allthoughe I am afraid that the disease already be so great /
that in vain may we seek for remedy and give Medycine to that which is past
remedy / which Hyppocrates forbiddethe. For what remedy may be found in so
trobled and confused a state / where yt wantethe not much that the ministers go
a begginge / as in times past the Popish Priests were wont to do? And they
that are charged in many places with the cure off the church are almost in
worse condition then any hired seruanntes then shepherdes / or laboringe men?
who besides there meat and drinck / have some thing given them to carry home
toward the norishment off there house and famylie / whereas the Teachers off
many churches / have scarcely to find them meat and drinck.

The cause off which shameful beggary / is a certain profane ungodliness /
joined with an insatiable covetousness / whereby many neglectinge Religion / the
service off god and the salvation off men / look to there own proffit only and
rake to them selves all that they can with out respect off right or wrong. So
that they had rather all Religion were banished / that all opynion off
worshipping and fearing god were abolished / that all faith in Christ and hope
and looking for everlasting life were forgotten among men / then to
maintain it with any penny off there is. Yea further they will not only give
nothing to the mayntenance off the Ministry / (which being in good estate /
the other fonamed virtues do florishe / and likewise fall away by the ruin
theroff) But most unjustly scrape unto them selves that which was liberally
given by others / and spoil the church / robbing her off her goods. For how
many churches be there which sometimes wereable to have maintained sufficiently
and honestly a godly and learned man to teach them the gospel / which now are
scarce able to find a reader and service saier / by reason that those goods
are taken away by impropriation as they call it / (that is to say by an
improper and no right title) and distributed into many parts: wherein we show
our selves more barbarous / covetous / and ungodly / then all nations have done
from time to time / which have allwais been careful and are to this day / for
mainteininge among them the manner that god ought to be served by / and with
all to keep and maintain there priests.

So we read in Genesis that Pharo provided for the Priests off Egypt. Genes.
47.^2. 1. King. 18.19.
And in the story off the kings / that Iesabell provided for the Priests off
the groves and that with such love care and affection / that four hundred off
them were norished at her table. And Pharo when the rest off the Egyptians for
famyn were compelled / to sell there flocks and droues and even there lands and
possessions for corn / until that are the last all the country by this means
was come into the kings hands / he suffered not the priests to sell theirs
neither would he increase his treasure by there loss and hinderaunce / But
contrariwise ordained that they should be provided for / geuinge them even that
which was his own. So likewise all other nations and kingdoms provide for
there priests and Religious men and think that god would be grievously offended
with them if they should neglect them.

And we see how beneficial and liberal Papists were to the mainteininge off
Idolatry and superstition / for yt is almost incredible what cost they made
upon there Idolatry and that show and shadow off Religion / which they had /
And how costly and sweet odors they bestowed as it were upon the dead corpse
off Christ? But we forsake him alive and raised up again. So that it is to be
feared / that he will one day vpbraide us with his poverty / and need / and
complain that we left him naked / hungry thirsty and forsaken without help or
succor. But he is not only forsaken / being naked / But even robbed off that
apparel which he has: So that yt apperethe that some men thought to crucify
him again when they thus parted his garments among them and cast lottes for
his coat. But allthoughe there be many ways off spoilinge / yet me thinck none
more grievous then impropriation / (the only name wheroff / declarethe how little
right there is in it) which is the translatinge and the alienatinge off the
goods off some church / to an other that has no right unto them.

But saying this wholl matter off the most unworthy spoilinge and robbinge our
church is fully handled by that worthy and learned man Master Bucer in that
book off his which I named in the beginning / and seeing that in the same
book / he handlethe not only impropriacions / but also first fruits which is
a certain kind theroff / presentacions / collacions / resignations / and diverse
other kind off robberies / I had rather these things were sought for in the
learned wrightinges off that worthy man / that the matter might carry more
credit and authority with it. As for me I lament with him this miserable state
of our church / which almost in every place is destitute off fit Pastors and
ministers / seeing no man is willing to take that condition whereby after he
has taken never so great pains / he shall be scarce able to maintain his
life. Neither is it destitute only at this present time but it is to be feared
/ that it is alwais like to be so here after / and that the study off god his
word shall be neglected. For no man will willingly follow that trade off life /
wherein he has only no hope to live honestly and with some commodity / but
wherein (besides the infinite travel / and greefes that follow that profession)
he shall be afflicted also with need and poverty.

And if we had not rather be wise by our own damage and loss then by other
men's / there ruyns off the churches round about us might sufficiently teach us
/ how dangerous this spoilinge off the churches good is / and this neglect
off mainteninge the holy ministry. Therefore if we provide not otherwise / let
us assure our selves that even this fault does threate^ the undoubted ruin off
the church / and that so worthy gestes as the preachers off the gospel cannot
long tarry in an In^e / where they be so ill received and interteined. And if we
compel them to leave us / surely they will take away wi h them that peace and
blessinge which they brought / and which we may truly profess came into
England with them. Therefore let us not so lightly esteem the great care that
the Lord has over us / in feeding / ouerseinge / and rulinge us by his
servants / lest at the last he break his shepherdes hook in his anger and
cast away all care over us / and go his way: and lest that being provoked
with this thirty pence (a notable hire that we pay him) he leave us and depart
in his anger (as some times he threatened the Jews) not caringe any more
whither the broken be bound up / or the lost be sought again. Zach. 11.12
13.14.16.


Therefore let us at the last amend this shameful neglect off the ministers off
the word off god: and saying as the Apostle says / they sow spiritual
things to us and such as belong to everlasting life / let us not thinck
much if they reap carnal things off us again / and some commodities off
this present life, 1. Cor. 9.11
yea rather saying this is a most gainful husbandry for the church / off this
so vile seed to reap those most precious fruits off the Spirit / Love,
Peace, Joy, Galat. 5.22
Long Suffering, Goodness, Faith, Meeknes Temperance, and at the last that
golden harvest off life everlasting / let us sow plentifully and with good
courage that we may reap a more plentiful harvest. Galat. 6.9
Neither let us now be more weried with sowinge / whiles it is sowinge time /
then we will be weary hereafter when harvest shall come / in reapinge and
gatheringe most precious fruit into our barnes. Therefore let us embrace the
ministers off the gospel with all love / kindness and duty / and that so much
the more liberally and plentifully / for that what so ever is bestowed upon
them even to a dishe off cold water / shall not only be much more richely
requited and reco^pensed again but accounted even as it had been bestowed off
Christ him selffe. Math. 10.41.42.
But we ought not only to lay our clothe and spread our Table for Christ whom
we have bidden unto us (as Simon the Pharisie did in S Luke) (if we would have
him know that he is well come to us and that we Luke 7.
love him with great affection) but also embrace him and kiss him and wash
his feet with water / and anoint his head with oil / and finally to receive
with all service and duty so worthy a guest / as both becomes his honor /
and also is meet for the great love we bear unto him. And this is the dewty
off all men. But kings that are wont to receive no man off any countenance or
estimation but honorably and with great magnificence / and there Equalles with
more princely port and stately manner / how ought they to take heed that they
be not to pinching and to sparinge when they receive Christ the Lord (the king
off heaven and earth / off whom they as Vasselles hold there kingdoms / and
lordshippes as off see) nor commit any thing that may offend so noble and
worthy a guest and rather be careful that all things here be magnificall /
gorgeous and princely.

But I would not that any man should thinck I say thus as if I thought under
pretense off Christ nothing cold be to much that were bestowed upon Bishopes
and ministers / or that I would have them made drunk with the delights and
pleasures off this world / who ought to be an example to other men off
continency / frugalitie / and all moderacion off life / but only that I would
have them received as the embassadores off Christ / for the honor off there
master / honestly and liberally / that we put not the^ down to the meany / to
eat with the shepherdes and hired servants / nor forget those that labor in
the Lords worck / as Moses gave the Jews warni^ge / towchinge the Levites /
seeing we sit all of us by the blessinge of the Lord quietly and in peace every
man under his Olive tree and under his vine / and gather in our hauest and our
vintage: saying I say we enjoy these commodities we ought not to deal
couetously / sparingly / and niggardly with them / but lovingly liberally and
bountifully that they may live honestly and co^modiously off there labors / that
they may norishe and maintain there house and family / that they may provide
them selves such necessary helps as they stand in need off for there vocation
and calling / yea and further that they may be able to releive and succor the
pore and ^eedy / for this is the right way to preserve the ministry / that
both it become not vile and conte^ptible thorowghe poue^^y and misery /
neither that it wax wanton an profane by great excess and abundance. For as
it is a shame for the churches to see there minister in misery / thoroughe
need and necessity / so it is to be feared lest they wax wanto^ by to great
plenty and riches.

For surely it was a right heavenly voice and spoken as an Oracle off the manner
off gouerninge the church which the story of the primitive church reherseth was
hard from heaven in the time off Constantine the great that godly Emperor that
is to say / that the church was poisoned with riches. For so it came to pass
that they fell from labor to idleness / from te^perancie to excess and
wantonness / from the mean estate off bishopes and ministers to affect and
desire to imitate and follow the magnificence and majesty off lords and
princes / hereof come the there silver and gilted Crosiers whereby they imitated
the sceptres off kings: heroff they got them myters: as kings have there
crowns: hereoff also because the noble men kept great trains of servants that
they might be the beter able to serve the common wealth in time off need / they
would also have there trains and began to be delighted and to take pleasure in
an unprofitable number off servants and waitinge men: to adorn and set out
there cuphordes with silver vessel and plate off gold / to array themselves in
costly apparel / (for now a dais a man may see them that wear soft apparel
not only in kings courts / as our Savior Christ said but eue^ in the
church) to be called honorable lords / to sit at the right hand off kings and
princes / to send them gifts and presents: Mat. 11.^.
to bid the^ to there bancketes and both seek and maintain there honor and
estimation / by a certain courtly pomp and show. This condition I not only
wish not to our Bishops / but judge it and esteem it altogether
intolerable and by no means to be suffered as a means to hindre there labor
and diligence in there office / as a means to make them wanton / lascyuious /
and proud / and agreathe not with that mean estate that ought to appear in
Bishopps / but is most contrary both to the ordinance and also to the examples
off Christ our Savior and off his Apostles.

Neither in my Iudgmen^ may any church be esteemed well enoughe reformed / that
even in this behalffe does not obey to the express commandment off god and
take away all this vain pomp and show / and make the Bishops be content
with the mean estate off there place and calling: making them able to bid
the pore to there table / and the banished for Christ's sake / but not to bidd
kings and princes: calling them the servants and Ministers off Christ / and
not honorable lords: being careful that they may be such as may shine in
godliness learning / modesty temperaunce / continency and all example of good
life: not with gold and silver / with trains and trompes off me^ / and lordly
port and courtly state off honor. These are the right ornaments off Bishoppee
whereby they may procure to the^ selves / an honest report / with credit and
authority in the church off god to there ministry / wherbie also they mvy
preserve and mayntene the same Therefore let us not take to much pleasure in
the outward beauty and fair show off this pomp and glory / but let us see
if there be any use and proffit off it / desire rather that which is
proffitable for others / then that which seruethe only for avaine show. For as
the Poet says / Seek not the thing that fair is to eye:
But rather that, the cyty may live by.
But the church lives not by this pomp and show / nor has no need off it:
but off godliness / lerninge / symplicitie and modesty / by which things Christ
would have his kingdom enlarged.

And I pray you how do this move the minds off men / to go to the church with
a great train off men before him and after him: as the Bishop that Eusebius
speaks off in the seventh book off his ecclesiastical history / to go to
the pulpit with officers before him making Room for my lord / to preach in a
Rochet and a fair square cappe / leaninge opon a quishion off clothe off gold?
These things may delight the eyes for a time and the outward senses take
pleasure in this vain show / but I see not how the mi^d is more easily
taught / beaten down / or raised up again by this means. For it must be a
certain heavenly power joined with a pure / learned and simple interpretation off
the scriptures which must work these things / which are Jewels more meet to
shine in a pulpit / than silver or gold.

Pliny shewinge the cause off the fruitfulnes off the Roman feeldes in times
past / more elegantly in deed then truly / Then (says he) when the fields
were tilled by Emperors / it is like that the earth reioysed to be plowed with
a share bearing a laurel garlond upon it / and to be tilled off such a plow
man who had before triumphed. More prettily I say then truly / for that it is
better for tilli^ge off the earth / that the ploughe share be sharp / then
that it be crowned with a laurel garlond and that the ploughe man be diligent
rather then such a one as had entered the city in great pomp and triumph.
Which also the same Author correctinge him selffe adds after in the same
place / saying / Or else this might have been the cause off the fruitfulnes
off the feeldes the^ / That those worthy Captains and Emperors handled there
seeds as carefully as there battelles / and were as diligent over there fields
/ as over there tents. Or else this / That all things speed more happily
which are done by them who are honest and virtuous / because they be also done
more painfully and with greater travel / which surely me thincketh is the very
cause off the fruitfulnes off the lords field. And that then it yeldeth the
best fruit / and as it were a golden harvest / when it is diligently /
carefully and painfully labored and tilled / when there is a great and a
careful heed taken off the seeds / when the churches are looked unto with as
great diligence as the camp and army is watched in the feeldes: And finally
when they are labored by honest men. For neither does the grownde respect the
laurel garlonde upon the ploughe share nor whither the plowe man wears rich
and costly embroidred garments / but would have him painful / laborsome /
diligent and full off travel: neither does the church look for this outward
pomp and show in her bishopp / but for faith / diligence / labor / good and
precious seeds / honest / busy / and painful hands / and had a great deal
rather have her husband man godl / y learned and diligent / then mitred and
Rocheted. Whereupon it comes to pass that when the feelde off Rome was plowed
and tilled by Seranus / and Cincinnatus and such like worthy men / and the
church by Paul and Peter / and such like / The increase was very plentyfull:
but now as far as we are gone from there example and pains taking / so much
are our churches behind and inferior to the feeldes off Ephesus and Antioche.

Therefore it is the deuty off all godly bishops who desire to serve the
church / and to be well esteemed in it rather for there godliness and learning
/ then for this pomp and show / seeing they have already declared that the
gospel is dearer unto them then all the commodities off this life / that if
they will discharge there dewty / they would better fynishe and make perfect that
which they have allreadie well begonn / and even willingly for the rest off
the gospel / which yet we want touching discipline / once again leave and
forsake that pompous state and dignity and be more careful for the glory off
god / the salvation off the church / and keepinge a god conscience unto them
selves / then for keepinge or mainteininge this false show off honor and glory
and the vain names off titles and dignities / and return again to the
work off the ministry and not (as in a sense somewhat diverse from this the
Apostle warnethe the Galathians) finishe in the flesh which they have begone
in the spirit. Galat. 3.3.


I know in deed how hard it is to persuade them which have once tasted off
this sweet inchaunting cup but seeing both the commandment if god / there
own calling and vocacion / and the proffit and commodity off the church
does require yt / It becomes them for the godliness they are off / and for the
life they have spent in the professinge off the Gospel to leave all for CHRIST
and the Gospelles cause / and to follow him wither he calls and leads them:
and as they in a manner first taught and preached unto us the doctrine off the
Gospel / So they would be the first Authors to bring in the Discipline off the
Gospel / and use there estimacion / credit / and authority not to the
overthrowing off the truth off God but to the establishing and preserving off
the same. But yff there be any (for I cannot but hope well off many especially
off those who have seen other reformed churches) but I say if there be any who
either for covetousness / for ambicion / or because they thinck this lordly
state tolerable in Bishops / will by no means be persuaded to rest and
quiet them selves in that mean estate which becommethe the men off God / they
are to be compelled even against there wills and to be forced to return
again to the first and right institution off Bishops.

And surely if we search the fountain and original off these great riches /
we shall find that they neither in the beginning Got this wealth by any right
/ nor yet keep yt to this day: not only because they do no duty off a Bishopp
or Mynister / But also because they wrongfully usurp that / which belongs
unto other. For a great part off there Goods is that which in the beginning
was given for the relief off the poor: which was committed as an alms unto
the Bishopp: which as yt apperethe by the old cannons he should distribute by
his advise / and the consent off the company off the Elders. But after when
they had abolished the power and authority off the Elders / and ruled all
things alone according to there own conscience / They made them selves those
pore men / and took alms to there own use / and so grew rich and welthie /
by the want and necessity off others.

An other part which they have / belongs to the mynisters off other churches
/ which was united to the Bishopprickes by Impropriations: besides proxies and
other tolles and fees which they take off the ministers: Therefore what right
have they to usurp that as there own / which was given in times past for the
maynteyninge off ministers in other churches? Therefore when they have restored
to the pore and to other ministers that which is there own / if yet they have
more then is meet for a Bishop / let them bestow it off other there pore
fellow ministers: who in many other places want necessaries by reason off the
poverty off the churches which they serve: that at the last / being content
which an honest and reasonable living / they may return again to th^r
original and first beginning.

These words off diminishinge the pomp and welthe off Bishops / as it
displeasethe some who thinck that some credit and authority is gotten to the
gospel thereby / So it pleases very well those that think this will be
profitable for them and do allreadie gape for this pray and hope for this grea
inheritance. For they thinking that we seek only that the bishops might be
put down / wait for the like pray by there puttinge down as they had
sometimes at the ouerthowe off ^he abbais. For as for Religion they care nor
what become off it / so they may wax welthie by sacrilege and robbery / And
would not stick if it were possible to crucify Christ again / that they
might cast lottes for his coat and divide his garments among the^ / For
this our age has many such soldiers / many such as Denis the king or
rather the tyranne off Syra cusa was / who think that a golden grown is not
fit for God / neither in summer neither in winter / and yet that it will serve
them well at all times and seasons. But if they marck diligently what I say /
they shall well perceive that I favor not in any respect / there covetousness
and greedy desire. For I speak not here off spoilinge the Bishops / or
robbing the goods off the church and geuinge them away to most unworthy men /
but rather that the need off a great nombre / may be relieved by the
abundance and excess off a few: that hospitalles may be maintained and
provided for: and (which is the chief) that the ministry may be established
and maintained through ought the realm: so that by these words / they have no
occasion to hope or look for any thing / but rather to fear they loose not
that which they have / if at any time they have gotten wrongfully into there
hands the patrimony off the church. For they must either restore it again /
that the church may be provided for off worthy teachers / or else make them
selves guilty off the loss and destruction off so many souls / as by there
means are destitute off a minister / and shall perish in there ignorance. But
seeing this place has been handled now fully enoughe (as I suppose) let us
conclude that which I purposed in the begin^inge: namely that the churches
ought the provide for the ministers / and that in such measure that they be
not hindered from doing there duties either by need and poverty / or by
welthe and abundance.

That they be not despised thorowghe need and necessity / nor wax wanton by
excessive riches.

As for that point by what means this ought especially to be done / we must
understand that (which was commanded in the law / touching the geuinge the
te^thes to the priests and Levites / binds not us precisely to the payinge
of te^thes. For this was a politic law off the Jews which binds us only
generally / that we also provide for them / which labor in the Lords work.
But as we are not necessarylie bound to use that way off provision for them /
So if it be commodious for any country / either because the people are
allreadie accustomed unto it / or for some orher civil and politic respect /
yt may be used so that we remember / that which has been showed before / That
the ministers must honestly and liberally be provided for / with out there
taking off any such pains as may hindre the doing off there dewtie. And
seeing the Lord would not suffer the Levites and Priests to the with drawinge
off them from doing there dewtie / to go about the feeldes and see that every
man pay there tithes / and to see it brought home / how much less ought the
worck off the ministry to be hindered by doing this busynes? But also besides
this discommoditie / It is a base and a vile thing for them to vewe every man's
feelde lest they be deceived / and to know the nombre and increase off every
man's flock or cattle and off other things wheroff by the custom off our
realm the tenthes are paid: especially saying he shall be forced sometimes to
strive with peuishe and covetous men for his right which in such a man /
(especially in such a case) were a shameful and unworthy thing.

Therefore if we thinck good to keep still the tenthes and to pay the
Ministers off them / the magistrate must provide for this by his authority /
that they may be free from all these troubles / that they may wholly bestow
them selves / in readinge / meditating / and expoundinge off the Scriptures /
and at one word in doing off there dewtie. And to see that so doing they may be
honestly and liberally provided for / For thus we read that the godly and
noble king Ezechias did: 2. Chro. 31.4.5.6.7.8
who brought to pass by his authority / first that the Priests were provided
for as yt was commanded in the law / Then also he took such order / That
there tithes growinge to a great quantity and store) should be so laid up and
reserved as might be most commodious for the priests. 2. Chro. 31.9.11.
And how meet were it for Christian princes and for the perpetual praise off
there godliness in the church / to follow the example off Ezechias in this
behalffe: who not only brought to pass by his authority that as I said before
the priests and Levites should be provided for / as it was commanded by the
law / but also had a especial care / that That which was liberally given
might be divided to those / to whom yt apperteined / Therefore he built barnes
and granaries for the better commodity off the priests / and finally
appointed certain men by whose means the Levites who were scattered throwgh out
the kingdom were provided for.

Such Auncetors and so worthy patterns and examples off godliness and all kind
off virtue let Good Princes set before them to follow: and not only not spoil
the Ministry them selves or suffer it to be robbed off others / but liberally
according to the commandment off our Savior Christ / see it maintained and
provided for thorowghe out there kingdom nor suffer that That which was once
given to this end be prodigally spent and wasted in courtly Pomp / excess /
and wantones / nor bestowed upon noble men's servants nor other innumerable
sorts off ungodly and intolerable abuses by sacrilege and the church
robbery / but that yt be faithfully ordered and bestowed upon Religion / the
service off god / and publishinge off the word off god thorowghe out the
kingdom and the maintenance off the sacred ministry. Thus they shall prove
them selves to be such kings and Queens as Esaias prophesied off / who should
norishe / cherishe and defeund the church like foster Fathers and nurces.
Esai. 49.23.


Thus therefore having ended this point off the Living off Bishops or
Mynisters / Let us go forward to the next which is touching there garments and
appparell / which apparel being off ij. sorts: that is to say either
belonging to divine service / or which seruethe in the common and daily use
off life / I find nothing written or commanded in in the gospel off either
off them / but only that which is generally commannded touching modesty /
sobernes and honest conversation with all men / which as yt may be referred to
the diet / and household stuff and to all other parts off there life / So also
to there garments and apparel. But a certain kind / form and fashion off
apparel either in daily use off liffe / or else in divine service is no where
commannded in the Gospel. Neither yet under the law was any thing prescribed
to the Levites and Priests for there daily wearinge / in what apparel or
garments they should daily go.

In deed in the divine service which they did in the tabernacle off the Temple
/ such things are diligently and exactly prescribed and set forth according
to the dispensacion off the old Testament. But in these our times wherein by the
grace off God we have the truth yt selffe and the body in Christ our Savior /
we have no longer need off figures and shadows. These things were but for a
certain time / which so long as God would have kept / he left the form and
fashion off there apparel plainly set forth in his law: Exodus 18.^3.
adioining thereunto the punishment off death if any man should trangresse
the law therein. But this difference off apparel / in divine service does no
more belong unto us / the^ the offering up off sacrifice and the kepinge off
other ceremonies off the law. Neither under the law perteined it to any but
only to such / as ministered in the tabernacle and temple: and not to the rest
off the Levites who were scattered throwgh out Jury / and preached the word off
god in the Sinagoges. How much less ought the Interpreters off the gospel use
those veiles and shadows in these days / wherein as the Apostle says / we
behold which open and uncovered face the glory off god. 2. Cor. 3.10
And if it had been needful to have been used / there is no doubt but that
Christ would have warned his Apostles off yt / especially seeing that these
things were before so at large set out under the law. For it is not to be
thought that Christ was less diligent in shewinge how god would be worshipped
under the Gospel / then Moses in showing the same under the law. Or that
Moses being a servant was more faithful in the administracion off the Lords
house / then Christ the Son and heir in his own fathers house. Therefore to
bind the Mynisters to any certain fashion or form off apparel has no grownde
off any precept off the gospel / or commandment out off the word off god.

They are therefore the inuencions off men: and off what men / but even off
such which have sought to paint and adorn with these colors the shame off
there wherishe idolatry and superstition. For as if they had been ashamed off
the simplicity off the gospel / which they ought rather to have had in
reverence and in honor / They thought good to follow what so ever had any show
or ostentacion in any Religion / and thought it to be used to the setting
forth off the gospel. Thus they take out off the law almost all there
massing apparel by a folishe and ridiculous imitation: that having an alter
and a priest they might not want apparel for the stage. As for the surplice it
is notable which is written off hope Siricius who fetches the cause and
original off yt from Christ: and prouethe that we ought to use a lin^en
garment at divine service be cause Christ was buried in a winding sheet. A
notable reason surely why we should use the surplice in our churches / but
peradventure they are ignorant off there own antiquities / and the surplice is
to be thought rather to have been borrowed by them off certain Egyptian monckes /
who upon the skins which they used to wear for there apparel did wear
lynnen garments: from whence also the name off Surplice seems to come.

Such like reasons are to be found in there wrightinges: but to let pass
these trifles / it is to be lamented that even among us who profess the
Gospel / there were some / that when the whole papacy was to be consecrated /
and this Rome to have been vowed to destruction / according to the vow and
curse off the city off Hiericho / who being deceived with the fair and
glitteringe show off the Babylonishe garments / brought them as Acan did into
the tents off Israel. For why do they command a cope and surplice to be used
in divine service? or a Tippet and a Square Cappe to be worn daily but
because they think it is of some authority with the people / and brings some
estimacion to there office and to there persons / and is thought to be of great
force / to make a man seem to be grave and off authority. For these be the
best reasons which they are wont to bring: whereby they would signify both that
these ij. sorts off apparel are not commanded for Religions sake / and that
the abusing off them heretofore / cannot nor ought not to take away the right
use off them / which belongs to comlynes and order / to which end contrary
to the Apostles mind they wrest that place off S. Paul / That all things are
to be done orderly in the church. 1. Cor. 14.40.
But if they perteine only to a decency and comlynes / what needs any
commandment to be given to a minister to use daily the tippet and the square
cappe / and a Priests gown / and at devine service the cope and the surplice
/ seeing a minister who is set over the government off the church / and by the
Apostles rule ought to be such a one / as not only is able to use him selffe
honestly in every thing / but also such as keeps his family in order / and
ought to be an example off all modesty and honest comlines to his flock: who
suerly if he be meet for such an office and worthy to handle the word off
god / will take heed that he do not dishonest his worthy office / by vile and
dishonest apparel.

But seeing they make no worthy ministers / but readers and service saiers / yt
was needful / they should appoint them what cappe they should wear: and how
the sleeves and collers off there gowns should be made and such like.
Although they atteine not this decency and comlines which they pretend / for
often times there is nothing more filthye and dishonest then this kind off
apparel. And if any can use a comely square cappe he can use also a round
cap which is as comely / and so much more / as it is fitter for his head the^
the square.

Therefore there is no cause to prescribe this apparel to be daily worn for
decency and order. But they say the Ministers must be distinguished from other
men: and that they may be known off there parishiners and church. This is even
as great a reason as the other. For if they did set such a shepherd over the
sheepfolde off god / who were able as well with his voice / as the sheppherd
with his hook and staff / to rule his sheep / who were able also to heal
the sick and diseased / and to bring home again such as wander and straie
out off the way / finally if they set a right sheppherd over the flock /
the sheep would know him by his voice / and would not need to have any mark
by his apparel to know him. Therefore allthoughe this reason might be off some
force for hirelinges / yet it cannot be of any force for meet and worthy
ministers.

And whereas they allege also Order and decencye for there surplice / I would
know why yt should seem more comely and decent for a Minister / that be
should preach or pray in a surpl ce / then in a gown.. In white raiment then
in black apparel? For as for the color / me thinks black to be more comely
for him: and for the fashion me thinks a long garment reaching down to the
foot should be more honest and seemly. Further more do they not see that
Simplicity liked our savior Christ / that the Gospel is in a manner shadowed
and covered by these vayles and figures / that by this means / the way is
made open to bring in many other moo ceremonies for as good respects as these
be? do they not also think that we perceive that nothing else is sought by this
which they call comelines and order but only a conformity with Papists and a
superstitious decency? as also in using the sign off the cross in baptism /
the round cake in the Lords supper / and many other such ceremonies / and
not that seemly order which the Apostle commands? 1. Cor. 14,40.
For if the simplicity and nakedness off the gospel / misliked them / why did
they especially clothe it with popish apparel / seeing we ought to be so much
the further off and to abhor there doings / by how much we are in greater
danger off them / then off other heretics because they live among us? For
which cause also the Lord commanded that greater severity should be used
against them off the land off Canaan / then against Idolaters off other nations
and cuntries.

But they say further / that men should be admonished that they are now used
to an other end / then they were by the Papists / and that the abuse cannot
take away the right use off the^: and although the popish priesthood be a
most grievous leprosy / yet the apparel which they used / if yt be washed
again may be applied again to our use, but I say / that off all the leprous
garments / they have chosen the filthiest and most polluted: and such as
cannot be washed nor made clean again by any art or conning off the fuller.
For seeing it is manifest that Popish Priests received there orders / by the
puttinge on off a surplice and square cappe / and that they used the coope even
to the singinge off mass / who is he that has learned by the law off god to
distinguishe and discern between sore and sore / between holy and unclean /
and vnderstandethe not / and even seethe with his eyes / that the leprosy was
spredde upon these garments / and that they are polluted and unclean / not
only by the contagion off the leprous man / but even by there own disease:
Levi. 13.52.
And therefore by the law not to be washed / but to be burned / nor to be
purged with water but to be consumed with fire. Saying then it is so / and that
this law off prescripte apparel off ministers / has no grownde not only off
no scripture / but also off no sownde Judgment and reason / a merueile it is to
see how earnestly and with great contencion / yt has been defended and
maintained. And it makethe me afraid to remember the bitterness of those days /
the churches bereaved of there ministers / and most faithful Pastors and
Doctors driven from there places / the troble that came in the universities for
this cause / and the most toward youth both for godliness and lerninge driven
out off there colleges / finally the commandementes off god transgressed that
the precepts off men might be established.

But they have made me to long in a matter off small weight / who do so
earnestly urge these trifles / as if they were matter off great weight and
were grounded off the commandment off God: But saying yt appears manifestly
(as I suppose) by that which I have said that yt is far otherwise / Let us
conclud / that noe certain kind / form / or fashion off apparel is to be
prescribed to ministers neither to be daily worn / nor yet in service time:
and that they are only to be admonished that they show them selves sober /
modest / and honest both in there apparel and in all the rest off there life
and conversation: which if some shall neglect to do / and being admonished
by there breethren do not amend yt / let the^ be corrected by the magistrate.
And thus much generally off Bishopps: that is to say off ministers.

Now it follows to declare the diverse sorts and kinds of them: and to show
what every one has proper and peculier to hi^ selffe. There be therefore two
kinds and sorts off Bishopes / the one off Doctors / the other off Pastors.
For these are not to be confounded / as if one and the self same office were
signified by two names / as some have supposed. For saying the Apostle in the
iiij. to the Ephesians does severally rehearse all the ministers off the church
which Christ has given and appointed to the edifyinge theroff / and
distinguishes Apostles from Prophets / and Prophets from Evangelists / I do
not see why we should not think also / that Pastors and Doctors as they are
distinguished and severed by name / to be so also in office and duty which also
appears more manifestly in the xij. to the Romans / where they are
distinguished not only by names / but also by gifts proper to several
offices. Therefore these are diverse and sundry offices / how near so ever they
seem to be together. Romans 12.^.7.


Now to prove that only Doctors and Pastors be Bishopps / and that no man else
(as it has been said here to fore) may or ought to minister the word off god
in the church / needs a longer proof. But seeing it cannot be doubted / that
the Apostle rehearses in the iiij. to the Ephesians all the offices and
functio^s which have any thing to do with the worck off the ministry / and
by which Christ would have his church builded up / and seeing that those offices
off Apostles / Evangelists / and Prophets / are ceased / (as also they were
given only to to serve for a time / and not for the perpetual government off
the church) It is manifest that there remain no other Bishops or ministers
off the word off god but only Pastors and Doctors. But that it may the more
clearly be showed / that those other offices served but for a time let us more
at large consider the nature and condition off every one off them: And first
for the Apostles office / what it was / it apperethe by the word off our Savior
/ whereby he ordeineth them to the Apostleshipp: namely / This / that they
should go preach the Gospel in all the world and baptize those which believe.
Mat. 27.19 Mark. 16.15.
So that an Apostle was not bound to preach the gospel to any one and
certain province / nacio^ / or country / but to the whole world. So lickwise
Christ before his departure commended not to peter and by him to the rest off
the Apostles any certain sheep off some certain grownd or pasture but all his
flock. John 21.15.16.17.
For as our Savior Christ had given the^ merueilous gifts off the Spirit / So
he would have them bear greater offices. He assigned them not a few acres /
to plowe and till / or a little feelde not some small portion off his vyneiard
and inheritance to dress / but even all his feeld / his whole vyneiard and
inheri^aunce. Such off all the disciples off Christ there were only xij. to
whom afterward were added Paul and as some think Barnabas / who as certain
chief capitaines should bring the world under subjection to the kingdom and
Empire off Christ: And as Master builders who should draw out and describe
the pattern and platform off all the churches / and lay the first foundacions
and grounds: Which so great a charge being laid upon them / excellent gifts
were also given them whereby they might be able to bear and uphold so great a
burden. For they were endewed with a merueilous knowledge off heavenly things
/ and diverse straung tongues and languages / as is yt rehearsed off the xij.
Apostles in the Acts / and as Paul testifiethe off him selffe to the
Corinthes. Act. 2.4. 1. Cor. 14.18.


Furthermore there were many other things proper and peculier to this office
as / that they should be witnesses off the Lords resurrection: Act. 1.22.
Galat. 1.1.
that they should be immediately called and appointed by CHRIST: and otherlike /
Which seeing they can be in no man now adays / yt is plain and evident / that
the Apostleshipp is ceased / and that this worthy and excellent office is no
longer remaininge in the church. whereupon the Apostles who did choose Matthias
into Judas place being void / yet when James was slain / they did choose nome
into his Room or the Room often any other off the Apostles / when they died:
Act. 1.
Act. 12.2.
So that yt is plain that this office is abolished.

Which being plain off the Apostles must be likewise understood off the
Evangelists who served and mynistred unto them / and were after a sort there
vicairs and deputies. For as it does appear in the Acts This was the office of
the Evangelists to accompany the Apostles whom they (when they had gathered
any company off a church together and must needs depart) left behind them
being instructed by them in what sort and order to stablishe the church / who
having set the church in order and provided pastors and Elders to govern yt
/ left it and followed the Apostles again / So they as Emperors and Generalles
/ when they had overcome any city / left as it were some chief captains
behind them / until things could be brought to a better stay / and that
ancientes and elders / as certain perpetual garrisons were set over them / for
the Apostles were appointed to co^quere and to overcome: The Evangelists to
establishe and set in order. The elders to maintain and preserve the church
of god. Therefore this office off the Evangelist must needs cease / saying the
Apostleshippe is ceased allreadie.

As for the Prophets office / although it consisted in expoundinge the
scriptures / yet saying it was joined with extraordinary gift off foretellinge
things to come / necessary for the primitive church / but now no more in use
/ yt can not be doubted but that the office is ceased as well as the gift /
whereupon we may conclude / That saying as Saint Paul witnessethe only
Apostles / Evangelists / Prophets / Pastors and Doctors / were given by
Christ to the edifyinge off the church and the work off the ministry / That
the three first ceasinge / there remain only Pastors and Doctors perpetual
and ordinary ministers off the word. Ephesians. 4.1^.12.


In deed sometimes the lord extraordinarily / in a confused state / where is
no place off ordynary calling / stirs up as be did in our time as yt were
certain new Apostles to lighten the world again with the light off the
gospel: And Eusebius makes mention off some / who says he with a heavenly
zeal off followinge the Apostles went preachinge the gospel to the Indians.
Eusebius in the 5. book of his ecclesiastikall historye
But I speak off the Ordinary state off the church / such as ours ought to
be after so many years. Therefore Saint Paul in the xij. to the Romans
speakinge off this state makethe no mention off Apostles / Evangelists / or
Prophets but only off Teachers and exhorters / calling Pastors / Exhorters as
it shall appear hereafter. Neither was i^ needful that they should continewe
any longer in the church: no more then it is needful after the platform be
drawn that the master builder tarry any longer / but that there be carpenters
and workmen to build and raise the worck as he has appointed.

And it seemethe that our Savior Christ in the stablishinge off his kingdom
followed a kind off order not diverse from that which is used by earthly kings
and princes / Who at the day off there coronacion / and for a certain time after
make many officers for diverse and sundry uses / who serve not only for a
solemnity / pomp and show / but also to great use and service for that time
/ but when things are set in order and the kingdom stablished are used no
longer. So Christ our lord and king / when as being ascended into heaven he
was as it were invested into his kingdom / created Apostles and such other
officers / which should set his kingdom in order and appoint and ordeine a
certain ordinary state for the government and administracion off it: which being
so established and set in order / Those offices should cease / and the kingdom
should be governed as they had appointed.

Therefore theris no cause why we should think the love and care off our Savior
toward his church to be diminished for this cause / or that he dealethe not
bountifully and liberally with us: no more then subjects for the like cause /
have occasion to suspect there kings good will and favor to be changed
toward them. For these things are but for a certain time and perteine to
the beginning off the kingdom / which time seemethe necessarily to require
some other kind of order then all the rest that follows. Therefore to
co^tinewe the same similiritude / after he was crowned-kinge / he scattered in
great abounda^ce spiritual gifts off knowledge / prophesyinge / healinge /
and other graces / as gold and silver among his people: All the conduites
ran with sweet and most pleasant wine: All the pipes and cocks ran with
rose water and other sweet and pleasant waters: But allthoughe he gives us
daily all things liberally and plentifully / yet he gives us not daily a
Largess as at the time off his coronacion. Therefore we ought to be content
with that liberality which the lord shewethe unto us / and not to look to
have allwais alike.

The same reason is off the perpetual mynisters off the word: with whom he
would have us to be contented and not to wish for the first / and those which
were extraordinary and appointed to serve but for a time. For as some thing was
given more liberally and extraordinarily to the extraordinary times off the
church / So we are sufficiently provided for / off all things which belong
to the continual and necessary use off the church. Therefore being content
with this mean estate and condition / Let us use that which is given unto us /
and seek not for offices which served but for a time / in the perpetual
government off the church / nor will he extraordinary functions in an ordinary
state. Wherefore / we ought to have Pastors and Doctors appointed in our church
/ and not to retain still the extraordinary office off preachers: which yet I
reprove more sparingly / for the respect I have to many worthy men who have
labored with some fruit after this sort: for I see that some (by the
negligence off those who ought to have provided meet Pastors for the churches)
for the love they had unto the gospel / thought it lawful for them in these
times to take upon them this Apostolical or Evangelical kind off office and
embassage: whereas rather they owght to have urged the full and perfect
reformacion off our church / and to have striuen by the word off god / that
every church might have been provided off a fit Pastor. And that the Lords
heritage might be no more left barren and untilled / left that at the last /
the Lord be angry with us / and take it from us and let out his farm to other
that will dress it better.

But if there be any which please them selves to much in this gadding abroad
thorough out the churches / and will contend they may do so by the example off
the Apostles and Evangelists / let them show us the signs off there
Apostleship as Saint Paul did to the Corinthians: 1. Cor. 9.2.3.
Let them prove that they are indewed with those Apostolical gifts off
knowledge and understanding / tongues / healinges / doing off miracles and
such like. Let them bring forth the commission off this their so large
embassage to all churches: last off all let them prove that they are immediately
called thereunto off god. For not only one Bishopp but all the Bishops in the
world / are not able to ordeine and make and Apostle / saying that (as it
apperethe by the Argument I have alleged) there office is already ceased.
They cannot be Evangelists neither / saying that they were as yt were the
Legates off the Apostles / who in respect off them were as Proconsulles or
Presidentes. For Prophets I think they will not say they be / saying they
cannot tell us off things to come. Besides that we read not that the
Prophets went thus abroad thoroughe out all churches / but it seemethe rather
that they were wont to abide in certain places. Wherefore taking away
extraordinary callinges and vocations out off the ordinary state off the
church / Let us follow that certain rule which the Lord has prescribed. Let
Pastors and Doctors be assigned unto churches who are only the ordinary and
perpetual ministers of the word off god appointed to the edificacion off the
chu^che.

These things thus set down / let us now see what the particular charges and
duties off these two be. And first let us speak off Doctors: whose office is
more simple. Doctors therefore I call Bishops who are occupied in the simple
teachinge and expoundinge off the holy doctrine and true Religion. For it
semethe that this was the office off Doctors symply to teach out of god his
word / what was to be thought off god and off his worshipp and service: what
off Christ / what the law is: what the Gospel: what is the rule off our life:
what the hope and expectation off the life to come: fynallye what to think off
every point off Religion without those vehement speeches whereby the minds off
men are either raised up and comforted / or beaten down and made sadd. For
seeing that Saint Paul does lymite and bound the office off a Doctor by
Doctrine / Romans 12.7.
and attributethe to an other office To exhort / he seemethe to show that a
Doctor is as yt were the schole master and teacher off the principles off
Religion off with office how great and manifold use there is in the church
off god / we shall easily understand if we consider / how many there be
emonges us that be rude and know not the first principles and growndes off
religion. Which being unworthy and unseemly for a Christian church and for
our profession off the gospel / Let Teachers and Doctors be provided (such as
we have but a few right and lawful in these our dais) to teach the churches
and especially the rude and ignorant. For allthoughe we invent a thousand ways
/ we shall never promote the edification off the church / but only by those
means and instruments which the Lord has appointed for his work. For with
these the blessinge of god is joined which is not only wantinge to those who
are made by us how goodly a show so ever they have / but contrariwise they
have Cursinge for Blessinge. Now to return to Doctors again.

In the primitive church / They were set to instruct in the Doctrine off
faith and Religion such as were rude and ignorant: In the 6. book of his
ecclesiastical history.
For so Eusebius tells that when in the church off Alexandria many had fled
away for fear of persecution / so that no man had the charge of Cathechizinge
/ Orige^ being a young man and But xviij. years off age / at the request off
certain worthy men took the charge upon him. Wherewith all though in the
beginning he joined also teachinge off grammar and other arts / yet he
afterward understood / that yt belo^ged not unto his office so to do / and
therefore gave him self wholly to the expoundinge off the scriptures / and
instructinge off such as were ignorant in religion. The whom after one
Hercules succeeded in the same office / whom before he had taken to him to help
him to teach: who afterward was chosen from being Doctor / to be Pastor and
Bishopp off the same church / wheroff it may be gathered that in the primitive
church / this was an ordynarie office: and that before Pastors / and Bishops /
there were other also appointed to be Doctors / whose office did consist in
expounding the scriptures / and cathechizinge off the ignorant.

But as for our Doctorshippe such as it was in time off popery and as
co^tynueth yet still / I know neither from whence it came / nor to what use yt
seruethe. For they expound not the scriptures in any certain church
appointed unto the^ / declaringe the natural and true sense and meaning off
the word off god / they do not teach the youth nor cathechize the ignorant /
but live idly in the vniuertsities. For it is no name off any lawful office or
function in the church no not as yt is used in the universities but only a
name and title off honor / and a commendacion off a man's knowledge in divinity
so that it rather seems to serve to ambicion and vainglory / the^ to any use
and proffit.

They say there was sometimes an image maker named Passo who did so engraue the
image off mercurye in marble-stone that a man could not judge or discern /
whither mercury were within / or without the same. Such Mercuries / and Images
do our universities make us / whose knowledge we cannot tell whither it be
within them or without them / for they prove not them selves to be right
Mercuries by any speech / eloquence / or utterance / I know not what a
shadow and Image off vain contemplacion this is / for true and Christian
Religion bestowethe the gifts that are received of god / to the common use and
proffit off all the body Therefore these Mercuries are to be appointed to
churches and to be set up in high and lightsome places / that their speech
and talk and other properties may prove them to be right Mercuryes in deed.

For suerly it is not tolerable that they should bury the lords treasure in
the earth and hid his light under a Bushel / and as it is said off one
Aspendius a harper / that they should play on there sweet harpes as they
selves may only hear it. Therefore let these goodly lights be put on
ca^dlestickes / that as Christ commands they may shine and give light not
only to them selves / but to all that are in the house. Man. 15. Math. 25.^^.
Let this rich treasure be laid out to the banck / that when the Lord commethe
he may receive his own with advantage: that is to say / let these learned
Doctors be assigned and appointed to churches (...) expound the Scriptures / to
Cathechize the rude and ignorant and by the example off David a better and more
excellent harper / Let them awake in the morning to singe: Psa. 108.2. Esa.
49.27
and awake there harpes together with them / and call both rich and pore and
all degrees and orders to hear them / and sing and play not to them selves
only but to the church / and set out there heavenly songs and dities with
most pleasant tune and melody in the hearing also off many off other. Let this
knowledge be brought to action and to the use our life. Let the Doctor have a
chair set for him. Let him have scholars appointed him whom he many teach
and instruct in the fear of god and know edge off heavenly mysteries: I mean
a chair wherein he may sytte to teach and to cathechize / not wherein taking
his ease he may be idle and fall a sleep

And suerly it is a merueile to see that when they should especially labor /
then they do give tho^ selves most off all unto ease. And that they the^
cherishe and make most of them selves / as yff they were allredy come from the
Seas into the haven / when they should rather leave the haven and take the
Seas. For when they are once made Doctors / either for their understanding and
knowledge / or for their time and continuance / then they obtain I know not
what privileges from taking off pains any more / Prerogatives off honors and
estimacion / privileges off heapinge off benefices together / so that they
seem to be like old soldiers who be exempted from doing any more service /
or to be arrived at this Doctorshipp / as it were at a haven where they should
be at an end off all their labor and travel.

This is therefore to be corrected by us according to the Ordinance off God /
Teachinge and Cathechizinge is to be required off a Doctor. Touching there
examinacio^ / how to try them who are to be chosen to this office I think it
not needful to speak any more / both because I have spoken heroff generally
and at large before / and also for that there is no great fault in the laws
and statutes / but rather in negligence and want off execution off the same
laws and good Statutes. I omit also to speak off thee election and the manner
off chosinge off them. Which being done by an university and by the consent
off so many learned and worthy men I would not disalowe. As for so many foolish
trifles as are used in the creatinge and ordeininge off them / they are
sufficiently confuted already by that which has been spoken by the
ordeininge off Bishops.

And thus much off Doctors. In which place also some are wont to speak off
schools colleges and universities / because they seem to carry a certain
lykenes and similitude off Doctors and Disciples / teachers / and Scholars /
Prophets / and sons off the Prophets. Which sure is a worthy point and very
needful to be handled considering the diverse abuses off schools / colleges
/ and universities: but yet it conteinethe more matter then may be well handled
at this time: For it had need off a several treatise / which I trust / as
already touching schools has been worthily and lernedly handled by master
Askham in his Schole master / So touching the rest / some off that learned
company wheroff there arise daily many noble and most excellent wits will
perform. And surely it were worthy the labor off some notable excellent man /
to teach the use of universities / and to call them back again to the right
end whereunto they were ordained and appointed: which is this / that they
should be means to preserve and make perfect all other noble arts and sciences
and especially divinity which knowledge if it be not diligently kept by the
Doctors in the aulters off the Universities / as in times past the fire that
came down from heaven was by the Levites: Surely it will shortly come to pass
/ as we have already seen yt and that with in these few years / that the
church shall use strange fire / to the doing off all things. Sam^el.
1.19.19.20. King. 2.2.3.5. King. 2.22.^.4.


Such Universities the holy history rehersethe those off Naioth Bethel,
Hiericho, and Jerusalem to have been which (when all men thought surely that
this fire off gods word and knowledge off the scriptures had been clea^e gone
out (as yt came to pass also in these our days) norished certain sparks in
the ashes / off which afterward by good blowing off them / they kindled
Religion again. And such universities should we also have now a days / which
might both kindle Religion being put out / and also inflame and increase yt
being kindled / yff the sons off the Prophets did painfully bestow them
selves in readinge meditatinge and expoundinge off the scriptures as we read
those off Samuells college did. Sam. 1.19.20.
But now in stead off labor / ydlenes is come into the universities: for peace
and honest quietness: contention and discord / the greatest poison to good
studies that can be: for godliness and the fear off the lord / neglect and
almost contempt off all Religion / with dissolute kind off license and
liberty whereby they give them selves to all riot and wantonness.

And suerly yt greeueth me to think how far off they be from the Muses and
lerninge who dwell even in the very houses and palaces off the Muses. And that
these places which are set furthest from any noise off the world that we might
the more freely give our selves to good and honest studies / ringe with cries /
noyses / and alarmes / raised up by troblesome wits / and sound again with
mutual reproaches / hatred / injuries / and reuenges: and that even the very
temples off Religion the aulters off holiness / and the chappelles off godliness
and off the fear off the lord do wax profane unholy and void off all true
Religion. What do we think that those noble worthies which at there great costs
and charges founded colleges to this end that the service off god and holiness
off life might spring from them / and from those fou^taines flow to the rest of
the church / what do we think I say / would they say if they were gathered to
gether and should look down from heaven upon there colleges? dowe not think
they would complain one to an other / that there colleges were become like
unto tents off war wherein nothing were exercised but hate and enmity / and
that eue^ in those places which they had made to be hyues off a heavenly kind
off honey / an innumerable sort off oranes are risen up who not only gather no
honey themselves / but so mislike also off the labor and diligence off other
that take great pains to gather / that they never cease to vex and molest
them until they have driven them out off there h^^s from among them.

What if I should raise out off there grave / some / either off the holy
Bishops founders off the university off Oxeford / or off the famous kings
founders off the university off Cambridge / what if that noble kink Henry the
eight the last off that worthy company (as Hercules was the last of the
worthies) because he is last to deal with the universities in behalffe off the
rest / what I say could they annswer him if he should complain / that That
which was most liberally and bountifully given for the maintenannce off good
lerning is abused to riott and idleness? That the hiues for Bees / are become
den^s for droanes? that They are no more / colleges off students / but
monasteries and cloisters off idle and snoring monckes? That not only barren /
and unfruitful trees / but alalso off hurtful and most noysom shadow to
those young and fruitful plants / that grow up under them / are in those
places / which they meant should have been Orchiardes off most precious fruit
/ and off the most noble and rare plants that might be.

The universities ought to be the seed and the frye off the holy ministry
thorowghe out the realm: but now there is scarce one sent out in to the
church in many years that is fit for such an office. It ought in deed to
be like the Aple treoff Persia wheroff Theophrastus makes mention: which does
budde / blossom and bear fruit at all times off the year: and brings forth
some fruit which is already ripe and some other buddinge / and new geowing
out. So the universities should have some allwais fit / and as it were ripe
already to take the ministry / and some other ripening and budding out: but
now neither ripe fruit fallethe from the tree / neither is the blossom such as
declares any plenty or store to come hereafter: if further he should complain
that it is a heavy sight for them to see the universities thoroughe contention
(and that many times for small occasion) so inflamed and set on fire. And that
as they are grieved / who do behold there feeldes and possessions wasted and
burnt / So they with no less sorrow behold / good / learned and worthy men
expulsed out off there universities / godly / and learned young men driven from
there places / the schools deprived off most famous professors and Teachers /
Colleges bereaved of youth of merueilous hope and towardnes / off singular
virtue and learning / and the church deceived off that which she looked for at
there hands.

Therefore if they loved god there chief founder and Author off all that had
been bestowed upon them / or feared that he would be a punisher and revenger
if they continewe to abuse the same / if they bare any respect and reverence
to them there Patrones and founders and would be ruled by them / they should
leave there striuinge and runninge one against and other with mutual wrongs
and injuries / they should banishe out ydlenes and expulsing the droanes out
off there hiues fall to labor and take pains again: they should apply the
study off the liberal arts and off the tongues / they should meditate upon
the Scriptures and exercise them selves therein as the Prophets and the sons
off the Prophets: They should think with them selves / and remember that the
church hangs upon there breasts / desyring to suck that sweet milk off
heavenly doctrine (and as Peter calls it the sincere milk off the word: 1.
Pet. 2.2.
that they should make ready every year a great no^bre off fit interpreters and
Teachers off Religion for the use of the church: that they would be the
Authors and seekers of a more full and perfect reformacion: and when they had
obtained it constantly to keep / and preserve the same. These things would be
acceptable to god there Arch founder and to them there founders / and be most
seemly and becomminge the name off an university.

If I say we hard him speak these and such like things unto us would we
not be a shamed to be so sharply reproved? Yet allthoughe we hear not either
king Henry the eight / or any other off those worthies speak thus unto us /
yet notwithstanding we ought not to be less moved with the thing yt selffe /
seeing these things may trewly be objected unto us and cast in our teethe.
Which neuertherles I speak not off all such as be in the universities / for I
know there be many such as we would wyshe that all should be: and undoubtedly
there would be many more / if Samuelles Eliahs and Elishas were set over the
sons off the Prophets / who (as they were wont to do) might live together
with the Scholars / be present at there exercises / help an further there
endeavors / and by there example frame them and stir them up to all godliness /
knowledge / zeal / and finally to every thing that is praise worthy. ^. Sam.
19.^0.
2. King. 6.3.
^. King. 6.1
If our universities had many such Samuells, Eliahs, Doctors and Pastors would
be prepared for the churches which are abroad / the number off students (as yt
did under) Elizeus would increase and multiply: and most pleasant streams as
out of Eden, the garden off the Lord / would flow from them and water all the
Land.

But seeing that is far otherwise / being content with this moderate reproufe
/ and light showing off the disease only / for help and remedy / first most
humbly I be seeche the Lord god the chief chauncellor off our universities /
and then also the Magistrates that by his apointeme^t and in his name are set
to govern us / that they would earnestly and carefully think off reforminge
the universities / and restoring them to there right use again / that they may
serve to the preseruinge / polishing and perfiting off all other the liberal
sciences / and especially off the study off divinity and maintenance off the
sacred mynistery. And let it be sufficient to have spoken thus much off
Doctors and therwithall of schools / Colleges and universities.

Now let us speak off Pastors: whose office and function allthoughe it be
near of kindred unto the doctors function / yet it conteinethe in it besides /
certain other things neither off less weight nor less necessary then these
be. A Pastor therefore I call a Bishopp / who appliethe the Scriptures to the
diverse occasions and necessities off the church: and ministrethe the
Sacraments to those which do believe. For Pastors touching the office they
bare in the churches / succeed the Apopostles: and after a sort also the
priests off the law: whereas Doctors do rather resemble and are more like unto
the Prophets and the Levites. Therefore Pastors administre not only the word /
but also the Sacraments. And seal up our salvation with the Lords signet /
which they preach by word. For this is the nature off the Sacraments / to
seal up as it were the promises / that when we have them under seal / we
might keep them more safely and possess them more securely. Wherefore the
Pastor to whom the promises are committed to be declared and uttered / and as
yt were the writings and inde^tures off our salvation to be made / has also
authority to set the seal thereunto. For so the Lord commanded his Apostles
that they should preach the Gospel / and baptize those which should believe.
Wherefore the administracion off the Sacraments perteinethe to the office off a
Pastor and that in such sort to a Pastor / that no man else may take yt upon
him / and arrogate that to him selffe which the Lord has committed to an other
to do.

But besides the administracion off the Sacraments this is also proper and
peculier to the Pastors / even in the ministry off the word to apply the
Scriptures to the diverse occasions and necessities off the churches: And as
time and occasion seruethe / to correct / reprove / and reprehend / to raise up
those that be cast down / to break the stubburne / to use exhortacions / and
dehortacions / to cmofort the godly with the hope off the promises / to
terrify the wiked with the thunder off the judgment off god / whereat they
may be cast down and as yff they had been stricken with a thunder bolt from
heaven and consumed / yff they repent not / to lift up some as yt were to
heaven / and to cast down other to the bottom off hell. Romans 12.7.
All which Saint Paul does signify to the Roman figuratiuelie by nanynge
one kind theroff (that is to say off Exhortation) for all the rest. In his
Epistle to Timothy he settethe out every thing more at large: ^. Timoth. 4.3.
commandinge Timothy to preach the word / to correct / to reprove / to exhort.

Seeing therefore the Pastors office is so wayghty and so diverse: I will not
show that they which be unable to teach are not to be admitted unto it / for
that I have handled this before / but how weak there defense herein is which
they are wont to bring: that is to say / That the want off these unable
ministers / is supplied by the diligence off others / whereas they read and
rehearse out off the book unto the people / homelies / touching all the
necessary points off Religion. I dispute not here against homelies / nor
mind to show what injury is done unto god his word when the wrightinges off
men are redd and rehearsed in the church: or how dangerous a thing it is for
geuinge occasion off bringing in to the church / the writings and sermons
also off other godly men / the stories off martyrs / and at the last also the
Popish Legend / For that it belongs to an other place to speak off these
things: this one thing I will show / that the reading off Homelies is no
sufficient excuse for an unable and unlearned Pastor / seeing that it belongethe
to the dewtie off a Pastor / to apply the doctrine off the Scriptures to the
diverse times / necessities and occasion off the church.

For seeing that the Homelies be domme / and speak only that which has been
endited a long time a fore / how can they either know or understand / or cure
and remedy the diseases off the church. Therefore let us not think that the
Ordeininge of^ unable Pastors can be excused by this pretense. nor that
Homelies (as it is said off a sword in old time as Delphos which did serve
for all uses) can serve for all occasions which do arise in the church.

Here the Pastor had need off great and profounde knowledge to know the
change off times / the diversity off things / the variety off persons / and
to deal thus or otherwise / according to that variety and difference. For a
Shephard has not only one way both to heal the sike / and cure the broken
and bruised: And the physician cures some men by diet and medicine / some by
cutting and surgerie / so likewise this only way off readinge off Homelies can
in no wise be sufficient to cure and to remedy all the sundry necessities off
the church / To be co^ninge in the profession off this kind off physic / a
man had need be perfect in his simples / he had need to know many kinds off
herbs / flowers / rotes / an infynite sort off other things: finally he must
needs thouroughly know all Eden and the whole garden off God / that he may
know what herbs are fit to raise up those who are cast down / and as it were
to comfort and restore again such as be in a consumpcion / which also are
meet to purge and cleanse those that are full and stuffed / finally what so
ever is proper for the curinge off every disease / and in what sort and after
what manner / and at what time yt is to be ministered and applied.

Which most worthy and necessary office for the salvation off mankind and
chiefest off all which be under the Son Good Lord how infinite ways is it
profaned? So that now a days to make a Pastor is nothing else but to make a
service saier / or reader off prayers out off his book. And this not only
emonges the people but even in the midst off the universities / in the
schools and Colleges them selves (from whence as from certain sacred and pure
fountains reformation ought to flow) from thence I say even from thence
shameful examples off this great disorder and prophanacion do spring and come
furthe into all the realm. if we seek thoroughe both the universities what
schole is there / what College / society and fellowshipp off learned men that
has a right and a lawful Pastor among them? But either one or more
chaplains and conductes as they call them are hired to read the service at
the hours appointed / or else the fellows off Colleges them selves do read
yt being bound by oath to enter into the ministry at a certain time appointed /
after they become Fellows. Whereupon it comes to pass that a man may find
sometimes / ten or a dossen off these Pastors in a little College / But one
such Pastor as the word off God does set out is hardly or not at all to be
found among them.

Further also this fault is made in the apointinge off pastors. That under
pretense off making a more full and perfect trial off such as are to be
appointed / they ordeine not any man wholly / and at once to the office off a
pastor / but I know not by what degrees they lead him up to this pulpit. They
must first be Deacons as they call yt for a year / that is to say they must
receyve authority to say prayers and read the Scriptures / But in no case to
admynister the Sacraments or to expound / without further lycense: Then at the
last he is fully admitted to he office off a Pastor. Which as I perceive well
enoughe to have been translated from the manner off Popish ordres / So know I
not what ground off Scripture yt has or can have / But rather co^trarywise /
yt semethe to be clean against the express appointement off the Scriptures
which make no more degrees to come to the office / But the godliness and
integrity off his former life in what sort so ever he has occupied him
selffe unto that time / and the knowledge off the holy scriptures: So that it
is needles for a man to come thoroughe all the offices off the church before
he can ever atteine to this.

Wherein also there was to to curious a diligence in Siluester Bishopp off Rome
and others / who appointed that before a man was ordained a Pastor / he should
first come up unto yt as yt were by certain stairs / steps / and degres
thoroughe out all those offices off the church which they had invented.
Counsel off Rome the second. and the 1^. canon.
And first he must be Accolythus twenty year. Deacon xxvj. and so forth. That
at the last after fyfty or three score years trial thus had / he should be
admitted to the full priesthood.

Leaving therefore these vain inventions off the brain off man / Let us keep
that certain order which is taught us by the Apostles: which is That after
dew examination had of his life and doctrine / he be admitted to this
ministry and office off a Bishopp / Lest by this drawing a sonder and
quarteringe off the right office off a Pastor we be justly thought to have
brought into the church off god with out his word / off our own authority so
many new offices and functions / as into how many parts and members this one
office is divided.

Touching those things which besides this are faulty in the Election and
Ordinacion off Pastors / they have been spoken off in other places before /
neither is it needful to repeat the same again: Therefore to conclude all this
treatise off Bishops / taking away extraordinary functions and offices and
abolishing the pomp and tyranny off the Lord Bishops / Let us esteem the
office off a Bishopp and minister as yt is declared unto us in the word off
god: Let us remember that this is a service and Ministry not off the affairs
off this life / But off the holy word off god: Let this most neceessary office
among all other offices that be in the earth both for the service and
Religion off God and for the salvation off man be ordained and established
thorowgh out this Realm: Let an Assay be made / that they which being unmeet
for the office / being put out / godly / learned / and worthy men be chosen
thereunto: who discharging there offices faithfully / may be sufficiently
provided for / concerning the necessaries off this life / as the Lord has
commanded: Let us fetch the manner and fashion off our examininge / choosinge
/ and ordeininge out off the Scriptures: Let Doctors be appointed to teach /
and Cathechize the rude and ignorant: Let Pastors be ordained to Mynister the
Sacraments and to apply the general Docrine to the particular uses and
occasions off the church: That faults being amended and reformed according
to to the right line off the word off God / a just and lawful ministry such
as the Lord has appointed may be established among us: That Christ powringe
his blessing upon his own Ordenance and apointment (as the Apostle notes these
to be the ends off the ministry) the work off the ministry may be done / The
body off Christ which is the church may be edified and builded up / and the
Saints may be fitly / orderly / and proportionally joined and knit together
one with an other. Ephesians. 4.21.


Thus now having finished one part off ecclesiastical functio^s and charges /
namely that which consists in the duty off a Bishop and the Ministry off
the word / Let us come to that which remains and concerns deacons: But to
the end we may herei^ also orderly proceed / first / I say that Saint Paul
in his first epistle to Timothy and third chap. and in the other places before
alleged off me to the same end calls all those Deacons / which do exercise
any office or or charge in the church / not belonging to the Ministry off the
word. For there be also other offices besides the ministry off the word /
needful for the preseruacion off the church. Which what they be we shall see
hereafter.

But if they were not necessary for the preservation off the whole body /
Surely Jesus Christ the most wise ruler and gouerner off his church would
never have appointed them: yff then this other order off Deacons be so
necessary / why do we want it wholly in our church: deforminge the body no
less / yea a great deal more by so notable want off those parts that are
necessary / then by the superfluity off those which are not off the body as
has been already before showed. For let them not here speak off there
Chauncelors / whom I have already proved to have no lawful place in the
church: nor off the church wardens / off whom I shall speak more hereafter.
For I say we want and require Ecclesiastical Deacons / who according to the
ordinance off god are lawfully chosen / created and ordemed to there offices:
not civil and politic men who by the authority off the Magistrate deal in
some such matter / but what these be we shall see hereafter more at large.

Here I cannot sufficiently wonder at the boldness off the brain off man who
thus alters and peruerteth wholly / the lords government in his own house:
appointinge some besides those which are appointed by him / to the rulinge off
his house: and putting out those (as if the church off god had no need off
there labor) who^ the Lord him selffe had appointed / finally licensing them
selves in the lords matters to set down and take away / to add and diminishe
what they list / and to rule and dispose all thing according to there own will
and fantasy: The^ the which seeing there ca^ be nothing more against the honor
off our Savior / let us at the last learn to be modest and to be ruled by his
word: let us suffer him to rule his own house by his own authority and
restore again to the church those offices and functions / which he has
thought meet and profitable for it.

But that these things may be the better understood / and that we proceed the
more orderly forewarde. As I showed in the former part / first what was
ordained off God / whereby it was easy to understand what was superfluous or to
much / So I must likewise do in this part / that yt may be the better
understood / what we want / and what is to to be supplied in this behalffe.

There be therefore ij. sorts off Deacons as they are divided by Saint Paul
in the xij. to the Romans: Romans 21 8.
The one sort are called distributers (who also in the sixte off the Acts are
properly called Deacons) The other over seers / who also in other places are
called Elders and Governors off the church. Those therefore who are properly
called Deacons / are officers off the church / set over the bestowing and
distributing off the church goods and treasury.

How great cause there was off institutinge this office in the church / it
appereath in the sixth off the Acts / where the the Apostles who in the
beginning administered the treasury off the church / when they perceived that
they were not able to serve both / that is to say the preachinge off the word
and the caringe for the pore / gave over this office to be Treasurers any more
/ and propounded yt to the church / that there might be a several office
appointed for this charge / that might take upon them the prouidinge for the
poor: To whom should be given / what so ever was bestowed for the relief off
the needy that they might after dispose yt according as every one had need.
That the poor might not be despised in the church off God whom he declares to
be so dear unto him / and that all complaints being taken away / every thing
might be orderly and honestly governed in the house off God. Therefore the
Treasury off the church whither yt be in daily offringes / or in rentes and
reuenuews appointed to that end is to be committed unto the Deacons. The
hospitalles and houses which are appointed for the relief off strangers and
off the poor are to be ruled by them: finally / what other such like thing
there is / belongs to the office off Deacons.

In old time in deed in the prymitiue church / this Treasure was committed
to the Bishops / because all men trustinge to there conscience / whom they
thought to have a special care off yt / hoped that all things would be more
faithfully ordered for the benefit off the church and maintenance off the
poor: But they whereas they ought rather to have followed the example off the
Apostes / and to have requested that they might give them selves to preaching
and prayer / and that they would choose some other to take that charge upon
them / did not only suffer them selves to be entreated to take yt / But also
did vnfaithfullie behave them selves in disposing the poor men's box / that at
the last they ceased to be Almners any more or distributers unto others / and
as yff they had been the poor men gave all unto them selves: concerning which
matter the Deacons (if we had any) ought to deal with the Bishops in the
behalffe off the poor / (whose charge is committed unto them by the church)
and enter an action against them for recovering this money again: to require
again there silver vessels and the golden plate wherewith they have so
gorgeously garnished and adorned there cuphordes and plead against them / that
all that / belongs to the poor: by whose poverty / they have waxen rich:
by whose want and need they are become full and welthy.

Therefore saying the office off a Deacon is so necessary / yt may seem a
merueile / how the church could suffer that the poor and the strangers / who
for Christ's cause ought to be most dear unto us / should want there Gardyanes
and Tutors. We have brought in other Collectors / gatherers and church warde^s
into there room / But yt were better that we had none such at all / then that
by them so necessary an office should be abolished: For saying the charge
requirethe / both a singular wisdom / simplicity and integrity / why should
there not be choice made as in the other offices off the church / trial had
that the wisest may be chosen by the church and as the Apostle Saint Peter
speakethe / such / as be full off the holy ghost and off wisdom. Why are not
hands laid upon them / that they may know that they deal in the Lords
business? Why are they not praid for / that they may have grace to discharge
there duty? Finally why had they rather that they should be cyuill then
Ecclesiastical Officers? this therefore is the charge and office off Deacons:
In whose Election and ordynacion / seeing there is nothing else partyculerly to
be considered besides that which has been Generally spoken off all heretofore
/ Let us come to the Elders which are the second kind and sort off Deacons.

Elders therefore are Deacons / who are appointed to take heed off the offenses
that arise in the church: Therefore in well reformed churches / every one off
them have there ward / and as yt were there watch to look unto off that
portion off the church in which they may most fytlye serve / Wherein if any
thing be done otherwise then ought to be that shall deserve just reproufe /
yff yt be privately committed / He Goes unto the party and admonishes him
privately for his fault according to the word off God / exhortinge him that he
do so no more: but if openly / he certifiethe the counsel or consistory off
the church: lest the fault off one man be spread to the destruction off all
the rest.

For although after a sort / yt is all men's duty to bring him into his way /
which goes astray / yet better and more diligent heed is taken that offenses
arise not in the church / when every part off the church should have there
watchmen assigned to them / to whose office especially it should belong to
mark / ouersee and observe all men's manners. Whereas otherwise there are many
faults which may easily escape those who have not a careful eye ouerthem.
For which cause Saint Paul to the Thessalonians attributes admonitions and
reprehensions / specially unto the Elders / which notwithstanding afterward
in an other sort he declares to belong unto all the faithful. ^. The. 5.12


1. Thessa. 5 12.14.
Therefore those Elders be such as those officers off the Athenienses were / who
had charge to see the laws kept / or as the Censors off Rome / who exacted and
examined every citezens life according to the laws. So they mark and observe
every man's manners / and they them selves do admonish men off the lighter
faults / and bring the greater to the Consistory. Finally they take heed by
all means / lest God be offended with the church by reason off some man's
fault / and see that things be done honestly godly and comely in the church
off God.

Therefore yff there come into there ward any strangers / from other places to
inhabit whose Religion is not yet known / They certify the Ministers that
they may have means to talk with the^ before they come to the Lords supper.
So likewise if there be any children to be baptized / they admonish the
minister of it / and finally off all such things which do belong to the
good and semely government off the church / that the minister should understand
theroff.

Further more also in the administration off the Lords supper for the better
commodity off the church / they help the pastor and take heed that none
come unto the lords supper whose Religion and honesty is not known / and
with whom the ministers have not dealt withal before: and other such like
things which allthough they be not all expressly mentioned in the Scriptures yet
seeing it belongethe not only unto Order and to comelines / But also to the
profit and commodity off the church / that some should be set over these
matters / such as emonges the Jews were those who were called Cheeff off the
Synagoge / and seeing the Scripture mencionethe no other Elders to whom the
charge off these things should apperteine / I think it plain enoughe that
these things by the word off god / ought to be referred to the office off
Elders.

And as for that part off there office / off taking heed to offenses / who can
doubt that / That charge properly apperteineth unto the Elders? seeing that they
are said also in the Scriptures to rule / to ouersee and to govern? Act.
20.28 1 Thessalonians. 5.12. Heb. 13.17. 1. P^^. 5^ (...) 5 17.
For this oversight can have but two parts only / wheroff the first
perteinethe to Doctrine and Religion / the other to life and ma^ners. Seeing
then that two kinds off Elders are expressly named by Saint Paul / where off
the first sort are occupied in preachinge and Doctrine / Iris necessary that
the other should have charge off manners and conversation / which part only
remains.

And hitherto the example off the primitive church does lead us / which for
as much as they were next to the Apostles time / might best understand to what
use Elders had been appointed in the church by them. But how the primitive
church took those degrees off the Apostles / both Ecclesiastical histories
do witness / and reformed churches which in our time have reformed them selves
according to there example / do sufficiently declare.

Therefore seeing the office off Elders was appointed in the church / off our
Savior Christ by his Apostles / and seeing it is so proffitable and necessary
for the same / have we not just cause now to complain / that our church
wants so worthy an office? do not the slanders off our adversaries who are
ready to take all occasions to speak evil off the Gospel require such
watchemen to watch and see that offenses rise not in the church? does not the
shameful wickedness off men require such Censors? And can this noble law off
doing all things orderly and comely in the church off God want those any
longer who should have a care to see it kept? That all things come not to
confusion and be turned vpside down?

Therefore let Elders be restored to our church again which are both necessary
helps for the safetye and preservation off yt and worthy ornaments for the
estimation off the same. Let us obey the Lords Commandment touching the
ordeyninge off Elders / yff either the safety or estymacion off the church be
dear unto us / or yff we have any care off doing our duty unto god.

As for election and Ordynacion off them / seeing yt may be taken out off those
General rules which I have given before / and does not require any thing to
be specially spoken in this behalffe / Let us conclude this matter / and
together with all / even the whole treaty which has been handled concerning
the simple charges and offices off the church / beseech ing God our most
merciful father / that yt may please him to have mercy off our church and
that as he has raised yt in a manner from the dead and out of the grave
again So he would also vouchsafe / to adorn and beautyfy yt being raised up:
That yt may please him to take away the deformyties off yt / cutting off that
which is superfluous / and supplyinge that which wantethe / To increase her
beau^y and ornaments and to Poolishe and perfect her with his most fresh and
lively colors: To restore true Discypline again / To abolishe the Canon law
/ that only they which are called may bare office in the church / That
Ambition may be repulsed and put back / That the the laws off lawful Election
and ordynation may be kept: Finally that a lawful Mynistery may be established
thoroughout the Realm which may continewe for ever: That Deacons may be made
for the poor / and Elders to admonish such as go astray / And last off all
that as he has most mercifully already begonn in our church all things /
which he has most wisely appointed to the glorifyinge off his name and
preseruinge off his church / So yt may please him of like grace and favor to
perfect and finishe his worck emonges us. And thus much off those offices and
charges off the church which we call simple.

It follows now to speak off the Consystory or Council off the church.
Whereoff allthoughe there be no new or special Eelection and ordynacion /
because yt consists off such as are allredy called to the former offices /
yet I thought Good even for this cause to distinguishe them from the former /
for that here no one man has any office or authothoritye to do any thing as in
the former: But there is one office off all / which they all do execute in
common together: For the Consistory or Council off the church is the company
and Assemblye off the Elders off the church / who by common Counsel and
authority do rule and govern the same.

Under the name off Elders / I do mean only Pastors / Doctors and those who
are by proper named called Elders. For I see not what ground yt has that some
would also have Deacons to be off this company. 1. Timot. 4.24.
For seeing that Saint Paul / calls this assembly the company off Elders /
It follows that they must be Elders who be off this assembly. But the name
off Elders is no where in the Scriptures that I can remember attributed unto
Deacons / But only unto Pastors / Doctors / and such as are properly so
called. To prove that Pastors and Doctors be Elders I need not cite many
places (which are infinite) where they are so named. As for them who are
specially called by this name / That one place in the xij. off the Romans may
sufficiently prove. Where the Apostle distinguishinge the office off a Deacon
into two parts gives to those only / the name off Elders and gouerners: Romans
12.8.
calling the other / by an other name.

This Consistory therefore consists of these three ordres / Pastors / Doctors
and Elders: which is called by S. Paul the Assembly off Elders: as also by the
same Apostle they are all called by the name off Elders in an other place. 1.
Timo. 4.14. 1. Timoth. 5 17.
In the xviij. off Matthew our Savior calls them by the name of the church:
because they rule and govern church matters under the name and authority off
the churchr. So likewise the name off all the assembly / by Moses is given to
the Elders off the Jews: that is to say unto certain chosen and picked out men
who were assigned by all the congregation to the government off the affairs.

Thus plainly it is taken in the viij. of nombres where the Lord appoints that
the Congregation shall lay hands upon the Levites: But I think no man will
say that this is to be understood off all the congregation / that so many
thousands should lay there hands upon them / as are rehearsed to have been
then in the host off Israel / but the Elders and princes only / as Aben Ezra
does rightly interpret yt. Which is to be noted the rather / because some will
have the words off our Savior to be expounded off all the church: Levi. 25.
where as according to the manner off speakinge which the Hebries use / the
Consistory or counsel off the church / is called the church: where also it is
to be observed / that together with the name / the thing it self is translated
from the Jews unto us: That look what a Counsel the Jews used for the
government off the church / we ought to understand by this name that such a
one is appointed by our Savior / to be in our church. Therefore in the same
place he attributes to this Counsel the chief government off all church
matters: that all such things as cannot otherwise be agreed and ended / be at
the last brought unto them / and ended by there au^horitie and judgment.

And if there should be any off so desperate boldness / that should despise the
authority off this Assembly off Elders / Our Savior Christ pronounces him to
he as an ethnik or a publycan / assuringe such a one / that his stubburnnes
and rebellion shall not escape unpunished. Wherefore he grants unto them
chief authority according to his word to forgive or retain sins: which
the Doctors off the church are wont to call the keys off heaven / because that
heaven is in a manner set open for them to enter into / whom they have thus
according to god his word forgyuen there sins / as contrariwise it is shut
/ and barred against them / whose sins they do retain.

And seeing that God has given to our Savior Christ all power in heaven and in
earth / and that the keye off the house off David which is the church off god
is given to him / and laid upon his shoulders / so that no man may shut if
he does open / neither open if he do shut / yt is not to be doubted / but
that heaven is open and shut also / when they do open and shutt who have
received his authority and unto whom he has committed this keye.

Therefore as Lacedemon had an assembly off Elders / Athenes a high court
named Areopagus / Rome a Senate / and finally / every kingdom and common
welthe a Counsel whose authority is chief and sovereign in all affairs /
and by whom the rest off the society are governed / So likewise the church
has an Assembly off Elders / by whose authority / ecclesiastical and church
matters are governed and administered. But these things are to be declared more
at large: and all this power and authority more especially and particulerly to
be showed / that we may know how far it extends it selffe / and off how
great force and weight it is to the lawful government off the church.

Therefore the whole authority of the co^sistory consists in ij. parts. off
which the first concernethe the officers off the church / that is to say /
touching both the choosinge and deposinge off the^: whereof I shall not need
to speak in this place / seig I have sufficiently spoken before off Elections:
whereby also may be easelye understood / that which apperteynethe to the other
point off depositions.

Romans 16.^^
The second part off this authority consists almost wholly in taking heed
to offenses and correcting and remouinge them out off the church. Which
offenses / Saint Paul seems in the xvj. off the Romans / to divide into two
sorts: into sects / and Offenses: wheroff the first seems to apperteine unto
Doctrine / and the other unto manners All which authority off Correctinge is
spiritual / as proceeding not from the Magistrates but from the Elders off the
church. For as this counsel is Ecclesiastical / and the court a spiritual
court (as we use to call yt (as also it is manifestly distinguished by S. Paul
/ from the cyuill courts and places which the Apostle calls courts for
things belonging to this life) So also the punyshement is special and such
as belongs to the soul and Conscience / and concerns not this life nor
those things with which the civil magistrate is wont to deal. ^. Corr. 6.^


So that they are the more to blame / who for this cause reject and refuse all
Ecclesasticall kind off punishment / as injurious to the magistrate / seeing
it handles nothing that the magistrate can in such sort deal with all / but
is lymited and bounded with reprehensions taken out off the word off god by
taking away the use and communication off Sacraments and public prayers
from them and such like things as do apperteine to the soul and conscience.

But most off all they are to be blamed who do falsely charge this lawful
discipline as I showed (whith offendinge against Princes and magistrates:
whereas yt neither punysheth any thing which belongs to the courts off civil
officers / nor yet punysheth with cyuill punisheme^t / as off goods or off
body / any fault which it corrects: but only in such sort as has been
declared whereas they who do object this / may be charged with both faults.
For this discipline off theyrs both deals in cyuill causes / and by right
apperteyninge to the courts off the Magystrates / and often times those whom
they have authority to correct / they punyshe by the purse or emprisonment.
But to pass these lightly over for have (which notwithstanding are most weighty
accusations / and worthy for the haynousnes off them to be de^ie with in the
kings benche / as offending so highly against the state and authority off the
prince and Magistrate) Let us come to the diverse kinds of Censures and
reprehensions which are used in this lawful discipline.

Now this correction is off two sorts: and is done either by Speech or words
only / as when a man is rubuked for some fault which he has committed and is
warned to take heed that he offend not so again / or else when besides the
chastisement off words / there is some spiritual punishment and correction
adjoined thereunto) Example we have off the first sort in the fourth off the
Acts / where Theapostells Peter and John being brought to the Assembly off the
Elders / they were asked by what authority they taught the people / and
preached the resurrection from the dead in the name of Jesus: for which after
that they had been rebuked and threatened / they were forbidden to preach or
speak any more to any man in the name off Christ / and so let go.

In deed they did wickedly to rebuke them for the preachinge the of gospel /
the best thing that ca^ be and most necessary for the salvation off man: but
yet by this there doing we may perceive what was the form off government off
the church emonges the Jews / which our Savior Christ has translated to his
church: For this is it that our Savior Christ meanethe in the xviij. off
Matthew / and xvij. verse / when he commands the stubborn that will not be
obedient to the admonytion off two or three / to be brought to the church /
that he may be admonished and corrected by the church. Where unto also
belongs that / where S. Paul admonishes Tymothy off reprouinge the Elders
openly: that is to say / such / as had been lawfully convicted. 1. Timoth.
5.20.


And for those admonitions and corrections which have some punishment joined
with them / for the diversity both of faults and punishementes they are
divided into two sorts: And resemble in a manner those two punishementes off
the Romans / whereby the state / condition / and privilege off such as did
offend was diminished: wheroff the first is called by Ecclesiastical writers
Suspension / the second Excommunication.

Now suspension is a charge given by the assembly of the Elders to absteyne a
certain time from the communication off the supper off Lord. Hereoff there is
some example and shadow in the law / which forbids such as be unclean to
be partakers off ho^y things / and suffered not indifferently any to enter
into the Temple / and to be partakers off the Sacraments and sacrifices which
were offered. ^ Chro. 23.^^.
Therefore there were appointed keepers off the gates off the temple by Iehoyada
the priest to keep every filthy and unclean person from entringe into the
temple. Exodus ^^.48.
So also in the xij. off Exodus It is forbidden that any man being
vncircuncised should be admitted to the cmomunicatinge off the Passover: or that
any stranger who by receiuinge circuncision / professed not the like Religion
with them should be admitted.

In the ix. off Nombres there is a notable example concerning this matter / off
certain who being driven from communicatinge the Passover because they had
polluted them selves by touching a dead body / went to Moses and Aaron / that
is to say syttinge in the Counsel house (as it is well noted by an Hebrew
Interpretor) and desired that there uncleanness might be forgeuen them / that they
might eat the passover with the rest off Israel / alledginge that saying off
necessity some must daily die in so great a multitude / yt seemed not that /
that uncleanness wherewith they were polluted by doing there necessary dewry to
there friends and neigbours (in burying off them) should be so great / that they
therefore should be forbidden to eat off the Passover with the rest off the
church. But Moses askinge counsel off god what was to be done in this case /
Answer was made that they should not eat the passover with the rest off there
brethren / and a law made for ever after / touching that matter. That those
kind off unclean persons should not eat the passover with the rest of
Israel in the first monethe / but should tarry to eat yt in the second month.

Out off which places we have many things to gather which belong to the
discipline off the church. And first off that which is in the xij. off Exodus.
That no uncircumcised person should be admitted to eat the passover / no
allthoughe they were Jews / and by nature borne heirs off the covenant and
off the promises / but that open profession off true Religion was necessarily
required as well off Jew as off stranger before they were admitted to eat
off the passover.

Off this I say we learn / that now no man ought to be admitted to the Lords
table and to the holy communion / but he that is known by his open profession
to be off true Religion: for As Much as the body excels the shadow / and
the Truth the figure / So much more carefully ought we to take heed / that
the Sacraments / wherein we have the truth / and the body it selffe / be not
communicated with uncircumcised and unclean persons. So that diligent
Inquisicion is to be had off every man what says he holds and how he
serves God / lest we communicate them with any who profess not the same true
Religion off Christ.

Which was so well taken heed unto in the primitive church / that Eusebius
reportethe in his Ecclesiastical history / 6. Book of his Ecclesiastical
history.
that a Roman Emperor named Philippe who f^rst became Christian off all the
Emperors / and first submitted the roman Empire unto Christ) desyringe to
communicate with the rest off the church / was not admitted thereunto by the
Bishop off that church (for that he was yet suspected for diverse causes)
before that he had openly made profession off true Religion / And in those our
days / in these churches which have received the Doctrine off the Gospel and
true discipline together / as in old time no man was suffered to eat off the
Passover / being either a stranger or a hired servant unless he had his
part in the lamb / So likewise in the holy Communion off the Lords supper /
Christ the true paschall lamb is communicated only to such (as far as men
can judge by there outward profession) unto whom Christ him selffe belongethe.

Now the^ / seeing we have a law touching this matter off no less weight then
theyrs / why do we suffer yt to Remain in the book off the gospel / as in a
scabbard / and suffer the edge off yt to wax dull / now fyften years together?
why do we communicate the holy Sacraments with the Papists / and require not
before they be admitted a sincere / open / and franck Confession off true
Religion? The holy Mysteries off God are profaned / The Gentles enter into
the Temple off God / The holy things are indifferently communicated with
clean and unclean / cyrcuncised and vncyrcuncised / and yet we s^t no porters
at the church doors / nor shut up the unclean and polluted together by them
selves. Therefore / Let this so necessary a part off Eclesiasticall discipline
be established Let an open profession off true Religion be exacted of those /
who are admitted to the use off holy things: and Let no longer the heavenly
mysteries off God be profaned / by communycating them with the Papists.

The next thing which is to be noted out off these places / which I have
alleged belongs unto those / who are in deed heirs off the promises / and
as Saint Peter speaks in the Acts Sons off the Testament and covenant made
with the Fathers / but yet for some fault made / are for a time excluded from
the use off holy things. Act. 3.2^.
And hitherto belongs that example which I alleged out off the ix. off
Nombres / off those who were put over unto the second monethe before they might
eat the Passover.

Touching which kind off punishment / all though there be nothing expressly
mentioned and commanded in the gospel / yet seeing it is commanded in the fifth
off Matthew / that he at whom a brother is offended / bringing an offering to
the altar of the lord should leave his offering there and goo first and be
reco^c^led to his brother / how much more ought this to be done / where the
Anger has been so hot / that it has broken out into reprochefull and
contumelious words / E^^^. 5.24.
and such as our Savior manifestly declares to be such as the Counsel off
the church has to deal with? Mat. 5.^2.
that is to say / That they be commanded to abstain from the altar off the
lord / until they be reconciled with there brother who is offended. For
otherwise If without reconciliacion they offer there gift / the offringe is
profaned and they that do such things / are giltye off great offense / and
for a small fauit that was made before / have now committed a great and a
heinous trespass. For so the law threateneth to that unclean person / that
durst touch the holy flesh / and eat of the sacrifices / that he should
surely pay for it / and that no other sacrifice should serve to take away his
sin^e / but eue^ his own blud: Levi. 7.18.
Math. 5.26
As also our Savior Christ threatens in the gospel / that they which
reconcile not them selves / shall surely pay for it / even to the uttermost
farthing. And S Paul says that they that drink and eat the Lords body
unworthily / eat and drinck there own damnation.

Seeing the^ it is so and that the lord is so grievously displeased with the
neglectinge off these duties / and profanation off his holy mysteries /
Seeing also that those men the^ selves who do thus boldly profane them / do
make them selves gilty by this means of more grievous judgment and
condenmnatio^ / this part off discipline also being no less necessary then the
other / which we want now to long time / is to be restored again: and the
keepinge off it to be as much esteemed / as we esteem and set by the heavy
judgments of god / and his wrath punishinge and reue^ginge the prophanatio^
of his holy mysteries.

For let no man here object unto me the Bishops Consistory / and the Official
/ and Co^missarie geuinge charge from the Bishop to be reco^cyled and
punishinge by the purse such as do offend / as if we wanted not those things
that I say we want / for all those are but toys and trifles / which seeing it
has abolished the lawful man^er of taking away off offenses / appointed by
our Savior Christ to be kept in his church / what hope can we look for / to
have any wholesome remedy by these means off so dangerous diseases? Therefore
Let there be a lawful Counsel establyshed in the church / and Let them use
that authority / which they have appointed them off the Lord / for the
thrustinge back off Profane and unclean persons / off the keepinge chaste and
pure the service off god / off taking away off offenses / and prouidinge off
meet remedies for every fault and transgression.

Now remains the other part touching excommunication / a large point and
off great weight and use in the church: but so much the more fowlie abused as
the right use off yt / is good and profitable. But as I purposed / touching
only those faults which are committed in our discipline in this behalffe / I
will omit all other: and first off all I pass over them who take away all
use off excommunication / and contend that it is not necessary in a Christian
church. For our men who retain yet still such a kind off excommunication as
they have received from the papists deny not that there is some use off yt /
but rather contrarily do prove it to be necessary thinking it better to use
this being as yt were a leaden sword / then none at all. Although / that which
shall be alleged by me out of the Scriptures touching the lawful use hereoff /
shallbe sufficient to co^nfute them also / who do deny any use off yt at all.

Excommunication therefore is a sentence given by the Assembly off the Elders /
whereby the party that is convicted off some grievous crime and offense / and
can by no means be brought to repentannce / being first forbidden to come to
the lords table / with out prescription off any other certain time then off
his repentance / is driven out from the church / and cut off from the
communion and fellowship off the faithful.

This part of Ecclesiastical censure as also the first were translated unto us
from the Jews. For the church off Christ / in all this matter off discipline
has received all her laws and decrees from the Jews: for as it has been
showed before / It is plain and manifest / that our Savior in the xviij. M^^
17.18
off Matthew alluded to the manner off the Jews / because that otherwise his
speech should have been very obscure / and such as no man had be^ able to
understand. But this appears most manifestly by the excommunication off the
blind man in the ix. off John / and by the xvij. off the same Gospel / where
Christ geuethe the Apostles warninge / that they should be excommunicate for
his sake.

Some fetch the Original hereoff even from Adam whom the Lord cast out off
Eden / and set an Angel at the entrye / who by shakinge the blade off a
glistering sword fraied him from entering in / and suffered him / not to taste or
touch that tree which was a Sacrament off life unto him. Such a like thing
also the Hebrewe Interpretours observe off Cain / whom the Lord with a certain
curse cast out off the Land where his Father Adam dwelt: which place was nere
unto Eden / and had certain undoubted tokens off the presence and favor off
god remaning in it. For that there was certeiteine place there wherein the
sacrifices were offered / Aben Ezra / does learnedly note upon this where yt is
said off Cain and Abell / that they brought there oblations to offer / which
must needs be understood That they brought them to a certain place: and in the
same chap. Caine complains / thathe is cast out from before the face of
god. Further also some shadow hereoff apperethe in the Leepers / who for there
leprosye were cast out off the city.

And surely those be no obscure and dark shadows / but plainly and lyuelie do
represent unto us the nature off excommunication / if they be well and narowly
observed: which not withstandinge is set forth more plainly in the xvij. off
Genesis where the lord institutinge the sign off circumcision / for a seal off
the covenant made between him / and Abraham / and his seed / threateneth that
the contemner off this sign / that shall refuse to be circumcised / shallbe
shut out from the covenant / and to be cut off from the people / with whom he
had made his covenant / and to be esteemed as one that had been borne emonges
the other profane nations.

Afterward also this covenant being renewed with the Israelites under the
law / as the promises were signed with moo seals / and as they were assured
off them by moo means / So this cutting off which they call Carith is more
often times threatened and mentioned: which / that yt was the same in the time
off the law / that our excommunication is now / appears by that that the
very forms of speaki^g and the names theroff / are borrowed from it / and
translated unto ours. For what other thing is yt / to be an ethnik and a
publican / by which kind of speakinge Christ notes excommunication and that
also which is in the ix. John 9.17.
of John / To be cast out off the Synagogue / and those manners off speaking
used in this case by the primitive church / To be cast out from the Communyon
off the faithful. To be banished. And to be, acompted strangers from the
church, And that which Paul says in the first to the Corinthes. chap. 5.2.
That he may be taken out from emongs you, and the 8. verse Put out that wicked
man from emonges you / what other thing I say is declared in all these kinds
off speakinge / but that which is so often repeared in the law / To be be cut
off from Israel and te be cut off from his people* Yea further / both our
Savior Christ in the 18. off Matthew and the 8. Galat. 5.12 Act. 3.24.
verse / and S. Paul to the Galathians / and S Peter in the Acts / seem
manifestly to allude / to this name off Cutting off.

That same also which is in the 9. off No^bres where the lord threatening that he
shall be cut of from his people that eareth off his sacrifice after yt was
offered / says / that his sacrifice shall proffit him nothing / nor be
accounted to him to take away his sin, but that his sin shall remain
still upon his own head, and be punyshed upon him selffe, For so Aben Ezra
does expound yt: or as man might peradventure turn the words and more fytlie
/ He threatens / that such a one shall bear his own sin.

^en. 18.15
And that same also in the xviij. off Deuteronomye / where threatninge the same
cuttinge off / to the contemner off the Prophet which should be sent / I vvilll
require, says he, his sin at his hands: what other thing do these two kind
off speeches signify / then the words off Bynding and not Forgiving Sins,
which are used by our Savior Christ in the xviij off Matthew in this behalffe?
Last off all does not Saint Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthes and 5.
chap. the 6.7. and 8. verses / seem to have taken the ground and foundation
off that excommunication from that Cutting off, which is mentioned in the 12.
off Exodus the 15. and 19. verses? And very properly and fitly to have
translated yet thereunto? For whereas Moses had threatened that he should be cut of
from his people / who duringe the seaue^ days of his Passover had any leaven
in his house / but only sweet bread / Saint Paul making our whole life to
answer to those 7. days off the Passover / and Christ to be our Paschall
Lamb / the house to be the Assembly and Company off Communicantes (as also
some off the Hebrew interpretors expound yt) Sweat bread / to be synceritie
and true the / and Leaven / to be maliciousnes and wikednes / seems he not I
say to ground and gather herevppon / that that same Corinthian / who in the
time off the feast off our true Passover had that leaven found in his house /
that is to say had so grievously sinned after the profession off Christian
Religion / was to be cast out off the church? And having changed a little the
manner off Speaking, / he adds in the same place / that this old leaven was
to be purged out from the church off God / which he calls a new Lump and
Sweet / or unleavened bread. Herebye therefore / as I think yt is plainly
proved / both that the use offexcommunication has been at all times
necessary in the church / and also that is was first translated unto us from
he Jews by Lord him selffe. And that yt was afterward used by the Apostles
and since the Apostles time even unto this age / in the church off God /
Allthoughe myserablye depraved and corrupted in this later age wheruppon I
conclude that it ought to be used in Christian churches when time and occasion
does serve.

Further / it has been declared hereby what excommunication is / and what the
force and nature off it is namely that yt cutteth off from the church / (that
is to say that company which professes the true service off god) the party
against whom such a sentence is given / and depriueth him from the blessed
hope ^ff the children off God and waiting for the promises / together with the
signs and seals theroff: which both promises and Sacraments / are given to
the church alone. So that by this / as it was in that most grievous sentence
and condemnacion off the Romans spoken off before / all the rightes
privileges and freedoms off a citezin off the cyty off God / are clean lost
and taken away / and so much the more grievous is this sentence to be esteemed
/ that whereas he that had lost his fredom in Rome might have been denyzed into
some other free town or place: but he that loses the freedom off this city
/ can not be received as Denison into any other free state or common welthe /
but being cast out off the kingdom off god is delivered to the kingdom off
darcknes and to extreme bondage / seeing there is no mean / but that he who is
not off the one kingdom must be off the other as does appear in the example
to the Colossians.

Colos. 1.13.
Therefore our Savior Christ / declares that by this sentence a man is
pronounced to be an ethnic and a publyca^ which being spoken in respect off
the Jews / is as as much as one should say now in respect off the Christians
/ a Panym a Saracene / or a Turcke. And Saint Paul / declares it to be a
delyuering to Satan: whereupon also we are commanded in the Epistle to the
Thessalonians / that we have not to do with the^ who are such / which
Sentence the more grievous yt is / and how much more terrible this sword is /
then that the Angel shaked before Adam to fear him with all: ^. Corr. 5.5 ^ Thessalonians. ^.^.14.
So much the more care and heed is to be taken here / against whom we
pronounce such a sentence / against whom we draw out so sharp ^n edged sword:
lest that if it be against and Innocent / or one that is not guilty off some
heinous offense and unrepentant / we make our selves by prophaninge / the most
holy and sacred Justice off god / gyltie off his heavy judgment and
displeasure. Therefore this sword is to be handled and ruled by the word and
commandment off the high Judge / and to be drauen out only against them /
against whom he shall command it to be drauen / neither is so sharp a kind
off surgerie to be used to the curing off the rest off the body / except yt
evidently appear that some member be clean rotten / and putrified.

Wherein lest we should offend by any error / certain express rules are given us
/ which do fully set out all the order whereby we ought to proceed in this
case. Mat. 18.17
For our Savior Christ declares generally that every one who shall be
disobedient unto the church / exhorting him to acknowledge / and bewail his
offenses / should be holden as an ethnic and a publican. Tit. 3.10.
And Saint Paul more particulerly declarethe an heretic is be excommunicated
/ A schismatike / a Blasphemer an Idolater / or he that offendethe so grievously
in ma^ners that he is an incestuous person or a fornicator or guilty off any of
those crimes which are rehearsed in the first Epistle to the Corinthes the v.
chap. and the xj. verse and to the Thessalonie in the ij. Epistle the iij.
chap. and ij verse.

For allthoughe (as our Savior Christ most wisely and worthelie handles this
matter in the xviij. off Math.) yt be better that one member be cut off then
that all the body do perish / yet where the case is concerning the cutting
off / off some part off our body / or off pulling out the eye / we ought to
considre first diligently / yff there be any hope to recover yt again. yff
there be any medicine that may do yt good: yff the public fast off the
church as a certene spiritual diet off the whole body may remedy it: finally
wither yt be altogether putrified and rotten / so that the part must needs be
plucked away or cut of that the rest of the the body may be preserved before
we suffer yt to be pulled out or cut off from the body. Yea futhermore
allthoughe it plainly appeerethe to be putrified / and that the sore be
altogether desperate and past hope of remedy / yet notwithstanding we ought
not to mayme the body / or put out the eye / although that part and membre be
become unprofitable / nay although yt be hurtful and and noisome to the rest
/ without great grief and sorrow off the whole body / nor without sense and
feelinge / and natural compassion off so great a myserie.

In which behalffe / as the Papists were wont most grievously to offend when as
for every light cause / and even for not payinge the Official or some Officer
off his court some shillinge or two or other duties / men that were otherwise
very honest and godly had both other sentences / and even this most grievous
emonges all / given against them. So that to this day this notable corruption
off this deuyne Justice is not corrected nor amended: But even as yt was wont
to be in time off darkness / matters off lest weight and importance are punyshed
with those grievous and fearful sentences. But seeing that the Edge both off
the other sentences and also off this which is most grievous / is the
commanndement off god / and that not only one off the Bishopps officers / but
all men alive are not able to cut off from the church / whom Christ from
heaven does quicken which his spirit as a membre off. his body / there is no
cause why any man should fear that sentence / as if it were this thunderbolt
which I have described.

But as there has been fault into much lightness and rashenes / and
pronouncinge so heavy sentences without just cause / so there has been no less
fault in this / that by negligence this wholesome seuerytie when just cause and
occusion requires / is not executed. For that means being taken away which
the Lord would have exercised in his church and whereby offenses are to be
provided for / and the whole authority translated from the consistorye and
company off the Elders / to the Bishop and his court / where the Pastor must
come to plead / yff he will heart from the communion such as are to be put
back by the word off god the holy mysteries off god are with great license and
without any punishment daily profaned / the holy things are prostituted and
set open to Adulterers / fornicators / drunckerds / and all kind off vicious
and sinful livers / and (which our Savior forbiddethe) precious sto^nes are
cast before hogs / and swine. And the holy mysteries not only profaned by
taking away off this means whereby they might be kept from these pollutions and
propanacio^s but the church also is brought into an undoubted danger / For
as much as it is to feared / lest that the rest off the body be infected with
the same contagion: and even they them selves who be such / heap and doble
their conde^nacion / for that they dare take in hand to be so bold tho come in
such sort unto the lords table.

For besides that the worship and service off god is preserved and kept chaste /
pure / and undefiled by this severity / the whole church also and even the
parties them selves who are guilty are best by this means provided for. And
that the church is thus preserved / the Apostle plai^ly shows whereas willing
them to cast out the leaven / he gives them warninge / that the whole lump is
sone sowred with a little leaven. And that this also does apperteine to the
benefit and safety off the gilty parties S. Paul shows / noting this to be
the end off deliueringe the incestuous man unto Satan / that his soul might be
saved in the day off the Lord. 1. Cor. ver. 6.
1. Cor. 5.5.
And again where he says / that they ougt to be contented with that
correction which had been done / lest that peradue^tur the party should be
swallowed up with to much grief. 2. Cor. 2.7.
Whereby we see / that this a medicine / rather then a deadly punishment: a
sharp and bitter medicine in deed / But we must remember that no remedy is so
grievous as that which is most healthful and wholesome.

Saying therefore excommunication has so profitable / necessary ^od wholesome
uses in the church / let it be restored to us again and established in such
sort as is described by the word off God / Let the holy Sacraments off god be
carefully kept from all pollucion and and prophanacion / Let the leaven be
purged and cast out off the church / that we may be a new lump as we are
unleavened and sweet bread as the Apostle witnesses. Let us procure
diligently the health off those members which be in danger / that we enter not
lame / and maimed / but whole into that life / which by the word off God we
hope for. Let the Angel off God therefore / be set at the gate off Eden / that
with his sharp and glistering sword he may keep back all polluted and
unclean persons from tastinge or touching off the tree off life. Let the
safety off the church be procured and sought for by this kind of purgation /
and the amendeme^t off such as go astray / by these remedies: sharp in deed
and unpleasant but wholesome notwithstanding and proffitable.

Thus in those two kinds or sorts / all manner off kinds off Ecclesiastical
discipline and remedyinge off offenses / is contained: onles some man think
good that / that execration be added which S. Paul denounces and threatens
in the first to the Corinthians and the last chap. against all those who love
not the Lord Jesus: ^. Cor. 16.1.22. Galat. 1.2.8.^.14.
and to the Galathians against such as preach any other Gospel: which S.
Jude out off Enoch seems to thunder against all the wicked. Which if any man
so take and referr to excommunication / Saint John seems to allude to the
necessary use off excommunication in the church / were (as it seems out off
Zachary who had prophesyed that in the kingdom of Christ there should no more
be any Cananite in the Land) he declares that in this cyty which he describes
in the xxij. chap. there should no more be any accursed thing / as also in the
xxj. chap. and xxvij. ver. and the 22. chap. the 25. ver. he alludeth to the
same thing / whereas he say that no profane or abominable thing / no dogs /
inchaunters fornicators / ^c. shall enter into the cyty.

But that seems to be more then a Medicine / and to be rather a sentence off
death and a threatening off the last Judgment without hope off forgyuennes:
And some think yt agrees rather to the vices them selves then to any certain
persons: as also the Apostle denounces the^ not against certain men but
generally against the wicked and reprobate. Although the primitive church
pronounced this sentence even against certain me^ / as Socrates declares in his
history / that Nestorius was accursed by the church men / which curse / says
he we Christianes are wont to call the sentence that is pronounced against a
blasphemer / when as if it were graven upon some pille^ / we publishe this
sentence to all the world. The seventh book of his Eccles^asticall h^^tory.
Which if we take in this sense / yt seems so to answer to excommunication /
as Destruction. Which the Hebrews call Abaddon / does answer to that excision
and cutting of which they call cares / Which has been spoken off before.
Touching which Destruction the Hebrew interpretours confess that they know
not certainly what it is / yet they do prove plainly that it is an other kind
off punyshement distinguished from the other / and off more grievous and certain
destruction.

And let thus much suffice to have been spoken of the chief and sovereign
authority off the Assembly off the Elders in the government off the church:
whereby we may see by which of the three states of lawful government (which are
/ where one is sovereign / or more / or all) the church is governed. For
as much as the state and kind off government / is esteemed off the sovereign
whither he be one / moo / or the commynaltie / Therefore for as much as all
things are ordered and governed by the authority off certain chosen men who are
chief in the congregation in godliness and vertewe / we may call the government
off the church / Aristocratie that is / that government and state wherein a
few off the best do bear the rule: or rather Theocratie that is the
government off god / seeing that they have no authority to do any thing but by
the word and commandment off god.

But these chosen and picked out me^ / do so exercise this authority / that
they do well understand they execute no civil nor politic government / but
that they so rule over the people off god: that there be no violence nor tyranny
used: or such like / as commonly is used in that state / which degenerating
from the government of a few off the best / comes to a few off the richest:
but that they adioyne also to there own authority (especially in matters off
great weight as in choosinge / or deposinge off any Ecclesiastical Officer /
or in suspendinge or excommunicatinge any man) the consent and agreement off
all the people. For we read it to have been thus done / eue^ from the Apostles
times until that Discipline was corrupted / as appears in the Acts off the
Apostles written by Saint Luke / and the Ecclesiastical history off the
primitive church. So that in this respect yt seems that the church is
governed rather by all / then by a few. And therein to resemble that state off
government wherein the co^minaltie is the chief. Which society must needs be
governed by a heavenly order / for it is the best state off all whereas all
these three meet in one kind off government: as both Plato thought and Aristotle
and the other chief and excellent Philosophers: that state I say / wherein all
the cytezins obediently submit them selves to god which commands / as king
and monarche / and the assembly which decrees by his will and authority /
where also the assembly decrees no weighty matter without the consent and
approbacion off the rest off the church and people.

Neither is this the manner of government off parish churches only / but the
same is also kept where more churches are either for that they be nighe
togeether / or because they are all subject to the same Magistrate / or for
there common proffit and commodty / join togeether / and make as yt were one
body. For off this sort also be all the assemblyes which are gathered for the
government off the church: both those which are called Conferences and Synodes
wither they be less Synodes / such as they were wont to have twice a year in
every province / or greater which are gathered to geether by the authority off
any one whole kingdom / free state / or common wealth: or else off mo
kingdoms and countries. For the souerantie allwais reserved unto Christ by
whose word all things are governed as in a Monarchy / The counsel or Assembly
off Elders as in the second state off government which I described before /
decrees by common counsel and authority / that which is for the wealth and
commodity off the church: the people with all good will allowing off the
godly just and honest determinacions off the Assembly / or making them void
and off none effect / yff they be not such / as in the last ststate wherein the
people has to rule and govern.

Off which Assemblye both Conferences and Synodes of both sorts / although
many things might be said very necessary and profitable for the use off our
church / to which nothing could be more profitable then these assemblies being
so used as they are appointed to be used by the word off god and used by other
purer and better reformed churches (as contrariwise nothing does more hurt
then these Synodes visitacions and conuocations / which are come into there
places / which as we use them are full off infinity abuses wherein almost no
other thing is talked of or detreed but of square cappes copes and surplises /
what fashion the ministers gown and cloak must be off an such like trifles)
yet seeing this hangs off that which has been already spoken off the
government off particular churches / and the more full handling off those
things may be taken out of the learned writings of some off our days which
have lately written / touching this matter / passinge this thus briefly over /
let us return again to the assembly and company off Elders / which seeing I
have declared both to have been instituted by our Savior Christ and to be very
necessary for the preseruacion off the church / because that thereby
controversies are ended / offenses are taken away / the church being purged is
delivered from the fear off the punishment off god / the Sacraments are kept
holy and undefiled / finally all things are done seemly and orderly as the
Apostle commands to be done in the church off god / By what subtelty off
Satan and negligence of our selves are our churches bereaved off so singular
and heavenly a benefit? can any man deny but that Christ has thus appointed
that this assembly should thus govern in his church? if there be any man
that can deny it / Let him tell us what the meaning is off these words / Tell
the Assembly in the xviij. off Matthew: or what keys / that is to say what
power off openinge and shutting off heaven / off bindinge or losinge sin our
Savior speaks off in that place: 2. Timo. 4.^4. ^. Peter. 5. ver. 1. 1.
Corr. 23.23. 1 Thessalonians. 5.12. ver. Heb. 13.17. Act. 15.2.20.17. Mat. 18.7.
Or what that Assembly off Elders is which Paul in his Epistle to Tymothy
speaks off: or what Elders they be that he speaks off in the chap.
following. And Peter likewise in his Epistle / who they be that to the
Corinthians he calls governors. To the Thessalonians Rulers and Ouersers:
And who they be whom the Apostle to the Hebrews says / to be set over the
congregation unto whom he wills them to be obedient / and to submitt them
selves: And who they be also whom Saint Luke in the Acts calls the Elders
off the church off Jerusalem and off Ephesus? would they have us prove that it
is necessary? Let them teach us contrary to that which our Savior Christ has
given us warning off) that yt is not necessary that offenses should arise: or
else show some better means how to redress them or take away when they be
risen / then that which our Savior has appointed / which is to be exercised
by the Assembly: Let them show it to be a needles care to keep the Sacraments
impolluted and undefiled? or if they confess yt to be needful / let them
teach us some better way to do yt by then that which our Savior Christ has
taught us already.

For I think there is no man off any sound Judgment / that will say / That
which we use now is fytter for this purpose: that is to say / that one Bishopp
and he not oftentimes by him selffe / but by his Chancellor and he by his
Surroga^e / should take him so selffe all this authority / alone rule / as he
lists / in stead off a lawful Assembly off Elders / who by common counsel
and authority should govern the church For as I declared before the Bishop
took upon him the office off Deacons / that they being taken away he might
distribute the church goods all alone / and how after also taking upon him
the office off the Elders / when he had likewise thrust ou^ them / he took
upon him alone all the care off the church: So here also he has abolished the
whole Assembly that he alone may be asked Counsel off / he alone may have
knowledge / judge and determyne off all matters. For he spreads him selffe
over all the body / even as the eye which S. Paul speaks off in the first to
the Corinthes: For as the eye will have no ear nor hearing in the body / no
nose nor smellinge / no hands nor fealinge / finally nothing but the Eye and
saying / So the Bishop cutteth off the Deacons / as the hands from the body /
takes away the Elders who do necessarily serve to smell out and understand
many matters / abolisheth the Assembly / as if he should stopp up the ears
which are appointed for the hearing off controversies / and finally has
destroyed the whole body / whiles he will have yt nothing but an eye: 1. Cor.
14.17.
neither will suffer either the Deacons or the Elders / or the Assembly / to do
any thing but only himself to hear handle and deal / with all manner
matters. But what a body is this which is nothing but an eye for as the Apostle
says / The whole body is not one member but many: 1. Cor. 12.13.17.
And if there be nothing but an eye / then where is the smellinge? where is the
hearing? where be the hands? and where be the other parts / Surely God made
the body otherwise / appointed to every membre his office and function. Neither
can the Bishopp say unto the Deacon no more then the Eye unto the hand that he
has no need off him / seeing we see Apostles who were the clearest Eyes which
ever were had need off the Deacons help. Much less can I say that he has
no need off the Elders / or off the whole assembly.

Neither durst the Bishops arrogate thus much to them selves in the
beginning / but by little and little / as Ambition / and dysyre off bearinge
rule did increase in them / and the care off the church did decrease in there
fellows / at the last they came to this unspeakable pride. Whereunto this was
the first step / when as the name off a Bishopp which is common to all other
ministers and there fellows / as yet appeerethe in the xx. off the Acts
began to be attributed to one alone / who was chosen by the rest to this end
that he might propound the matters which were to be handled unto the Assembly /
and gather the voices / and bear as yt were that office which the Consul did
in the Senate off Rome. But as yet he was chosen by the rest / and that not for
ever but for a time: And although he had the honor off the name / yet for
other things he used no private authority neither took unto him selffe any
more geuinge off voices or determyninge off matters / then any off the rest /
he contynewed still in the common care and chardge off all the Assembly / to
watch and over see the flock / and was careful also off his own particular
dewty / to preach and to teach the people / neither pretended the charge off
the common care which he had with the rest / to make yt a cloak for his ydlenes
and to live at ease and leave his proper and peculier charge off preaching /
but kept still his own church / as his standinge upon the wall / so that yet
hither to every thing But only the Arrogatinge off the name off Bishopp unto
him self was tolerable. But afterward when as by the negligence and
ignorance off Bishopps and ministers / there were but a few / who were meet
to handle such matters / and many were unlearned / some also idle / and
negligent / and cared not for the church / then began this authority and
charge touching the Discipline off the church / to be almost wholly given
unto one: which occasion Ambition took / and seeing the time to serve so fit
for the purpose / hoised up the sails unto honor: So yt became a perpetual
office / whereas before they were chosen unto yt for a time: And all matters
were governed and ruled by one man's Authority alone / and no more by the
voices off his fellows / and off the Assembly.

But afterward / that darkness encreasinge / and covering all the church / when
as few fit Mynisters were to be found not only in one town or city / But in
some whole country or province / the Tyranny grew greater and increased still
/ and brought under the subjection off one man / all the churches which were in
a whole Dioces: wheruppon the charge off a particular and as we will call yt a
parish church / was shaken off under pretense off this great burden off the
oversight off so many churches: So that they left unto them selves no more off
the true office off a Bishop and mynistery then that served for there honor /
that is / they reserved only so much / that they might speak to the people /
where / and in what church / and when they would.

Thus they usurped all the authority off the Assembly yea over the Assembly /
ruling them as they listed / chosing and putting out whom they would / until
at the last the Assemblies were clean taken away / and the churches off every
Dioces / had Lords set over them. But ambition which as the flame or fire /
goes vpwardes still / and cannot be kept with in any bands / stayed not thus
in Dioces and small provinces / But ascended up to greater / from whence come
our Metrapolitanes who were called Archbishopps (and first begann that
Authority to be given them in their name / which in deed they had usurped
before / Then from the greater provinces and Archebishoprickes they came higher
/ to the rule off all the churches in a whole kingdom / whervppon they were
called primates. Then the whole church thoroughe out the world was ruled by a
Quadrumvirat / that is by four / who had the chief charge off all the world /
and were called Patriarchs / until at the last Antychrist by these stairs
went up to the throne off god / and sat him down in the midst off the
church / as Paul had prophesied / and boasted him self as god. 2 Thessalonians. 2.4.


This is the true history off the confusion off Ecclesiastical offices: This
was the cradle and the beginning off the Ambition off church men: Thus they
grew forewardes up and increased: whereby if we perceive all things to be so
out off order / that the state off the whole body is to be feared by yt / Let
us at the last give warninge to our Prymat / to our Metropolitanes / and to our
Lord Bishops / that yff they think yt a shameful and an ambytious thing /
and vnbesceminge the modesty off the servant off Christ and off a true Pastor
/ for the pope to take the Authorytye off General Counsels / and to suffe
nothing to be done nor decreed in them but what he only does or allows /
that I say / yff they think this shameful in the pope to do to general
Counsels / they would not play the petipopes in Conuocations or provincial
Synods / and taking away the liberty off the Ecclesiastical Synodes and
Assemblies / rule / govern / and apoint all alone by tyranny / lest they seem
not to have desired to deliver the church clean out off Bondage / but only to
change the master / and to make it become subject unto them / and to have
sought only that we should have no foreign popes / not that we should have
none at home / or none altogether / and rather to have abhorred the pope off
Rome / then the popedom yt selffe.

Let them remember at the last / that they have as great need (if they do there
duties) off the help off Deacons as the Apostles had: Let them remember that
the body would be destroyed / yff there were no member in yt but the eye: And
that church in like manner wherein no man bears any office but the Bishopp:
Let them remember that god has so made the body / that there is a merueilous
necessary use off the diverse members theroff: which variety off parts and
members must needs be preserved / yff we would have the body whole /
healthful and strong. Let this infinite Ambition and desire off rule / and
off medlinge with every thing that is in the Lord Bishops / be corrected:
Let the Consistory and Assembly off the Elders being so necessary and so
profitable for all the affairs off the church / be established: wherein they
may have indeed / the first place in respect off the worthiness off there office
/ S that they leave the second to the Doctors and the third to the Elders. For
the church perceive the how hurt full a thing yt is / that they should take
all unto them selves and can bear yt no longer / perceiuinge well that the
shamfull prophanacion off the Sacraments / the manifold and intolerable
abuses off excommunication / which is the highest Justice off the church / and
other innumerable euilles flow and spring from no other fountain then from
this pride off the^^^ and busy meddling / very hurtful and dangerous / for the
state off the church. And thus much off Ecclesiastical officers / off whom
because I have spoken more at large / how they ought to be appointed / for that
in the appoyntinge off them Ecclesiastical discipline does in a manner wholly
consist / I will recompense yt with the shortenes off that part which
follows: which is touching the dewtie off all the Saints and faithful.

Under the name off the Saints are contained all the rest off the church /
which do not exercise any public office or function therein / whose dewtie as
in all other societies is only this / to suffer them selves willingly to be
ruled and governed by those / whom god has set over them whereunto there is a
short / but a notable and pithy exhortacion off the apostle to the Hebrevvs:
Heb. 15.1^
wherein he exhorts them and by them all other churches / to obedience unto
them who have the oversight off the^ / that they may give up their acco^pte of
the charge off sowles which they have taken in hand with joy and comfort /
and that they may readily and with good courage / bear for the churches sake
/ all such labor / grees / cares / and sorwes as are joined unto there offices.

Neither let Magestrates think (allthough in respect off there civil authority
the church be subject to them) that in this behalffe / they are to be exempted
from this precept and commanndement off the Appostle / who charge every one
to be subject to those who in Lord are set over them / for seeing they ought to
be careful as well off the salvation off the Magystrate as off others / and
that the soul off the magystrate / as well as of the rest / is committed to
their charge. They must also as well as the rest submit them selves and be
obedient to the just and lawful authority off the Officers off the church.
For saying they not only rule by the authority off Jesus Christ / but in a
manner do represent his person / seeing they rule not as they / them selves list
according to there own will / but only according to this word and
commandment / Is it not meet that even kings and the highest magystrates
should be obedient unto them? For yt is meet that all the princes and Monarchs
off the world should give up their sceptres and crowns unto him / whom god
had made and appointed the Heir off his kingdom and Lord off heaven and
earth.

I might allege hear out off the histories off all times diverse examples off
godly princes who submitted them selves to the order and government off the
church appointed by god. Who allthoughe as touching this life they did rule and
govern / yet they despised not the discipline and correction off the Lord / I
might name out off the most ancient historye and holy Chronicles off the
Hebrevvs / king Azarias who allthoughe he proudely and boldly usurped the
priesthood / yet when he was stryken by the Lord with a Leprosy / and was
therefore cast out of the temple and separated from the common society off men
by the high priest according to the law which God had made therein / He
obeyed the priest co^mandinge / according to God his word / and letting his
son rule is his stead passed the rest of his life in solitarines alone by
himself. 2. Chro. 26 21.


Among the Christian Emperors / allthoughe there be many worthy examples which
now a days Princes may set before them to follow / yet those two which the
ecclesiastical story reherseth off Philipp the first Christian Emperor and off
Theodosius contain a singular example above the rest off godly subjection:
Eusebius. 4. book off his eccles. story
wheroff the one being commanded to abstain from the Sacraments until he
had first professed him selffe to be a penitent (for that he had committed
certain faults) and had made open protestacion off his Religion (for that he
was suspected) He willingly obeyed the Bishopp or rather the word off god: And
both protested openly his grefe and srowe for the sins he had committed / and
professed before all the church his faith and Religion.

Theodori^us in his 5. book off his ecclesiastical story.
The other that is Theodosius / being not admitted by Ambrose into the church /
into the which he would have come / did likewise so willingly obeie / that
prostratinge him selffe upon the grownd and pauement off the temple / in the
sight off god and his Angels and all the church / followinge the meeknes off
David reprehended off Nathan) declared the wu^derfull sorrow which he had for
his wiked fact and the slaughter committed at Thessalonica by his commandment
rehersing these words out off the Psalm. My soul did clean unto the
pauement. Therefore all the faithful and even the princes and magistrates them
selves ought to be subject to the word off god / and to Ecclesiastical
Discipline: and then is the church in flourishing estate / when both they /
who bear rule / do commannd according to gods word and the^ who be subjects
do willingly obey.

But the Magistrates have this proper and peculier to them selves above the
rest off the faithful. To set in order and establishe the state off the
church by there authority and to preserve and maintain it according to godds
will being once established Not that they should rule the Ecclesiastical
matters by their authority / for this belongs unto Christ alone and to him
he has committed this charge / but for as much as the Apostle teachethe / that
they are appointed off God / to thend that we may live a godly and a peceable
life / and that the kings off Israel by the apointement off god had charge to
see the execution off all the law / they ought to provide / and see that the
service off god be established as he has appointed / and administered by such
as ought to administre the same / and afterward preserved in the same
simplicity and sincerity undefiled. 1. Timo. 1.2. Deu. 17 18.19.


In which so worthy an office / Godly Princes now a days may choose out of
the holy history many paterns to look upon and to follow / as David, Solomon,
Ezechias, Josias, Zerubabell, and others / whose labor was famous and notable
partly in apointinge the order off religion according to the word of god and
the voice of the prophets / partly in restoringe yt again / after it had
been decayed. By religion I understand / not only the doctrine which we
profess / touching the manner off serving god / and the obteininge of our
salvation by his sone^ but also the manner of gouerni^ge the church / of
apointing the Officers theroff / off correcti^ge and taking away off offenses:
which all / those most noble worthies did trewlie and according to the will off
god judge to belong to the office and dewty off the magistrate.

Whose worthy examples / O most noble Queen Elizabeth, if as your Majesty
has well begun^ / so you do continewe to follow / I hope surely / that for
the godly disposition theroff / both your honorable nobility and many notable
and famous men off the Ecclesiastical degree / and even the whole Parliament
will be ready to further / your Graces godly purpose: which bote the scriptures
do witness to have happened to David Solomon and other Religious Princes and
famous / (even for Religion and reformacions sake) in the like cause: And we
have also seen to have happened unto your Majesty not with out the devine and
merueilous providence off god at the abolishing off popery in the beginning
off your reign. Especially your Highness right honorable Counselors / and
chosen by your Majesty unto the bearinge off the chiefest offices in your
realm / will further this noble enterprise who every one / will choose unto him
selffe some worthy pattern out off the godly courts off those noble kings
for him to follow: in this behalffe: and some man peradventure Eliachim /
great steward off king Ezechias house. Some other Shaphan Chan^cellor in Josias
time: other the honorable Secretaries off king Salamon: And the rest some other
off the godly officers in David's and Salomons courts: finally all off them
choosinge to them selves some such patterns to follow in all virtue and
Religion / will strive which off them shall be most foreward to promote your
Graces godly decrees and purposes.

Seeing then that all will be so ready. O most noble Queen fynishe and make
perfect now at the last with the ready will and consent off all your Highenes
subjects / this heavenly worck off the service and Religion off god which
your majesty has bego^ne / and that not only by the example of these
excellent and famous kings / whom I have set before your eyes / but also by
the example off your Graces most noble Father Henry the viij. off most famous
memory / and off the most godly prince Edward the vj. your Highness brother /
that in the same family wherein the praise off religion and reformacion begann
to florishe / yt may be also perfected and finished by your majesty. For these
are almost the special praises off your Highness house and progeny / To
banishe Idolatry / and to set up the true service off god: whereby / the one /
that is to say the abolishinge off popery / we owe in a great part to your
highness most noble Father / the other / that is the restoringe off true
religion / first to your Highness most worthy brother that godly Prince Edward
the vj. and after also to your majesty / who as yt is written off the good king
Ezechias opened unto us again the doors off the temple of the Lord which had
been shut and closed up before / erected up his aulters again / which had been
beaten down / and lighted again the clear lamp off the word off the Lord
which had been put out. Which Princely vertewes off your Highness most worthy
house if your majesty crown with restoringe off lawful discipline unto the
church / which yet remains / Then shall our church of England most
worthelie acknowledge to have received her full liberty and perfect restoringe
again next after god / only to that most noble house wheroff your Highness is:
And confess to have found most true in that one famous house off Tedder her
estate / that worthy prophecy off Esaias. Kings shall be thy foster fathers and
Queens thy Nurces. which I pray God move your Graces heart to perform to the
honor off his most holy name / the edifying off this our church off England
and the discharge off your Highness dewty unto both and last off all to the
long and prosperous continuance off your majesty's reign over us.

Thus now the lawful and true discipline has been described: which
government of the church off Christ as off the Lords house / who so ever
diligently and attentively consider / shall easily perceive a merueilous
heavenly wisdom to shine in all the government of the same. And so much the
more merveilous then was the government off the house and court off Salamon /
weroff mention is made in the holy history off the kings / as he is wiser
then Solomon / who did appoint all the order and manner off the ordring off it.
1. King. 10.
For wither we consider the ordres and degrees off Officers / or there orderly
sitting down / or the diverse ornaments and apparel off every one / according
to his diverse estate and degree / we shall see / that nothing could be wisely
invented nor disposed with Judgment and reason either forth preseruacion off
the sure and safe estate off the church / or for beautifyinge and adorninge
the estimacion off the same / which is wanting in this government. For as
touching the Officers / what necessary office is omitted and neglected? or what
office needles and unnecessary is appointed? or what can be named more seemly
and orderly then this appointinge off the offices? That those functions
ceasinge which served but for a time / and were used extraordinarily in the
first years off the reign off our Savior Christ for the establishing off his
kingdom.

Ordinary and perpetual offices should be appointed in two sorts / wheroff
the first is such whereas every man has his several charge. The other / where
many have but one and the same charge which they execute by common counsel and
Authority. Wheroff again the first sort consists in ij. kinds / of
Bishopps (which expound and teach Religion and the service off god / that is
Pastors ad Doctors) and as many Deacons, (that is to say / Deacons and Elders /
so called figuratively by names which are more general. Off who^ some go
watch over the life and conversation off all the church / And the other are
careful to help the necessities off wydowes / strangers / sick folk / and
generally off all the poor: so that both all the house is sufficiently
provided for / as well touching the purity off faith and doctrine / as the
honesty and integrity off life and manners / and also the need and
necessity off every one particulerly not neglected.

Then / the consistory or the Assembly off Elders which consistethe of the
three first and chief Officers off the church / Pastors, Doctors, and Elders,
have the chief care and charge off this common wealth: to see that no office
want his officer / and how faithfully every one bears himself in doing off
his office / regarding all with one eye / how offe^ses may be avoided / and how
they may be remedied when they do arise / As for the placinge off every one in
his degree how honest and orderly is it? whereas all do generally reverence and
respect the Assembly / for their Authority: And every one knows his place
and degree / and lifts not him self / above his calling: But the Deacons
sitting down in the lowest Room / give place unto the Bishopps / who sitting
as Stevvards off the Lordshouse at the higher end off the table / envy not
other officers to sit together with them. And the Stewards also do so know them
selves to bear the same office / that notwithstanding the Pastors go before /
and the Doctors follow after: After whom next be the Elders / and in the last
place the Deacons / sitting notwitstandinge at the Officers table.

As for every man's garments and apparel / how seemly are they / how meet for
there callinges / and how precious and excellent? The common Araie off them all
/ is a certain godly and holy knowledge and profession off Religion / and an
undefiled life and co^uersacion: wherewith being clothed / as with those white
garments which Saint John mencioneth in his reuelacion they need no cloth off
gold our such like costly apparel to set them out with all. Yet besides this
common Array / every one carries the proper tokens and badges off his office:
For the Bishopps as the kings stewardes in stead off there staves / have
sound knowledge of the scriptures / besides which the Pastors have also that
moui^ge and percinge speech / whereby they have both power and authority to
strenghten and to terrefie / to comfort and to cast down again / as the Reye
off openinge and shuttinge / which Eliachim / great steward off king Ezechias
house / is described to bear upon his shoulder. (...) 1^.22.


As for the rest off the Deacons their several signs and marks / are
Diligence and Symplicitie: Which so merueilous government off the house off God
/ appointed by the most devine and heavenly wisdom / seeing it passethe above
measure the order off Salomons house with the love wheroff the Queen off Saba
was Ravished / the God off all mercy grant / that yt may much more rauishe
our most noble Queen and her right honorable Counselors with the love theroff
then the other did the Queen off the Sowthe and her Courtiers. For then shall
we be all most happy who live in the church as in the court off Christ our
true Solomon when we may allwais stand in his presence before him / and hear
him speak being the wisdom off his Father: Then shall we confess that king
Salamon does reign in deed / and that all things are true which the
Prophets prophesied touching his kingdom / when we see the church in this
order / when we see the Ministers and officers theroff thus araied and
appointed. For although as we say / the court is where the king is / So also
the church is where as Christ is present: And allthoughe this be the chiefest
end most principal / To hear the voice and wisdom off Solomon / yet it is
not possible / that he should tarry any long time in a place / that he appoint
not and set in order his Court according to his heavenly wisdom.

It may be that in time of his progress / where he soiourneth but for a short
time being ready by and by to depart again / that this whole order and
government off his court cannot so well be seen and appear: but it cannot be
that where he is purposed to dwell / and where he has chosen a certain place to
abide and continewe in / that he set not all things in order according to his
wisdom / meetest both for his state and majesty and for the perpetuity off
his reign. For which cause I am the more a fraid / lest that he be come into
England / as into some castle in the way off his progress for a small time
unless this confusion and disordre which commonly follows progresses be taken
away / and a certain and sure order off gouerninge the church be
established: for I cannot fully rejoice in the state off our church / until
that I see both for religion sownde faith and doctrine in Christ / and for
discipline / a commely and meet order off gouerninge the church / which Saint
paul reioised to see in the church off the Colossians. For the stable and
perpetual state and condition off the church standethe upon these ij pillars.

Wherefore I most humbly pray and beseech all men that have any care to
preserve and keep the kingdom off Christ emonges us / to deliver the true
service and worshipp off God to our posterity / that to their power every one
would seek for this lawful discipline off the church which I have described
and bo^he all seek to further yt with their good will and prayers / and
especially the ministers by preachinge and the Maiestrates by authority. As
for me I bynd my selffe as it were by this Obligation to god and to the church
/ that my labor and diligenc shall never be wanting in any thing that may help
and further by any means this reformation / which our Eyes dasell and our
sowles pyne away with so long looking and waiting for / which yff I may once
see / I shall thinck that part off any life the happiest / wherein so great a
benefit shall comme unto the church: but If I shall never see yt with mine
eyes / yet I am glad / that I have seen the form and pattern off it already
in my mind and left it to those that shall come after and so by the example off
David and Ezechiel / whose condition was not unlike in this behalffe / and by
the testimony off my conscience / that I have dischardged my dewty to my God /
and to our church: I will rest and confort my selffe herewithall / in the want
off that which with so great desyer I have longed for.

To God alone be honor and glory.
