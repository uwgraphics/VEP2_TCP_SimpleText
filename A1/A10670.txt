TO GREAT BRITTAYNES GREAT HOAPE, CHARLES, PRINCE OF WALES, etc.
SIR:
THis my ensueing Discourse of Votivae Angliae, which in a Manuscript I sent to
the King your Father, on New-yeares day last; I now (in zeal and humility)
direct and send to your Highness in Print; I wrote it then to his Majesty, in
favor of the neglected Estate, and dejected, and deplorable Fortunes, of the
most Excellent Princess (the Lady Elizabeth) your Sister; of the Illustrious
Prince Pallatyne her Husband, and their royal Progeny, for the unjust loss,
and shameful detention of their Pallatynat and Electorat, by the Trium-virat
of Usurpers, the King of Spain, the Emperor, and the Duke of Bavaria; I send
it now to your Highness, that (next under God) you (resembling your self) will
please to lend your best assistance and give your best furtherance, to draw
forth the King your Fathers Sword for the happy restitution and reconquering
thereof, whereunto the ties of Religion, Empire, and Honor, infalliblie oblige
him.

The eyes of the whole Christian world, (as so many Lines conducing to their
Center) are constantly and curiously fixed on the Glorious action, to see
whether Great Brittayne (in this just and famous quarrel) will courageously
resolve to redeem her lost Honor, or else cowardly consent to lose it
without any further sense, or hoape of redemption.

Your Highness cannot look on your self without seeing your Illustrious
Sister; nor see her without looking on her Princely Posterity, since you have
as deep Interest in their Blood, as your own heart has in you. O then how
can your Highness (whom Grace and Nature, your Blood and your Virtues, have
made one of the greatest Princes of the world) permit to see, or live to
permit; That these Austrian Princes (whose malice is as boundless as their
Ambition and Treachery) should, in a time of a firm and settled Peace, thus
perfidiouslie bereave them of their Honnors, and thus treacherously rob them
of their Inheritance and Patrimony, yea and reduce them to so extreme a
point of Calamity and Misery, that you are enforced to behold Pity* Grief,
Despair, and Ruin, to act their several parts upon the Stage, and Theater
of their afflictions. O that this Affront and Indignity, should be offered
them in the Reign of a King so Wise, and Potent, as your Father; and
tolerated in the life of a Prince so generous and magnanimous, as your
Highness, her Brother, yea her only Brother, as she is your only Sister.

But the King of Spain (the head and Oracle of the House of Austria) has not
only wronged the Princess your Sister in Germany, but your Highness likewise
in Spain, as if (in an inveterat and premeditated quarrel) he made it as well
his delight, as glory, to abuse, and seek the disgrace and ruin of the Blood
of Great Brittayne; Whereof I hoape your Highness, this Illustrious and famous
Parliament, and the thrice Noble Duke of Buckingham, has now made the King
your Father sensibly confident, as before he was confidentlie incredulous
thereof.

In a reciprocal requital and revenge whereof (because these manifestly
malicious affronts of Spain, toward our Souveraigne, and his Royal
posterity, are of too contemptible and pernicious a Nature, to be suffered;
and of too fatal and dangerous a consequence to be digested and tolerated)
all the Subjects of this Kingdom, (except those fiery Transalpine, and
factious Transmaryne English, who have only their bodies here, but their
hearts in Rome and Spain,) do vehemently desire War with Spain, as knowing
it necessary for our Estate, and safe and honnorable for our King, and his
Royal Posterity; yea, they all universally applaud this high and prudent
Court of Parliament, for motioning and seeking that War, infinitlie honor
your Highness for soliciting and advancing it, and exceedingly bless the King
your Father for approving and consenting thereunto, by his Royal Declaration,
which will make his Name famous, and his Fame immortallie glorious to all
posterity.

Yea it seems Heaven and Earth concur with us in this happy resolution, to
take down the Ambition and pride, and to curb the power and malice of
Spain. For the distaste of the French, the Defiance of the Hollanders, the
Jealousy of Savoy, and Venice, and the zeal and resolution of England, (now
demonstrated in her Representive body the Parliament, who cheerfullie proffer
their whole Estates and Lives, to so Just, so necessary, and so Honnorable
a War,) the Honor and safety of our own Estate; the Glory of GOD, and the
defense and protection of his afflicted Spouse the Church, does again and
again invyte your Highness Sword, and c^niure his Majesty's last and speedy
resolution to begin this War.

For it is not enough for the King your Father, your Highness, and the
Parliament, to give a form to your Military Consultations, except ye (cast
off all delays, remove all letts, obstacles and procrastinations, which may
retard or oppose it,) give a life to that form, and a resolution to that life
by drawing your Contemplation into Action, that our Ships and selves may be in
a readiness to prevent Spain, ere Spayn be ready to prevent us; and of power
to strike him, ere he can possibly be sufficiently powerful to threaten
us; and that our Regiments and Squadrons be enrolled, and in sight of their
Coullers, and ready to March at the very first call of the Drum, since
England, and Scotland, never saw fear but in the fronts and faces of our
Enemies, and always went to the Wars as to a Joyful Wedding, or to an
assured Victory and Triumph.

Great Prince, you saw and understood what a world of joyful Bonfires, (or
fires of Joy) we made, when your Highness returned from Spain, with as much
safety as you went forth with danger, yea our zeal and affection is so
ardent to your Highness, because your Obedyence is such to the King your
Father, that we shall justly hold our selves wronged of the Parliament, if
they (for themselves and the whole Kingdom) be not Peticioners to the King your
Father, that he will please to ordain, that we may Religiously keep and
observe two new Holidayes and Festivals, and that they may be henceforth
marked with Rubrickes in our Almanacks, to the end that not only our selves
but our Posterity may yearly celebrate and observe them, with a world of
Bonfires of Joy and joyful shouts and acclamations of rejoicing; viz. The 5th
of October, the day of your Highness arrival from Spain, and the 24th of
March following, the day that your Match with Spain was broken off, and Wars
declared for the restoring of the Count Pallatyne and his Heirs to their
Pallatynat and Electorat. That as we therein do now participate of the causes
of our Joy, so they hereafter may enjoy them by feeling and enjoying the
effects thereof; For, for the honor and safety of our King, and of all his
Royal Posterity, and for the flourishing prosperity and welfare of the
Church and Estate of the Israel of our Great Brittayne; he is not a true
Subject, a faithful and loyall-harted Britton, noe nor the son of an honnest
man, that is not ready and willing to bear his life on the point of his Sword,
and (if occasion present) to lose it, rather then to retain and preserve it in
so Just and Honnorable a quarrel.

And your Highness (for seconding and fortifying of this your Royal Fathers
Warlike resolutions, against his Majesty's, your own, and your Illustrious
Sisters Enemies, in the Two main points of our Welfare and Honor, (Englands
preservation, and the Pallatynats restitution) will accumilate and heap upp, a
whole world of Blessings and benedictions, on your Princely head from your
Fathers good Subjects; who with one Tongue, one heart, one affection, and one
soul, will (with as much Joy as zeal, and as much zeal as Duty) Pray unto
God for the long prosperous and victorious Life of the King your Father, (my
Gracious Souveraigne) of your Royal self, of our Gracious Princess your
Sister, of the Illustrious Prince her Husband, and their Royal posterity, The
which none shall perform with more true Zeal, and unfeigned Devotion, then

Your Highness, his most humbly Devoted Servant. S. R. N. I.

The Printer to the Reader.
GEntelmen, the Author his remote absence from the Press, has occasioned me
to commit many Errors, whereof he is innocent, his deserts crave and deserve
you to reform them, and I likewise desire it, as well for your satisfaction, as
for mine own excuse.

Farewell.
My Most Sacred Sovereign:
I Should not be that which God has made me to be, your Majesty's most
obedyent and most faithful Subject, if I were not a thousand times more
jealous and zealous for the preservation of your Majesty's, and your royal
Childrens welfare and honor then of mine own life; But since Grace has made
me so fortunat, and Nature so happy, as also composed me of a temper, that
I had rather die for speaking the truth, then live either to Conceal or
Desemble it to your Majesty; Therefore in the behalf of the forsaken Prince
Palatyne, your Son in Law, of his sorrowful Princess your only Daughter,
and their mournful posterity, for the loss of their neglected Patrimony the
Pallatinat, wherein my Conscience (guyded by the truth) informs my soul that
your Majesty's honor extremely suffers. Give me leave, O give me leave my
Most Gracious King (in all humility and Duty) to send these ensewing motives
and reasons, to your Majesty's serious pervsal and consideration, thereby to
incyte and stir up your Royal resolutions, for the refetching and
reconquering thereof, whereon at present the eyes of the whole Christian world
are constantly fixed. And thou great God of Heaven, who (at thie pleasure and
in thie providence) swayest the hearts and hands, the affections and actions of
all the Kings of the Earth thie Vicegerents; So bless my Sovereign and all
his senses in the reading thereof, that his Majesty's Judgment prevayle ore his
passion, his Courage out-braue his fear; that naked Truth may take place of
disguised Imposture, and royal Justice triumph ore hoodwincked and treacherous
Usurpation.

Although it be true, that the Prince Palatyne your Son in Law, committed a
first error of Estate, in assuming and taking on him the Crown of Bohemia;
will your Majesty therefore commit a second in permitting him to lose his
Pallatinat: or because he wanted no Ambition but Judgment to attempt that;
must your Matie. therefore want affection, zeal, and equity to him, to the
Princess your Daughter and their royal Issue, to tolerate and suffer this.
You likewise saw and suffered the Emperor to chastise him from Bohemia; and
therein you showed an act of Justice, which celebrates your fame to all Europe;
but if your Majesty permit him for ever to ruin him, and absolutely to
Deprive him of his and his Childrens Patrimony, that will be a Dishonorable
testimony of too great disrepect, and want of affection in your Majesty as
being their Father, and of too much fear and pusilanimitie as being a Great
and Potent King; and this will not only blemish but eclipse it to all the
world. Do I speak of Dishonnor, O then I beseech your Majesty to consider,
how long Honor is purchasing, how soon lost, and that having sacrificed all
the actions of our life to preserve it, we need but one Error to ruin it;
and as the meanest Gentelman is bound to this rule, so the greatest Princes
and Monarckes of the world, have (consequently) the greatest shares and
interrests in the prevention thereof. For the true Matchiavillians and
Emperickes of Estate, who term honor but smoke, are deceived and ignorant of
Honor; Since to defyne it aright, it is the purest gold of a Kings crown,
and the richest Diamond to embelish and adorn it; yea, it is a great part of
that which makes a King a King, because it gives him just reason to Command
his subjects, and they as just cause to obey him; and which is more, the
retaining thereof pure, and the preserving thereof immaculate, makes him to be
both feared and beloved of all his neighbor Princes, who otherwise will have
just cause to neglect and Contemn him, because he first contemned and
neglected it. So were your Matie. only a spectator, and not an Actor, or had
you noe Interest in the Pallatynat, you should then receive noe Dishonnor not
to attempt, or seek the restitution thereof. But since (for the good of your
Disinherited Children) you have as deep Interest in that famous Province, as
you have in the Royal blood which streams in their hearts and veins, will it
not be an honor for your Majesty to restore it to them, since it was lost with
shame, and a shame if you restore not them to it with honor: And in regard the
Emperor and Duke of Bavaria have conquered it from them by Usurpation, will it
not be an action as full of Compassion as glory, for the King of Great
Brittayne to reconquer it from them with Justice. And although peradventure,
the current of other men's affections and passions, transport your Majesty from
the true way of truth, in believing that the Dishonnor of this loss, falls
only on the Count Pallatyne, and no way reflects on your Royal and Sacred
person, yet the best of your subjects believe, though the woorst are so
treacherous to affirm the contrary, that the Honor of your three Crowns and
Kingdoms, do infinitely suffer in the loss of this one famous Province, because
it is the Inheritance of the Prince your Son in Law, the Dowry of his
Princess your Daughter, and the Patrimony of those Royal plants their
Children; In which consideration, is not the loss thereof as worthy of your
Compassion, as the reconquering is of your Courage. For if your Majesty who
is a potent and mighty Monarcke, permit this Illustrious (though poor) Prince
your Son in Law to be deprived of his Pallatynate, and Electorate (and
consequently ruyned in his reputation for ever) you have far more reason to
rest confident then incredulous; that the Austrian Princes excepted of the one
side, and those Princes to whom you are allied by blood or affinity of the
other, as you will assuredly make him the pity, so you will likewise
infalliblie make your self the laughture of all the rest of the Princes of
Christendom.

But how can the Prince Pallatyne hope of so great, and so just a felicity
that your Majesty will restore him to his Pallatynat, since you might have
done it with far facility and less charge, when Heidelberg the head, and
Manheym and Frankendale, the two eyes of that Province courageously held out,
and were yet in life and vigor; and that 5000. of your subjects then added to
these Valiant bands, which were already there under the Conduct of Noble Vere,
and Brave Boroughes, etc. would not only have prevented the ambitious
Designs, but also ruyned the covetous resolutions of the Emperor, and Duke of
Bavaria in the usurping thereof; which now 15000. can difficultlie effect. How
can he hope for it, when (under the cloak of consignation and sequestration)
he sees with fear that your Majesty has given away Frankendale to its
Deprivation; How can he hope of this courtesy from your Sword, when your
Majesty, and your Ambassadors, your tongue and your pen have actually
consented to dishonnor him, by dispoyling him of his Honnors: For as the
Emperor justly razed out his Title of King of Bohemia, so your Majesty
derogated from the affection of a Father, to ommit and exclude those of Count
Pallatyne and Elector, in all your Treaties, and negotiations with the
Emperor, the King of Spain, the Archdutchesse, and the rest of the Princes
Electors of Germany, unless your Majesty were desirous, that the said Count
Pallatyne your Son in Law, should be by his enemies degraded of his Honnors
and Dignities before his time, which untimely omission and connivency of your
Majesty, has in undervalewing him, extremely undervalewed your self, and
made the pride of the Emperor, and his Duke of Bavaria, fly a pitch both
beyond themselves and beyond Ambition. How can he hope for it, since your
Majesty now permits that the Dukes of Brunswicke, and Lunebourg, Count
Mansfield, the Lantgraue Maurice, with other Noblemen their adhaerents and
partisans, who have wedded his quarrel, should now be abandoned by your
Treaty, and held unworthie to be affected and protected by your Maties.
royal favor and assistance; that they who have so valiantly and
constantly defended his cause, (and in it the general good and peace of
Germany) should now by your Treaty of Suspension of Arms, be enforced to let
fall their swords out of their hands, and with them their lives, That they
who (partly out of affection to him, and partly out of your Majesty's own
procurement and solicitation to themselves) have prodigally spent their wealth
and blood for his sake and service; should now by him and your Majesty, be
abandoned as a prey, and sacrificed as Victymes to the implacable revenge of
the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria; an Act so odious and dishonnorable in the
sight of God and man, as neither your Majesty, nor the Prince Pallatyne your
Son in Law, can hear it proposed without extreme ingratitude, nor consent
thereto without infinite shame and eternal Dishonnor, both to your persons and
memories. How can he hope for it, when he understands that many of your
Courtiers (with less judgment then passion, and more Envy then truth and
Charity) do without controlement, term the Princes of Germany Traitors for
having assisted him, and yet what have they not hazarded for his affection, and
attempted for his service. How can he hope for it, when your Majesty
permitted the Emperor, and Duke of Bavaria, to violate in hostile manner the
Royal protection, wherein you took and received that which remained of the
Pallatynat, and when you had commanded your said Son in Law to Disarme, and
he and all his Army to desist and retire, that then contrary to your royal
promise to him, as also to your own expectation, you should permit his
Enemies to conclude and finish their Conquest of his Country; Which in effect
was to ruin him whom you promised to assist, A scarre and sicatrice, which
will infallibly remain apparent and notorious upon the face of your Majesty's
reign, except the remedy and resolution of your Sword redeem and deface it.
How can he hope for it, when as the common compassion of those who are least
Compassionate, are I wish I could as soon remedy as Pity your dejected
Estate; and that this of your Majesty toward him, comes far too short the
rules of vulgar Charity, much more the bonds and ties of Natural and Royal
affection, since your Majesty is so far from remedying his wrongs, as you
will not pity them, and which is worse, you can* but will neither pity, nor
remedy them. How can he hope for it, when you have permitted that all his
fortunes be only reduced to hope, and his fear to Despair. How can he hope
for it, when (since it is an injury as Publius Mimus reports, To laugh at
other men's Calamities and misfortunes) that so many of your Subjects, and
which is worse, of your Courtiers, lycentiouslie insult and triumph at his
overthrowes, and scoff at his afflictions, without considering that he is the
Husband of our Princess, and our Kings only Daughter, and his Children our
Royal plants, of the Stock and Blood royal of Great Brittayne, and without
receiving any punishment, or check from your Majesty, for the base enormitie
of this their foul ingratitude, and incivill Disrespect and Contempt, whom
you may easily discern, distinguish, and find out from your faithful and
loyal hearted Subjects, since there is as great Difference betwixt the last and
the first, as there is between true Protestants, and insolent and dangerous
Papists. And to conclude and shut up this point, How can he hope for it, when
you will not honnour or affect his Princess your Daughter, and their famous
and flourishing Posterity so much, as in these their immerited miseries, to
receive and harbor them into the Sanctuary of your Kingdom, It being the
last courtesy and consolation, which Nature tells me their Princely birth
deserves, and your royal Blood owes them.

And yet again, this neglected and dejected Prince your Son in Law, has
contrariwise much reason to hope, that your Majesty's Royal word and promise
engaged for the restoring of his Pallatynat, (added to the consideration of
your own Honor, which inviolablie ties you thereto) will in the end incyte and
stir you upp to Draw your sword, for the effecting and performance thereof;
For the words of Kings should be sacred, and their promises inviolable, the
Laws of Nature and Nations, tying them to the obligation of the first, those
of Grace and Heaven obliging them to the performance of the last. And if your
Majesty be pleased to forget, yet the representiue Body of England, the
Lords, Knights, and Burgesses of your High Court of Parliament, must and will
remember, that your Majesty protested unto them solemnlie; That (either by
Treaty or by the Sword) you would cause the Pallatynat to be restored, though
to the hazard of your own Kingdoms; Or if your memory (which in all other
actions is exquisit and excellent) should forget your promise in that point;
yet the Judgments and understandings of your Malesties subjects are more then
assured and confident, that your Royal pen affirmed it to your Printer, and
he to us in your Declaration, whereof look how many thousand Books there are
extant, so many witnesses (without exception) there will remain against your
Matie. that you only made that promise and protestation purposlie to break
it; For till they see the contrary, the most loyal and faithful of them will
never believe it, since your Majesty may perform it but will not, and since at
your pleasure you have the means, both to humble the pride, and to scourge the
power of the Emperor, and to make the Duke of Bavaria repent with blood and
tears, for his insatiable Ambition and Usurpation, in usurping and bereaving
the Pallatynate from your Children.

And because the affairs of the World (resembling the ebbing and flowing of
the Sea) are still subject to revolution and change, and only constant in
unconstancie, as also that (Euripides says) good is never separated from
Evil, and that it is impossible for us to avoyde misfortunes or adverse
accidents, because Plutarque tells us, that Prosperity is still transitory,
never Permanent. So I beseech your Majesty to confider, that if upon any
unexpected Accident, you should break, and have Wars either with France,
Spain, or the Netherlands, what a brave assistance of German Reistres, you
should still have at your Command from the Count Pallatyne your Son in Law,
of his Subjects and Friends, if he had again the Command of his Country,
and also how necessary those troops of Cavalrie would be for your Majesty's
service; either to make or divert, to begin or end a war. Whereof if Henry
the IIII. of France (of immortal same and memory) were still living, he
could give your Majesty a true president and instance thereof in himself, when
his affairs were so weak and desperate, as he was enforced to have recourse
to their assistance, the which Jews his Son now reigning, has very
unkindly denied, to acknowledge and requite to the Count Pallatyne your Son
in Law, now in the extremity of this his affairs and afflictions. And to
ascend from earthly regards to heavenly Considerations; If all these former
Motives cannot prevayle with your Majesty, to purchase and effect his desire,
yet lastly he hopes that you will draw your Sword to perform it, for that
Religions sake which is immediately derived from God, or for Gods sake, from
whom (as from the blessed and sacred Fountain of all Happiness) all true
Religion has its true birth, life, and propagation; and far the sooner he
hopes, that your Majesty will attempt it with Courage, and prosecute it with
resolution; Since God has made your Majesty the Defender of the Faith, and he
and all the Churches of his Pallatynat did, and then again will profess the
same Faith which you Defend, whereas now they are infected with the dregs of
Idolatrous Popery, and poluted and defiled with the mystes and fogges of
profane Superstition.

But Illustrious Prince Pallatyne; because it is a disputable question, whether
thy Courage or Misfortune be greater; therefore I grieve with sorrow and lament
with Grief to see all these fair hopes of thine, so untimelie wythered and
reduced to nothing, and thou have now tried to thie prejudice, and seen to
thine own Woeful and fatal experience, That hope which is built upon other
men's promises, and maintained by foreign power, proves most commonly ruynous.

And will not your Majesty then be sencible, of this fruitless and fatal
hopes of the Prince your Son in Law, which were wholly grounded upon the
sand of your promises, as yours are upon the snow of the Emperors and the
King of Spaynes. For to represent you Truth in her naked coullers, (and not in
an adulterated attire and tincture) and so to point at that point of the
Compass, from whence the contrary wyndes have blown your Majesty all these
several tempests of dishonnor, and your Son in Law these storms of
adversity; has it not been your too much connivencie in relying upon the
deceiptfull flatteries of the Emperor, and your too excessive confidence in
trusting to the temporising promises of the King of Spain which has
occasioned it; For by their Ambassadors and Letters, have they not depaynted
you the restitution of the Pallatynat so easy, as in assurance thereof, you
became passionatly resolute that you had far less reason to doubt then to
believe it. And yet to the whole world as well as to your own Subjects it
administreth more cause of admiration then belief, to think that your
Majesty who is the wisest, and learnedest, yea one of the most potent Kings
of the world, should thus be contented with Dross for Gold, with shame for
Honor, and fed with verbal promises in steed of real performances; For
your Majesty knows (and your Subjects are not ignorant) that Carlisle,
Bristoll, Belfast, and Weston, have spent infinite much, and yet gotten just
nothing from the Emperor, by their several legations; as also that that which
they spent abroad, and your Majesty at home, in Entertaynments, Feasts, and
Gifts, on the Emperors, the King of Spaynes, and the Archdutchesse
Ambassadors, would undoubtedlie have reconquered the Pallatynat, and what is
this, but their malicious and pernicious policy to drayne your Majesty's purse
dry, and to exhaust your Exchequer; thereby purposlie to clippe the wings of
your Courage, power, and resolution, from flying to the restoration of the
Pallatynat; Neither shall your Majesty have just cause to accept against me,
for here joining the King of Spain with the Emperor in the Detention thereof;
since their swords and forees aequallie Conquered it, or if not the King of
Spain (as the vulgar believe) for the Emperor, yet undoubtedlie the Emperor
and Duke of Bavaria (as the cleerest sighted know) for the King of Spayn;
because upon the whole the Emperor is more the King of Spaynes servant and
creature, then the Duke of Bavaria is the Emperors, and therefore that it is
rather more to be feared then doubted, that as he first took Aix and Weesell
for the Emperor, and ever since keeps them for himself; that right so he
intends to deal with the Pallatynat; and if your Majesty would but turn
your back to Spain, and your eyes to the Pallatynat, you will then confirm my
oppinion, whereas (with a fearful jelousie) I apprehend, that turning your
back to the Pallatynat, and your eyes to Spain, you may peradventure
passionatlie oppose and contradict it; For as the diseases and iniquity of our
times, and the Vanity of our Natures are such, as many times we see Ambition
gives a Law to Nature, and the strongest sword proves most commonly the best
right and tenure. So notwithstanding that the Emperor be puffed upp with joy
and pride for this his good success, yet the King of Said thinckes that the
Pallatynat is but a debt dew to his Virtue, and a tribute to his Ambition and
Greatness.

And that your Majesty may the more perfectly and apparantlie consider them
destinctlie or joyntlie, and so look from their tongues to their hearts, from
their words to their actions, and from the bark of their Friendship to the
tree of their Intents; Swartsenbourgh from the Emperor, brought only
Complements but noe deeds not hoapes of restitution of the Pallatynat; Bosquet
from the Archdutchess, (under the cloak of trust and consignation) carried
away Frankendale, the last hostage and pledge of that Province; and last of all
Mexia (with his stately Embassye) pretended from the said Princess, but
intended from the King of Spain, came to Comply with your Majesty, to make
fair weather of all sides, to keep every byrd in his neast and your Majesty
Sword still rusting in his scabberd; yea if the hearts of Inijoca, Mendoza, and
Columba, (whom I reverence and honor for the honor of their places.) were as
visible and transparent as Julius Drusus wished his house; Then
(notwithstanding all their veluett words and silken protestations and vows)
your Majesty should see without perspective or spectacles, that the most
retired Article, and secret mystery of their Kings Commission to them is; To
give their Infanta to our Illustrious and famous Prince Charles, but
infalliblie with this proviso and reservation, still to keep the Pallatynat
for the behoof and use of the King their Master; And what else do all these
several Ambassadors in England, and whereunto tend all their several
legations, but only to conceal the Ill which is, and to pretend the Good
which is not, in the designs and resolutions of the King their Master; For in
all their Treaties and Negotiations with your Majesty and your mynisters, what
do they else but purposlie play their prizes, in practicing their chiefest
invention, Art, and skill, to procrastinate the restitution of the Pallatynat,
making every day produce new Difficulties and Evasions, till in the end they
have made the Cure worse then the Disease, and which (without the help and
assistance of your Majesty's sword) will very shortly prove incurable, and
meerlie Physique after death; For the Emperor, the king of Spain, and the
Archdutchesse, do only feed your Majesty with the empty air of hoapes, and
with the bitter sweet sugar of many flattering and false promises, that they
will restore the Pallatynat to the Prince your Son in Law, whiles they in
the mean time (with as much treachery as silence) do heerbye only gain
time (in working and procuring their own ends) to repair and renew the
fortifications of that Country, till in the end they (like Molewarps) have
therein taken firm footing, and made those Cities and Castles which were easy
to subdue, become difficult, and the difficult impregnable; For the King of
Spain plays the Practicke with your Majesty, whiles you profess the Theorie
to him; you give him contemplation for action, he returns you action for
contemplation; for whiles you are entertayning and flattering your thoughts
with hoape, he and his Factor the Duke of Bavaria, has crowned his hoapes and
front with the Laurels of the Pallatynat, that dainty piece and rich and
bewtifull Province of Europe; neither is it your Majesty alone, but the French
King likewise, who has given too confident an ear to the Syreen tunes, and
charms of Spain; for whiles their practices and machynations threw him to a
pernicious and sacrilidgious War against his own Protestant subjects, then
Spayn recovered the Valtolyne, and deflowred the Fortes and passages of the
Grisons, and whiles he (by his Gondomar) lulled your Majesty asleep with the
melody of the Match, then he finished the Conquest of the Pallatynat. Only
your Majesty's dishonnor heerin is far greater then that of the French King;
because his remissness permitted but his Confederates to be ruyned, but your
Majesty, your Confederate your Son in Law, your only Daughter his wife,
and their Royal posterity. Thus as the Cyclope Polephemus devoured his
passengers one after another, so does the King of Spain ea^e upp whole
Countries and Provinces. And whereto tends all this formidable Ambition, power,
and greatness of his, but only to fill the sails of his glory; Whiles your
Matie. and other Potentates and Princes of Christendom most inconsideratlie (I
may say shamefullie) ride at Anchor in the Ports of false security, and
therefore of true danger; and whereunto tends all this, but in the end to aspire
to the whole Empire of the West, as your Majesty heard though would not
believe, from your last Assembly of Parliament, which our sins, and your
Enemies, caused you to make and entitle but a Convention.

All Europe can bear witness of your Majesty's two years pious,
interceeding, and Christian endeavors and resolution, to have the Palatynat
restored by Treaty, and although the Emperor has superficially promised and
the King of Spain artificially vowed it; yet still your Majesty sees
contrary effects, and still they fortify the Pallatynat, not for, but against
the Prince your Son in Law, as if they had given a Definitive sentence and
periode to their resolutions, and made it an Orthodox Article of their Faith,
still to keep and never to restore it to him, or his posterity; yea, the
Emperor is so glutted with his victories, and the Duke of Bavaria so
sursetted with his good fortunes (in both which the King of Spain insults with
joye, and triumph with exhileration) that they are now so far from thincking
of restitution, as they disdain it; Alexander the Great, (whose generositie
was yet far greater then his fame) showed such testimonies of his moderation
and Magnanimity, as he gave those whom he subdued and conquered, more cause
to rejoice then repyne at his Victories, yea he showed infinite Virtue and
Charity in his power, (and these twoe cannot be better shown then in giving
lymitts to power.) But it seems the Emperor is continually so inflamed with
choler, and transported with revenge toward the Count Pallatyne, your Son
in Law, as he is wholly unmindfull either of Charity or Virtue, he might
have added glory to his Victories and Reign, if his Ambition finding
prosperous success, could have been content with measure and moderation so
uecessarie in all Christians, and so requisite and relucent in Princes; But
what or why speak I of Charity or Moderation in the Emperor, when all the
world can testify with me, that his quarrel is so implacable, and his
malice and revenge so inexorable to the Prince Pallatyne your Son in Law,
and the Princes and Nobles of Germany his adhaerents, as he has given them
all just cause to fly to such remedies as despair gives to necessity, thereby
to seek to preserve their lives with their honnors, and their honnors with
their lives. And as hoape might but fear cannot be capable in them to
declyne their valor and courage; so had they not then reason to banish
hoape, when they apparantlie saw they could hoape for nothing but for Despair
in the mercylesse mercy of the Emperor. He leaves them still proscripts,
although it had been far more Noble for him (who holds the first, and
noblest Rank of Christendom) rather to have made them taste the fruytes of
his mercy, then to feel the effects of his Indignation; and is still so
erreconcilable and vindictiue, as if he has vowed to adopt, and make revenge
a Virtue, and resolved and sworn, that it shall be the last thing which shall
die with him.

Neither cann your Majesty justly conceive, that this inveterate malice of
the Emperor, and boundless Ambition of the King of Spain, is only bent and
intended against the Prince Pallatyne, your Son in Law; but likewise (by
virtue and reason of the same rule of Usurpation) against your royal self.
Since we cannot cut a finger, but we wound the Arm, nor cut offe an arm,
but we endanger the whole Body; And what does this Imperious swallowing down
of the Pallatynat by the Emperor, the perfidious usurping of the Cantons, of
the Grisons, and the eager threatening the total subversion of the Netherlands,
by the King of Spain, else portend and implye, but only to cut off the letts,
and obstacles, that with the more facility they may after make their
approaches to assail your own Kingdoms and Domynions; which treacherous
designs and resolutions of theirs, if your Majesty will not now believe, and
accordingly seek and endeavor to prevent; It is to be feared, yea I say
again, it is to be feared, that we yonr Subjects shall feel them hereafter,
when we shall have just cause left us to lament, but neither means, power,
nor time, to remedy and prevent it. For think what your Majesty will, and
say what you please, yet your best subjects, and not the woorst Wits and
Statesmen of your Kingdoms know, that when the Emperor and King of Spain,
beat Princely Frederick the Son, that at that very instant and act, they
undoubtedlie threatened Royal James the Father; and that (in the loss of the
Pallatynat) your Majesty upon the whole, is dangerously wounded and struck
at through his side, as well in the honor of your Sacred person, as in the
welfare and safety of your Estates and Kingdoms.

Give not cause O Great King, that the malice of the Prince your Son in Laws
Enemies prevayle above your pity and affection, nor their Usurpation above
your Justice, and although some Spanish Englishmen, and English Spaniards,
play the Mercury with you, to bring the Argus eyes of your judgment and power
asleep, seeming to have new Mynerva's enclosed in their brains, therbye to
inchant your senses and to cast your affection and Understanding into a
Lethargy; yet it will be a just and honnorable resolution for your Majesty,
that in regard the Emperor will afford noe favor to the Count Pallatyne your
Son, that therefore (according the sense and letter of the same rule) he
deserves to have none given or shown him by your Majesty his Father in Law;
and as your Royal heart is the Temple of Equity and Justice, so can there
any thing be more just and equitable, then to make the Usurper restore; yet
it is as necessary as just, for your Majesty to cause this restoration of the
Pallatynat; since to speak to the Emperor, or King of Spain, of the
restitution thereof, is but to speak to the wind, And it is to deceive your
Majesty's deep knowledge, and to betraye your solid judgment, to think that
ever it will be restored, except by your Sword. Noe, noe, it must be your
Sword, not your Tongue, not your Treaties, not your Letters, not your
Ambassadors which must refetch it, if ever your Majesty desire and intend to
have it refetched, For all other means are fledd, and have now abandoned and
forsaken you, and this of War is only left you to effect it, which will not
fail, nor cannot deceive you in the performance thereof; For otherwise like
Ptolomais in (Suydas) you may plead your self to death in expectation and
hoape thereof by Treaties, before you see it restored. And that the policy of
the Emperor, the King of Spain, and Duke of Bavaria, may in all respects
equalize their Ambition and Malice, in the resolute and constant Detention of
the Pallatynat; may it please your Majesty again and again to cast the eyes
of your Consideration, to see how closlie they have dealt with the Pope, to
fulminate and thunder out from his Vatican some false and irreligious
Aphorisms, therbye the better to over-vayle and the more authentically to
couller out, the monstrous Deformity of this their Usurpation therein; Whereof,
of his 29. I will at this present content my self to select and propose unto
your Majesty the three last.

1. 27. That it is not now in the power, either of the Emperor, or the King of
Spain, to replace Frederick and his Heirs in the Pallatynat and Electorat. 2.
28. That it is an unjust request of the Kings of England, and Denmark, and of
the Electors of Saxony, and Brandenbourg, to seek to revoke the Popes
Confirmation of the Duke of Bavaria in the Pallatynat and Electorat. 3. 29.
That the Pope cannot revoke the Confirmation of the Pallatynat and Electorat to
the Duke of Bavaria, without prejudice to the authority of the Sacred
Catholic Church.
Thus the Pope, or rather thus the King of Spain and the Emperor, who have
caused the Pope, falsely and maliciously to pronounce a sentence and Decree in
their own favor, against the Lawful right of the Count Pallatyne, you Son
in Law, and his Heirs; wherbye your Majesty may palpablie see, and plainly
observe, the letts and difficulties, yea the impossibility which your Majesty
may expect, for the restoring of the Pallatynat. And although I justly
confess my self (for Power, Learning, and Judgment) to be the very meanest
of all your Majesty's subjects; yet because I more triumph in my Fidelity to
you my sacred Souveraigne, and in my zeal to all your Royal Posterity, then
the Emperor does in his Imperial Crown, the King of Spain in his Indyes, or
the Duke of Bavaria in his new Conquest and usurpation of the Pallatynat; I
therefore most humbly beseech your Majesty to pervse and consider these three
Aphorisms, which I return to the Pope in answer of his.

1. That it is now in the Justice of the Emperor, and in the power of the
King of Spain, to replace the Count Pallatyne Frederick (and his Heirs) in
his Pallatynat and Electorat. 2. That it is a Just, Charitable, and Honnorable
resolution of the Kings of England, and Denmark, as also of the Electors of
Saxony, and Brandenbourg, either with their pens or swords, to seek to
annihilate and frustrate the Pope his Confirmation of the Pallatynat and
Electorat to the Duke of Bavaria, in favor of Frederick and his Heirs, and
that their Connivencie now therein toward the Pope, will infalliblie prove
Cruelty to themselves, and their own heirs for ever hereafter. 3. That the
Decrees of the Church and Consistory of Rome, are revokable, as having noe
affinity and resemblance with those of the Meades and Persians, and that the
Pope and his College of Cardynalls, can when they please revoke their
Confirmation of the Pallatynat and Electorat to the Duke of Bavaria, and
restore it to the true owner thereof Frederick Count Pallatyne, and his heirs,
without any new or farther prejudice to the authority of their Catholic
Church; Since if it were for the obtaining of their own ends, or the
propagation of their Romish Religion, as it is for our Protestant; not only
every age but almost every Popes reign, abounds with presydents of the same
nature; which those are infinitlie blind who see not, and extremely
partial, ignorant, or malicious who will not acknowledge.
And because (in my shallowe concceipt and capacity) it is pity that these
three Aphorisms of the Pope, should return without Interest; I therefore
adjoyne and send his Holliness these other three to my three forms, which in
all Humility and Duty I likewise prostrate to your Majesty's perusal and
consideration.

1. That the Princes Electors of Germany may make an Emperor, but that the
Pope cannot make an Elector, nor consequently unmake one, being made, because
it meerlie and properly belongs to a Civil power, and not to an
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. 2. That the transaction and Donation of the
Pallatynat and Electorat, made by the Pope from the Count Pallatyne your Son
in Law, to the Duke of Bavaria, does both subvert the fundamental Laws and
Dignity of the Empire, and also oppose and assault the prerogatives and
safety of Germany, and of all other Kings, Princes and Free Estates of
Christendom. 3. That the Connivencie of the Emperor, and Princes Electors, in
tollerating the Popes said transaction and Donation of the Pallatynat, as
aforesaid, opens a Door to the unjust intrusion of Rome, over the Liberty,
Souveraigntie, and indepencie of Germany, which henceforth will never be in
the power, either of the Emperor, or of the Princes Electors again to make
fast and shutt, if now they do not.
Having thus given six Aphorisms to the Pope for his three, I now again in
all humility and Duty embolden my self, to recommend to your Majesty's
Gracious perusal and consideration, three times three others, which I direct
and send joyntlie to the Emperor, and King of Spain, or rather against them
to your Majesty, and the whole world, thereby to unmaske their Ambition and
Usurpation, in the unjust detention of the Pallatynat, from the Illustrious
Prince your Son in Law.

1. That the Emperor invaded the Pallatynat by the Counsel and Instigation,
and Conquered it by the Arms and Threasure of the King of Spaynes, and without
it he could never have Conquered it; And it is clear and notorious to all the
world, that as the Emperor cannot subsist without the assistance of Spain,
that therefore in his Detayning of the Pallatynat; that the King of Spain, is
more your Son in Laws, and your Majesty's enemy, then the Emperor: for
take away the cause and the effect follows, as take away fuel and the flame
and fire will be soon extinguished. 2. That those who know the Court of
Rome, do apparantlie know and Confess, that without the close interceeding,
and secret solicitation of the King of Spaynes Ambassadors and Ministers, to
that effect in that Court; that neither the Emperor nor Pope, had dared either
to have taken the Pallatynat and Electorat, from the Count Pallatyne your Son
in Law; to whom by all the Laws of Heaven and Earth it appertains, nor to
have given them to the Duke of Bavaria, who has no other right nor claim
thereto, but only that which his excessive Ambition, and insatiable desire of
Usurpation suggests and gives him. 3. That it is in the power of the King of
Spain, to make the Emperor and the Duke of Bavaria restore the Pallatynat and
Electorat to the Count Pallatyne your Son in Law, and therefore that if they
restore it not, that then your Majesty may justly and truly conclude, it
lies not in his will. 4. That it is as easy for the Prince Pallatyne your
Son in Law, to be restored to his Pallatynat and Electorat by the help of
your Majesty's sword, as impossible for the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria to
keep it without the assistance of the King of Spain. 5. That as long as the
Pallatynat and Electorat is detayned and possessed by the Emperor and Duke of
Bavaria, so long (to common sense, and unprejudicate judgments) it is as
clear as the Sun, that their Law in the Detention thereof, is wholly and
solie derived, from the will and resolution of Spain, which is their Cynosura,
wherbye they steer all their actions, and their Delphos, from whence they
fetch all their Oracles and Instructions. 6. That it is a Castillian policy,
to make the Archdutchesse, a Negotiatrixe in and for all Treaties depending
betwixt your Majesty and the Emperor for the Pallatynat and Electorat, and
that she being a very old and sickly Princess, having as it were her Life
on her Lips, and her feet on the brincke of her Grave, That when she Dies
the said King, will then cause all her promises, Contracts, and assurances to
dye with her, and to be likewise buried in her Grave, which are or which may
be any way displeasing, or opposite to his ambitious Designs and
resolutions. 7. That if the King of Spain take not the real and actual
possession of the Pallatynat, during the life of the Duke of Bavaria; that he
will infalliblie do it immediately upon his Death; And in the interim, the
Cards are so cunningly shuffled between them, that upon the Whole, Bavaria
is but Spaynes Depositor, and the King of Spain, Bavaria's Patron and
protector. 8. That the restoring of the Pallatynat, which your Majesty makes a
matter of Estate, the quenchlesse revenge of the Emperor, and the boundless
Ambition of Spain, have caused the Pope to make it meerlie a matter of
Religion. 9. That your Majesty shall in the end find, that Spain, to have
the fuller pretext, and fayrer couller for his Ambition, in causing this injust
Detention and Usurpation of the Pallatynat; will for his last shift and
imposture, clappe the whole fault thereof on the Pope, by affirming he now
sees that it wholly derogates from the Honor and Office of Christ's Vicar, and
consequently from the Laws and Constitutions of the holy Catholic Church;
for Clement IX. to annihilate and revoke the Donation of the Pallatynat and
Electorat, to the Duke of Bavaria, which his Predecessor Gregory XV. gave him,
and that he being the Catholic King, he dares not transgress the
Commands, nor disobey the will and Decrees of the Pope, who is the head of
the Catholic Church, the Successor of Saint Peeter, and Christ's Vicar on
Earth.
These Aphorisms most sacred Souveraigne, are true, not feigned, and every
way worthy of your belief and Consideration; For your Majesty shall in the
end find, that the Emperor and the King of Spain, will not understand the
language of Restitution, because their Swords and Pens have ever practiced
and profess the Contrary. Yea, you have small cause and less reason to
apprehend or fear the Emperors power, who indeed is of very small or not
power, without that of Spain. And if Spain will still Countenance and
Command this his usurpation of the Pallatynat, then he is your Son in Laws
Enemy, as much, or more* as the Emperor, and so to be esteemed and held of
your Majesty, and noe osherwise. And for the rest of the Germane Princes who
side with the Emperor; you have noe cause to stand either in need or in fear
of their Forces and power, for although the honor of the Empire be frequent
in their tongues, yet their own Interest and ends, are more deeply rooted in
their hearts, and take upp the first place in their resolutions.

Your Majesty has a long time, yea too long time looked from the Prince
Pallatyne your Son in Law, in suffering him thus to be Dejected and
deprived of his Pallatynat; yea, and the whole world spare not to speak and
affirm this truth; that you are more desirous of rest then of Honor, in
permitting and tollerating it; He is a Prince fuller of hoapes then of
misfortunes, and his Valor and Virtues, make him more Worthy to be an
Emperor, then to be beaten by an Emperor. And all these crosses and losses
of his; are but the assaults of Fortune, the exercise of his patience, and the
trial of his generositie and Constancy. Your Majesty has seen him ruyned,
and yet it lies in your power and pleasure to repair those ruynes of his, and
to make him as happy as now he is miserable.

Look upon the Princess, his wife, and your only Daughter, and you shall
find that all her Husbands misfortunes and losses, do noe way blemish but
rather Illustrate her virtues, as if her fortitude and resolution, were to
Devyne to be outbraved by any earthly Crosses and afflictions. For the
remembrance of Reason and Honor, of her Blood and her Virtues, coming to
form it self in her understanding, makes her to entertayne different accydents
and afflictions with an aequall erected constancye, and although she have
only this Comfort and Consolation left her, that she is not the cause of her
Misfortune; yet those who fee her Beauty, and know her Virtues, do likewise
know, that she who is one of the Greatest Ladies of the world, should not
be reduced to this point of myserie and misfortune, to be one of the Poorest
and least of the world; Sir, God has made her your Daughter, and our
Princess, and adorned her with so many Virtues, as she rather deserves to
be Empress of the whole world, then Lady of a small Province; She
inheriteth the Name and Virtues, the Majesty and generositie of our Immortal
Queen Elizabeth, and is a Princess of such excellent hoapes and exquisite
perfections, that I cannot speak of her without praise, nor praise her without
admiration, since she can be immytated by none, nor parraleld by any but by
herself; And yet will your Majesty neglect her, and will you not draw your
Sword in her just Quarrel, whose Fame and Virtues has drawn most hearts to
adore, all to admyre her.

Look upon those Princely plants their Children, and your Majesty shall
find, that their looks and fronts do already in their Infancy, justly
threaten to revenge their Father his losses and indignities; and since they are
Descended from your Royal Blood and loins, will your Majesty suffer them to
be ruyned, as soon as borne, and that the Greatness of their Blood should
only serve to make their afflictions and misfortunes the greater; Harmless
and Innocent souls, what have they done to your Majesty, that you should
suffer them thus to be Disinherited, or rather what should not Nature prompt
you to do for them, again to restore them to their Patrimony and
Inheritance; For if you will affect them you must pity them, and you cannot
sufficiently pity them, except you remedy and revenge their wrongs, by
repayring the ruynes of their decayed and Shipwracked fortunes, in that of
their Fathers.

All the actions of Demetrius savoured of Royalty, and none will so much
royalize your Reign, and immortalize your Fame, as this of restoring your
Children to their Patrimony; your famous Predecessors and Progenitors of
either Kingdom, were too generous sencible and Delicate to digest or pack upp
the least affront or injury whatsoever, though from the greatest Princes and
Potentates of the world, much less so great a one as is this of the Loss of
your dearest Childrens Patrimony, from so weak a Prince as the Emperor,
(whose power gives the lie to his form, and comes far too short of his
Dignity and reputation) wherein the Honor of your Sacred person, and also of
all your Kingdoms and Estates, do most extremely (O that I might not say
shamefullie) suffer, for they made it both their practice and glory to strike
those first, who made but the least show or shaddowe, either to threaten them,
or to withholde that from them which they ought to restore; Yea, they have past
the Seas with royal Fleets and Armies, as well for Defending their
Confederates, as for keeping and reconquering of a poor City; And will not
your Majesty then take Arms, for the regayning and restoring of so rich a
Province as the Pallatynat, to the Prince your Son in Law, to the Princess
your Daughter, and to their Royal posterity, which is one of the goodlyest
Countries of Europe, and wherein there are so many strong Cities, and Castles.

And as the French (in Rome) give out against the Duke of Savoy, that the
delays which the Pope made in the judgment of the Marquisat of Salusses were
insupportable, that they had too long Disputed and pleaded for their own, and
that therefore it was high time (yea more then time) for them to decyde that
quarrel with the Cannon, in the playnes of Piedmont; So has your Majesty
just cause to say to the Emperor, the King of Spayn, and Duke of Bavaria, for
the restoring of the Pallatynat; yea let your Courage but animate your
Designs, and your Subjects will execute them; For, give them but the word of
Command to resetch it by War, and your Majesty will then see they will act
wonders with their Swords, not only answerable to your desires and
expectation, but beyond the Emperors, the King of Spaynes, and the Duke of
Bavaria's belief, and your Nobility and Gentry (out of their true zeal and
innate affection, to the famous Princess your Daughter, her Husband and
Posterity) will fly from Thames to Rhyne, as to a Fair, or Wedding, and you
shall have more Gentelmen in this action, then ever Germane Army beheld, or
Spanish confronted. And although money (which is the true cyment and synewes of
War) seem now scarce in your Kingdoms, and that your Bounties has made
your Exchequer, and Treasor empty; yet if your Majesty will be pleased to
secure but this one doubt and fear of your Subjects, that your Soldiers may
eat, and not your Courtiers devour the monyes which a Parliament will give
and raise you for this enterprise, you shall then assuredly find an Indyes in
your England, and more huge sommes of money cheerfully Contributed, then that
action can any way take upp or expend; you shall find that one Herald will
do more good then all your Ambassadors have performed. And as the
Mathematicians hold, that the rightest and straightest Line is still the
shortest; So your Majesty shall undoubtedlie find, that the rightest and
shortest way for you to recover the Pallatynat will be by your Sword. When
Scotland was not yet added by your Majesty to England, England (holding
herself bound in point of Honor) has sent a black Prince into Spain, a
Drake and Essex, into Portugal, and an Essex, Willoughbie, Norrice, and
Fourbisher into France, with stately Fleets and Regiments, to restore
Disinherited Kings to their Kingdoms, who were yet but our Confederates, and
will not your Majesty who has so happily United and Wedded Scotland to
England, and who is the powerfullest Monarch that ever swayed the British
Scepter, attempt and perform the like for the Prince Pallatyne your Son in
Law, and the Husband of your only Daughter our Princess; our hands, hearts,
and swords, being of as good, and of as excellent a temper as ever our
Predecessors were, having as it were hands of Steel, and hearts of Diamonds,
for the attempting and finishing of this Honnorable Enterprise; If the King of
Spain will not abandon his Cosen the Emperor, should your Majesty abandon,
or rather should you not assist and protect the Count Pallatyne your Son in
Law, against the Emperor. Or if there ensue hereon any breach betwixt your
Majesty and the King of Spayn; has he not given you just cause to undertake
that war, which is so Just, Honnorable, and Charitable, as to the eyes and
censures of the whole world, it bears its persuasion with it; And if your
actions and resolutions be such, that you resolve rather to give Spain cause
to fear you, then to take any to make your Majesty fear Spain, your
Majesty shall then infalliblie fetch security out of danger, and draw honor
out of shame; yea, if you will courageously resolve to cut this Gordion knot
with Alexander, and to pass this Rubicon with Caesar, you shall then truly
and tryumphantlie participate of the ones Fame, and of the others Glory; and
this indeed will make your Majesty live after Death, and reviue again in your
fame, as the Phaenix does out of her ashes. And noe sooner shall your Drums
beat, and your Coullers be displayed upon the banckes of Rhyne; but your
Majesty's sword shall put a new face upon Germany, and make England
(consequently) assume her old one, which was ever wont to look more
Martial, and less Effemynate, less contemptible to our Friends, and still
more terrible to our Enemies.

It is an action and resolution full of Religion, full of Equity, and full of
Glory, whereunto the honor of your Kingdoms, and your Royal person, and your
Majesty's natural affection toward your Princely Children, does both envite
and conjure you to attempt and perfect it; It is a work and labor infinitlie
worthy of your Sword, your Scepter, your Crown; yea, it will be one of the
most precious Jewels and Diamonds, which your life, can possibly give to the
adorning of your Reign or your Death, to the embellishing of your Tomb or
Chronicle; Is the recoverie of the Pallatynat a great action? Consider I
beseech you, that you are a Great King and a Potent Monarche; does it produce
difficulties? what important enterprise ever was, or can there be without
them, or what cannot the hearts and swords of Great Brittayne make easy, and
as success comes some times short of our hoapes, so many times it goes beyond
them; does it threaten Danger? why there is the more Glory to surmount it,
and being well and firmlie begun it will be already half ended; Since
there is nothing more Courageous then a good Cause, nor more Victorious then
the Truth.

And although your Majesty delight and glory to be termed, A Prince of
Peace; yet let your Peace live and flourish in Honor, and not wyther and dye
in Contempt and shame. For God, who is the Protector of Princes, will rather
releeve then ruin them, and rather desire and authorize their restoration to,
then their deprivation from their Countries, and it will be far easier to
believe then to represent, the joy which all the best and truest hearted of your
Subjects will conceive, when they shall see your Majesty's sword, as deeply
engaged in the quarrel of the Pallatynat, as your Scepter and Honor is in the
cause thereof; Our famous Elizabeth did beat Spain, and shall our Royal and
Potent King JAMES fear it; Besides, we see our trusty Neighbors and Friends
the Hollanders, rely upon the points of their Swords for the preservation
of their Estates and Lives; and therein they infalliblie find, the security of
the one, and the safety of the other, by Detecting and Detesting the
Treacheries of Spain, which is still more prevalent and powerful in their
calmes of Peace, then in their tempests of War, and it will be noe small
felicity to your Majesty, to see (these valiant and constant Confederates)
how courageously they will second your Warlike attempts in this restoration,
and how constantly and resolutelie they will marry their Forces to yours, and
with their best powers, pushe forth the Chariot of your triumphs against the
House of Austria.

Proceed Great King with this action so full of Glory and Honor, and the God
of Heaven and Earth make your Majesty still happy in your Peace, and
victorious in your Wars; And because it is a difficult point to satisfy our
selves and the time together; yet (notwithstanding) I hope that your Majesty
will pardon this boldness and affection of mine; except it be held a Crime to
honor my Kings Daughter, and to desire the prosperity and welfare of the
Prince her Husband, and their Royal posterity; which next unto that of your
own sacred Majesty, and then of the Illustrious Prince Charles your Son, I
will neither cease to do with my best zeal, nor fail to perform with my
most religious wishes and prayers.

From my Chamber, in your City of London, this New-yeares Eve, and I beseech
the Lord to give your Majesty many happy and joyful new Years and Days.
Anno Dom. 1624. Your Maties* most humble, and most faithful Subject till
Death. S. R. N. I.
