A comparyson between.iiij. birds / the Lark / the Nyghtyngale / ye Thrusshe
and the Cucko / for their singing who should be chauntoure of the quere.



How a sorrowful man went to the wood and there took comfort by ye melody and
comparyson of these birds.
FAme^tyng my sorrows with syghes deep
How lowryng fortune me had scorned
Pensive in my heart dreryly did weep
Whose scoff perfyt anon I learned
Rare is the wealth yt has not morned
Iocunde / plesaunt and of courage
O sorrowful hour in his outrage
As while markyng in cyrcle rotyng
Famous men calling to my remembrance
That rued pytyful in to dotyng
To mean men also showyng his varyaunce
Like the air than found I him of constance
Now smylyth fair and suddenly does rage
Mam rockyng in the flode of sharp passage
This did I secretly with me reason
Of him anon having aduertysment
To clyme not to hye for fere of euersyon
Above my state to make no interment
Of comparyson ospryngyth torment
Which of me patiently pondered
In me the matter lay / that he scorned
O low birth / why woldyst thou auaunce
When in thy purse lay al thy courage
In proudly port to make repastaunce
My wealth vanyshed in ready passage
Thus turned my state in to dotage
Fortune than why should I now accuse
Seeing he ragyth of my mys use
Proud nor portly be thou never
Comparyng / bosting nor of wylfulnese
To give reverence the endeuer
Recounter thy blood to be of mekenese
Of thy homage reason no secretnese
For when low blood clymith over hye
He tumblyth often hedlyng in vylonye
Let the cartar than handel his plough
The smyth his hammar dylygent entrete
Thy mind insatyat content with ynoug^
Peers like of blod together well met
Of nature prudently pondar thy fet
Seldom buddyte from the cartars gross breast
Polycy / cheualry and manners honest
This repetyng / in my mind often reuolued
Of presumptyon I did me repent
And that comparyson me not behooved
To late bewaylyng time mysspent
Sorrow to doble a folyshe intent
Therefore purposyng for my comfort
To a place of pleasure me to resort
I drew to the wood freysh enpareled
With flowrs smylyng plesauntly
With bewtyful colors enpurpuled
With sweet odor right sauory
A medycen apt for syke memory
And ny to a baythorne I approached
Entendyng to take rest there me choched
A busshe of pleasure perlese in the wood
Fragraunt / vernaunt / bewtyful in color
The blossoms iucunde / in virtue like good
Facyng the Lyly in whytly candoure
Al sweet flowrs disclosed their odor
The gods there to solace than I iugged
Such comely flowrs on every boufe budded
A fair founten was there at hand
A freyshe spring / clear as any Crystal
That sofely tryllyd on the sand
The which moysted the flowrs vernaunt all
The Lybanot and Lyly of conwall
With a pure sauoure that there remained
As Pallas / or Uenus there had bathed
The air murmured of their presence
As after assemble remaynith monument
Of great powrs in fet of magnyfycence
Which reuyued my mind with sorrow ny spent
Reioysed straight / unburdened of torment
And as fre minds pursuyth often sleep
So soft and gentyl on me did it crepe
But not long after as I ny slombered
Of tewnable cords I hard melody
Often recountering that my rest combered
A noise far passing in armony
In cords and raches of consony
Thet none I judge but would it desire
Except the ayshe unapt to the lyre
O my spyryttes so it refreyshed
My body trymbelyd in reioysyng
That ny my sorrow away it wayshed
And fully awake from my slombering
To it gave than dyligent heryng
My eye rollyd swyft here and there
To be fed as well as was the ere
Than gentyl touches I recorded
In wealth while fortune did favor
But to farmownt I remembered
A feigned melody lost in labor
Prove who list nothing like savor
For there is lernyng of reuenyence
But I learned here the notes of prudence
Mannys state was there descrybed
Among the fowls of the air
Man promptly there might have learned
Elegaunt to garnyshe nature fair
My sorrow where at did appayre
For comparysons I did combynde
Mekly assuagyng in their kind
Of fowls there certain did assymble
To prove their voices in counteryng
Arrogaunt began / but endyd humble
To sing most plesaunt was their stryuing
In sweet armony and also reasonyng
Betwyx the nyghtyngale and the thrusshe
The lark and the cocko in that busshe
Among them began a natural strife
Of melody who could best endyte
Their tewnes ware ready and outraunce ryfe
To tedyous ware it to resyte
Comparysons made in their delight
With reasons strong there lackyd none
That they renderyd one after one
The descryptyo^ of ye nyghtyngale.
The nyghtyngale made heuynly noise
Redobelyng her tewnes melodyously
Man beryed in sorrow it would rejoice
Sweet / plesaunt in consent / in cord ready
The ere fedyth no sownde more freyshly
That if al melody ware truly lost
To be found in her / perelese she might boste
Full meryly in time it recorded
Sweet / sweet / iug / iug right meruelus
And in another key straight reported
In manyfold notes like wonderus
To be taught in Paradyse / I iuged thus
Or had some lectorne of Melpomene
Which of armony has the dygnyte
But of the ere thus fed not suffysed
My eye I cast on that merry orgon
Of whose sight anon was amassed
So little a bird to muse that lesson
So audyble / so tewnable in good facyon
From the little body than I remembered
That famous virtue often has burgened
Hystoryes calling to my rembraunce
In the little body that virtue hydyth
The gross body a yocke to be of combraunce
Of educatyon / such robustnesse rysith
Demynishme^t of stature in virtue smilyth
Pregnaunt in wit / lusty in courage
In goodnese prompt / in counsel right sage
The sum of virtue there enharboryng
To al things apt that be of fame
The greattest conquest left in wrytting
To a little body that honor came
Before Alexandar who berith the name
Caesar in stature properd / fete and small
Whose polycy triumph had over all
Which Corylane morned in lost of victory
The gross body turning in occasyon
Also Sertorius him saved by polycy
The tail of the horse lesyng by reason
Sonar than strenght by good conclusyon
The batel of wit this prouyd spetyal
Where strenght and lymmes served not natural
Much feeble deceyt raignyth in strenghth
Hearts popyd in courage without aduysement
For lake of wisdom fowndering at lenght
And so most common we have it in experyment
In a little body lernyng has enclosement
Fresh subtyl and ready of outteraunce
Facunde / elegaunt and of remembrance
The seneuey sede who lystyth to behold
In virtue all other that does excel
Exhausten of nature gifts manyfolde
Powned the fragraunter I you tell
Busshyth in veruaunce though not mychel
So this little bird her notes endyted
Of no great foul so well there recorded
Of the Larkys melody
But not far of the Lark did appear
Composyng her pens arrogauntly
Which to that busshe approached sone nere
Fair penned ready proferyng to fly
Which as in worthy cheke for cheualry
Ny to that busshe straight took her flight
Mowntyng meruelus against the light
And ever as she did than assende
Like knight in camp for vyctory
Her notes she swetely did amend
Exalting her voice merely
The trebyl tewne song than freshly
The Nyghtyngale no bettar in report
Such sweet armony she made of comfort
I beheld that bird of strange nature
The clouds welny her enclosed
In the element redounded her voice pure
The heuyn to penetrat I supposed
The heuynly melody she dysclosed
At heuyn gates I judge she did get
The reches at pleasure that she did fet
Of orbs rotyng she learned armony
Enforsed by power of the first mouyng
Enstructed of nature lawde god almighty
The Egle thowghe strangly be in mowntyng
yet of it sure has not like outteryng
Recordyng at pleasure / deuydyng wonderus
Nothing so sweet Syrene the dangerus
Anon after she did descend
By little and little like a bird of price
With note that ever did amend
Ready in wings swyft / mowntyng at a tryce
Of the vernaunt lawre worthy in my aduyce
Which in the grotton anon lyghted
Faryng as she there would have rested
But quykly like a bird of bewte
To the fair haythorne took her flight
As after worthynesse showed of dewte
Would make clame there to some dew right
And among the blossoms did light
Like an heir to take possessyon
Clamyd of right for her swet lesson
Of the thrusshe
Which the thrusshe dylygent marked
That her ere fast laid to that melody
Like a bird greuyd anon carped
Expressyng sone her fast memory
As nothing had escaped of that armony
She whysteled and also chypped
And from bowghe to bowghe there trypped
Sone after that bird so semble and fair
Her chere changyd of greuyd cowntenaunce
To the highest branche leppyng of the bryar
And her gift of nature prowdly did avaunce
Showyng of muses her ready owtterance
Nothing was truly to her than strange
In cords at pleasure she did range
The nyghtyngale she did cownterfet
Like abyrde that would the hole reply
For no dysdayne she did than let
Full of courage syngyng right freshly
The larkys note she did descry
The starle / the keyt she pertly did mock
Robynredbrest the wren and the Pecocke
Such borrowed descaunt she song freshly
And of her own she spared no bost
Now sweet / now sharp and scornfully
Avaunsyng as the other had lost
Or none such to be in that same cost
And so on the bryar syttyng a hy
Proyned her fair feathers by and by
The melody of the Cocko.
Which father cocko sone espied
Full sagely restyng not far off
That to confownde him self emplyed
He noddyd with the head as a man would coff
Apperyng like one having no use thereof
And at the last it out did brast
A sad song and a formal blast
Great grauyte therein pretending
Tewnes syngyng of solempnyte
Plain was it witout ruffelyng
Crachettis nor quauerettis cured she
That esyly iuged it might be
By some subtyl reason would make clame
And not by note to encrese her name
Like as we read virtue has often spyred
From body not elegaunt of composyng
In members deforme or in tongue lypped
Esope was not al venust in shapyng
Demosthenes of nature was s^uttyng
yet reason pregnaunt in the one rayngned
Dylygence in the other eloquence procured
So plesau^t cowntenaunce often has be occasyo^
In vice or troble that some ware trapped
Much bewty shone in the face of Absolon
His bewtyful here in vice him lapped
Putyfers spouse fair Joseph clapped
In prison for his fair cowntenaunce
Because with her he made not dalyaunce
So rudy chekes have often dysseued
Crokyd lymmes be of lovely mekenese
Esyly gotten often times has grieved
Elabored thing is of more suernese
That lake bewty be of prompt redynese
To garnyshe nature with pregnaunt reason
In the cowcko prouyd by conclusyon
So from the cothows often has floryshed
Princes redoubded of valeaunt pusaunce
By virtue and vyctory that it purchased
Acts declaryng of worthy remembrance
Gydyng their people by noble governance
Which conquered to lands great royalte
Where vice spoiled them of auctoryte
So from the thorn buddyth the rose
In bowghe and branch not like apperyng
ye in savor his nature does lose
Rubycunde fair of plesaunt smylyng
White / sprynkeled of semble coloring
Like in the blake botel lyquor hydyth
Sweet / freysh / fragraunt that man confortyth
So this sorry bird in notes right plain
Not in pens arrogaunt composed
Of the lawre made profer to be feign
But that she note no bettar expressed
To reason she would styke I than iuged
In an oak not far of restyng
As would fle with her head noddyng
Straight from her perch she took her flight
Entendyng there to make comparyson
And in that bussh boldly did light
Where they chypped and chaunted a ceson
But not long after they began to reason
The chantors office who should have
So they compared them self to save
The reason of the nyghtyngale.
The nyghtyngale said she was worthy
In whom the key of musyke did rest
All hole her self feigned melody
Nothing delyueryng from her breast
But descaunt it was of the purest
Another bost than made of comparement
A sweet qualite to her only lent
When Lucyfers bemes be beryed bright
Than at rest sit you all lurkyng
Many sad hearts than make I light
The cord of true musyke reportyng
So Pheba I please with my chantyng
And yet on the day I seldom delay
Utteryng my notes with sport and play
The kocke refreysheth many a man
In the night from dull and duskyd slo^beryng
Prowdly crowyng now and than
But that ne pausyng suckeryth lamentyng
Of more lawde is worthy after reasonyng
Wherefore most apt am I for this office
A bird perelese of pryke and price
The subtyl set of good inuentyng
In cords and tewnes that plesaunt be
With coraged breast of clean delyueryng
Seeing the ground with reports of bewte
Bettar than his book is of auctoryte
Such cords be in me / such tewne is kept
As the lady of musyke in me had slepte
Another argument of right tytell
Most men of me take their repast
To feed their ere delectable well
Whereby to me such love have cast
Saying my tewnes that all have past
What nedyth me than to make reclame
Of that in possessyon that is my name
The larkys reason
Me semyth (quod the lark) ye do dote
Imprudently your self to avaunce
That will compare must have no blotte
I find in you a thing of combraunce
That sone assuage shall your dalyaunce
Like as the Pecoke in penues dysdaynyth
But foul legs his courage assuagyth
So does many one promote his parson
With crafty colors of advancement
All that furtheryng is good reason
The bow indyfferent is not bent
To touch the but lokyng for punishment
Of whom the proverb shall not dye
A man fawtlese / but / but does deny
Many commodytes ye do propone
Of notes / dytes and armony
By your self as ye ware perles alone
But to me it semyth a pange sorry
That lokyth on virtue and not folly
Them in a bundel wysdom does combynde
Which sone assuagyth the arrogaunt mind
your notes I beseech where do become
When Baron Ianus bloyth his blast
you lurk in a corner than very dome
your voice slomberyth / your pens do wast
That after your sight than no man has have
Is not this a bird like to make comparyso^?
In a pange of fortune whystelyng his lesson?
yet nere by nature may I approach
This office upon me to take
No sharp / hoar frost makyth me to choch
Nor feathers for it do asslake
But in the grotton mirth do make
And sometime for my pleasure merely
My armony sone will exalte an hye
With an other gift that surmowntyth all
Not earth only in me does delyt
But also the angels ethere al
Where I learn so puerly to endyte
And full well do I their grace requyte
In their sweet dew there bath I often
With plesaunt armony mowntyng a loft
I rendar kyndly that they me lent
Benefyttes geuyn in me do not spyl
My nowne person does it present
With prompt seruys and voice subtyl
Which is famous after my skyl
In an other freysh to behold plain
That with study dyscussyd his brain
This leftyd swetly in the air
Of armony only here not the lesson
But I contemplat the woddes fair
The flowrs / the odors have assentyon
Whereof I have great delectatyon
I behold well the place of amenyte
Paradyse in earth / most worthy of dygnyte
The reason of the thrushe.
Whom the thrush could no lengar forbere
Supposyng to speak al to late
As no laud had be left for here there
And for the office began to chat
Even in the bussh there as she sat
With formal reason of eloquence
As of Pallas had some influence
If in report there restyth praysyng
In the nyghtys melody co^mendatyon
In varyable notes much reioysyng
In contynual syngyng sweet consolatyon
Of armony to rendar the merry lesson
At heuyn gattes where freyshly it is
In solace bathyng of meruelus blys
In them cockyng virtue elegauntly
Allegyng for the lawre with dysdayne
Chockyng with a bone of dyshonesty
But one thing mark you very plain
Of parteys the hole does remain
And the hole is no other thing
But parteys compact in ioynyng
What thing partly ye have descrybed
In me of it the hole sum restyth
Who can endyte? of me not feigned
No foul in the air that ever fleyth
Of me herd but my breast reportyth
Seldom the bird vtteryth melody
That I report not in bettar armony
The mothe meryar it is said
Sen in diverse the bettar is sped
And of more worthynese vndenayd
Study in science sone is enhaunsed
If with quycke memory it be flowred
In incredyble memory science is lockyd
So in a dull head sone is it chockyd
Caesar is landed for fast memory
Of no man resyted / that ever red swyftar
Pennyng his mind in quycknes as ready
Of four quaterns he was compylar
Of epystels at ons no man bettar
Pycus de Myrandula not long agon
Thrughe fast memory fellow had non
Now mark ye dylygent my intent
The flower of study of me expressyd
To dylygent pregnaunce common is lent
if in no treachery the mind be duskyd
In slewth and dyscord be not there luskyd
Apt to honor is that elegaunt parson
Which as in me like / in none has perfectyon
This auaunsyd she in that natural house
Coyshe with her cowntenaunce vnderpopyng
Fair mayled and a properd small dows
With scornful sight rollyng on them lokyng
That bone i^ their throat thought to be choki^g
But sone after bespake her make
Her arrogaunt bost to aslake
The cocko.
Soth says the cocko it is that ye say
Sen in many but expert in very few
your breast vtteryth sport and play
With Meduseus as ye did renew
Or in the font of the horse lappyd the dwe
Much your comparyson greater your bostyng
As all the muses had in you reclosyng
To the hole perlese ye make reclame
A hole sum with a gross gappe
A false tytel and forged fame
A vain bost that the wind does flappe
A fair byldyng will stand parhappe
Insculped / enbosted and painted venustly
For lake of fundatyon fallyth quycly
So your reasons apperyng strong
Lykely / but false I can prove
What is descaunt with out playnsong
With reports of pleasure as ye love
In the mean or swetely to sing above
if the playnsong swerve from the book
A none your descaunt will stand a croke
To me it longyth to sing the plansong
And you on me to sing descaunt I wys
Now on mynom time and now two long
Together shall we sing swetely this
Most fyt for me than this office is
And seldom ye se it in experyence
But the quere rulyth the basys dylyence
After the which prudent and formal reason
To the cocko did they al assent
Geuyng him that office of promotyon
And each with other ware well content
K^yt in true love sone after ware bent
To repete their notes of melody
A sweet song to make of armony
The cocko began than redely to sing
A fair key taking of mean time
The dyapason now and than touching
The lark in her voice anon did clyme
The nyghtyngale reportyd him
A standing tenor song the thrussh
Joined in felysshyp in that bussh
Their voices in the wood did redownde
All instruments in pleasure excellyng
Far bettar their echo was in sownde
A fayrar lectorn they read of syngyng
Than did the hamors of Tubals techyng
Or Pyctagoras that was so tedyus
Knyt in a sum might se it compendyus
It was not frompelyd nor yet iombelyd
Nor feigned voices but of nature pure
Not hob for gyb out rayshly tumbelyd
Like blind bayar that nothing does cure
Little in the ground / in the book assure
Which not syngyth but scuyth al raysh
That with his frys^e from the cord does laysh
Than perseuyd I good apperyng simple
Of many coniectured folyshnese
In the wooddes to live forsook the cite
Renownsyng al pomp of wantonnese
Dwelled in the cothowse of wyldernese
And no merwel that such pleasure there found
Eloquentar dyte than in the tounde
So drew my sorrow to perfectyon
In my reason it did so well record
There restyth vehemence in a sweet lesson
With whom ragyng wyldnese ever will board
In greater dysdayne at the bettar word
Which delight in proverb shall not spyl
Much swettar is sport to the wanton will
The wooddes and the cite I did combynde
Many apply but few have the lote
In cord and dyte to agree of mind
Diverse study the armony of note
But in the dyte utterly they dote
As often is sen a man well enpareled
yet like goodnese within is fabeled
So in the cite armony is forsed
From the woodyes translate that melody
But bondage for lyberte is ill scorsed
Birds in chages be mured gayly
But that is coacte syngyth not freyshly
As in musytyons we se it plain
if it come not of courage they will feign
So cords of lyberte are in courage
With me contryuyng his nature
Uertu is lyberte vice is bondage
Which caused me to take more cure
Their dyte to mark / as note pure
And anon perseuyd it not dark
Against puaunt vice that did bark
The dyte to me was wonderful
Of the birds expressyd meruelus
No head but it would refreyshe dull
Man (quod they) learn this lesson of us
To sing in true love as we do thus
From the cord of love ospryngyth grace
Heuyn wynnyng / hydyng al trespace
Be content with the gift of nature
Upon the neyghbors enter not pryse
For presumptyon may not endure
Uyce of dysdayne does ever arise
Goddys creatyon do thou surmyse
All thing he created in true armony
Gift to accord here with gift meryly
After from thens they took their flight
Nature to sustain by his prouysion
Utterly vanyshyng from my sight
Than fell I in great medytatyon
Compassyng that sweet noise with my reason
As lightly it is in man most fervent
To record delight sometime present
O fortune ouerrollyd in darkenese
Ny mured slomberyng in my breast
Thy self forgettyng in welthynese
But sone a wry when he did wrest
Repentance had me welny oppressed
Learn learn man arrogaunce ever to fle
Condescend with these birds in humylyte
Man thy reason if thou do well till
Like swetenese of armony we find
In all men that refrain their will
As in brefe sentence I will combynde
The larkys note who bettar has in mind
Than where the flowr of chastyte smylyth
A heuynly tewne where so it restyth
That passyth this life in vyrgyuyte
With aungel equal and him beforne
Aungel in joy / man lapped in mysere
Trogyng and mournyng as ware forlorn
But syngyng this note fortunat is borne
Whose mind sone the clouds does penetrat
Meke and ready all wrong to tollerat
So the nyghtyngale euydent syngeth
In the gentyl breast of curtese
The fetes of reason there reports
A propred clame of that dygnyte
On pregnaunt wit grounded auctoryte
Laws to sancyt of ryghtfulnes
The ragyng mind to let of wyldnes
Whom of innocents I may call
The good and sure buckeler of defense
Chastenyng vice and will tyrannical
A note trewly of hye magnyficence
Both in night and day of ready presence
The night turnyth in daily pastaunce
Correctyth sin and virtue does enhaunce
In diverse tewnes of the thrushys musyng
In a gross sum together come
Clearly expressyth the common living
In the line of like merye that do rest
That holdyth of other is not the purest
Whose varyable notes do dysclose
The indygest life that most do repose
The dangerus recourse of marchandyse
The subtyl inuentyon artyfytyal
Composyng in ordar by semble wise
To confort our life with things materyal
With handy crafts that be like natural
Which in a nombre if we redress
The thurshys notes will express
Now the cocko druggyth at the plough
Plain as a pack estafe ever in care
Be it frost or snow he goyth through
if the plough speed the bettar do they fare
The Other geuyng the tewne of welfare
Than goyth the playnsong right swetly
The bettar musyke there of armony
But if the cocko the lark would feign
Dekey would sone their modulatyon
Or if the thrusshe the note would retain
Of the nyghtyngalys gentyl fatyon
Sone their cord would come to confusyon
As like to sight as an ape purpuled
Or a slave in a regal vesture palled
As plesaunt to the ere as the black sanctus
Of a sad sort upon a merry pyn
Lernyd in the bole of curtys Bacchus
Bathyd in musyke without / and within
Rage in cords / in dyte do deuyn
Querystars arrogaunt sit with dysdayne
For tha^ al wisdom ru^belyth in their brain
Like Sylene in swetnes of armony
Relyng from his dene with a black tankarde
Endyted verses of famous memory
The styffe oaks feigned him to regard
To Aglays promysyng wanton reward
Al faynyng to dance I judge they dremed
Or the earth with molles euerywhere heued
Like Promachus in triumph dysgysed
That lord of drynkars I may call
In Alexanders game vnsemble devised
Of three tankerdes he drunk up all
No man like him in quaftyng prodygall
He vsyd to sup them at a tryce
Wherefore among them he had the price
Like knight in field for vyctory
For the gottys wul that often stryuyth
Or for triumph being vylony
Of tyranny what laud ospryngyth
What to him that an other spoylyth
So of comparyson sorry is electyon
Where nether of them bryngyth but infectyo^
To strive in office it to auaunce
Famyd with the flower of humilyte
The virtue it is of noble constance
Not to bark at an others dygnyte
That garnyshe their gift right famous be
So drenched in pride often do lowre
Sit it in cothowse or in hye bower
The greater in wysdom / the hyar in grace
Goddys ordinance if they behold
In them pride shall occapy no place
The inflar mind may sone make cold
Common folowyth gifts manyfolde
Panges of folly daily pursuyng
In pride that the mind may have no raging
Holy saint Paul was often cuffyd
For all he was drenched in hye grace
With enflamed lechery often buffyd
Gladly calling to heuynly solace
To save him from that fylthy trespace
Which let al birds dylygent contemplat
So prydly venom shall not intoxycat
Let the lark than dylygent aduort
Which of nature in the grotton restyth
Heuyn to refreyshe by dew resort
With mowntyng plesauntly as she syngyth
Which thing a chaste mind well expressyth
No lowryng dark cloud may him let
His prayer before god to be set
The famous vyrgyn by prerogatyue
Tastyd grace slomberyng on Chrystys breast
The sacrament of secresy did contryue
In storys restyth ne such a conquest
Al power in ordar that has redrest
Recusyng honor / where honor might have
Highest in honor / that most men did save
Not entreprysyng iusted at the camp
Not shyned in vain glory and ryet
Their life is bryghter than any lamp
Treachery quenchyng by good diet
In highest tryumphe being most quiet
This offeryth incenses for our mortalyte
That often sagge redemyng our fraylte
Solinus showyth of a prouynce
Where the indwellars be hole chaste
Al toys of ryet that do deuynce
Their mind in virtue is lockyd fast
Not haltyng down from their norme cast
Like one time losyng / relyth to the close
Wrystyng and wryngyng to bring to purpose
The famous flower of nobylyte
The sweet reports if be lost
A bird in name but not in dygnyte
Which of hye lynage may make boste
But lackyng virtue / slepyth in the froste
Gentyl vngentyl that may be named
In the parent fair in the son dyffamed
Sone honor vadyth led by auaryce
Ever lackyng yet drouned in opulence
Sone mannys mind spousid to vice
Blinded / tumbelith in to neclygence
This garryth the note of reverence
Much truculence whereof ospringyth
That plain a dyscord no other syngyth
The vernaunt flower of gentylry
Bathyth in the well spryng of clemence
Justice / and the dew act of honesty
Preferryng / fauoryth royalte
Not grossyth / nor engratyth dayle
Nor druggyth with the cartar at the plough
But syngyth swetly content with enough
Crafts resyted artyfytyal
Their gift labored if they do apply
Most restyth in things materyal
To follow the lark behouyth truly
The Other to obey in cord meryly
So ioynyng fortunes by dyscretyon
The sweet cord shall sone rendar of reason
Now the lark pouerly ye ploughman ca^ play
The cocko unapt the other counterfyttys
Nature repugnyth the gentylman to play
As truly no game it is for slauys
To just in the field with silver sperys
So dew ordar makyth armony
A confused state garryth utterly
To pray belongith for our offense
The larkys note in humylite
The nyghtyngale protector of innocence
The thrusshe clothith our necessite
Of the cockoys playnsong al fed be
Which to confuse no other thing is
But the plough the oxen to draw I wys
Where these agree. O fortunat country
Irrored with the dew celestyal
Spousyd to virtue / endued with bownte
The sweet key reportyng armonycal
Rauyshed plesaunt in noise ethereal
Where though the muses be not present
yet their odor pausith in monument
Another like lesson than did I bownte
Which me refreyshed meruelusly
Many things creat I did recownte
Of the elementys nature facundly
In proportyons syngyng iocundly
In rarnesse / or thycknesse ever a t^^th
From their cord makng no ragement.
Dystyncted in strife by dew proportyon
Of whom compact is al thing sensyble
Whose armony spyreth propagatyon
And when they rage / yssueth mysere
Than ceasith the cord by feigned amyte
So wonderful in nature further in strife
Content with their virtue give to all life
So found I in countries descryptyon
Of al things in one not like opulence
Which inducyth this elegaunt reason
To agree in cord of lovely congruence
Therefore one has not the hole influence
That by co^modytes in need of fodar
We should aduertyse one to love an other
As of lands made of in mentyon
For gifts of nature that be auaunsyd
Some for subtyl and elegaunt inuentyon
Some for the vine famous be extollyd
Some for their savors greatly are co^medyd
Some wooddes / fell / catal and freyshe spryng
Some forest / dale and holsom fosteryng
Some hold much of the heuinly lark
An other of the nyghtyngale bost da^e
Diverse with the thrusshe daily do work
Most with the cocko druggen in care
Thus sour and swet in love joined are
But fortunat that park / plesaunt that tree
Where these be knet and in cord do agree
Which in the lectorne of cosmography
The gift of nature in none more opulent
Than in England of noble memory
Al these birds there sing right reverent
Seldom ragyng / or making interment
Fair semble and of lusty courage
Gouernyd by princes of hye lynage
A park vernaunt / plesauntly paled
Under fruitful plage by sytuatyon
With the surgyng see rownd a bowt mured
Fair in prospect / a place of miratyon
Dystyncted in prouynces by discretyon
Angels are like the people of cowntenaunce
For who^ there god makyth great purueaunce
Of catal and corn there is right good
From the hills the stremes do tryl
Encresyng softly at last in flode
Of forest and dale they have their will
Of fysshe and foul they have their fyl
Of metal there is a right good vain
Of men there lackyth no pour and main
Al lands to it have lyeng their trade
With all to change his gift is ready
Half stuffyd come thither / away go lade
God save England and keep in armony
The cord of goddis will to report daily
In true musyke their lesson to rendar
Their famous state shall last the lengar
Consent never drawyth to confutyon
The flower ever garnyshyth of prudence
A meke state never tumblyth in euersyon
A suffysed breast is full of clemence
That knowyth him self geuyth reverence
The sweet lectorne of the fowls assemblaunce
That where it spyryth is little combraunce
Whereof yssuyth a noble sentence
Man assuage thy insatyat appetyte
Of presumptyon alay the oftence
He lyuyth not here in cordly delight
Suaruyng from the tewne of his benefyte
Than let go pride and vnderproppyng
Look on thy self and leave thy choppyng
Let go bostyng and vain glory
The subtyl artyllary of the devil
Let go dyscorde a blastful sorry
Man of virtue that does ever pyll
And spouse thy self truly to goddys will
For will adulteryne may not endure
That louyth well god / he lyuyth sure
Created thou must the remember
In purpose of life far much bettar
Laud to god than se thou render
Freely he gave the a gift comlyar
To rendar again thou art but dettar
For such is ordained the meruelus sight
To behold the myrrour of tryforme light
Whereto to come god give us grace
The loving note to sing of humylyte
For that will mownt unto that place
Must nosel in no pang of mysere
Like will to like and ever shall be
That in cordly ordar live not here of life
Shall lament where is no ordar but al strife
Reason the norme of ordar has inuentyd
To tech man the path of heuynnys salace
That to publyshe Christ was incarnatyd
Growndyng obedyence to lead that trace
Love and ordar to purchese that place
Evil will and dysordar there to have no power
But faith and virtue to floryshe in that bower
That use well reason there shall have merit
That live for heuyn there shall have honor
Uertu there shynyth in perfyt delight
Of al swet flowrs there is the fragraunt odor
All perfectyon to behold that myrror
With other joys that be there in courage
Of whom I can not express the surplusage
From blyndnese of heart god us defend
To fyx our love in life perpetual
And not rest in thing that shall have end
For mortal in thing to delight mortal
As never would depart with love so spetyal
Hedlyng to tomble it is no other thing
To the dark lake of pytyful morning
God save our prince and his loving make
His birds to report in armony
From the breath god defend them of the lake
That the devil blastyth out spytefully
That this compyled Christ save from folly
God send us all the heuynly palace
Uyryng in bewte of meruelus solace
This endythth the comparyson of the birds compyled by dan Robert Saltwood
monk And imprynted by John^ Mychel.
