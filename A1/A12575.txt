Of the horrible and woeful Destruction of, Sodom and Gomorra.
To the Tune of the nine Muses.
THe Scripture plain does show and tell,
How Lot in Sodom Town did dwell
Amongst the Sodomites vile:
He did rebuke their noughty lives,
Both young and old, both men and wives,
Why do you your selves defile?
He often times with watery eyes,
their cause he did lament:
He wept in Heart, in grievous wise,
and bad them to repent,
Desiring: and praying,
From sin they should refrain,
Least Body, and Soul be,
In everlasting pain.
God does abhor that whorish Bed,
Which thonsands now therein are led,
and therein still does dwell:
They yield their souls for Sacrifice,
To filthy sin in diverse wise,
Unto the pains of Hell:
You rauenyng nee die men (quoth he)
That Riches have in stoare,
Give to the poor I say to thee,
The which coms to thy Door:
To Fatherless, and Wydowes too,
To pyttie them take pain,
You Surffetters: and Dronkardes now
From this your Sin refrain.
Then all in vain, Lot preached still.
They all did follow their self will,
For that was their desire:
For his counsel good they passed small,
In filthy sin they wallowed all,
As filthy Swyne in Mire:
Then did the Lord command that Lot,
That he should soon depart:
From amongst the Sodomites so whot,
For they should feel great smart:
The Angel then to him he said:
Come Lot and haste away:
For till the time that thou be gone,
Nothing be done there may.
The Angel said, look you not back,
To see that woeful sight and wrack,
Which on them now shall light:
For you out of the Town are brought,
And are escaped from their wicked thoughts,
Wherein they do delyght:
Yet Lots wife she turnde back again,
As soon as she was gone,
For her offense she turned was,
Into a huge Salt Stone.
Where she does stand continually.
By Gods decreed Judgment:
Because she brake, and did forsake,
Gods good Commandment.
The Gates of Heaven, God opened than,
So Fire and Brymstone from thence came,
And on Sodom down did rain:
Gomorra Town they did excel,
As thick as Hayle, the Fire it fell,
And destroyed was every man:
Both man and Beast were burnd to Mucke,
And Babes in Mothers lap:
And eke the Children that did suck
On Mothers tender Pap:
With Fire were they burned.
O woeful grievous sight,
They cried, and shryked.
To healpe no boot it might.
The Damselles tearetheir costly guyse
Their yelow locks down to their eyes,
And their Hear like Silver Wire:
Their sownde did reach unto the Clouds
With bitter tears they cried alowde,
All burning in the fire:
These Towns like Gold yt shyned so bright
With flaming fire is consumed:
The mighty God has destroyed quite,
And brought it to the ground:
That naught is left the Truth to say
But stinkynge Pooles and Wells:
Which was a place of brave delyghtes,
And eke of pleasant smelles.
Thus were these Towns brought to decay
Both all and some the troth to say,
saving Lots House hold then:
And Lot himself was counted tuff,
Till his Daughters tempted him to lust,
As the Story shows plain:
Lo, wanton Girls which so does burn,
In Venus pleasant games.
If that they may content their turns,
And eake their youthful flames,
They do desire their Fathers Bed,
The cankred flesh to please:
Alas that ye: so wanton be,
That you will never cease.
Thou mighty God that sit on hie,
O turn our Hearts for thy mercy,
That now amend we may:
O Lord thou saydst, and it may so be,
The Sodomits should witness be,
Against us at the latter day:
O heavy sayng, if that these men,
Shall sooner mercy crave,
Then we which know Gods sainges, then
What judgment shall we have?
O let us bewail us:
Our sins does so abound,
For in short space I fear the Lord,
In wrath will us confound.
O England thou like Sodom art,
In filthy sin does play thy part,
What sins are found in thee?
Thou dooest exceed Sodom in sin,
Thou carest not for Lots preaching:
O these heavy news will be,
Ye be thou sure, and sure again:
The stones that lies in wall,
Because we do so sore offend,
To God for plagues will call,
Therefore let see, amends to be,
And every one amend:
Good Lord I say, grant this all way,
And thus I make an end.
FINIS.
