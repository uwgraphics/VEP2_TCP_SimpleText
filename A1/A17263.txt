I Will crave pardon of zour excellence,
Incac^ zesuld esteem this for offense:
Into directing of this Treticie,
Not coresponding to Zour prudencie:
Quhois good ingyne, and pregnant spretit wit,
Crauts hier warks, with arguments mair grit:
Delyting ancient Histories to heir,
Else of events and stratagyms of weir:
Zour Hienes Zit, I hope, sall not refuse,
This Pamphilet, a litill to peruse:
Quhilk is composd and maid especially,
At sumtime, till expel malancolie:
And not composd, upon pretencis ill,
To foster folks, into their fleshly will:
This is not for to nurish turpitud,
Bot rather folks from sick things to seclud:
For torepeit this taill, quhat neid is me,
Se^ ^eill zour wis^dome can the matter we:
And promptly all the matter comprehend,
To quhat effect and sens the ^me dois tend:
Quhairin Zour honor plainly may persaue,
The good report, quhill honest lufers have:
The great reproach al^^^e may espy,
Of sick as in^^cencious lust dois (...)
With syndrie mathings (...) (...)aine,
To m^^^this wark, (...) (...) (...) and plain
Quhilk to the purpois, pertinent I fand,
And with the matter, weill aneuch may stand:
Craving may humbly of zour clemency,
For to remit this my audacitie:
Into presenting sick a wark profane,
Quhilk to the godly, will seem sumpart vane:
Bot I believe, na persoun sall present,
For to misconster, this my true intent.
And specially Zour Honor, quhome I crave,
May willingly, this wark for to resaue*
Quhilk to Zour potencie, I have propynd,
In sign and takin of my willing mind.
And for the lufe, I to Zour honor bure,
And not by ressoun of my litrature.
Presenting it, with heart precordiall,
Unto zour selcitude in special.
Quhois nobill persoun, will take in good pairt,
The true affection, of ane faithful hairt.
Into this Regioun rings zour great commend,
Because, that students dewly ze defend.
Menteining sick intill all touns and shiers,
As to the art of Poetry espiers.
Sen in zour persoun, sick gifts we persaue,

And sen ze are, the only son and hair,
Sprung from the synders, of that Phoenix rair.

Into this land, perpetually to leiue.
In serving God, and syne zour sovereign King,
Into this land, zour name lat lykwais ring.
Your Hienes may humble to be commandit. JOHN BVREL.

THE PREFACE.
IT come not only of my awin consait,
In Inglish tongue, this story to translait.
Nor zit it was my self that did deuyse,
For till attempt so peirt an enterpyse.
Lat him that bad me, beir the haill rebuke,
And me excuse, the enterprise that tuke.
Requeistit be ane Scollar as I say,
I was eschamed, his suit to dissobay.
Not for na lairning quhilk he saw in me,
Bot done expres, to prove my poetry:
Quhairin I grant, in colors and degreis,
Ar moan faults and great absurdities.
Howbeid so be my author hes na blame,
Bot it is I, that dois resaue the schame.
Yet have I done, the thing that lyis in me,
To keipe the color of his property.
I can not tell, how they the author call,
Quho of this buk, was first original.
Na dout, bot it hes been composd by Clarks,
Else recollectit out of OVIDS warks.
Moan their be that dois this mening move,
Because this laureat Poet, wryts of love.
Quha ever it be, that hes the author been,
He hes na schame, the wark may weil be seen.
Sumtyme it is als necessair as meit,
To have consaits to recreat the spreit.
The Poet heir implois his hail pretense,
To myrrie mowis, not tending to small sense,
Quhairin thou planely, may persaue and see,
As in ane specular before thine eye.
Quhat skaith acurs ill company to hant,
As GALATHEA dois confess and grant.
Cursing the day of her nativity,
That sche had hantit in sic company.
Namely of ANVS, quho did her bechok,
And brocht her blindlings, on this schameful blok.
As efterward intill effect sche fand,
Quhilk till all maids, may for example stand.
Sic peruers company, for till forbeir,
And to their* counsall not to len their eir.
Be PAMPHILVS, he likwais dois present,
The crukit course, and fleschly full intent.
And heir be VENUS, is demonstrat to,
The fleschlie course, quhilk nature bids us do.
Thairfore tak tent this matter to remeid,
The peth of lufe is parralus indeid.
And as the Poet in sum pairts dois say,
Lufe is both frost and snaw, in mids of May.
It is a thing men's sensis for to move,
To enter in the laborinth of love.
Thairfore bewar with sicklik things to mell,
Unless thairin ye intricat your sell.
The subtle schafts of CUPID ar may kene,
For be his counsall fail, hes blindit been.
Sum Poets pens of VENUS majesty,
And calls her medcin, of Malancolie.
At the first face thocht it be sweit but dout,
Into the end it bitterness brings out.
It is worse then, ane laborynth I think,
To fall in such a perrilous precinct.
I think it not convenient for the case,
For to deduce exampils in this place.
Sen I have them discriuid may copiuslie,
As into my adition ye sall sec.
Quhairin, I say men may them selfs resolve,
This lytill volume, gif they wald reuolue.
Quhairby I think the reder sall get gane,
And I sall not repent me of my pane.
Out of zour breists dame VENUS pangs expel
And se sche not insinuat her sell.
That is als mutch, as gif thou wald requier,
To tak fat oil for quenching of the fire.
Over great resort, sum time ingenders woe,
With VENUS court, quho chancis for to go.
For wantoun lukis, the messengers of love,
Temps moan men and maks their hearts to move.
Thocht femenin be fragrant and formose,
Sum Poets be compairs them to the rose.
Thocht it be rid, and fellun fair of hew,
Zit in the stalk, scharp pyks it hes anew.
Thocht they above be beutifull and fair,
Perhaps beneth their pyks may pik the fair.
That this is true, experience plain dois prove
Quhair men I mean lyis in licencius love.
To make remeid, and set thy mind at eis,
And for to suffocat their flams that fleis.
Conjoine thy self, in honest marage band,
Acording as the Lord hes geuin command.
Suspend your friendly censure in this case,
And lufinglie this lytill book embrace.
Seeing it is the first and formest fruits
Of my small gairding, full of widerit ruits.
The first crop of the ground, is not so good,
As the second quhilk ye may conclud.
Thairfore redarguat not my dull ingyne,
Sen with good will my cair I do inclyne.
This matter to make manifest to the,
Quhilk to thy eir delectabill sall be.
Not for na facond terms, quhilk thou sall find,
Nather before, nor in the pairt behynd.
I pride me mair, the truth for to repeit,
Nor into rethorik flours to flow and fleit.
Better with simplll wourds to keep the way,
Nor with trim terms, to er and go astray.
Althoch that I wald from my matter fly,
The warke in latin extant is to se.
Quhilk may correct me, quhen I make offense
Quhairfore I am compeld, to keep the sens.
And imitat my author line be line,
Quhilk maks my verse, so darkly for to schyne.
Perchance gif I had pend at liberty,
My verse had been mair elegant and hie.
Out of the way I have not gretlie swernid,
His method I so ^^w he have obseruid.
I haif omitit na thing be my brane,
Bot rather amplifiet the matter plane.
Esteem not that I of my self make ruce,
Bot in translation their is sum abuce.
Zit als subcinctlie, as I culd or micht,
The sentence I haif prosecute aricht.
And thocht my verse, be not poetical,
Nor sounding of the court rethoricall.
Nor thocht I be not of Precoxel spreit,
Nor into wit, over pregnant or pereit.
Bot as ane scoller laikand lair and skill,
I you beseik, to ponder my good will.
And luk not at my hands, quho this compils,
For cureous frasis, or for ornat stils.
Nor luk not, les thy self thou should abuse,
For polist terms, proceeding from my muse.
Unless that my prolixnes should you pane,
Into reciting, one thing over agane.
I will conclud and schortlie make an end,
Praying you not this warke to vilipend.
Gif virtue be extold, or rusid I say,
It flurish will, as flours in mids of May.
Quhair be the contrair, vertew wants exces,
It dois decay, and utterly decres.
Euin so gif thou this wark disdainful hauld,
In time to come my courage will wax cauld.
Bot thou esteming of my poesy,
Farther to write it may encourage me.
Quhilk unto the mair comfort sal redound,
And to the glore of God mair gretlie sound.
BE HONOR I LEVE.
PAMPHILVS SPEAKAND OF LVFE.
VVOundit I am and in my breist express,
Ane dart obscure lies lurken privily:
Nocht only lufe throuch my corpse dois acres
Bot dolor daily dois augment in me.
Quho schot the schaft and struck the straik truly,
The name na ways I dare expreme nor tell:
For lufe, I say, may never thole nor see,
The sight or contemplatioun of it sell.
Quhairthrow the perrells greter are I say,
Nor is the damage of my skaith indeid:
No help of health I think in any way.
May medecene give, my pains for to remeid.
Be what way than; can I cum any speid,
To pluck my self from yis cairfull consait,
Alas, quhat sall I do now into neid,
I may be countit in ane stackren stait.
I murne, I plene in anguisch and in baill,
And not but cause to cares I do incline,
Seeing no help of counsall can awaill,
Unto my persoun quhilk remains in pine.
Of money things sin I suffer reuine,
Of money things I had great mister to,
For often times craft with pleasour dois propine,
The awin master quhen he hes ado.
Bot gif my lufe discover and lat see,
And in effect the face make seen and bair,
Quhairfra it come and quhat it self mot be,
And quha the armor dewly did prepaire:
Perchance the self sic esperance micht spaire,
That it wald schortly make the awin remeid,
Hope, often times helps the Master into cair,
And often times it dois him desaiue indeid.
Or gif it cover the face in sic a sort,
Throuch dolor and feir, that it may not be kend,
Or gif that lufe, sal never seike support,
Of health, quhilk first that malady man mend:
Perchance war things, sall cum me til offend,
Nor were the former, quhilk molestit me,
So sall it cum to pass into the end,
Into displesour for to duine and die.
Better it is to let things cum to licht,
For fire unseen is vehement with reik,
Bot as for fire that is put into sicht,
Ye se it is mair moderate and meik:
And thairfoir now to VENUS will I speik,
Our life, our deid, and natural nourishment,
All things are led and gidit be her eik,
Sic is her counsal and government.
Pamphilus speaks to Venus.
GOd save you VENUS and your hail exces,
Our hope of health in quhome we do espier,
That causis all things that are more and less,
for to gif place and yield to thine impier:
The power of Captains quhen thou dois requier,
And michty monarchs seruis quhen thou commands
O godly VENUS spair Ithee desire,
My simple vowis and supplicant demandis.
Be thou nocht hard, O VENUS I besiek,
My humble prayers see thou not neglect,
Bot grant thou that quhilk I do suit and seike,
Seeing the matter is of small effect:
Small thing said I, for so I did suspect,
Bot to me caitife much thai ar as zit,
It is not hard to thee quha art elect,
To grant their thingis, thocht they were twice so grit.
Gif thou wald grant and let my speich cum speid,
I wald be blist, and turn away to rest,
Sua should all things weill prosper and succeid,
And turn to me in all things for the best:
Ane damisell neir hand me is adrest,
Quhome I mislike, that scho should heir remain,
Gif sche war absent, this I wald protest,
Sche wald releive me meikil of my pain.
Nar fire ay vsis for to do mair ill,
Nor fire quhairfra, folk may flee far abak,
Quhairfoir I seike your favor and good will,
For to releive and help me in this fact:
Sche is estemit mair frolic fair and frack,
Nor all her nichbours and her fallow feirs,
I am desaiuit, and lufe is far to lake,
Gif sche surmount not far above her peirs.
My inwert pains sche dois both perse and prick,
With dolent darts, quhilk in me dois abide,
Their dolent darts quhilk in my heart dois stick,
Na force of mine may them remove aside:
Quhairfoir al hours, ye every time and tide,
The dolorous wounds molests me money wais,
My color and my strencth from me dois slide,
My beauty als, decressis and decais.
This tale I keipit secreit and obscure,
Nocht schawing, quho maid first my woundis to beil,
Just cause there was the sooth I you assure,
Quhilk me forbad the matter to reueill.
She is esteemit of nobler race and quheill,
Nor I, quhairto I schortly condescend,
Whairfoir my secreitis now I will conseill,
Fering that sche my wourdis should vilie pend.
In geir and riches sche surpassis me,
Quhilk to be true richt weill I do consider,
For riches oftimes seikis as we may see
Honor and tocher both conioynit together:
Suppose my riches simple be and slider,
Yet honor and renoune with me remains,
Bot that quilk I may get or conqueis hider,
The same I get with diligence and pains.
Sen sche the dochter is as I suspect,
Of sum rich berger quhilk inhabits heir,
Amangis a thousand ane sche will elect,
Quhome best sche lufes and greatest lufe dois beir,
My trembling members in my flesch dois feir,
To see her form quilk puts me in ane fire,
Bot money causis evident and cleir,
Forbids me plain to tell of my desire.
Pride quhilk procedis of form and wavering wittis,
Prouokis proud hearts to follow forth that train,
For pride I say not suffers nor permittis:
In modesty ye maistres to remain:
I sailzit often from their flammis to refrain,
And from my heart with force them till haife dung,
Bot lufe me vrgit ay mair and mair again,
Quhen I begoud the same for to repung.
My misery ye may behold and se,
My dolor als is not to thee unkind,
Thairfoir I pray thee present for to be,
And on my prayer let thy lufe extend,
VENUS, to me na answer thou dois send,
Nor to my wourdis thou not inclines thine eir,
Thine crystal eyes on mine dois not descend,
Naither to me thy favor dois apeir.
Take out the arrows that so swiftly flies,
Out of my heart quhilk dois it break and bruise,
Or else my woundis ze metigat and meis,
Conform unto the fashioun quilk ye use,
Quha can sustain the care and great confuse,
Of so great labors and sic strange intents,
Quhat care is it that walde rewards refuse,
Unto the murning master that laments.
I schaw their things so that ye may perceive,
Quhat careful dolor all my courage clokes,
The grief and dolor quhilk I do conceive,
To ardent prayers daily me prouokes.
Now answers Venus to Pamphilus.
THan VENUS speikis unto this lufer boy,
Against great labor nothing can resist,
For any maid or less ye may enjoy,
With warke and labor gif ye like or list,
Eschame not then nor feir not till incist,
To schaw thy mind to quhome thou wald apply,
Scarce of a thousand ane I wald thou wist,
Sall give the na say with ane plain deny.
Sche quhome thou seikis with prayer till intrait,
Fra thy desire perchance will change her eir,
Bot not regard her carlage rouch consait,
Seeing the burding is bot light to beir,
The wicked byer on his back dois beir,
That sort of marchandrise to schange and sell,
Quhilk first the seller by ane aith did sweir,
Nocht for to haife as he the truth did tell.
To sail the Sea men wald not be content,
Gif that their hearts, for feir should faint and fail,
Quhair raging wauis and waters turbilent,
Gainestandis the schip, and dois the same assail:
Than gif thou see sche favors not thy tail,
Euin at the first vpoun ane suddentie,
Be bissie than, to win her favor hail,
With crafty art and great subtilitie.
Craft breks men's minds thocht they astray be boun,
And touns destrois thocht they be strange and wicht
Castles throw craft are stricken and dung down,
Likewais by craft, the burding is maid licht:
Fisches are taken by craft, and subtle slicht,
Beneith the fludis and waters that dois fleit,
Also by craft, men ryns both day and nicht,
Dry fute on Sea, but waknes or but weit.
Ye craft and office, with ane subtle tred,
Helpis money things, that wald return to wrack,
Pure men often times are nutrefeit and fed,
Vpoun the simple schift quhilk they may make:
Howbeit ane Prence despite and malice take,
By craft his spite to pleasour may appeir,
Ane guilty man by craft stands stout and fracke,
Preserving both his body and his geir.
The rich man now reioysis ye may se,
Quho wont before to sing dame Purtethis sang,
And now on horseback he is montit he,
Quha on his fute befoire was wont to gang:
Things that by Parents na wais did belang,
Bot be dame Fortune that may noble dame,
This craft and office hes giuin for ane fang,
Unto the exerciser of the sam.
Perchance gif that thou seis sche disobay,
To do your dewty quhilk with pains ye wan,
Zit not the les, see thou be ready ay,
To serve and please her so far as ye can:
Be this remeid, I think ye may and man,
Your lemens strife, and boste orecum the more,
And so ane lufer ye obtain sall than,
Quho to you did profes ane foe before.
Into those placis quhair sche hantis or bourdis,
Or hes may hanting so far as ye se,
Pretend ye their to feid them with fair wourdis
With merry mowis and sportis that pleasant be:
Youth heid lufes blithnes, and sweit melody,
With sporting wourdis best serving their behoof,
This drawis the hearts of young men halilie,
Fast for til enter in the snaris of lufe.
Schaw thou thy self, so sal thou not be deimd,
With visage blyth, quhilk will content her best,
For ay ane man the lustier is esteimd,
The mair with blythnes that he be possessed:
See thou be not over quiet or degest,
Naither thy tongue superfluously apply,
For damisels are ever mair adrest,
Thy countenance and gesture till espy.
Sweit modesty and pleasant talk procuris,
And lufe dois nutrifie as all men seis,
For pleasant talk not only hearts alluris,
Bot cruel minds dois metegat and meis:
Gif place be grantit than quhair ever it beis,
Proceid with courage both to skeip and loup,
Sche sall nocht only thee propine and pleis,
Bot gif thee that, of quhilk thou had na houp.
Shamefastnes not permits her till espire,
To seike that thing quhiilk sche wald fainest bie,
Bot that quhair of sche hes ane may disire.
That samin thing sche titest will deny.
Sche thinks it is mair honester say I,
Be force and strength her maidinhead to tine,
Nor for to say I plainly will apply,
Cum do your will and so the shame war mine.
Beware my counsel heir I will thee len,
Gif thou to little domiscill succeid,
Se thou conseale and na ways let her ken,
Thy poverty necessity or neid,
But diligence we see drives over indeid,
Ane honest life thocht their be little geir,
And can cloak over her tears in time of steid,
With cheirfull countenance for till appeir.
By thy behavior and thy wordis but dout,
Thou may esteem thy self for to be fine,
For hap and chance oftimes we se fall out,
Upon an small industry and ingine,
Men in the world have money things be line,
Quhilk to their nichbours not the same recordis,
Be this I say ye may consider sine,
How money to her qualities accordis.
Quhiles lesings helps as we may se our sell,
And be that mean sum makes their profit weill,
Hurtful it is sometime the truth to tell,
And in all things the verity to reueile,
Se that great gifts thou distribute and deal.
To seruand men and handmaids of her house.
Namely to sic as of her hes best feile,
And can persuade her with sweet words and dous.
Se so thou do for this cause and behoof,
That they of thee may make report at hame,
And feid thy lusty Lady and thy lufe,
With lusing praises to thy laud and fame:
Quhile sche excogitatis and weis the schame,
And hes the balance present in her hand,
Quhither sche mindis for til fulfill the same,
Or quhither sche the samin will gainstand.
Than bissie be to tire her with assais,
For so the bad, that blindit artchour boy,
Thou being victor, be their menis and wais,
In schorter space, thy lufe thou sal enjoy*
The mind of man, gets money tossed and toy,
Quhiles heir, quhiles their, bewrapit round about,
In pain, perplexity, and great anoy,
Ay quhile he leuis and lies into this dout.
Sum trinschman true, man in this matter mell,
Quho wald content you both, for little hier,
And in this matter, quietly culd tell,
Quhat war the thing, that both ye did desire:
Inuious age, ay subject until Ier,
The deids of young men, dois search out and seik,
And angry age, subject to flite and flyer,
Forbids young men, sic purposis to speik.
Begin, for time hes giuin, and sall gif yet,
Things, that by expectatioun sall appeir,
No lufe sall be, in that place, I promit,
Quhairin ye mister, for to dout or feir:
I say na mair, and thairfoir gif good eir,
Tak tent to win your lufe, that disobais,
The warke begun, sall schaw the self may cleir,
And sall proceid, ane thousand sindry wais.
Pamphilus speakis with himself.
ANe hail man makis small comfort to consaue,
In him that lies desesid, into distres,
Hereby, the Patient, na wais can persaue,
His malady, and sickness maid the les:
My dolorous tormentis, na wais dois decres,
By VENUS counsel, thocht her speich be plane,
Bot pains of lufe, my persoun dois poces,
Returning backward to my breist agane.
For ay before, my hope affixt was fast,
Into dame VENUS, thinking to get gane,
Fra me, my hope, and esperance, is past,
Bot dolor still within me dois remain:
My marinell hes left me frustrat waine,
In waters deipe, and fludis of all mischief,
Ane heuening place and port I seik with pain,
Yet can I find nane, for my schips relief.
Quhat sall I do? for feign I wald eschew,
My esperance, in her remains no more,
It me behouis, to gang again of new,
To speik with hit, with quhome I spack before.
Pamphilus seeing Galathea.
O God, gif sche cums with ane gudly grace,
With nakit hair, and countenence so mile,
This is ane may convenient proper place,
until us two, for to confer ane quhile:
I am in feir, as ane into exile,
In dolorous torments, heir for to be left,
And that my voice, and wourdis fall tine their style,
As ane, that of their sencis are bereft.
My force and strength, away from me is went,
I ttymbil and schaik both into handis and feit,
To me pure catif in astonisment,
Their is no part that proper is or meit:
I purposit often my tail for to repeit,
And of my mind till maid my stomak tume,
Bot feir and dreid hes so pocest my spreit,
To speik my pleasour I durst not presume.
Alterd I am with angueische grief and baill,
Sua that I skars can ken my self throw cair,
Houbeid ye se my voce dois faint and faill,
Yet not the les to speik I will not spair.
Pamphilus speikis to Galathea.
I haif ane nece, in kin to me richt neir,
Quho dwellis into ane town, not far abake,
Sche me requeistit to cum to you heir,
Ane thousand commendatiouns for to make:
Sche knawis you not, nor never with you spoke,
Bot be report of folkis quhome ye frequent,
To speik with you grit plesour s^he dois take,
Quhen time or place occasioun sall present.
My parentis maid me grit requeist them sell,
In my frendis town till haif remaind ane space,
Of the quhilk frendis, grit number dois induell,
And hes their habitatioun, in that place:
Their Parentis me contrackit in a case,
Vpoun ane maid, quhois tochergud was grit,
Schewes esteemd to be of nobill race,
Yet, I that marage never wald permit.
All kind of things, I plainly did postpone,
Sen ye haif plesit me best for my behoue,
I haife refusit for your sake alone,
All warldly thingis, awating on your lufe:
With smiling scheir, I speik their things forsooth,
For sporting speich* in youdeth ye may se,
Few wourdis, with bourdis, to blithnes hearts dois move,
Sua, be that menes, na stur or strife can be.
Gif, thou thy secreit deids, to me will grant,
And sua to the again, my sacreits tells,
I promeis, nane sall ^e participant,
Quhat we two speikis, except it be our sels:
O fragrant flour, in beauty that excels,
Lat promeis heir, be made betwix us plane,
Howbeid to speik, I have begun as else,
Yet not the les, I sall begin agane.
Sen we two minds, na langer for to strive,
The verity, we plainly should expreme,
In all this world, nane leuand is alive,
Quhome better I lufe, or mair of dois esteem:
First sen I lufit you, fervent and extreme,
Three years are past, the sooth I you assure,
Yet durst I never, sic things schaw or deem,
Bot was compellit, to keip the same obscure.
Ane wise man will, from conference refrain,
Gif his companioun deife, he do suspect,
Swa, it becums us not to speik in vain,
Except the matter turn to sum effect:
My fervent lufe, nane abil is to break,
For farther talk, I speik na mair you to,
Unto the time, your answer ye derect,
Quhat in this purpose, ye pretend to do.
Galathea, answers to Pamphilus.
SVm young men be, that all their cairs inclins,
For to deflore, pure damisels estaitis,
For crafty luse, and curious hie ingins,
Begiles pure lassis, with their licht consaitis:
I set not by your wiles, and wrang debaitis,
Your craft and art, I vilie pend in plain,
Quhome to begile, with flarry and defaitis,
It sall surpas your hie politic brain.
Seik siclike folks, as feirs for your estait,
And with your wickit plesours will comix,
And sic as with your fraudulent desait,
Will be begilit, with trumperie and triks.
Pamphilus speakis to Galathea.
Often times, the falts of wickit bissie bois,
Perturbis the just, and dois them back repel,
It is my nichbours faut, quhilk me anois,
And not the faut, quhilk I commit my sell:
O burd bening, whois beauty dois excel,
Of thy good grace, I thee beseik, til heir,
And grant me grace, a few wourds for to tell,
To you my maistres, and my darling deir.
I take to witness, God over every quhair,
With all the powers of this earthly sile,
Gif any thing to you, I do declair,
Quhilk spoken is, for fraudfulnes or gile:
In all this world, nane can I spy or pile,
Mair deir to me, or mair for my behoof,
My heart and mind seis nane, of na kin style,
Mair apt and wordie till auance in lufe.
It is in vain, the purpose quhilk I spak,
Be resoun of my barnlie age so short,
quhilk scarce yet kens, quhat damage it can make,
Or yet the profit, quhilk it may import:
Suppose young age, be scharper in a sort,
And prompter spreitit teddence for to try,
Quhen men of age, seis money things athort,
Young men I think, far mo things should espy.
Thocht thou be young, and barnely, I wald wis,
That thou should ken, and cairfully incist,
First quhat I am, sine, quhat my calling is,
And quhair my lufe and kindness dois concist:
Wisdom and craft, I wald thou kend and wist,
By use and custom, sall their secreits schaw,
All things be use, hes lernit been at list,
Quhilk mortal men, dois understand and know.
To gang and cum, and towartis you resort,
Our time about, for to confer anon,
With ernest mind, may humbly I exhort,
That we together may be both alone:
The inwart of the heart, is knawn to none,
Bot be the speich, it is cognossit and kend,
And thairfore now, I pray thee to propone,
Quhat is your will, and pleasour ye pretend.
Galathea, answers to Pamphilus.
YOu, nor na man, I sall forbid, I say,
To cum or gang, or yet his speich to spair,
Ilk traveler hes a richt gait and a way,
In sic parts quhair, it happins him to repair:
It is may decent, for a maiden fair,
Unto the askers answer, to reply,
A Damisell may do this meikill mair,
On any young man, till incall or cry,
For to confess the truth, I think no schame,
Of you, nor na man's cumming I take cure,
Providing, that my honor and good name,
From spot and blot, may be preseruit sure:
To heir and se, It settis I you assure,
And to make answer, quhen young men inquires,
This wald be done, with countenance demure,
And moderat manner, as the cause requires.
With mocking wourdis, gif ye impeche my eir,
Like speich again, to you I will present,
In any thing, gif I have hurt you heir,
To make ane mends* I sall be weill content:
To to alone, howheid, your will be bent,
That I refuse, and thairfoir speik na mair,
It is not decent, we two should frequent,
In any part, quhair na man makis repair.
In secreit parts, my conference to seik,
A sclanderous fame, sall rise from that effect,
Bot in the peoples presence gif I speik,
Ye know your self, I will be les suspect.
Pamphilus speakis to Galathea.
NOt small rewardis, on me thou dois employ,
Bot gifts may great, with favor I do feil,
Great gladness I consaiue, and inwart joy,
Your talking hes contentit me so weill:
To rander thankis, I scantly can haif skeill,
To you, quha did the benefits auance*
The constant talk, and wourds quhilk ye reueill,
I am vnabill for to recompance.
Perchance, the time sall schortly cum behind,
And I belief to see that happy day,
That for your favor, ye schall frendschip find,
And to my power, sall the fame repay:
I dar demand, or seik na thing, I say,
For feir I should provoke your wrath and ier,
Bot unto you, I man bow and obey,
Albeid, I yet have sum things to requier.
Thy l^^e and favor, I wald ken and know,
Gif kissis sweit, thou wald vouchsafe on me,
That we mair kindness, micht till other schaw,
Quhen time and place should offerit till us be.
Galathea answers to Pamphilus.
ALbeid, imbrasings nutrifies repas,
To wilful lufe, proceiding from despair,
By kissis sweit, oftimes it cums to pas,
That women are taken captifs in the snair:
To kis and clap, I will permit and spair,
Providing, that ye do na mair nor this,
Except your self, the suth I you declair,
My mouth, nane should get credit for to kis.
Now I belief, the Kirk be scaild amaist,
And that my father and mother be remouit,
Thairfoir I man pas to the house in haist,
That be my Parents, I be not reprouit:
The time sall cum thairfoir, be not commouit,
Quhen of our purpose, we sall speik in plain,
Let every one of us two weill belouit,
Have mind of other, will we meit again.
Pamphilus speakis to himself.
IN all this world, their is no persoun past,
Mair blithe nor I, or better at mine eis,
My hope and anchor is affixit fast,
Into the part quhilk may my mind did pleis:
The gods above, hes blessit my ha^^ decreis,
Dame nature als hes giuin me gifts in store,
I am maid rich in money great degreis,
Quha was may pure and miserable of before.
She did desire with clament wourdis and kind,
In my remember, to be satlet sure,
Na pane sal her, expel out of my mind,
So lang, as my remembrence may endure:
Her company, sche kens I do procure,
Yet skars sche kens, my fervent lufe so fre,
Into my former stait I sal demure,
Excep of me sche memorantif be.
I am releu'd, out of the troublus den,
Yet ma perplexiteis, dois me opres,
The quhilk occaseouns, makeis me to misken,
My counsal, quhilk should comfort my distres:
Gif I resort, or till her haif exces,
Sine sporting wourdis, with her do gest and gek,
The comoun sclander sall the same expres,
And make our speitch, to turn to na effect.
Excep be often frequenting I tak cure,
Our kindness to conferme, and make perfect,
Perchance our lufe, quhilk yet is not maid sure,
Betwix us both, sall sinder and acquit.
That lufe acressis, custom hes the wit,
Bot rair resort, makis kindness to decres,
For lufe, that is not cherisd with delight,
Ay waxis cauld, and daily growis the les.
Ingill, will be als bauld as ye desire,
Gif that with treis, ye bigit round about,
Bot fra ye tak, the timmer fra the fire,
From farther heit, it will extingueische out:
Now moan cairis, ganestandis my stomok stout,
Great perrellis als, my persoun dois preuene,
My mind is cast, in moan cairful dout,
Sic ar the troubillis, quhilk I do sustene.
Prosperity, agains me dois repel,
My fortoun als, from me dois slip and slyd,
My mind, hes na assurement in it sell,
Nor constant purpos, quhair upoun to bid:
Quhilis fortoun will gainstand, and set asid,
The deidis of men, that lukis for to find grace,
For sche permitis not, purpos til abid,
Into the awin rowme, or apointit place.
Albeid by fortoun sum hes hurt resaiued,
Yet hes sche helpit moan, intil neid,
Sua under fortoun, it may be persaiued,
How in this world, men present life dois leid:
God, and good travel furnishis indeid,
And us prouidis in all thingis sound and hail,
Without Godis help, na purpos can cum speid,
Nor in the world, na labor can awaill.
Let God be than my strenthe and fortreis stark,
And he quha should, my sacreit turns espy,
God mot be gouernator of my wark,
And to my interprisis all aply:
My brother nor my oye, thairfoir say I,
Sal not be tainschman, as they war beforne,
For few or nane, findis faithfulness thairby,
Howbeid, he be his natif brother borne.
Oye, until oye, howbeid they be bot few,
Can skars keip faith, quhilk by ane aith they sweir,
Brother to brother, will be found untrue,
Quhen flammis of lufe their courage makis to steir:
Throw small occasiouns skaith will quhylis apeir,
Bot wisemen will from siclik thingis apeill,
Thairfoir it me becummis, for to reteir,
Sum better way, quhilk makis mair for my weill.
Heir neir, by duellis ane carling aulde and teuche
Full of Ingine, and craft I you assure,
Sche is ane servant ape and meit anewche,
In VENUS craft, to exercise her cure:
Postponing cairs, quhilk present I endure,
To pas away my feit, I will prepair,
And to the auld wife, I will fordward fure,
My mind and counsel that I may declair.
Pamphilus speikis to Anus.
YOur laud and praise, in all partis dois apeir,
Ane good commend, of all men ye resaue,
Quhilk is the cause, that maid me to cum heir,
Your good consent, and counsall for to crave:
I will beseik, your good will to consaue,
My wourds, quhilk I am mindit to fulfill,
Let na man heir, quhat we two spokin have,
Without it be, with my consent and will,
My nichbour GALATHAE, that lusty maid,
Quhome weill ye ken, and with her often hes been,
Sche sais her self, her lufe is on me laid,
Gif so be nocht, I am begild I mean:
I am compeld, my tongue for to retene,
So feign from troubils, I wald fle abak,
I am in feir, sum perrill me preuene,
For I feir all thing, that may danger make.
Ane bruit will cum, but of ane little case,
Yet in men's mouthis lang time it will remain,
Howbeid, it lie and lurk ane little space,
Be often report, it will spreid out again:
Small thing prouokis, pure caitife men to pain,
A thousand ils fast fallows them with speid,
The wark and labor, quhilk hes vexit my brain,
Is yet in danger, gif it sall succeid.
Sen of my troublus stait, ye haise ane feil,
By your auice, the same may be adrest,
Beseiking you, to cover and consceill,
The falts and spots, quhairwith I am pocest.
Anus answers to Pamphilus.
ANe other lufis, that quhilk thou lufis thy sell,
And that thou seiks, ane other seiks thairtill,
Yet not the les, this meikill I the tell,
Into the matter, he wantis my gudwill:
The man is good anewch, I say na ill,
And seruis ane honest wife, I you assure,
Bot yet, the gift he offered to fulfill,
Did me displeis, because it was so pure.
He promisd me till exercise my schift
Auld clais, and clokis my mister till haife bet,
Bot sic a small propine and nochty gift,
Did make my dewty to be clean foryet:
Gif giftis be giuin in time, quhilk are to get,
It makis ane vantage, for to follow sine,
Richt law we see, peruertit is, and set,
Be budis and bribis, and be the awin ingine.
Nane will her get, the truth I you declair,
Bot be my moyen and gudwill, I mean,
For sche was my familiar ever mair,
And at my biding, sche hes ever been:
I am her gider, as it may be seen,
Quha kens her sacreitis both in good and ill,
Na thing unto her persoun, dois pertene,
That can be done by my awice and will.
I speik na mair, how ever the matter beis,
Sum other caris, dois all my body bind,
Let ilkane, gang their awin gait as they pleis,
To seik support, quhair they the same may find.
Pamphilus speakis to Anus.
HOw for till haif her, it may cum to pas,
My only cair, and exercise is bent,
Gif ye culd gar me, get this lusty las,
My mind with all thingis, ye wald weill content:
I think it neidfull and expedient,
To by the warke, wrocht be an vncow man,
So soon as he the samin sall present,
Conform to promeis, to reward him than.
Ye sall not be begild, nor set aside,
Bot for your pains, propines ye sall resaiue,
Gif be your moyen, ye may me provide,
Thingis quhilk I want, and wischis feign to have:
I pray you tell me that I may persaiue,
The name of that propine, quhilk ye procure,
Quhat ever it be, that of me ye can crave,
Thou sall it have, the futh I ye assure.
Anus answers to Pamphilus.
AL sick I say as bears dame Purtethis bell,
Seikis syndrie thingis, quhairof them selfis ar scant,
I am eschamd, for to declair or tell,
All kind of thingis, quhilk mister garis me want:
Quhen I was young, and in my simmer plant,
I was richt ratche, and in great substance set,
Bot now my geir, is al decayed, I grant,
Thairfore I mister money thingis to get.
My febill corpse quhilk daily dois decres,
And als my age, makis purtethe me persew,
The occupatioun, quhilk I do profes,
Na proffite makis to me, I wald ye knew:
In case ye se your kindness, I renew,
Or may make profit intill any way,
In times to cum, I pray you to be true,
And lat your house be patent to me ay.
Pamphilus speakis to Anus.
NOw both my house and all things sall be thine,
It sall stand patent, quhen ye cum thairtill,
The substance and the moyen quhilk is mine,
Sall be your awin, do with them as ye will:
Frendschip and concord, quhilk sall ay stand still,
Hes us conioynd, quhairof, I am richt feign,
The faith and promeis, quhilk I should fulfill,
Mot be maid sure, for ever to remain.
This ye man do, and thairfoir markit weill,
With walkrife cair, heir I will you protest,
This turn to do, with craftines and skeill,
And with discretioun, as ye can do best:
How things begins, out endis, and how they lest,
For to behold, it is ane wisemans will,
The end of all things schaws amangis the rest,
Quhat fruit cums forth, both intill good and ill.
Learn to begin, and how to end compleit,
Thy speich and talk, your purpose to decore,
That ye your wourdis, mair promptly may repeit,
Quhilk ye in mind, premeditate before.
Anus speiking that Galathea micht heir her.
INto this town their dwellis, as all men seis,
Ane trim young man, surpassing but compair,
Exceeding vthers, intill all degrees,
For good behavior, and for beauty fair:
Nane never was, mair sweit or debonair,
Intill our time, or age as I suspect,
My poverty, with help he dois repair,
Unto my purtethe, he hes sic respect.
All of his age, he far excellis in deids,
And in good manners, as it may be kend,
For PAMPHILVS surpassis and exceids,
His haill companiouns, into good commend:
To play the fule, with fules, he can pretend,
And gentries schaw, quhen gentillis him requiers,
Wise men fra daffing, can them felfs defend,
By richt and resoun, as the cause requiers.
In all this town, their is nane borne or bred,
Mair wise and honest, or in honor may,
His riches, quhilk he hes obteind by tred,
In wrang abuse, the same he will not waist:
He is both wise, and of ane good behaist,
For all his offspring, wise folkis wont to be,
Sweit fruit, neid force, man tak ane pleasant taist,
Quhilk dois proceid, out of ane pleasant tree.
The good effects, quhilk children will consaiue,
Into their naturis, plainly will appeir,
Often times, the soun pretendis him we persaiue,
His fathers futsteps, for to follow neir:
Behauld, I se fair GALATHEA heir,
Stand nar the port, not far fra me abak,
Unto my wourdis perchance, sche hes giuin eir,
And hard the wourdis and praises quhilk I spak.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
O GALATHEA, nane I believed to be,
So nar me heir, till harken at my hand,
Yet not the les, I haife not maid ane lie,
I spak the truth, as I occasioun fand:
Of PAMPHILVS, this far I understand,
All in this town, he far excellis, I mean,
Weill he forseis, how his estait may stand,
And how he may an honest life sustene.
His laud and praise, may planely be espyd,
It daily growis, as we may weill persaue,
With na man, he is hatit or inuyd,
By just occasioun hatrit to consaue:
Howbeid of riches, he abundance have,
Yet pride into his persoun hes na place,
For PAMPHILVS, surpassis all the laue,
Both for his riches, and his reverent grace.
Now GALATHEA, I will tell to the,
I wald he war your husband may derect,
Gif ye war wise, or culd your weill forse,
Ye wald desire, the same to take effect:
Howbeid my self, that marage wald erect,
Yet he himself, the same dois not consider,
Into my judgment, surely I suspect,
That ye and he, ane meit match war together.
Your kin, your clan, and clament naturis kind,
Together with your bewties quhilk I se,
Makis me consent, and think into my mind,
That ye war meit, together both to be:
We both drive over, and tins the time trewly,
With idill wourdis, quhilk we may be without,
Ane small occasioun, oftimes is the Kie,
That opins mirth, and makis the same spring out.
Ane ingill great, with mekill fire and low,
Will often proceid, bot of ane little spaill,
Ane small beginning, engenders and gars grow,
May waichtie matters, of a great auaill:
For to reuolfe in mind, I did not faill,
The inwart mening of their things prolix,
In time quhen we should had our purpos haill,
With wane consaitis the same we should not mix.
Gif in your mind, na motioun yet be wrocht,
Nor in your heart, to bring this blok till end,
Quhidder It pleis you, or it pleis you nocht,
Tell forth the truth, and speik quhat ye pretend:
And thairfoir tell, quhat purpos ye intend,
For na man sall, your sacreitis understand,
I either sall consceil, or make it kend,
As it sall pleis you, for to gif command.
Stur not for till expel, this schame profane,
Out of thy heart and mind, that it may be,
Only this schame, proceidis I make you plane,
Of rural use, and rusticalitie.
Galathea speikis to Anus.
RVdnes is not the cause, and circumstance,
Nor yet dast schame makis to stay indeid,
Bot in my mind, I marvel and I pance,
Quhairfra, your talk and speiking should proceid:
I muse quhat cause, hes enterd in your heid,
To cum to me* sic prasis to proclaim,
Or gif that he hes promisid you good deid,
To speik so largely, in his laud and fame.
Anus speikis to Galathea
THe faltis quhilk wikit men dois interprise,
Impedis the deids of just men this is sure,
Often times a man sustenes, and vnderlyis,
That pane the quhilk, his falt did not procure:
Albeid that I be indigent, and pure,
I seik not sic rewardis, my pains to pleis,
The present purtethe, quhilk I do endure,
Contentis my mind, and sets the same at eis.
Fra the beginning, sen this block hes been,
My mind consauid, how matters should apeir,
Their na man knawis, quhat talk, is us between,
The guilty man, is not beside to heir:
This is sufficient, thairfore tak na feir,
Gif ye war both, in wedlock bed at hame,
Then of this block, ye micht the burding beir,
Without reproach, ignominy, or schame.
Honest is he, and nobill their withal,
Into that samin stait, ye are aricht,
Your offspring and your first original,
Is kend to me, for I can count them richt:
His nichbours he excellis in beauty bricht,
And likwais ye excel above the laue,
Beauty with beauty, well agreis in sicht,
And pleasant to the parties to persaue,
In age and geir alike, God hes you blist,
Quhilk is ane cause, this matter to compleit,
In case the common brute, the samin wist,
They wald esteem the marage to be meit:
Sen ye are like in properties contreit,
With richt and law, ye may be joined together,
Betwixt you both, their na thing is forleit,
Bot only lufe, as we may weill consider.
Galathea answers to Anus.
COncerning the conditioun ye requier,
First to my friends, it should been tauld indeid,
By quhois consent and counsall I desire,
That this my marage fordwart should proceid:
Then speik thy self, this matter to remeid,
Or else, let PAMPHIL speik, their mind to heir,
Swa, sall the purpose cum the better speid.
And in the end, mair pleasant sall apeir.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
TO have your friends consent, it dois behoue,
Before ye enter into that estait,
Bot in the mean time, furious flams of lufe,
Burns up his breist, and haulds him at debait:
Ingenious lufe, steirs up ane new consait,
Into the hartis of young adolescentis,
Sic as delites to study in that rait,
May lessouns leir, concerning sic intentis.
This steirs up mindis, great gifts to dele and skair,
Bot greid and avarice, it dois plane displeis,
It fallow is mirth and blithnes ever mair,
Bot be the contrar, it from sadness fleis:
Na man can tell, pretend him as he pleis,
How mutch the use of VENUS dois them good,
Ecept thou condescend, to their decreis,
Thou sall be reput rusticall and rud.
Galathea answers to Anus.
ANe Damisell dois tine her honor clean,
In VENUS gamis, fra time sche schance to mel,
This ingent fury, and madness as I mean,
Can haif na rewl or resoun of it sell:
The violent wapins, of king Cupid fell,
Hes na licht burdene as your selfis may se,
And damisellis ay, dreids the truth to tell,
With their strange wapins, vinqueist for to be,
Brute quhiles, with accusatioun will inquire,
Ane Damisell, quho dois deserfe na wite,
Inuy and malice, eaten up in Ire,
Takis never rest all staitis for to bakbite:
Your awin petitioun, I should sone acquit,
War not the comoun sclander, quhilk I feir,
Quhilk sclander often procuris ane grit dispite,
And makis the parteis objectis till apeir.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
THe richtuous brute takis mekil force and strenth,
and the effects, may viuely dois display,
For verity, sall ay preuail at lenth,
Bot wrangous brute, sall peresch and decay:
The comoun sclander, I sall stenche and stay,
And all your cair, and feir I sall abstract,
Ye and your spots, sall clokit be I say,
Be craft and moyen, quhilk I sall you make.
Of VENUS use, I understand the cure,
Her craft I ken, and can the same define,
Swa, sall the matter be maid saif and sure,
Quhilk is deuisid and wrocht be my ingine:
Counsall me how, my wourdis I should incline,
To speik to PAMPHIL, quhen I se him sell,
That I may speik my wourdis the surer sine,
Quhilk ye before, informd me for to tell.
Galathea speakis to Anus.
IFeir to you, for to confess my case,
Or yet, my secreit counsel to declair,
For falset so abidis in every place,
That folkis are often taken captifis in the snair:
Yet sall I say, postponing all despair,
Thy faith and tongue, quhairwith thou do procure,
To quhat intent, thy crafty art and cair,
Mot me seduce, with fair wourdis till allure.
Often times I say, se thou him urge and pres,
With sic assalts, as he may not repel,
Perchance himself, to the sal say no les,
Nor I haif said, in presence of thy sell:
Pas hence thy way, and in this matter mell,
Discreit and warly, I will the beseik,
That on the morn, thou may declair and tell,
Sic wourds, as it sall schance him for to speik.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
Labor and hope, we may persaue indeid,
That money men often times it dois desaue,
Now PAMPHILE, the matter cums not speid,
Quhilk thou and I, both wischis fain to have:
Ye war over slaw, my counsall for to crave,
The time is tint, till make remeid to you,
Because the craft and cunning quhilk I have,
Can profit nathing to support you now,
As matters schaws, and plainly dois declair,
Fair GALATHIS marage is aprotchen neir,
I muse quhat clething can be makand their,
Hame in her house, agains that day to weir:
Ane hundredth causis evident and cleir,
Makis me suspect this matter to be sure,
Yet nocht the les, thocht all their things apeir,
Her Parents keipis it secreit and obscure.
Mark weill my wourdis, se thou them not foryet,
And way them wisely in thy mind I mean,
Seik never that, the quhilk thou may not get,
Bot seik thou that, the quhilk thou may obtene.
Pamphilus answers to Anus.
ALas, how faids my strenth and strange estait,
That wont beforn unto my corpse aply,
My body now is brocht to sic estait,
That mind and tongue, their service dois deny:
I catif man, lichtly regardit by,
Hes tint my strength, quhilk na man can restore,
Eitch of my members, as ye may espy,
Denies their duties, done to me before.
My hope hes hurt me, far by mine intent,
By hope, lufe to my bains hes stucken sure,
Hope is decaid, and far away is went,
Yet fiery flamis, with me dois still endure,
The sails quhairwith, my schip should fordwart fure,
Can find na port, quhairin to be reset,
Nor yet my ancor, quhilk should me assure,
Into the awin ground, can na entres get.
My cair is na wais certain, quhat to do,
Nor quhair to seik, the awin support or rest,
For GALATHEA is the only scho,
That may remeid, my cair and dolor best:
Sche is the cause, and wite, as ye may trest,
Of health and life, belanging unto me,
Quhome, gif I get not, plainly I protest,
Into displeasour, I will duyne and die.
Anus answers Pamphilus.
DAft PAMPHILE, quhat madness mouis thy heid?
Or quhat the mouis, so sore for to complene,
Thy murning teirs, can make the na remeid,
Nor na rewardis, thairby thou can obtene:
Lat modesty and wisdom the sustene,
And gyde thy teirs, but farther brute or din,
From farther teirs, I pray the purge thy ene,
And wisely way, quhat thou may do thairin.
Quhiles poverty espiers upon pretense,
Ane michtie spreit, to make the awin remeid,
For oftimes purteth, and great indigence,
Makis ane may cunning craftsman, into neid:
The cairfull craft of man, cums oftimes speid,
Orecumming perrils, tending to great tort,
Perschance your cair, and deligent craft indeid,
Into the matter, may you yet support.
Pamphilus speikis to Anus.
QVhat pain allas, now can orecum at last,
This michty perrill, of it self so grand,
My hope and esperance, perischis may fast,
Seeing her day of marage, is at hand:
Sche will not marry me, thocht I command,
So lang as her gudman, with life is led,
The crime is odious, as I understand,
For to polute or file the lawful bed.
The travel, quhairinto I did confide,
Is brocht to nocht, but any finell end,
My cair hes lost, the hail support and aid,
Of the awin cair, quhairon it did attend:
No nicht nor day, sall succor to me send,
Nor grant me rest, my health for to restore,
I catif man, am troublit to the end,
With lufe innane, quhilk me molestis may sore.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
Often times, great dolor cesis and grows les,
Intill ane schort time, as apeirs may plane,
Great blastis of wind, dois minisch and decres,
Be vertew of ane sobur schour of rane:
Ane fair day is excepit to remane,
After scharp schours, and blaistis that be so rud,
And health is als, exceptabill agane,
After sore sickness, and great egritude.
Ane wantoun curage, thou neidest now resaue,
All dolor and anger, far fra you mot bide,
Great mirth and joy, in mind thousall consaue,
Quhilk mot remove thy sadness all aside:
In GALATHAE, this mutch thou may confyd,
Thy haill desire, sche na wais will gainstand,
Sche hes giuin over hirselfe to me to gyd,
Sche is so subject unto my command.
Pamphilus answers to Anus.
ASlouing mothers, with great craft and skeill,
Makis false promits, with flatring wourds and fair
Admonising their children to be still,
And not to greit, nor for to murne na mair:
Perchance, the counterpane, ye wald prepair,
With feinit comfort, me to feid and feist,
That dolor micht remain with me na mair,
Bot should depart out of my cairfull breist.
Anus answers Pamphilus.
ANe silly foul, that hes escapit neir,
From the halkis clukis, that gredy is but grace,
This foul heirefter ay remainis in feir,
Dreding, that he should hant in every place,
Nocht hes me mouid, my tail for to disgrace,
To lie to you, in any kind of kew,
That quhilk I haif declaird into this case,
Sall ay be found, both upright, trest and true.
Pamphilus speakis to Anus.
GIf that ye tell, the verity to me,
And that sche likwais, sic things did confar,
The dolor quhilk I presently do dry,
Out of my mind sall be remouid rycht far:
Oftimes the end of matters, stikis a star,
And fallous not, the awin beginning frake,
Fortune I say, so kit till is and skar,
The wark begun, sche hynders and putis bake.
Anus answers to Pamphilus
NA mind of man, is abill to intent,
The fatal course of destaine to foreschaw,
It proper is to God omnipotent,
The future things, for till declair and schaw:
For to despair, great hurt, it dois ondraw,
Botident labor, gettis the haill desire,
Ane walkrife craft, with diligence ye know,
Prouidis mutch ritchis, with great wealth and hire.
Pamphilus speakis to Anus.
HOpe, under doutfull schance, dois fleit and flow,
Under the same, all thingis we do resaue,
Yet not the les, hope dois acres and grow,
Under ane good beginning, I persaue:
Can ye not ken, nor na cognoscens have,
Quhither that sche dois lufe me ill or weill,
Lufe, scarce can hide, or quietly behave,
The inwart heart, the quhilk it should conseill.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
QVhen unto her, of you report I make,
Her mind and will, I find to be discreit,
Unto my talk, sche dois atter dence tak,
In modrat manner, quhilk apeiris may sweit:
With tender wourds, sche dois me ay intreit,
And me embraces, round about the neck,
Requeisting me, for to tell and repeit,
Those wourdis, the quhilk ye till her did derect,
Quhen that occasioun, can it self present,
To nominat your name, in any sort,
Sche standis into ane great astonisment,
Quhen of the samyn, sche dois heir report:
And quhen of you, we chance to speik or sport,
Quhillis sche growis rid, quhilis pail, as sche were seik,
Quhen I keip silence, sche will me exort,
And me command, that I again should speik.
Be their conditiouns, I consider best,
And kens her lufe, how that it is menteind,
To me sche hes both grantit, and confessed,
That sche to you, is ane may faithful friend.
Pamphilus speikis to Anus.
MY hope and esperance, now persauis and seis,
By you, that my good fortoun did befall,
My hapines growis up, and fructifeis,
By your assistance, and suport withal:
May doutsum actis, that be both great and tall,
By labor great, ar stop and stayed we se,
Ane Idil craft, makis bot ane wantage small,
And bringis bot in, ane clane commodity.
Haist and auance, in so far as thou may,
The wark begun, quhilk yet in hasert stikis,
That na sueir tarry, thy turn stop or stay,
Quhilk may delay, or yet the same prolix.
Anus answers Pamphilus.
AS I believe, behauld before the strecht,
Your hail desire, quhilk is prepared I mean,
Bot yet the thing, quhilk ye unto me hecht,
Remains in dout, gif it I sall obtene:
Often times our myndis, ganestands, and contrairs clean,
That quhilk we speik, and plainly dois expres,
We fallow not our deids, as may be seen,
Conform unto the promeis we profes.
Falls promissis, begillis the gift and hyer,
Of work quhilk should be sauld, and changit sine,
Quhen ye grow ritche, and gettis your haill desire,
Perchance with na thing, ye will me propyne.
Pamphilus answers to Anus
TO ane rich man, it is ane falt may vile,
To trumpe ane pure man, of his gift and clame,
Gif of your salire, I should you begile,
To be vnhonnest, I should win ane name:
The wourdis quhilk I, out of my mouth did frame,
You nor na other, na time hes disauid,
Quhen that ye pleis, to speir my brute and fame,
Into the same, na spote sall be persauid.
My faith is constant, still for til endure,
And als my promeis, vpricht and senceir,
Quhilk faith anexis, and makis those thingis sure,
Quhilk to be vnperformd, ye dreid and feir.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
THe common pepill feirs, be the ingins,
Of michtie men, orecumid and taken to be,
The pure man's richt, oftimes fallis down and tins,
Throw small support, and wanting of supply:
Faith in all pairts, is spoild as ye se,
Of her fair hew, and color of pleasant price,
Quhilk covert is, with money craftis so sly,
All subject unto wickidnes and vice.
Na chance or fortoun, may gainstand or weir,
Agains the fatal destain from above,
Often times the Sea, puts money folkis in feir,
Yet not the les, na danger will them move:
I will commit, to fortunis awin behoue,
That gift the quhilk, ye did unto me grant,
Gif I haife promisd any gift, forsuth,
Yet not the les, the same, ye sall not want.
It me behouis, from hence for to reteir,
For till intise the las unto this fact,
Gif that it be her plesour to cum heir,
Ane quhile with you, for to confer and crak:
Gif that the pain and travel, quhilk I tak,
Assembill you together, se that than,
As time may serve, and ye may moyen make,
Luke that ye do the dewtie of a man.
The mindis of lufers, are ay out of rhyme,
And bydis unconstant presen till espier,
Ane schort hour, or occasioun at ane time,
May give the that, the quhilk thou dois desire.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
ANe michty fire, can not remove aside,
The licht, quhilk from the flamis dois gleme and sprout,
Nather can VENUS occultat or hide,
The awin desire, bot it behouis brek out:
The ordour of your matters round about,
To me are patent, as them selfs apeirs,
Of quhilk things, quhen in mind I think or dout,
I scarcely can contene my self from teirs.
I know perfitly, as it war perqueir,
That ye two lufis, not wisely nor derect,
The matters self, makis manifest and cleir,
The awin daft, and fulisch vain effect:
The visage pale, declairs as I collect,
The quiet lufe, quhairwith the heart is greuid,
Both hyd and hew, will alter and infect,
Without the same, with labor be releuid,
Pure PAMPHILVS remains may catif now,
In that estait, all hours abidis he so,
With ansers hard, his heart is persit throw,
That he molestit is, with grief and woe:
Both nicht and day, unwisely he dois go,
Wirken in wane, with labor all forlorn,
Hard manurid land, delivers not it fro,
Great store of seid, after the same be schorne.
Quha bot a mad man, of a wode degree,
Will seminat his seid, into the sand,
Wark vsis, mair acceptabill to be,
Quhilk bringis the gift, with the reward in hand:
Your beauty first desaiuid him, quhilk he fand,
And secondly, your tongue so smooth and ticht,
Stark lufe, hes woundit him, with Cupids brand,
To wit, your lufe bot, and your beauty bricht.
Your help on him, ye promisd to bestow,
Bot yet his malady, ye did not meis,
Quhairof, often times sensine, on him did flow,
The greter dolor, and the mair diseis:
His sickness wantis support, as all men seis,
And pain augmentis, without remorse or rufe,
Thocht ye your self, keip silence with great eis,
Yet are ye hurt, with fiery flamis of lufe.
Lufe quhilk is keipit secreit, and conceild,
Bringis dolent deith, and als ane deidly hort,
And lufe I mean, quhilk na wais is reueild,
To both your perfouns, perrill dois import:
Consider than, with mind delibrat schort,
Quhat is your will, your mind for to content,
That this your speich, quhilk to me ye report,
May be ane takin, of your haill intent.
Galathea answers to Anus.
OFtimes, dame VENUS, thristis my corpse may pure
With fiery wapins, quhilk are may seueir,
And sche with strenth, prouidis me ever sure,
Commanding me in lufe, to perseueir:
Bot be the contrair, schamfastnes and feir,
Bids me behaife me honestly and weill.
I being mouid, with their two things inteir,
Of my awin counsall, I can haife na feill.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
FAr from thy mind, lat all this feir be taken,
Their is na cause, of feir the till offend,
Considring, that their sall be never nane,
This matter to make manifest and kend:
Now PAMPHILVS, dois daily him pretend,
To be your husband, gif ye wald proceid,
His cair and labor, halily is tend,
How to perform this purpose intill speid.
A thousand wais, behavior schaws me more,
The ardent luse, quhilk in him dois acres,
Quhen he lamentis, with murning teirs may sore,
Their wourdis to me he plainly dois expres:
Sche is to me, both dolor and distres,
And als sche is remeder of my pain,
Only sche may, me wound I will confess,
And quhen sche pleis, sche may me pance again.
The pity, quhilk on PAMPHILVS I had,
Compeld my eis with teirs to be oprest,
Yet not the les, I was reioysd and glad,
Into my mind, with quietness and rest:
To se all things proceiding for the best,
And as I wischit, the matter for to strike,
I knew that ye, brunt both into wanrest,
With equal fire, inflaming you alike.
The flame ay vsis, hurtful for to be,
Thairfoir, forse your selfis, now hereintill,
Wald God, lufe wald commit you both to me,
Else at the leist, at my consent and will.
Galathea answers to Anus.
THat quhilk ye seik, I wisch with full intent,
For in the world, nocht deirer is to me,
Providing both, my Parents wald consent,
And to the samin, condescend and gre:
I dare not do their things, as ye may se,
Nor yet, they lie not in my hands alace,
Howbeid, we two, together wald agree,
Their is no part convenient for this case.
My mother, quho consauid me in her wame,
My keiper is, so mutch of me sche makis,
And likwais all our family at hame,
Both nicht and day, attendence on me takis.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
IN genious lufe, with sic a force dois cum,
It oppins ports, and clausters with a swak,
Swa ardent lufe, dois vinqueis and orecum,
All quhilk may hinder, or impeichment make:
Lat your vain feir, fra you be put abak,
And mend your barnly manners, may profane,
Sweit lufe exhortis you, iornie for to tak,
Hame to my house, with me for to remain.
Galathea speakis to Anus.
YE are maid privy, of my inwart heart,
And als my secreit thochts, ye do resaue,
Ye are the portioun, and the gretest part,
Of this my counsel, quhilk I do consaue:
I the exhort, and als of the I crave,
Thy faithful counsel, for to give so fre,
So that heirefter, thou na schame may have,
In giving consultatioun unto me.
Before the Lord, it is a grievous sin,
For to disaue pure virgins with defame,
For be thy counsel, thou may honor win,
And be the same, thou may resaue great schame.
Anus speakis to Galathea.
IShameles wife, sall cover and cast by,
The sclandrous brute, that hereon may ensew,
My doings sall auow, and not deny,
The counsall quhilk, I to you gave so true:
Gif any man wald to me have reskew,
Or yet agains me argument sustene,
Than lat him speik, and plainly me persew,
Gif in this matter, I have hurtful been.
And lat him cum, with all his haill ingine,
With all his force, to strive agains me strange,
That being win, he may keip silence sine,
Or else away with victory to gang:
Incontinent, good resoun us amang,
Mot make him sone, to me to condescend,
Swa, that be resoun, he mot speik na wrang,
Nor in my contrair, na wais to contend.
He is both good, and of great clan I say,
And very rich, as ye may heir report,
Sweit lufe I mean, and amity for ay,
Mot be ane part, of our help and support:
The fame mot be maid still for to be schort,
Together with ill brute, quhilk bringis a blame,
This matter hes, the awin way and resort,
Without respect of oprobrie or schame.
Galathea answers to Anus.
IN how faill parts, O God that sits abufe,
Are lufers mindis, transportit ever mair,
Quhilk mindis with feir and fiery flamis of lufe,
Both to and fro, are tostit heir and their:
Their diverse troubils, driuis me to despair,
And nicht and day, dois put me out of tone,
That thing, quhilk lufe likis best, with earnest cair,
That thing, vain feir, forbids for to be done.
It na wais waits, quhat it should titest do,
Into the wrang way, wavering far aghast,
It ers and wauers, and throw wavering to,
It nutrefies the wound of lufe at last:
Lufe me subdews, unto it self may fast,
Agains the same, albeid I strive and stray,
Lufe burns me up, with money biter blast,
The mair that I the samin disobay.
I vexit am, and with woe wereit eik,
With wark inane, quhilk dois my body greiue,
All wobegone, this meikill I will speik,
I rather die, nor in this stait to leiue:
Anus speakis to Galathea.
LIke as the greter fire will adres,
And be the motioun of it self arise,
And as the greter anger will acres,
VENUS gainstanding to their interprise:
Swa VENUS, hurtful till her awin asise,
With her awin weir, vprises to make tene,
And nurischis the woundis, after her gise,
Strife, being maid agains her self I mean.
Ye may not than, with weir as ye may se,
Extingueis or put out the flamis that fleis,
Your fire sall, the mutch mair meker be,
Conioynd with piece, the samin for to meis:
Obey dame VENUS, in her haill decreis,
Quhile as ye are her weriour keipit clos,
That all your strife and labor of waneis,
Redound not to your damage, skaith and los.
Daft woman, quhy do ye so rashly go,
To tine your life, all plesours til expel,
The hurtful error, ocupeis you so,
Destroying both your body, and your sell:
The visage of your friend ye spy and spell,
Howbeid, that he be absent out of place,
And he no les in mind, as I heir tell,
Both nicht and day, behaulds your fragrant face.
Ilk ane of you, till other makis a sing,
Setting your eis, ane in the vthers face,
Quhilk thing, sal deith, to both your persouns bring
Belang delay, prolonging time and space:
I trow ye travel lichtly, bot alace,
This cairfull matter, for to meis and mend,
Bot cruel deith, sall cum and cut this case,
And to your strife, sall schortly put ane end.
Into thy youth, tak up ane wantoun tred,
And all thy flechly pleasours, se thou feid,
Blythe hairtis, with blythenes aucht for to be fed,
For it becums, so for to do indeid:
Cum you allone, and play with me in speid,
Ane litill space, your spreit for to renew,
Hame in our house, ye sall haif meikill meid,
Quhair nutis, and apillis, ye sall get anewe.
My house was never empty, yet of meit,
Nor yet of fruit, for to gif folkis their fill,
Quhairof ye bauldly, may enjoy or eit,
At your awin plesour, apetite and will:
Quhat man is yon, that knokis so stoutly still,
And mouis our duris, with duntis, and callis so kene,
It was a man or ellis the wind so schill,
Bot I belief, that it sum man hes been.
Behauld it is a man, as I consaue,
Out at ane hole, he spyis us wondrous leil,
Now PAMPHILVS, it is as I persaue,
As be his visage, I ken wondrous weill:
The lock he opins, with great craft and skeill,
And piece and piece the same, with force dois prime,
Intill us heir, he quyetlie can steill,
I speik na mair, now at this present time.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
O Furious man, quhy ar ye bent and boun,
To brek the zettis, of their our houses heir,
With violence, our duris quhy brek ye down,
Quhilk with my money, I haif coft so deir:
Quhat wald ye, or quhois message do ye beir,
Or quhat comissioun, bring ye, speik it plane,
Gif ye haife any thing to speik or speir,
Speik haistily, and you return again.
Pamphilus heir imbracis Galathea.
O GALATHAE, above all things I say,
Thou art my health, quhilk to me dois belang,
Gif me ane thousand kisses, I the pray,
Sen for thy lufe, I lukit haife so lang:
My ardent lufe, sall not decay nor gang,
Throuch kisses, that betwixt us two hes been,
B^ sall grow, the starker and mair strange,
Be pleasant plais, and merry mowis, I mean.
Behold I do embrace, with stomach stout,
My haill delight, and plesour may compleit,
And als I do complex, the corpse about,
Of my true lufe, to me may deir and sweit:
Ane happy chance, maid me with you to meit,
Good fortoun als, my footsteps did adres,
For quhy, this place, conteinis the thing contreit,
Quhilk I lufe best, over all things mair or les,
Anus speakis to Galathea.
MY nichbour me incallis, as you may heir,
I will her speik, and sine return richt snell,
For grittumlie forsooth, I dreid and feir,
That to my house, sche sall cum in her sell:
I do draw neir, quhat gars you cry so fell,
I steik the dures, that I may fordwart fure,
Nane heir remains, the truth to you I tell,
Except the house it self, I you assure.
The turns me stops, quhilk I am subject to,
Tell quhat ye wald, thocht it be richt or wrang,
Sic bissines and turns, I haife ado,
Far gait with you, indeid I may not gang.
Pamphilus speakis to Galathea.
BEhold how lufe so hiely dois exceid,
Young pleasant plant, may prudent and perfect,
Constraining us to foster, and to feid,
Our hairtis with sportis, and plais of great delight,
Behold how wantoun VENUS, hes the wit,
Compelling us, her plesours till espier,
And us commandis, to tak our apetite,
Into that thing, quhilk lufers dois desire.
Quhy stay I now, and thairfore to be schort,
My humble suit, gif good atendence to,
And I may earnestly, will you exhort,
To tak in patience, that quhilk I will do.
Pamphilus warsling with Galathea, Galathea spoke their wourdis.
NOw PAMPHILE, hald up your handis with speid,
In vane ye both, molest your self and me,
For quhy, this labor, dow na thing indeid,
That quhilk thou seikis, can na wayis grantit be:
Hald up your handis, or we will disagre,
Your Leman ye comoue, to wrath and ier,
The auld wife will return, I tell to the,
Thairfore halde up thy handis, I thee desire.
Allace how little force, now sall ye find,
In wemenkind, quhois banis ar no wayis wicht,
Behauld how lichtlie, ye do knit and bynd,
My silly handis, quhilk hes na strenth nor micht:
Quhy trumpe ye me, with subtlety and slicht,
And with your breist, my tender breist dois hurt,
The crime is grit, gif it were countit richt,
That ye should gyd, me intil sic a sort.
Ceis, or I sall cause you to be persauid,
And schaw, how ye haif dressed me in this case,
The wikit auld wife, falsely hes desauid,
Me wretchit woman, wobegone allace:
Our nix nychbour, bot fra us litill space,
Heirs all our strife, and purpos may profane,
The wikit wife, that pat me in this place,
Hes me disauid, woe with her wikit trane.
I in this place, na longer will repair,
Nor yet it sal, our bodies bayth contene,
The auld wife sal not, me disaue na mair,
As sche hes done, by her disaitful mean:
Ye will be victor, and your will obtene,
Albeid agains you, I both strive and stray,
Yet not the les, our lufe decay sall clean,
And broken be, betwixt us two for ay,
Pamphilus speikis to Galathea.
IT us behouis, from farther to decist,
And to repose heir soliter alane,
That we may draw our endis at lenth and list,
After the renk and iorny we have taken:
Your angry eis, and visage wobegane,
Quhy schaw ye me, and will on na wais meis,
Your face, quhy wesch ye, making sic a mane,
With bitter teirs distelling from your eis.
The wite and blame, of all this crime I beir,
Correct me than, as ye your self desire,
And lat my punishment, be mair seueir,
Nor my deserving, dewly dois require:
I am content, for to sustene the hire,
Quhat punishment ye pleis on me to make,
And yet this deid, I na wais did conspire,
For I was witles of this crime and fact.
And gif ye please, let us pass as we can,
Before sum judge, quhair we may justice have,
That I may be maid clean, or guilty than,
With richt and resoun, as the cause dois crave:
Your cristall eis, surpassing all the laue,
Your flesch so white, your fair and fragrant face,
Your wourdis so sweit, the quhilk I did resaue,
Your kisses, with the quiet privy place.
Their forsaid things, did nurish me may fresh,
Unto this fact, may filthy and profane,
And cruel lufe, inflaming all my flesh,
Into their things, intisd me with a train:
The rage of lufe, so enterd in my brain,
That be their things, I did both burn and bruise,
Their things intisd me, I mon speik it plain,
Vnlesum deids, to follow and til use.
This wickit lufe, without respect or skill,
My senses hes peruertit all inteir,
Euin be the quhilk, my favor and gudwill,
Was na wais hard nor enterd, in your eir:
Of things quhairof, I am accusit heir,
Upon your self, the haill reproach should fall,
Because ye war the wall and water cleir,
And of my ill, the first original.
Great strife and anger, with ane ill intent,
Betwixt two lufers, aucht not to lie lang,
Bot gif it cum be chance or accident,
It should remain the schorter, them amang:
To lufers it dois properly belang,
The lufers falt, for to thole willingle,
And sumtime, patiently to suffer wrang,
Of sic a falt, I mean as common be.
Quhen the auld wife, returnis bak fra her feirs,
Your sadness I beseik you, to comport,
That sche persaue, nor ken not be your teirs,
That we are gilty, intill any sort.
Anus returns, saying their words.
A Ne nichbour wife, did stay me for to cum,
With nochtie wourdis, not tending to na sens,
Quha with her wourdis, wald vinqueis and orecum,
MARCUS, that orator of eloquens:
To hurt your eis, now quhat is your pretense,
With murning teirs, your body for to deir,
How cums this color, and great rubigence,
Quhilk in your visage, plainly dois apeir.
Quhen I was absent, out of sicht my sell,
Quhat PAMPHIL did, resolve me of that dout,
Now GALATHAE, I pray the for to tell,
All things in ourdour, as they are fallen out.
Galathea answers to Anus.
YOu speir, how that my chance hes interprisd,
As gif, you knew not of my great reuyne,
Seeing this thing, is subtly deuisd,
By your consent, and counsel of ingyne:
The tree is kend and knawin, gif it be fine,
Be the awin fruit, quhilk of it self outspreids,
I ken you likwais, quhilk hes done me pine,
Be all your actions and your outward deids.
Into your house, ye ordaind me frahand,
Apils and nuts, with other cheir beside,
Into your house, ye ordanid me frahand,
Apillis and nutis, with other cheir besyd,
Into the mean time, PAMPHILVS, did stand,
Befoir the zet quhair as he did abyd:
Ye fenzit that your nichbour on you cried,
That time micht serve the purpos for to speid,
And that I micht be spoilzit, and depryd,
Of my virginnitie, and maidinheid.
Quhat maid you, for to tarry forth with folk,
And fra your house, for to remane so lait,
Behauld how weil, your craft can hyd and clok,
The doubill deling, and the awin desait:
Disait and craft, into their awin estait,
Hes run their race, quhilk I may rue richt sair
I GALATHAE, am trapit and defait,
Into the net, and crafty subtle snair.
Anus answeris to Galathea.
I Am unjustly blamid, the treuth to tell,
Bot sic offense, mot far be put fra me,
For I sall purge and purify my sell,
By richt and resoun, as your self sall se:
The name of that crime, far dois disagre,
With my auld age, quhilk may make na releif,
My craft is not so curious, nor so he,
In wikit matters, tending to mischief.
Gif any strife, or wavering wourdis of wind,
To you hes chancit, concerning sic a case,
Quhat falt or crime, in me than can ye find,
Quho absent was, and out of present place:
Quhat ever it be, that dois you so disgrace,
I for my awin pairt, will my self acquit,
Your ardent lufe, with privy time and space,
Hes done the deid, quhairof I haif na wit.
Anus speakis to Pamphilus.
TEll to me PAMPHIL, gif it be thy will,
This mistik matter, quhilk I did not se,
Bot as to the beginning of this ill,
It is not neidfull to declair to me.
Pamphilus answers to Anus
GIf that ye knew, how for ane small commit,
Great occusatioun, now I do resaue,
Her anger is mair vehement and grit,
Nor my deserving, of it self can crave:
Us it behouis, may quietly to behave,
And lufers secreits, trewly to consceill,
Fra time that dolor pas, as we persaue,
Great schame it is, the secreits to reueill.
It you becums, na other gait to gang,
Bot for to meis the matter, I considder,
For it becums not, anger to last lang,
Betwixt us two, true lufers both togidder:
Galathea speakis to Pamphilus.
DEclair our doings to the auld wife now,
As gif that sche, them never knew nor kend,
That sche may understand the manner how,
That all this matter, hes been brocht till end:
To speir that thing at you, sche dois pretend,
Quhilk sche in counsall, did her self decre,
That sche micht seem, In that sche did offend,
Into na wais, for to have troublit me.
Ye and the wife, ambiguously but feir,
Hes trumpit me, as I the truth may tell,
The matter is maid evident and cleir,
Be the effects, and takins of it sell:
And as the fisch, after the taking snell,
Persauis the huke, quhen sche na mair may do,
Swa seis the mind of man, the fraud so fell,
And subtle snair, quhilk he is taken into.
Quhat sall I do, to quhat part sall I ply,
I wander man, throuch all the world astray,
My Parents justly, may me now deny,
And at their dur, debar me out for ay,
With wavering eis, I luke to every way,
Quhilis heir, quhilis their, in every airt athort,
I se na comfort, quhairvpoun to stay,
May caitif woman, void of all support.
Anus answers to Galathea.
IT sets not wise folkis, for so small a fact,
For to lament so sore, for sick malingis,
Seeing that dolor, may na profit make,
Nor to the master, na reward inbrings:
Thole patiently, and als except those things,
The quhilk by craft, can na wais mendit be,
And that immodrate lufe, quhilk in the rings,
The quhilk hes given, intisement unto the.
Wisdom I say, with good discretioun eik,
Thy murning teirs, should temper into tone,
And it becums the, counsall for to seik,
Quhat in this matter, titest should be done:
The hearts of lufers, quhilk should be abone,
By strife are hurt, with wapins may seueir,
For often times, discord wounds dois nourisch sone,
Be the awin battle, and unhappy weir.
Ilk ane with other, leid ane quiet life,
In piece and rest, lang time, for til abide,
That ye to him, may be ane lufing wife,
And he your husband on the other side:
Be menis and moyens, quhilk I did provide,
Ye have obtenid your haill desire, I say,
Be me, good fortoun to you did betide,
Thairfoir of me, have good remembrance ay.
FINIS.

THE ADITION OF THE TRANSLATER, IN FORM OF APPLICATION, upon the purpose going
before.
YE Damisels that are, both trest and true,
With wanton VENUS, se ye not repair,
The CIPRIAN dame, hes servants ay anew,
To take pure virgins, captifis in the snair,
Be lang intisment, and by crafty cair:
And be persuasion of ane wicket wife,
Mark, how this maid, has lost ane honestlife.
Ye shame your selfis, and lossis all your seill,
With wickit company, fra time ye use,
From CIRCES wisches, se ye keip you weill,
Quha be their fraud, all lufers dois abuse,
Their company, and fellowship refuse:
And se your eiris, of na wais be inclind,
To sick as be of the CANACES kind.
First fra ye enter, in that wanton trine,
It will appeir, for to be sum part dous,
Mark quhat sche hes resauid, for her propine,
Debard and banist, from her fathers house,
Sen sick things, may comoue you to corous:
Exampill take by CRATANAMINOST,
Quha for her lufe, both kin and country lost.
Out of your mindis, expel this thocht profane,
That CVPIDS hukis not enter in your heid,
Throw furious lufe, quhat number hes been slane,
Als weil of men, as women we may reid,
Without suport, or any more remeid:
Throw furious lufe, quhilk of it self is fell,
Dispairdly DIDO, did put down her sell.
Sic michte motions, lufers hartis dois move,
That nicht and day, they troublit ar and pynd,
Siclik CHARINA, slew her self throw love,
Sic was the madness enterd in her mind,
Lat not your eiris, to CUPID be inclynd:
Considring quhat, he daily dois subdew,
They happy ar, that can his snarris eschew.
For to behauld, the deidis of lufe ilk day,
The mindis of men, it wald make for to muse,
And lykwais SAPHO, slew her self I say,
Because that PHAON, did her lufe refuse,
The flamis of lufe, so did her hairt confuse:
Sche hairtburne was his bewteis til embrace,
Be ressoun of the favor of his face.
CUPID, by craft, can vinqueis and ouercum,
The hairts of lufers, that are every quhair,
With bestly lufe; he blindis the hairtis of sum,
And makis them for till fall into despair,
Howbeid Queen PASEPHE, lusty was and fair:
Sche left her housband quhilk was wonderful,
For to conuers, with ane may brutishe bull.
For to repeit this tail, my stomok grous,
Of CLITEMNESTRA, that vnhapie hure,
Quho murdreist AGAMENON, her awin spous,
For favor quhilk sche til EGESTVS bure,
Grit punischment, sche dewlie did procure:
Because sche did so filthilie offend,
May miserabill was her wikit end.
To CVPIDS counsall fra thou ans obey,
Thy carnal friends, thou drilie, bidis adieu,
Fair CILLIA, her father did betray,
For MINOS lufe, sik favor sche him schew,
She was not only doubill and untrue:
Bot lang time sche consceild it in her mind,
Howbeid, it was contrarius unto kind.
We neid not for to muse, nor wonder than,
To se the hartis and mindis of lufers move,
EVROPA left Prence ATRIVS her gudman,
And with his brother THEAST, fell in love,
This Princes than, was wordy of reprove:
Behauld, how sche hes vsid sick villainy,
Without respect of consanguinity.
PELLOPIA and MIRRA, I hard say,
Committit incest, as ye may consider,
Their ladies fair, with their awin fathers lay,
And carnally conioynd them selfis togider,
To take the man, that married had their mother:
With beistly lufe, they haif mair blindit been,
Nor modiwardis, that wantis both sicht and ene.
I do regrait, their stories are so rife,
The quhilk I do so copiously declair,
For SEMERAMVS, that was NINVS wife,
Incestuously lay with her son and air,
Of wemens staits, I will incist na mair:
Except this wourd, quhilk present I expres,
How CANACE, had her brother MACARES.
Wonder not of their women, quhilk ye se,
Descriuit heir, into their awin degreis,
Albeid, that men, the wichter veshels be,
Yet are they subject, to the same diseis,
This wanton dame, halds lufers at vaneis:
As be exampill, I sall plainly prove,
Duchtie ACHILLES, deit throw fervent love.
To se the hearts, of lufers so forlorn,
It wald make men for feir, to grudge and grieve,
BERNARDO, quho was ane Italian borne,
For lufe of LACON, did his life bereue,
To lie with her, because he gat not leave:
This furious fule, him slew incontinent,
Because he culd not cum to his intent.
Quhair raging lufe, intil a heart dois ring,
It wantis respect of honor and renoun,
We read, of ARTEMENIVS the King,
RAVINAS husband, quho did murdres down,
Only to lie with her, and play the loun:
This ARTEMENIVS sumtime king of Spain,
For his reward, was with the wild bests slain.
Mark and behold, quhat blindness hes been heir,
Concerning silly pure NARCISSUS case,
Quho past unto ane spring of water cleir,
Quhair he beheld, the shadow of his face,
Feign he desird, that figure till embrace:
Believing na wais, that it was him sell,
And so for lufe, he died beside the well.
Mair blindness, did this curious crafts man move,
Quhois laud and fame, liuis into money lands,
PIGMALION with the Pictur fell in love,
Quhilk he had portrait, with his awin two hands,
Howbeid this image, as ane Idol stands:
With blindit lufe, this man so far was led,
That it lay nichtly with him in the bed.
The duchtie, and may manly DAMIOVN,
Was pynd with lufe, and sine deid in despair,
And HERCULES, quho maid escamioun,
Of DEMERA, for YOLE so fair,
Of campions stout, king CUPID takis na cair:
Thocht SAMSON was of fortitude may frack,
Yet VENUS, was the wite of all his wrack.
In na kyn stait, so far as I can ken,
Bot VENUS is, ay reddie til intise,
For sumtimes, sche bereues the wits of men,
That are esteimd, to be may sage and wise,
Spy, how the hearts of men, sche can surprise:
For SOCRATES with flams of lufe aflocht,
May ardently, SOSIAS lufe besocht.
Sche gides the hearts, of mean men and of grit,
And be her menes, sche money brings to baill,
AURELIUS als, ane michtie man of wit,
With lufe of ladies, was inflamd alhail,
And syndrie times, he did their lufe assaill:
Bot because, she was fairest of them all,
MARTINAS lufe, he socht in special.
Of caitife folks, how beid, their be great store,
Ill with the good, we aucht not for to deem,
Of wickit women, as I writ before,
So sall I now, the praise of sum expreme,
Pudicitie, is meikill til esteem:
AMELIA, that virgin pure and leill,
From spot or blame, her body keipit weill.
Happy are they, can modesty meintene,
And ryn their rink, into the richteous rait,
LVCRECE sicklike, that constant Lady schene,
Into her time, lived in ane chaist estait,
Agains king CUPID, sche maid sick debait:
He culd not her, persuade to villainy,
And so schewan, the crown of chastity.
The fame sall leave, and for ane lang time lest,
Of sick as dois, demerit good commend,
DANNAT, the stait of chastity professed,
And did observe the samin to the end,
For by the gifts, that in her corpse was kend:
She was not only chaist, as is indite,
Bot intill all her actions, may perfect.
THISBE, sick lufe into her breast did beir,
Without respect, quhat perrill was to licht,
She met with PRIAM, her awin husband deir,
At NINVS tomb, into the feirfull nicht,
Behauld, gif that her heart hes been vpricht:
Quhat skaith micht cum of it, sche tuke na cure,
Sick was the lufe, sche to her husband bure.
PENELOPE, of patience may strange,
VLISSIS wife, that lady of great fame,
Quho notwithstanding, of his absence lang,
Remaind may constant, to his cumming hame,
Time to prolong, with sick as did her clame:
The web, quhilk sche in day licht wrocht with pane,
Into the nicht, undid it ay agane.
Lat sick beir blame, as drinks in CVPIDS cap,
And of the virtuous, lat renoun reueiue,
Thocht sum be Crocadils in VENUS schap,
Yet sum their be, quhois fame for ay sall leiue,
As did this dame, quho weill her web culd weiue:
The virtuous damis, sall live ir. laud and fame,
Bot the dishonest, sall resaue a schame.
Thocht their was sum, that rashly zeid about,
Throw furious lufe, them selfis for to put down,
Of good men now, the prais I will pent out,
Quho for their constant lufe, deserfis the croun,
The richteous, sall still flurish in renoun:
Albeid, that sum were whelps of Tigers kind,
Yet sum their be, that better were inclind.
Mark gif this man, demerits good commend,
Quho being, bot ane young adolescent,
True TROYELVS, was constant to the end,
And in his lufe, was na wais varient,
Bot still to ane, he keipit true intent:
In barnely age, and puerilitie,
Ye may persaue, the spreit of constancy.
Happy is he, that hes a lufing heart,
To his half marrow, in an ernest sort,
King PRIAM keipit ane may kindly part,
Unto his spouse, as Poets maks report,
This I man say, in few wourdis to be schort:
Quhair discord dwells, quhilk lufe exiles alace,
Na grace can grow, nor plesour can have place.
THE AMPHILVS, a native borne Greik,
Quhois deith, be women aucht to be deplord,
Him cled in sack cleith, quhen his wife lay seik,
Until the time, God had her health restord,
His name and fame, aucht for to be decord,
Because, to fast and pray, he did not fache,
At every time, quhen that sche tuke a brache.
I schew of sic, as into lufe did burn,
And of the patient, I haife spoken eik,
Bot to my former sudiet to return,
Of PAMPHILVS, I will a few wourds speik,
He is to lack, and scarcely with ane leik:
Quho hes not wyn his lufe throw cheualrie,
Bot be the menes of Macrels as ye se.
Great prais pertenis, renoun and honor hie,
And in all pairts, their laud and fame proceids,
That either wins their lufis, ventoriouslie,
Or else, be martial, and may duchty deids,
Dispising sick, as out of bounds exceids:
As did THESEUS, of quhom, VIRGIL dois tell,
Quho for his lufe, descendit down to hell.
HERO that lady, quho did hearts allure,
And for her fairnes, gat a great renoun,
For lufe the quhilk, LEANDER till her bure,
He venture tuke, to saill to Sectus town,
The storm was great, and so he chanst to droun:
Thocht his pretense, was for to win a fame,
His rasch attempt, is in a part to blame.
HECTOR, quho was a magnanimious man,
Faucht for his lufe, with Lords of Lauine land,
And HANIBALL his lufe, and maistres wan,
Throw martial deids, I mean, be speir and brand,
Their honest acts, all men may understand:
Quhairfoir, their Knights, still flurishis in fame,
Bot PAMPHILVS, resauis reproach and schame.
Stout TVRNVS, did na skaith, nor danger dout,
To seik his lufe, amang the wild wood treis,
And Prince ENAE, both valiant, wise and stout,
To Latin land, did nauigat the Seas,
Quhair he ariuid, according to decreis:
And for the mair performance of his vowis,
King LATINS dochter, he did take to spowis.
Sum takis delight, for to make sturt and strife,
And godly interprises to prevent,
ALLECTO did seduce, king LATINS wife,
That to that marage, sche should not consent,
King LATINS self, thairwith was weill content:
And brocht that block to end, may honorably,
Albeid, ALLECTO thocht it should not be.
Sum for their vertew, wins ane nobill name,
And sum dishonor, for their filthy factis,
Their valiant Knichts, deseruis a worthy fame,
Be resoun of their ventrous deids and actis,
They bair ane good report, behind their backis:
And specially, the Duke ANDROGION,
Quho for his maistres, saild to Magilon.

TO THE READER.
MY willing mind, I pray the not refuse,
Sen little praise may recompense my pain.
Bot I beseik the, that thou wald excuse,
The unripe seids of my may barren brain:
My rural verse, I pray the not profane,
Thocht they proceid, from ane may ruslick spring,
Nor my good purpose, se thou not disdain,
Ane Prences praise, sen that I preis to sing:
And sen I have been bauld, to write this thing,
Quhilk pregnant Poets, justly may dereid,
First, I crave pardon of our sovereign King,
And sine of you, quho sall the samin reid,
Not that I have done you so great offense,
As to the persoun, of our nobill Prence.
BE HONOR I LEVE.
AN APLICATION CONCERNING OUR KINGS MAJESTY'S PERSOVN.
I Will decist, ma notes for till imbring,
Of sik as did, their ventrous spreits employ,
Bot let us praise, our Prence and native king,
KING JAMES the sixth, that richt redouted Roy,
Gif ye wald mark, his courage and conuoy:
He dois deserve, far greter laud and glore,
Nor all the rest, reherst herein before.
I wisch at God, if it were not offense,
And als I crave into their present dais,
For to have sum of CICEROS eloquence,
Together with ane part of OVIDS frais,
That I micht speik, into this Prences prais:
Quha for his wisdom, and ventorious deids,
All other Monarchis, in the world exceids.
STRABO dois write, in his cosmographie,
And TITUS LIVIVS, as I understand,
How PARIS past, and saild to Greece by Sie,
To ravish HELENE, lady of that land,
Quhair he fair HELENE, in her palace fand:
Thocht Poets of his duchtie deids declair,
Yet PARIS to our Prence is na compair.
PARIS performd ane may ungodly gyse,
Quhilk after tendit, to great sturt and strife,
Bot our Prence, had ane honest interpryse,
He saild the sea, to fetch his nobill wife,
His interprise, gart moan los their life, Paris

Bot blist be God, ours come to better end,
Than Judge quho dois demerit may commend.
JASON that valient knight, quho dwelt in Greice,
To COLCHOS came, unto ane dame may fair,
Bot fra time, that he gat the goldin fleice,
He with MEDEA, wald remane na mair,
Thoch he was duchte, as they do declair:
Yet was this Knight, may wordie to dispyis,
Quha past away, but pity of her cryis.
This prence but peir, and lamp of God elect,
Quhome to great prais, dois dewly apertene,
Unto MEDEA, had far mair respect,
Nor he had to the goldin fleis I mean,
I mean our King respekit, mair our Queen:
Sic gracis in her persoun, did apeir,
That he regardit, nether gold nor geir.
Quhat Prence, this prences wald in mind omit,
Considring quhat great gifts, in her apeirs,
Sche is a second SABA, for her wit,
Lang mot sche leave, in NESTORS happy yeirs
In lufe and favor, as it best effeirs:
And in good stait, a lang time for to stand,
To be ane gouernatrix of this land.
Ane ill report, the persoun ay rejakis,
Bot honnest fame, sall never faid nor faill,
Of fair EVPHINIA sum men mentioun makis,
Of Corynth land, the heritrix all haill,
How mekil fire procedis, bot from a spaill:
Althocht sche was grave, constant and degest,
One imperfectioun, stenzit all the rest.
This imperfectioun, ye sall sone persaue,
And as it stands, I fall the matter tell,
Sche mariet ACHARIST, her fathers slave,
Dishonoring, both the cuntry and her sell,
Sum women be of ane complexioun fell:
Quha dois resembill, the Basilik flour,
Quhilk changis hewis, and colors every hour,
To count their thingis, occasions me compels,
That Queens take Kings, and vilipend a Squire,
Our souerane Queen, this prencis far excels,
Thocht sche of Corynth, had the haill impire,
Till any prences, sche may weil espire:
Because sche hes espousit, for her feir,
Ane nobill prence, quhois persoun hes na peir.
Laud to thois Ladeis, that their cuntries leuis,
To be conjoynd, with wise and nobill Kingis,
For to their cuntry, it great comfort geuis,
Quhair be the contrair, it dishonor bringis,
Concerning sic misgiding, and malingis:
Luk how great schame, the Corynthis did resaue,
Als mekill honor, may the Densis have.
As wikit folkis, ar for their vice abhord,
So for their good, the godly gets commend,
We should give praise, and laud unto the Lord,
That sik a virtuous dame is till us send,
Good qualities, intill her corpse are kend:
As precious stains, gifis glancing in the nicht,
So schins her gracis in the pepils sicht.
Her cumly fame, in sick a stait dois stand,
That MOMVS self, na imperfectioun knawis,
The precious stains, that are in Persie land,
Into their naturs, not sick splendeur schawis,
Her fame and name, out throw this country blawis:
In gudly gracis, so sche dois excel,
For by her gifts, sche beirs dame bewties bell.
As heit from fire, can not be taken away,
Quhair ingle is, with fiery flamis anew,
Na mair can lufe, deminish or decay,
Betwixt two lufers, that are traist and true,
I neid not often, their namis for to renew:
Quhat lufe hes been, betwixt two prences heir,
The awin effect, have maid the matter cleir.
ANNA our Queen, of nobill royal blud,
Quhom now our Sovereign, hes chosin for his feir,
Respectit sche, the Boriall blasts so rud,
To take the hasert, till her husband deir,
Bot in the cumming to this cuntry heir:
Her self I say, and all her company,
With stormy winds, were troublit on the Se.
As PALINVRVS Pilot, till ENAE,
Throw storm of wind, out of the way did mar,
Euin so the tempest raise, amang them swae,
That scarce they kend the pairt, quhairin they war,
Na wounder was, howbeid they went a scar:
For THETIS was, in sick a rage and ire,
That all her fluds appeird, like flams of fire.
In nauigating, to our nobill Prence,
Upon the Sea, sche sufferd meikill pain,
For ZEPHIRVS blew, with sick violence,
Schewes constraind, for to turn back again,
Considring, how the storm did still remain:
And how the raging wadder, was so rud,
Her gracis persoun, in great perrill stud.
To pas to her, our Prence than tuke consart,
Suppose the matter, syndrie did displeis,
Quho hering tell, of this her troublous stait,
And how sche was, so tossit on the Seis,
This duchtie Prence, deliberats and decreis:
To sail to Denmark, to his darling deir,
Without respect, unto the time of yeir.
To sick a Prence, so pissant and so hie,
The interpryse, was ventrous for to tell,
In winter seasoun, for to tak the Se,
Quhen SATVRN did, his frostie teirs distell,
Thy richteous fame, sen na man can repel:
May hardy COCLES, lang time mot thou leiue,
That their thy deids, may thy renoun reueiue,
Sen sick ventoriousnes, is in a King,
I think it should, make mean men to be frack,
Think ye that this, was any little thing,
Himself to hasert, on NEPTVNVS bak,
Quhair CAPHARVS, quhilk Schips and botis dois wrak:
Lies in the Sea, beside the sands so schald,
With other dangers, dreidfull to behald:
Respectit he, the perrilous scapie rock,
Quhair TRITON plais, that monstrous ugly page,
Or caird he by CARIBDIS feirfull chok,
Quhair SCILAS dogs, both nicht and day dois rage,
This valiant Prence, both ventrous, wise and sage:
Their perrils great, respekit not a Preine,
So fast he langd, to se his lusty Queine.
Respectit he, the furious raging Sie,
Or of God AEOLVS, did he take cair,
Or of the father of Malancolie,
Quhilk rang into the regioun of the air,
Their perrils, na wais moved him to despair:
Sick courage did consist, into him sell,
That his good purpose, did all feir expel.
He tuke na thocht, of CICLOPS cragie cleuch,
Nor Sirtes sands, his courage did not move,
O APIVS, thy skeill was scant aneuch,
For till have framd, ane schip for his behoue,
Namely throw Sea, a Monarche to remove:
Abounding greatly, into gifts of grace,
Proceiding both, of MARS and PALACE race.
This valiant King, justly deseruis the croun,
Lang mot he live, with sick a worthy name,
His ventrous acts, and royal hie renoun,
Ingrauit is, within the house of fame,
But any spot, infirmity or blame:
O God, gif it, a great rejoicing be,
Sick properties, intill a Prence to se.
Unto the crafty Crocadils false teirs,
With confidence, thou never did confide,
O wise ULYSSES, with thy waxit eirs,
That did eschew, the CYREN songs aside,
So weill thy self, thou did govern and gide:
Howbeid, occasioun often times did procure,
From CVPIDS schots, thy corpse was keipit sure.
Ye furious lufers, but respect or cair,
That for ane seasoun, liuis in lufe profane,
Unto the stra, your persons I compair,
Quhilk kendils sone, and sone slakis out agane,
They lufe a space, to pacify their pane:
Thocht it from feruensie, dois na wais flow,
And so they woundit are, with CVPIDS bow.
Ane parabill may apt, I will repeit,
Quhilk to true lufers, justly dois belang,
Albeid, that iroun be slow to take a heit,
Yet being het, it halds the samin lang,
Seeing the stra, is na material strange:
Full water sone, sick fiery flamis may stell,
Bot ardent heit, is ill for till expel.
How far are lufers, for to lake alace,
That for ane schort time, only lufe menteens,
His highness, I compair into this case,
Unto the iroun, as properly perteens,
In honor we may speik, of Kings and Queens:
Thocht heit was slaw, to enter in his vains,
May ardently with him, it now remains.
He being sick a abill pleasant plant,
As in our natioun, never rang before,
This was na small gift, as our selfis may grant,
For by great gifts, the quhilk he hes in store,
We have good cause, his honor to decore:
And to rejoice, upon ane good pretense,
That God hes send us sick a prudent Prence.
His laud and fame, is widely blawn abrod,
Because himself, so weill he hes behauid,
Na dout, bot he, is welbelou'd of God,
Quha at his hands, sick gracis hes resauid,
Good properties, may plainly be persauid:
Into this Prence, and monarche of great micht,
God grant that he, may use his gracis richt.
Concerning his departure, from this land,
Unto ane cuntry vncow, and unkind,
His haill attempts, quhilk he hes taken in hand,
God hes them blist, and brocht them to good end,
With all the actions, quhilk he did intend:
Gif that his grace, wald with himself confar,
Unto his God, he is addettit far.
This God hes been, may merciful I mean,
In doing and performing his decreis,
Quha of his Schip, hes prenspall pilat been,
And him conductit saifly throw the Seis,
The Lord will luke, with kind and loving eis:
On sic as dois their faith, upon him found,
And from all dangers, keip them saife and sound.
From perrils, he his persoun did prevent,
So cairfully, from skaith he did him keipe,
Quhair raging wauis, and waters turbilent,
Did flow and fleet, into the dangerous deipe,
His wakrife eis, dois walk and never sleipe:
Over Heuin, earth, hell, and every living thing,
And he of Sea and land, is Lord and king.
From Heuin so hie, he seis all things belaw,
And of his awin, he hes great cair and cure,
From storms of wind, and tempests that did blaw,
His michtie power, preserved him saife and sure,
His divine power, quhilk ever sall endure:
Can calm great storms, and make them to be still,
All creaturs, obais his blessit will.
Our nobill Prence, may pregnant into wit,
Now with his Queen, conioynd in marage band,
This gracious God, quhois mercies ar may grit,
Hes brocht them both, in saifty to this land,
I pray the Lord, lang that their stait may stand:
That God thairby, may glore and honor have,
And that the cuntry comfort may resaue.
Sen God above, be his hie power divine,
Hes the conductit, at thy hearts desire,
It the becums, this Pilot to propine,
With rich rewards, in recompense of hire,
Because he was, thy gide and only squire,
With doubill thanks, for by his Pilot fe,
Weill he deseruis, rewardit for to be.
He was thy ankour, and thy only chance,
Together with thy cabill tow so teuch,
This Pilot, thou can never recompance,
Nor zit, with thanks, reward him weill aneuch,
He can preserve thy Schip, from craig and cleuch:
O gif that kippage blist, and happy be,
Hes sick a Pilot in their compane.
Wardly rewards, this Pilot will not haife,
For gold nor geir, he dois not seik nor clame,
Bot the reward and wage, quhilk he dois craife,
Is praise and honor, to his holy name,
May valiant Prence, of nobill brute and fame:
Sen that his mercy, did thy Schip mentene,
Gif praise to God, quho hes thy Pilot been.
Forzet not for to thank him day and nicht,
Quho did thy interprise, so weill aply,
And in this land, his name cause reverence richt,
So far as it into thy handis dois ly,
Trators to God, seik out and warly try:
Good men mentene, and punish that opres,
So sall thy actions, haif ane good succes.
Sen God hes geuin, the swourd into thy hand,
And the promotit, to ane Kingly place,
Lat justice likwais, flurish in this land,
So sall the Lord bestow, his giftis of grace,
In doing this, he sall mentene thy race:
And thou of all men, sall receive commend,
With praise immortal, to the warlds end.
As CLIOMINVS, King of Cret, be God,
Was for his justice, estemat may sure,
So let thy fame, be likwais blawin abrod,
In doing justice, both to rich and pure,
Like to the Laurel leife, thy fau^e sall flure,
And thou not only, sall in honor leiue,
Bot thy renoun, sall mair and mair reveiue.
I pray the Lord, thy nobill stait mentene,
In piece and rest, lang time for to proceid,
Lang for to live, with thy may lusty Queen,
That we may se, sum of thy nobill seid,
Like to the vinetre, that the same may spreid:
And like a frutfull tree, for to acres,
God of his grace, to send the good succes.
Thou CALIOP, that wryts of ventrous acts,
Thy ornat pen, I pray the to prepair,
And THALIDA, that wryts of famous facts,
Into thy Chronikils, his deids declair,
To pen his praise, ze Poets do not spair:
And I beseik, you Musis every one,
To praise this Prence, with mouthis of Helicone.

BE HONOR I LEVE.
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE QVEENS MAJESTY'S MAY HONORABLE ENTRY INTO THE TOVN OF
EDINBVRGH, UPON THE 19. DAY OF MAII. 1590.
AT Edinburgh, as micht be seen,
Upon the nintene day of Maj,
Our Prences spous, and sovereign queen
Her nobil entry maid that day,
May honorable, was her conuoy,
With gladness great, triumph and joy.
To recreat, her hie renoun,
Of curious things, their was all sort,
The stairs and houses of the town,
With Tapestries, were spread athort:
Quhair Histories, men micht behauld,
With Imagis, and antiks auld.
No man in mind, culd weill consaue,
The curious warks, before his eis,
In Tapestries, ye micht persaue,
Young Ramel, wrocht like laurel treis:
With syndrie sorts of Chalandrie,
In curious form of Carpentrie.
It written was, with stories mae,
How VENUS, with a thundering thud,
Inclosd ACHATES and ENAE,
Within a mekill mistie clud:
And how fair ANNA wondrous wraith,
Deplors her sister DIDOS daith.
Their was the blindit artchour boy,
Schuting crafty INTICLOTES,
Their was discriu'd, the wrack of Troy,
And how the proud PHILOCLITES:
Schot prudent PARIS throw the thie,
With poisond dart, quhilk gart him die.
Io, with her goldin glitring hair,
Was portret wondrous properly,
And POLIPHEME, was pentit their,
Quha in his foreheid had ane eye:
Beneth him bot ane litill space,
Was IANVS, with the doubill face.
Of ROMOLVS, I saw the wonder,
How for his interprise profane,
In counterfeting of the thunder,
For his reward, thairwith was slane:
And their was wrocht, with goldin threid,
MEDVSA, with the monstrus heid.
Of historeis, I saw anew,
That fragill were, and friuolus,
How TRITON, at the Sea side slew,
MISENVS, son to AEOLVS:
Beside that history their stands,
BRIARIVS, with his hundredth hands.
The story of ACHILLES stout,
With gold was browderd their abreid,
And how wise PALACE, did spring out,
At michtie IVPITERS foreheid:
And ICARVS, throw fleing hie,
With waxit wingis fell in these.
How IAON, SESRA did persew,
And drove ane naill into his brow,
And IEPHTE, quho his dochter slew,
For till observe his oath and vow:
And how that all great NILVS flud,
Was turned and alterd into blud.
How JOVE did with the Giants do,
And how of them he vaslage wan,
Their PHOCOMES, was portrait to,
Quho beirs both schap of horse and man:
And how that he gat throw the hairt,
Throw schot of MOPSIS deidlie dairt.
IXION, that the quheill dois turn,
In Hell, that ugly hole so mirk,
And EROSTRATVS, quha did burn,
The costly fair EPHESIEN Kirk:
And BLIADES, quho falls in soun,
With drawing buckets up and down.
As MERCVRIE, with charmit rods,
The hundredth eis of ARGVS traps,
And how that TIPHON chaste the gods,
Compelling them to change their schaps:
For PHEBVS, was turned in a cat,
And VENUS, in a fiche may flat.
Their things were patent to the eis,
Of sindry as ye know your sell,
For they were into tapestreis,
Better descriu'd nor I can tell:
Their I beheld quhair I did go,
With money hundredth thousand mo.
Brave nobill men, of all kin sorts,
Triumphantly, beside her raid,
First at her entry, at the ports,
Trim Harangs, till her grace was maid,
Her salutatioun, their was sung,
In ornat style, of Latin tongue.
Gif ILIONVS, had been their,
That orator of eloquence,
I doubt, gif he could have done mair,
For all his great intelligence:
Declaring with a great renown,
How sche was welcome to the town.
Nor DEMADES, quhois prais is pend,
In every part as we persaue,
Quho for his ornat style was send,
Till ANTIPATER piece to crave:
Thocht he was eloquent and wise,
Na finer frais, he culd devise.
All curious pastimes and consaits,
Culd be imaginat be man,
Was to be seen on Edinburgh gaits:
Fra time that brauitie began:
Ye micht haif hard on every streit,
Trym melody, and music sweit.
Thocht PHILAMON, his braith had blawin,
For music, quho was countit king,
His trumpal tune, had not ben knawin,
Sic sugrit voycis, their did sing,
For their the dascant did abound,
With the sweit diapason sound.
Tennour, and trebill with sweit sense,
Ilkane with pairts, gaif nots agane,
Fabourdoun fell, with decadence,
With priksang, and the singing plane:
Their enfants sang, and barnely brudis,
Quho had bot new begun the mudis.
Musiciners, their pairts expond,
And als for joy, the bellis were rung,
The instruments, did corospond,
Unto the music, quhilk was sung:
All sort of instruments, were their,
As sindry can, the same declair.
Organs and Regals, their did carpe,
With their gay goldin glittring strings,
Their was the Hautbois and the Harp,
Playing may sweit and pleasant springs:
And sum on Lutis, did play and sing,
Of instruments, the only King.
Viols and Virginals were heir,
With Girthorns, may iucundious,
Trumpets and Tymbrels, maid great beir,
With instruments melodious:
The Seistar and the Sumphion,
With Clarche pipe and Clarion.
Their notes seemd heuinly sweit and hie,
And not like tunes terrestrial,
APOLLO their, appeird to be,
Their sound, was so celestial:
O PAN, amang sick pleasant plais,
Thy rustik pipe, can have na prais.
Thocht ORPHEUS, gat great commend,
For melody, and good ingine,
His cumly springs, had not been kend,
Howbeid, that they were may divine:
Nor AMPHION, quho did begin,
Na honor heir, he culd have wyn.
ANNA, our welbelouit Queen,
Sat in her goldin Coche so bricht,
And after sche, their things had seen,
Syne she beheld, ane heuinly sicht:
Of Nymphs, quho supit NECTAR cauld,
Quhois brauities, can scarce be tauld.
Their Nymphs, were plantit in this place,
As money thousands, micht persaue,
Quho for their bewties and good grace,
Were chosin out amangst the laue:
DIANAS Nymphs, they may be namd,
Beressoun, they were vndefamd.
The circumstance can not be told,
So strange, the matter dois apeir,
Sum were cled into claith of gold,
And sum in silver, schining cleir:
Their gouns, gave glancing in the mark,
They were so wrocht, with goldsmith warke.
Mair brauer robes, were never bocht,
Queen SEMERAMVS, til array,
With brodrie warke, their bords were wrocht,
O God, gif that that their gouns was gay:
With gubert warke, wrocht wondrous sure,
Purfild with gold and silver pure.
This far I may, their Nymphs advance,
Not speking rashly, by the richt,
Their goldin robes, gave not sick glance,
As did their heuinly bewties bricht:
Nor zit, their jewels in sic greis,
As did their cumly cristall eis.
Their properties, for to repeit,
My dull ingine, can not disclose,
Their hair, like threids of gold did gleit,
Their facis, fragrant and formose:
White was their hyd, thocht it was hid,
Their coral lips, like rosis rid.
Sick Parragons, but peir or maik,
I wart, was never seen before,
Na properties, their Nymphs did laik,
Quhilk micht, their cumly corpse decore:
All gifts, quhilk creaturs can clame,
Dame nature, in their corpse did frame.
O DIONER, that hes the place,
And beirs Dame bewties bell, I say,
And thou O DAPHNE, fair of face,
Quha was the God APOLLOS pray:
Gif that, their virgens had been their,
He had esteemd them meikill mair.
O EVROPA, as Poets schaws,
Quhome IVPITER did lufe indeid,
He had acquit the, for their cause,
Gif they had been, into thy steid:
He had not faild, this for to do,
And PARIS likwais, HELEN to.
Had they been set, in PARIS sight,
As was the Goddessis, I mean,
He scarce culd have, discernit richt,
Quhome to the Apill did pertene:
Sick equal gifts, were in them ludgt,
That they culd skantlie weill be iudgt.
Their nobill Nymphis, maid reverence,
With gesture lively and allairt,
And after their obedience,
Her Grace past to ane other pairt:
Quhair sche, beheld sum to be schort,
A coutert, in ane sauadge sort.
Into the service of our Queen,
They offert their may willing mynds,
Their are the MOIRS, of quhom I mean,
Quha dois inhabit in the ynds:
Leuing their land and dwelling place,
For to do honor to her Grace.
They have na scant, nor indigence,
Quhair they do dwell, and have exces,
Nor zit they have na residence,
With PHAVNVS, God of wilderness:
Bot they do dwell, quhair they were wont,
Beside SYNERDAS goldin mont.
Their precious Jewels till expreme,
And costly clethings to discriue,
My simple wit cannot esteem,
Agains the streme, quhy should I strive:
Thocht I want language, wit and lair,
Yet as I can, I sall declair.
Their sauagis, I you assure,
Were weil decord, as ye may know,
For sum were cled in silver pure,
And sum in Taffatie, white like snaw*
Ay two and two, in ordour stands,
With battons blank, into their hands.
The precious stains, can not be pend,
With goldsmithis wark, was them amang,
Their bodies skantly culd be kend,
For cheins, quhilk over their shoulders hang:
Gold bracelets, on their chakils hings,
Their fingers full, of costly rings.
That sicht, was pleasant for to se,
And woundrous nobill, to behold,
Their heids were garnisht gallandlie,
With costly crancis, maid of gold:
Braid blancis, hang above their eis,
With jewels of all Histories.
Upon their forebrows, they did beir,
Targats and Tablets, of trim warks,
Pendants and Carcants, shining cleir,
With Plumagis of gitie sparks:
Upon their hyndheids, set was syne,
Buttons and brotchis, brave and fine.
And Mairatour, I call to mind,
How every ane, had on their front,
Ane Charbuncle of rubie kind,
Together with ane Diamont:
And down their Haffats hang anew,
Of Rubeis red, and Saphirs blew.
Into their mouthis, as micht be seen,
Quha had been tentife to behold,
Ane Emerauld, of color green,
Set in ane pretty ring of gold:
Syne their was hung, at their hals bane,
The Espinell, a precious stane.
Upon their breast, brauest of all,
Were precious pearls of the Eist,
The Rubie pallet and Th'opall,
Together with the Amatist:
Their micht ye se mangs move mo,
The Topas and the Percudo.
Vpoun their richt pape may perfect,
Their I saw sindry stains beset,
The Garned and the Agat quhyte,
With moan mo, quhilk I forzet:
Besid their two did hing alone,
The Turcas and the Triapone.
Vpoun the left were likwais knit,
Two proper stains of valor hie,
The Iasynth, and the Chessolit,
Jewels may excellent to se:
Amangs the rest I saw athort,
The Rubie of the rarest sort.
Fornents their Nauillis every one,
Bure precius Jewels brave and deir,
The Cornalene and Calcedon,
Quhilk of it self is quhyte and cleir:
They bure the Orphir on their back,
Bot and the Onix gray and black.
All precius stains micht their be fene,
Quhilk in the world had any name,
Save that quhilk CEFOPATRA Queen,
Did swallow ore into her wame:
The verity for till expres,
That was not their I mon confess.
In Indea that goldin ground,
Mair brauitie culd never be,
The belts quhairwith their waists were bound
Were goldin cheins as ye micht se:
Also with cheins both in and out,
Their arms were womplit round about.
Let no man me esteem to raill,
Nor think that raschelie I report,
Their these were likewais garnist haill,
With gold cheins of that saming sort:
Their girtens were of gold bestreik,
Their Legs thairwith were furneist eik,
Fra top to tae I you assure,
Their corpse with gold was birnist bricht,
They on their feit, white buskins wure,
Of costly skins, both trim and ticht:
To tell the treuth, and not to lie,
That sicht was pleasant for to se.
Ilk ane in ordour keipit place,
Als weill the formest as the last,
Their MOIRS, did mertch befoir her grace,
Quhile sche intill her Palace past:
Far better bakit, nor ane Lord,
With Burgisses to be their gaird.
I have forzet, how in a Robe,
Of clenely crispe, side to his kneis,
A bony boy out of the Globe,
Gave to her grace, the silver Keis:
And how that he his harang maid,
With countenance, quhilk did not faid,
Als I forzet, how was declaird,
Our nobill Kings genalogie,
And now the folks, quha were in ward,
Were freely set at liberty:
For to be schort, they spent that day,
In pastime, daliance and deray.
Forzetting als, the Burgis tryne,
Without discriptioun of their case,
Not speiking of the rich propine,
Quhilk they did give unto her grace:
Nor how they bure the vaill abreid,
Quhilk hang above her gracis heid.
Gif I in mind, should nocht omit,
Bot intill ordour, all resolve,
The vollume, wald be woundrous grit,
And very tedious to reuolue:
Leuing the rest for to declair,
Unto their memors, quho were their.
The Burgessis may honorably,
Vpoun her grace, did still atend,
To time the haill solemnity,
And trim triumph was put to end:
Sum special men, that were imployd,
Into her palace her conuoyd.
The number of them that were their,
I sall discriue them as I can,
My Lord I mean the master Mair,
The Prouest ane may prudent man:
With the haill counsall of the town
Ilkane cled in a velvet goun.
That company, quha did espy,
The matter was magnificall,
The other Burgissis forby,
Were cled in their pontifical:
Presenting them before her face,
Offering their service to her grace.
Dout my dull sensis dois desaue,
With mair magnificence I mean,
Gif that the Persians did resaue,
King DARIUS wife that nobill Queen:
Quhen sche did enter with renown,
In Tipatra that nobill town.
O Edinburghe now will I sing,
Thy prais quhilk the perteins of richt,
Thou hes been ay true to thy King,
In doing service day and nicht:
Quhen that his grace did haif ado,
And in the fields ay formest to.
Not sparing for to spend their blud,
Into their breists they bure sic love,
I say no more, so I conclud,
Bot I beseik the God above:
Gif that it be his godly will,
That thy estait may fluris still.
FINIS.
BE HONOR I LEVE.
THE PASSAGE OF THE PILGREMER, DEVIDIT INTO TVVA PAIRTS.
AS I went throw ane wood savage,
As did AENEAS to Carthage,
Compast with clouds about,
I wanderd, and I wist not quhair,
As ane mad man, into despair:
astonished to win out.
The wode was great, and wondrous lang,
Of lenth and largitude,
The treis thairof, war stark and strange,
And full of fortitude:
Amasing, and gasing,
Their treis for to behald,
So schenlie, and menelie,
Their tops they did dounfald.
I saw the Ashtre and the Aik,
That AEOLVS gart yield and zaik,
By his may bitter blast,
Thocht they were strange, he gart them stoup
And all the trees into that troup,
That war affixit fast:
The storm so bitterly brake out,
as wonder was to se,
The boriall blasts, with money schout,
In that forest did fle:
Not caldly, bot baldlie,
They thudit throw the treis,
With rairding, and fairding,
On hie the fire fleis.
The air, was than intemperate,
And with rubies skies, ranculat,
Mixit with weit and wind,
And every fleing foul that fed,
Ran bissilie hame to their bed,
Rest and repose to find,
Not only fleing fouls I say,
Bot beists of diverse kynds,
Laich on the ground, richt lawly lay,
Amasit in their mynds:
Sum shaking, and quaking,
For feir, as I esteem,
Oretowting, and rowting,
Into that storm extreme.
The Lion and the Leopard,
From louping, and scouping war skard,
And feign for to fall down,
And als, the awful Unicorn,
For all his bost, was not forborne,
Thocht he was nixt the croun:
Likwais the Beir, that bitter beist,
Was fellonlie afraid,
And all the Wolfis, ran west and eist,
Trowing to be betrayed:
Deploring, and roaring,
Was in that wilderness,
Sum lying, sum trying,
The course of cairfulnes.
The Drummadrareis left their feists,
With Tigers and tyrannius beists,
They war so feign to flit,
Their was the false Camelion,
With the big Eliphant anon,
A beist of body grit,
Howbeid, he be may corpolent,
Zit durst he not repose,
Quhair he was wont for to frequent,
The storm so strangely rose:
Their two now, did go now,
Sum solit pairt to find,
To waird them, and gaird them,
From bitter blaists of wind.
The Heart, with his fair forked horns,
Quhois pikes is sharp, as any thorns:
Richt lawly did down ly,
So fast the Deir ran to his den,
His color, I culd skantlie ken,
Or portrature espy.
The wily Tod came by me to,
With violence and speid,
For feir the he Fox, left the scho,
He was in sick a dreid:
Quhiles louping, and scowping,
Over bushis, banks, and brais,
Quhiles wandering, quhiles dandring,
Like royd and wilzart raise.
The Wildbair, that wanhappie beist,
Quhois tusks of lenth, war at the leist,
Ane quarter lang and mair,
Into ane fury, he ran fast,
Throw all the placis quhair he past,
With money rout and rair:
Also the Wood Dog, did sicklike,
The storm for till eschew,
This cruel and tyrannius tyke,
Upon the hard treis knew:
No swaging, his raging,
Micht mittigat or meis,
Sick badnes, and madness,
Throw kind he did aqueis.
The Wildcat worst of all the laue,
Into that pairt I did persaue,
Fleing for his refuge,
The storm was so outragius,
And with rumlings oragius,
That I for fear did gruge:
Than out that come the akquair Aip,
That Murgens wont to make,
Richt narowly I saw him scaip,
Vnbreking of his bak:
He hang so, and flang so,
Fast felterd be the feit*
His haist than, had may than,
Cost him ane winding sheit.
Out come the gyrnen Gennet syne,
With other twas^m in a tryne,
All of ane quantity,
For faircenes, sum fell on their face,
So raschely they ran out their race,
To keip good company:
Their was na bus, culd hald them bak,
So trimly they culd scoup,
Nor yet no Tike, culd them oretak,
So lichtlly they did loup:
Not playing, but braying,
To se that tempest than,
Amaisdlie, and baisdlie,
Richt bissilie they ran.
Their was the Pikit Porcapie,
The Cunning, and the Con all thrie,
Merchen amangs the rest,
I wat they wantit na good will,
To ryn with all speid possibill,
Quhill they wan to their nest:
Also the Hare I have forzet,
The spediest of all,
His hasty rinning maid him het,
Nane neidit him to call:
Not tyring, nor myring,
Among the mossis deipe,
Bot tichtly, and richtly,
His awin course he did keipe.
Out come the Edder at the last,
Upon his wamb crieping full fast,
Seikand ane hole to hyde him,
Bot because he was venimus,
And for to touch contagius,
No beist wald bide beside him:
Upon his wamb thus wayis he went,
May miserably their,
For na beist with him wald frequent,
Nor cum under his snair:
They dred so, and fled so,
From his society,
That nane their, his wane their
Wald support or supply.
The Basilique that beist maling,
Of Serpents quhilk is countit King,
Ran quhill he was the war,
Their was the Viper, and th'aspect,
With the serpent Cheliderect,
Quhois stink is felt a far:
Their was the serpent Cencrastus,
A beist of filthy braith,
And als the Serpent Cerastus,
Quhois byte brings sudden deith:
Their Vipers, and cripers, Latet anguis in herba.

amang the grene gars lay,
Down louring, and couring,
Quhill storm was went away.
The Fumart and the Fittret straue,
The deip and howest hole to have,
That was in all the wood,
About the try ruts their two ran,
Zit all in vain na thing they wan,
Bot did thole money thud*
For cauld they war discomfeist clean,
The schowrs were sa seueir,
Bot I who was ane pure Pilgren
And half ane stronimeir:
Forschew their, and knew their,
Sic tempest should betyde,
Than ran I, and wan I,
In ane hole me to hyde.
Out come the Quhitteret furthwith,
Ane littill beist of lim and lith,
And of ane sober schaip,
To have ane hole he had grit have,
Zit in the wood their was nane wast,
To harberie that iaip:
Than out that come the Modiwart,
Ane beist throw nature blind,
Quho fast the eirth culd scraip and scart,
Rest and refuge to find:
Quhiles dodling, and todling,
Upon fowr pretty feit,
Quhiles scrubbing, quhiles rubbing,
The ground quhair it was weit.
Their beists heir befoir nominat,
May esilie be numerat,
The calcull is bot small,
For by their beists I saw anew,
Quhois nams befoir I neuir knew,
Nor how men did them call:
Sick beists as I had seen before,
Their names I did reteene,
Bot their was money in that store,
That I had never seen:
Sum mikill, sum littill,
Of money syndrie sort,
That hantit, and plantit,
That place to be their port.
Sum proper were of portrature,
Of lith and lim, pretty and pure,
and hantsum to behald,
Quhois nams, I na wais culd expreme,
Nor to my judgment weill esteem,
The flox into that fald:
It was ane wonder for to se,
So great ane multitude,
Without all mediocritie,
Amangst the treis that stud:
Eschewing, the dewing,
Of ranie Orion,
That dropit, and knopit,
Both upon tree and stone.
Quhat farlie than thocht fouls that fleis,
With great pains and perplexiteis,
War grievously tormentit,
Quhen great wild beists, of lim and lith,
Imployd with pissance strenth and pith,
For feir, them selfis absentit*
And into hols and bors them hyd,
The storm for till eschew,
For quhy, the wind, with money quhyd,
May bitterly their blew:
With quhirling, and dirling,
The fudder fell so thick,
Down dryuing, and ryuing,
The leiues that they did lick.
First IOVIS foul, the Eagill fair,
I saw descend down from the air,
Syne to the wood went he,
The Hiron and the fleing Hairt,
Come fleing from ane other pairt,
beside him for to be:
Ane fellon tryne, com at his taill,
Fast flichtren throw the skise,
Bot suddenly, that scull did skaill,
Thairfore they war mair wise:
Than fled they, and sched they,
Every ane from ane vdder,
Down louching, and coutching,
To fle the flichts of fudder.
The fiery Dragon, flew on hie,
Out throw the skies, richt cuttetlie,
Syne to the ground come down,
Into ane fury fast he flew,
To have an hald, him to reskew,
As strangers to ane town:
Nixt come the Gorgoull and the Graip,
Two feirfull fouls indeid,
Quho vsis often to like and laip,
The blud of bodies deid:
Them druging, and ruging,
With their may cruel clukis,
Sik hashing, and knashing,
Cums not of clenlie cukis.
The Airne and the Goshalk syne,
That dentely had wont to dyne,
On Pairtrik and on Pliuer,
With feir, their famine was forzet,
With blasts of wind they war so bet,
And lancit throw the liver:
With the schairp speir of apetyte,
Howbeid, their hearts was perst
Yet they for meit, caird not ane myte,
Nor zit no succor cerst:
So fain than, vnslain than,
Thameselfs they wald have keipit,
That surely, may purelie,
Upon the ground they creipit.
Quhat should I say, the Gok, the Gled,
With speidie flycht, richt fast they fled,
From feding on the plain,
And their I saw the milk quhyte Swan,
Conuoy the Wodcock and the Cran,
Of quhome they war richt feign:
The Bisset and the Corbe both,
Flew fast befoir the laue,
Laith war they to kep any skaith,
Or any harm to have:
So slelie, and frelie,
From dangers they them fred,
In speiding, exceiding,
All vthers into tred.
The Houlet and the Herison,
Out of the airt Septentrion,
Come with ane feirfull voce,
The Houlet had sick awful cryis,
They corrospondit in the skyis,
As wind within a boce:
Quhois cryis and clamours terius,
I compair to the zell,
Of that great tike Cyberius,
The cruel hound of hell:
Quhois zouling, and gouling,
I have na will to heir,
Sick singing, and springing,
Is irksum to the eir.
The Arrondell so swift of flicht,
Down on the land richt law did licht,
So sore he was oprest,
The Alcions lykwais left the Sea,
And to the schore richt fast culd flee,
For to recover rest:
The Calicrat, that little thing,
Bot, and the honey Bie,
That wont before, to skip and spring,
Into the air so hie:
With mumming, and bumming,
The Be now seiks his byke,
Quhils stinging, quhils flinging,
From hole to hole did fyke.
The Cygonie, that foul so white,
Quhilk at the Serpents hes despyte,
Come granen to the ground,
And Mamuks, that byds ever mair,
And feids into the cristall air,
Deid on the feilds were found:
The Gru, before me their apeirs,
Quhois legs were lang and side,
From the Septentrion quhilk reteirs,
Into the winter tide:
This foul now, did zoull now,
As it had been ane beist,
Quhyls quhinging, quhyls cringing,
With pain it was so priest.
The Tuquheit and the Sterling than,
To gidder with the Pelican,
Flew in ane randell richt,
The Piet and the Papingo,
With the Goldspink I saw them go,
Syne laich they did down licht:
Behaulding their horrible things,
Almaist, my eis grew blind,
To se their pretty spirtlet wings,
So felterd with the wind:
Dispairit, I stairit,
Up to the element,
Behalding, their walding,
How they in ordour went.
The Merle and the Mauice trig,
Flew from the bush quher they did big,
Syne tuke them to the flicht,
The Osill and the Rosignell,
The Phoenix and the Nichtingell,
Two fouls both fair and bricht:
Quhois pretty wings I did persaue,
So spurtlit and so spread,
Their fouls, I couit feign to have,
So clerlie they war cled:
Their hew so, forth schew so,
To my two mortal eis,
That I their, stud by their,
Contempling to the treis.
The Stainzell, and the Schakerstane,
Behind the laue, war left alane,
With waiting on their marows,
The snype, with sundry other fouls,
With cairfull cries, laments and youls,
And specially pure Sparrows:
The meikill fouls war not to mean,
So meikill as the small,
Zit they did meikill to mentene,
Their bodies out of thrall:
Fast fallowing, with wallowing,
And money cairfull cry,
Intransit, I pansit,
Their panis for till espy.
The Hobbie and the Hedder bluter,
Aloud the Gaeto be their tuter,
Them to conduct and gyde,
The Cucko and the Couchet can,
The Lawrok and the littill wran,
Had sikker be their side:
And mairatour I tell to zow,
The Pown I did persaue,
Togidder with the turtill Dow,
The last of all the laue:
This fidder, togidder,
Unto the wood ar went:
Sum murning, and turning,
Into the firmament.
Of ilk particular foul to treit,
It war ouir tedious to repeit,
Quhair fore I thocht it best,
In this cathaloge to conuene
Ane bonie number, bot I mean,
Renouncing all the rest:
Bot as I spak to zow before,
Tuitching the multitude,
I wat their was ten thousand score
Of birds and beists may brude:
To ken tham, or pen tham,
My wit it was to waik,
Or zit their, to sit their,
On sik consaits to glaik.
I was afflixit in my mind,
And als with caris I was inclynd,
To be in sick a stait,
I hapnit in ane wilderness,
Quhair I chanst to gang in beges,
Be ganging out the gait:
Vainly and temerariuslie,
Into that pairt I past,
Bot he that wald feign fairles sie,
Sall find them at the last:
Belyue syne, aryue syne,
Within the wood did I,
Quhair I ay, did spy ay,
Wyld beists fast rynning by.
Fra time I enterd in that pairt,
I saw na passage to depairt,
Nor entry to win out,
To heir the Wildbeists bray and beir,
My febill flesh, did faint for feir,
Na takin I was stout:
God wat, gif I was in great pain,
I wist not quhair to ryn,
Nor zit culd find the gait again,
First, quhair I enterd in:
Bot tauren, and dauren,
Like ane daft doitit fule,
Afflikit, and prickit,
With dairts of cair and dule.
How culd I be, bot full of cair,
And halflings put into despair,
So to be left alone,
Quhair I with na man micht confar,
Nor zit within ten myls we nar,
Till any town or waine
The tempest did continue still,
Their was both weit and wynd,
And EVRVS with loud schouts and schill,
His braith begoud to find:
With quhewing, renewing,
His bitter blaists again,
Seueirly, not sneirly,
To you, I make it plain.
The wadder was not like to mend,
Nor zit, to draw to any end,
Quhair throw it micht be fair,
Bot ay the Tempest did acres,
And na ways lykin to grow les,
Bot rather to be mair.
The Wyldbeists crap down quietly,
The wedder was so rud,
For they micht have no faculty,
To pas and seik their fud:
The tall beists, the small beists,
Did eit and slae thairfore,
The meikill fouls, the litill fouls,
In lykwais did deuore.
The rich, the pureons ay oprest,
I mean the meikillest, ay the lest,
Dulfullie did down thring,
Without all pity or respect,
Of the inferiors threw the nek,
Quhilk was ane cruel thing:
Gif any persoun may profane,
Wald call sick slauchter syne,
It may be answert heir agane,
Neid nakit man gars ryne:
Great neid than, indeid than,
Compeld them so to do,
Or else their, them selfs their,
For till have perished to.
They culd not do na les indeid,
Seeing that their was na remeid,
Bot either do or die:
Gif vtherwayis they micht have done,
They had run forth and socht it sone,
Bot so it micht not bie:
Their hearts with hunger was so peirst,
That they behou'd have fude,
For this cause they both socht and serst,
How they micht have their blude:
Begyling, and syling,
The eyes of silly beists,
Them taking, and making,
Provision for their feists.
The litill beists maid hauie mane,
With the grit beists to be oretane,
And so to be destroyed,
Their murning micht them na thing mend
Bot only their to make ane end,
Of that quhilk they enjoyed:
Within that Wilderness desert,
their was grit number slane,
The wyld foulis on the other part,
Did play the counterpane:
Abusing, and using,
The small fouls at their will,
But treitie, or pity,
Not sparing it to spill.
Sum fled for feir to save them sels,
And other sum with zouts and zels,
May cairfully did cry,
Gif they had cause our selfis may judge,
Seeing that their was na refuge,
How that they micht win by:
Bot as the foular casts his cair,
His catch for to prevent,
So they war trapit in the snair,
Into ane accident:
Still wating, and gating,
Quhyll they war all oretane,
Dispaching, and knashing,
In ordour, ane and ane.
Than struke ane terror in my mind,
For to persaue, their pure beists pynd,
Quhilk micht make na debait,
Great broucherie and bludshed maid,
About the pairt, quhair I abaid,
Sick was their woeful stait:
Astonished I stud, trymbling their,
Forfant, for very feir,
And as the silly huntit hair,
From ratchis maks reteir:
Quhylis rising, quhylis vysing,
Quhylis saying to my sell,
My stait now, and gait now,
apeirs to pas to hell.
I thocht I ay descendit down,
And so for feir, I fell a soun,
But moving sens or sicht,
For feir, and quhat for laik of fude,
My body empty was of blude:
In me their was na micht:
My spreit perturbit was so fair,
With vysions and with dreims,
That I lay comfortles in cair,
In troubils and extreims:
Quhylis demyng, quylis dremyng,
I lay into ane trance,
Quhylis panyng. quhylis vanyng,
So sudden was my chance.
My febill corpse, did faint richt soune,
For I saw neither sun nor moune,
No planets did apeir,
Quhat stakren stait, was this to me,
To be in sick obscurity,
Gif this was pain I speir:
Than softly did I suoufe and sleipe,
Howbeid my bed was hard,
Into ane den profound and deipe,
Quhair I with nane was scard:
Radoting, starnoting,
As weary men will do,
Supyring, quhiles wyring,
My tender body to.
FINIS.
Heir ends the first Passage of the Pilgrimer.
BE HONOR I LEVE.
THE SECOVND PASSAGE OF THE PILGRIMER.
FIrst in my visioun I saw,
Montains and Muris, orecled with snaw,
And all the bewis maid bair,
And fine I thocht, I saw great Seis,
Quhois michtie force, NEPTVN dois meis,
As Dominator their:
The Island EGEOS, I did se,
NEPTVNVS hallowit hill,
Quhilk stands into the Grecian Se,
Quhair sluds dois flow and fill:
Beside their, may wide their,
Mount Locas micht be seen,
With SCILLIA, and DOSINA,
Quhair grows the marbell green.
Erix that monstrus mountain hie,
Quhois hauture hes na quantity,
As Poets dois report,
This michtie mountain, micht be seen,
Quhairon their stands, ane Temple scheene,
Weill buildit their athort:
This Tempill did the Trojans found,
To VENUS, as we read,
The stains thairof war marbell sound,
Like to the Lamer bead:
This muldrie, and buldrie,
Was may magnificall,
May royal, and ioyall,
Trim and pontifical.
Quhair I sat musing mine alone,
OLympus mont of Macedone,
I thocht stud me before,
Mont Emus, their apeird to me,
Quhair ORPHEUS leird his harmony,
And melodiuell lore:
I saw the river Tagus to,
Quhair goldin sands did schyne,
Quhair that the Nymphs hes ay ado,
With all the Musis nine:
As NERIDES, and DRIADES,
Two Nymphs, of great renoun,
With CLEO, and CRATO,
Till Helicone were boun.
The Rochis repercust and rang,
Quhair that the Tritons played and sang,
On trumpis tresexcellent,
Their PAN played on his pleasant pype,
And ORPHEUS on his Harp sicklike,
Ane pretty instrument:
That sound was so celestial,
And so melodius,
Above all things terrestrial,
The may iucundius:
May sweitest, and meitest,
For weary men like me,
Quhois noying to ioying,
Was changit suddenly.
Sick mirthfull menstrellie was their,
I wait that never man saw mair,
Into so schort a space,
I musit, and I merueld syne,
To se that hie triumphant tryne,
Of peopill in that place:
Than curiously I did inquire,
At ane quho stud me by,
Quho Prences was, or had impire,
Of that may fralik f^y:
A maid than, me said than,
I sall you tell bedeene,
Our maistres, and gods,
VENUS that lusty Queen.
Quhair boun ye to my friend, sche sais,
Astonishtly me think ye gais,
Tell me quhat mouis your mind,
Gif ze gang wrang, I sall you gyde,
Apearandly thou wanderst wide,
I se weill be your synd:
For this place is may perrillus,
And dangerous indeid,
And their mountains are maruellus,
Quhair all Wyldbeists dois breid:
May terribill, and horribill,
Is this wanhappy gait,
Sick dangers, puts strangers,
Into ane stakren stait.
Gif thou go fordward, thou sall se,
Neritos with his rochis hie,
Quhair Giants hes their hyuis
Their rochis thou sall se anew,
Quhair HERCULES the lion slew,
As VIRGIL weill descryuis:
Into their pairts, their nane repairs,
Except it be our sels,
For heir belangs, our haill affairs,
As I have tauld the else:
Bot we than, ye se than,
Nane may make hanting heir,
Unless now, expres now,
To daith they wald apeir.
Heir is the pairt thou may espy,
Quhair CACVS, in his cave dois ly,
That monster may seueir,
Vpoun his zet deid heidis ar hung,
Of agit folk, and children young,
Quho had been walken heir:
This CACVS, lyis not heir alon,
Bot money Giants mea,
The offspring zit of GERION
Quhome HERCULES did flea,
Pocessis, and dressis,
Their placis as they pleis,
Tormenting, and shenting,
Men's blud of all degreis,
I can not tell quhat thou sall do,
Bot take good tent, quhair thou gangs to,
The danger dois draw neir,
The Giants heir are conuocat,
Agains pure pepill to combat,
Quho hapins to cum heir:
Euin as the blyndman gangs beges,
In houering far behynd,
So dois thou dandill in distres,
Quhilk I feir thou sall find:
Bewar now, ore far now,
To pas into this place,
Consydring, quhat fydring,
Lyis in your gait alace.
As hills humectat are with dew,
AVRORAS teirs for to renew,
Quhilk TYTAN dois distell,
With sackles blud, quhilk heir is shed,
So are their placis haill orespred,
Lamentabill to tell:
Ane pepill may hyronius,
Rustik, ignare* and rud,
And na ways Elimosmus,
Bot buriours in blud:
All hours ay, in bours ay,
Exspecting for thait pray,
With gredur, but dredur,
Awaiting in the way.
I wish to God, gif thou were than,
Transformd in portrait of a Swan,
As JOVE did quhen he dred,
With fedret wings to fle on hie,
So that thou micht in safety be,
And from all dangers fred:
Gif that thou culd discryue the cairt,
The way thou wald go richt,
Or silver DIAN, do depairt,
The regent of the nicht,
To fle syne, on he syne,
Out throw the cluddie air,
As bounting, up mounting,
Above the feilds so fair.
Their catif miscreants, I mean,
As buriours hes ever been,
Wordie to vilipend,
The practice of their pariceid,
And barbrus cruel homiceid,
Is not till us unkind:
Quhairfore my friend, it is my will,
Sum vtherway ye wynd,
For execrabill cursed and ill,
Their catifs are of kind:
Surprysing, and vysing,
Pure Pilgrims how to trap,
Still lurking, in wurking,
Sum matter of mishap.
At lenth, this Pilgrim spoke again,
Except with me, that ye remain,
For feir my corpse will cule,
Swa feiring, their for to be left,
He of his senses was bereft,
Besottit like ane fule:
MACROBIVS QYNTVS of Corinth,
Quho did descend to hell,
In ane mair troublus Laborinth,
Not intricat him sell:
Nor I now, quhair by now,
Experience teichis plain,
Intrusit, and vsit,
With pepill may profane.
Before I come into this cair,
Perplexity and great despair,
With troubill; strife and tene,
Wald I had been deuord with daith,
Else in the entrels of the earth,
Intombit till have been:
Och ATRAPVS, quhair is thy knyfe,
Quhy hes thou me misusd,
Into relenting of my life,
Quhilk hes been so abusd:
Wald God now, the rod now,
Of daith, wald me deuore,
That deing, my being,
Micht heir remain no more.
Better I never had been borne,
Nor live in sic a life forlorn,
Byrning in flams of fire,
My dolor daily aggrauats.
And cairs so me inuironats,
That deith I do desire:
Quhen I relat my life alace,
My watrie eyes distels,
Considdring my may cairfull case,
All plesours that expels:
O deid now, with speid now,
Cum peirs me with thy dairt,
I griue heir, to live heir,
Sen ans I must depairt.
Seeing na ischew till eschew,
My dolor daily did renew,
Sic madness did me move,
Euin as ane persoun in despair,
My grief aggregis mair and mair,
Without remorse or roue.
Then I begoud to exclamat,
The Gods into my grief,
And quhyls APOLLO imprecat,
To send me sum releif:
Howbeid than, in neid than,
I at their Gods socht grace,
In vain zit, my pain zit,
Gat na relief alace.
APOLLO had compleit his cure,
And so the clouds were all obscure,
For PHAEBVS cast no licht,
AVRORA raise with sanguine hew,
And so DIANA bad adieu,
The Regent of the nicht:
With this begoud to cleir the skyse,
Amangs the mountains, great and grim,
I socht this Gods gay:
Quhair I mont Caucasis did clym,
Quhair snaw remains for ay:
Dispairdly, vncairdly,
I hasert over the hill,
Allowing, and trowing,
To have obteind my will.
Great was the hasert, quhilk I tuke,
Gif to the voyage, ye wald luke,
And all the perils pen,
Amang sick monstrous animals,
I mean the cruel canibals,
Quha feids on flesch of men:
Their barbrus pepill, war nor Moirs,
Their JOVE, dois not extol,
Bot sum the Daelphin torche adoirs,
And sum the artik poll:
Securely, vnsurely,
Still sleping into syn,
Offending, but mending,
Sick is the race they ryn.
Than did I dascan with my sell,
Quhidder to heuin or unto hell,
Their persouns should pertene,
Quho na wais hes regard of God,
Bot as wyld beists, dois ryn abrod,
Delyting into tene:
I in my mind again did pance,
How all was done in sleuth,
In blindness and in ignorance,
But knawledge of the truth:
Deploring, and soring,
Their ignorant estaits,
Quhilk marknes, and darkness,
Pairtlie their deids debaits.
Than judge, quhat dois to sick belang,
As knawis the richt way be the wrang,
And zit the same forbeirs,
Or can we call them christians richt,
That seis the glorious glancing licht,
Syne to the mirke reteirs:
Sum are like lions in effect,
Both barbarus and rud,
And sum like woluis, without respect,
Seking their nichbours blud:
Sick men than, ye ken than,
Amangs our selfs we se,
As bregers, and tigers,
Delyts in blud to be.
Ze that your lands delapidats,
And all your actions agitats,
In sick profane affairs,
Ze Bludsheders and buriours all, homo homini Lupus

Just Canibals, men may you call,
As weill your deids declairs:
Thou bluddy man that dois abuse,
Thy glore bot, and thy grace,
Quhat can thou find for thy excuse,
At the tribunal place:
Thy scusis, and rusis,
Sall serve for na effect,
Bot rather, sall further,
Thy knaifre to detect.
Into that terribill conflict,
Sick ferifull pains my heart did prick,
As na man micht abide,
Their wandering in the corners cauld,
My Nymph, I na wais culd behauld,
Amangs the mountains wyd:
Feir pat my heart in sick a flocht,
It did me mutch mischief,
And ay the mair of her I thocht,
The greter grew my grief:
Quhyls wissing, her missing,
Out of my mind to go,
Yet sadness, and madness,
Did agrauat my woe.
The mair ye stop the stream within,
With gretter force the flud will ryn,
As I may weill compair,
Sick fantasy on her I set,
The fainer I wald her forzet,
Remembrie grew the mair:
O Nymph, quod I, now to me tell,
Quhy hes thou done this deid,
Into absenting of thy sell,
Fra me in gretest neid:
Draw neir me, and heir me,
Pure catife quhair I cry,
Beseiking, with speiking,
Sum answer to reply.
Euin as the fish dois take delight,
Upon the fishers bait to byte,
Put thairupon expres,
Euin so perchance, I seik the thing,
Quhilk may redound to my maling,
Destruction and distres:
Quhyls luking comfort to resaue,
Quhyls luking for a skelp,
Quhyls dreiding sche should me disaue,
Quhyls houping for her help:
Perplexit, and vexit,
Betwixt hope and despair,
Quhyls transing, quhyls pansing,
How till eschew the snair.
My spreit supirs and sichs may sair,
Quhen I rement me ever mair,
How godles men begins,
For till associat them fels,
With sick as piety repels,
And dois delight in sins:
Gif in your counsals, ye conclud,
Far placis for to se,
Ken weill, your company be good,
So sall ye happy be:
Great sorrows, and thorrows,
Ill company procuris,
Forese than, with me than,
This troubill that induris.
Incace men wald record in mind,
Quhat hes been wrackit and reuynd,
By siclike menis alace,
Or gif they wald in mind incall,
The saying Salamonicall,
Concerning sick a case:
Or zit the danger vnderstud,
Or culd the perrils ken,
Ill company they wald seclud,
And hant with honest men:
Atend ye, and mend ye,
That loups before ye luke,
In venture, ye enter,
Quhair ye resaue rebuke.
Intill astonishment I stud,
For I na outgait vnderstud,
My mind was so resolved,
And in my mind oftimes did think,
How till elaps, from this precink,
Quhairin I was inuolued:
Quhyls lipning comfort to consaue,
Quhyls lipning ill alace,
In heart and mind, ye may persaue,
No sympathy hes place:
Quhylis dowting, quhylis showting,
That sche my voce micht heir,
In haist now, this gaist now,
Before me did apeir.
In monstrus manner, sche come their,
As CRVSA did, that dame so fair,
After sche was deceist,
The gifts quhilk did her corpse decore,
And form, quhairin sche was before,
Is alterd in a beist:
Can this be thou, that stands me by,
Into ane beists estait,
Sche answers me, this same is I,
That gydit thee the gait:
Perhap now, my chap now,
Will make the for to feir,
Bot dreid not, thou neid not,
Na danger sall the deir.
Than did I cry with loud alace,
Quhair is thy fair and fragrant face,
With thy gold glitring hair,
Quhair are thy cumly crystal eis,
And coral lips, beneth thy breis,
With body debonair:
Thy cumly corpse, from end to end,
So clenly was inclosd,
That MOMVS nocht culd discommend,
So weill thou was composd:
Thy trymnes, and nymnes,
Is turned to vyld estait,
Thy grace to* and face to,
Is alterd of the lait.
I at this spreit, begoud to speir,
Quhilk in my presence did apeir,
Desiring it to tell,
Gif it that power, had of God,
Quho in his richt hand halds the rod,
Or of the devil in hell:
The pairt of PROTHEVS, thou dois play,
Quho quhyli was changst in mist,
And culd transform him self I say,
In any schape he list:
Are ye than, as he than,
Declair the truth to me,
Or TYSEPHON, or MAGERON,
Ane of the furies three.
Or art thou cumd of Phocames,
Or of the monster Odites,
By MOPSIS, schot to deid*
Or art thou of Euriplis town,
Quhair wyfis wairs horns upon their croun,
As Oxin on their heid:
Or dwells thou in the Horison,
Above all earthly bounds,
Or in the mount of Cocheron,
Quhair echo ay resounds:
In Achyron, or Flagiton,
Thois two infernal fluds,
Repairs thou, or fairs thou,
With Diabolyk bruds.
Or come thou from dame THETIS lap,
Quhair stout ACHIL resau'd his schap,
As ancient Poets pens,
Or com thou from NEPTVNS field,
Quhair TITAN nichtlie hes his beild,
As common pepill kens:
Quhair PHALEMON repairs expres,
The son of IVNO Queen,
With auld COLANTVS hes exces,
NEPTVNVS courtiours kene:
Remane ye, or trane ye,
On see so far of schore,
Or use ye, or muse ye,
With them reherst before.
Thocht strange this purpos will apeir,
That mortal men demand or speir,
At spreits that be unclean,
Lat na man marvel in his mind,
For God that al things hes inclynd,
Permits their things I mean:
He is the Lord of Sea, and land,
Quha dantons all indeid,
And hes the bridle in his hand,
Quhilk halds them by the heid:
Comanding, their standing,
Their actions, and exces,
His richt now, and micht now,
Comands them more and les.
Nor marvel not, thocht I demand,
The verity til understand,
Concerning spreits that be,
How sum are hingand in the air,
Sum in the earth and fields so fair,
And sum into the Sea:
This Royal King of all renoun,
Knawis quhat he hes ado,
For quhen that LVCIFER fell down,
Their spreits descendit to:
Thy glore now, the more now,
Is kend o potent God,
In schawing, and blawing,
Thy potent power abrod.
Concerning spreits, quhair of I spoke,
Sum lyis into the Limbo lake,
Perplexit with woe and pane,
Sum lyis belaw, and sum above,
This is na paradox I prove,
The matter is may plane:
O thou great God, our only scheild,
In quhome we do rejose,
Conduct us to ELISIAN field,
Quhair good spreits dois repose:
That we ay, may be ay,
Conductit be thy grace,
In pureness, and surenes,
In Heuin to have our place.
FINIS.
BE HONOR I LEVE.
