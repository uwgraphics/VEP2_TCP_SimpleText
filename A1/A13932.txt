A treatise declaryng and shewi^g diverse causes taken out of the holy
scriptures / of the sentences of holy faders, and of the decrees of devout
Emperors, that pyctures and other images which were wont to be worshypped / ar
i^ no wise to be suffered in the temples or churches of Christen men. By the
which treatise the reder that is indifferent, shall se and perceive, how good
and godly a deed it was of the Senatoures of Arge^tine, that of late days they
caused all the images with their auters to be clean taken out of their
churches.

The authors of this little treatise ar the open preachers of Argte^yne.

I dout not but some popish doctor or peuish proctor will grunt at this treatise
/ but yet first read and than judge.

The preface.
All the whole company of them which at Argentyne do preach and teach Christ
/ unto the good and godly reders do wysshe grace.
Because our most noble and also most godly Senators did right well perceive
and se / yt the sclaunderouse occasyo^s and manyfold euyls / which hitherto
have be^ ministered by ye reason of pictures and images / ar not suffyciently
taken away by the only exhortacions of prechers. And again did consider / that
it was not possible for any man to decree or command any thing concerning
them more wisely / than god had prescrybed and commanded in his law and
prophets: They decreed / ordained / and gave forth a commandment / that
whatsoever pycture or images had been wont to be worshipped in holy places
should both they and their aulters be clean taken away / and avoided out of
sight. Every pla^tatio^ that my heuenlye father has not planted / shall be
extirped and plucked up by the root. mat. 15
Because.iiii. years ago they had abrogated and taken away private masses: And
a year ago four common and open masses / for first consolatyon and
delyberatyon of more pure ceremonies to be brought in to their places.

where shall Monks ^ freers / chanons / no^nes / heremites / and recluses
become?
Secondarily they lokyng for certain counsels and assembles / of which it was
hoped / that some what should be decreed concerning the general reformation of
ye church. And thyrdly the wekenesse of certain persons / which could not
yet se / how great abusyon / impiety and wickedness is in masses / had saved
the resydewe of masses. and they had suspended the^ upon this condition / that
if any man could prove by the scryptures / that they were not contrary to
Christ / they should be restored again euerione. Moreover seeing yt there be
many men / which do not yet perceive nor know / how much these things do
hinder faith and true godly living: we do easily conjecture that there be not
a few / which shall account this deed of our common well / to be a
folysshe and wicked presumptyon. And therefore / for as much as it is the duty
of all christen men / as much as in them lies / to give dilygence and to
provide / that the thing which they have godly done and wrought / may be
accounted and known of other men / to be none other wise than godly done. And
also to take good head / that no man may have occasyon worthily to speak evil
of their goodness (as Paul says)

Herfore we have judged it to be our part and duty which taught that the
thing ought to be done which now our senate has done in very deed / and
brought to pass very dilygently to show the cause of all this whole deed: but
with as much brefenesse as may be / that if it would be / we might happily
pacify and appese the minds / at the lest wise of some persons / whom this
business has troubled and greatly discontented / and doubtless / if we may
optaine this one thing (which is denied to no man / be he never so great a
malefactor) that we may have the one ear open to here what we shall say: We
fear not / but that whosoever can find in their hertes / and abide to know
these few things / which we shall allege first out of holy scriptures /
secondarilye of the writings of the fathers: And thyrdly of the decrees of
emperors against pyctures and images. If it be showed also of whom / and for
what cause and consyderation both they were first brought up in the churches of
christen men / and also being defended have continued in the same. We doubt not
(I say) but that all such persons / if it be so / that it be granted unto
them to know the truth / will also desire with us / that this thing which
is done here with us / all other churches of christen me^ / would follow and
execute in like manner. Therefore we pray and beseech all those / whosoever ca^
not yet like nor a low this our example (which thing it is no merueyle
though it happen to many men / if a man consydre which things have euerywhere
gotten strength among Christen men) that they will vouchesafe to read this
short and little treatise to the end and intent / which first was made in
our maternall tongue / and than by our most well-beloved brother James Bedrote
/ was translated into Laten / and now at the last in to English. But let
the^ first before they begin to read / call for the spirit of Christ /
which only ledeth into all veryte and truth and that done / let them than
give sentence of us: Io. 16.
Christ the savior of mankind / grant to all those which bear his name /
grace to reiecte and cast away all such things / which do alyenate and call
away the mind from him / that they may lift up their minds unto him /
sitting in heaven and worship the father by him in spirit and truth. Io. 4.
Amen.

That images nor pictures which have been wont to be worshipped ar not to be
suffered in the churches of Christen men.
ALbeit / there are very mani just causes which might suffycyently satisfy
the minds of christen me^ / and persuade them to take away images out of
their churches: yet no man will deny this cause to be without dout chief and
princypall / because it is forbidden in the first of gods commandments /
that any manner of images should be had among his people. For thus we read in
the scripture: Ex. 20
I am that everlasting god. I am thy god which have delivered the from Egypt /
the house of thraldom and bondage. Thou shall have no strange gods in my
sight. Thou shall make unto thy self no graven or karuen image / nor the
symylytude of any manner thing which is above in heaven or beneth in the earth:
nor of those things which are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not
bow thy self before them / nether worship them: for I am thy lord god
everlasting / strong and mighty / punysshinge the fautes of the fathers in the
children / even unto the third generatyon of the^ which do hate me. and
powringe forth my goodness / even unto the thousanth generation of them which
do love me / and do observe and keep my commandments. Lo / here are.ii.
laws of the lord set forth unto the which not without good cause among
other / do challenge unto them selves the first place. the first commandment.
The first of them requires of us / that we do take this eternal and ever
being god (so as he is in very deed) for our god. The.ii. commandment.
The later does not only forbid strange gods / but also it forbyddeth both
the images of them and also of all other things / to be had among the
people of god / unto which people doutlesse / that is to wit unto all true
beleuers / all such manner precepts do appertain. For these ar the true
Israelyties / as it appears in the scryptures. Rom 2 iiii.ix. Gala. 3 iiij.
Mat. ^
For Christ came not to break the law: but to fulfill it first of any man.
Now in very deed they are annexed to the law of god / and also enclosed and
contained in it / whatsoever things do bri^ge any cause or occasyon unto the
love of god or of the neighbor / to show or put forth it self more and more.

In deed god commanded very many things to his old people which were
greatly aueylable and helping to the princypall point and end of his law.
But after that christ was ones exalted to the right hand of his father / and
the holy ghost was sent all abroad into the world / we are delivered and free
from a great perte of such manner ceremonies of the law of Moses. Deu 7
As for example it was gods will and commau^deme^t / that ye iues should live
together by themselves / abstainyng from co^panye^g and dealyng with the ge^tyles
(for he did not yet vouchsafe that ye gentyles should have knowledge of his
doctrine) to the intent no dout of it / The ge^tyls were not than called to the
faith
yt they should by so much be the more obedyent to his commandment / by how
much they were the less corrupted and infected with the company of the gentyles
/ worshippi^ge false gods. As swalo^ hedge dyuidi^g two gardens or houses
broken down makes of twain one / so did the taking away of the ceremonies
by Christ's death makethe Jews and us al one church. Colo. 2
But after yt the wall of ye heavy burden of so many rites and ceremonies of the
Iues (which not only deperted ye one people from the other / but also made the^
enemies) was throwe^ down. ephesians. 2 and both the gentiles and also the iues grew
together into one people. This law which forfe^ded the Israelytes / companye^g
with ye ge^tyls could do no service nor profet at all. Wherefore it was
conuenye^t that ye said law should be abrogated and taken away. such another
like thing is circumcision / and also the rytes and ceremonies of
purifycations / the choice of metes / the diuersyteis of places and persons:
and whatsoever besides these is red to have be^ commanded in the old law /
concerning outward sacrifyces. For these things in as much as neither faith
nor charytie does now require them: it shall be lawful and free for us either
to observe and keep them / or else to leave them undone. For the true honor
and worshippynge of god / which has been by the preaching of the apostels
indifferently publysshed to the whole world / will in no wise suffer it self
to be thruste so narowly in to such manner streyghtes of places / days /
meats / and persons.

Images ar forbede^ by the second commandment.
But as concerning images / the thing is far otherwise: For these being
ones forbidden must needs stand always still forbidden / specially for this
cause. Because the true honoring of god can not be / but either minisshed or
else diverse ways let: as soon as we shall suffer the said images /
contrary to the commandment of god in churches / or in other places / where
they be honored or else may be honored. Faith is the most substanciall and
perfet honor of god. To. 4.
For substancyall and parfeyt faith / and the parfeyt honoring of god /
requires that we should do our dilyge^ce to cause this only god to be known
in all places / that we should dread and honor him: that we should in all
places and at all times with full mouth / praise and magnify the works of him
alone. So may we worship non other but god alone. mat. 4. Deu. 6 10.
But images ar so far from helping unto this thing / that the same do
diverse ways hyndre and let every man from the true honoring of god. For who
is he (I beseech you) whom images set up in churches / or in other more narowe
places / have not rather made neglygent about the true honoring of god / than
helped him any whyt to honor god trewly. Ye / moreover (if it be lawful to
speak the truth) the true honor of god being subverted and overthrown / they
have quite blotted out of men's minds the remembrance of those things / for
whose cause it is feigned / that they were first set up. and though it be so
that otherwhiles peraue^ture by the occasyo^ of these goodly gay admonytours /
some slypper thought and tra^sytory remembrance of god does come suddenly i^ to
our mind: Dead Images are but dombe teachers and can teach us no lively ne
yet fruteful knolege of god
yet ye same thought is sooner vanysshed away / tha^ that it can gader
sufficient rotes i^ the breasts or minds of me^: for as it is but a thing of
man's deuysyng / and received without the commandment of god: eue^ so was it
never able to move or stere our hertes and minds with the quick and lively
perceyuyng / either of ye works or of ye benefytes of god. If the lively
spirit of god / does teach us al things by his word what is than let to be
taught us by dombe Images
By ye reason of which thing it has come to pass / yt no place has be^ left
to the lively admonition / which is by ye creatures of god: natwtsta^ding yt
these said creatures / because in all places we do se them and handle the^ /
ought also in all places to styre up and renew in us the remembrance of gods
infynyte goodness. Briefly there is no cause / why we may more rightfully and
justly impute (shall I say negligence / or else our own contempt toward the
true honor which is acceptable to god) unto any other thing than unto images.
Images have stolen away gods glory from him and taught us to neglecte and
conte^pne him.
For after that these began to be worshipped i^ certain places forthwith
flowed an unmeasurable see of all euyls: for though we pasouer / that god by
reason hereof / was many ways grievously offended and displeased / because the
contrary to his open and euydent commandment not only we have worshipped
the^: but also puttyng our trust in such manner worshippi^g / have persuaded
unto ourselves / that herwt we do wyn to ourselves the favor of god and
trustyng unto these vain and tryflynge works / have either utterly not minded
/ or at the lest wise have lothsomly and disdaynefully done those works / with
which only a christen mind may be pleasynge and acceptable to god. and who is
he but he knows that by the reason hereof / very many men have been so tyckled
with a meruelouse vain hope / to get of the lord I wot not what great hepes
and tresures of merytes: that if they had not thought these manner tryfles to be
most acceptable to god. Pitho the goddess of eloquence
No / not ye gods Pitho herself / with all her sweet eloquence / should have be^
able to have brought the^ in mind / being slow enough: yea / and to much unto
all other works of charity besides / to have pleasure to lasshe out so great
richesse / partly upon the making and partly upon the payntynge / gyldynge / or
otherwise garnysshynge and deckynge of images. Besides all this I say (which is
a thing more to be sorowed for) this vain honoring of images has engendered
such a confydence and trust in a great sort of men / Images have given us a
licentius liberty to all ungodliness
that those works which are in very deed good and godly / laid clean aside:
they have taken occasyon to live a great dele the more at large and more
lycencyously / because they are persuaded and in steadfast belefe / that with
these works they have so gotten the favor of god / that at all other sins
and vycyouse living / he does wynke and will not se them / and as though
having liberty granted to sin unpunished / they might give themselves at
large to all manner vices / even as they list themselves. If this thing were
not well enough known unto all men by experyence: we could prove it with such
manifest examples and proufes / that even he that were blind should perceive
plainly / that there has not lyghtely any other more perilouse mischefe cropen
in to the church / tha^ this of honourynge images.

Who is he tha^ that does not here somewhat smell and perceive the false wyly
crafts of our old enemy / The craftye suggestio^ of the devil brought in
Images to depue god of his honor,
which has never cessed to drive ye world unto such madness / that puttyng
away the true honor of god / men should rereyue and embrace this honor / which
makes the^ to go the clean contrary way from god disceyuyng all manner me^
with the vain appearance and outward sight of images / as though (god wot) men
by the^ were put in remembrance of godly things / wha^ in very deed by the^
nothi^ge else has be^ brought in / but an innumerable hepe of all euyls.
Moreover / that man who^ heaven / earth / and whatsoever is contained in them /
and most specially man which is created to the image of god: finally who^ god
hi^ self / the worker of al these things / does not wake^ and stire up to
love hi^ and praise him: Let the beholdi^g of the lively creatures / in who^
the goodness of god so shines and is represented excite and stir thy mi^de to
god / rather than the dombe images
No man / oules he be madder tha^ a man of Bedlem / will believe that this man
wylbe moved greatly with deed and vnsensyble images / if so many works of god /
if so many creatures / no les profitable tha^ meruelouse / which set the
goodness of god before thine eyes / can not inflame the / thou art doutles to
vnse^syble for to be admonysshed and styred ever of vnse^syble images. For wha^
he which is only good had all things, he allowed the^ al to be good.
the goodness of god shyneth and apperith in all his creatures, There is
nothi^ge but it expresses god himself. All the world is full of things
which do not cesse to put us in remembrance of our duty: that is to wit / that
we should continue to be unto other me^ as god is unto us / and that we should
resemble hi^ by a certain endless goodness. But verily that this thing has
the less easily ben brought to pass hitherto / we may thank images for a
great perte thereof for such expenses which ought to have been made upon poor
nedy folk (who^ as being the very lively images of god / it was conuenyent to
have socoured and made our friends with our lyberalitie) we have wastfully
bestowed upon stocks and stones. ye see therefore that the true honor / and
that which only is accepted to god / has been by none other thing so much
backed and hi^dred as it has by the vain superstition of images: and that the
devil by these crafts has brought i^ the conte^pte of god / the ouerthrowi^g
of faith / a more large liberty to do whatsoever me list unpunished / false
co^fydence in merytes / lothfulnesse to exercise charity toward our neybours:
brefly an exceeding great hepe of all manner euyls has been brought in: and to
make an end / a wyndowe opened to all manner vice and sin: which thing
although it might be esely proved by examples out of no^bre: For the
worshypping and sufferi^ge the images to stand / were so many ungodly kings
noted and repreued.

And for the destroyeng of images were some kings so hyghlye co^me^ded


yet at this present time let one example of the kings of Israel suffyce. For
how many soever of these kings thistorie of the Bible does nombre among so
many wicked and ungodly persons / the same kings it does record to have be^
also idolaters and worshippers of images: on ye other side again / whosoever
ar commended for their love and exercise of virtue and godlynes they would give
euydent testimonye and witness by distroyeng and rydding images shortly out of
the way / that they were ruled by the holy ghost / and could not but hate all
manner things which are abhomynable in the sight of god.

The books of the heavenly word of god have been burnt, and blind images have
be^ set up in their stead / but now we trust our bright books shall be restored
to us and their bli^de books shall be brent.
And as for that which some men do feign that images ar the books of lay men
(for so they say) it is not only a weke reason / but also a folish as who should
say that god / of all most wysest / and which is very wysdom it self / either
did not know these books / or else through malice did witholde from his own
people such manner books and monumentes / whereby they might be put in
remembrance of godly things. Forsooth it is a wicked thing / eue^ ones to
think that god (which according to his goodness toward us / left none of
these things vnshewed: and as they say / poynted with his finger which might
help to further and increase ye knowledge of himself / and to stire us up also
to the love of himself. I can not tell of what evil will and hatred had kept
this worshippi^g of images from his own people. For not only he did not tech
the worshippynge of images / but also he did with express and plain words
utterly forbede it: as it apperith euydently by the first table of ye law. Now
what is more unreasonable and vnlykly tha^ if the use of images be so profitable
as these men do feign it to be / that god did nothing esteem the^: seeing that
in the mean season he had begone to tech his people / being yet but young
begi^ners / having but small knowledge with so many outward things / eue^ as one
should enduce a child: Seeing also that he would his works and benefytes to be
openly known by so many wonderful miracles / and by so manyfold ceremonies.
Besides this did enduce the people with holidays Holy days mo than be
necessary
/ and other rytes innumerable, Finally he left nothing behind to the
shadowynge and fyguryng of himself largely unto them. How fortuned it (I say)
if images be so profitable that god for all this insomoche did nothing esteem
the^ / yt he would in no wise suffer the^ to be among his people. Since than it
is so / that it was not lawful for the people which was yet rude and ignorant
to have any manner images / although ye lord did by many other diverse ceremonies
by little and little teache and facyo^ the same people. How much less shall it
be laufull for us / who^ (the truth now succeeded and followed in ye place of
shadows) has now made free from outward ceremonies requyrynge none other
honor or service of us / than that which stands in spirit and truth.

Let us therefore have images / not of stone / not of wood / not graven / or
cast in any moulde (al which god has ones forever forbidden / as well to us as
to the Jews) But let us rather consider the very word of god / let us
occupye and busye our selves in it both night and day: In the stead of
Images let us look upon gods word*
Besides this / let all the whole frame of this world be a monumente and token
to put us in remembrance of god / that whatsoever true godliness is
remaining in us: Psalm. 1.
it may not by the works of men / but by the works of god well and after a
godly facyon co^sydered / inflame / and kyndle us to the praisynge and loving
of him. Now as touching to this reason / that some men do make for to excuse
the use of images / because (as they say) after that god taki^ge the nature of
man upon him / had vouchedsafe to live among me^ / and to be nailed fast to
the cross / and wylled the knowledge of himself to be egally publysshed and
declared unto all men: There is no cause why it should not be lawful to use
images but yet most specially of christ crucified / to the^tent yt we might
often times be put in remembrance / how by his death we have gotten redemption
and salvation. Verily we do not deny whatsoever holsom and profitable thing
has come to us by the death of Christ / which he suffrynge when he was
conversant among men / reconcyled ma^kinde to his father: yet that
natwithsta^dynge the same Christ did plainly witness that his bodily presence
was nothing profitable. Io. 6.
It is the spirit (says he) that quyckeneth. it was therefore for our profyt /
that he should bodily depart from us. Io. 16,
And for that cause after his resurrection he ascended up into heaven to the
right hand of his father / to the end that he might carry us also up to the
same place / if it be so that we have ryse^ with him in faith. 2 Cor 5
Besides this / wha^ Paul / according to the same sentence does openly say /
that albeit we know Christ as concerning his flesh / yet now we know hi^ so
no more: he sygnifyeth that another manner of worshippi^ge therefore is required
of us: that is to wit / a spu^all honor and such one / which may effectually
and strongly transform or hertes / which thing sith it can not be done by the
benefyte and help of images. let us say adue and farewell for ever to these
triflyng and unprofitable helps which are rather hi^derers of true faith and
godly living / tha^ monume^tes and tokens to put us in remembrance of godly
things. It is undoubtedly stark madness to desire to be put in remembrance of
ye benefytes of Christ by images / when Christ himself ought to work the same
in our minds / which in us and all creatures works all things. Lu. 22. 1
Cor 11
Did not christ institute and leave unto us the blessed sacrament of his body in
his holy supper / as a sufficient memorial to put us in remembrance of his
body crucified / and his precyouse blood shed for our redemption: saying / how
often soever ye do this thing / do it in ye remembrance of me / showing /
prechyng / and gyuynge thanks for my death until I come again. And wherefore
tha^ have we inverted (as though we had forgote^ gods own i^stitucion of his
holy sacrament) of our own folysh fantastical brain an image of christ
crucified to put us in mind of hi^ / contrary to his commandment? Let ds (I
say) have this Jesus nailed fast upon ye cross set up before the eyes of our
mind as often times as he tries us / and lays his cross upon us / by
pacie^s of trybulations and aduersytie. Let Christ so possess and fill ye
breast of a christen man / of who^ he has his name / that there be nothing but
it do put hi^ in remembrance of his lord / the creator and maker / ye
governor and the savior and preserver of all things. Wherefore so often times
as he looks up toward the sky / he can not choose but remember forthwt his
savior Christ / which reygneth above all heuens on the right hand of his
father. As Soon as he beholds the son / by and by he thi^keth upon Christ
the son of rightwisnes Christ is the son of rightwysnes,
and the light of ye world / which with his beams lyghteneth his heart. when
he seith a man / he reme^breth that Christ was made man for our sake. Christ
is man.
If he do mete with a king or a prince / anon Christ the king of kiges / and
lord of lords is in his remembrance / wha^ he hereth any preche or techer: Lo
/ straight ways hi mind is upon Christ the heavenly doctor and master: Christ
is our teacher.
as the garment done upon the body / does the body both profit and honesty:
even so does a godly mind think that christ is the very weddyng garment /
who^ all those persons have done on themselves / how many soever have be^
baptized. Christ is the wedding garment. Gala. 3 Christ is our heavenly meat
and drink.
A christen man never eteth and drinks / but forthwt he is put in remembrance
that christ is ye only and the very meat / which fedeth and norissheth us into
eternal life. Christ is the fountain of life. Iere. 2 104.7
If at any time he does occupye water / forthwith it comes to his mi^de ye
Christ is the fou^tayne / out of which we may draw drink against insatiable
thyrst. Christ is the lamb / the herdina^ / the door / the way etc.
Brefly / so often times as he shall se / either a sheep or a shepherde / a
gate / a way / a vynetree / or a stone / forthwith he conceyueth an image and
similytude of his lord Chrrist / Io 1.10 14.15.
which wyllyngly suffered hi^ self to be slain and offered up / for the
reconsylyacyon of the world / Io. 10. Io. 14.
which bosteth him self to be a good shepherde / which is the way and the
yate / by which men go and enter into heaven which witnesses him self to be
the true vynetre / the corner stone / and set for a foundation: Io. 15.
Ps 118. Esa. 28 1. Pe. 2 A goodly fruitful lesson / a present consolation for
the troubled mind,
Finally if thou be sore vexed with aduersytie / or else see any other man to
be in afflyctyon and calamytie. Besides this / if thou be troubled with
passions and noughty affectyons and desires / forthewith (if there be any percel
of Christ in the) set before the eyes of thy mind both the death and the
resurrection of Christ / that the syck soul go on pilgrimage unto Christ's
death.
and steadfastly and depely consider the^ / by the means whereof thou may in
such wise arm and fence thy mind with complete harness / so sure and so full
of most effettuall consolacyons / that thou shalt be able easily to abide and
overcome what soever aduersite shall fall unto the. So that if after this manner
and facyon we would have lust and pleasure to learn Christ perfytely in all
things / and his works with a certain lively felyng and judgment of the
mind / which should tra^sforme and change us: without dout the love of god
should be meruelously augmented and increased in us / and we should also (as it
were in a glass) see / with what comelynes / and after what manner and facyon
the course of this life ought to be passed over and brought to an end /
which no images can ever be able to teach us. Es. 44.
For these (of what so ever manner they be) can not set before thine eyes any
symilytude of god / but rather with a vain imagynation / when thou wenest that
thou art warm with a certain hot love and desire to consider and think upon
godly things / suddenly this heat and feruentnesse vanyssheth a way / and it
shall make the more neglygente to all true works semelye for a Christian man /
than ever thou wast before. We do therefore pytuousely deceive our own selves
with this flieng devotion / as they call it. For wha^ we have thought our
selves to be fed and full of better things: wind is vayn doctrine of men.
we find by experyence / sooner than we wol^^ have thought / that we have been
fed with mind (as it is said in the proverb) and that we are emptye and
void of meat / which does nourysshe and make fat in virtue and godly
living.

But as for these persons which trusting and berynge them selves bold upon
the law of christen lybertye / do excuse images / saying: That for this cause
they are not unlawful / because we may use them lawfully at our own pleasure /
as well as we may other outward things / and therefore that it is better that
there be images of Christ / than to have images of profane things. The
honor given to images* may not be rekened among outeward things.
I would that these men should first learn / that whatsoever images ar
honored or may be honored / are not to be accounted in the nombre of
outewarde things / and therefore they are used both to the iniurye of the
divine majesty / which only ought to be honored / and also to the
labefactacion and dekay of the faith There is no cause therefore / why the
consyderation of christen lybertye / may suffer in any wise such manner
images. For the lyberty of a christen man The liberty of a christian man.
is not a license to do whatsoever he list / but it is rather a voluntary
execution of virtuous works / which are done by the motyon of charity / and
not by the commandment and compulsyon of the law.

Now as touching the objection of some men The objections of some men.
/ that there is no cause why it may not be lawful for us to use pictures and
standing images. For likewise as men and those persons which have been
suffycyentely instructed in the true doctrine and faith of Christ / are
nothing offended nor do take any hurt by images: even so weke persons / and
such as be not yet well skylled i^ godly things / either wha^ they have
better instruction / and are taught the truth / shall be nothing hurt by the
reason of images / or if they be sturdy / and such as will not be taught /
they shall be nothing the better / though al images were clean taken away. So
than neither for the weke persons cause / neither for their cause which are
perfect. it is necessary to take away images Doutlesse / whosoever with such
forked reasons do coueyte to defend and mayntaygne images: They have not very
well considered nor wayed the counsel and intent of Paul / when he says:

All things are lawful for me: But all things are not expedyent nor
profitable. ^ Co 10


All things are laufull to me: but all things do not edifye.

And again in another place: Knowledge makes a man proud: but charytie does
edifye. 1 Cor 8


Also there is none that will understand and seek god. Ps. 14.


And again: take heed that your lybertye be not an occasyon of offense and
hurt to them which are weak. 1 Cor 8


We do not say / but images may be had / but yet in no place to be
worshipped. Solucio^


We do grant also that karuers and paynters crafts / are crafts both given
by god / and also lawful. But sith it is so / that in churches euerywhere /
images are honored and namely Roodes. It is not possible / though thou prech
never so often / or never so ernestly unto the people / that images are not to
be honored: but that there will be some / which will hold on still to put of
their cappes unto them / or else to lowte and make curtesye to them: yea / to
kiss their feet / to pray to them / to ask of them health / and to
commytte their vows and desires unto them: For such is the strength of an
old roted rotten custom / and the devil again exercyseth and puts forth
his crafts and disceytes so busely that they which be ones snarled in his
bonds / will never refrain from worshippynge of images. Now both the
occasyons and also the prouocatyons and entysementes of all such manner euyls /
must needs be taken a way / if Images were ones put down: And albeit truth it
is / which they say comenly / that where this vain perswasyon of images is not
plucked out of men's minds by the word of god / there can not the same be
taken away: no / not by the putting down of images: yet is it not generally
true / so that we may think it to be trewly said by all manner men
indyfferently / asmoch by one as by another. For by wicked men ye may well and
trewly say the same / which continue always like to them selves / and
change not their mind / whether thou do with words make plain the
abhomynatyon of images / or else do in very deed ryd all images quyte out of
sight. But to them that are weke / and in whom there is remaining any / be it
never so little spark of godly love and reverence: it shall not be
unprofitable nor in vain to wytnes and confyrme their doctrine with their
deed: that is for to say / after that thou have discrybed and pai^ted images
so as they ought to be with their own colors / borrowed of ye scripture / than
dilygently to provide that the same also be ryd out of men's sight. For by
that deed weke men shall be confermed / as in other things: so likewise in this
For thy teching shall be al in vain unless the example of thy deed do forthwith
follow / which shall cause thy doctrine to be of strength and auctorite. Paul
doutles thought it not suffycyente that the Corinthyans knew an ydole or image
to have nothing correspondente thereunto: 1 Cor 8
But he would also that the same people should in any wise abstain from
eating of the meats offered to images / and that for the weak persons sake
/ to whom full knowledge of such manner things was natte yet given. Therefore
he bade the Corinthyans to confyrme and fortifye this doctrine with the
auctoritye of their deed / and to refrain / not only from eating of the
flesh offered up in sacrifyce to ydoles and images / but also from all manner
things that might appear evil / or any manner way might offend weak
persons.

For albeit he gave them leave to eat all manner flesh: 1 Cor 9
even that also which was offered to images / if it were sold in the flesh
market: yet in the churches where they were offered up to images / he would in
no wise grant them lybertye to eat such meats.

Eue^ likewise do we judge / that it is to be thought of images (which likewise
/ as peradventure some man may have at home within his own house / so that it
be done without offendyng of his neighbor: even so the use of them in
churches or in other places / where either they may be worshypped or offend
and hurt their neybou^ is in no wise longer to be suffered. 1 Cor 8
Paul doutles had lever never to have eaten flesh in all his life than to
give his brother occasyon to be offended. And shall we all careless wynke at so
many occasyons both of offencyons and also of idolatry? Mat. 5
If Christ does bid the eye to be plucked out of the heed / which is an
obstacle / and impedyment to us. How much more tha^ ought pictures and images
to be plucked out of churches / by which we do not only offend weke persons /
but also do set forth our relygyon to be scorned and evil spoken of among
the Turks and jews which do conuynce us / that in this behalf we do against
the princypall points of the christen ^ayth. Would god that with this
su^ersticyon and vain honoring of images / we did not stop and keep away a
great meny / both of ^he Jews and also of the Turks / from receyuynge and
taking of the christen faith upon them.

tried by the squire and rule of gods word / if any thing do not agree with
it / it is to be cut away^ with all the speed that may be. and only that
thing which is righ^ and which is holesom / is to be restored to his own
place / and taken in his own place specially in the souper of the lord / in
baptym and other things also / which have been instytuted by the lord.

But images ar utterly to be taken away / not only for the abuses / but much
more for the word of god / to the which they are plain contrary and
repugnaunte. For we can not ymagen any manner vtilite which may be said to have
come by the reason of images. On the other side / that the supersticyon of
images does draw with it an heap of all euylles / we have heretofore
declared.

To make short / god never for bad any of these things / whereof any co^modyte
or profit might arise: but rather what soever thing is profitable and may
make us better / he taught full largely as witnesses Paul very euydently.

But if any folysshe wise man does think that images ar therefore not to be
taken away / because he fereth that those weke persons which now
supersticyously do worship images / would be offended with the putting down
of images: 2 Timothy 3
this man doutles whiles he goth about to avoid from the smoke (as it is
said in the proverb) is fallen into the flamynge fire. For whiles he fereth
to offend desperate persons / with hurtful offe^cyo^s of images he holds
back and hi^dreth better me^ / which have begone to run the way of the lord
without any turnynge again. Whosoever does this shall be gilty of that crime /
of which Paul accuses Peter in the epistle to the Galatians. Gala 2
For Peter whiles he was afraid to offend certain jews of Jerusalem at
Antioch / and for that cause would not use the liberty of eating all manner
meats as he was wont to do before: Paul withstode him to his face i^ the
presence of the whole multitude because he walked not the right way / according
to the truth of the gospel. For asmoch as was i^ him with his unwise desire
to avoid offendyng of the jews / he febled the right faith / and also
norisshed ye incredulyte and unbelief of them / whom he studied to please in
the mean season. Brefely he did no thing else / than whiles he went about
unwisely to avoid one ieoperdy he did cast hi^ self into twayn. Doutles after
this manner to desire to avoid occasyons of sclanders and offensyons / is the
full cause of offensyons. And would god it were not of so great strength as it is
among very many men now in these days. For a man shall se very many / which
because they would imagyne some honest cloak and color of their unbelief do
feign them selves both to do and also to eschew very many things lest they
might give any man occasyon to be offended / when in very deed they do it
rather to keep ye cross of Christ from themselves. For with this feigned desire
to win certain curable persons / they shifte well for themselves / that they
may neither have the evil will of desperate persons / neither any displeasure
or hurt done unto the^ by the same. We do not deny verily / that such manner of
doctrine and living is most to be enbraced and followed / which is an obstacle
or lettynge to no man / which does purposely anger no man / which does turn
no man's mind away from the truth: yet nevertheless great dilygence ought to
be given in the mean season / that none of those things be let of and omytted
whereby the glory of god and the health of our neyghtbours / may be furthered
and increased. Christ him self is the stomblynge stone unto the unbelievers:
but he is a precyouse stone / unto them which are fore ordained to life.

1. Pe. 2
After yt we our selves do know the will and pleasure of the lord / we must
dilygently labor that other men also may like and praise the same. and that
other men also may have lust and pleasure to confyrme them selves unto the
same. If we can not obtain this / than ought we rather to forsake father and
mother / and all our goods: yea / moreover to renounce our own selves than to
resyst or gruge against the will and pleasure of god. But most come^ly we se it
come to pass / that a great part of me^ had lever both to get / to maynteyne
and keep the favor of men with the minysshing of gods honor: Albeit / yet
it were better to win both ye favor of god and also of men / with honest
manners and honest living / and with ready desire and will to do good unto all
me^ / if we would begin this manner of winning the favor of me^ and in other
things would live in this world fautelesse / as nere as we could / doutlesse
there should be no man so parcyall in judgment but he would by and by gather in
mind / that he would neither presumptuously nor without good cause done of us /
that we have banysshed pictures and images clean out of churches. But whereto
should we make many words / sith it is euydent enough now / that images do
diminysshe the true honor of god / and that it is not possible / but that weke
men be greatly offended / and do take much hurt by them. For they (I mean weke
persons) would pass little upon the taking away of images / if they were
taught plainly for what consyderation and skyll they were taken away. On the
other side if they be not taken away / forthwith they conceive an opinion / as
though it were not laufull to put them away. Now after obstinate and incurable
persons / not only we can not with permyttyng / and wynkyng at images / bring
them to goodness: but also with our sufferaunce and slacknesse we shall
confyrme and establysshe them the more in idolatrye.

Brefely / if thou haste so great desire and love / to win many men to thy
lord / order thy self so that other men may in very deed see and perceive
experyence and proof that Christ is a live in the / and that all thy deeds and
saynges do breath and savor of him. With out doubt / if thou will order thy
self in this wise / thou shall cause even wicked men also / that they can not
choose but at the least wise closly in their hertes confess (their conscye^ce
driuyng them thereunto) that thou waste not only moved / but also compelled by
the zele of god to put away images. And though in the mean season many
things be wantynge in us: yet that natwithstandynge we ought to be
nevertheless dilygent / to provide that all such manner things be put away /
which soever ar repugnant to the word of god. Let us take no thought for any
manner thing which may cast us out any manner way of the favor of men. Let us
go straight forth and take the next way to fulfill the rule of a christen
man's life: For a true christen man / although he does in many things
aknowlege him self to be a sinner (as he is in very deed) yet does he neither
allow nor excuse any manner thing / which does minysshe or deface the honor of
his lord and master Christ.

Of the abuse of images we have spoken somewhat here tofore. But if any man do
somewhat dilyge^tely consydre and way the matter he shall perceive undoubtedly /
that imagis ar fallen into a far gretter abuse among Christian men / than
ever was among any heathen men. Images have given answers with us / they have
wept / one of the^ has be^ thought more holy and of more power tha^ another.
One more lovely and more gracious than another: a man shall find some / which
in a certain place have showed forth their power in worki^g of miracles when
they have been translated and removed into another place: And yet was it satan
that thus strongly deluded us / with lyeng miracles for our hatynge of the
truth / and for our misbeleue, 2 these 2
they have cessed to do the same. Of the image at Lauretum / and diverse other:
sith the matter is known well enough / we need not to say any thing at all.
And I pray you / how much richesse in the mean season has this superstition
of images gathered together / not without plentuouse occasyon of sclanderouse
offenses: would god the miracles of the ymagis of walsyngham / ca^torbury /
pppeswiche / haples / worcester, and chestre, and such other were well tried by
scripture to see what article of our faith they have confirmed.
which said riches / the glotony and pomp of a sort of unthrifty idle belyes
has destroyed and wastfully consumed. In as much therefore as true / full and
perfyte faith can not suffer so great abhomynatyon: and sith it can not be
plucked up by the rotes with the word alone (for with the goodly and gloriouse
apparau^ce of holiness / and also by the reason of long custom and
contynuance it has gotten so great auctoritye and estimatyon to it self) it
is to be put away by the deed self.

And whereto needs it to suffer those things among Christen men which as
they can not but engendre euylles out of nombre: so can they cause no hope nor
lokynge of any manner profit to come by the^ unto any man / unless it be to
the idle viciouse belyes that receyuen the offrynges. It did become us christen
men most of all to be moved and styred with the word of god / which does so
plainly and so expressly forbyde all manner of images. Whatsoever is reed
concerning images in the law / in the Prophets / in the Psalms / does much
more justly apperteyne unto us which ar taught by Christ / that god is to be
worshipped i^ spirit and truth / and that Christ also is not to be worshipped
i^ images of wood / of stone / of silver / or of other metal: Io. 4*
Colo. 3
but that he is to be worshypped rather syttyng on the right hand of his
father / and that all the members of the said Christ that is to wit our
neybours are to be socoured with deeds of charity.

And these few things among many / it has lyked us to borowe of the
scryptures against pictures and images / which scripture alone / a christen
has regarded unto / as unto the shote ankre in all things both which are to
be desired / and also which are to be eschewed. But yet because it can not be
but pleasure and conforte to the same Christen man / whatsoever either doctrine
or examples he shall find in the saints of god / which is consona^t and
agreynge to the scryptures. Not in saites of the Busshops of Romes making ^
canoni ^ynge.
We have thought it expedyente to bring forth a few things of the writings
of the fathers / by which the godly reder shall easily perceive that the
apostles / martyrs / and all the best learned and most ancient fathers taught
the same thing / which is ordained and commanded by the word of god / until
such time as by the Gothyans and the Vandalyans / the christen faith and the
more pure knowledge of the truth began to be greatly minysshed and brought in
dekay. For in the time of saint Hierome / and certain years after him / we
do not read / that any bishop being of wise judgment / did suffer pictures
or images in the churches of christen men. Of the which thing Epiphanius
Epiphanius.
/ the most holy bishop of Salamine / in the isle of Cyprus / shows an
evident example in his epistle to Johan the bishop of Jerusalem / which
epistle saint Hierome translated into Latyne. For this he writes: When we
went together to the holy place / which is called Bethell / to make a
collectyon there for poor people with the / accordi^ge to the custom and
manner of the church: and I was come unto the vyllage which is called Anablatha
/ and as I passed by did see a burning lamp / and I had asked what place it
was / and had learned that it was a church / and had entered into it to pray. I
did find there a veil hanging in the church doors / colored and painted /
and having as it were the image of Christ / or of some saint (for I do not well
remember whose image it was) I say / when I had seen that in the church of
christ there did hang the image of a man / against the authority of the
scryptures. It is against the authority of scripture any image to be in the
church.
I did cut it / and gave counsel to the kepers of that place that they should
rather wind some poor man that were deed / and bury him in it. And they again
grudgynge / said by me: If he had minded to cut it / it was reason and
right that he should give another veil and change this: which thing when I had
herd / I promised that I would give one / and send it forthwith. Howbeit I
deferred the sendynge of it somewhat the longer / by the reason that I intended
for to send a very good veil in the sted of it. and I thought yt I should
have had one sent unto me out of Ciprus. Now I have sent such one as I could
get / and I pray you that you will bid the prestes of the same place to
receive this veil of the bringer which we have sent / and afterward to
command that no mo such manner vayles / which are contrary to our relygion /
be hangen up in ye church of Christ.

Lo / here the sentence of the most virtuous bisshoppe / in which he gives
judgment / by express and plain words / that it is against scripture and
our relygion / that images of christ ar had in the churches of christen men /
whereof we may gather evidently that in this matter / both Jerome and also
other bisshops were of the same mind that Epiphanius was of. Herfore Eusebius
Eusebius
also reherseeh / as a strange and an vnwonte thing / that in Cesarea Philippe
(in which cite the woman was borne / whom Christ healed from the flux of
blood) He did see two images of brass / the one of ye woman / the other of
christ our savior / which images yet were set up at church doors / not in
the church self / as the same Eusebius records. Man. 5.
And at the last he says thus: It is no merueyle if those persons of the
gentyles which did believe / were seen for such benefytes as they had received
of the savior / to offer / as you would say / such a manner reward or
recompense / sith it is so that we do see images and tables of the apostles
Peter and Paul / and also of Christ our savior to be karue^ and painted: even
these dates also We have seen moreover old images of them kept of certain
persons / which thing me think is observed / according to the custom of the
gentyles without any dyfference / because they are wont in such wise to honor
them / whom they thought worthy of honor. The making and honori^ge of
images, came first from the gentyles to the jews / and so unto us.
For that the arms or images of old men are reserved and kept for a
remembrance to them that shall come after: it is a sign and token both of
their honor / and also of those men's love toward them. The vii. book the
xiiii. ca.
Thus says Eusebius in the ecclesyasticall history.

Hereof we do easily perceive / that the images which Eusebius did se / were
set up / not within the churches / but at the church doors.

Again / not to the^cent that they should be honored / but rather that they
should be a testimony and record how great and valiant me^ they were sometime
/ and therefore worthy to be had in perpetual memory / whose images were
reserved and kept: All which things nevertheless Eusebius does not hyde /
to have taken their beginning of the gentyles and heathen people. But what
think ye that he would have said if he had seen images set up in churches /
and no less worshyped of christen me^ / tha^ ever they were of any gentyles /
which thing (a lack for petye) it is undoubted both than to have be done:
yea / and to be done even now i^ these days also. Of these things therefore we
may gather what is ye cause / why the old fathers did write nothing against
such manner of images: for there was no man at that time which did so much as
ones dreme / that ever so great a multitude of images should crepe into churches
as has cropen in: for asmoch as they know it to be forbidden with so open and
euydent words of god / and plain testimonies of the scripture. But against
the images of the gentyles / a man shall find many things written by the
fathers / very connyngly and eloquently / because the supersticyon of them did
reygne euerywhere even at the same time / in which those holy men were
living. yea and was defended of the gentyles with the same wepens / with
which both in our time / and also in the time of our fathers / certain
christen men have gone about to defend and maynteyn their images. (...) we ^e
(...) wh^^eur ^mage is
What so ever thing Lactancius Lacta^t^us
wrote against the idols and images of the gentyles / we may by very good
right apply the same agai^ste our images: albeit in his time (as we have said)
they were not yet used among christian men. Among many places it lyketh me at
this time to allege one: for thus he demau^deth of the ge^tyls: Libro. ii. ca.
iii.
If you do therefore fere and worship yor gods by such images / because you
do judge the^ to be in heaven: why do you not than lift up your eyes in to
heaven? why do you rather look to walls / to stocks and stones / than to that
place where you do believe that they be? This same question in like manner may we
demand of our supersticyouse christian men: If they do believe that god and
saints are in heaven / why do they not rather lift up their eyes to that
place / than to the deed images? But let us here also Athanase Athanasius.
/ writing in this wise against the ge^tyles. It is impossyble that any image
ca^ now represente either man or woman deperted: for the body is earth, and
the soul is a spiritual thing unable to be represented by any sensyble
exterme image. wherefore Paul says / we know that whatsoeur image is in this
world / it is a vain thing nothing represe^ti^g nothing signifyeng.
Let the^ say (I beseech you) how or after what manner god is known by images /
whether is it by the matter and stuff put round about them: orels is it by the
shape and facyon brought i^ to the stuff? If it be by the stuff of the images
that he is known / than what needs any shape or facion to be brought in by
the workman? and why is not god showed and known as well by all manner of
stuff before yt any images be made / sith all things do witness and declare
his glory? But if the shape and facyon brought in to the stuff be the cause of
the knowledge of god: what needs than any payntynge or any other stuff at all?
and why is natte god known rather by the very lively creature / whose shapes
or images be so perfectly known? for doutlesse ye glory of god should be more
clearly and euydently known / if it were showed by the lively creatures both
reasonable and unreasonable / than by the deed and immovable creatures. God is
known says Paul. To. i. by the creation of this world.
Therefore when you do grave or paynte images / for the intent to have
understanding and knowledge of god: forsooth you do an unworthy and an unmeet
thing. etc. Now Athanasius would never have purposed in his mind / to write
any such manner thing against the gentyles / if he had seen the christen men
of his time entangled and wrapped in such superstityon of images / as we do see
a great part of ye world to be pytuousely snarled now in our time: but he
would rather have exercised his pen against christen men / if they had been
like our christen men now a days. But nothing lets / but that we may very
accordingly apply the same thing against our supersticyous christen men: For
they pretend ye same cause of having images / with the which Athanasius
reherseth that the gentyles were moved that is to wit / that by images they
may be put in remembrance of god: which thing sith the creatures of god
(whether we do consydre the stuff or the shape / and facyon of the^) may do it
much more effectually (as Athanasius iugeth full well) there is no need that
we should run unto the works of men / which do represent but only I wot
not what false and vain image unto us. For whom soever trees / stones / silver
/ gold / and other stuff / whereof images are made: finally whom the sight of
man / to whom god has given life and reason can natte styre nor put in
remembrance of god: surely images shall natte styre up that man with any fruit
or profit: for they (as Origin writes against Selsus) do rather pluck away
the memori and mind of man from god / and do turn the eyes of the mi^de
bacwardes / to behold and consydre erthly things. For every man knows / that
the more nere that one thing resembles another in nature and property / so
much the more strongly it does renew the remembrance in us of that thing /
to whom it is like. For trees or stones do more surely and lively put us in
remembrance of god / when they are co^sydered of us / having their own
natural shape and facyon / so as they were first created of god: than when by
the work and craft of men being beryued of their own natural shape / they
do express and resemble unto us the image and likeness of man / or of any
other thing. For sooner shall the remembrance come to thy mind of the Karuer
or Paynter / whose workmanship thou do merueyle at / than the remembrance of
god / the creator and maker of all things. It is therefore nothing else but a
pure disceyte of the devil / which calls us from the praisynge and
charitable loving of the lively images of god / unto deed images of wood or
stone / which some man a folysshe cou^terfaiter of god / has folysshly karuen
or painted. We could also allege many other testymonyes out of the writings
of the fathers: but it should be all in vain / to recyte any mo to him which
is natte moved with these which we have already rehearsed.

Here we have thought it very expedient and necessary to declare and make
plain / according to the truth of hystories / when and by what begynners
images began to come up among christen men: and who again on the other side
did their endeavor to put the^ down and with how much business / and how
great ieoperdy / good and well dysposed me^ have attempted this thing / until
the church was brought into this present condition and state of things
falling incessantly to worse and worse. Very ydelnes / and idle negligence of
Bysshoppes* suffered first this idolatry of worshipping images ^o enter in to
the church / and their gredye and insaciable covetousness holds yet stylle
this idolatrye.
Undoubtedly the laws / as well of the christen emperors / as of the christen
counsels / made against images / came than first forth / wha^ through the
slothfulness and negligence of bishops / and their vain curyouse desires to win the favor of god / not only images and pictures crepte into the churches /
but also (which is wont comenly to chance) they began to be worshipped of the
people. We read that Serenus / the bishop of Massilia Serenus bishop of
Massilia.
/ a very holy man / was so displeased / and took it so greuousely (as reason
was) that images were set up in churches: that he did cast down all the
images atones which were in his church: did break them / and at the last did
also burn them. We do not deny / but that this deed of Serenus was sore
rebuked of Gregory which was called Gregorius magnus Gregorius Magnus.
/ and that the said Serenus was admonysshed and counseled of the said
Gregorye Great gregory began first to teach his flock with these bilde books
/ that he should not forbid or let images to be had but that he should teache
the honourynge of them in any wise to be avoided. But what other thing should
the sta^derdberer of relygio^ and virtue falling in decay / do in this matter /
as well as in many other? By this manner of doctrine, may yei^ge what a shepard
this great doctor was.
For about yt time the church of Rome began to threten / pronosticate and give
lykelyhod of great ruyn of the faith afterward to follow.

But among the Greeks / Leo Leo Emperor of the Greeks.
the emperor / the.iii. of that name a man both well learned / and also virtuous
and godly (he raygned in the year of our lord.vii.C.lxxxiiii) distroyed all
images universally / and commanded Gregory the.iii. here may ^e smell what a
sheperde Gregory the third was.
of that name by his letters / that he should do the same thing likewise at
Rome. But this Gregory not only refused to be obedyent to the emperors
commandment / Before he would not have them honored, and now in despite of
themperoure he decreed them to be in high honor.
but also at Rauenna was the author and be gynner of sedition / to which city
he called a certain meyny of bysshoppes and made a counsel / in which he
decreed against themperours commandment / that images ought to be had in
much more honor than ever they were before.

And to the intent that he might the moore boldly instytute this thing
against the emperor with out any punysshement: Co^sta^tine the v.
Here the^peroure called a counsel without the co^se^t of the bishop of Rome
/ yea, and corrected the former erronius and scismatike counsel of the bishop
of Rome by the scriptures,
not very long before / he had gone about traitourously to forsake the emperor
and to fall unto the part of the french king. After the death of Leo /
Constantyne his son / the fyfth of that name / wyllyng to conferme his
fathers commandment and decree / called together all the learned men and
bysshoppes out of all Greece land / being in no^bre. CCC.xxx. which comparynge
the scriptures to the reasons of the counsel / which we spoke of before /
called by Gregori: determined with one consent That it is not laufull to them
which by Christ do believe in god / to have any images either of the creatoure
or the creatures to honor them: but rather of the ieoperdyes of offensyons or
hurtes that they were all to be taken away atones So that from the beginning
of Leo / Constantyne his son / and all his successors did cleue to / and
abide by it / until such time that the cruel woman Hirene Hiren.
went about that horrible and exceeding wicked tragedy / whereof we shall speak
not long herafter. But the decrees of that wicked woman / were vertuousely
abrogated and suppressed by Co^stantins son the syxte of that name. There
comes now happily to my mind / the decree of Theodosius Theodosius.
and Valens Valens.
/ which Petrus Crinitus Petrus Crinitus.
/ a man that had red many things / does recyte in the nynth book / De honesta
disciplina: his own very words. I shall faithfully and truly rehearse:

Valens and Theodosius The decree of Theodosius and Valens.
the noble emperors wrote to ye officer called Prefectus pretorius: Forasmoche
as our dilygent study and care is / in all things to maynteyne and uphold the
faith and honor of god: we forbid any manner man to grave or make the image of
christ our savior of stone / of wood / or of any other stuff / or else to
paynte ye same with colors. yea / and whersoeuer any such image be found / we
command that it be taken away / and they sore punysshed / who soever shall
attempt any thing contrary to our decrees and commandment / in which
thing if any man do require an author / let him read the decrees and
commandments of Emperors / which have been collected and gathered by a
satyr of the right conning men / Tribunianus / Basylydes / Theophilus /
Discorus / and other / at the commandment of the most noble Emperor
Justinian.

Thus far says Crinitus.

It is therefore euydent and manifest / that themperours also which were before
the time of Leo / did dilygentlye provide / that the supersticyon of Images
should not by any manner means pollute and defyle the churches of christian men.
The first of all other (as far as we can gather of hystories) which did cause
Images to be painted in churches: Was Pontius Paulinus bishop of Nola
Pontius paulinus bishop of Nola the first causer that images were painted.
/ about the year of our lord ccccl. For he solemnisynge yearly the birth day
of saint Felix / was wont to make a great and a costly fest unto the church /
and to thentent that they which sat at the seid fest / should be the sooner and
more easily provoked to temperaunce / and to the co^syderatyon of godly
things: he painted on the church walls / images of the histories of the old
testament / that they should have somewhat also wherewith they might feed and
delight their eyes frutefully. Before this Paulinus you shall not lightly find
that any such things was attempted by any man / at the leastwyse / being of
any famous memory. For in such wise by little and little / this supersticyon
must needs crepe in: likewise as other things did / which have corrupted the
puryte and prefection of the church. Now who is he / that does not perceive
and see / that Paulinus did two manner ways offend? for first against the
commandment of saint Paul / he was bold / and took upon him self to make
open festes in the church. And (which again was as great an offense / and
such as can not be excluded) he begane with images to exhort men unto the
love and exercisynge of temperaunce / when he being a christen man / ought
rather to have gone about to do the same / with holesom doctrine and good
example Wherefore it does euyde^tly appear that this bishop did in no wise
begin that thing of a pure godly spirit: but if a man will do well co^sydre
and way euerythynge / he shall find yt with the same spirit / that is to
wit / most recheles and dispysyng of godly things: other men also have taken
upon them to defend images. For the popes and bisshops (I wotte not whether
through evil will / or else through a certain pride) began with tothe and
nail to defend the use / or rather the abuse of images against the Greek
emperors: until such time as by the labor and help of Hyrenes Hirene
Empress.
(which after the deceasse of Leo her husband / had the rule and governance of
thempyer many years) a counsel was assembled at Nice Here may ye se what rule
this wicked woman bare in the counsel of Nece.
/ in which counsel she caused to be abrogated and dysadnulled whatsoever was
before decreed by Constantyne / concerning the putting away of images.
Neither could this wickedness suffyce and content her mind: but she did
cause the body of Constantyne to be dug up again out of the ground to be
brent to ashes / and last of all to be thrown into the sea.

This very same Hyrene / after that she was by her son deposed from her
tyrannouse empery / left nothing unassayed nor never rested until by
abominable and traytorous crafts she wan again the empier unto her self:
which thing when she had brought to pass / according to her own mind / she
did cast her son into prison / plucked out his eyes / and in conclusyon
slew hi^ also. here may ye see by what a wicked Bishop of Rome consedered
with a wicked woman / the Impery was craftily tra^slat^d from the Greeks to the
french men.
But when she fered that her tyranny should not continue nor last long / she
made labors (the pope of Rome being broker and spokesman) to be married unto
Charles the great / otherwise called Charlemayne / king of France: and for this
cause she gave license to the bishop of Rome to translate the crown of
thempier of Rome unto Charles / hoping verily that her own tyranny should be
safe / if by translatyng thempier of the Greeks traytorousely unto the
Frenchemen / she did bind / not only Charles / but also the bishop of Rome:
and make them her friends with this great benefyte.

But when Nicephorus Nicephorus.
/ which than was captain of the army of the Greeks perceived these
traytorouse disceytes / forthewith in all have he did cast Hirene into prison /
as she had discerued / in which she made a wretched end / and changed this
life with death / worthy and mete for such goodlye acts as she had done. O
cruel woman,
This same Hyrene which dygged up the deed body of her father in law and
brent it. Which put out her own sons eyes / and slew hi^ in prison: which
betrayed the emperor of the Greeks: and this same bishop of Rome / the
cou^seller and helper of the most wicked and ungracious woman's purposes and
enforceme^tes: which bishop took away from the right and laufull emperor
his empyer / and did put in another i^ to the empier who^ it pleased him self:
but yet upon this condicyon / that he himself should have Rome and Italye for
his part: This worshipful couple (I say) aduau^ced images unto this
estimatyon and honor. For whatsoever images or pictures ar i^ estimation: they
may not without good cause thank these two: for it / as their first beginners
/ howbeit the successors also of Charles / did afterward their dilygent
endeavor to maynteyne and uphold these abhominatyons: lest the foundation and
ground work of idolatrye which charles had laid / should have lacked
building to garnysshe it full of all impyetie and wickedness. Howbeit these
men in times passed / did never than pollute and defyle temples and churches
with so many images / and showing so manifest appearance of idolatry (which
thing we may perceive and see even yet by those which they build) as have been set up euerywhere in these last v. hundredth years / to the occasyon of
most vain honor: which honor to thentent to make it ye more accepted with
false and lyeng wonders / he styred up and moved supersticyouse persons in
every place / to begin pylgrymages to such images to their great hynderance
both of god / of faith / and of godliness. For (I pray you) tell me what
other thing shall a man find in such manner churches of the blessed virgin:
than certain filthy and smoky images? for god (such is his exceeding
goodness) lest any occasyon of ydolatrye should be left unto men / he would
that the body of the blessed vyrgin should not be known where it became,
Likewise as he did by the body of Moses. And yet as noma^ ca^ expres an angel
by any sensyble images so is there nothing ^depted represe^ted by th^se images
of saints.
We will say nothing here of the images of saint Anne / of saints / nor of the
images of Angels: which men with like supersticyon have begone to set up /
welnere in every corner / and to worship them. And (which is as great a
folysshnes as may be) when there are so many images ofte^tymes in one church: to
one they do give I wot not what power of workynge miracles / to the great
hynderaunce and contempt of all the resydue. Brefly / so great is the vanyte of
images that though i^ very deed they could put us in remembrance of god: yet
nevertheless for diverse occasyons of offencyons and idolatry / it were
expedient and necessary to have them taken away in all the have / according to
the example of Esechias the most holy king / which did cast down and break the
brazen serpent / which was set up by the commandment of god: when he had
perceived that it was worshipped contrary to the commandment of god. In the
xviii. cha of the iiii. book of the kings.


These things which we have hitherto recyted / if he that favors the glory
of Christ / will dilygently way and consydre i^ his mind he shall undoubtedly
perceive / that whatsoever images ar honored in churches / or any manner way
may be honored / neither ought neither may be suffered among christen men /
unless we will do against the manifest precepte of god / and despise and set
at naught both the faith and also the examples of the apostles / martyrs / and
of also of holy fathers. Finally except we can find in our heart in the
stead of the laws / which have been made both by Christen emperors / and
also counsels to receive the traditions of the bishop of Rome / and of the
most wicked woman / whose delight and pleasure both of them was in trayson /
roberyes / and contynuall study / to deuyde and distroye the empyer.

Finally as concerning the taking down and puttyng away of alters / erecte
and dedycate unto images or saints / they which have known the wicked
abusyons of the mass / may and will be sone satisfied and contented without
any great business: but they which do not know the said abuses / can not be
lightly pacifyed: unless they be first taught how great the abuses of the
mass ar in the sight of god.

Therefore this one thing we desire to be considered of them that fere / dread /
and love god / in what manner and for what end / purpose and intent / christ
our savior did institute his holy supper. Truly to thentent that his discyples
(that is to say / they which will live accordynglye to his doctrine and
commandment) assemblynge together / The supper of our lord was come to mani
me^ celebrated at his table / and not a private eating and drinki^ge of one
alone at the auter
should take that mystical breed / and mystical drink in comen / and
eueryone put other in remembrance of that incomparable charytie of Christ / by
which he suffered death for their saluatyon: and by the reason thereof / their
faith and trust in god being increased / should be inflamed both with the
hatered of sins / and also with love of all virtues / professynge them
selves to be one body and one breed in Christ. the first of the Cori^. the x,
capi.
By this means only holy me^ ar nourysshed with christ the meat of life.
Now compare unto these things / that which is comenly done in masses. Masses
of the popysshe priests most specially are done for their own belyes sake: or
else at the lestwyse to purchase some merit before god / which thing not only
declares the abuses thereof / but also that they thus abused ar displesant and
abhomynable to god. Besides this there are said and done many things / which
do turn away our minds from christ which reygneth in heaven / unto the work
of the priest. The congregatyon hereth no doctrine or exhortacyon i^ their
mother tongue / that they might be edifyed thereby. There is no communyon had /
although the words which the priest reherseth do make mention of it. And
whiles the priest alone does receive the breed and the cup of the lord:
there is not celebrated that same supper that Paul speaks of. for in the
first epistle to the Corinth. The.xi. chapter / he speaks of no private
supper / but of a comen supper of many together. There are said also many
things which are plain repugnant to the scripture for they do teach to trust
unto the merytes and intercessyon of saints. And (which thing is most
hyghlye to be abhorred) where as the only one oblatyon of Christ (by which
only ones done upon the cross / we are assoyled and sanctified for evermore)
ought to be preched: the pressed bosteth / that as often times as he does his
mass / so often times he does offer Christ to his father / and therefore does
by it obtain the putting away of all euyls / and a hepe of all good things
to them only / which by gyuynge any thing to the preeste / do make them
selves partetakers of the mass / by the reason whereof it is come to pass /
that so many men / all care of innocence laid a part do hope that heaven
shall be opened unto them eue^ by such manner masses alone. Whosoever recogniseth
and knowlegeth the lord Jesus as our only savior and sanctifyer. If he do
consider these things dilygently / and with the same do compare these things
which our lord both said and did / and besides that did betake to us for to
be reiterated and often times put in use he shall easily perceive and see /
that there was never any supersticyon in times passed / which had in it self
so great impietye and wickedness / so great contempt of god / so great
distructyon of all virtues / as has ye detestable and abominable abuse of the
mass / so as it has been abused these certain years. And hereof when he
knows / that nothing is so much to be hated and abhorred of christen men: he
shall perceive that all remembrance of this abuse is utterly to be taken away.
And therefore thabused alters / the very open shoppes of so great idolatrye /
and the riches of these sacrifyces / even the pernicyouse su^ptuouse wives to
all christen people no rulers in any condityon willing their office to be
approved only of Christ ought in no wise to suffer them. Let christen me^ know
the truth of the matter / and than afterward let them judge.

Last of all / this thing also is to be observed i^ this matter / though never
so great offe^cyons and occasions of euyls come through pictures and Images / It
belongs to the chief rulers to reform these abuses.
abused masses / and false and vayn worshyppyng of saints / that yet for all
that / it is not laufull for any private man / but the heed offycer and ruler
to cast the^ out / namely out of open and common places. For in asmoche as
they are outward things / no man ought to take upon him more power over them
than the condition and state of every man shall require / that is to wit /
that every man privately banyshe them out of his own mind / reiectynge the
folyshe estimation of them. Now to an householder it belongs / according to
thexample of James the patriarche James the patriarche.
/ to cleanse and rydde his house of them. But to cast them out of churches
and comen places it is the duetye of the heed offycer and gouerner / which
duty (thanks be to Christ) our governor has known / and has executed
with christian grauite. And one thing it is to be eschewed in this business /
likewise as in all other / which it belongs to Christen men's charge for to
do (and it is the counsel of Saint Paul) that we do not set forth our
goodness to the evil words of men: and that the thing which was instytuted
to the health and salvation of many men / be not an occasyon of hurt to any
man. Wherefore if any man in destroyeng of images / should do any thing
presu^ptuousely outragiously / and pass the measure of charity / he should
bind hi^ self by so much to the more greuouse sin / by howmoch the thing
is more holy / in which he follows his own sensual lust / and the officer
ought (not without good cause) to punysshe hi for brekyng of love and
charytie. Also it ought not to be ascribed to any ourtragyousnesse / though
vnsensyble and dombe images be not so softly and so tenderly handled / as
certain men (through a folysshe imaginatyon / Images have hands and feel not
/ eyes and see not, ears and hear not etc. and yet will we ride and go many a
mile to worship the^ with prayer, ca^delles, cotes / shoes / and money.
as though with the figure and symilitude of man / they had also ma^s wits and
reason) ar wont to have compassyon / and to sorrow some what when they are
broken. For if we were disposed to take away images / after such manner and
facion as scripture techeth and commands / which facion doutlesse must
needs be best: we ought to break them / yea / and that all to powder / that
they might never be made whole again / nor be restored in to so wicked an
abuse in which we ought not to have so greatly regarded the labor and craft
of man / sith it is our duty to offer even our own selves also to the cross
/ and to all manner afflyction / rather than to be willing to give occasyon of
falling / and of idolatry to any man yt walks in ye way of virtue and
godliness. And would god there were in all men asmoche care and dilygence to
make much of / and to be ware of offendi^g or hurting the very lively images
which god himself has made to his own likeness: as we do see to be in very
many men / that these deed and dombe images should not be hardly / nor
irreverently entreated. To conclude / shortly to pluck down images and
pictures / and to rid the^ quyte out of churches is an holy thing / and ought
to be begone according to the commandment of god. It is conuenyent therefore
and mete / that it be performed and fulfilled in such wise / that it may be
accepted and allowed of almightye god. That is to wit / that they be so taken
away / that there be no whit of them remayni^g / namely to like abuse / and
also yet nevertheless / nothing be done presu^ptuously / nor outragiously /
nothi^ge that may give any man good cause to be troubled but that all things
be done charitably of pure and perfect love / and desire to do profit to all
men. and after this facyon god grant yt his people may be delivered from
idols and images through the whole world from the one end to the other. Amen.

The translatoure of this little treatise out of Latyne into English to the
indyfferent reder.
Sith it is chaunsed unto me (good indyfferent reder) ye same thing that
happens / and abides every man / which of a good zele endeavors hi^ self
to promoue / further / and set forth ye gospel / to the honor and glory of
god / and edifye^ge of his church / beit by sincere and true prechynge or
otherwise translatyng or compylyng of any / beit never so fruitful a treatise
/ even to be mystaken and mysreported. And yet I did but only the office of a
faithful translatour / interpretyng the words and sentences of the^ which did
first make ye book / which authors sith they be of no les leenynge than
judgment / and so many gathered together in one consent confyrmed with
scryptures every where / and by their adversaries yet never impugned ne
confuted / and the book both in latin and also in Duch freely red and sold by
the space of.v. years now fully passed in every church where the execrable
rytes and tradicyons of the bishop of Rome be expulsed and put out / and the
gospel brought in purely and syncerely to be preached. I thought it might
well and worthily be translated. yea / and so much the more was I animated and
encouraged the same to do: because I did here our chief preachers / men not
only of good learning and pure judgment / but also of estimation and
authority in their sermons daily preach freely against the same abuses and
utterly condemn them. And if an indyfferent reder with judgment / would
confer the places / and expende the mind of the authors / he should see
them speak / neither against the mass / ne yet against the blessed sacrament
that Christ instituted: but only against the abuse of the mass / and
sacrament brought in of the bishop of Rome / and his adherentes / to satisfye
their insaciable belyes / to feed their avarice and to supporte and maynteyne
their false usurped dignyte and power. Nevertheless to satisfye some men I am
now compelled again to printe this little treatise defensed with this buckler
/ that is to say / that where they report me to have dispysed the mass or the
supper of the lord as scripture calls it / tha^ the which thing (I take
god to witness) I thought nothing less but I say to them and afferme it
constantly / that I do but only speak against the abuses thereof / and that
mass only is there spoken of (as every reasonable man may perceive and see)
which is instytuted and abused by the bishops of Rome / their popysshe
complyces / and counselors / which they bye and sell as Judas did / and offer
up Christ again for money / when it stands plainly in the.ix. chap. to the
Hebrews / that Christ therefore is not entered into heaven because that he would
many times and often offer up himself for so must he have oftentimes suffered /
from the time that he went up. But he suffered but ones: yea / and that now in
the end of ye world. Wherefore he must be but ones offered up / which to
conferme yet more certainly / he adds in the next chap. these words: Vnica
enim oblatione. etc. That is to say: by only one oblacyon he has
effectuousely for evermore made the^ perfect / which are his holy elect /
against which abuses only that place in ye later end of this little treatise
speaks / which manner of masses thus bought and sold / and in the which they
so often for money offer up crist crucifyenge him again: it were better that the
(...) than daily thi^ (...) holy a sacrame^ (...) holyer intent ins^ (...) and
executed in the (...) mityue church / in t^ (...) appostles / wherefore I (...)
by a few moo words (...) that place / that so has often (...) some men more
plainly expres^^^ and declared the minds of the authors. So that from
henseforth I trust no man will be offended with this little treatise / but
only they / in whose breasts the popysshe tradicyons do yet stycke fast /
whose conscyences ar yet marked with his whote iron / and out of whose hertes
his abuses are so loath to be extirped and drawn out. But god almighty which
of his merciful goodness of the ungodly makes a rightwyse man / and of (...)
^oure of his (...) ^e farue^t prea^ (...) breath his holy (...) to the hertes of

(...) ^wlege and vnderstan^ynge of the truth of gods word.

AMEN.
