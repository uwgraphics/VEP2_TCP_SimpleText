By his Majesty's Council for VIRGINIA.
SIGILVM REGIS MAGNAE BRITANIAE FRANCIAE ET HIBERNIAE
PRO CON SILIO SVO VIRGINIAE


WHereas sundry the adventurers to Uirginia in their zeal to that memorable
work, the plantation of that country with an English Colonie, for the
establishing of the Gospel there, and the Honor of our King and country, have
published a little standing Lotterie, consisting but of 12. pence for every
Lot: And therein have proportioned to the adventurers more then the one half
to be repayed in money or fair Prizes without any abatement, besides sundry
other Welcomes and Rewards: hoping that the inhabitants of this honorable
City aduenturing even but small sums of money, would have soon supplied so
little a sum appointed to so good a work: which we did purpose to draw out
in Candlemas Term last: yet now seeing that the slow bringing in of their
money has crossed our intents, either because there was no certain day
nominated for the drawing thereof, or for some lewd aspersions that no good
success was likely to ensue to this action.

We do therefore signify, that a month past, we sent away a ship thither
with her competent number of good men and munition, and do purpose continually
to supply them to the utmost of our means. The rather for that we have
information from them, that they are now able to subsist of themselves, and
want only more able laboring men, and convenient clothing for them.

In consideration whereof, we do certify all men, that we do purpose (God
willing) to begin the drawing of this Lotterie the 10. day of May next. And
that the last day of bringing in any money shall be the 3. day of the same
month: Betwixt which times the books shall be brought in, and made up, and the
Lots written out proportionablie according to the moneys that shall come in.

Swanne in Paul's Churchyard. 1613.
