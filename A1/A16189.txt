To the Reader.
WHat great good and profit (gentle Reader) is procured unto all Seafaring men
by Books of Seacardes / which heretofore have bin made and composed by Lucas
Johnson Waghenaer / Albert Hayen / William Barents and others / wherein they
with most great diligence have written the situation of the Streams / Havens
and Channels of the Seas in diverse Countries / it is impossible to declare / for
that thereby not only many Ships and Merchants goods / but also many Men
have had their lives preserved / which is so manifest and well known unto
every man / that it were altogether needelesse and in vain to illustrate it
by examples.

It is also well known to every Seafaring man / how much some Havens and
Channels in the Seas / are and have been in process of time clean altered and
changed / specially in these Countries of Holland / Zealand and Freesland /
which also for the most part are so much altered / since then were described by
the said Authors / that some of them have now no likeness nor similitude
thereof / some are almost spoiled / and some wholly abolished / and clean
stopped up: for the North Chanel / which by Waghenaer and Albert Hayen was
described to be the best Chanel of the Vlie / at this present reaches out
clean contrary / and therewithal it is so much altered / that it can not be
used but by small ships. The North Elve / which by them is described to be a
deep and fair Chanel / is also clean spoiled / but in steed thereof the
South Elve is broken out again with a fair deep chanel. And the place where
yet within these few years the steeple of Huysden did stand / lies now so
far into the Sea / that Ships full laden run over it / both entering into /
and coming out of the Texel: whereby such descriptions at this time are not
only unfit / but very hurtful / if a man should rule himself by them.

This considered / I (according to my ability / for the good and benefit of
Seafaring men) have taken the Books of the aforesaid Authors in hand / to
cleanse / correct and amend them of all their faults (besides that which I have
newely gotten and collected to add unto them) as much as possible I can:
wherein I have neither spared trouble / labor nor charges / that by the aid
and furtherance of many expert and skillful Sailers / Pilots and Masters (of
whose still and knowledge I was well assured) I might describe and declare the
same / in such manner as the present work / and the necessity and worthiness
thereof requires. Lucas Johnson Wagenaer himself (not long before he dyed)
has also by writing showed many notable faults / which in his Book were
necessarily to be corrected and amended. As touching the Cards / I have
especially much bettered them / with the reaching of their Compasses very
necessary to be used / and also enlarged them / and according to the examples
of the best Cards so corrected them / that therein you not only see / how you
may sail into / and come out of all Havens and Channels / but also how far
they reach / and are in wideness and length distant from each other: which
never heretofore (be it spoken without boasting) was so perfectly and so
beneficially done for the good of Seafaring men. I have also placed all the
places of the West Seas under their right heights: but touching the East Seas /
I could not bring that to pass before this time / because we wanted the true
collection thereof / for that the same which Lucas Wagenaer writes thereof /
is false / and he contradicts himself / which may partly be perceived by that
which ensues. He writes / that the Sond lies under 56 degrees and 12 minutes
/ and Schagen under 57 degrees and 48 minutes / whereby it should follow /
(for that the said two places lie distant southeast and northwest) that they
should be distant one from the other 33 or 34 Dutch miles: whereas
notwithstanding he himself writes / that they are but 25 miles distant from
each other: but that both these positions are false / I prove it thus. The
middle of the I Will of Ween lies just under 55 degrees and 54 minutes / and
seeing that the Sond is but a mile and an half or two miles distant from thence
/ and rather westerlyer then north / then of force the Sond can not lie higher
/ then under 56 degrees: and so / if we (according to the common gessing)
reckon / from the Sond to Schagen 25 miles / then the Point of Schagen must lie
under 57 degrees and 11 or 12 minutes / which differs from Wagenaers position
almost two third parts of a degree. Or if Schagen lay under such a height as
Wagenaer writes / then Schagen and the Sond should be distant from each other
about 38 miles / which is not credible. Many such like / and (as I think)
much greater faults should be seen / if the certain truth thereof could be
found.

Besides this / I have heereunto added a Brief Institution touching the Art of
Navigation: wherein is perfectly showed / what knowledge of Astronomy is
necessary for a Seafaring man: wherein hitherto there has been much abuse
committed among them. But unnecessarie things / wherewith some Seafaring men
trouble themselves in vain / I have omitted and wholly left out: as / what the
Eccentricities / Augeas and Apogeas / the Longitude / Latitude / and the
Paralaxes of the Planets are: all which things (as also many other
Astronomicall high Speculations) have no use in Seafaring / nor can by any
means further a Seafaring man.

I have likewise omitted and forborne to write any thing of the Lengths /
which men commonly call / the East and West / whereof some men boast and vaunt
themselves / to have found great matters / and that a man may find the way
from East to West so perfectly / as from South to North: but all that which
hitherto / touching that matter is come to light / is not only unprofitable /
but also (if a man should trust thereunto) both hurtful and deceitful:
whereof in the fourth part of this Book I think to write more at large / as
also / what good and benefit a Pilot may have by the Direction of the Needle /
or altering of the Compass / whereupon these new found Lengths are built /
although without ground or true foundation.

A BREEF AND SHORT INTRODVCTION FOR THE understanding of the Celestial
Sphaere, as far as it concerns the Art of Seafaring.
CHAPT. I. Of the two Poles of the World.
THe Earth with the Waters making both together a perfect and just round Globe,
the which all Mathematicians by good and infallible reas^ns confirm, as also
by experience it is found so to be. This Globe, the Everlasting and Almighty
God has firmly placed in the middle of the world, as a center or middle point
thereof, and has so placed the Heavens as a hollow Globe, with so
unmeasurable wydenes round about the same, that the distance thereof is equally
set, and separated from the earth in all places alike, like unto the compass of
a circle which is equally drawn and separated from the middle point thereof:
and has so ordained, that every 24 hours it is carried about the world: by the
which daily motion, it draws with it all the heavenly lights, as the Son,
Moon, and all the stars, the which also by that means every 24 hours are
carried round about the whole World, as it is daily seen.

This moveing or stirring of the heavens is performed upon two sure fast
points, that stand directly each against other, in such manner, as if a bale
should be turned round upon two pinnes, as upon an axeltree. So suppose that
you see a straight line stretching out from one of the aforesaid points of the
heavens to the other, like to an axeltree, the same is it that passes right
through the center, (that is through the middle of the earth) this line is
called the Axeltree of the world, and the two points aforesaid the Poles or
Axeltree points of the World, the one named the North, the other the South
Pole: Now that this may be the better understood, I will declare it by this
figure.

In this Figure A shows the Globe of the Earth, which diagram of Earth
unmoveably stands in the middle of the Heavens, which here by the Circle B C
D E is figured out. The Line that reaches from B to D going through the Earth,
signifies the Axeltree of the World, and the Points B and D are the Poles or
Axeltree points, whereof the one at B is called the North Pole, and the other
at D the South Pole, upon the which the Heavens (as I said before) every 24
hours are moved and borne round about the Earth.

CHAP. II. Of the Equinoctial Line.
THe whole circle of the Heavens is devyded into 360 degrees or steps,
whereby, by the foresaid Chapter we may perceave, that the two poles are
distant one from the other 180 degrees, that is half the circle of the Heavens.
Right in the middle between both the Poles we suppose a circle to be placed,
which we call the Equinoctial Line, or the Equator, and is so called for that
whenever the Son comes to this circle, the day and night is of one length
throughout all the World. This circle is in all places equally distant from
both the Poles of the World, to wit 90 degrees, and devideth the Heavens in two
equal parts, whereof the one reaches northward, and is called the North-part,
the other southward, and is called the South-part, as it is plainly seen in the
foresaid Globe or Figure, where you see the circle E C the Equinoctial Line,
standing just of one length from the Poles B D, deviding the Heavens into two
equal parts, as the North-part E B C, and the South-part E D C.

CHAP. III. Of the Tropikes and Zodiac.
THree and twenty degrees 31 minutes northward from the Equinoctial Line
there is a circle supposed to be, which is called Tropicus Cancri, or the
course of the Son in Cancer: for that when the Son comes by course unto
that circle, he begins to turn again toward the Equinoctial. And likewise
23 degrees 31 minutes southward from the Equin^ctiall Line, there is another
circle supposed to be, which is called Tropicus Capricorni, or the course of
the Son in Capricornus, for that when the Son in winter time comes to this
circle, he begins again to turn unto the Equinoctial. These two circles
go round about the Heavens, and are equally distant from the Equinoctial. But
how and in what manner touches the Son in his course (once in Summer and
another time in Winter) those two circles? It happens thus: we suppose a
great circle to be in the Heavens wherein the Son holds his course, which
lies thwart-wise over the Equinoctial, that is, the one half northward, the
other half southward, in such manner, that in the place where he goes most
northward from the Equinoctial Line, there he enters into Tropicus Cancri,
and where he goes most southward from the Equinoctial Line, there he enters
into Tropicus Capricorni. The two points or places where he goes or cutteth
over the Equinoctial, stand right over against each other, so that both the
Equinoctial and these two circles are divided into two equal parts, which
points are called the one, the Equinoictall in Lent, and the other the
Equinoctial in Harvest, which by the Figure enseweing more plainly appears.

Example.

diagram of Earth

Let A be the Earth, B C D the Heaven, E F C G the Equinoctial, B the
North Pole, D the South-pole, and the Line B A D the Axeltree of the World, as
aforesaid: Then the Circle K L is Tropicus Cancri, lying northward from the
Equinoctial Line, and the circle H I Tropicus Capricorni southward from the
Equinoctial Line, K F I G is the great Circle, wherein the Son has his
continual course, lying crosse-wise over the Equinoctial, reaching northward
beyond the Line to Tropicus Cancri in K and southward beyond the Line to
Tropicus Capricorni in I. The Equinoctial in Lent is F, and the Equinoctial
in Harvest is G, in the places where this Circle and the Eqvinoctiall cut or
pass through each other. This Circle is commonly called the Zodiac, although
the right name thereof is the Eclipticke Line, or the passage of the Son,
being the right middle part of the Zodiac, for the Zodiac it self is a Circle
almost 20 degrees broad, that is on each side of this Circle or passage of the
Son, 10 degrees. This Circle aforesaid is divided into 12 even parts, each
part having a proper sign belonging unto it, and every sign has 30 degrees,
so that the whole Circle (as all other Circles do) conteyneth 360 degrees. The
names of the signs are, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,
Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, and these are placed
in this manner: Aries begins where the Equator and the Zodiac cut or pass
through each other, in the Equinoctial of Lent, and follow in order as
aforesaid, so that the beginning of Cancer is just at Tropicus Cancri. Libra on
the other side, begins where the Equator and the Zodiac cut or pass
through each other again in the Equinoctial of Harvest: and the beginning of
Capricornus is just where the Zodiac or Eclipticke Line touches Tropicus
Capricorni, and so forth.

CHAP. IIII. Of the course of the Son.
IN this Zodiac or Ecliptic Line aforsayd, the middle point of the Son has
his course, without once going out of it, passing through it every year once,
that is every month through one sign, and every day almost a degree. Upon
the 20 of March stilo novo, and the 10 of March stilo vechio, when the days
and nights are just of one length throughout all the World, then the Son
enters into the Equinoctial, that is to say, into Aries, the 20 or 10 of
April he enters into Taurus, the 20 or 10 of May into Gemini, the 21 or 11 of
June into Cancer, upon Tropicus Cancri, and then he is at the farthest of his
course northward from the Equinoctial, then all those that dwell northward
from the Line have their longest day, and those that dwell southward from the
Line their shortest day. The Son holding his course, then begins to turn
again to the Line, and the 23 or 13 of Iulie enters into Leo, the 23 or 13 of
August into Virgo, and the 23 or 13 of September he comes again on the Line,
in the beginning of Libra, making the days and nights one again of one length
throughout all the World, the 23 or 13 of October he enters into Scorpio, the
22 or 12 of November into Sagittarius, and the 22 or 12 of December to Tropicus
Capricorni, in the beginning of Capricornus, then are the days longest with
them that dwell southward from the Line. The 20 or 10 of January, the Son
comes further, and enters into Aquarius, about the 18 or 8 of February into
Pisces, and the 20 or 10 of March he enters again into Aries. This ought also
to be known and marked: that this Zodiac stands unmoveably with the fixed
Stars, with the which every day he is carried about from East to West,
without alteration: and that the Son does the foresaid yearly course
contrariwise, from west to east, whereby in his daily course he is so much
hindered, that in the year he goes one time less about then the fixed Stars.

CHAP. V. Of the Declination of the Son and what it is.
THe declination of the Son is nothing else, then his departing from the
Equinoctial: or to speak more plainly, the distance or widenes that is between
the Son and the Equinoctial Line. When the Son through the aforsayd course
comes to the Equinoctial Line, then he has no declination, which happens
twice every year, that is the 20 of March and the 23 of September stilo novo,
but as soon as he is on the one or the other side of the Equinoctial, then he
has declination, and that just as much as he is gone from the Aequinoctial.
And this Declination is twofold, Northward and Southward: for when the Son is
on the north part of the Line, then his declination is Northward, and when it
is on the southpart of the Line then his declination is Southward.

CHAP. VI. How you shall find the perfect declination of the Son every day
in the year.
TO know the declination of the Son perfectly every day in the year, in
former times there were tables made which served for four years, but they
were gathered out of old and corrupt observations, so that at some times of the
year they differed almost a fourth part of a degree from the truth, as it
appears by the true calculation thereof made by the Learned Astronomer Tycho
Brahae. And therefore for the good of all Seafaring men, not without much
labor and diligence I have collected a new book of degrees for four years
out of the aforesaid Tycho Brahae breast corrected notes, just for the Meridian
(that is) after the longitude of the Low Countries, which Tables of
declinations may serve without any weighty alteration (or that can be any
hinderance unto Seafaring men) for the space of 20 years. Now to know how much
the Son in every day of the year declineth from the Equinoctial, first see
in what year and month you are, and what day of the month it is, the same
day seek in the first column, and there against it in the second column you
shall find how many degrees and minutes the Son is gone or declined from the
Equator: but to know whether it be northward or southward, you must understand,
that from the 10 of March to the 13 of September it goes on the northside from
the Line, and from the 13 of September again to the 10 of March southward from
the Line. But to know whether it is a Leap-yeare, or the first, second, or
third year from it, we have to that end placed a small Table under this
Chapter, wherein without any labor you may find it.

CHAP. VII. Of the fixed Stars, their declination, and how they may alter in
the declination, withal showing how men may easily learn to know them.
THe Declination of the Stars is almost like unto that of the Son, and is
twofold, that is Northward and Southward: those that stand Northward from the
Equinoct^all decline northward, and those that stand Southward from the
Equinoctial decline southward. But this is the difference between the
declination of the Son and of the stars, the declination of the Son
alters, and is increased or shortened every day, and the one half year
declineth northward, and the other half year southward: but the declination of
the fixed stars is otherwise, for some of them that decline northward or
southward, are always on the north or south side of the Line: and some of them
that decline northward, may decline southward, and some that decline southward
may also decline northward: but that is very long and in a great space of
time, though some of them do it with more speed, and in shorter time then the
rest; according to their situations in the Heavens. Some of them increase or
decrease a minute every three years, so that every ten or twelve years they
need correction, and some cannot alter a minute of their declination in 40 or
50 years, as may be proved by good reason drawn from the natural course and
moving of the fixed stars. The brightest, and chiefest; and most fit to be
used at Sea, we have hereafter placed, with their right declination accordig to
the year 1608, as they by the aforesaid Tycho Brahae are found and observed to
be situated. How great commodity and profit it is for a Seafaring man to have
the knowledge of the fixed Stars and their ordinary course, specially in
strange and long voyages, is well known unto all expert and skillful Pilots.
And for that in these days there are yet many Seafaring men, that have no
knowledge of the fixed Stars, we will hereafter together with their
declination, show also an easy and convenient way, readily to learn to know
them, and at all times perfectly to know when each of them enter into the
south or are at the highest, and are fit to be used. In the fourth chapter it
is showed, that the fixed Stars, go once a year about the Heavens more then
the Son, so that every day they come about 4 min. further southward, which
is every week, about half an hour, and every month two hours, which that
it may the better be understood, we will make it evident by an example taken
from the Star called Syrius, The great Dog.
or Canis major the great Dog which always follows a little after the
Image of the Giant Orion and his Girdle, which is called the three Kings,
Canis major.
which appear a little over the great Dog, it is the greatest and clearest
of all the fixed Stars, which for the most part is known unto all Seafaring
men, Syrius
his declination is southward from the Line, 16 degrees, and 11 minutes, And it
is south upon the 24 of January stilo novo, at ten of the clock at night. The
23 of February at eight of the clock at night. The 28 of March at six of the
clock at night. The 30 of April at four of the clock in the eavening. The 30
of May at two of the clock after noone. The 28 of June at twelve of the clock
at noone, even with the Son. The 28 of Iulie at ten of the clock before
noone. The 29 of August at eight of the clock before noone. The 1 of October
at six of the clock in the morning. The 2 of November at four of the clock
in the morning. The 1 of December at two of the clock in the morning. The 28
of December at twelve of the clock at night.


Whereby every man may easily reckon at what hour and time this Star is
south every day in the year, as well in the day time when you can not see it,
as in the night when we may see it. And if you desire to know the like
touching all the rest of the fixed Stars upon every day in the year, then
mark what was said before, upon what hour of the day before set down, the
great Dog comes into the south, and then by the tables hereafter following
touching the declination of the Stars, mark how long time the Star you
seek for comes into the south before or after the great Dog, and by that
means you shall find the just and perfect time that you desire.

Here follows the Table of the Declination of the fixed Stars, withal
showing at what time each of them comes into the south, and how you shall know
them.

the Star most southerly that is the clearest, comes at the highest into
the north 11 hours and 5 minutes after that Syrius is past southward, his
declination is 51 degrees, and 37 min. northward, and stands from the Pole 38
degrees and 23 minutes.

Cassiopea.

shows it self beneath the Pole in the north, as in the figure it is showed:
the first star standing in the Chair comes into the north, at the highest, 6
hours and 36 minutes before the great Dog, his declination is even 57 degrees
northward, and therefore stands from the Pole 33 degrees.

Half an hour after that follows the Breast called Schedir, Schedir.
his declination is 54 degrees, and 24 minutes, it stands therefore from the
Pole, 35 degrees and 36 minutes.

Fifteen minutes after that follows the Star upon the Hippe, which is
declined 58 degrees and 36 minutes, so that it stands from the Pole, 31
degrees, and 24 minutes.

Seven-and-twentie minutes later follows the Star upon the Knee: his
declination is 58 degrees, and 10 minutes, and stands from the Pole 31
degrees and 50 minutes.

NOTA. You must understand that whenever these aforsayd Northstarres come
into the north at the highest above the Pole: that just 12 hours after, they
come at the lowest right under it.

CHAP. VIII. How to find the hours of the night at all times of the Year.
IN the Chapter before it is showed, how a man at all times of the year shall
perfectly know at what hour the Stars, (as well by day as by night) come into
the south or the north Now it is necessary with all to know, how a man by
night shall know and find out what hour it is. Whereunto such an Instrument
as hereafter is set down is very requisite, whereof you may make the like, or
else you may prepare this for the purpose in manner hereafter following: the
undermost and greatest Rondel and piece whereon the twelve months are marked,
you must cleave upon a plain round board, so that (as in this Figure) the first
of September be set right under, and the 27 of February right over, and right
in the center or middle, make a round hole, wherein you may put a reasonable
wodden pin or coper nail, which within must be hollow like a pipe. The
other Piece whereon the hours are marked you must cleave upon another board,
or piece of pastboard, and in the middle thereof also make another hole, which
may go over the nail, and wind about it. Lastly make a Ruler of wood or
coper (as the figure shows you) with a hole also, that it may wind about the
hollow nail, but you must look that the one end of the Rule does reach or
stand right upon the middle of the hole of the hollow nail, that is, upon the
center of the whole Instrument. The Instrument being thus prepared, if you
desire to know what hour it is of the night by the Stars, then set the
tooth that points out the twelfth hour in the moveable Ro^del where the
hours stand, right upon the day of the year whereof you desire to know the
hour, and hold it fast standing in that sort: after that lift the whole
Instrument uppe on high and bow the uppermost part thereof so much toward
you, until you may see the north Star through the hollow nail: but you
must understand that the Instrument must be holden so, that the nether end of
the foot thereof marked A B may stand like a water-compas. Now when you see the
North-starre through the hole, then wind the Rule so long about until that on
the right side of the Rule, you may see the hinder wheels of the great Wagon;
which done, then the Rule will point unto the hour upon the moveable Rondell
what time of the night it is. But if it chances, that by any let or
hinderance you cannot see the great Wagon, then in steed thereof take the
middlemost and lightest of the Watchers, and do in all points as aforesaid:
but then you must know that it will be four hours and 15 minutes later then
the Rule will show it, by reason that the aforesaid wheels of the Wagon go so
much before the Watchers.

Here after follows the figure of the Night-dyall, or Nocturlabium depiction
of a nocturnal

CHAP. IX. Of the Horizon, or the Circle that boundeth the sight.
Where the Heavens and the Earth, or the Waters seem in our sight to meet
together, that is called the Horizon, or the Circle-bou^ding-the-siight,
because our sight ends there, and can go no further: by our Netherland
Sea-farers it is also called the Kimmen. This Circle devideth the Heavens just
in two even parts, so that just the one half is seen by us here above, and
the other half can not be seen by us, because it is hidden underneath us:
which happens in this manner. The Earth, (as in the first Chapter is showed)
stands as a Center in the middle of the Heavens, the which by reason of the
unmeasurable quantity or largenes thereof, is so far separated from th
Earth, that the whole thicknes of the Earth in respect of the Heavens, is no
more then a point or prick, or at least so little that it cannot be perceived
by our sight, and that which by our sight, along upon the Earth or the Water we
can comprehend (which can not reach further then about three Dutch miles, that
is ten English miles) seems in our eyes by reason the space is so little, to
be no other then an half globe falling perpendicular upon a plain, so that
our sight falls in the Heaven, as if we stood in the middle point of the
World, and saw right compasse-wise, whereby it falls out, that just the half
of the Heavens is seen by us, and the other half is not seen by us, in like
manner as if a man should lay a line over the center of a circle, then the one
half of the circle is above, and the other half is just under. All the heavenly
lights, as the Son, Moon, and Stars (by the turning of the Heavens)
coming above the Horizon are seen by us, and going down under it, go out of
our sight.

CHAP. X. Of the Meridian or Midday-circle.
THe Meridian is a circle in the Heavens, which we must conceive to pass
through both the Poles of the World, right over our heads, and crosse-wise
through the Equinoctial, and to cut through the Horizon right north and
south. The Son touching this circle is at the highest: and then it is just
noone, or the middle time of the day, and likewise the Stars when they come
upon this Circle, they are (like the Son) at the highest of the Horizon, and
right south, and as soon as they have past it they begin to go downward again.

CHAP. XI. Of the height of the Son or Stars, and what it is.
THe Height of the Snne or Stars is nothing else but the distance or space,
that is between the Horizon and the Son or Starr it self: which to
understand perfectly, you must mark, that we suppose a point or prick to be
right above our heads in the Heavens, that is equally distant from the Horizon
in all places, which point is called the Zenith, or the Head-point: Now seeing
that the whole circuit of the Heavens conteyneth 360 degrees, and that the
just half thereof is seen above the Horizon, it is certain that this point
called the Zenith in all places is above the Horizon 90 degrees, whether you
turn East, West, North, or South, or any other way: now when the Son rises
above the Horison, and ascends higher and higher from it, and comes toward
this point or Zenith, we say that as many degrees as it is ascended, from the
Horizon, toward the aforesaid point or Zenith, that the same is the height
thereof, as by example, when he is risen half up from the Horizon toward the
Zenith, then he is 45 degrees high, and if he be risen a third part from the
Horizon then he is 30 degrees high, and so forth, the like is also to be
understood of the height of the Stars.

CHAP. XII. How to measure or find the height of the Son or of the Stars.


TO find the height, the Mathematicians have devised diverse fit Instruments,
whereof there are two that are most to be used at Sea, which are the
Astrolabium, and the common Crosse-staffe, the use of the Astrolabium is plain
and well known unto all men, for holding the Instrument by the ring let the
Son shine through the holes of the ears, then the uttermost part of the
Dyall (counting from below upwards) shows how many degrees the Son is
risen above the Horizon: as the former figure plainly shows.

The Crosse-staffe is used thus, you must place the end of the Staff
underneath the eye, then you must remove the Cross to and fro, until the
upper end of the Cross stands even upon half the Son or Star, and the
under end just with the Horizon, and then the Cross will show you upon the
Staff how many degrees there are between the Horizon and the Son or Star,
that is, how many degrees they are in height, so you account after those
numbers whereof 90 stands at the end of the Staff that is next to your eye,
the computation going backward from the other end of the Staff: for otherwise
if you reckon by those numbers that proceed forward from the end next your eye,
then it will show you how many degrees, the Sone or Star stands from the
Zenith, or Head-point to the Horizon, as you may see by the figure enseuing.



CHAP. XIII. How you must make a perfect Crosse-staffe and how you shall mark
it.
THe Crosse-staves are often times made the one after the other, by imitation,
or patterns, and that many times without judgment or knowledge whether the
pattern be good or not, whereof notwithstanding a man ought to be very
certain, for it is a matter of great importance and therefore I have here set
down two several ways easy to be understood, how to make the same
exquisitely and perfectly, upon good reason and good ground.

Behold in the page following the Figure with the description thereof.

diagram

Make an even smoth board, and past good paper upon it, then darwe a straight
line upon one edge or side thereof, as you see in this figure a line marked C A
D, then make another line as you se it marcked B C, that B C A be a right and
just half square, then take a good pare of Compasses, and set one foot thereof
in the Angle marked C, and compass therewith as you see B E A, so that A E B
may be a right quadrant, or fourth-part of a circle, then devide it into two
parts, to E, and then devide the other half (which is A E) into 90 parts, or
degrees as thus: first devide it into three parts, and then devide each
third-part again into three, and then it will be divided into 9 parts, which
done, devide each of them into two parts, and those Devisions or parts
devide into five parts, and then it will be divided into 90 parts. then take a
straight line, and lay the one end thereof upon the Center C, and so forth upon
every several point, which you have divided in the Quadrant, and then draw
lines from the Center C through all the aforesaid points, as long as the board
will contain them, as you may see in this figure: which do^ne then your
Instrument is fully made and prepared to mark your Staves thereupon. Which to
do, with your Compasses take just the half length of your Cross, and set the
one foot thereof in the Center C and put the other at F, and do the like from
D right to G, which two points or pricks draw with a straight line unto each
other as you see the line F and G, and then mark where the line F G is cut
through by the lines that come out of the Center through the degrees or points
of the quadrant: for those cuttinges through, show upon the said line the right
marking of your Crosse-staffe: that is, you must mark your Staff just as you
see that these lines in F G are marked, by the lines that come out of the
Center and pass through it, whether the Cross be long or short, you must
follow the same order that you be taught, as in the Figure the line H I is
drawn for a shorter Cross then the former, and K L for one that is shorter
then that, viz. whose half is just as long as the line C K.

The second manner of framing your Crosse-staffe much excels the first in
perfectnes and curiosity, so you devide it perfectly with your Compass, which
is done in this manner. Upon an hard eve^ board which is pasted with paper
draw a straight line, as long as your Staff is, and with your Compass take
the just half of the length of your Cross, whereunto you mean to mark your
Staff, and prick it as many times along in the said line as you can: and
devide each of the said lengthes into tenne-thousand equale parts, then look
upon the table hereafter enseuing, which show you, how many of those points
or parts you shall mark for each degree, and that you must do in manner
following: from the end of the Staff, which you will make the eye-end, prick
just the half length of the Cross, and there make a cross stroke, from
whence prick for every degree so many of the aforesaid parts as the table
enseuing shows you. As for example, for the first degree prick 178 parts,
for the second 355 parts, for the third 538 parts, for the fourth 724 parts,
and so forth: Remembering that you must prick all the lengths of pricks or
parts aforesaid, from the aforesaid Cross stroke, which is marked upon the
half length of the Cross: but if you can not devide the half length of the
Cross into tenne-thou-sand parts, then devide the whole Cross so, and then
take for every degree half so many as the table shows unto you: and if you
can not do so, devide half the Cross into a thousand parts, and then leave
the two hinder letters of the table out, as where you should for the first
degree take an hundred-seventie-and-eight parts, take but 17 parts, leaving
the last figure out: but if your Crosses be so small that you can devide the
half of them into no smaller then an hundred parts, then leave out the two
last figures in the table. But you must understand that the more parts that
you devide the Crosses into, your marks will fall out so much the better and
perfecter.

CHAP. XIIII. Of the cutting of the Crosse-staffe and how a man may help and
prevent all the defects of the staff.
THere being a Crosse-staffe well and exquisitely framed, according to the
doctrine of the former chapter: it falls out that certain ignorant persons
cut off a piece from the eye-end of the Staff, about a degree, or a degree
and an half, or two degrees long, and can give no other reason of that their
doing but that it must be so, and that they have experience that it ought so to
be. But questionless seeing they prove by their experience that they do not
find their measuring with uncutt Staves perfect and right as it should be, the
fault thereof is not in the Crosse-staves uncutt, but in themselves, for that
they know not how to use the Staff aright, nor understand not the true ground
thereof. Others that will seem wiser then the former, give a reason thereof:
to wit, that the Staff must be cut, because of the hollownes of the eye, for
that otherwise the Staff cannot come to stand so that the end thereof be
conjoined to the middle point or center of the eye or sight: this reason has
some show of truth, but notwithstanding is alike untrue and erroneus: for the
Staff may very well be set, either on the innermost or outtermost corner of
the eye, so that the sight of the eye may fall to answer just to the end of the
Staff: that this is truth we will prove with good reason as follows.

Set the great Cross with the middlemost upon like degrees: to wit each
upon such as for that purpose are marked upon the Staff: then apply the
Staff (the Crosses so firmly remaining) unto your eye in such manner,
(whether it be on the innermost or uttermost corner it is all one) as that you
discern the ends of the Crosses both above and beneath just over each other,
in form as this figure specifieth. If then you draw straight lines by the
ends of the Crosses A B and D C they shall meet just in the middle point of
your sight. And inasmuch as the Crosses are placed upon like degrees, the lines
aforesaid shall meet just upon the end of the Staff; seeing that that end of
the Staff represents the center of the quadrant whereby your staff is
marked.

diagram

So then the foresaid lines or ends of the Crosses answer both just upon the
end of the Staff, and also upon the sight: so that it follows necessarily
and appears evidently, that the end of the Staff and the sight meet in one:
or to speak properly, both of them stand just in the center of the quadrant.

Therefore whenever with the Crosse-staffe you will take the height of the
Son or of any Star, then observe diligently: how many degrees it is
elevated above the Horizon: and place the two Crosses upon so many degrees:
then apply the Staff to your eye in such manner as that you may see the ends
of the Crosses just over each other, according as is taught before: in such
form then as you find the Staff to stand to your eye, shall you place the
Staff (taking away one of the Crosses) when you desire to measure according to
such height: this is a sure rule which will never fail, neither can you
possibly miss if you follow it.

CHAP. XV. Of the breadth of the Lands.
THe breadth of Lands or Countries is no other, then the distance or widenes
that is between the said Lands and the Equinoctial Line, which is reckoned
in a double manner, that is northerly and southerly, to the number of 90. Such
Lands or Countries as lie right under the Equinoctial Line have no breadth:
but such as lie northward from it, have northerly breadth, and they that lie
southerly, have southerly breadth.

Example.

The Island of S. Thomas, in the River Gaban in Guinea lies right under the
Line, and therefore has no breadth, neither northerly nor southerly.

The Cap S. Vincent in Spain lies northward from the Line 37 degrees, and
therefore the northern breadth of Cap S. Vincent is 37 degrees.

The point of Lezaret in England lies northward from the Line 50 degrees,
therefore the north breadth of Lezaret is 50 degrees.

The Cap de bona Esperance lies southward from the Line 34 degrees, therefore
the southerly breadth of Cap de bona Esperance is 34 1/^. degrees. In like
manner you must understand and reckon other Lands, Countries and Towns.

CHAP. XVI. Of the height of Lands and Countries, and what it is.
THe height and breadth of Lands and Countries although that in them selves
they are diverse things, yet they are always one like unto the other: Any
Country being situated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lies also in the
height 30 degrees, which by Seafaring men is taken without difference, but
what it is, or what it has in it or signifies few men understand, and yet it
behooves a Seafaring man, that seeks for the height of any Countries, to be
expert therein, for that no man without it can well understand how any
Instrument (whether it be Astralabium, or Crosse-staffe, no nor the
Sea-compasse it self) should well be used: for that these things are al built
upon one foundation, and like a chain hang one upon the other. But it may be
that some man will object and say, that there are many Pilots which do not well
understand such things, and yet are able to go directly unto diverse places,
whither they desire to sail: which I confess to be true: but tell me, how
many times are they deceived? how many times are they in great doubt and fear?
and how seldom dare they trust unto the height which they have taken or
reckoned, when they are to seek out any country there by? how often times has
it heretofore happened, that for want of such knowledge, ships have sailed out
of their way either behind England or upon France, which thought to pass
through the channel between England and France, and that in so short and well
known, and common sailed water, as to come out of Spain or France? what would
such men do, if they should pass the Line, and were to seek or find out
certain Islands? or that after they had sailed up and down the Seaes certain
months together, should then seek out for Land? but I am of this opinion
which I know every man will grant, that it is much better and more assured to
go a way being guided by his own eyesight, then like a blind man to be led
by another, and knows not whether that other sees well or not: but to come
again to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no other but the
height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to say, so many degrees as the
Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizo^, so much is the height of such
a Country: and this height agrees always with the breadth as aforesaid. In
the 10 chapter it is showed, that wheresoever a man goes or turns, always
the one half of the Heavens shows it self above the Horizon and the other
half is hidden from us: in the first Chapter it is said that the two Poles
stand right one against the other, whereby it is evidently to be understood,
that whenever a man being upon the earth is right under the Equinoctial
Line, that then both the Poles of the World, lie right in the Horizon, one in
the south and the other in the north: and as much as a man travaileth northward
from the Equinoctial Line, and wins breadth northerly, so much the north
Pole rises above the Horizon: and the south Pole contrary wise goes so much
under: and on the contrary, as many degrees as a man goes from the
Equinoctial Line southward, and wins breadth southward, so much the south
Pole rises above the Horizon, and the north Pole goes so much under: which
may easily be understood by the Figure hereafter following.

digram

In this figure the undermost rondel that turns about, signifies the
Heavens, N the north pole, S the south Pole, AE the Equinoctial, the uppermost
edge of the half moveable rundle, signifies the Horizon, the one half of the
Heavens is above it, and the other half just under it, the round bale in the
middle signifies the Earth, whereon you see a little man, that may be turned
upon the Earth southward and northward.

Now perfectly to mark and perceive that which is before written, that is to
know what height is, and that it always agrees with the breadth, bring the
little man upon the Earth-globe right under the Equinoctial, that is to say,
that it have no breadth, neither northward nor southward, then you shall see
that both the Poles lie just with the Horizon, and that neither of them both
are elevated above it, nor depressed under it: and with all you shall see that
they that dwell under the Equinoctial have no height or elevation of the Pole,
nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man so much northward that he goes
ten degrees upon the Earth, that is, that he comes ten degrees upon the
north beadth, you shall see that the North Pole shall be raised or elevated
ten degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the south Pole shall go
ten degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the Earth more
northerly, as thirty, forty, or fifty degrees, the north Pole will also be
so much elevated, and the south Pole to the contrary so much depressed under
the Horizon: so that if you turn the man upon the Earth to ninety degrees,
then the north Pole also will be elevated ninety degrees, that is the Pole will
stand right above his head, and the Equinoctial will join with the Horizon in
one circle: that which thus is said of the Elevating of the north Pole, is also
in the same manner to be understood of the south Pole: for if likewise you move
the man upon the Earth in the figure toward the south, the south Pole will be
elevated above the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goes southward, and
the north Pole will go so much under the Horizon.

One thing is herein to be noted, that as much as the Pole rises above the
Horizon just so much the Equinoctial goes under it, and when the Pole goe^h
under the Equinoctial rises again in equal proportion.

But above all you must mark, that the number of the Poles elevation added to
the height of the Equinoctial always make even 90 degrees; so that when the
Pole is elevated thirty degrees in the north, the Equinoctial is elevated
sixty degrees in the south: but if the south Pole be elevated above your
Horizon twenty degrees, the Equinoctial will be elevated in the north
seventie degrees, which is clearly understood and showed in this manner: we
always see half the heavens above the Horizon, (as aforesaid) which is twice
ninety degrees, from the south to the Zenith or the point just over our heads,
and from the Zenith to the Horizon in the north. Now seeing that between the
Equinoctial and the Pole there are always ninety degrees, (as is showed in
the second Chapter) it follows that that which is beneath the Pole and the
Equinoctial, makes also ninety degrees: therefore when we know the height
of the Equinoctial, and take it out of ninety, that which rests over is
always the height of the Pole. This also may be seen in the figure aforesaid.

CHAP. XVII. How to find the height of the Pole by the Son.
TO find the height of the Pole by the Son, one thing is specially to be
marked, to wit, whether you are northward or southward from the Son, whether
the Son stands northward or southward from you is easily known, when you
are in such a place upon the Earth as is far from the Line, or from the
Son, but when the Son is near almost above your head, then you can not
well see it with your eye, therefore set a compass before you, that you may
see where north and south is, then take your Astrolabium, and set it so that
the one edge thereof stand right south, and the other north, and then you shall
see at a hairs breadth, whether the Son being at the height, stands
northward or southward from the head-point or Zenith: if then you will seek
the height of the Pole, when you are on the north side of the Son, that is
when the Son is southward from you, then take the just height first, and as
much as the declination of the Son is northward, take it out of your height
and that which rests is the height of the Equinoctial in the south, With
northerly declination.
which subtracted out of ninety, (as in the former Chapter is declared) then
you have the height of the north Pole.

Example.

digram

In this figure let P be the north Pole, and G the south Pole, E H the
Equinoctial, A B the Horizon, Z the Zenith, and D the Son: let the height of
the Son B D be sixty degrees above the Horizon: the northerly declination D
E eight degrees: if then you take D E eight degrees from B D the height of the
Son, there will rest B E two-and fifty degrees, which is the height of the
Equinoctial, which taken out of ninety degrees, rests eight-and-thirtie
degrees, for the height of the north Pole A P, as in the sixteenth Chapter is
showed.

If the declination be southerly, then add it to the height aforesaid taken:
and then if the addition be less then ninety, With southerly declination.
then look upon the height of the Line in the south which taken out of 90, as
aforsaid, it leaves you the height of the north Pole.

diagram

Let the height of the Son be D B 40 degrees, the southerly declination of
the Son E D 20 degrees, then add E D 20 degrees, to D B 40 degrees, it
makes E B 60 degrees, the height of the Equinoctial, which subtracted from
90, as E G the distance between the Equinoctial and the south Pole, then
there will rest 30 for B G, that is, as much as the south Pole is gone under
the Horzion: as before is showed, so much as the one Pole is under the Horizon,
just so much is the other above it, the north Pole P shall here be elevated 30
degrees.

But if the height of the Son being added unto the declination, makes more
then 90 degrees, then you must understand, that the Equinoctial is northward
from your head just so much as the aforesaid addition is more then 90 and so
consequently the south Pole also shall be so much elevated.

Example.

Look into the figure next following, wherein let the height be D B 80
degrees, and the southerly declination E D 18 degrees, diagram then if you add
E D 18 degrees to B D 80 degrees, the height of the Son, there will be 98
degrees for B E, seeing then that from the Horizon B, to the Zenith Z (that is
the point in Heaven right above our heads) is just 90 degrees, (as in the
twelfth Chapter is taught) it follows that E the Equinoctial is eight
degrees northward from the Zenith Z, and so 82 degrees elevated in the north,
above the Horizon: when E A is taken out of 90, there rests 8 degrees for the
height of the south Pole G, above the Horizon B, then you must understand, that
you are between the Line and the Son.

How you shall find the height of the Pole, when you are southward from the
Son.
When you perceive that you are southward from the Son, that is when the
Son stands northward from you, first (as beforesaid) take the height of the
Son: then if the declination be southward, With southerly declination.
take it out of your height which you have found, and then you shall have the
height of the Equinoctial, which subtracted from 90 it shows under what
height you are, southward from the Line.

Example.

Behold the figure above standing.
diagram

Let A D be the height of the Son in 64 degrees: the southerly declination E
D 16 degrees: which subtracted from AD the height of the Son, there remains
for A E 48 degrees, the height of the Equinoctial in the north, which
subtracted out of 90, then the height of the south Pole G B will be 42 degrees.

If the declination be northerly, then add it to the height found out, if then
the addition be less then ninety it shows you the height of the
Equinoctial, which taken out of 90, you find the height of the south Pole.

Example.

With northerly declination.
Look on the figure with his circles as it follows hereafter, let A D the
height of the Son in the north be 50 degrees, and D E the northerly
declination 15 degrees, then add E D 15 to D A 50 degrees, then you have 65
degrees, for A E the height of diagram of the Equinoctial, then GB the height
of the south Pole is 25 degrees, for as in the sixteenth Chapter it is showed,
the height of the Equinoctial E A with the height of the Pole G B always make
90 degrees.

But if the height and the declination of the Son added together, make more
then 90, you must then note that the Line is southward from your Zenith, as
much as that number is above 90.

Example.

Look on the figure in the page following, let the height of the Son AD in
the north be 84 degrees, the declination E D 21 degrees, add them together,
then you have AE 105 degrees, which is the distance between the Equinoctial E
and the Horizon in the north: now mark that AE is 105, and P the Pole, and E
the Equinoctial are even 90 degrees from each other: then it follows that P
from A is 15 degrees, that is the height of the north Pole above the Horizon,
and so much you must be northward from the line, and you must also mark that
you are between the Line and the Son.

diagram

How you shall find the height when you are right under the Son.
Being just under the Son.
IF you understand the rules before going well then this is easy to be found.
If you be right under the Son, that is, when the Son is elevated ninety
degrees, then you are even as many degrees northward or southward from the
Line, as the Son has northerly or southerly declination.

The explication thereof.
Suppose that you find the height of the Son above the Horizon to be ninety
degrees, and that it is declined toward the north sixteen degrees, then are
you also sixteen degrees northward from the Line, and the north Pole shall be
so much elevated.

But if the Son has no declination, that is when it stands even in the
Line, then you must understand, that you are also right under the Line, and so
both the Poles are on the Horizon without any elevation.

How you shall find the height of the Son northward in such places whereas it
goes not down.
THey that in Summer sail to Moscovia, in the months May, June, and Iulie
coming about the North Cape, find that the Son at that time goes not down
there, Where the Son goes not down.
but is always above the Horizon, so that a man according to the rules
aforesaid, may not only seek the height of the Pole by the Son, when it is
highest southward, but also when it is northward at the lowest, in this manner
following. Take the height of the Son with the Crosse-staffe, when it is
lowest in the north, and add thereto the filling of the declination (which is
such a number as together with the declination make ninety, or so much as the
Son stands from the Pole) and you shall find the just height of the Pole:
or if you subtract the height of the Son from his declination then you shall
find how deep the Equinoctial is depressed northward under the Horizon, or
in the south elevated above the Horizon, which subtracted from ninety will
likewise leave the height of the Pole, both these ways I will declare apart.

Example.

diagram

Mark the Figure aforegoing, where let B D be the height of the Son above
the Horizon, in the north 7 degrees, H D the declination of the Son 20
degrees, then D P shall the filling of the declination, or the distance of the
Son from the Pole be 70 degrees: now if you add P D the filling of the
declination 70, to B D the height of the Son, you shall find 77 degrees for
B P the height of the Pole.

Another example.

If you take the height of the Son A D 7, from H D 20 the declination of the
Son there will remain 13 for H B, and so much is the Aequinoctiall in the
north depressed under the Horizon, which if you subtract out of H P 90, there
remains for A P 77, the height of the Pole as above said.

CHAP. XVIII. How you shall find the height by the Stars.
YOu must follow the same rule that is taught for the Son, touching all the
fixed Stars in the south, without any difference, you may also do the like
with all Stars hard by the north, which go round about the Pole, as the
great Wagon, the Waiters, and such like: but seeing you may do it with less
labor and trouble, I will show you the shortest and best way to do it: first
therefore it is necessary for you to know, how many degrees they stand from
the Pole, which in the table enseuing you may see.

degrees. mi. The hinder wheel of the Wagon that stands farthest north is
situated from the Pole 26 9 The hinder wheel of the Wagon that stands
farthest south is from the Pole 31 32 The forewheele most north is from the
Pole 30 48 The forewheele most south is from the Pole 34 6 The nearest horse to
the Wagon is from the Pole 31 53 The middle horse of the Wagon is from the Pole
33 0 The foremost horse of the Wagon is from the Pole 38 41 The middlemost or
clearest watcher is from the Pole 14 9 The tail of the Swanne is from the Pole
46 5 The breast of Cassiopea Schedir, is from the Pole 35 36 The clearest star
in Perseus side is from the Pole 41 36 The Goat Hircus or Capella is from the
Pole 44 29

Whenever these stars stand right above Leyen or the North-starre, then you
must subtract the declinations aforesaid: but when they come right under Leyen,
then you must add it, and so you shall have the right height.

Example.

The middlemost watcher standing right above Leyen I find to be high above the
Horizo^ 52 degrees, from whence I subtract 14 degrees 9 minutes, (for so much
he is distant from the Pole right above) then there rests 37 degrees 51
minutes. Coming to another place and finding the same Star to stand right
under the North-starre, above the Horizon 43 degrees, I add thereunto 14
degrees 9 minutes, and then I find 57 degrees 9 minutes for the height of the
Pole: in like sort you must do with the rest.

Mark.

That the declinatio^ of the Stars, which we have here and also in the
seventh chapter set down, do not agree, and fall out alike, with that which
we have set down in our Degree-bookes of Anno 1605: the reason is that these
are placed according to the year of our Lord 1608 and 1609 as it is said in
the aforesaid Chapter, but in the aforesaid Degree-bookes, they are placed
according to Anno 1600, whereby you may partly see the alteration of the
declination of the fixed Stars.

An admonition how to take the height.
THe Son and the Stars coming near unto the Horizon shine and show
themselves always to be higher then naturally they are, and you shall always
take them higher: which happens by means of the vapors and exhalatio^s,
which by reason of the heat of the Son continually rise up from the earth:
and the nearer the heavenly lights approach unto the Horizon, the more are they
marked of us, in regard that the aforesaid vapors and exhalations the nearer
they approach unto the Horizon the thicker they show, and by that means the
heavenly lights seem higher in our sight. The Son standing upon the Horizon
shines 34 min. higher in our sight then naturally he is, and the stars about
half a degrees, which they loose by little and little by rising up from the Horizo^,
the Son to 30 degrees, and the Stars to 20 degrees. high: but how much that may
import in several heights as by long and much curious observation has by the
aforesaid Tycho Brahe been found out, you shall see by these Tables following.

A table of the Sons Refraction, or rising up, by occasion of vapors or
exhalations.
The Son being high 0 degrees shines 34 minutes higher then it is indeed. 1
degrees shines 26 minutes 2 degrees shines 20 minutes 4 degrees shines 15
minutes 7 degrees shines 13 minutes 10 degrees shines 10 minutes 16 degrees
shin^th 7 minutes 23 degrees shines 3 minutes 32 degrees shines 1 minutes

A Table of the Stars refraction or rising up, by occasion of vapors or
exhalations.
The fixed Stars being high 0 degrees shine 30 minutes higher then they are
indeed. 1 degrees shine 22 minutes 2 degrees shine 15 minutes 4 degrees shine
11 minutes 7 degrees shine 8 minutes 11 degrees shine 5 minutes 15 degrees
shine 3 minutes

This is requisite to be well marked by them that sail far northward, and
find the Son nere unto the Horizon: for it may differ half a degree, if you
use it in the north at the lowest, and in the south at the highest.

This may peradventure by some (because they never heard of depiction of a tub
of water it) be rejected, and not believed: but the proof thereof is easy to
be made: he that will not believe it before he sees it, let him take a payle
or tubbe full of water, and thrust a staff aslope into it, and he shall see
that the staff will show crooked, or as it were broken, as you see it figured
here. The reason hereof is, that the end of the staff which is under the
water, by means of the water seems to lift it self higher to our sight then
it is.

If you will see and mark it better in another manner, put a piece of money, or
some thing else in an empty paile, or tubbe, and then go or step so far
back, that you loose the sight of the money, and stand still there, then let
another man fill the paile or tubbe full of water, and the piece of money will
be so much elevated or lifted up, that you shall see it a good way above the
side of the paile or tubbe, where as before you could not see it: and in such
sort the heavenly lights that are near the Horizon, by means of the vapors
and exhalations, are lifted up.

CHAP. XIX. Of the North-starre, and how you shall find the Height thereby.
AL fixed Stars as in the seventh Chapter is declared, with the time do alter
their declination, some increase, and some deminish, one more the^ the other,
the North-starre at this time is one of those, which is most subject to
changing, which in Anno 1600 stood from the Pole two degrees 50 minutes, and in
the year 1700 it will stand two degrees and 16 minutes, so that every three
years it comes a minute nearer unto the Pole, in Anno 1608 it stood from
the Pole two degrees 48 minutes, and thereon we have here made our reckoning,
if then you will know the height by the North-starre, when it is right under
the Pole, then you must add two degrees and 48 minutes, to the height which
shall be found by the Crosse-staffe, so it be right above the Pole (that is at
the highest) then you must subtract two degrees 48 minutes, and then you shall
have the right height, but to know when it is right under the pole at the
lowest, then look when the great Wagon stands right under the North-starre
or Leyen, if you take a lead or stick, and let it hang in your sight right upon
Leyen, and the said line or stick also hangs right between the Wagon and the
horses, then Leyen is right above the Pole at the highest: to the contrary,
when the Wagon stands above Leyen, and a Line is hanged between the Wagon and
the horses, and hangs right over Leyen, then Leyen is right under the Pole at
the lowest. This also may be marked by the Star that stands in the breast of
Cassiopea, for when it stands right under Leyen, then Leyen is right under
the Pole at the lowest, and when it is right above Leyen, then Leyen is at the
highest above the Pole. But to know the Stars that are in the breast of
Cassiopea, you must understand, diagram that it the second of five or the
highest Stars that stand in Cassiopea: or if you take a staff and hold it
thwartwise, with one end right between the Wagon and the horses, and the
middle part over the north Star, then the other end will show right upon the
said Star, which stande^h in the breast of Cassiopea, which will easily be
understood by this figure.

N is the north Star: P, is the north Pole: W, is the Wagon: and C, are the
Stars of Cassiopea, whereof B, is the breast.

This is a certain and a general rule which by no means can fail and in all
places of the Earth (where we may see and use the north Star) is without any
alteration.

How you must use the North star, when you take the Watchers upon the four
chief strokes in the Compass.
AL Seafaring men commonly use the north Star when they take the Watchers
upon one of the eight-quarter strokes of the Compass, whereunto they have
certain tables to know how much the north Star stands upon every stroke
of the compass either under or above the Pole, that is how many they shall
add or subtract to or from each Star. In most part or the books made for
Seafaring it is showed, that when the Watchers stand in the east, that then the
North Star stands beneath the Pole a degree and an half, some say a degree
and 40 minutes: and again when the Watchers stand in the west, that then the
North Star stands as much (that is a degree and an half) above the Pole.
Now if East and West were used and understood by Seafaring men; when the
middlemost Watcher is just East and West with the North-starre, and that
generally in all heights and places without any difference, certainly they
should be much deceived by such rule and custom, for such working is not
general, but in each height several, and so working in that manner they must
use several tables. The North-starre is always more under the Pole when the
Watchers stand in the east, then he is above the Pole when the Watchers stand
in the west, as in the table following you may see, being about the
Equinoctial it should not differ much, but there a man can not use it: but as
soon as you sail northward, and leave the Equinoctial Line, then it begins
to alter, and the more northerly that you go, the more it differs, so that
at last, before you come to the height of 80 degrees, and that the Watchers
come to stand in the west, the North Star is a great deal under the Pole,
how much this may differ upon one str^ke, it may be reckoned by this example.
When you are under the height of 20 degrees, and that the Watchers stand in the
west, that is when the middlemost Watcher in the west, stands just as high
above the Horizon as the North-starre, then the North-starre shall stand above
the Pole one degree and two minutes: but comeing under the height of 80
degrees, and that the middlemost Watcher stands in the west just as high as
the North-starre, then the North-starre shall stand 35 minutes beneath the
Pole, which with the former differs very near two whole degrees, and that
upon one stroke. And although two such places are far distant one from the
other, notwithstanding hereby it may easily be perceived and understood by men
of judgment that this alteration, as you sail from the one place unto the
other, by little and little increases. Many men herein note a great difference,
because thereby they cannot guess right, and yet can not understand what the
cause thereof is, so that some of them to mend it cut off a piece of their
Crosse-staffe, others make themselves tables according to their own fantasies,
one thus much, the other so much, yet without any ground or understanding, so
that in their need, they dare not trust to the^r own doings. Others for this
cause wholly reject the North-starre, esteeming it altogether unfit to take the
height by: but that is done for want of understa^ding, for having good tables
to that purpose it is as fit for use as any other starr, and to the end that
me^ should use it with good security, without any fault, I have (for the good
of al seafaring men) to that end collected, and (notwithout great labor)
perfectly made a new table, wherein men may truly see, how without any fault
they may use the North-star by the 4 chief points of the Compass, that is,
South, North, East and West, the rest of the points or strokes, to wete,
northwest, southeast, southwest, and northeast, I leave out wittingly and
willingly, for a man can not place any certain mark, whereby they may make a
just guess, whenever the watchers stand upon those strokes, so that for that
cause they are subject to more falsehood, and therefore it is thought good that
men should not use them.

How much the North-starre goes under or above the Pole, when you set the
Watchers upon the four principal points of the Compass, and that upon
different heights.
Upon the height of 10 degrees.
When the watchers stand in the east, then the Northstarre is under the Pole 1
degree 30 minutes.

When the watchers stand in the north then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees
23 minutes.

When the watchers stand in the west then Leyen is above the Pole 1 degree 25
minutes.

When the watchers stand in the south then the North-starre is above the Pole 2
degrees 24 minutes.

Upon the height of 20 degrees.
When the watchers stand in the east then the North-starr is under the Pole 1
degree 33 minutes.

When the watchers stand north then Leyen is under the Pole 2 degrees 23
minutes.

When the watchers stand west then Leyen is above the Pole 1 degree 21 minutes.

When the Watchers stand south then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 24
minutes.

Upon the height of 30 degrees.
When the watchers stand east then Leyen is beneath the Pole 1 degree 37
minutes.

When the watchers stand north then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 23
minutes.

When the watchers stand west, then Leyen is above the Pole 1 degree 16 minutes.

When the watchers stand south then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 24
minutes.

Upon the height of 40 degrees.
When the watchers stand east, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 1 degree 41
minutes.

When the watchers stand north, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 23
minutes.

When the watchers stand west, then Leyen is above the Pole 1 degree 11 minutes.

When the watchers stand south, then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 24
minutes.

Upon the height of 50 degrees.
When the watchers stand east, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 1 degrees 47
minutes.

When the watchers stand north, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 22
minutes.

When the watchers stand west, then Leyen is above the Pole 1 degrees 4 minutes.

When the watchers stand south, then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 25
minutes.

Upon the height of 60 degrees.
When the watchers stand east then Leyen is beneath the Pole 1 degrees 55
minutes.

When the watchers stand north then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 21
minutes.

When the watchers stand west then Leyen is above the Pole 53 minutes.

When the watchers stand south then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 26
minutes.

Upon the height of 70 degrees.
When the watchers stand east, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 8
minutes.

When the watchers stand north then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 20
minutes.

When the watchers stand west then Leyen is above the Pole 32 minutes.

When the watchers stand south then Leyen is above the Pole 2 degrees 27
minutes.

Upon the height of 80 degrees.
When the watchers stand east, then Leyen is beneath the Pole 2 degrees 37
minutes.

When the watchers stand north then Leyen is beneath the Pole two degrees 17
minutes.

When the watchers stand west then Leyen is beneath the Pole 35 minutes.

When the watchers stand south, then Leyen is above the Pole two degrees 30
minutes.

These certain and true rules being well understood, every man may easily
guess, how he shall deal with other heights that fall between those heights
before set down: as for example, if you will know how much the North-starre
stands beneath the Pole, when the watchers stand east, at the height of 45
degrees, first look how much it is at the height of 50 degrees, and you shall
find 1 degree 47 minutes, and then at the height of 40 degrees, and you shall
find 1 degree 41 minutes, and for that 45 minutes is the middle height
between 50 and 40, take the middlemost between 47 and 41, and you shall have
one degree 44 minutes, and so much shall Leyen stand beneath the Pole, when the
watchers stand in the east, at the height of 45 degrees, in like sort you must do
for all other places, and you shall fail little or nothing

NOTE. That when it is here said, When the watchers stand in the east, you
must thereby understand, when the middlemost or clearest of the watchers
stands east, as high above the Horizon, as the North-starre, as the like is
said of the watchers standing in the west, you must thereby understand, when
the middlemost of the watchers stands west even as high as Leyen: and when it
is said when the watchers stand north, thereby is meant, when the middlemost
watcher stands right above Leyen: and in the south, that is right under
Leyen: for, for all such measures and taking of heights, these tables are just
and perfectly made, and so are they most assuredly to be reckoned upon the
strokes of the compass.

CHAP. XX. How many leagues a man may sail upon every stroke before he win
or loose a degree in height, and also how many leagues you are then without the
Meridian or south and north line from which you sailed.
When you sail rightsouth or north, then you sail for a degree 20 leagues.
And you stay under the same Meridian, that is, you go neither more easterly
nor westerly then at first you did. Upon the stroke of south and by west, or
north and by west, you sail for a degree 20 leagues And then you have left the
Meridian or the south and north Line, under which you were at the first 4
leagues. South-south-west, and n.n.e. you sail for a degree 21 leagues.
And then you are out of the aforesaid Line 8 leagues. South w. by south, and
n.e. by n. you sail for a degrees. 24 leagues.
And without the Meridian 12 leagues. South-west and north-east for one degree
28 leagues.
And without the Meridian 20 leagues. S.w. by w. and n.e. by n. you sail for
one degree 36 leagues.
Then you are without the Meridian 29 leagues. W.s.w. and e.n.e. you sail for
a degree 52 leagues.
Then you are without the Meridian 48 leagues. W. by south, and east by n. you
sail for a degree 103 leagues.
And then you are without the Meridian 100 leagues. Sailing east or west you
neither win nor loose, but you keep always in one height.
CHAP. XXI. What is necessary for a Seafaring man or Pilot further to know,
together with an instruction to all young Seafaring men, that desire to be good
Pilots.
THese aforesaid rules although that they are so necessary and needful for a
Pilote to know, that without the knowledge of them he can be no good Pilot, to
go any long voyage, yet are they not sufficient to make a good Pilot, that is
al are not good Pilots that understand them well. For first a good Pilot must
besides them be expert at Sea, as the principal thing, which no man can learn
by any speculation, but by his own experience, and dealing in time he shall
obtain it, whereby he shall know perfectly to dispose al things that occur in
the art of Navigation. It is most necessary and convenient for him to know
the Lands, and how they lie to Sea-ward, how f^rre, and upon what strokes of
the compass, the Points, Havens, and Rivers, are distant one from the other,
and specially he must be perfect in reckoning his Tides, that he may know
every where what Moon makes an high water in that place, that when he would
enter into any Haven or place, where he can not get in at a low water, then he
may stay till it be half flood, or till it be high water, as time serves, that
he may sail in, and save both ship and goods. It is also very necessary for
him to know how the Ebbes and Floods fall out, whether it be along by, or
against the Land, thereby to know when the wind is strong, whether he may lie
in the stream, or go against the stream, thereby to know whether it will be
any hinderance or furtherance unto him, whereon many times there consists
much. And also when a man is in the wind, whether it be in the North-sea under
England, Holland, Flanders, or in the Chanel of the sea, under England, that he
should know how to set his tides and course, that he might stop his tides.
All these things old experienced Pilots, ought willingly to show and learn
young men that are desirous and zealous to learn the art of Seafaring, and not
to hide any such thing from them, as some men do without reason, who go out
of the way with their Instruments, as Crosse-staves, Astrolabium and
Compasses, and will not suffer the common sailors to see their work. This by
some is done upon pride and unwillingnes, because they would keep the art and
knowledge only to themselves, and by some because they understand not their
proceedings well, and therefore are in fear to be shamed, but let not young
Seafaring men, and such as are desirous to know the art and cunning of
Seafaring, for that cause leave off their study therein, and to that end when
you sail out of any river or haven, you must reckon every course along the
reach from tonne to tonne, or from beacon to beacon, which you must keep well
and perfectly and write it in a book, and some times draw the situation in
manner of a Card, and when you begin to leave the Land, then you must take
good heed, of the Capes, Points, Towers, and other marks, and how the mouth
of the Haven reaches into the Sea, what deapth is at the entrance of the
Haven, and how deep it is both within and without, cast out your lead often
times, and let it not rest when you are in the Haven nor in the Stream,
whereby in sailing out and into the river, you shall know what countries are
flattes, or shoring that you may beware of them, and when you are a coming
without the Land, then you must earnestly mark what hills or downs lie there
aboutes, what churches, towers, castles, or other marks stand upon them, and
those you must note and counterfeit with a pe^ne upon several strokes of the
compass, as they change their form of standing by sailing along by them,
oftentimes using the lead, all which being perfectly noted, it will be a great
help unto you to know the said Lands, when you come thither again.

Likewise when you pass by any strange Country, and sail along so near by it
that you may plainly see it, then take the cou^terfeit or form thereof with a
pen, to know in what manner they show themselves upon such strokes of the
compass, and there let the lead fall, to see what depth and ground is there,
which for your memory you must also note, for that which you mark in that
manner will stay longer by you, then that which you have but simply seen, and
heard of of an other. But when you come against any Points or Havens, where
you mean to lade or unlade, there you must take good heed unto your course,
and mark how you sail by that Land or Haven, and when you see any marks or
towers, you must note them with a pen, and bring the marks and points both
well together, thereby to go right into the river, and to guide you by the
lead til you be in, and when you are within and at an anchor, then visit all
the points of the Haven, and note them down with a pen cardewise, how they
reach outward and inward, that when you come thither again, you might enter
into the same place again, and know the situation thereof, but when you are
in the open Sea, and the wind against you so that you lie by the wind, both
on the one side and the other, then you must mark how long you must lie on the
one bought or on the other, and when you must turn. Besides this you must
specially note how much the ship goes forward, and what you may sail in one
meal, and how the ship lies, to the which end you shall some times let the
lead, or the lead line with a piece of wood hang out behind, to see how much
the ship windeth, and how much the waves casts it out of the right course
that it should hold. This you must do upon your compass every evening and
morning, and note it in your memorial, that you may cast it over and peruse it
again in the Cards, whether in noting or marking it, you should have chanced
to have mistaken your self. You must likewise take heed to your steering, to
see how much you must wind on either side in your Card. And further when you
find a good and sure height, by your Crosse-staffe or Astrolabium, that will
give you a good security of your right gessing, so that your compassing
agrees also with it, and then you shall certainly see in your Card how all
points and Countries lie from you, but if your gessing and your height agree
not together, then you must warily correct your gessing according to your
height, and see as near as you can whether you fail either to little or to much
in your gessing, and all this must be done with good skill and understanding in
your Card, and when you come to the place where you will seek for Land, then
without doubt you shall land in such a place as your Instrument and good
gessing show you.

To learn to know all courses and strokes perfectly by heart, to that end you
must take the printed Card and read it oftentimes over, and every course and
stroke which you find to meet you must place together: as from Cape Finistere
to Cisarga, the West-coast of England, the Coast of Flanders, the Coast of
Freesland, of Hartshals to Schagen and such like. The like you must do with
the tides, to wete, you must note all the places (where the Moon makes a high
water upon any point or stroke of the Compass) by each other in a Register, as
in the table of the tides hereafter enseuing you may see: and he that does so,
without doubt shall do all things right and perfectly, and shall bear about
him all the experience, and knowledge of Seafaring, needful and necessary,
which no man in the world can take from, or bereave him of.

CHAP. XXII. Of the Water-tydes and how a man shall reckon them perfectly by
the Moon.
We have hereunto added certain tables of the Water-tydes, as they are
commonly used by Pilots, wherein is showed upon what points or strokes of the
Compass the Moon must be, before it makes a high water in any of the places
set down in the tables, but you must understand, that you must not take or
reckon such strokes or points according to our common Compass lying flat, or
driving water-compasse, but only the north and south points, for they must be
esteemed not after the Horizon or Kimmen, but according to the flat or
superficial part of the Aequinoctiall. Therefore if you will take the Son or
Moon by or with the common Compass, then you must lift up the side of the
Compass so much, that the corner thereof may stand right against the
Aequinoctiall, and that the pin in the middle shows right to the Pole, and
so you may take the Son or Moon thereafter, which will be a great difference
from a Compass that lies flat: for at the height of fifty degrees, or
there aboutes, and the Son being in Cancer, in his highest sign, that is in
the highest declination, it will be half an hour before eight of the clock
before it comes into the East, and half an hour before five before it come
into the West. If you take it by a flat Compass, that is he goes from East
to West in nine hours, and again from West to East in 15 hours. At the
height of thirty degrees, he comes first a little before half an hour past
nine into the East, and a little before half an hour past two into the West, so
that in less then five hours and an half he goes from East to West, and full
eighteen hours and an half before he comes again from West to East: and
seeing that the Moon some times makes his declination five degrees more
northerly then the Son, so it may chance that the Moon may go an hour and
more faster from the East into the West then the Son, so that he that will
alwaise take the Son or Moon by our common Compass, shall often times much
deceive him self if he should reckon his tides thereafter, whether it were
requisite to stop any tides, or to enter into any havens: to prevent that, I
have in the tables enseuing noted upon what hour and minute the Moon comes
upon such points, whereby the floodes are ruled, wherein only it is
necessary to know the age of the Moon, that is how many tides are past from
the time of the new or full Moon, for the first part of the table shows the
age of the Moon every day, that is how many days are past since the new or
full Moon. The second part of the table shows the hour and minutes when the
Moon upon the same days comes to the same stroke, as you may see on the
top thereof, and right against it stands the places where the Moon then
makes a high Water. As for example the Moon being 8 days old, I would know
when it will be southwest or northeast, then I look for the point of
southwest, and in the first column of cyfers standing under it, I tell eight
downwards, or look into the place where 8 stands, and against it in the
second column I find 9 hours 24 minutes, and at such a time it is then high
water in the places that are noted down right against it, as at Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, etc. or there a southwest or northeast Moon makes a full Sea.

CHAP. XXIII. How you shall find the time of the new and full Moon.
THe former Tables of the Water-tydes are unprofitable and not to be used, when
the age of the Moon is not known, and therefore we have hereunto added, an
Almanac for the next ten years, one enseuing the other, wherein you may
perfectly find when it is a new or full Moon, and also the just time of the
quarters.

Which to understand, you must first know, that all Astronomers reckon the day
from one noone time to another, and to that end reckon from one noone to the
noone next after enseuing 24 hours, which custom also is observed in these
Almanacks, thereby to show the difference between forenoone and afternoon.
But to find the time of the new Moon or full Moon or of the quarters, then
note first that there are two parts of the Almanacke noted with figures, the
first showing the day of the Month standing against it whereon the Moon is
new, full or in the quarters, The second shows the hour and minutes of the
same day: which perfectly to understand I will manifest by an example.

Example.

Anno 1612 I desire to know in the month May, when it will be full Moon, to
that end I look into the Almanac of Anno 1612, in the month May, and there
I find the full Moon, upon the 14 day, at 9 of the clock 38 minutes, that is
at 9 in the night: but the new Moon in the same Month, is the 29 day, 22
hours and 33 minutes, that is so many hours after noone of that day, and
therefore if you tell from the said noone 22 hours 33 minutes, then you will
find that it shall be upon the 30 day at 10 of the clock and 33 minutes before
noone. But to know upon what day of the week it is, you must first know the
Sondayes letter for the yeere-and also with what letter every month begins.
the Sondayes letter you shall find noted under every several years
Almanac. The Leap years have 2 Sondayes or Dominicall letters, the first is
used until the 25 day of February, the other from the 25 of February unto
the end of the year, but with what letter each month begins, that you
shall find in this table enseuing.

January begins with A February D March D April G May B June E Iulie
begins with G August C September F October A November D December F

If then you will know upon what day of the week the aforesaid 14 day of May
falls, then reckon upon the line of letters standing hereunder, beginning at
the first B (because May begins with B) to the number of 14, then your
number that you reckon will end upon A: but for that Anno 1612 is a Leap
year, and has 2 Dominicall letters, to were, A and G. then (as aforesaid)
from the 25 of February you shall use the last, which in this is G. and for
that your reckoning falls upon A, that is a day after G which is Sunday, then
the 14 of May will be upon a Monday. If you look in the months of January or
October, you must reckon from the first A, for those months begin with A, and
April and June with G, and so forth.

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e,
f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b.

CHAP. XXIIII. How at all times you shall find the New Moon, or her age,
without help of any Almanac.
Whereunto it is requisite to know the Golden number, whereby you know the
Epact or Keye of the year: the Golden number rises every year one, that is
with the beginning of the year to the number of 19, so that every 19 years
it goes about, or makes an end; then again it begins at 1, 2, 3, etc. To
find it in such a year as you desire, do thus: see how many years are past
since Anno 1500, which devide by 19, and that which rests is the Golden
number, but if nothing rests, that is, that even 19 parts are produced out
of it, then your Golden number is 19.

Example.

I desire to know the Golden number Anno 1608, setting the 1500 aside, I look
how many times 19 there is in 108 years, and I find 5, and 13 remaining, which
13 is the Golden number for that year, the like must be done with all the other
years.

Of the Epact.
THe Epact or Keye of the year, alters every year upon the 1 of March next
after enseuing, rising every year 11 to the number of 30, and when it is more
then 30, then take 30 out of it, and the rest is the Epact: and so every year
reckon 11 more as aforesaid.

But the Epact of the Old Style is always 10 more then the New Style, because
the Old Style follows 10 days after the New Style: so that if you add 10
to the Epact of the New Style, then you have the Epact of the Old Style: but
if the number rises higher then 30, then leave 30 and that which remains is
the Epact of the Old Style, which you shall clearly see in the table enseuing.

How much the Epact is in every year, you may perceive by this table, namely
right against the Golden number, which to know without looking in a book, you
must do thus. Count the Golden number upon the three joyntes of your thumb,
beginning with one at the undermost joynte, and count so long until you come to
the Golden number of the year that you require, and if it ends on the
undermost joint of your thu^b then the Golden Number and the Epact is al one
number; but if it ends on the middle joint of your thumb, the^ add 10 to
your Golden number, and that will be the Epact; but if it ends upon the end
of your thumb, then you must add 20 to your Golden number, and then you shall
find the Epact.

26 6 7 7 17 8 18 28 9 29 9 10 10 20 11 21 1 12 2 12 13 13 23 14 24 4 15 5 15 16
16 26 17 27 7 18 8 18 19 19 29

Example.

I would know the Epact of Anno 1609, the Golden number for that year is 14:
now when I tell this number upon the three joints of my thumb it ends upon
the middlemost joint of my thumb, for which cause I add 10 thereunto, and it
makes 24, which is the Epact of that year, agreeing with the table aforesaid,
this is to be understood after the new Style.

Now if you will know when it is a new Moon, then take the number of the
Epact of your year, and thereunto add the number of the months since March
to the month wherein you are, accounting that therein: if the number be just
30, then it will be a new Moon upon the first day of the month, but if it be
less then 30, then know that there must want so many days of the month as
the number is less then 30, before it shall be a new Moon.

Example.

In Anno 1614 I desire to know when it shall be a new Moon, in the month of
Iulie: the Epact of that year is 19, whereunto add 5 for the months from
March, which added together makes 24, which wants 6 of 30, so that the new
Moon shall be upon the 6 day of the month of Iulie.

But if you desire to know how old the Moon is upon any day, add the Epact
and the number of the months from March; to the days that are past in the
month that you are in, and if the number be less then 30, then it will show
the age of the Moon, but if it be more then 30, then subtract 30 out of it,
and that which then remains, is the age of the Moon.

Example.

In the year 1614 aforesaid, I desire to know the age of the Moon the 28 of
Iulie, the Epact is 19, whereunto I add 5 for the months past from March, and
28 more for the days of the month that are past, which together makes 52,
from which I subtract 30, and there rests 22, and that is the age of the
Moon upon that day: that which is here alleged concerns the New Style
wholly.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Sea-cardes.
IT is well known unto every man, specially to all those that understand the
grounds of Cosmographie, that the Earth and the Sea together is a round body
or Globe, so that it is impossible in such sort to set down and show the
same, or the parts thereof in one plat form, or card, that they may be well
distinguished without error, for it is impossible to make a thing that is round
to be like in all proportions with that which is flat, so that the common
flat Sea-cardes many times in some places are untrue, specially those that
set forth great voyages, far from the Equinoctial: but the Sea-cardes that
are commonly used here aboutes for the East and West voyages by Sea, they are
reasonable true, or else the faults therein are so small, that they cannot be any
hinderance thereunto: they are most fit Instruments to be used by sea, and our
old farefathers which first practiced them did great pleasure, and profit unto
Seafaring men. The want that we find in them, consists herein, and is thus
found: If a man were to sail to a place with three points into the Sea, the
two first points might be sailed by their strokes and distances, but from the
second to the third place (that is the third side of the triple point) it will
fail both in the stretching and the distance.

Example.

I sail from the Lezard with a right course to the Islands of Canaria, and from
thence again to the Islands of Corvo and Flores, for the which two strokes and
distances my Card is well made, but if I will sail again from Corvo to Lezard
from whence I first sailed the Card will show me an imperfect course, that is
it will show farther in the Card then it is, and it shall differ also in the
stretching, so that you must set your course more northerly then the Card
shows.

In our short ways, as aforesaid, this is not much marked, and is little
esteemed, but they that sail to West India, they perceive it well enough. When
they sail outward, they hold their way far southward, and there find their
Cards just with their due lengths, because the Cards are made for the
purpose: but returning home again, when they hold their course northerly, then
they find the way to be shorter then their Cards show it. The cause thereof
is this, all the lines in flat Sea cards from south to north, are al over
drawn just even each some other, from the Equinoctial to the Pole: but upon a
round Globe, which is made in form like the Earth, they are not of alike
wideness, but the more Northerly they are, the nearer they come one to the
other, so that two strokes of south and north, at the breadth of 60 degrees,
are but half so wide one from the other as upon the Equinoctial Line, and
under the Pole they fall close together. Wherefore if two ships being under the
Equinoctial, distant from each other 200 leagues, both of them may sail right
north without let or hinderance, and they would come to the height of 60
degrees, and be but 100 leagues one from the other, and if they should hold on
the same course, they would at last meet both together under the Pole, but if
you should prick the course of those two ships in a flat Sea-carde, the
distances in the Card would remain alike, whereby it is plainly seen, that
al places in the Sea-cardes lying far northward are much to great, unles they
be drawn less, which cannot well be done, without making other places falser,
but how all such places may be made even, and helped you may see it in the
Sea-cardes of West India, which were printed and made by us.

Amongst many Pilots there is an opinion, that they had rather use the written
Cards, then such as are printed, esteeming the printed Cards to be imperfect,
and say that the written Cards are much better and perfecter, they mean the
written Cards that are daily made by men, are every day corrected, and the
printed never: but herein they are not a little deceived, for the printed Cards
in each respect are as good, yea and better then the written, for that the
printed Cards are once in every point with all care and diligence made
perfect, in regard that they serve for many, for that being once well made, all
the rest may with as little labor be made good as well as bad. But the
Sea-cardes that are written can not be made so sound nor with such speed,
because so much cost for one piece alone were to much, but are all one after
the other, with the least labor copied out, and many times by such persons
that have little or no knowledge therein. Whatsoever there is yet resting to be
corrected or made better, is as easy to be corrected in the Cards that are
printed, as in them that are written, which we also are ready to do at our
charge, if any man can by good pro show us any thing that is to be corrected
in the Cards that are printed by us.

CHAPTER I. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Stream running in the Fly, and the Tessel,
and how you must sail out of the Fly and the Tessel.
I To sail from Amsterdam and Enchuysen to the Fly.
TO sail from Amsterdam to the fall of Urck, you must sail in the middle of
the water to Tyort, and if you will sail from thence over Pampus, with a ship
that draws much water, (that is at least ten foot or more) then keep Marker
church without upon the Land of Udam, called Schyteldoecks haven, so long till
the Steeple of Zuyderwou comes even with Kinnigherbuert: which are the houses
that stand half way between Schyteldoecks haven and Diergerdam, then go
eastward to the Land, until the New church of Amsterdam joins with
Diergerdam, and keep the New-church standing so, until the church of Weesp is
even with the house of Muyen, Marks of the deepest water of Pampus.
if that the church of Muyen stands nearer then the house, keep Weesp
standing so until you see Edam without the east end of Marcken. In this chanel
it is almost a foot deeper then if you sail right through.

But to shun Muyer-sand Mariners were wont to bring the houses that were
wont to stand upon Tyort, southward of the Heyliger-stee of Amsterdam, there
by a man may make some guess, Marks of Muydersand.
and they are good long-markes: but when Monnikedam is about the west end of
Schiteldoecks haven, and the house of Muyen between Weesp and Muyen church,
then you are against Muydersand. But to sail right through over Pampus, you
must keep Diemer steeple, above or against the point of Tyort, as long as you
may see Tyort, for that is a right longmarke to sail over Pampus.

When you are right against the east end of Marken, then you must go
northeast, and somewhat more easterly to the fall of Urck, which is almost
seven leagues from thence: but when you come within a league of Urck, then you
come to a hard sand called Houtrib, which stretches southeast and northwest
cross over the water, which has no moore water upon it, then is upon the
flattes of Wieringen or Vriesland, so that you can find no deeper water upon
it then right through. Marks of the Houtrib.
When Enchuysen is northwest, and northwest-by-west from you then you are upon
the Houtrib, when Urck lies more northerly, then northeast from you, and that
you find Sand that is certainly the Houtrib, for you can not sail so by
Enchuysen sand, you are not at Enchuysen sand, before that Urck church is
southward of the buert of houses that stand upon Urck: or when the walls of
the old church stand right against the middle of the buert, then you are about
Enchuysen sand, Marks of Enchuysen sand.
then sail northwest and by west til Medenblick comes without the point of
Ven, then go west-north-west to the tonne upon Hofstede.

Between Urck and the Hofstede tonne there lies a flatt of hard sand,
reaching to the end of Enchuysen sand, The flatto between Vrck and Hofstede.
which is no deeper then the Vries-flatt: eastward about is the deepest water,
and on the west side, (which by some men is called Cat-gat) you are sooner
about the High-horne or Enchuysen sand, and it is good for ships that go not
deep: when Enchuysen steeple is southwest or more westerly from you, then you
are upon the flat.

The Crosse-markes of the tonnes both upon the Creupel and Hofstede are
Grootebroeck and Hem, Marks of the tonnes between Hofstede and the Cripple.
which are two sharp steeples coming right over against each other, then also
if a sharp steeple called Warnes comes on the south side of Stavern clif,
then you have the length of these tonnes, which lie both at 3 fathom, the one
upon the east banck, the other upon the point of the Creupel, the right chanel
is here 4 fathomes and an half soft ground. Marks of Cripplesand.
When the steeple of Medenblick is northward of Medenblick house, as far as
the breadth of the house, then you have gone by and past Creupel sand, then go
to the tonne that lies by Kreil, north-west, and north-west-by-north, as the
wind and the stream is, the right Chanel here is scarce 5 fathom. But when
you come against the Kreil, in sailing out, or about the Kreil sailing in,
there lies right within the Kreil, on the north side a hard sand or flat
called South-Kreil, which reaches along toward the tonne at the Hofstede,
there at a low water it is but 9 foot deep: but between this banck and the
north wall it is 3 fathom deep, soft ground, and south or west it is 4 fathom
and an half deep. Marks of the flattes between the Kreil and the Hofstede.
The marks of this flatt are, when Mirnes a flat steeple in Friesland is right
over a long Land-house, which stands southward from Stavern church, then you
are right against the said flatt.

But the marks of the tonne that lies before Kreil are tehse when the sharp
steeple of Twisch, which stands westward from Memelick, is right against the
Corne-mill, that stands westward from Memelick, Marks of the ton at the
Creil.
and when the flat Steeple of Mirnes is against the south side or east side
of the Clif, then you are at the tonne which lies at the Kreil, and the
Channel is there 4 fathom and an half, and 5 fathom soft ground. But the
to^ne lies upon 4 fathom, and when necessity compels you, you may sail a
cables length eastward about, then from the tonne at the Kreil, to the tonne at
the Freese Plact, the course is north and by east, when Twisck is right north
from Memelick, then keep the steeple standing so, as long as you can see it,
and so you shall not sail upon any shallowes between the Plaet and the Kreil.

Between the tonne at the Kreil, and the Freese Plaet, on the west shore there
lies a hard sand called Monicksand, Monicsa^d.
which you may shun well, when you are some what out of the way, but when you
are about the Kreil, then you must go north and by east, right through over
the point of Breesand, to the tonne lying west from Worcum, with a ship that
draws not much water, but the right Channel is deeper as follows.

If you sail with a ship that draws much water, over the Frees-flatte, then
set the flat steeple of Pandraghen (standing west of Worcum) so, Marks of the
ton at the Frees-plaet.
that it may stand west from the houses that lie westward from Worcum, that is
a good Long-marke for the tonne that lies at the Frees-Plaet. If you have a
ship that draws much water, then go eastward of the tonne about the Freese
Plate, for there is more water then westward. When Warnes and Mirnes are right
over against each other northward from Stavern then you have the length of this
tonne, and when you are past this tonne, then go north-north-east, so long,
till Pandraghen comes between the buert of houses and Voorwold, if then the
Cliffe stands right upon Stavern, there you have the deepest water upon the
dryest place of the flat, Deepest water at the Vlack.
then go some what more northerly to the tonne that lies at the bought, for
eastward of this to^ne it is al flatt water to Freesland. The Long-marks of
this To^ne at the bought are, Marks of the tonne at the bocht.
when Pandraghen is right against Voorwolde, which is a steeple that stands
westward from Worcum on the water side, you may sail by this tonne on the east
side, and if you have a ship that draws much water, then you must go close
west by the tonne, that you may not sail by the point of Breesand, which
comes from the west banck. These are the Marks of the deepest water upon the
dryest part of the flatt: when the Newland, which is a sharp steeple standing
by Bolsweert, comes between Voorwold aforesaid, and the aforesaid village or
buert of houses: Marks of the deepest water on the Flat.
the old Crosse-markes of the tonne at the bought are, Mirnes, Molqueren,
Hemelum, and some long buert of houses, when these four stand together, then
you have the length of this tonne, which lies upon 14 foot, and between these
two tonnes, that is the tonne at the Frees-plact, and that at the bought is the
dryest of the flat. Now when the tonne at the bought is sidewaies on you,
then go north and by west, and some what more westerly, to the tonne lying
west from Worcum: which lies upon these marks. Marks of the ton bewest
Worcum.
There stands a sharp steeple far within the Land called Harich, when it is
right over certain buert-houses which lie northward of Hinloopen called
Dertwisch, there this tonne lies upon the east wall, at 16 foot low water, and
the right depth there against it, is full 3 fathom. The old marks are two
villages nearest to Mackum, which stand north-east from you, and come through
each other, and stand upon the water side, and when they are a little through
each other, then you shall see two little steeples some what northerly from
Bolsweert, which come within very little one hard by the other, in manner as
the other stand separated that stand upon the water side, the one is called
Idsega houses. The Cros-marks are these, Crosse-markes.
there stands a high house on the east end of Condom, which comes within a
windbomes length near to the south end of Hinlopen, and when that house
comes on the south end of Hinlopen, the^ you are to near the cast banck, and
when it stands the length of a cable or more from Hinlopen, then you are to
near to the west shore, these are the marks of the tonne, at west from
Worcum. From thence to the tonne at Iglepoint the course is north: the marks
thereof are these, there stands a sharp steeple called Lutgeest, with a long
village cross from you, when that steeple is within the innermost gap of the
long village, Marks of the ton at Iglehooke
then you are against the tonne, and that is a good cross mark, but the
longmarkes are, when the sharp steeple of Pingom is right against the flat
steeple of Corenwaert, standing upon the water side, and Pandraghen is right
against a little house which stands northward from the village with the gap,
or when the milles of Stavern stand between the town and the bulwark of
Stavern, these are all good Long-markes of the tonne at Igelhooke, and this
tonne when you sail outward, may be sailed by on the east side, and so you may
come northward of the middle ground again into the Vlie-streame, but not with
great ships.

From Iglehooke to the Middle ground, the course is north and south, and the
right depth in the Middle ground is 7 fathom, but in the channel between west
of Worcum and the Middle ground it is 4 fathom deep good ground, Marks of
the boy at the Middlegrou^d.
and the east wall is flat and the west is shoring. The tonne of the middle
ground lies upon these marks, when the two sharp steeples which stand
northeast or there aboutes from you (that is Arum and Pingom) are both one
against the other, then you have the length of this tonne, or when Bolswert is
right north with a house that stands north from Mackum, these are good
Crosse-markes of the middle ground: Long-markes are these, when Kinswaert (that
is the Looper) is right behind Surich church, then you are right in the
channel. This Surich church stands on the water side upon a point of land
about northeast and by north from you, or when the flat steeple of Wynaldum or
Wynaem which stands north from Harlinghen, shows between Mildum and
Harlinghen, then you are right in the middle ground, and unto which side
Winaldum stands nearest, unto that shore are you nearest: Wynaldum must stand
between the east end of Harlinghen and Mildum, but Mildum nearest: this is a
right Longmarke. The right chanel in Middlegrond is 7 fathom as aforesaid, and
both the sides or grounds are shoring.

When you are through the Middleground and will sail outward to the Vlie, you
must not sail by any points of sand on the west along to Monick Slot, Middle
plaet.
but you must not go nearer to the west shore between the Middle ground and
Swanebalgh, then three fathom deep: and from Swanebalgh forward (going
outward) you must not go nearer then 4 fathom, and you must be diligent to
cast out your lead, specially when you come against Schieringshals, but when
you come out of the Sea homewards you may sail under the west shore, as it
shall hereafter be declared.

When you come in out of the Sea, you may sail by the ton that lies at the
Middleground, for there is a flat called Middle flat, which you may sail
eastward about, and so come southward of the ton to Iglehooke again into the
Vlie-streame but not with great ships, Dominicus plaet.
this Middle plaet lies on the east shore, on the west shore also you sail by
a flat, called Dominicus flat, before you come to the Middle ground, which is
also called the point of the Waert, or Doode balgh, and upon it there stands
a row of beakons: northward from this Flat there is a good Rode, right over
against the tonne at Swanebalgh: for there you have shallowe water and little
streams. When you are past the tonne or boy of Middle ground, Marks of the
ton at Swanbalgh.
then go n. n. w. to the tonne at Swanebalgh. The Crosse-markes of this tonne
are, when Bolswaert is right over a small short house, which stands southward
of Cornwaert, then you have the length of this tonne, and here you may sail by
a point of sand when you go outward. This tonne lies at 3 fathom on the east
wall, and on the west wall you may cast out your lead and find 4 fathom water
all along to Schieringshals. When you are inward, then keep on the cast shore
with a fore-flood, Marks of the long reach.
for it would draw you into this shelf before you were aware of it. The marks
to sail along by this long reach are these: you may see Mackum with a mill on
the waterside, which lies southeast from you, and southward from Mackum there
is a village with a flat steeple called Idsegahuysen. Now when Pandraghen
comes between Mackum and this village, you need not fear the point of sand
or Doodebaigh, but if Pandraghen be nearest to Idsegahuysen, the^ you are to
near to the point of sand aforesaid, but if Pandragen be nearest to Mackum
then you are to near the cast wall, these marks hold in this sort, as long as
you can see them.

From the tonne at Swanbalgh to Schuytesandt, the course is northwest, and
something more northerly: The tonne at Schuytesand.
When Wynaldum is right against the point of Harlingen, then you have the
length of the tonne of Schuytesand. The Long-markes are these, Bolsworth
comes northward of the Sluys which stands northward of Woens, and this
tonne lies at six fathom on the east shore, and there it is very shoring,
the right depth is 7 and 8 fathom, you may sound four or five fathom on the
west shore, but the east ground is shoring.

From Schuytsand to Kaeshooke the course is west-north-west, and east
southeast, and sometimes northwest and by west, as the wind and stream is:
for in this long reach there goes but half tides along the deep, and then
they go about with the Moon, and fall almost cross the deep, Marks of the
ton at Kaespoint.
or channel. The marks of the tonne at Kaeshooke are, when Franicker steeple
comes between the mill and the town of Harlingen, and comes also in the
haven of Harlingen, or upon the mastes of the ships which lie in the haven.
This tonne lies on the east wall at 5 fathom, you must shun the innermost
point of Kaeshooke a little, both coming in and going out, the right channel is
here aboutes 9 or 10 fathom deep.

Old Vlie
A little westward from Kaeshooke lies the old Fly, and stretches it self
toward the to^ne at the Nesse in the Tessel stream. The forestood is very
hard at the entering into this chanel, and you may sail from the Sea inward at
4 fathom, Marks of the old Vlie.
it reaches southward in: when Franicker steeple is right north from the
steeple of Harlingen then you are right against the old Fly, which lies on
the west shore, and is shoring all along to the Fly.

Wolfshook
From Kaeshooke to Wolfshooke the course is northwest by north, the tonne lies
at 4 fathom on the east side, between them there lies a new shoring dry
point, whereat there lies a tonne. To sail from Kaeshooke to Wolfshooke first
go north-west and by north, or north-west to get above this tonne, and after
that northwest, or north-and-by-west, to the tonne at Wolfshooke, here it is
best that you keep toward the west wall to shun the shallowe point
aforesaid. The Inschot.
When you are past the tonne at Wolfshooke, take heed of the Inschot or
Creek, for there the fore flood runs in very strongly: it is wide and
broad, and it is there as deep as in the chanel, when you come in from the
Sea, you may sail by it at 9 or 10 fathom, it goes in northward from the
to^ne at Wolfshooke: you must also beware of the fore-ebbe, for that comes
very strongly out of the Inschot upon Schiernigshals, whereby many a ship is
cast away.

From the tonne at Wolfshooke to the tonne of Schieringshals sail
north-north-west, and north-west-by-north, as the wind and stream serves:
for as I said before, the fore-ebbe falls out of the Inschot very strongly
upon Schieringshals, and the fore flood very strongly from Schieringshals into
the Inschot. Scheringshals.
Schiringshals is a point of sand which shoots out from the west wall, which,
as you come in from the Sea, you may sail by at 6 fathom, commonly there
lies a white tonne at it: when you sail in this reach, look well to the
stream, and to your course that you be not driven into the Inschot nor upon
Schieringshals, the right deep between Wolfshooke and Schieringshals is 10 11
and 12 fathom.

From Schieringshals to Longhesand Longsand.
the course is northwest, and northwest and by north. Between Schieringshals
and Longesand is the best Rode in all the Fly stream, Freese or Pompers Rode.
you go by the west wall at low water, and there goes a little stream, the
tonne lies at 5 fathom, the right depth is 6 and 7 fathom. When you come in
from Sea, you may sail by Longesand on the east side, and by Schieringshals on
the west side, and if you keep at 7 fathom, you can take no hurt on neither
side.

From Longhesand to the Monicke slote the course is north-north-west. Upon
Vlieland there was wont to stand two Capes that were one against the other, and
men were wont to sail that Reach up and down to Wolfshooke, but now they are
broken off. The marks of the tonne at Longsand are these: The tonne at
Longsand.
when the high beakon of lettingh comes over the Island of Grind, then you
have the length of the tonne at Longsand.

When you come from Schieringshals and will go to Monickslote, then you see
the milles upon the Vlieland stand in the middle right against a low flat
down, which shows some what black, for it is full of heath. Marks to sail
from Schieringshals to Monickeslote.
Keep the milles standing right against it, and sail upon it, and so you can
not fail: but if the milles stand on the east side of the downs, then you are
to near the west wall, and when the milles are nearer the west end of the
downs, then you are to near the east wall: this is a right Long-marke from
Schieringshals to Monickslote.

II. How you must sail from Enchuysen to the Vlie and to the Tessel.
FRom the east end of Marcken to the south channel of Enchuysen, the course is
north and by east five leagues. The chanel reaches about south and north. The
south channel of Enchuysen
When you will enter into the south channel, then set the mast with the tonne
right upon the west blockehouse or steeple, and sail right upon it, till
Greatbrooke steeple be right against the mill, which is in the middle between
Brookhaven and the Streecke, and then you are right against the uttermost
tonne: then sail inward along by the tonne, to the south Dyke, and from thence
along before the town. In the south channel you have 8 foot water, in the Rode
before Enchuysen it is 3 fathom and a foot deep at low water. When Broocke
is right against Broockehaven, then you are right against the north end of the
Trindel, which is a sand of 3 foot deep low water, which runs along from
the Dyke toward Leeck, and when Wynesser Wierdyke is without the point of
Leeck, then you are at the south end of the Trindel. You may pass between
the Dyke and this sand at 5 foot low water.

The north chanel of Enchuysen.
But to sail out through the north chanel, then go from the Rode to the beakon
north and by east; and then you shall find the innermost tonne, which lies
upon these marks. Groatebrooke comes upon the land house, which stands in
the boucht of the Dyke, and the tower of the town house is within a
hand-staffe of the east end of a great house, which stands in the
Breestreet. From the innermost tonne to the middlemost the course is north, and
north and by west: and lies upon these Marks: the same landhouse is right
against Boekarspel, and the tower of the town house is right upon the gavell
end of the great house, so that you may see just between them. From the
middle tonne to the north tonne in Hillegat, the course is north and north and
by west, Marks of the uttermost ton in the north channel.
and lies upon these marks: Greatbrooke is right against a low land house
which stands north from the high Hayhill which stands upon the Dyke, and
Enchuysen steeple is right cast from a high house which is in the middle of the
town, in such sort as you may see just between them, and also when the
steeple is right against a Cape which is placed there, that is the best mark,
and by that you find the uttermost tonne, when you come from the Sea, and
seek to go in at the north channel.

To sail from the uttermost tonne from Hillegat to the to^ne upon Creupel,
Marks of the tonne at Creupel
your course is north and by west, and north-north-west, according to the wind
and the stream, which lies upon these marks: Brook is right against Hem,
two sharp stteeples, as before in the description of the Vlie stream is
declared: and if you desire then to sail to the Vlie, then sail from thence
to Kreil, as in the aforesaid description I have showed. In like sort if
coming from Amsterdam through the fall of Urck, you desire to go to the
Tessel, and are at the tonne at Creupel, as aforesaid, then take the course
hereafter set down.

The tonne at Creupell lies at 3 fathom water upon the east end of Creupel
sand, and from thence to the beakon upon Creupel sand, The beakon upon
Creupel-sand.
the course is northwest, and northwest and by west; when the blunt steeple of
Lutkebrooke is right against the sharp steeple of Hem, then you have the length
of the beakon upon Creupel.

From the beakon upon Creupel sand, to the south tonne, upon Wieringer flattes,
the course is west-north-west, and north-west and by west, as the wind and
stream serves. The marks are: South ton upon Wieringhen flattes.
Grootebrooke steeple is between two Hayehilles which stand east from the
milles upon the north Dyke, that is a Longmarke. When the square steeple of
Twisch westward of Memelick is right over Almerdorp, which in times past had a
blunt steeple, but now it is fallen down, and therefore not so well to be
known, that was a right Crosse-marke. But upon Wieringhen there is a Cape set,
bring that right upon the blunt steeple on the east end of Wieringh^n, and
sail toward it, and you can not miss the south tonne: and when Westlander
steeple is over Cleverstee, (which is three or four houses standing upon the
west end of Wieringhen) then you may see the south tonne upon Wieringhen
Flattes. How to shunn the Gammels.
If you will sail over Wieringhen flattes when you sail outward, then note,
that if Twisch first comes upon Almerdorp, then you are to near the Gammels,
but if Cleverstee first come upon Westlander church then you are to near
Breesand. These are sure marks when there are no tonnes, to sail over the
flattes.

But if you will Ancker before Wieringhen flattes, then go no nearer the
flattes, then when Twisch is between Almerdorp and Opperdoes, for when Twisch
is right against Almerdorp, then you have the length of the south tonne, as I
said before.

To sail from the south tonne to Memelick keep the five water milles the
length of a ship on the east or south side of Memelick, and so sail right upon
Memelick, and sailing so, To sail to Memelick.
you shall not find less then 11 or 12 foot water at half flood.

From the south tonne upon Wieringen flattes to the second tonne, the course is
northwest, and northwest and by north: but if you will sail in the deepest
water, then from the south tonne you must first sail northwest so long, til
that Ipelshover church is right against the water mill, called the Bolmill, and
then go northwest and by north to the second tonne. The second tonne lies
upon the south end of the flatt called Repel: the west channel thereof is full
2 fathom deep at low water, and hardly three fathom at high water. The
marks of the second tonne are these: when the Corne-mill of Wieringhen is
right against the open of the Oever. Right west from the middle tonne upon
Wieringhen flattes, there lies a hard sand or flatt, called the Sow, The Sow.
which reaches to the north tonne, and upon it there always stands a
beakon. That flat at the east end is very shoring. When you sail outward you
must leave it on the baghborde, and you must be very circumspect to look unto
it, for there it is not broad. Marks of the North tonne.
When you have past by the middle tonne, then go north-north-west to the north
tonne upon the Flat, and when you are right against it, then Oostlander
church and the cornemill are both right against the little chapel which stands
upon the Oever, which is a chapel covered with red tyles: and right against it
stands the beakon upon the Sow. To shu^ne the Sow.
Upon Wieringhen by the Oever there stands a watch-house, when you leave the
middle tonne, keep it standing so, that you may see between the Oever and the
watch-house, and then you shall not come near the Sow, that is a good
Long-marke for such as know it. When you come to the north to^ne, then hold
one course, until Oostlander church be north from Wierdyke of the Oever,
because of Iaepvaers Flat, Iapevaers flat.
which you must leave on starreborde, then go north and north and by west to
the beakon upon Vlieter, The Vlieter.
which stands upon the point of the Waert, where you may sail through the
Wieringher shelf. But keep the north tonne right against Memelick steeple, as
long as you can see it, and go north and by west, until you see the tonne or
the beakon upon the Nesse on the west wall, for on it there stands a beakon,
The Nes.
or else there lies a white tonne, but on the east side a black tonne before
the Balck, which in sailing up a man may sail by at 4 or 5 fathom.

If you will seek the best Road before Wieringhen Flattes, for ships that
must be lightened, then set Westlander church right against the broken church of
Strew, and there you shall find the best Rode.

When you are at the beakon or white tonne upon the Nesse, then go by degrees
westerly, that is, north-north-west, northwest and by west, and northwest to
the beakon upon Voglesand, The Beakon upon Vogelsa^d.
the west wall may be sounded with the lead at 5 6 and 7 fathom. The marks of
this reach are these, when the mill of Oostereynd (which is a buert house upon
Tessell) is right upon the cape which is made upon the dyke, Marks of
Vogelsa^d to Copevaerders Rode.
then you are in the middle of the channel, but when the milles are any thing
southward or westward from the cape, then you are by the south wall, which is
steep, so that with lavering you can come no nearer unto it the^ 8 or 9
fathom, the right deep is 10, 11, and 12 fathom, but when you are upon
Vogelsand, the south wall is flatter, but the east wall is altogether shoring,
and as soon as you perceive that it begins to dry, the^ you must wind,
otherwise you would presently be upon the wall.

When you are about Vogelsand, then keep the cape and the mil one against the
other, so long until the horn is right against certain houses, which stand a
little inward to the la^d northward from Skonse, called South-haffell, let that
stand so until you be at Copevaerders Road, Copevaerders Rode.
and there ankor where you think good, before Oosterende it is best for small
ships, for there it is flat water, and there runs the least stream, but
most ships ankor before Geest.

III. How a man shall sail from Coopevaerders Rode to Huysduynen, and out of
the mouth of the Tessell.
IF you will sail from Copevaerders Rode to Huysduynen, then go southwest to
the new deep, or go along by Tessel side at 9 and 10 fathom, till you come
to the Helder, and if you will sail out at the Spaniards gat, then go west
close by the shore, and sometimes somewhat northerly, until the capes stand
right against Huysduynen, then put to the north shore at 5 or 6 fathom water,
and so go forward, Schelvis downs.
but when the Wambus is right against a high white down, which Pilots call
Schelvis down^s, there it is flatter water, and there you may go nearer to the
north shore, at 3 or 4 fathom water, and as near as you will your self, till
you come out, for there the north points are altogether flat, but you must not
go near all the south wall of the Spaniards gat with your lead, for it is very
shoring.

If you will sail out of the Slenck, To sail out at the Slenck.
then go out by Huysduynen, as I said before, until the capes be one against
the other, then go nortdwest til the Wambus, or Sint John's Tower upon Tessel
are within a bow length of the cape, but not right against each other. As you
sail in this manner from Huysduyne^, be very wary (specially with a fore
ebb) of the south shore, for that is very shallowe, and the fore-ebbe falls
very strong south-south-west, cross over the Grounds, and falls not out at
the Spaniards gat before the Moon is about east north east. When the lop or
inner cape of Huysduynen is even with the south end of the downs, which is
called Wierendyke, then you are close by the south shore, which are good marks
for those that know them. When the cape upon Tessell, Marks of the innermost
ton.
and the Wambus are about a bow length one near an other, there you shall have
the innermost to^ne of the Slenck, the^ go west-south-west, and sometimes
somewhat more southerly, as southwest and by west, then southwest (but yet do
as you find the wind and stream to serve your turn) and leave all those
four tonnes on baghbords, for they lie all near to the east shore, you may
easily see them one after the other, the walls on either side are indifferent
flat, and in the Slenck you shall find three fathom and an half or four
fathom water at half flood. Marks of the uttermost ton.
When the milles upon Huysduynen are right against the old Kerckbuert, that is
a few houses standing above north from Kickeduyn then you are right against
the uttermost tonne and out of the chanel, then the Wambus is a bow length
westward from the cape of Tessel.

To sail out of the La^ddeepe.
But if you will sail out at the Land deep chanel, then ru^ne along by the
foot strand of Huysduynen about a bow shoot from it, and then you shall not
miss the innermost tonne, which lies upon the threshold on the west wall at
three fathom, and there it is not very broad: Upon the Tessell on the New
land there stands a house with red tyles upon it, when the church of Burgh on
Tessell is a ships length near to that red tyled house, then you hold a good
course, but if the Burgher church, and that red tyled house aforesaid, are
right over against each other, Marks of the deepest water.
then you should sail upon the west shore. Upon old Iaeps bollen, when you are
right against the entry, then the ground alters very dry, for at one cast of
the lead you shall have 15 or 16 fathom, at the second seven or eight fathom,
and at the third three fathom, and when the wind blows somewhat, you may se
the waves break on both sides, which you may pass through between them, when
you are over the entry, which continues about three or four castes of the
lead, then you have three and an half, four, and four and an half fathom
deep. Upon Huysduynen there stands a tonne upon a mast, let that be somewhat
westerly from the inner cape, which then stands about north from you, hold it
so, and then go til you be clean out of the channel, and let the tonne lie to
Seaward from you. When the myl upon Huysduynen is right against the high
Kickedownes, then you are by the third and uttermost tonne, and free of all
shallowes, and then direct your course which way you will.

IIII. How you shall sail out of the Vlie.
A tonne upon the Flat.
NOrth from the Monick-sloot there lies a Flat, and thereon there lies a
tonne, from the Sloot to the to^ne it is north-north-east. The to^ne lies at
three fathom, and when you sail out you must leave it on the starreborde, in
the channel between the Sloot and the tonne it is 10, 9, and 8 fathom deep,
and against that tonne five fathom, from this tonne upon the Flat to the
southerlyest white tonne at Speckhooke Spechook
the course is northeast, and it lies on the northwall, at twelve foot deep
at low water, but from the tonne upon the Flat to the black to^ne at
Speckhooke, the course is east-north-east, but yet as the wind and stream
serves, for with an ebb you must sail east, to get above the white tonne.
The black tonne at Speckhook lies at 3 fathom low water, or at three fathom
and an half, half stood. The chanel between them both is right against the
tonne upon the Flat three fathom, but further forward it is dryer, so that
against the white tonne it is not deeper then thirteen or fourteen foot
deep at low water. But when you are past the white tonne, then again it is
deeper, as three, four, and against the black tonne at Speckhooke five fathom
at low water, the south wall between both is flat, so that you may cast out
the lead and sound it, the white tonne aforesaid lies upon the south end of
Peter's sand, and when you sail out you must leave it on baghborde, and the
black tonne on starreborde, a man with a ship that is something flat
bottomed, may sail a little northward from the white tonne over the aforesaid
point of Peter's sand, with twelve foot deep low water, and a little northerly
from the northerlyest white tonne of Speckhooke enter again into the channel.

From the black tonne at Speckhooke, to the tonne at Hobbesand, Hobbesa^d.
the course is north-north-west, the right depth there between them both is
five, six, seven, eight and nine fathom. The tonne lies upon the point of
Hobbesand at five fathom deep low water.

Right over against the tonne at Hobbesand lies the most northerly white tonne
at Speckhooke, The north white ton at Speckhooke.
you must leave the tonne at Hobbesand on starborde, and the white tonne on
baghborde, on the west shore it is very shoring, and right north from the
aforesaid white tonne on the west shore there lies a Flat, which at low
water is clean dry. From the ton at Hobbesand to the tonne at Bos, it is
north-north-west, and that lies at five fathom at the end of the Bos. The
Bos.
The ^^ght depth between Hobbesand and the Bos, is ten, nine, and eight
fathom. The west wall is very shoring, and you must not go nearer then six
fathom to the east wall, specially with a foreflood, for it would easily
carry you behind the Bos. From the to^ne at the Bos, to the tonne at Feyhook
Feyhook.
the course is n. n. w. That is a white run, and it lies at the east end
upon the point of Peter's sand, at 3 fathom low water, when you will go out
at the north channel, then you leave it on baghborde, and then you must go
southward. But to go out at Bomekens chanel, you must leave it on starreborde,
and against it Bomekens channel is northwest, it is there 7 or 8 fathom deep
low water, and on the west wall lies Peter's sand, also a dry flat, north
from the said dry flat. Slenck through Bomekens ground.
Right west-north-west from the tonne of Fayhooke there runs a Slencke
through Bomekens ground, which at low water is about 12 foot deep, but it is
not marked or showed. The west end of Bomekens channel is very shoring, to
the end thereof, but the east shore is flat, which may be sounded with the
line northwarde from Feyehooke at 3 fathom and an half, without any hurt.
Between Feyhooke and the uttermost tonne The uttermost ton.
in Bomekens channel, there lies two tonnes more. From Feyhooke to the first
of them it is north-north-west, and that lies on the east shore, at 5 fathom,
from thence to the other, or almost to the uttermost, the course is north and
by west, and that lies in the middle of the channel at 4 fathom and an half
low water, from thence to the uttermost tonne, it is north-north east, the
uttermost tonne lies in the Sea, at 10 fathom, right without the point of the
west land or of Bomekens ground, between the uttermost tonne and the second
tonne at the entry of the channel it is 3 fathom low water. When you are at
the uttermost tonne, then the steeple of Brandaris, and the west cape of the
Schellingh are one against the other, and stand about south-east, and some what
more easterlie from you, when you sail out at that channel, and that you come
to the first tonne at Feyhooke, you may go out along by the cast land, at 3
and 3 fathom and an half, most part north-north-east, and leave the two
uttermost tonnes a good way from you on baghbord, for the east shore is
altogether flat and good to be sounded with the lead.

TO sail out at the north chanel, To sail out at the north chanel.
sail just south to the to^ne at Feyhooke, n. and by east, to the old Legger,
which lies on the south wall at 3 fathom, and the water is 4 fathom deep.
Between the tonne at Feyhooke and the Bos it is very narrow, and the Bos is
there very shoring, so that you cannot sound it, all along to the old Legger,
where it is flatter, and so it may there be founded, Petersand, or the north
wall also is very shoring. From the old Legger to the new Legger the course is
northeast and by east, and east north east, that lies also on the south shore
at two fathom and an half, the right depth against it is 3 fathom and an
half, when you come to the new Legger, A Slenck through Petersand.
then Brandaris steeple lies south-south-east from you. From the new Legger
there runs a Slencke cross through Petersand, north-north-west into the
Sea, upon the entry at low water you have 12 foot deep. There stands a
cape upon the Schellingh a little eastward by the cape of Bomekens chanel, which
is right against Brandaris, when you come to the new legger, and then it
stands with the steeple south-south-east from you, you must hold the cape so
right against Brandaris, and then go n.n.w. into the Sea, It is a fair Slenck
for flat bottomed ships, the west wall is shoring, but the east side is
flat, so that you may sound it well. But to go out of the north chanel from
the new Legger, then the course from the new Legger to the second tonne from
without inward is east-north-east, and that lies at the east end of the Bos,
at 14 foot deep low water, and in the chanel right against it it is no deeper.
From thence to the uttermost to^ne, it is e. n. e. which lies in the Sea,
right without the east point of Petersand, at 3 fathom: when you are at it,
then the most northerly cape at the Schellingh is right against Brandaris, and
then they are s. s. w. from you, and then you are out of the chanel.

BUt to go out of the Land-deepe from the Schellingh with ships that go not
very deep, To sail out of the Land-deep of the Schelligh.
then go between the to^ne at Hobbesand and the tonne at Bos, northeast to
the northwest point of the Schellingh, then sail over the point of Ielmers
Flat to 4 fathom, and being over it is again 6 and 5 fathom deep, then
sail close along by the strand of the Schellingh, Ielmers Flat.
for so you cannot do amiss, if you sail not bluntly upon the shore. The
north shore or the Bos is fine and flat, which you may sound al along at 3
fathom or 2 fathom and an half, when you come to the end of the Bos, that is
right against the second tonne of the north chanel, there it is flat, and there
is no more but 10 foot deep, but sail along out by the fore strand, til you
get to deeper water, and from thence set your course whether you will.

IF you will sail out at Stortmelck, To sail out of Stortemelck.
when you are about Boots-horne, go along by the foot-strand of the Vlieland
n. and by w. for it is very fair, or from the to^ne upon the plaet, then go
n. n. w. to the innermost tonne of Stortemelck, which lies at 3 fathom low
water, and it is therein the chanel between the plaet and the innermost tonne
at Stortmelck 5 6 and 7 fathom deep. When you come to the innermost tonne
then run north about it, and leave it on baghborde, for on the south side
there lies the foot of the northeast point of the Vlieland unto that tonne: on
the north fide of that tonne in the channel it is 4 fathom deep. When you are
past the innermost tonne, then go west and by south to the second tonne, which
lies on the north wall at 5 fathom. The right depth there on the south side
is 7 fathom. From thence outward you may sail by the strand, for it is very
fair, you may runnne along by it at 3 fathom and an half from the second
tonne to the third, that is the uttermost but one, the course is west and by
south, that lies at 4 fadome on the north wall, A tonne at Droghe-drie.
the depth against it is four fadome, this tonne is called the tonne at the
Droghe Dry. From thence to the uttermost tonne the course is west, and west
and by north, that lies in the Sea at 5 fathom, nearest to the north wall, but
you may there go somewhat northerly, for the north wall is reasonable flat,
so that you may sound it with your lead at 4 or 5 fadome. Between the
uttermost tonne and the tonne upon the Droghe Dry, it is not deeper at the
entry then 16 foot low water: when you are at the uttermost tonne, Uttermost
tonne.
then the cape and the mil upon Vlieland are one right against the other, and
are then about east-south-east, and southeast from you.

NOTE. All the depths here set down, are understood and described to be so at
low water: at half floode it is all over about half a fathom deeper, for
there it flows a fathom up and down with a daily tide,

Here follows the Card N. 2.
CHAPTER II. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts and Havens of Holland, Sealand,
and Flanders, from the Tessell to Pas of Calis, and through it.
I. To know the Tessell and Huysduynen, and how you shall reach and enter into
the Spaniards gat, and other Channels of the Tessell.
Tessell.
THe Island of Tessell lies north from Huysduynen and hat^ four churches: at the
west end thereof th e is a high sharp steeple called Wambus, ^omewhat more
inward there is a sharp steeple called Hoorn, and more north from those
churches there is a great flat steeple called Burch, and further eastward
there stands a church without a steeple called the Oogh or the Koogh, which
is covered with blewe slate, otherwise it is a long plain Island, the north
points run from the west end a good way into the Sea, on the south side
thereof the Spaniards gat or channel goes in, as hereafter it is showed.

Eyerland Eyerland.
is eastward close by the Tessel, and is fast to the Tessel, but with a high
floode it is cut off by the Sea, (which then runs over between them both)
and made an Island, it shows outwardly like a low slight small Island with
small hills, upon it there is but two houses.

Thus the Island of Tessel shows it self when it lies about east and by north
from you.

VVambus.

view of Texel

Huysduynen Huysduynen.
is a short point of Land with some white downs, whereof the greatest is
called Kyckeduyn, or Kyckersduyn. Westward they are very low and seem
nothing, so that at the last it is nothing but a plain sand on the east end,
called the Helder, there is also some downs: but between the Helder and the
high downs it is for a long way nothing else but a bare strand, at the east
end there stand two capes, and not many years since there was a steeple, but
that is gone, and the place where it stood so far in the Sea, that now the
ships sail over it. There is nothing else specially to be marked upon it: the
Tessel lies north from it, as is said before.

Thus the land of Huysduynen shows it self when it lies about southeast from
you.
view of Huisduinen

The channels of Holland Sealand and Freesland alter and change often times, as
it is well known to all Seafaring men, yet some less then others. The
Spaniards gat continues in a manner all at one stay, and in long time has
altered but very little, only that every year it reaches out further
northerly. But the other channels as the Slencke and the Land deep alter
oftentimes, and sometimes very much in a little time, and therefore they are
not to be described in such sort, as that they may serve for ever, I will here
show the situation which they now have, and thereby certefie the Reader that
all those channels are to be used with Pilots.

When you come from the west, To sail into the Spaniard^ gat.
and seek to enter into the Spaniards gat with a west wind, then go no
nearer to Holland then at 15 or 16 fathom, as your tide serves, or as the
capes stand one against the other, for not far from Keysers plaet, and right
before Spaniards gat it is 15 or 16 fathom deep, and at Pascaarte van

map of the coasts of Holland, Zeeland and Flanders one cast with the lead you
shall have 13 fathom, at another cast 10 fathom, and at the third 7 fathom.
For the Keysers Plaet is all shoring without, and that depth of 15 and 16
fathom reaches a league and an half into the Sea all at one depth. To sail
above Keysers Plaet, Keysers Plate.
then mark the three highest downs upon the Tessel, that which stands
southerly is a white down, and the two northerly are somewhat rough: that
which is most northerly is by Pilots called, Marks to shun Ke^^ers Pla^e.
the second rough down, when you keep the Wambus, or S. John's steeple upon
Tessel right north with the rough down that is most north, and so sail upon
it, then you shall not sail upon Keysers Plaet, but go right without it,
keep the marks aforesaid standing so, til you have the capes upon Huysduynen
one upon another, so that the Looper or innermost cape stands a w^nde-beames
length north from the uttermost, there you shall find the first tonne of
Spaniards gat. Kyckers down shall then stand southeast and by south from you.
To find the first tonne.
The first or uttermost tonne lies at 4 fathom and an half with half flood,
at the end of Keysers Plate, sail on the east side of the tonne, and leave it
on starreborde, for Keysers Plate is also within as well as on the outside
altogether shoring. In Spaniards gat there are four tonnes, all on the west
wall, which you must leave all on starborde as you sail into it: from the
first to the second, third, and fourth tonne it is all one course, that is
south-south-east, and from thence forward to Huysduynen southeast, but yet you
must direct your course, as wind and stream serves. For if you will sail
into the Spaniards gat with a fore flood, then you must have the wind at least
west and by south, and you must sail south before you can lie inward, ^^ing of
stream
for the fore flood falls very strong n. n. e. cross over the points, til
it be half flood, and so does the fore ebb fall f. s. w. cross over the
points til half ebb. An east and west moon make a high water without the
channel, but by the land an east-south-east, and west-north-west moon. But if
it may be stay for your tide, till that the moon be west-south-west, then you
have a good tide to sail in, for then the stream runs right into the
chanel, and likewise the ebb comes first right out of the Spaniards gat, at
the last or end of the tide. Then when you have the innermost cape standing a
capstock beams length north from the uttermost, and are at the first tonne,
then go south-south-east inward, and leave all the tonnes on starborde, and
when you are at the fourth tonne, then go southeast to the capes upon
Huysduynen, and close by the footstrand of Huysduynen inwards. The north
points are outward so shoring that at 8 or 9 fathom you shall not be a ships
length from them, but on the innerside they are very flat. When you have
gotten to the Spaniards gat, then you may cast your lead out upon the inner
side of the north points, at three fathom without any hurt: but when the
Wambus is right upon the aforesaid high white down, or eastward of it, then
put somewhat off from the wall to five or six fathom, for from the north wall
there shoots out a point which in sailing up you may pass by at four fathom
water, then go to the footstrand of Huysduynen and sail in close by it, and
if you will be at Cope vaerders Rode, then do as it is showed in the first
Chapter.

To sail in at the Land deep when you come from the south, To sail in at the
La^d deep.
then keep from the wall five fathom, and so sail along by the land, but go
no nearer to the wall then 4 fathom and an half, for a little south from the
Kyckersdowne, there comes a piece or foot of a Sand from the wall and reaches
inward to the Sea, which you may sail behind at 4 fathom. The Depth that is
after this point the Pilots call Ariaen Bergers Kille: but if you come out of
the Sea with a strong wind, then set and keep the highest of the Kyckersdowns
east-north-east from you, and sail upon it toward the wall, and coming
against the wall you shall come into the view of the uttermost tonne, Marks
of the first tonne.
and so you shall not sail by Ariaen Bergers Kille: the uttermost tonne lies
at five fathom, on the west wall, leave it lying Seaward from you, and go
right northeast all along the wall, and if it be any thing rough, then may you
see the waves break on both sides. Let the second tonne also lie on baghborde,
the third tonne also lies on the west wall upon the entry of the Land deep,
at the entry it is not very wide, but at low water it is sixteen foot
deep. Marks of the west wall.
Upon the Tessel on the new land there stands a red tyled house, now when
you come against the entry, and that the Burgh church on Tessell stands
about a ships length eastward from that red tyled house, then you are in a good
way: but if the Burgh church and the red tyled house stand one right against
another, then you are too near the west wall. So soon as you are over the
entry then you have deep water, that is seven, eight, and ten fathom, and
presently after 15 and 16 fathom, then go forward along by the footstrand of
Huysduynen inward.

The south Slenck, as it was used the years forepast, To sail in at the
Slenck.
was Anno 1607 wholly spoiled, but to sail in at the Slenck, as it lies at
this time, set the cape upon Tessell a bow length southward or eastward from
Wambus, and let them stand so, and sail right upon them, and so you go a
little westward from the first tonne right into the Slenck, when the mill upon
Huysduynen are right against the old Kerckbuert (which are certain houses
which stand alone) then you are against the outmost tonne, Marks of the first
tonne.
which lies at 4 fathom half flood. In the Slenck there are four tonnes, you
may easily see from the one to the other, sail along by the tonnes and leave
them on starborde, for they lie all on the eastwall, you shall find no less
water in the Slenck then three fathom and an half, at half blood. The Land on
either side is reasonable flat, so that you may easily found them with a
lead. From the first to^ne to the second it reaches northeast in, after that
northeast and by east, and somewhat easterlyer, and lastly east-north-east, but
look well to your stream, and direct your course according to the wind. When
you are at the innermost tonne, then the cape upon Tessell is a bow length
westward from the Wambus, then when you find deeper water go right to
Huysduynen, but beware of the south wall for it is very shoring, when you come
to Huysduynen, then go in along by the foot strand.

By Tessel strand, there was a deep also wont to run in, but now it is
gonne, The La^d-deepe of Tessell.
for now there runs a Slenck or Kill through the north points, where at a
low water it is about 2 fathom water, but it is not well to be used, but by
small ships, and by such as are very well acquainted therewith. To sail into
it take the Tessell side at 4 fathom, and so run along by it till you come
to the north point, and then you shall perceive that Slenck by the waves, for
they are on both sides of it, as the wind blows somewhat hard, there you
must run in between them both, at the dryest you shall find two fathom and
an half, at half flood, when you are over the shallowe and find deep water
again, then you may run along by the north points, at 3 or 4 fathom deep,
or right toward Huysden. This channel as I said before, is not to be used but
by such as are well skilled and acquainted therewith.

If you will go from Huysden to Coopvaerders channel or Rode, To sail from
Huysden to Copevaerders deep or Rode.
then sail from the New chanel or deep northeastward and so you shall not
sail by the land on neither side, the land on either side is very shoring, yet
you may found the Tessel side with your lead at 8 and 9 fathom without any
hurt: but the Wieringer side is so steep that at one cast of the lead you
shall have 12 and 13 fathom water, and at the second cast you shall be on
ground.

If you desire to go inward from Huysden, then from the New deep or chanel,
sail northeast or rather more easterly, To sail from Huysden to the Vlack.
as wind and stream serves, or (as I said before) along by Tessell at 8 or 9
fathom, so long until that Horn stands north from the row of houses which
stand north from the Sconce a little within the Land, called South-haffel, keep
the marks standing so, and so sail toward Vogelsand, so long till the cape on
Tessell and the mill of Oosterender are one right against the other. then
leave the aforesaid marks of Horn, but enter into that reach with a large
wind no nearer to the south side then at 7 fathom water, for westward by
Vogelsand there reaches a point of sand outward, which you may sail by at
five or six fathom water, but with an east wind, when you must laveere, or
wind and turn, and that you go cross to and fro, then you may go within
five fathom deep of the wall. When the cape and Oosterender milles are one
against the other, keep them so as long as you can see them, and then the
corn mill and the water mill upon Wieringhen will be one against the other:
when you keep the aforesaid milles upon Tessel a bow length southward from
the cape, then run along by the south side, but go no nearer unto it, (when
you are within the beakon upon Vogelsand) then at 8 fathom, for there it is
very steep, and when the Oosterender milles are a hand staff length
northward from the cape, then you are on the north side, which is altogether
shoring and steep, and as soon as it begins to dry, you must turn as you
laveere, otherwise you would presently be upon the Land.

Without the Land of the Tessel, What Moon makes a full Sea before the Tessel.
an east and west Moon make a high water, and upon the Land or the shore an
east-south-east, and a west-north-west Moon, but in Copevaerders Rode a
south-east and by east, or a northwest and by west Moon. The stream runs
before the mouths of the channels about with the Son, so that when a ship is
at Anckor without the chanel, and is out of danger of the waves it shall have
but a little still water.

The foreflood and the after ebb fall both together into the Sea to the
Keysers Flat north or somewhat more westerly. The falling of the streams
To the contrary again the after flood and the fore ebb, fall inward to the
Land south, and somewhat more easterly, and to conclude the streams for the
most part run cross the channels, the flood for half the tide falls
northeast over the points, and then it runs into the Spaniards gat, but
without the Land the flood runs northeast and the ebb southwest, therefore
look well to your streams for it imports you much.

II. The description of the West coast of Holland between Huysden and the
Mase, showing what marks are thereon, and how you shall know them.
HUysduynen or the Tessel and the Mase, lie one from the other
south-south-west, and some what southerlyer, and north-north-east, and somewhat
northerlyer about 24 leagues distant. From Huysduynen to Petten it is 4 leagues
south and by west: Petten Petten.
has a small church with a little steeple, and about Petten you may see two
other sharp little steeples in the North land, full south there aboutes lies
the Houtbosch. A league south from Petten lies Camper Down, Camper-downe.
which is the best land there aboutes to be known: the north end is a slope
steep white banck, which runs stope downwards, but the south part thereof
is graye, and rough, overgrowne with heath, on the south side thereof there are
many rugged knottes or downs, and sometimes there runs a white blenck under
it, whereby it is very easily to be known. From Petten to Egmont upon the
Sea, Egmont upon the Sea.
it is 3 leagues. Egmont upon the Sea, also is very well to be known, for it
has a thick flat steeple which stands like a sail in the downs, and a
little to the south from it there you may see Egmont within, Egmont within.
which has two high towers upon the Abbay, which stand one right against the
other, whereof the one is sharp, the other, to wete that which is most north is
flat: for that one of the speeres thereof fell down not long since. On the
north side of the Abbay there is yet a tower of the church, which yet stands
upon the old wall, but it is not so high as that upon the Abbay: So that upon
the whole coast of Holland, there is no place so well to be known as this.
From Egmont upon the Sea to Wyck upon the Sea VVyck upon the Sea.
it is three leagues, which also has a flat steeple, when you are over
against Wyck upon the Sea, then north from thence you may see the steeple of
Beverwyck, which is a great high speere steeple, and besides this between
Egmont and Wyke upon the Sea you may see Castricom and other speere steeples.
From Wyke upon the Sea to Sandvoort it is 3 leagues, Sandvoort Sandvoort
has a speere steeple with a high beakon, which stands right south from it
in the black downs, which shows like a steeple. North from Sandvoort there
lies a high white down, where you may see Haerlem Haerlem.
over it, which is a high four square cross church, with a high spear steeple,
which stands in the middle of the church, and on the north side also an other
long small spear steeple, called Backenesser steeple. Here aboutes the Coast
of Holland has a great Creek or Inwyke. From Sandvoort to Nortwick Nordwyc.
upon the Sea it is 3 leagues, it is a flat steeple, and right against it there
stands a beakon: north from Northwick upon the Sea, you may see Northwick
within the land, which is a flat steeple, whereon there is a little cape not
very high and in the middle of the church there is a small tower. From Northwick
to Catwick Catwick.
upon the Sea, it is a league, which also has a flat steeple, which in times
past had a spear, right south from it there stands a high beako^, which you
may easily see before the steeple, there about also you see within the land
(when you are not far from the land) Catwick upon the Rhine, Rinsburgh, and
Valckenburgh, which are all spear steeples. From Catwick to Scheveling
Scheveling.
are 3 leagues, the quier of Scheveling church is higher then the body of the
church, as the Haeghes church is full south from that church there stands also
a beakon: about half a league within the land you may see the Haegh church, and
it is very well to be known. From Scheveling to the Heyde it is two leagues,
and from thence to Gravesand Gravesa^d.
or the north point of the Mase, it is a league, the Heyde is a village without
a steeple, but a little within the downs there stands a flat steeple called
Monster: But Gravesant is an high spear steeple, which is very well to be
known, and stands on the north point of the Mase. The Briel The Briel.
is a flat steeple, and that stands upon the south point of the Mase, and
this whole coast of Holland, from Huysduynen to the Mase, is altogether a fair
strand, you may go as near unto it as you will, at four or five fathom water
or thereaboutes.

Thus the coasts of Holland lies and shows, between Huysduynen and Wyck
upon the Sea, when you sail along by it about two leagues from the land.

III. How to know the land about the Mase, and how you must sail into the
Mase, as the expert and skillful Pilot of the Briel Jacob Bouwenson gave me
instruction at large in November 1607.
ON the north side of the Mase lies Gravesand, which has a high speere
steeple, which is called our Lady steeple, which is the best to be known of
all others in the Mase, and a little eastward from it there stands a flat
steeple called Monster, on the south side of the Mase, upon the land of Vooren
you shall see a great flat steeple which is within the Briel. Westward from
the Briel stands Eastvooren, which is a flattish steeple, with a small speere
upon it, like to the Haeghs steeple.

Thus appears the land of Vooren, as you are about a league without the Mase

Briel.

view of Voorne

To sail into the Mase.
If you will sail into the Mase, then sail til you bring both the capes which
stand upon the land of the Briel, one right against the other, and then they
will be about east and by south, and east-south-east from you, and sail so
upon them and you shall find the uttermost tonne, which lies at four fathom
and an half at low water, then the Haegh steeple is very near right against
Monster, which is a flat steeple which stands a little inward to the land
from the Hay. From the first tonne to the second, the course is
east-south-east, and so forward along to the fifth tonne, so that from the first
tonne to the fifth you sail along by the marks of the cape, but then you must
leave them. The second tonne lies at three fathom and an half water, the
third at the rising of the threshold, at three fathom, the fourth at the
dryest of the entry, at two fathom, but the fifth tonne again lies at three
fathom, and being at it, you are past the shallowest: all the tonnes in the
Mase lie on the north side of the haven, and are so near one unto the other,
that a man may easily see from the one to the other, you must sail between
the tonnes and the land, three or four ships length southward from the tonne
it is the deepest water. From the fifth to the sixth tonne, and so forward to the
ninth or last tonne, the course is east, the sixth tonne lies also upon the
north side, at two fathom and an half, but the right depth between the sixth
tonne and the land is about 5 fathom, and the nearer to the wall the deeper,
when you are past by the ninth or last to^ne (which lies right against the
Nesse) then turn toward the Mayland of the Briel, where you shall see
certain boys and some small tonnes, you must sail through between them, and
so along forward by the land, to the head, where you may cast anckor, when you
pass between the boys and the tonnes, there you shall find ten foot water
at the lowest, but there it is very narrow, so that you can not lavere or
wind there. Therefore if it chance that as you enter into the Mase you have a
sharp wind, then mark that when you come to the seventh tonne, Eastvooren
being three or four ships length westward from the uttermost cape, and about
southwest from you, that you keep those marks standing so, and go on
northeast, and so you shall go over a Flat of nine foot water, which is wide
and broad, when you are past it, you shall have three fathom water again, but
as soon as you perceive that it begins to be deep water again, then you
must presently sail southeast, toward the land of the Briel without danger,
and when you are at the head there you may cast ankor, there you have five,
six, and seven fathom water. If you will go farther up there you may have a
Pilot, and sail up the Mase where you desire to be.

To sail fra^ northward into the Mase.
If you come out of the north, and will enter into the Mase, then sail along by
the land of Holland at three fathom water, and go along in that sort within
the mouth or entry of the Mase so long until you have the capes upon the land
of the Briel one right against the other, and so you shall fall upon the third
tonne in the Mase, and from thence you may sail forward into the Mase, as I
said before.

By the footstrand of Gravesand there is now again a fair passage broken,
called the Landdeepe, or Northgat or channel, in the year 1608 marked at the
charge of the Seatownes lying upon the Mase, and now is signed with six red
tonnes.

To sail into the land deep or North-chanel.
If you will sail in at the Northgat or channel of the Mase, coming from Sea,
then set the beakons or capes that stand on the north side of the Mase full one
against another, hold them so standing and sail right forward, and then you
shall sail upon the body of the outmost tonne, which lies at 18 foot low
water: the tower or steeple of Gravesand lies severed from the uttermost tonne
full east and by north, and the Briel lies from it almost southeast and by
south, if then you set the tower or steeple of Gravesand east and by north from
you, and sail forward till the foresaid beakons come one against the other,
then can you not miss the uttermost tonne. From the first tonne to the second
and third is the course east-south-east. The second tonne lies upon twelve
foot, coming thither let the capes be a capstock-beame length each from other,
and the Hey stand under the down. The third tonne lies at eleven foot: then
Gravesand is on the high down. The fourth tonne lies at 11 foot also: then
comes Monster upon the bores house. When you are past the fourth tonne then
shall you find deeper water, namely 15 and 16 foot, and there if occasion
require, it is fit to anckor. But against the fifth tonne it is somewhat
shallower, for it lies at 12 foot, then comes Monster through Gravesand. The
sixth tonne lies also at twelve foot, and when you come unto it then comes
Eastvooren, upon the land of the Briel within the uttermost or the most
westerly cape. From hence which is on the southside of the Mase sail boldly
forward to the head of the Briel south-south-east, there are no shallowes nor
dangerous places, and there anckor where you please. All the tonnes upon the
north chanel are red tonnes and lie all on the south wall, so that if you sail
inward you must leave them all on starborde, and sail northward along.

They that come from Scheveling or out of the north along the strand, and will
go in at the north chanel of the Mase, must keep along the wall at eighteen
foot, and then they shall fall upon the uttermost tonne, or if you sail nearer
the shore at 11 or 12 foot, then you shall come to the second tonne. The wall
or shore is very fair without danger, so that (if there were no tonnes) you
might wholly pass by the footstrand, with the help and direction of the lead
at 10, 11, or 12 foot, so deep or shallowe as you thought good, or as the
flood permitted, when you are come in by the direction of the lead so far,
that Eastvooren comes through the uttermost cape on the south wall, then you
may sail right forward to the head of the Briel, as before is said.

This Situation of the North channel was described to me in writing by the
Pilots of the Briel in January, in the year 1610.

All the depths here specified touching the Mase, NOTA.
are to be understood at low water, and the measure of the depth is to be
understood of Mase feet, which are so much greater then the North Holland feet,
that they gain one foot in 12.

Before the Mase a southwest and by west, and a northeast and by east moon
make a high water, and before the Briel a southwest, and a northeast moon, and
it sloweth there with a continual daiely tide 5 or 6 foot up and down: a
little after that the flood begins to run without before the Mase, then it
falls also right into the Mase, so that there is small difference to be
seen, whether it be without or within the channel or mouth of the Mase.

IIII. How you shall sail into the Goree gat or channel.
IF you will sail in at Goree gat or channel, when you come out of the west,
then let the cape that stands upon the land of Goree stand right against the
steeple of Goree, and then it will stand east and by south from you, sail
straight upon it, A Flat before the Goree ga^
to the land of Goree, and so you shall go over a great Flat, where at low
water at the dryest, there is not less then three fathom water, or a little
more. When you are over that Flat, and go near to the strand of Goree, then
you have deeper water again, 5, 6, 7, and 8 fathom, then go forward close by
the footstra^d, until Goree stands s. w. from you, and the^ anckor where you
think good, for so far inward it is good anckoring in every place. But if you
come from the north or out of the Mase, then run along by the land of the
Briel at 4 fathom, but go no nearer unto it, for in some places it is
somewhat shoring, How to go into the Goree chanel, out of the north.
and when you are so far southward, that the steeple of Goree stands south
and by east from you, or somewhat more easterly, then sail right upon the Land
of Goree, and then also you shall sail over the Flat aforesaid, but when you
are near the Land of Goree, then beyond the Flat you enter into the deeper
water, then go in forward along by the Mayeland of Goree, (as I said before)
and ankor where you will. The Flat before spoken of is very broad, and
stretches cross over the channel, it is very even, and all of one depth. The
chanel of Goree is very broad and wide, for when the steeple of Goree stands
between east and by south, Marks of Goree gat or chanel.
and s. and by e. from you, then you may without al fear sail to the
footstrand of Goree, you must then still run over the Flat aforesaid, and
shall not find less then three, and three fathom and an half water at low
water, and when you come to the foot-strand of Goree, you shall have deeper
water, then go in forward by the mayeland as aforesaid.

To know Goree la^d.
The Land of Goree is known by the great flat steeple of Goree, and by a sharp
little steeple, which stands on the west end called Outdorp, further also you
see the cape there, whereof I spoke before.

Thus the Land of Goree shows when it is about a league crossewise from you.

Goree. Outdorp.

view of Goeree

V. To sail into the channel of Brewers haven.
HE that desires to sail into Brewers haven, he must understand that there
are three banks lying before the land, which run along by the strand, the
uttermost lies at least a kenning from the land, which is called the
Breebanck, Breebanck
upon it it is 7 fathom deep but within it it is again 19 fathom deep. The
second lies nearer to the land, upon the which it is five fathom deep, The
Ooster. Schelba^ck
and within it 7 fathom water. The third called the Schelbanck lies cross
before the mouth of the haven, without the first tonne, and upon it at low
water it is 3 fathom water.

If you will sail into the channel of Brewers haven, then set the two capes
that stand upon the Land of Schouwen one right against the other, and sail
upon them to the strand of Schouwen to four fathom water: and when you have
gotten to four fathom water, then run northeast in (yet as wind and stream
serves you) and there you shall find the uttermost tonne, which you must
leave to seaward, or on the baghborde, sail forward in that sort, so long
until that Renesse, stands eastward of the blenck, that is the high down
which lies on the west side of Bruwers haven, then Goree will be right against
Outdorp, or almost one upon the other, keep those marks in that sort, until
you have deeper water, or that you have past the second tonne, which as you
enter in leave upon starborde, when you will keep in the depest water, but you
may sail lower about. And then if you will sail to Brewers haven, then set
Bommene without the point of Ossesteert, and sail upon it to the foot strand
of Schouwen: for the sands on baghborde are very shoring, you must not go
nearer unto them when you lavere, then six fathom, go forward along by the
strand, to the head of the haven, and there anckor, there you shall have 8 and 9
fathom deep, the tonnes in Brewers havens channel are laid against the
Buysses go out to Sea, and taken in again when they have done fishing.

When a man comes out of the Sea, To know the land of Schouwe^.
the Land of Schouwen when you fall upon it, shows to your sight with 3 or 4
high and long white downs, which are called the Woolsackes, that in the west
is the highest and longest: upon the land also you may see some churches with
small speres, but on the south end toward Sealand, there is a high four
square flat church. Brewers haven has a sharp steeple, and the land of
Scouwen reaches it self out further east then the other lands, whereby also
it is well to be known. From the west end of the Land of Schouwen there is a
bad long Riffe, at least two leagues and more into the Sea, which is called the
Banjaert, The Banjaert.
from the uttermost end of the Riffe to Botkil, it is south-south-west, and
with such a course you can not miss it.

Thus the land of Schouwen shows when it lies about a league and an half
thartwise from you.

Brewers haven.

view of Schouwen

VI. How you shall sail into the Veer-chanel or Haven.
TO sail into the Veer-haven or gat (so called in Dutch) I counsel you not to
enter into it, before half flood be past, for the latter ebb, and the fore
flood fall right cross over the Banjaert into the Roompot, to the land of
Schouwen, but when the flood is half spent, then it runs right into the
Veer-haven, a south and a north Moon make the highest water in Veerhaven: and
an east and west Moon the lowest water therein: but when the Moon is
southeast or northwest, then the water there is 2 thirdpartes flood.

How to sail into Veer have^ coming out of the north.
If you will sail into the Veer-haven, coming out of the north, then go no
nearer to the land of Schouwen, or the Banjaert then seven fathom water: for
upon the Banjaert in some places it is not above 4 or 5 foot deep, and much
dryer: but beyond it, it is 7, 8, and 9 fathom soft ground, sail about it on
the outside, until that Eastchappell is half a ships length eastward from
Middleburgh, sail with those marks to Walcheren, Marks to ent^r the haven.
so long until that the steeples of Westkerck and Coortgeen be right upon each
other, or that the steeple of Coortgeen stands a bow length southward of the
flat steeple of Westkerck, sail then upon it, and you shall find the first
tonne, but go no nearer to the strand of Walcheren then 7 or 8 fathom water,
for if you do you may chance to sail behind a point of land called the
Onrust, which comes off from Walcheren. You must also go no nearer to the
land of Schouwen or the Banjaert, then 8 fathom water, for it is very steep.
The first tonne lies at 8 fathom, on the south strand, when you come to the
first tonne, you may easily see the second, and so forth from the one to the
other, all the four tonnes must be left on starborde when you go in, and you
must sail close by them, for on both sides it is very steep and shoring, when
you are at the innermost, then sail to the Mayland, and go close along by it
at three or four fathom, if you sail not upon the heads, you can not go
amiss upon the Dykes.

VII. To sail into the Botkill
Steenba^ck
TO sail into the Botkill, you must do it by day, and take heed of Stonebanck,
which is a banck lying a league and an half from the Land of Walcheren, along
in the Sea, stretching to the Botkill. The marks of this banck are these,
there stands a steeple between Eastchappel, Marks thereof.
and Westchappel, called Domburgh, now when the steeple of Middleburgh stands
just between Eastchappel and Domburgh, then you are at the eastende of this
banck, and when Middleburgh and Domburgh are one against the other, then you
are right over against the middle of that banck, but when Westchappel is
east-south-east from you or in a black valley in the downs, then you are
against the west end of that banck.

If you will go within or sail eastward about that banck to enter into
Botkill, To sail about on the east side of the Steenba^ck to Botkill.
then place Middleburgh steeple half way between Eastchappel and Domburgh, but
let Eastchappell be nearest, and so go toward the strand at 4 fathom and an
half, 5, and 5 fathom and an half, and cast out your lead along by the wall,
but when you come between Domburgh and Westchappell, there runs a sand off
from the Wall called the Cloots, which take heed of: therefore sail
south-south-west, or south-west and by south forward, so long until that
Westchappel stands southeast from you, or in a black valley in the downs,
keep it standing so, until that the two steeples of Eastchappel and Domburgh
be one against the other, and hold the Mayland side at 4 and an half, 5 and 6
fathom deep. And the two towers aforesaid, that is Eastchappell and S. Achten
or Domburgh are a little past each other, then presently you find deeper water,
that is 9 or 10 fathom, then sail southeast or southeast and by south, as the
wind s^rves, along the strand to Flushing.

But if you will sail without or about on the west side of the Stone banck to
the Botkill, To sail on the west side of the stone-ba^ck into the Botkill.
then run so long about east or west, (as you see your way) until that
Westchappel be east-southeast from you, and then Westchappel stands in a
black valley of the downs, sail so long ^owards it, until the steeples
aforesaid of Eastchappel and Domburgh are one somewhat past the other, then (as
aforesaid) you get deeper water, then run forward along by the land of
Flushing, the Seacoast there lies southeast, and southeast and by south. When
you are against Souteland, then ru^ne close by the foot-strand, A Flat
against Souteland.
for against Souteland there reaches out a Flat, and you must sail through
between that Flat and the strand, and there it is not very broad.

The land of Walcheren is a low plain land to see to, but upon it there
stands many steeples, which for the most part in times past were sharp
steeples, but at this time the most part of them are flat, Flushing has a
spier steeple, but Westchappel has a high flat steeple. From Flushing to
Westchappel it is three leagues, and between both there lies many rough
downs, the land between them reaches northwest and by north. Next to
Flushing stands Koukerck which is a sharp steeple, but next to Westchappel
stands Souteland, which is a flattish steeple. When you are in the Deurloy
then Westchappel stands bare without downs. From Westchappel to Domburgh it
is a league, that also is a sharp steeple, and stands next the strand, a
quarter of a league eastward stands Eastchappel, which is a flat steeple.
About a league eastward from the Hacken or Polder (which is the north end of
the land of Walcheren) there is a low downish land to behold. Southeast up
from this Hacken lies the Polder, which also is a flat steeple. By it also
there stands another flat steeple, called Sandwick. Veer also has a short
thick flat steeple, and upon that steeple there stands a small speere, so
that it is very easy to be known. But Middleburgh has a high speere steeple,
which is higher then all the rest.

Thus the land of Walcheren shows it self when you are in the Deurloy, or
before the Splete.

VVestchappel. Souteland. Middleburgh-Souburgh. Koukerck. Flushing.

view of Walcheren

VIII. How you must sail in and out of the Deurloy.
IF you will sail into the Deurloy, then you must run over the Raen The Raen
with your lead, until the sconce is a masts length from Westchappel, that is,
that Westchappel stands a mast length northward from the sconce, sail
toward it until the castle of Sluys be right east from the high downs of
Casand, there at a foreflood you shall find four fathom water, which is upon
the threshold of the chanel, where it will strait be over, and then you shall
find it a great half fathom deeper. Now when the castle of Sluys stands on
the east corner of the high downs of Casand, then go in southeast, and
southeast and by south, until that Middleburgh comes to the high downs,
which are between the Isehooke and Souteland, then change your course, and go
east toward Flushing, and you shall neither sail by Shallowes nor Sands.

If you desire to come out of the Deurloy, then from Flushing go west so long,
until the castle of Sluys be east from the high downs of Casand, keep those
marks standing so, and go northwest and by north forward, but as wind and
stream serves, and as you sail on this sort out, then mark the castle of
Sluys, and if it be east from the downs of Casand aforesaid, then you must
hold your course somewhat more westerly, and if the castle stands westward,
then you must hold your course more northerly, and hold it so standing east of
the downs as aforesaid, until that Westchappel be a mast length northward
from the sconce, then you are without all the Sands that may hinder you, and
may set your course whether you will.

IX. How to sail into the Splete.
THe Splete lies between the Deurloy and the Wielingen, he that desires to
sail into the Splete or the Wielinges, he must know, that from the banck of
the English Pol, there reaches a banck along the coast to Ostende, which is
called the Trip, The Trip.
which is about a quarter of a league broad, hard sand and very good anckor
ground, when you come out of the Sea you may perfectly sound the Trip with your
lead, all along the drougth, and it is very hard Sand. When Blanckenburgh
stands southeast and by east from you, then upon the Trip it is 6 fathom
deep with a low water, and the more westerly the deeper upon the Trip. When
you come southeastward a musket shot length or more over the drougth or hardness
of the Trip, then presently it is half a fathom deeper, and soft ground, which
is the channel of the Wielinges.

If you will sail into the Splete, coming west out of the Sea, leave the
coast of Flanders, and when you guess your self to be past Ostende, then cast
out your lead, until you find shallower water and harder ground, then you are
against the Trip, when you have found this shallowe, be it at 6, 7, or 8
fathom water, as you are easterly or westerly, (for the easterlyer the dryer,
and the westerlyer the deeper as aforesaid) then you must not pass over it so
toward the land, for you should fall into the mouth of the Wielinges, but you
must there put about a saker shot or more northward into the Sea, until you
have it somewhat deeper, and soft ground again, for northward from the Trip it
is also soft ground like the Wielinges, then run in east-north-east, and now
and then make southward toward the Trip, till you have shallowe and hard
ground, which is the north-side of the Trip, hold so all along by the Trip,
until that Brugge be over against Liswegen, or that Blanckenbergh be on your
side, then you are against the west point of the Raen in the Splete. If so be
you can see it, then hold Middleburgh standing over a high down, which lies
between Isehooke and Souteland, and from which on the east side there lies no
more downs, then go in east-north-east, and then you shall not sail by any
banck or Raen, until the castle of Sluys come within the high downs which lie
eastward from Casand, when you have these marks go freely forward to
Flushing, without any doubt, and you shall sail neither by Raesses nor French
Pol.

But if it chance to be dark or glome wether, then you must go along by the
north end of the Trip east-north-east, still sounding with your lead, until
you find the drougth or hard ground of the banck, and running so
east-north-east along by it, then you shall go in between the Raen and the
banck. The west point of the Raen is very flat, so that you may easily sound
it, and in the channel between the banck and the Raen it is soft ground, and
on either side, both on the Raen and on the banck upon the shallowe it is hard
ground. When in this sort you run in east-north-east, to the dryest part of
the banck, and that you put from the banck, then it begins to be deeper,
so that you may pass over the banck at 18 foot water half flood, but I
counsel you not to go over it, least you run upon the French Pol, but keep
along by the hard ground of the banck and direct your course somewhat
easterlyer to shun the Raesses, which reach into the Sea from the Souteland,
for you can not sound them with your lead, then when you are somewhat more
inward, go east to Flushing, and then you shall sail by no drougths.

IF you will sail out of the Splete, How you may sail out of the Splete.
then go from Flushing west and by north so long till S. Anne come without
the east down of Casand, then may you run forth into what chanel you vvil:
but if you will run out of the Splete then bring Westchappel out of the
dovvnes, and Middleburgh against the high down which lies betvveene the
Isehooke and Souteland, If you be next Flanders side, then S. Anne comes
first out of the downs: but if you be next Walcherens side, then Westchappel
comes forth first. When Middleburgh is against the foresaid down, then go
west-south-west, and keep Middleburgh so situate so long as you can see it.
When Brugghe comes against Lisweghen, then you are past all shallowes, and
you may set your course whither you will: or if it fall out that you loose the
sight of Middleburgh, then run along out by the course of Raen, which you may
wholly sound with the lead, but the Pol inward is altogether steep.

X. How to sail into the Wielinges.
When you come out of the Sea toward Flanders, and will sail into the
Wielinges, then seek out Liswegen, that is a thick flat steeple standing in
the downs: when Bruggeling stands a Cable length from Liswegen westward,
then are you from danger of all Sands, Pols, and Rasses: keep Bruggeling so
standing and so sail toward Flanders upon five fathom, there you find soft
ground. Then go east-north-east or east and by north, as the wind and stream
serves: keep the coast of Flanders at five fathom till Blanckenbergh comes
into the gappe of the Gallows field, that is a great gappe in the downs:
keep Blanckenbergh so standing till you see Heys in another great gap in the
downs, almost half a masts length east from the Ungeboedt, then is Westchappel
in Flanders full against Knock: then sail forward northeast and by east, and
northeast as the wind or stream is that you may run beyond the French Pol.
When S. Anne comes upon that high down of Casand which is most easterly then
are you beyond the French Pol and al shallowes, then sail forward to Isehook,
toward Walchere^, and forward by the dyke along by the Hoofden and so to
Flushing.

If you will sail into the Wielinges when you come out of the west, with a
south wind, then as it is aforesaid in the description of the Splete, you must
seek Flushing coast with your lead. When you are past Ostende, then you shall
find dry and hard ground, which is the ground of the Trip, which you must
sail over and when you are about the length of a musket shot over it, then you
shall presently have half a fathom deeper water and soft ground, then you are
in the chanel of the Wielinges, and in a good way, but if then you go
somewhat more to landwards or southeastward, then you will loose the soft
ground, and find hard and dry ground again, by reason of a Sand which lies
from Blanckenburgh about an English mile from the strand along the coast, so
far as to Wenduynen, where at a low water, you have 15 foot water at the
dryest, you may sail under this sand, when you go over the Trip a little
eastward from Ostende, and so go somewhat to far over to the strand: To
shu^ne the Banck of Blanckenbergh.
but to shun it you have no better means, but when you are past the hardness
and drynes of the Trip, and find soft ground with a little deeper water, that
then you put no more toward the land, but go in right northeast, and
sometimes northerly, according to the hardness of the Trip or banck, and then
hold off again, till you find soft ground again, whereby you shall be
assured, that you run along by the south end of the Trip, or banck in the
channel of the Wielinges, this do so long until Heys be about a masts length
westward from the beakon, then you must sound no more northward with your lead
for the banck there is very steep, for that close by the banck it is eight
fathom deep at the least. When Heyes is right against the beakon, then you
are right against the shallowest of the banck or English Pol, Marks of the
English Pol.
then go still east-north-east til Heyes be a mast length eastward from the
beakon, in a hole or plain where there are no downs, then you must go no
longer east-north-east, but go a point northerlyer, that is northeast and by
east, to shun the French Pol, Marks of the French Pol.
so long till S. Anne is right against the easterlyest high downs of Casant,
then you are past the French Pol, and all dangers. Then sail up the Isehooke
to Walcheren, and so along to Flushing as is said before.

Thus the coast of Flanders shows when you sail out and into the Wielinges.

XI. Of the falling and running of the stream in the channels of Sealand.
HE that will sail these channels, must necestarily understand, how the
streams upon the droughts (which lie before these channels) fall and turn
that he may know how to govern himself wisely and warily therein.

At Westchappel before the land a south and north moon makes a high water,
and when the water is fallen half an hour, then the stream begins to fall
outward, and when the water is risen half an hour, then it begins to fall
in, but when you are before the Botkill, then you must understand that the ebb
first begins to go, when the water has fallen an hour, but it falls
long into the Sea.

But in the Splete, and upon the drougths lying there abouts, the tides run
about against the Son, and at last falls into the chanel, an east and west
moon makes lowest water there, and the foreflood falls there over the
shallowes toward the land, but when the moon is about east-south-east, or
when the water has flowen about two hours, upon those shallowes, then the
tide begineth to turn southward, first south-south-west, and so by the south
to the east, so long till the moon be south-south-east, then the flood falls
east. But to know how far westward the tide begins to turn and by what
marks: you must understand, when Blanckenbergh stands about southeast and by
east from you, from thence the tide begins to run eastward, but from
thence westward you shall find no turning tides.

XII. To know all the places upon the coast of Flanders.
FLanders is a low hilly and downish land, full of steeples and churches, and
reaches from Calis to the point or end of the Swyne, most altogether
east-north-east, and west-southwest. To know it when you sail along by it,
from Sluys to Calis, first you have a flatt steeple called S. Anne, and then
the speere steeple of Knock, which stands further into the downs, Heys is
also a speere steeple which stands westward from the Knock, but westward from
Heys lies Liswegen, which has a flat steeple standing in the downs, then
follows Blankenbergh, which is a flat steeple, but not so big as
Liswegen, inward to the land from Blanckenbergh stands Bridges, and there
stands two speere steeples upon one church, and westward from Blanckenbergh
half a league lies Wenduynen with a speere steeple. Between Wenduynen and
Blanckenbergh, there stands an other steeple, called Ian Davies steeple, but
Ostende lies a league westward from Wackerbout, half a league westward from
Ostende lies S. Catheline. A league westward from it lies Middlekerck, which
is a thick flattish high steeple, from Middlekercke to Newport it is two
leagues, which has a flat steeple, and there within the land you may see
another speere steeple, a little eastward from Newport lies our Lady of
Lombardie, which is a high flat steeple.

From Newport to Broers it is almost 3 leagues, and from Broers to Duynkerck 4
leagues, Soutcotten is a league eastward of Duynkerck, Duynkerck has a high
flat steeple with a small speere steeple. From Duynkerck to Greveling it is 3
leagues, between them are these steeples, first little Sinten a speere steeple,
Great Sinten a flat steeple, Mardicke a great thick flat steeple, and S.
Georges a high speere steeple. Greveling has no steeples, but there are two
milles in it, one upon the Eastgate the other upon the westende of the town.
From Graveling to Calis it is also 3 leagues, Calis has many speere steeples
or towers, whereof one is higher then all the rest, and between them both are
these villages, but yet without steeples, unless it be one or two flat
steeples: first Hoogenprise and Dasen which are two flat steeples, and Valdam
a flat church with a small speere upon it, in the middle thereof. This is the
whole description of Flanders coast, from Blanckenbergh to Calis. So that the
coast of Flanders between Calis and Blanckenbergh is 24 leagues long, or as
some say 22 leagues, and Blanckenbergh from Flushing almost 9 leagues, so that
from Flushing to Calis it is at least 29 leagues, or as some say 31 leagues at
the most.

That which is here set down of the steeples and leagues along the coast of
Flanders, is by good and expert Pilots diligently collected and set down, and
is very necessary and convenient to be known, not only in regard of that
which is before said touching the Wielings, but also for the sailing by the
havens of Flanders, and specially for the knowledge of the Flemish coast, as
hereafter it is declared.

Thus the country of Flanders shows it self between Neweport and Ostende.

XIII. How to sail in to the Havens of Flanders.
TO sail into Ostende let the new church stand westward from the old church,
and so go in close by the west head, it is a tide haven which you must use
with high water, you must keep the fire-beakons one right against the other,
or a little a sunder, that they may stand southeast and by south from you, and
so go in right upon them, with a ship that draws not much water, you may
sail in there at half flood, and by night you may sail in by the lights of
the fire.

Neweport is a tyde-haven, which at low water is dry, at the continual
tides, there is two fathom water, at high water, To sail into Newport.
and at a spring tide it is 3 fathom water, but the latter flood brings most
water upon this coast, he that will sail into it, must stay till half flood
and set the highest beakon a little eastward from the lesser beakon, and so he
must sail into the Duycker. When the Duycker is under you have water enough,
but coming thither by night you shall understand, that they set out fire no
longer then from half flood to half ebb, which every man must observe.
Newport as I said before, is a dry haven, and westward it is flat water, and
from the east-head there comes a Sand falling down, where at a high water
you must go over, close by the banck it is 3 fathom deep.

To sail into Duynkerck.
At Duynkerck they burn fire by night, from half flood to half ebb, and no
longer: if you will enter into it, you must understand, that the lowest beakons
stand nearest to the water, which you must keep one right against the other
till you be within the heads, shun the west side, and run in close by the
east-head into the haven, the west-head lies further into the Sea then the
other does.

To sail into Greveling.
Greveling is a tyde-haven, where you must enter at high water, there stand
beakons which you must hold one against the other, and so sail in betvveene
the heads, on the vvest-side there is a Sand-banck which you must shun.

But when you go along by the coast of Flanders through Wolbrechsont, and
that you come at last to the Smal-banck, then you come to the west end of the
Sand that lies out at Greveling, which reaches far into the Sea, on the
east side thereof you may go into the haven of Greveling, and there a great
way it is flat water, but by night you must run in right upon the fire, and
right west from the haven of Greveling, there lies a banck of five fathom
about west into the Sea. There you may run over it at three fathom. This
Sand is called the Neweland, which lies along by the land to the haven of
Calis.

When you are past that Sand of Newland, then sail to the east head of Calis,
To sail into Calis.
and go in close by the head to the town, and when you are within the
west-head, then you must turn westward into the Cuype, where you lie dry at
low water, but from the west-head there comes a Sand-banck falling off, but
you must run in between that Sand-bancke and the east-head, when it is tide
there are two fires by which you go in.

There lies also cross from the west-head of Calis, a banck of two fathom,
between the head or Mayeland and this banck you may go through at 3 fathom
half flood, the banck is two fathom deep, and under Calis cliffe you may
anckor at 10 fathom at the east-ende, but at the west-ende there lies a rock
under the water, which is about a Culvers shot from the land, and this Calis
Cliffe lies between Calis and Swartenesse, whereof somewhat shall be spoken
in the chapter enseweing.

XIIII. The situation and stretching of the Flemish banckes.
ABout two leagues from Ostende lies the Tricx, The Tricx.
a banck whereon there is not above 15 or 16 foot water. When the Old church is
right against the steeple of the New church, then you are against this banck,
and when S. Catelines steeple is right against Ostende, then you sail against
that banck, between this banck and the head of Ostende there lies another
banck of 3 fathom water.

Between Ostende and Newport there lies 4 bancks, which begin al four right
against Ostende: the 2 nearest the land end against Newport, the other two
reach almost to Duynkerck, along the land. The first is called the Geere, Geere.
between this banck and the land there goes a chanel of 8, 9, and 10 fathom.

The 2 called Laland Laland.
which ends also against Newport, between these two bancks there runs
also a chanel, of 8 and 9 fathom.

The 3 is called Stroom, Stroom.
which runs almost to Duynkerck, on the east end having a point which
reaches east, ending almost against Newport, it is a banck of 3 or 4 fathom,
and of 5 and 6 fathom at the east end.

The 4 called Sandele, Sandele,
Calbanck, Calbanck,
or Oudemoers banck Oudemoers-banck.
runs along by Breebanck, the utmost end is at least 2 leagues long.

Such ships as desire to go into Duynkerck, and will not sail along by
Flanders, run about without these banckes, til they come against Breebanck,
and then go in by it at 5 or 6 fathom.

The chanel is 15 fathom deep, Marks of these bancks.
and every one of these four banckes has a dry polder, and when two flat
steeples southward from Newport stand a bow length from each other, then you
are right against these four Sands, which are no deeper with a low water then
1 fathom, and at a spring flood fall almost dry.

Between all these banckes you may anckor at 9, 10, 11, and 13 fathom, and
without it is 9, 10, 11, and 12 fathom deep, you may run over them at 4
fathom, but when you are vvestward from them, then it is deeper, that is 8 9
and 10 fathom.

Broers banck Broers-banck.
is three cornerd, it lies close by the la^d against Broers, and the Closter
in the downs, and reaches from the land about vv. n. vv. a league into the
Sea, when the Closter in the dovvnes or Broers lies s. from you, then you are
on the inside of Broers banck, you may pass along betvveene this banck and the
land at 4 fathom low water, but commonly men go west about it, when they
sail along by Flanders within the bancks.

Right westward from Broersbanck lies Cams banck, Cams-banck.
which is 3 fathom deep, which lies upon many Sands, you may also run
between this banck and the land at 8, 9, and 10 fathom, you may also ride
there safely against all winds upon the land of Flanders, between this sand
and Broers banck it is 5 fathom deep, when you go between this banck and the
land, you go alo^g by Quadeba^ck, to the entry of the chanel before Duynkerk.

Quadebanck Quaba^ck.
is a ba^ck which eastward from the head of Duynkerck falls of about 2
leagues west, ending against the heads of Duynkerck. East from the east-head of
Duynkerck have^ you may lie at rode safe against a n.w. north, and n. e. wind
behind this banck, and there it is 2 fathom deep low water, but at the
entry it is drier. Before the mouth of the haven at Duynkerck, it is 9 or 10
fadome deep, and on the west side of the west-head of Duynkerck it is 6, 7 or
8 fathom. From thence you may go over the Smal-banck Small ba^ck
at 3 fathom, and go toward the Broad-banck, this Smal-banck lies right
cross before the haven of Duynkerck, between Duynkerck and the Broad-banck.

From the west-head of Duynkerck there runs a banck toward Greveling two
leagues, which is called the Splinter, Splinter.
there on the west side you may sail under the Rode at 10, 8, 6, and 5
fathom, you must sail in close by the foot strand, you may sail in between
the land and this banck almost to the west-head of Duynkerck, but you must
sail out of it again backward.

When you ar a good way past the head of Duynkerck, about s.w. from the
Splinter, then you ru^ne over a sand of 2 fathom, which is called
Wilbaertsondt, Vvilbaertsondt.
being over it, it is 10, 11, and 12 fathom deep again. When Borburger
steeple is in the valley of the downs, then you are against this banck, and
with these marks you may sail through the banckes n.n.w. into the Sea, and so
come to the point of the Broad-banck, at 4 fathom, and then when you turn
somewhat toward the land again at 12, 13 or 15 fathom, then you may also
sail through the Broad and the Small banck e. n. e. or e. and by n. till you
have past the Closter in the downs or Broers banck, which comes down from
the Closter a league into the Sea, eastward past this banck it begins to be
flat water, against Newport 4 or 5 fathom, and when you are past Newport,
chose then the Mayla^d at 8 or 9 fathom keeping close by the land, then you
shall ru^ne between the land and a banck called Geere, which reaches toward
Ostende, but when you are against Ostende, you are free of the bancks, and then
you may safely put to Sea to go to the Wielinges.

There lie yet five long bancks along by the coast of Flanders when Greveling
is s. e. from you then you are against the south end of those banckes, and
when Newport is s. e. from you, then you are against the north end of those
banckes, Marks of the Flemish banckes.
they are very long, and between each of them there goes a white chanel of
8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 20 fathom deep each of a several depth.

The uttermost banck, which is most westerly and reaches not far northward,
lies from Calis Cliffe n. n. e. about 4 leagues and an half, and is 3 fathom
and an half deep, between this and the other banck there goes a white
chanel, of 23 and 24 fathom.

The second banck lies from Calis Cliffe The Cliffe.
northeast and by north, about 4 leagues, and there it is 5 or 6 fathom deep,
but at the south end there is a polder or sand of a fathom and an half. When
the south end of Winocxbergen is between the two flat steeples or towers that
stand westward of Duynkerck, then you are against this Polder which is called
the Cliffe.

There stand also three or four milles eastward from Duynkerck, when the
uttermost is against the east end of the town or wall, that also is a good
mark of this polder or sand, and Duynkerck tower will then stand about
southeast from you four leagues. Between this and the third sand there is also
a channel of 12 and 13 fathom.

The third banck lies northeast from Calis Cliffe, and is 4 and 5 fathom
deep, and at the south and north ends of this banck are polders or sands,
that most south is a fathom deep, and lies also upon the marks of
Winocxbergen, about northwest and somewhat westerlyer from Duynkerck, which is
called the Polder of the dyke, or Dyke-polder. The other polder or shallowe of
this banck is about four fathom and a quarter, and is called the Ruyting. The
Ruyting.
When the Closter in the downs is south east from you, then you are against
the Ruyting. Upon this banck you must be wary, for the Ruyting lies almost in
the chanel, and with a low water they have but two fathom deep, and are
very dangerous.

The fourth banck called Retlebanck, Retlebanck.
lies north-east and by east from Calis Cliffe, and is 3, 4, 5, and 6 fathom
deep, at the southende whereof also is a shallowe, of a fathom deep at low
water, and with a spring-streame these polders are dry. Between this also
there goes through a chanel of 19 and 20 fathom, and so also the aforesaid
banck.

Between all the banckes aforesaid there run fair channels, which you may
laveere from one banck to the other, and between all the said banckes you may
anckor where you w^ll.

The south end of Breebanck Breeba^ck.
lies east-north-east from Calis Clif, and has a sand or shallowe at the
south end, of two leagues long, and all through is three and four fathom
deep.

Westward from this banck there goes a great channel, of 19 and 20 fathom,
which reaches farthest northward, so that the north end thereof is northwest
and southeast from Newport: but it lies far without the land, so that the
north end of these three banckes may well be the same, which is called the
Broers banck, for they lie right with the north end against Broers banck, and
the Closter in the downs lies then south-south-east from you, about 4 or 5
leagues, and at the north end they are 6, 7, and 8 fathom deep.

XV. Of the running of the stream in all these places aforesaid.
IN the North Sea, the stream falls in round more then half a tide, in the
Breadth 14 it follows the Son or the moon, and falls but one quarter
right along the Sea, coming along by the coasts against Holland and Sealand,
the stream whether it be ebb or flood runs right to the land, but in the
middle of the tide, then the stream runs right along the Sea, but at the
last of the tide it will run inward to the Sea, whether it be westward or
northward.

How the streams fall into the Marsdeepe is also declared before, that the
foreflood and the latter ebb fall northward cross the channels, to the last
quarter of the tide, and the latter flood with the fore ebb contrarily
southwards over the grounds.

The flood runs not into the Mase before it be a quarter flood, and although
the foreflood falls toward the land into the channel, yet the latter ebb
comes out of the channel over the Sands, and so fall again one with the
other into the Sea.

But if you will sail into the Veerhaven or chanel, you must understand that
the flood falls not right in, before the moon be right southeast, and
southeast and by south, and then it is about half flood, for along by Sealand
side the flood falls outward along the Bangaert northward, against Sealand in
the channel a third part of the flood falls toward the land, then it
begins to fall northeast and by north.

Between Marsdeepe and the Mase in the channel the foreflood comes out of
the north Sea, and so follows after the moon falling toward the land n. e.
and n. e. and by n.

Along by the Flemish banckes, the foreflood falls to the land over the
banks, and in the middle of the flood it falls right into the Sea, but the
latter flood falls northward into the right channel.

XVI. What moon makes high water in these places.
BEfore the points or hooks of the Tessel an east and west moon makes a
high water.

Between Haerlem and Petten a w. n. w. and e. n. e. moon makes a full Sea.

Before the Mase a s. w. and by w. and a s. e. and by e. moon make a full Sea.

Along by Sealand in the channel without the Flemish banks a south west moon
makes a full Sea.

Before the Wielinges, a southwest, and s. s. w. moon makes a full Sea.

Along by the coast of Flanders upon the land a north and south moon make a
full Sea.

Before Fulshing and the Veere, it is full Sea with a south and by west and a
north and by east moon.

Before Ramekens and Armue a s. s. w. moon makes a full Sea.

Before the Briel a southwest and northeast moon.

Before Delfs haven a w. s. w. moon makes full Sea.

Before Rotterdam a s.w. by s. moon makes high water.

Before Marsdeepe an east and west moon makes full Sea.

Before Tessel at Copevaerders Rode an e. s. e. and w. n. w. moon makes high
water.

Upon Wieringer Flat it is high water with a s. e. moon.

XVII. Of the depths against these places, and at what depths a man may see the
land.
Between the Marsdeepe and the Heads in the right chanel it is 23 or 24
fathom deep, but coming by Goodwin or about the Foreland it is 26, 28, and
30 fathom deep, the nearer Goodwin the deeper water.

Right without the Flemish banckes it is 18, 19 and 20 fathom deep.

Between the Breadth-fourteen and the land it is deep 19 fathom, and as
soon as it is 16 or 17, fathom then you begin to see the land, upon the
Breadth-fourteene it is 14 fathom deep.

The high steeples of Holland and West Vreesland are seen sooner then the
downs, as Egmont upon the Sea, the steeples of Egmont within, Wyck upon the
Sea, Sandvoord, and other steeples, and then you are about 5 leagues from the
land, and then it is 14 or 15 fathom deep.

But Camper downs and the downs against Hhaerlem, are seen before some
steeples, now most of the steeples are flat, except Scheveling and Sandvoort.

Before the Mase and Goree, you may see land at 14 or 15 fathom.

You may see Sealand from the poope of the ship at 16 fathom.

You may see Flanders at 15 or 16 fathom, and then you are within the tail of
the Flemish banckes.

The Clif of Calis and the point of Dover may be seen when you are before the
Heads at 24 fathom.

XVIII. How these places lie one from another.
FRom Tessel to Petten south and by west 4 leagues. From Petten to Egmont s. s.
west 4 leagues. From Egmont to the Mase south south w. 15 leagues. From the
land of Vooren to Goree southwest 2 leagues. From Goree to the land of Schouwen
south w. 2 leagues. From the land of Schouwen to Walcheren south w. 4 leagues.
From Flushing to Blanckenhergh w. s. w. 10 leagues. From Blanckenbergh to

leagues. From Newport to Duynkerck west south west 5 leagues. From Duynkerck to
Greveling west south west 4 leagues. From Greveling to Calis w. s. w. 4
leagues. From Calis to Calis Cliffe southwest and by west 1 league.
XIX. How these places lie distant from other countries.
FRom Tessel to Bornriffe the course southwest and northeast about 12 leagues.
From Tessel to the Mase the course s. s. w. 24 leagues. From the Mase to
Kaybanck the course s. w. and n. e. 18 leagues. From Tessel to Pas of Calis
southwest and somewhat more southerlyer, and n. e. and somewhat more
northerlyer 52 leagues. Calis lies s. w. and by south from Tessel, then you
come upon the Flemish bancks, and the Foreland lies s. w. from Tessel, then
you come upon Goodwin or Querens. Therefore every man must be very wary and
take heed thereof. The Flemish Banckes may be sounded with the lead, at 15 and
16 fathom, and the chanel is 24 and 25 fathom deep. But Goodwin is steep
and uneven, for at one casting of the lead you have 26 fathom, and at another
cast of the lead you shall be fast upon the Sand, the south end of Goodwin you
may sound at 15 and 16 fathom. From Tessel or Marsdeepe to Calis Cliffe s. w.
by s. 52 leagues. From Tessel to the Foreland southwest 47 leagues. From Tessel
to Orfordnesse west-south-west 36 leagues. From Tessel to Yarmouth west, and w.
and by s. 32 leagues. From Tessel to Schilt or Crammer west 40 leagues. From

From the Wielings to Dover w. s. w. 24 leagues. Out of Pas de Calis to the
Riffe n. n. east 120 leagues. From Calis Cliffe to the Neuse in Norwaie n. and
by e. 153 leag.
XX. Under what degrees these places be.
HUysduynen lies just under 53 degrees, sail east out of the North Sea and
you shall see it.

The north cape or point of the Mase lies under 52 degrees you shall sail by it
when you sail east under this height.

Flushing, Ramekens and Westchappel lie under 51 degrees, and under this height
are east from you.

The Pas of Calis and Dover lie under 51 degrees 12 minutes.

Here follows the Card N. 3.

CHAPTER III. A DECLARATION HOW a man shall sail all the Seacoasts and
Havens of Picardie and Normandy, between Calis and Cape de la Hague: And What
Banckes, Sands, Cliffes or Rocks, and Shallowes are there to be found, and
how you may shun them.
I. To sail from Calis to Diepen.
IN the middle of the Heads between Calis and Dover lies the banck of
Vrouwesand, Vrouwesandt.
of 5, 6, 7, and 8 fathom deep, the shallowest or dryest part of Vrouwesand
lies about west and by south from Calis Cliffe, and south, and south and by
west from Dover, where it is dryest, and no deeper then 4 fathom.

This banck aforesaid reaches along the land of Swartenesse, and lies nearest
to the French side, it is at least 4 leagues long, on both sides of this banck,
both on the east and west sides it is 20 and 21 fathom deep.

Cross from the west-head of Calis there lies a banck of 2 fathom, you may
sail between the head or Mayeland and this banck at 3 fathom, with half
flood, you may anckor under Calis Cliffe Rode to anckor under Calis Cliffe.
at the east end at 10 fathom water, but at the westende of Calis Cliffe
there lies a Rock under the water the length of a Culver shot from the land.
The high land between Calis and Swartenesse is called Calis Cliffe.

A league and an half southward from Calis lies Swartenesse, Swartenes.
which is a foul point lying out, by the which there lies certain Rocks,
you cannot anckor there, for the ground in that place is very foul. A little
way southward of Swartenesse there stand some few houses with a mill, all
along to the mill you may not anckor, but you will endure some hurt and damage
either in your cables or anckors.

Two leagues southward from Swartenesse lies the Oldman or Tour d'ordre, Tour
d'ordre, or the Oldman.
there is a fair sandy Baye, there you may lie safe and free from a north
wind, it is a good Rode for northeast, east, and southeast winds, for ships
that will fail eastward, you may anckor there at 6 or 7 fathom, so that the
point or the steeple be north and by east from you.

But half way between Swartenesse and the Old man lies S. John's Rode, S.
John's Rode.
there you may anckor at 15 or 16 fathom, for there it is fair ground. To
anckor there you must bring the steeple of the village against the middle of
the houses, but there lies some rocks along by the land, which you must be
careful to shun, and go not near unto them.

About two leagues from Tour d'ordre lies Beunen or Bullen, and when such as
lie at anckor under the Oldman go on land they may from above look down into
the River of Bullen.

Between Tour d'ordre and the Sum Sum.
there is a great creek, and when you are right against the Sum it is
shallowe water, 3 or 4 leagues at the least into the Sea, about 6 or 7 fathom
deep, such ships as come out of the west, are many times cast away there,
but when you find shallow water for a long time, you must understand that you
are about the river of Sum.

He that will sail up to Bullen To sail into Bullen haven.
must go by the land by Tour d'ordre, at 3 fathom, and then along by the land
to the middle of the river, and then keep the middle of the chanel: the north
side is full of rocks or cliffes, and from the south side there comes a
riffe or sand shooting out and runs a good way by the haven, which you must
be wary of, and close before the river also there lies a banck which you may
sail under on the south side at two fathom, and on the north side at 3
fathom, and there you may anckor or go into the haven. It is a tyde-haven
where you must go in at a high water, and at a low water sit dry, as you do
in all the havens of Flanders. You may there run close along by the coast, at
2, 3, 4 and 5 fathom, as dry as you will, but before the havens you must put
somewhat further off because of the rocks which lie before them.

The course from the Oldman to the river of Sum is south and north, distant 8
or 9 leagues, and from Bullen to Sum Sum.
it is south, and south and by west, distant 6 leagues. Between them there are
two rivers more, the one called Cauche, Cauche.
the other Antij: Antij.
upon the first there lies Monstruel and Estaples, Estaples and Monstruel.
about 3 or 4 leagues southward from Bullen. This is no special haven, you
must enter into it at high water, and keep the middle of the channel, you
shall find it dry when you are within it.

To sail up the river Sum
Before the Sum it is shallowe water at least two leagues into the Sea, at 5
or 6 fathom, and from the north point of the river there comes a Riffe or
Sand shooting out, which runs almost over the deep, so that a man passing
it by the south shore, he must sail at 3 fathom water, as far as to S.
Valeries, which lies on the south side, and then from the southshore there
comes another Sand shooting off, almost clean over the river, so that as
then you must turn to Crottoy, which lies on the north side, if it were not
for the banck aforesaid, (which runs cross over before the haven) it were a
haven for a great ship to go into, for in the entry of the haven it is 3
fathom, and within 2 fathom deep, Abbeville Abbeville.
lies about 5 leagues upwards in the land.

From Tour d'ordre or the Oldman to Deep, the course is s. s. w. 16 leagues,
but from the river of Sum to Diepen Diepen.
it is southwest and northeast, 8 or 9 leagues, between both, that is 4
leagues from Sum, and 4 leagues from Deep, lies the river of Heu, and on
the north side thereof a little town called Triport or Tresport, where into you
must enter with a high water, as in a tyde-haven, with low water lying dry.

To sail into the haven of Diepen.
The Haven of Deep, on the east side is to be entered at 3 fathom, there lie
three tonnes in the chanel, you must sail from the one unto the other, leaving
them on your left hand as you go in, on the east side of the land there
shoots a piece of land out along, but if you keep at 3 fathom, then you
sail not under that piece of land, and from the west point of the haven or
town, there comes a great Sand running down, and reaches north: without in
the chanel it is 3 fathom, and within somewhat dryer, that is 2 fathom. There
may a reasonable great ship go into the rivers of Sum and Deep when it
flows, but small ships may go in there at half flood, at a low water you
lie dry.

To sail from Deep to the river of Roane, you have first from Deep to S.
Valerie or Valderie in Caux S. Valerie in Caux.
4 leagues. This is a dry tyde-haven, wherein you must enter with high water,
whereby there goes none but small ships in and out from it.

From S. Valerie to Fecam To sail into Fecam.
it is w. s. w. 4 leagues, it is a fair tyde-haven, where at low water there
is about 2 fathom.

There lies a banck or Flat on the east side of the haven, you may pass with
small ships between the land and this Flat with the lead, at 8 or 9 foot
water, having regard to the Eastland for that is flat.

But if you will go about or without the Flat, then you must place Fecam
steeple without the land, or without the west point of the haven, and then it
will stand s. s. e. from you, and so go into the haven, then the Sand is on
baghborde. Eastward of the said haven also there is a channel to go in, but
the west side is best, having in the haven 2 fathom water, and when you are
within before the town, there you may anckor on the west side at 3 fathom
half flood, the east side is flat.

From Fecam it is w.s.w. to Struysaert, Struysaert and Seynhoft.
a little town lying in a Creek about 3 leagues from Seynhead or Seynhoft.

Without the point of Struysaert lie two high sharp Rocks, and are about
north, and n. and by e. from Seynhead 2 leagues.

From Deep to Struysaert it is w.s.w. distant 8 leagues, and from Struysaert
to Seynhead south and north 2 leagues.

About n.w. from Seyne-head there lies a banck of 3 fathom at low water, or
as some say 2 fathom and an half. When the town of Hable is without
Seyn-head, then you are against the banck, and you go in close by Seynhead to
the first mil, and there anckor at 6 fathom, staying for a Pilot to bring you
into the haven.

The land from Calis Cliffe to beyond Bullen shows it self thus, when you
sail along by it.

Calis Cliffe. Tour d'ordre, Oldman. The land of Bulloigne.

view of Calais

II. To sail into the Rode of Newhaven and the River of Roane.
When you come from the north, and will sail up the River of Roane, To sail
into the river of Seyne.
you must sail right to Seynhoft, so long until the south point of the River
be against the point of Seynhoft, hold it so standing, and make straight
toward it, so long until the land which lies east from Newhaven be without
Newhaven, To sail to Newhaven.
then sail to the haven of Newhaven, or if you will go about without the
banck, then wind so much off from the land, and sail west about until the
River opens, then sail to the point of Tochet, and go into it with your
lead, at high water it is 3 fathom, and at low water a fathom deep.

To shu^ne the Rettiers.
The Rettiers lie in the middle of the River, which are stony, hard, sandy
ground.

When the land of Caen is without the point of Seyn-head, then you sail
without them if you hold south, on the north side it is 3 fathom deep at half
flood, on the south side at half flood it is but 2 fathom deep.

To sail into the Seyne to Newhave^.
If you come out of the west, you must run into the river of Roane with the
tide, and that when the most part of the flood is gonne, then sail along by
the land of Deep by your lead, till you may see the river of Newhaven open,
then the south castle is right against the east-head and the mill, run right
upon it, but sail but half way to the castle and Seynhead, stay there for a
Pilot, but if none come to you, then sail right upon the castle which stands
upon the head, there it is deep water.

When you hold Struysaert a bow length without the land of Seynhead, then you
go without the Rettiers and the banck, then the east gate of Newhaven is right
against the east-head and the east mill, then you go right northward in from
the Rettiers, and then you can not miscarie on the banck which lies toward
Seynehead, and when you are a little way from Seynehead you must stay for a
Pilot, as I said before.

The Rettiers.
The Rettiers reach along in the middle of the River toward the point of
Honfleur, and westward from them it is all full of Sands, so that you must
sail in with high water.

He that will enter into Newhaven he must go in with a high water, and every
tide lie dry.

He that will go from Newhaven upward to Roane, he takes a Pilot, you must
go with a tide through the first dry banckes, which reach from Newhaven to
Honfleur s. e. along by the south land, the banckes reach along by the north
side of the River to Kilgebuf, then you are past the first banckes, but let
every man be wary of the strong spring-tyde, (by the Normans called the
Bar) which comes with such a force, that you can hardly stay a ship with
all her anckors and cables, for this and other dangers it is not good to sail
up the River without a Pilot, and it is a water for a Pilot.

III. To sail from the River of Roane to Cape de Hague.
TWo leagues southward from the river of Roane, To sail into Tochet.
there lies a tyde-haven called Tochet, there stands a beacon on the west
point of the haven, by the which you go in, or you may go in (with good heed)
on the east side, some French ships go in and out that way.

From the point of Seynhead s.w. and s.w. and by s. about six leagues, there
lie many banckes a great way into the Sea, To sail into Fosse of Caen.
men sail east and west from them into the River or Fosse of Caen, which for
the most part reaches in south, and lies in a Creek.

On the west side there is a Boght, you may anckor behind it, there it is wide
and broad, and all sand strand.

The east land is downie and shallowe, to enter upon with the lead, without it
is far shallowe to wete 6 or 7 fathom.

From Seynhead to Cape de Barchfleur, Cape Barchfleur
or Cape de Chierenberch the course is east and west 19 leagues.

About 4 leagues eastward lie the Islands of S. Mark, Islands of S. Mark. La
Honge.
which you may sail round about, but it is not all to fair there.

Right west from the Islands of S. Mark or Markel about a league lies la
Honge, which has a flat steeple, there westward lies the point of Barchfleur,
with a fair Creek, Baye of Barchfleur
wherein you may lie safe against a n. n. w. wind, at 6 or 7 fathom, a north
east wind blows right into it by the north point, which then lies from you
n. n. w. there falls a banck off from the land but a ship may well go over
it.

This Baye and the Islands are by our Sailors called the Hongiers, but when you
come out of the west, you shall not find less then 4 or 5 fathom water, and
there you are safe almost from all winds.

From the point of la Honge to Chierenberch Chierenburch.
it is 4 leagues, west, and w.n.w. Chierenberch is a small tyde-haven.

Westward from the point of Barchfleur there are foul passages, when the high
land of Chierenburch comes without the Cape la Wyke, you can take no hurt on
the^. A great league northeast from the point of Barchfleur there lies a rock
under the water but no ship can go over it.

It is also good lying before Cape de Wyck, Rode before Cape la Wyck.
right east from the two high cliffes in a sandy Baye at 6 fathom.

And before Chierenburch lie the Cliffes or Islands, which round about are
fair, westward from them you go into the Fosse of Moberille, To sail into
Moberille.
a tyde-haven, on both sides having high cliffes or rocks four or five in
number, you may pass in between them to Moberille at high water.

A league westward from thence lies Cape de Hage Cape de Hague.
or Hague, from Cape de Hage west and by north almost 3 leagues, lies the
Island of Aldernex, or Ornay, Ornay.
reaching east and west, between this Island of Ornay and Cape de Hague runs
the Rasse of Blanckert, Ras of Bla^ckaert.
but westward from Ornay lie the Casquettes, or Kiscasses, which in the next
Chapter shall be described.

Thus Chierenburch and the land after the Cape de Hague shows it self, when
it is southeast from you four leagues.

VI. Of the falling of the streams, and what Moon makes a high water on
these coasts.
BEfore Calis and Swartenesse the flood falls one quarter toward the land,
then it falls north-north-east and south-south-west, and there on the land a
southeast moon makes an high water.

From Swartenesse to Bullen the flood falls n. and by e. upon the land, but
without in the Sea it falls n. n. e. and s. s. w. a south-south-east moon
makes a high water there.

From Bullen to Diepen, and before the river of Sum the flood falls a
quarter toward the land, then it falls northeast and by north, a
south-south-east moon makes the highest water in this haven.

From Diepen to Struysaert without the land in the Trave, the flood falls
northeast and by east, and the ebb s. w. and by w.

From Struysaert to Caen in the Fosse, the flood falls south-south-west, and
the ebb n. n. e.

From Seynhead to Barchfleur the flood falls east and by north, and west and
by south by the land, but in the chanel without the land the flood falls e.
n. e. and the ebb w. s. w.

At Newhaven and in the river of Roane, it is high water with a southeast moon.

Before the haven of Caen it is high water with a south-south-east moon, and
within the haven with a s. and by e. moon.

At Markel, la Honge, Berchvliet, Chierenburch and Cape de Hague by the land a
s. and by e. moon makes a high watr.

VII. At what depths you may see these places, and how you shall know the land.
When you are through the Heads, against the Singles or about Deep, and being
a little out of the chanel, you may see the land at 20 and 21 fathom.

The high land of Staples lies southward of the Oldman or Tour d'ordre, it is
very high land, the steeple of the Oldman is a thick flat steeple, and
stands upon the northpoint of the haven of Bullen, if you fall upon the river
of Sum, it is shallowe water, 8, 9, and 10 fathom, and then the high land of
Estaples will be north-north-east from you.

The land from the river of Sum to Deep is all sandy strand, and there you
find diverse speere steeples, and some milles and trees upon the land.

About 4 leagues without Struysaert it is 20 fathom deep.

Five leagues without the land of Caen it is 22 fathom deep.

Against the cape of Barchfleur and Chierenburch 4 leagues from the land it is
30 fathom deep.

The land between Deep and Stonehead is known because there stand many
churches with speere steeples and other trees and houses, but Struysaert is
best to be known, because there is a high cliffe thereon like to a high
steeple, and in the Trave it is 16 or 17 fathom deep.

La Honge is a flat steeple lying two leagues eastward from Barchfleur, there
lie the two Islands of S. Mark eastward, which you may sail round about.

Barchfleur is a high point, and there stands a flat steeple beneath upon
the white land, and about eastward is more white land, and there stand two
milles, and some houses upon it, whereby this point is well to be known.

Upon Cape de la Hague stands a castle with a small tower, and a little
eastward within the land there stands a speere steeple, and Chierenburgh
lies two leagues about eastward upon the water side, having a flat steeple.

VIII. Under what degrees these places lie.
CAlis Cliffe lies under 50 degrees 52 minutes.

The river of Sum lies under 50 degrees 18 minutes.

The point of Struysard lies under 49 degrees. 45 minutes.

CHAPTER IIII. THE DESCRIPTION OF all the Islands, Seacoasts, and Havens of
Normandy and Britanie, situate between Cape de Hague and the Seims, and how
you shall sail by them
I. The situation of the Islands of Ornay, Casquettes, Garnsey, Sarck, and
Iarsey.
ON the Cape de Hague, west and by north almost 3 leagues, lies the Island
Aldernex, which is also called Ornay, Ornay.
it is almost three leagues long, reaching east and west. The east end is
fair, for you may there sail indifferently close by the land, but at the west
end it is very foul. There lie some small Islands off from the west end,
when you are past them, then you may well sail to Iarsey, the Islands lie close
on the west end, and southward from these Islands there shoots out a rock or
stone-riffe, when you are there within on the south side it is fair. The south
point of Ornay is foul, he that will anckor there southward, he must be
careful to set right east from the tyde-haven.

The Casquettes or Kiscasse Casquette^, Kiscasses.
are distant from this Island of Ornay w. n. w. and west and by north almost 3
leagues. The uttermost of them is a great high Clif which has many rocks
round about it. In the middle between this Cliffe or Rock and the Island of
Ornay lies another rock, but that is not so high, but there are many other
rocks, which reach out from it toward the other rock, when it is low water
then you may see them all. These two rocks are by the French men called
Casquettes, and by the Dutch men Kiscasses. Some Shippers and Sailors are much
deceived herein, which know not these Rocks, calling the land of Chierburch the
great Kiscas, and the land of Ornay the small Kiscas, for the Kiscasses are
nothing else but mere rocks lying out in the Sea. About w. n. w. and w. and by
n. from this Island of Ornay or Aldernex, there lie two other smooth great
Rocks, called Barroches, Barroches.
which lie on the west end of Ornay close by the land.

To know Ornay, you must understand that the north side has a white hill or
down, and the west end is high and steep downwards, at the east end it is
hilly and dalie, but lower then upon the west end, you may see a steeple or
two upon it and some milles.

Thus Ornay shows when you sail along by it being four leagues from the land.
view of 'Ornay' (Channel Islands) Thus Ornay shows it self with Casquettes,
south-south-east being three or four leagues fom you.
view of 'Ornay' (Channel Islands)

From Ornay to Garnsey the course is w.s.w. about 8 leagues but from the
Casquettes to the west end of Garnesey Garnsey.
the course is west and by south 8 leagues. To know Garnesey, you must
understand that the east end is flat and the west point steeping downwards.

There stand two speere steeples upon it, and some milles, and the land is
dubble when you sail northward by it about four leagues from the land, then it
shows as it is here set down.

Thus Garnsey shows when it is cross from you 4 leagues.
view of Guernsey

But coming out of the west, and that Garnsey lies e. n. e. or e. and by n.
from you then it shows thus.

view of Guernsey

He that comes out of the north, and intends to anckor under Garnesey, Rode
under Garnesey.
he must go westward about the rocks of Kafquettes, and so sail upon the
northende of Garnesey, until the castle which stands upon the rock be right
against the south end of the land, which you must hold so, until you come by
the castle, but beware of the little Island called Arem, Arem.
for it is almost full of rocks about it, between the castle which stands
in the water and the land is a good Rode, but if you will anckor without the
castle, then do it at 12 and 13 fathom, or if you will anckor between the
point of the land and the castle, then sail till you be at 6 or 7 fathom low
water, and there anckor. You must understand that there aboutes it ebbeth and
flows 6 or 7 fathom up and down at every tide.

Or else help your self with these marks: when you are west from the
Kasquettes, then go southeast in, until that the east-ende of Garnesey lies
south and by west from you, then sail upon it, then you shall see the castle
upon the rock, and then do as you are taught before. Between the Kasquettes
and Garnesey it is 35 and 40 fathom almost al stone ground.

He that comes out of the west, or from the Kasquettes and will anckor upon
the southside of Garnesey, he must ru^ne close about by Cape de Gruse, or by
the southwest end, along by the south side of the land, and when he is full
half way from the land, he may anckor where he will at 18 or 19 fathom, and
if the wind should chance to blow southwest, or w.s.w. he may go about the
point, and anckor on the north or south side of the castle, as I said before.

From the south side of Garnesey there lies a rock above the water, which men
must be careful to shun.

There lies also a row of rocks south and by west, and s. s.w. from Garnesey
called Rockedoves, Rockedoves.
about 8 leagues from it, which are at least a league long.

From Rockedoves to Cap Farelle the course is s.e. 11 leagues.

From Rockedoves to the Island Briack s. and by w. 8 leagues.

From Rockedoves to the Rocks called the Monckes west and by north 10 or 11
leagues.

From Rockedoves to the rock Canine the course is south and by west 4 leagues.

From Garnesey to the seven Islands the course is southwest and by south 17
leagues.

From Garnesey to S. Maloes the course is south-south-west, and southeast and
by south 17 leagues.

From Garnesey to Sarcke the course is e. and by n. a league.

Between Garnesey and Sarcke there lie two little Islands. Arcke and Arem,
Arcke. Arem.
you may sail between them: he that will anckor under Sarcke, must do it at
26 or 27 fathom, you may anckor round about Sarcke, but from the north and
south ends there shoots out certain rocks, whereof some of those at the
north end lie under the water, but at the south end they lie above the water.

Sarcke, and the Rasse of Ornay, or Cape de Hague lie distant southwest and by
south, and northeast and by north 8 leagues.

From Cape de Hague to the northwest end of Iarsey the course is
south-south-west, then you run through between Iarsey and Sarcke. Sarcke.
Sarcke and Iarsey are distant 4. leagues.

From Garnesey to Iarsey Iarsey.
the course is southeast 8 leagues, round about under Iarsey is good Rode, on
the north side you may anckor all along at 10 and 11 fathom, at the west end
there are some rocks, specially on the west point, Rodes under Iarsey.
there the rocks lie a good way off from the land, but between both points
you may anckor at 10, 11, or 12 fathom. On the south side of Iarsey it is also
a good Rode for northwest, and west-north-west winds. On the east side of
Iarsey it is good lying at rode in Catelynen Baye, a little within, or eastward
from the west point, on the north side of Iarsey there lie some Rocks, which
are called the Paternosters. Paternosters.
When you come out of the west, you may run between them and the land at 11
fathom, and anckor before the sandy Baye, called Trinity, there is good
anckoring at 10 and 11 fathom, leaving the Paternosters, or Rocks of Pierlech
north-north-west from you.

From the west end of Iarsey to S. Maloes the course is south and by east, and
s. s. e. 8 or 9 leagues, but about midwaie between the west end of Iarsey,
and the I Will of Sicember, which lies before S. Maloes, there lie certain high
rocks in the chanel, which contain in circuit, to sail about them, Monks
or Minkes.
about 8 leagues, which a man must be careful to shun, which rocks are
called the Monckes.

From Iarsey to Concale the course is south-south-east, and south and by east,
distant 11 or 12 leagues.

II. To sail the coast along from Cape de Hague to S. Malo.
Between Cap de la Hague and the Island of Ornay, the Rasse of Blanckart or
Ornay runs in, from whence a man may sail through the Islands in diverse
manners to S. Maloes, as hereafter follows and also along the coast by
Granville and Concale.

First from Cape de la Hague or Hagu, to Cape de Vorha, Cape de Vorha.
it is s. s. e. and south and by east about 8 leagues. From Cape de Hague there
shoots of a rock, which you must be careful to shun.

Buf-rocks
When you are past Cape de Vorha, then you shall find three or four high rocks
called the Buff, you may go about betwixt them and the firm land east and
west: as also between the Rocks and Iarsey, to the Riffe of Sand called
Mortefam. Martefam.


From Cap de Vorha to the said Riffe of Mortefam the course is south-south-east
8 leagues.

Against this Riffe there lies a row of Rocks reaching east and west more
the^ a league into the Sea. Those that are most easterly lie above the water,
these Rocks are called Bufkin. Bufkin.


Being past Buff, you leave on your right hand, (as you do all other rocks,)
a great row of Rocks which reach out from the southeast point of Iarsey to
Granville, which are called Eckron, Eckron,
all these rocks you leave on your right hand.

He that sayleth to Granville between Buff and Iarsey, let him understand that
he may anckor well under the north end of Iarsey at 11 or 12 fathom.

But coming by the sand or riffe of Mortefam, there you must sail s. s. e.
forward to Granville, between Mortefam and Bufkin.

Right south from this riffe of Mortefam there stands a church with two
steeples, called Quotanse. Quotanse.


From the Rock Bufkin to the utter point of Granville Granville.
it is southeast 6 or 7 leagues, about the south point there lie two or three
little rocks, going about behind them you go behind a stone or head, where at
low water you sit dry.

You must understand that between Cape de Hague and Granville the coast is
full of houses, milles and trees, and that you may anckor all along by that
coast at 6 and 7 fathom, specially on the south side of Cape de Hague. The
Cape of Vorha and Granville are two points shooting or reaching out.

About five leagues southward of Granville, there lies an Island about a league
from the firm land, whereon the castle or little town of S. Michaels Mont S.
Michael.
lies, having a high tower which may be seen far off, lying before the
river of Averentie, which falls dry into the Sea, at least a league long, so
that from the strand you may see no Sea.

And about west from Granville lie the rocks of Sausee or Santsee, Sausee or
Santsee.
which are about 3 leagues long, reaching east and west.

From Granville to the point of Concale Concale.
the course is southwest 5 leagues: you must run in close by the point for
there it is 8 or 9 fathom deep, there lie three rocks off from the point,
before them you may anckor at 10 fathom, but before the town it is shallowe
water.

There lie two rocks also on the north side of the town, under them you may
anckor at 5 or 6 fathom.

Within the rocks to Mount S. Michael it is very rising ground, of 13, 9, and
6 fathom, it is all one, so that at a low water the whole shore is dry as I
said before.

From the uttermost rock of Concale to the East haven of S. Maloes S. Maloes.
west, and w. and by s. it is 5 leagues.

There lies a little Island before the haven, whereon there stands a church
called Sicember, you may sail in on both sides thereof.

The east chanel The east-chanel.
goes in by a high sharp rock, called the Meeusteen, and so you sail upon the
west Island, then you see two small Islands or rocks more, and on each of them
there stands a little house, which you leave on backborde, sailing upon the
uttermost, and close in by it.

When you are within the cliffes or rocks, whereon the houses stand, then you
may anckor at 5 or 6 fathom low water. This east chanel reaches south in,
and upon the west land in the Baye against S. Maloes, there are three or four
little houses, which in sailing in you must keep close upon the two aforesaid
Islands whereon the houses stand, and you must sail right up upon them, until
you are within the two Islands or rocks, where you may anckor before the town
at 5 fathom.

At a low water it is there all full of rocks and stones, so that there you
can hardly see through them, but sailing in the channels of S. Maloes, at half
flood, you can do no hurt, so you sail not upon any high rocks, for at high
water it is there 14 fathom deep, and it flows every tide 7 fathom high.

The west chanel begins to run in a little westward of Sicember. The
west-chanel of S. Maloes.
Sicember is the Island whereon the little church stands, there westward lie
two or three great rocks, whereby you run in leaving a great rock on
starborde, running in close by the rocks that be most northeast and by south,
and e. s. e. till you are against the two rocks whereon the two houses stand,
then turn southward up to the town as aforesaid.

The marks of the west chanel are these, Marks of the west-chanel.
there stands a mill on high upon the way to the town, when that is right
upon the north or east corner of the town of S. Maloes, let it stand so til
you come to the aforesaid Islands with houses.

The south chanel of S. Maloes, The south chanel of S. Maloes.
runs along by the land between it and the rocks, where you leave all the
rocks to seaward, keeping the west point of the haven right against the south
corner of the town, so that between the town and the Islands you may see the
place whereon the milles stand, and so you run upon the point of the haven
in, and close in by the point, and when you are at the point, then you may
ankor in the Baye where the houses stand, at five fathom low water, in the
middle of the haven there lie two or three sands, stone ground which you must
shun.

At S. Maloes an east and west moon makes a high water, and the stream
falls into the west haven, through the cliffes or rocks, and out again at
the east chanel: which you must mark well when you go in at the west chanel
of S. Maloes.

III. The situation from S. Maloes to S. Paul's de Lion.
ABout five leagues west from the south chanel of S. Maloes there lies a great
sandy Baye, where a man may lie safe from all winds, at 6 or 7 fathom, you
anckor under a great cliffe or rock, turning westwards up toward the milles
with the trees.

And almost three leagues northwest from this foresaid Sandbay lies Cape de
Farelle, Cape de Farelle.
which also is called Cape de Late, because the castle la Late stands east
from this point, there also is a good Rode for a west and southwest wind.

West from Cape de Farelle lies a great cliffe or rock, and west from it you
may anckor in the great Sandbaye.

You may know Cape de Farelle by the aforesaid rock, there are many Sand bays
also in the strand, and upon the point stands a great castle.

From Cape de Farelle to the north end of the Island Briack Island of Briack.
it is west and by north 13 or 14 leagues.

Between them both there lies the Havens or Rivers of S. Brieux and Benit, S.
Brieux. S. Benit.
and about west from Cape de Farelle there lies a great row of out-rockes
above the water, two leagues from the land.

Two leagues northwest from S. Maloes chanel lies the east banck, right over
against Cape de Farelle, there you may ride under at 6 or 7 fathom.

You shall know the Island of Briack when you come out of the east by two
milles which stand upon the land about two cables length one from the other,
and between the two milles there stands a high round hill, and on it a
house, it reaches south-south-west, and n. n. e. almost 3 leagues in length.

You may sail round about this Island, and anckor when you will, it is al good
ground, although there lie some rocks round about it, as one a great way from
the north point, called Souffe, which you must take heed of, and beware also
of a row of rocks at the north end, lying under the water.

In the Trave of Iarsey, Rockedove, and the Island Briack it is 20, 25 and 30
fathom.

West-south-west a league and an half from the Island Briack lie the Out-rockes
of Pickels, Pickels rocks.
which you may sail round about. They lie 4 leagues from the firm land, and
east near to the firm land there lie many blind rocks which you must shun.

Four leagues west from Briack, lies Portblanke Port bla^c.
upon a great river called Lantriliers, East from this haven lie many
Out-rockes, you may sail between them at 6 or 7 fathom with a low water,
about behind the Seven Islands, and come westward by the Green Island into the
Sea again.

From Pickels aforesaid to the Seven Islands it is 8 leagues east and by north,
Sept Isles.
and w. and by s. you cannot sail through nor between those Seven Islands, but
between the firm land and the Seven Islands, there runs a white chanel
through.

The Seven Islands are to be sailed upon at 45 fathom, and when you are against
them then you see a steeple upon the firm land, whereby they are well to be
known, this church is called Our Lady of Brightness.

And from the Island which lies furthest east there shoots off a Sand, at the
end whereof there lies a rock, for a good mark to sail about this Sand.

Above a league south from Seven Islands lies the Green Island otherwise called
Tabeliuck, Green Island. Taveliuc.
which may be sailed round about, and from thence runs the deep to the
Driakelpotten northwest into the Sea.

The Seven Islands are about 8 or 9 leagues long, and northwest from the west
end of them, there lies a rock under the water which at low water is above
it.

From these Islands to Driakelpotten Driakelpottes.
the course is west-south west, and e n. e. 5 leagues, these are all mighty
and fearful Out-rockes, spreading out far and broad, and lie without the
coast of the land about five or six leagues.

Between the Driaklepotten and the Sept Isles lies the river of Laminoe, and
east from it the Green Island or Taveliuc, which may be anckored round about.

The haven behind the Green Island is called Ulles haven, Vlles haven.
to sail into it you must leave Taveliuc on backborde, and you must go in
south, it is a great creek, then the river will open it self, but you must
take heed of the northside of the river for it is foul.

To know the Driaklepotten, you shall see a high steeple standing upon the
land, although there it must be clear wether before you can have any sight of
the land.

Along by this coast it is 50 and 45 fathom deep, and you may easily see the
land, so that in the night time you may come no nearer unto it then 45 fathom.

He that comes from Voert and will sail to S. Maloes, must go no nearer
east with a south wind, then east-northeast, but if the wind be west then go
n. e. and by e. until you have Driaklepotten on your side, otherwise the flood
would draw you thither, the flood falls there northwest and southeast in
behind the Seven Islands, but by day there is no danger when you can see.

Behind the Driaklepotten lies the haven of S. John de Doye, S. John de Doye.
almost three leagues westward from the Green Island, and as much eastward from
Morlions, it is a tyde-haven, from thence you may go to Morlions through the
rocks, and anckor at 5 or 6 fathom low water.

West from the Driaklepotten or pottes, lies a great rock: about s. w. and by
s. from the same lies the east chanel of Morlions, Morlions.
about 4 leagues distant.

West-southwest, and west and by south from the aforesaid rock, 5 or 6 leagues
lies the west chanel of Morlions, running in by a long craggie rock, you may
sail into this chanel south, and south and by west, to the castle of Morlaix,
The castle of Morlaix
and being about the castle you may sail eastward on through the rocks, and
go from the long rock n. n. e. and n. and by e. out of the east have^ into the
Sea again, as the stream serves. The flood comes from the northwest.

Being within the castle of Morlaix, and desiring to go to Morlions they sail
east through the rocks, it is al broken land, where with low water it is five
fathom deep. But if you will put into S. Paul's de Lion, S. Paul de Lion.
then sail to the great rock with the two horns or saddle, and sail close
along by the rock, and when you have gotten about the rock, then choose your
land, there lies a village upon the land called Plainpoul, Plainpoul.
sail to it, for there eastward the river goes in. These are all tyde-havens,
but between the rock of Morlions and the Island called Bas, it is deep enough
at low water to hide a ship.

IIII. The situation of the land between S. Paul de Lion and Heysant.
TO know the land of S. Paul you must understand that it is dubble land, and
that there stand two speere steeples upon the church, and upon the Island de Bas
there stand two stakes up, like unto milles, it lies cross before them. This
Island at the east end has a high craggie rock, and when you are east from
this rock, then you may see two speere steeples standing a little the one from
the other, which are the steeples of Plainpoul, and you shall also see the
castle of Morlaix lying southeast from you, upon a high rock.

The aforesaid uttermost craggie rock of Morlaix lies from the point of the
Island de Bas east, and east and by south 4 or 5 leagues, you may run along
between the firm land and these rocks to Seven Islands, and in many places it
is good anckor ground, for they are all great creekes, and between the rocks
of Morlions and the Island de Bas it is deep enough at a low water to hide a
ship, you may go in on both sides of the Island de Bas at 7 or 8 fathom with a
low water, and anckor where you will.

Thus the land of S. Paul shows it self to the Four toe, when you sail along
by it four leagues from the land.

S. Paul de Lion. Obrevrack. Le Four.

view of Saint-Pol-de-Leon

Behind the I Will de Bas lies the town of Roscou, which has many great
ships, because the water is deep there.

To go into the east chanel, East chanel.
when you are past the high rock, and come against the point of the firm land,
you must go in between it and the I Will de Bas, about west, and west and by
south, and anckor at half way the low Island de Bas, at 8 or 9 fathom then
you lie in the haven of Roscou.

To go into the west chanel, West have or chanel.
which goes in by the land of Voert, you shall see two great long rocks lying
westward, close by the firm land, and from the point of the land right east of
the easterlyest long rock, there goes a Sand off from the firm land, which is
the west side of the west haven of Roscou, which runs in by the west end of
Isle de Bas, about southeast, and when you are within, then turn northeast up
under the Island, there is the best Rode, then Roscou will lie south, and south
and by east from you.

It is from the Island de Bas to Voert or Bacovens w. s. w. and w. and by s.
about 13 leagues. But from Roscou to Abbewrack Abewrack
it is almost 7 leagues.

About northwest a league without the rocks of Abbewrack lies a row of
rocks under the water, therefore those that put by night out of Voert, or that
will laveere to the Four, must go no nearer to the land of Abbewrack then 4.5
fathom.

To know the land about the Voert, there lies many white pieces of land, as
if they were Sandbayes, and along to the Voert many long rocks, like as if
they were villages, and upon the land you may see some houses standing, whereby
this land is well to be known.

La Four and Heysant are distant almost 3 leagues, west-south west, and
east-northeast.

V. To sail between the Voert and Heysant through Conquet and Fontenay. Also
the situation of al Creekes, Havens, and Rodes lying there aboutes.
THe Voert or Backovens, Bacovens.
in French called le Four, Le Four,
is known by many out rocks which stand like black villages, and in the
firm land there are many Sandbayes.

And you shall know Heysand, Heysant.
for that at the south end it goes most part sloping down, and in the middle
you see a small flat steeple, as the figure enseuing show you.

Thus Heysant shows it self when it is s. and by e. from you about 4 leagues.

Thus Heysant shows it self when it is s. e. from you about 4 leagues.

view of Heysant When Heysant is e. n. e. from you about three leagues it
shows thus.

Heysant three or four leagues n. n. w. from you shows thus.

view of Heysant

From the Four to S. Mathewes S. Mathewes.
point it is s. s. e. 4 leagues. He that will sail to Voert he must run
close by the land of Voert or le Four, there lie rocks like black villages or
houses along by the land, and behind them are many white Sandbayes (as I have
said before, showing how to know the land) sail close along by the rocks, til
you come to the point. Upon the point there lie also two rows of small rocks,
which you may pass along by at half the length of a pieces shot, or the length
of two cables, and when you are about the point you shall see three heaps of
rocks lying each a quarter of a league from the other, sail along close by
them because of the north Hagles, which lie between Heysant and the Four.

When you are against the middlemost heap of rocks, then hold S. Mathewes
Closter under the point of Conquets-ort or corner, and sail right upon it
until you be close upon the point, without turning far from it, because of
the Bellaert, which lies cross over about two cables length from the said
point and with a spring tide is above water.

And when you are by Conquets-ort or corner run a cables length along by the
same until you see the haven open, Conquet.
but take good heed of the Fenestiers Fenestiers.
which lie a cables length from the land, on the east point or side of Conquets
haven.

Bus if you desire to go into Conquets haven, then when you come close by
Conquets-ort or corner bring S. Mathewes Closter without Conquets-ort, and then
sail upon the Blanck Moines, until S. Mathewes Closter be east-southeast from
you, sail then to it, right before S. Mathewes Closter, Rode before S.
Mathewes Closter.
and there anckor at 6 or 7 fathom, there is the best Rode for those that will
go northward. But he that must go into Voert and laveere, he must not bring
S. Mathewes Closter far without Pascaarte vande Zeecuste^ en^ lande^ van

against the northwest end of the northerlyest Cheminees or Kimmenesses then
you are against the Hagles. Halman. Marks of the Hagles


He that will sail into Breest water, Breest water.
must understand, that about a league eastward of S. Mathewes point there lies
a rock which he must shun. To sail into Breest water from S. Mathewes point
go e. s. e. and keep the north end of the southerlyest Kiminesses without S.
Mathewes point, so long until that the mill upon the north land is north from
the trees, then sail southward by the rock, and so you cannot err. You may
sail within two cables length along by the north land, until that Breest is
without the point, and then sail up to it. Or if you will sail otherwise into
Breest water, northward of the rock aforesaid, which lies about a league
within S. Mathewes point right against Bartrams Baye, then keep the north land
well, and hold the southerlyest Kimmenesse covered behind the great rock which
lies off from S. Mathewes point, and so sail upon the west point of Bartrams
Baye, until that the mill which stands upon the north land be n. w. and by
n. and the trees n.n.w. from you, then you are past the stone. But it is best
to go southward by the stone, it lies about half a piece shot from the north
land. If you will go into the haven of Breest, then sail most part along by
the north land, so long till that you come upon the point of Breest. When the
south point of Breest water is right against the point of Croduin, Baghin
rocks.
then you are against Baghin, which are a row of rocks lying in the mouth of
Breest water, about two cables length from the north side, and at a low water
are seen, being there within, you may turn up eastward or southward before
the rivers of Landerneau or Lefou, and anckor there against the south land, at
10, 12, and 13 fathom, before the little town called old Croduyn. Breest water
for the most part reaches in east-northeast, there it flows every tide
three fathom up and down, and a southwest and by west, and northeast and by
north moon there makes a high water.

He that lies within Breest, must pay about twelve pence for anckor money,
Croixduin.
and for that you have a bill to signify that you are free there, so that if
you lose your ship upon the coast of Britanie, you might there freely lay
hold on your goods, otherwise it is not free: there you lie at anckor in the
Sea at 8 or 9 fathom, and at land your ship is made fast with a rope at a tree.

To sail from S. Mathewes point to Claesduinen or Croduin, keep the
southerlyest Kimmenesses without the Blanck Moines, and go forward e.s.e.
until you come to the west point of Claesduynen, and when you are about the
point, and may see the Baye open, then you shall see a church stand upon a
piece of land distant from the maine, run up to it, and anckor about the
church at 6 or 7 fathom. Croduin is a great Creek, and lies almost 3 leagues
distant from S. Mathewes point, right over against Croduin lies Bartrams Baye,
Bartrams baye.
there you may anckor safe against a north, and n. w. wind, at 10 or 11
fathom.

The Cheminees Cheminees.
or Kimmenesses lie southward from Heysant, and westward from S. Mathewes
point: between the Kimmenesses and Heysant, a ship that will may well sail
through, it is there 6 or 7 fathom deep with low water. If a man by reason
of the flood cannot sail above Heysant and the Cheminees, he may well sail
through between them (as I said before) it is there broad and deep enough, the
chanel reaches about n. e. and s. w. and going in the middle of the water you
cannot err.

He that will sail over the Trave from S. Mathewes point to the Emperor and
Emperesse, must have good regard to the rocks which lie between them. The
Colengier Colengier.
lies from S. Mathewes point s. s. e. almost two leagues.

The Hen with her Chickens, Hen with her Chickens.
and the middlemost Foukenesses lie from S. Mathewes point s.e. and by e.
almost 2 leagues.

The Foukenesses lie from the west point of Croduyn about w. s. w. almost half
a league.

The southerlyest Foukenesse Foukenesses.
lies from the northerlyest half a league, or two shootes of a piece, and at a
high water it is covered: and n. n. e. a cables length from it there lies a
blind rock, which at allow water is also seen. The said southerlyest
Foukenesse lies southwest and by south from Croixduin. There lies also
another blind rock, westward from the northerlyest Foukenes, which also at a
low water is uncovered.

The Hen lies w. s. w. a pieces shot and an half from Foukenesse, it is a
round sharp rock, which round about is deep and fair, at 6 and 7 fathom. The
Chickens The Chickens.
lie a bases shot n. w. and by w. from the Hen, which are two sharp stumpes,
which with low water are even above the water, and lie about west from the
northerlyest Foukenesse.

The Scheminkel hills lie southward from the Foukenesses, Scheminckle bergen
or rocks.
you may run between them at 10 fathom, to the west point of Croduin, there
also is good rode and anckor ground.

The Ras of Fontenay Rasse of Fontenay.
lies from S. Mathewes point south and by east five leagues, if you will sail
from S. Mathewes point over the Trave in the Ras of Fontenay, then go south
and by east, and hold the mill of Fenestiers, which stands upon the east
point of Conquets haven, over the point of S. Mathewes Closter, as long as you
can see it, and when you come before the Emperor Emperor.
and the Emperesse, shun the Emperor, because of the rocks thereof which lie
under the water, and beware also of the Emperesse, Emperesse
for from it also there runs a sand called the Calf, Calf.
over which the stream breaks very much, and falls very stiff from it,
therefore mark your streams here well, for the stream runs cross over
this Ras of Fontenay, so that with a southwest wind, and an out fall or ebb
it is very dangerous to put into that chanel, as also with a calm. This
chanel runs through s. s. w.

The Seims stand a little south from the Emperor, and reach about 3 leagues w.
n. w. into the Sea, Seims rocks.
and about northwest from them lies a rock which you must shun.

Between the said Seims and Heysant, reaches Breesand Breesond.
in e. n. e. against the which reaches that of S. Mathewes point into the Sea,
w. n. w. five leagues.

East from Fontenay or the Emperesse lies Friesebaye, Friese bay.
there you may anckor against a s. e. and by s. wind, there is good anckor
ground.

And further east from Friese-baye lies Boldavids baye, Boldavids baye.
a deep wide baye reaching in e. n. e. on the east side of the haven there lie
two Islands or rocks, which you may anckor under, there you may lie safe from
all winds.

VI. The running of the streams, and what Moon makes a high water there.
A South and by east moon makes a high water at Cap de Hague by land.

In the Ras of Blankaert or Ornay the flood falls s. w and the ebb
northeast, but here you can reckon no falling of streams, for one quarter of
a tide the flood falls cross into the Casquettes, forth of the one haven
into the other, and so out again, but most northeast, and n. e. and by n.
through the Islands, where a n. and by e. and s. and by w. moon makes a full
Sea. In Garnsey also it is high water with a n. and by e. and s. and by w.
moon.

At Concalo and Granville a w.n.w. moon makes highwater

At S. Maloes the streams ru^ne in at the westchanel through the rocks, and
run out again at the east chanel, which a man must remember when he will go
into S. Maloes.

An east and west moon makes a high water at S. Maloes.

From the Island of Briack in the creek or haven of Benit the stream falls
south-east, but in the chanel it falls e. s. e. and w. n. w. an east and west
moon makes high water there.

Behind the Casquettes the tide turns against the Son, so that there it is
never still water.

On the east side of the Island of Briack, in the chanel in the Rode, the flood
goes s.s.e. and a west moon makes high water.

Between Garnsey and the Island of Briack in the chanel, the stream falls
e.s.e. and w.n.w. and it is there full Sea with a west-south-west moon.

Between the Sept-Isles and Garnsey a w.s.w. moon also makes a high water in
the chanel.

Between Briack and the SeptIsles the stream falls west, and west and by
north, and a w. and by s. moon makes a full Sea.

Between the Seven Islands and the out-rockes of Morlions the flood falls in
behind the Driaklepottes, to the Greene-Iland, and falls in s.s.w. but in
the chanel it falls most east, and e. and by n. and at Morlaix and S. Paul's a
w. and by s. moon makes a high water, and in the chanel a southwest and by
west, and a west southwest moon.

At Sept-Isles and S. Paul de Lion a w. and by s. moon makes a high water.

From Morlions or the Island de Bas to Voert the stream falls w. and by s.
and a w.s.w. and w. and by s. moon makes high water there. Without Heysant a
w.s.w. moon makes a high water, and within the Voert a s. w. and by w. moon.

Without the Isle de Bas in the chanel the stream falls east-northeast, and
w.s.w.

The flood falls very stiff upon Heysant, and through the Chimenees cross
over the Voert to the Bacovens, he that comes to sail about Heysant he must
be careful hereof.

Before S. Mathewes point a s. w. and by w. moon makes a high water. From the
Four to S. Mathewes point the ebb faleth south and by east, and the flood
north and by west.

In Bresondt between Heysant and the Seims a w.s.w. moon makes a high water.
The flood runs into Breesond toward Breest, it falls also by S. Mathewes
point in toward Backovens, and it raketh there very much.

The flood falls through very stiff between the Emperor and falls
thwartwise over to the Emperesse, and so falls with great rakings over the
Calf, which is a rock, which stretches of from the Emperesse, and then falls
forward also north, and north and by west into S. Mathewes point. But every
one that will sail through this way must be wary least he be carried away
with the stream in calm wether, and with a storm out of the north or south
it is not good to come into this chanel with an out or in-fall. A southwest and
by south, and a northeast and by north moon makes a high water.

Upon all the coast of Britanie, Poictou, and Gascoigne a southwest and a
northeast moon makes a high water, and there they make no reckoning of any
falling of the stream.

VII. Of the depths against these places, and at what depths a man may see
these countries.
Without the Kiscasses about three leagues from the land it is 35 and 40
fathom deep, there is also a pit about n. n. e. 4 leagues from Garnsey
where it is 80 or 90 fathom deep, otherwise it is deep there aboutes 40
fathom.

About four leagues from Garnsey, when it lies southeast from you, it is 40
fathom deep.

About the Driaklepottes along the coast it is 50 and 45 fathom, and at such a
depth a man may see the land but by night you must come no nearer to it then 45
fathom.

You may well run to the Sept Isles at 45 fathom.

Between Ornay and Iarsey it is 20 and 28 fathom deep.

Against the Sept Isles about 5 or 6 leagues from the land it is 40 and 45
fathom.

Against S. Paul's de Lion about five leagues from the land it is 45 and 50
fathom.

Against Isle de Bas, and Abbewrac, or Marwanen five leagues from the land it
is 50 and 55 fathom.

At the Backovens or the Four a man may see the land at 15 fathom, and you may
know it by many out-rockes, which stand like black villages, and in the
firme-land there are many Sandbayes. And you shall know Heysant because at
the southende it goes slope downwards, and in the middle you see a small
flat tower, and southeast from the same Island five or six leagues from the
land it is 75 fathom deep, and you may see the land from the poope of the
ship.

Upon S. Mathewes point there stands a flat tower, and coming out of the
Sea, you may see that flat tower over the Kimenesses.

At the Seims and the Sheets you may see the land at 60 and 65 fathom. The
Seims reach west-northwest from the Emperor into the Sea, and about a mile from
thence northwest, there lies a rock which you must shun, and right there
without it is 50 fathom deep. In Breesond it is 45 fathom deep. North from
Heysant it is 50 fathom deep, and you may also see the land. Without the
Seims it is 55 fathom deep, and then you may see the sheets also.

X. Under what degrees these places lie.
THe Casquettes or Kiscasses lie under 49 degrees 48 min. The Sept Isles lie
under 49 degrees. Heysant lies under 48 degrees 30 minutes. The Seims lie
under 48 degrees 5 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 5.
CHAPTER V. HOW A MAN MAY sail along by the Coast of Britanie and Poictou,
from Seims to the Island of S. Martin together with all the Rivers, Havens, and
Islands, lying in and about the same Coast.
I. The situation of the land between Seims and Blauet.
THe Seims Seims.
(as in the chapter aforegoing is declared) are right southward from the
Emperor, and west-northwest almost 3 leagues into the Sea. From the uttermost
of the Seimes to the Westpenmarques it is east-south-east and somewhat
southerlyer about 13 leagues. But from the Ras or from Fontenay to
Westpenmarques the course is southeast 9 leagues.

Between them both lies Odegerne Odegerne.
a fair haven, about five leagues east-southeast from Fontenay, right before
the channel or haven there lies a banck, which you may run by on both sides
at six fathom. The south point of this haven is shallowe, therefore sail in
by the east side, and there you have not less then three fathom at low water.

The knowledge of the land between Fontenay and Odegerne is two round hills,
which the Hollanders call the Slaeplakens, that is the Sheets, Sheets.
westward from which there stand two milles, it is a very craggie point, which
without the Seims you may well see at 55 fathom, whereby this land is well to
be known.

From Odegerne southeast and by south lie the Westpenmarques, Westpenmarques.
which are good to know, for such as have once seen the^, for on the
southeast end there stands a thick flat steeple, and a little westward
there stands a speere steeple, and yet somewhat more westerly against the
high land there stands a village like a castle, at the east side whereof there
stands a flat steeple, there lie two great rocks close by the land.

The Westpenmarques run from the firm land more then a league southeast into
the Sea, you sail east into them, leaving all the rocks on the left hand,
running along by the strand, until you come by a great rock, which you must
sail southward about, leaving it on your right hand, then you turn up
north-northwest, and so anckor right within the rock, at three fathom low
water, then you can see no Sea, but at a low water it rolleth very hard
through the rocks.

You may from thence run at a high water southeast between the rocks into
the Sea again, but you must take good heed. Without the great rock in the
entry of the haven it is ten fathom deep, so that a man might there hide a
great ship if need were.

Thus the Slaeplakens or the Sheets with Westpenmarques show themselves when
you sail along by them, and are about four leagues cross from them.

Fontenay. Odegerne. Westpenmarques,

view of Penmarch

From the Westpenmarques to Eastpenmarques or Glenant Eastpenmarques. Glenant.
the course is east-southeast, southward about, with such a course you may
run far enough without, and behind the Eastpenmarques lies a haven called
Bindet, Binde^.
the east end whereof is full of rocks, you enter into that haven by these
marks: there stands a mill far within the land, which comes over
against a little Castle which stands upon a point within the haven, which you
must hold standing one over the other, that is the east mill, and go in
northeast and northeast and by north, and so you can get no hurt on neither
side of the land, and then anckor against the town, you may also sail behind
the Eastpenmarques, Rode behind the Eastpenmarques.
the firm land is sandy strand, where you may anckor at 10 or 11 fathom,
nearest the Island of Motten which is very fair.

A league southwest from Gloyland, by us called the Eastpenmarques, there lies
a great rock under the water, whereon it raketh continually, within and without
this rock it is 40 fathom deep, and when you go east-southeast from the
Westpenmarques then you run far enough without them.

Thus the land of Eastpenmarques shows it self when you sail by it.
view of Penmarch

About two leagues eastward of Glenant lie the Islands of Motten, Motten.
you may sail between them and the firm land to Groye or Blauet, there it is
9 or 10 fathom deep. But if you will go through between Glenant and Motten,
sail along by the Island of Motten, till you are without Glenant, and then
sail whither you would be.

Thus the land eastward of Glenant or Gloyland to Groye when you sail along by
it, opens it self.
view of Glenan

From Motten to Groye Groye.
the course is east and by south eight leagues. To know Groye, you must
understand that there stand three or four milles upon it, and the east end
goes slope downwards, whereby it is easy to be known.

When Groye is n. n. e. from you four leagues it shows thus.
view of Groix

Under Groye it is good anckoring for a southwest wind, at 6 or 7 fathom,
though at the southeast end of Groye there lies a Sand, which you must beware
of, for there it is foul ground.

Right behind the Island of Groye lies the haven of Blauet Blauet.
which runs in northeast and by north, at 4 or 5 fathom, upon the west side
of this haven there stands a high speere steeple called Quinperley. To sail
into Blauet
The Barse lies on the east side of the haven, which is a rock which comes
off from the east side of the haven. On the east side also there lie two blind
rocks which you must be very wary of as you enter in, you must sail in
along by the west side. When you are within it is wide and broad, you may there
anckor before the Island which lies in the middle of the haven at 5 or 6
fathom, it is 3 or 4 fathom deep at low water.

II. The situation of Bel-Isle and the Islands lying there abouts, also the
Creekes of Morbeam and Croisil or Croiswyke.
FRom Westpenmarques to Bel-Isle Bel-Isle.
or Boelin, the course is east-southeast 21 leagues. But from Groye to Bel-Isle
it is south-southeast 5 leagues. To know Bel-Isle you must understand that on
the northwest end it has a rugged point, wherein there is a great saddle, you
may also see some houses there upon the land, and the east end goes whole
sloping down, you may see it at 55 fathom.

Thus Belisle opens it self when the northwest end is east from you about
four leagues.

When Belisle is northeast from you 4 leagues then it shows ihus.

view of Belle Isle

He that will seek harbor under Belisle, must shun the northwest end, for
there under the water there lies a rock a good way from the land. When you
are there within, then you sail about two towes length along by the land, and
within a bases shot about by the north point, Rode under Bel-Isle.
till you come to the village with the speere steeple, called S. Paul's, there
stands a castle upon the point, westward from the aforesaid steeple, anckor
within the point at 9 or 10 fathom, then you lie safe from a south, southwest,
west, and northwest winds, if it blows any thing northerlyer you may remove
before the east end, which is half a league broad, at 10 and 11 fathom, the
Island reaches s. e. and n. w. and as the wind blows so a man must remove
from one Rode to another, it is good lying there. There lie many Islands
behind Bel-Isle, Islands behind Bel-isle.
but you may sail behind them to Groye, and Morbeam, in some places having
good Rodes, and specially the middlemost which has a good haven, which goes
in by a great rock, but to sail through there and back again, a man must have
some knowledge thereof, because there lie many rocks both above and under the
water. The east-Iland is called the Cardinal, Cardinal.
and is distant from the east-ende of Bel-Isle e.n.e. and e. and by n. about 4
leagues, they lie 3 leagues from the firm land, where there lie two great
creekes or rivers, from whence a man may sail through between the firm land,
and the aforesaid Islands lying behind Bel-Isle to Croiswyke or Croixisle, and
also up the River of Nantes called Loire.

He that will sail into Morbeam Morbeam.
let him go from the east-Iland called the Cardinal, to the Mayland n.w. and
n.n.w. there it is deep 8 or 9 fathom, then go somewhat northerlyer upon the
point which lies west from S. Iolme and run in by it, within the point it is
6, or 7, and also 8 fathom deep. When you are within the point, leave the
west-point and run close in by the east-point, and as soon as you are within
the west-point of the haven, then take good heed to your stream, for the
flood falls very stiff into the river of Faunes, then choose the west-land
at 6 or 7 fathom, there it is all shallowe, and when the steeple of Morbeam
upon the West-land is west from you, then anckor in the middle of the haven at
9 fathom, then Aury the innermost steeple lies n. n. w. from you, and the
other steeple n. and by e. but the point of Mayland e. s. e.

The little Island that lies in the Sea lies e. s. e. and w. n. w. from the
west-point of the haven, and the land from the haven to S. Iolmes steeple n.w.
and s.e. and so to Croiswyke w.n.w. and e.s.e.

This Island aforesaid lying without the haven of Morbeam, on the north-ende is
foul, you must leave it on the left hand, and run to the point of the
Mayeland, and close in by it as aforesaid, in the Trave it is 6, 7, and 8
fathom deep.

From the east-ende of Bel-isle to Crois-isle the course is east and by north,
Croixisle.
and east-northeast about 11 leagues.

But he that will sail from Blauet to Morbeam, he may sail through behind
Groye and the Islands lying behind Bel-isle, and when he is within the Islands,
he must go north-northeast, till he be before the haven of Morbeam. Before it
there lies a rock or an Island, as I said before, you must sail in through the
rock and the east-land, to the east-ende of the haven, and you must shun the
west-point at 6 fathom, for it is shallowe: the east side is deepest, till you
come somewhat within, then there lies a rock which at half flood is above the
water, you must go east, or west about it, and anckor right behind the rock,
making a towe fast on land, or as you come within the west-point, you may turn
westward as I said before, until the village of Morbeam be west from you, and
there anckor at 9 fathom.

I said before that the land of the east-point of this haven to S. Iolmes
steeple reaches northwest, and southeast, and from S. Iolmes to Croiswyke
west-northwest, and east-southeast, along by the land it is about 7, 8, and 9
fathom deep, the more southward about the deeper, but against the point of
Croixwyke you have six and seven fathom water again, so long until you be
within the banck.

Behind the west point of Croiswyke there is a Rode A Rode behin^e Croiswyke.
as if it were a haven, where you may lie at five, six, and seven fathom
water.

And westward from the northwest-point of Crois-isle there is a flat church
upon the high land. The land of Olduynen Oldu^^^^
lies close north from this church. The church stands upon the first point
of Croixwyke.

Southwest and by south from this church, two leagues from the land, lies a
banck called the Foer, Poer.
which in some places is dry at a low water, it lies a league from the
northwest-point of Croiswyke, and from the east-point of Pulyen west and by
north, and somewhat northerlyer, and from Bel-Isle it lies east, it reaches
in length southwest and northeast, when you keep the steeple of Olduynen over
against the west-point of Croixwyke, and so go east-northeast, then you miss
the banck. And when the speere steeple stands over the height of the
east-ende of the land, then you go northward about the same banck: and when
you bring Pulyen steeple over the northwest-point of Croiswyke or Crois-isle,
then also you run northward about the aforesaid banck. And when you sail
east-northeast from the east-ende of Bel-Isle to Croiswyke, then you go west
about the banck: but when you go east, and east and by south, from the
east-ende of Bel-Isle, then you go east about the banck, sail so long east,
and east and by south on, until that the steeple of CroixIsle or Croiswyke be
north-northwest from you, and then sail to the land, and so forth at two
cables length along by the land, until you see the rock and the haven called
Pierre-passe, then sail close in by it, it is there 4 fathom deep.

But when you come from the Cardinal, then keep the steeple which stands
west from Croixwyke over the point, then you run northward about the banck,
then sail toward the land, about two towes length along by it, as I said
before.

When you come to the east point of Croiswyke, then there shoots a sand off
from the land, Sand of Croiswyk.
which you may sound at three fathom round about. The chanel is 8, 9, and 10
fathom deep.

The westerly steeple is Croiswyke, the high steeple standing eastward is
Pulien.

III. How you may sail into the River of Nantes, and the Baye and the
situation of the Island of Heys
IF you will sail up the River of Nantes, The River of Nantes.
and are within the banck called the Four, then you must run to the land of
Croiswyke, half a pieces shot along by it, until you come to the Rock with
the hole, where you see through as if it were a gate, there in the chanel it is
deep 8 and 9 fathom, but against the rock it is 5 or 6 fathom deep, and
when you go by the north point of the river, it is there 3 and 4 fathom deep
at low water, within to S. Nazaret it is still deeper water, as 5, 6, and 7
fathom. S. Nazaret S. Nazaret
is a sharp steeple standing upon an outpoint, a little within the north point
of the River. The Rock with the hole is called Pierrepasse, from it you must
run at two towes length in, upon the north point of the River, whereon the
sharp steeple called S. Nazaret stands, until you are within the rocks
called les Porceaux, The Pourceaux.
which lie in the middle of the River, between the Rock with the hole and the
steeple aforesaid, and appear above the water at half tide. A little within S.
Nazaret, upon the northland stands a sharp spear steeple, when that steeple
is without the south land, then you cannot hurt your self upon that rock, and
there run northward about. A little eastward there lies another sand with
rocks, where you may run eastward about with great ships, for there it is
very flat to the point: being within the point, you may anckor at 6 or 7
fathom. Eastward from S. Nazaret there lie two villages, between those
villages it is very flat, and stone ground, there you must choose the south
land. But when you are half way between the easterlyest village, then you may
sail upon the point of the village, till you be past it, but against the
easterlyest village on the south side, at the point there lies a banck called
Pinbuf, Pinbuf.
it reaches almost half into the River, yet you may go between the point and
this banck at 5 or 6 fathom, for this is the Rode for ships that will put to
Sea.

A league further inwards in the middle of the River, there lie two banckes of
stones, which at low water are seen above it, these banckes lie in the
chanel. At Pelerin Pelerin.
is the lading place, almost three leagues from Nantes, from whence the wares
come in boats to lade the ships. But this is Pilot water, which you commonly
take in by the aforesaid sharp tower of S. Nazaret, where when you are within,
you may anckor at 10 or 12 fathom, and stay for a Pilot. Those that from S.
Nazaret will go to Sea again, must do as follows, sail along by the
northland, until you come without the second point of the River, turn then
off from the north land into the middle of the River, and sail a great way
southward about Pierrepasse, and then when you may see the rock (which lies
north from Pierrepasse) without the point, there it is four fathom and an half
deep, and when Pierrepasse is north-northwest, and n. and by w. from you, then
you are right against the rock, and there you have deeper water, at 5, 6, and
at last 7 fathom, but when you come into the Trave of Picqueliers, then you
have 10 and 12 fathom water.

Before the River of Nantes there lie many banckes, but at half flood you may
well go over them. And the south point of the River of Nantes, is distant from
the north point, n. n. w. and s. s. e. 4. leagues. Then this land runs into
a great creek, and there men run into the Baye. These uneven banckes in the
River of Nantes are very unlike, sometimes you cast 15 fathom, and presently
after but 7 or 8 fathom.

But to sail from Bel-Isle to the baye of Armentiers, To sail to the baye.
then go on e. s. e. till you see the Closter of Armentiers, but before the
River of Nantes it is uneven and banckie, when you see the Closter of
Armentiers Armentiers.
eastward from the trees which stand into landward beyond the said Closter,
then go forward east, and e. and by n. so long until that the Closter comes
within the castle of Armentiers, then you are within the Monck-lege, Monck-lege.
then go e. s. e. until you are within the rock called Pierremen, Pierremen
which you may go about on both sides, and when you may see the Grave open,
then you may anckor at 7 or 8 fathom, and go on land to fetch a Pilot, for it
is Pilots water. From Bel-Isle to Armentiers the course is e. s. e. about 12 or
13 leagues distant.

From Armentiers to Heys it is south and by east 7 leagues. And from Bel-Isle
to Heys Heys.
it is s. e. 16 leagues. The Island of Picqueliers lies right upon the point of
Armentiers. Between Armentiers or Picqueliers Picqueliers.
and Heys, it is an uneven chanel, with many shallowes and banckes, of 4, 5,
6, and 7 fathom.

To know Heyes you must understand, that you may see it beneath on the
hatches, when you are at 35 fathom in the Sea, on the east end of Heys there
stands a sharp steeple, and some houses and milles, so that it is well to
know.

When you sail along by Heys almost 3 leagues of it shows it self thus.
view of Heys

In the chanel between Heys and Bell Isle it is 35 and 40 fathom, but when you
are within the chanel then it is but 25 fathom deep.

Under Heys there is no great good Rode, Rode under Heyes.
for there it rolleth too much as if the water came from under the Island, and
at the north end it is flat water. The Rode is, when the steeple of the
church is southwest from you, at 8 or 9 fathom, but you lie not safe there but
from a southwest, and a west-southwest wind, and there it raketh always very
much.

From Heyes to the Kiliates, or the Island of S. Marten the course is e. s. e.
12 or 13 leagues. Between them both lies the Barse of Olone, about half a
league from the land of Poictou, but how you must shun it and sail by the
Kiliates is declared in the chapter ensewing.

Thus the land of Poictou shows it self between Heyes and the Island of S.
Marten when you sail along by it, being four leagues from it.

Olone.

view of Poictou

IIII. What Moon makes a high water on these coasts, and of the falling of
the streams.
Upon all the Coasts of Britaigne and Poictou, as also upon all the Islands
there aboutes, a southwest and a northeast moon makes a high water. But
within the Havens, Rivers, Creekes and Bays, a s. w. and by w. and a n. e. and
by e. moon, or a point later, as the Havens or Rivers stretch deeper into the
land, and there you reckon no falling of streams.

V. At what depths you may see the land, about these Coasts and Islands.
AT the Seims and Sheets you may see the land at sixty and five and sixty
fathom.

Against the East and Westpenmarques you may see the land at 55 and 60 fathom.

You may see Belisle at 60 fathom, but then you must run into the shorones
or else to the top of the mast, but at 55 fathom you may see it beneath.

Heys a man may see at 60 fathom with clear wether. You may see S. Martens
Island and the north end of Olderdom or Oleron at 30 and 27 fathom.

VI. How these Lands lie one from the other.
FRom the Ras of Fontenay to Westpenmarques the course is southeast 9 leagues.

east-ende of Belisle to Heys southeast, and somewhat easterlyer 16 leagues.
From Heys to the Barse of Olone e. and by s. 7 leagues. From Heys to the
Kiliates or S. Martens Island e.s.e. 12 or 13 leag.
VII. How these Countries are distant from other Countries.
FRom the Seims or Fontenay to the Krage of Oleron s. e. and by e. 72 leagues.

CHAPTER VI. A TRVE DESCRIPTION of the Seacoasts of France and Biscayen,
between the Island of Heys, S. John de Luz and Cabo de Massichaco.
I. To sail into the Kiliates and Porthus, and so to Brouwage: as also the
situation of Mamm^sont.
THe Kiliates or S. Martens Island is distant from Heys east-southeast 12 or 13
leagues. If you will sail to Kiliates then run east and by south, and
east-southeast, till you be past the Baers of Olone, Baerse of Olone.
which lie about two leagues from Olone, and east and by south 7 leagues from
Heys, so that it lies right in the chanel, and because it is nothing else but
rocks and stones, therefore it is not good to go to near to it in dark
wether, you may well sail round about them, and at low water they are seen.
He that will sail from Heys to Kiliates To sail into the ^^^iates.
within through the Baers, first he must hold his course east, and being within
the Baers of Olone, then sail to that land of Poictou, that reaches from
Olone to S. Martens Island east-southeast, and from Olone to the Picqueliers
n.w. then sail by the land of Poictou, and leave two third-partes of the water
to S. Martens Island, and one third-part toward the firm land, and sail in
this sort so long until S. Martens church be s. s. w. from you, then you may
go well over the banck before S. Martens Banc^ before S. Martens.
and anckor at 5 or 6 fathom. But when the church aforesaid is south and by
west from you, (for on that side of the Island so far inwards it is all
banckie) then the chanel is deep there 12 fathom, and when S. Martens church
is southwest from you, then it is still dryer, then you may well turn toward
the Island at 4 or 5 fathom, as I said before, it dries up there very
quickly, for from 10 fathom you find presently but five or six fathom.

If you will go with a ship that draws much water over the banck which
comes off from the Closter to Urck, then stay till it be half flood, for
upon the banck at low water it is no more then three fathom and two foot
water, but when it is somewhat flowed a great ship may well go over it. When
the steeple of Lisors stands at the north-ende of Urck or Travelenes, then
you are upon the dryest part of the banck: but when the steeple is over the
south-ende of the Island, then it begins to be deep again. The marks to
keep the deepest water when you go over the banck are these: Marks of the
deepest water.
hold the great steeple of Rochell a bow length southward from the boxe-tree
which stands upon the northerlyest height, and so sail over the banck. If
you will anckor in the Rode before the Closter under the banck, then run at
six and seven fathom, and anckor there.

But if you will not anckor under S. Martens, but will go forward to the
Brand-Iland then place the steeple of Lesors or Lussoer over the house which
stands upon the little Island, and keep it so, and then you cannot miscarrie
upon Laverdin. Laverdi^.


The Layerdins are certain rocks lying a quarter of a league from the
east-point of S. Martens Island, and with a low water after a spring-tyde are
seen above the water. You may also sail through between La-verdin and S.
Martens Island, there it is deep enough. The marks of Laverdin are these,
Marks of Laverdin.
when the great steeple of Rochel comes upon the south-point of the Bos, and
that the other point northward from the Bos be right over against the
north-point of the Bos, then you are right upon the Laverdin, so that
whenever you go into the Kiliates, and that Rochell is a ships length
without the point of the Bos, then you are past the Laverdin, then you may
boldly go southeast and by south unto the Brand-Iland.

To sail into Porthus which lies southeast and by east from Heys distant 15
leagues, it is a wide and broad haven; reaching in between S. Martens Island
and Oleron or Olderdom east-southeast. When you will sail into Porthus; To
sail into Porthus.
you must sail along by S. Martens Island, to the east-ende thereof, and then
if you will anckor under the Bos, keep the great steeple of Rochel a ships
length without the Bos, then you cannot be hurt upon Laverdin; but if you will
anckor under the Abbay or Closter of S. Martens Island, then keep the said
Closter without the sandy point of the same Island, and so run into the
sandy bay, on the east side of the closter, and so you sail not also by
Laverdin.

At the north-ende of Oleron lies the Crage, The Crage of Oleron.
which is a very foul dangerous rock, when you sail through between S.
Martens Island and Oleron, and if you go up into the top of the mast, then
you may see it lie in the water, go no nearer to it by night then 12 or 13
fathom.

When you come by the east-ende of S. Martens Island, and sail into Porthus,
and mean to go into Brant Island, Brant-Iland.
then you must sail to it southeast and by east. When the steeple of the Four
is over the Burnt or Brant Island, then you may cast your ballast over board,
there it is 12 fathom deep.

But if you will sail up into the River of Saranten, River of Xarante.
then go southward about the Burnt Island, you may also sail about it
northward, and sail by the steeple of the Four, at a low water this River is
dry four leagues within the land.

To sail from the Burnt Island to Browage, to sail to Brouwage.
sail s. s. e. and keep the little steeple of Heers so long west from the
wood, until the steeple of Four be over against the red tyled house which
stands upon the south side of the river of Sarenten, then sail in southeast,
and sometimes s. e. and by e. until the village of Front which lies upon the
strand be north from Soubise, when Soubise comes within the village
aforesaid, and the mill above the village, then you are against the point of
the east-banck East-ba^ck.
then go southeast and by south, and set the uttermost steeple of Hers upon
the uttermost hillock of sand whereon the Gallows stand, and keep them
standing so, and sail s.s.e, and then when the steeple of Hers comes to the
east-corner of the valley in the wood, then hold that sharp steeple right over
the east-corner of the valley in the wood, and sail so until you are within
the Creek or River of Brouwage. At Brouwage there was sometime no one house
standing, whereas now there is a fair strong town, which has been so within
these fifty years.

The Banjaert Banjaert.
lies along by the land of Oleron, and reaches into the Burnt Island, at a
low water it is above it, and the foot or tail thereof reaches out far
northward. If you must laveere outward from the Creek to the Burnt Island, then
^et not the steeple of Rochel without the Burnt Island, before you are right
against it, because of the Banjaert; for so you can do no hurt to your self.

To sail out of the Sea into the Mammesond, to sail into the Mammesondt.
you must understand that it reaches in east and by north, and e. n. e. and is
deep enough for a great ship, when you come within it there runs up
southeast a river, where you lade salt, going toward Salis, Marks to shu^ne
the Flat.
and when passing by it you come to the other point of Mammesont; then there
lies a Flat, which you must go northward about with these marks: you must
hold the mill which stands upon the land of Oleron over against the trees,
and so you go northward about the Flat, and there is the Rode for those that
will fetch salt at Oleron.

But if you will sail from within out of the River again, to sail from with
in through Porthus.
then you must sail about so long east, until that Salis be over the trees
that stand within Merven. Now to shun the tail, or the Sand which shoots
off from the point of Oleron, when Salis is over against the trees, then sail
north and by west to the Burnt Island, but bring Duke Charles steeple southward
from the Burnt Island, that you may not sail under the Banjaert, when the
steeple of Hers comes upon the wood hold it standing so, until that Rochel
comes over against the north-corner of the Burnt Island, and then sail out at
Porthus. From the west-ende also of S. Martens A Riffe at the west-ende of S.
Martens
Island there shoots out a Sand, which you must shun.

There lies a great row of Rocks in the Sea, upon the which at low water
there is not above 4 or 5 fathom, they are called Wrkamia, Wrckamia
the Sea ravels always much upon them, these Rocks lie south, and s. and by
w. from Heys 13 leagues, from Olone s. w. and w. s. w. from S. Martens Island,
and west from the Island of Oleron.

To know S. Martens Island there stands a high steeple with a high house, and
a mill upon the strand, and you shall see four or five high downs. Upon Oleron
also there stands a high speere steeple upon a red point, whereon you may
see some trees also standing, and southward there are craggie downs in two or
three places.

Thus S. Martens Island shows when it is n. and by e. from you.
view of Saint-Martin-de-Re When you sail into or out of Porthus then S.
Martens Island shows thus.

view of Saint-Martin-de-Re Thus Oleron or Olderdom shows it self, when you
are before Porthus about four leagues from the land.
view of 'Oleron' (town in France)

II. To sail into, and out of the River of Bordeaux.
FRom the Krage of Oleron to the steeple of Cordam Cordam.
it is s. s. e. and south and by east 13 leagues. To know the River you must
understand that the downs that lie east or north from the steeple of Cordam
are five or six white high downs, and that the land southward from it is low
land, black downs overgrowne with heath.

The Monages Monages.
or Monasses reach off from the steeple of Cordam toward the high downs upon
the north-land, which is a small white sand, which you may sound round about at
seven fathom, till you be within the steeple of Cordam, which stands upon
the same Sand, yet the end is very steep, for by the point of Monages it is
20 fathom deep.

To sail up into the River of Bordeaux, called La Garonne, you must understand
that the right chanel reaches in n. e. and by n. till you be at the high
downs upon the north-land, those high downs you must set northeast and by
north from you, and go in n. e. and n. e. and by n. as wind and stream
serves, until you come to a pieces shot about those high downs, then the
castle at Talemont will stand within two ships length southward from the point
of Massy, whereon all the milles stand, and the village of Soulack within the
land, will come within two ships length of the southpoint of the River, keep
the castle that stands upon the Sand two ships length without the point of
Messie, and then go southeast and by east, till you are within the point of
Messie, whereon the milles stand, which is 4 leagues within the River.

To get this haven to get to the haven.
when you come out of the Sea, then know that when the steeple of Cordam
stands e. and by n. from you, and that you ru^ne upon it to the marks
aforesaid, that is, when the high downs upon the north-land, stand n. e. and
by n. from you, then you sail without the South-asses, that is south about
from them, then go to the downs aforesaid n. e. and by n. and so further
inward as I said before, that is the right chanel. But when Cordam steeple is
e. s. e. from you, then you may also run upon it forward through the Asses,
to the marks aforesaid of the high downs, and this chanel is three fathom
deep.

And when the steeple of Cordam is southeast, and s. e. and by e. from you,
there goes also a wide and broad chanel through the North-asses of 2 fathom
deep, which you may also ru^ne into, to the aforesaid marks of the high
downs, and go forward upon them northeast, and n. e. and by n. as aforesaid.

To sail into the south-chanel, How to sail into the south-chanel.
you must know that it runs in by the land: set the steeple of Cordam north
from you, and when Royanen is northeast, and northeast and by north from you,
then the highest steeple comes within a ships length of the middlemost
point of the north-land, and you are upon 5 fathom on the strand, then sail
upon Royan and it will still be dryer, that is four, and also three fathom,
and upon the innermost threshold of the chanel 15 and 16 foot at high water,
then when the house that stands westward of Royan comes into the middle of
the Sandbaye, then ru^ne over the threshold, which being over run to the
point of Missie, within this threshold of the south-chanel it is 20 fathom
deep, and on the south land you may anckor at 6, 7, and 8 fathom.

You may also go into this haven, all sounding with your lead along to
Monages, at 4 and 5 fathom, till you be within the Flat which lies without
the chanel.

There runs a chanel also in by the north, which is very crooked, you must
run to the strand at 4 fathom, and keep along by it, and then coming
against the north-corner of the high downs, there it is two fathom deep at
the deepest, and that is at the threshold of the chanel, but presently after it
will be three fathom again, then you must hold cross off from the land,
until you get deep water, that is 4 or 5 fathom, and being there, run up
to Royan as aforesaid.

Now when you are within the haven, and come against the point of Messie, which
is the point whereon the milles stand, then go over to the broken castle
called Castilion s. e. and by s. which is 8 leagues from Missie, then you must
go along by the south-land southeast into Pouliack, Pouliack
which is almost 3 leagues.

In the chanel between Monages and the point of Missie with the milles, it is
10, 11, and 12 fathom deep: but against the south-chanel it is 20 fathom
deep, but out of the chanel whether it be upon the north or south side it is
dryer as 5, 6, 7, and 8 fathom, you must run along close by the point of
Messie, there also it is 22 fathom deep, and by the point of Monasges it is
also 20 fathom deep.

Now when Royan comes on the west-point whereon the milles stand, keep it so
standing, and go s. e. and by s. to Chastillion: Chastilion
in this reach it is most five fathom deep, but going nearer to the north or
south side it is dryer, and on the north-side it is full of sand, where you may
also sail through if you know it. From Chastilion to Pouliack it is
south-east almost 3 leagues, as aforesaid, and there it is 4, 5, 6, and 7
fathom deep.

Against Pouliack in the middle of the River, there lies an Island, which you
go eastward about straight up to Bley, and there you must go over with the
tide, for at a low water it is but a fathom deep, before Bleye it is 3 or 4
fathom deep again, and you run out by the north-land at 3, 4, and 5
fathom, and when you come before the river which reaches up northwards, then
sail first on upon the middle of the Island, and so along by it, until y^u are
against or past the gallows, which stands upon the east-point of the River,
then along again by the north-side to the four houses, then you must put over
to the high steeple of Dubelot Dubelot.
or Duvecot, and when you are on the south-land by the steeple of Dubelot, then
you must presently cross over again eastward about to the west-point of the
bocht, then go along by the east-land again to Larmond, then you must cross
over again to the houses of Chartroysen, and so along by the south-land to the
town of Bordeaux, before Bordeaux it is 4 or 5 fathom deep, in the crooking
it is 5, 6, and 7 fathom. To conclude in sailing up the River there are many
depths, and it is full of Sands, so that you must often cross over from one
land to the other, as I have said before.

When you will sail out of the River of Bordeaux, then you must stay at Royan
for good wether and a fore-ebbe, and therewith go out, and when you go out,
keep the north-downes northeast and by north from you, so long until that the
steeple of Cordam be east-southeast from you, then you may sail w. n. w.
through the Asses into the Sea.

The North-Esels or Asses may well be sounded at six or seven fathom, that
chanel is wide and broad, and 12 or 13 fathom deep.

III. To sail into the channels of Occason, Bayona, and S. John de Luz.
FRom Cordam to Accason it is south and by north distant 20 leagues, between
them both there lies a tyde-haven called Anchises, Anchises.
which may be entered by a great ship at high water, for it is a deep
tyde-haven.

The coast from the river of Bordeaux or from Cordam to Accason is flat, and
it is there all downie land to S. John de Luz.

Right before the haven of Occason, Accason.
there lie three Islands, which you may sail in by on the north or south side.

The north-chanel North-chanel.
reaches in southeast, there stand two high steeples upon the south-land,
which you must hold two mastes length distant from each other, and sail so
upon them until you are in. Right within the south-point lies a row of
rocks under the water which you must shun, and within about the middle of
the haven there lies a row of blind rocks, but when you keep the steeples
standing so, then you ru^ne through between the rocks at four fathom, and on
the south side you may anckor at four fathom low water.

The south-chanel South-chanel.
runs in between the south-point and the southerlyest Island, and eastward
from the village of Accason there stands a black hillock upon the land, when
that is n. n. e. from you, then go right in upon it, and when you come
between the innermost and the north-point of the haven, there lie many blind
rocks on both sides under the water: but go right upon the black hillock
northeast, and northeast and by north, before the village or small town, and
there anckor at 8, 9, and 10 fathom, in the north-chanel also you have 9 or 10
fathom water, between the north and south-point of the haven it is 5 fathom
deep, and within it is 12 fathom deep.

From Accason to Bayona Bayona.
it is south and north 17 leagues, between them both lies Cabriton, Cabriton.
before which in former time there was wont to be a through-fare for the
ships that would sail into Bayona, through a chanel of 7 leagues long. The
chanel or haven of Bayona runs in between two slight strandes, e. s. e. and
e. and by s. There lies a Baerse before the haven, and upon the land there
stand two trees or mastes keep them one upon another, and so run into the
haven, there is at a high water and a spring stream full three fathom, at
daily tides two fathom and an half, but at low water but three foot water,
when you come about the point, you turn up southward, and anckor before the
town at 5 fathom, within on the north-side it is pyled, to keep the chanel
deep: and it is Pilots water.

From the haven of Bayona to S. John de Luz the course south and by west 4
leagues. S. John de Luz S. John de Luz.
is a tyde-haven, as if it were a peer, you must go in there at high water,
the town lies on the right hand, when it is a spring-tyde the haven is so
dry, that you may go driefoot over it, but it is a baye wherein men lie.

IIII. The situation between S. John de Luz and Cabo de Massichaco.
THree leagues southwest, and s. w. and by w. from S. John de Luz lie the
rocks called the Pingnons of S. Anne, Pingnons of S. Anne.
which lie close by the land. A league westward from them lies the Creek of
Fonteravia, it is a fair baye, where upon the head there stands a castle,
and southward from it a church. Upon the west side of this Baye lies the Cape
de Figuer, Cape Figure.
and upon the point of the Cape lies a rock somewhat distant from it, but the
Sea cannot there pass through between them except it be at a very high
flood, then it breaks a little through: If you will anckor in this Baye of
Fonteravia, Fonteravia.
cast anckor at 8 or 9 fathom, so that the aforesaid rock be n. n. w. from
you, there is it fair sand-ground, where you may lie safe from hurt by a n.w.
wind. Lying in the Baye you have the Pingno^s of S. Anne e.n.e. and Cape de
Figuer n.w. and by w. from you.

A league westward from Cape de Figure lies Passaje, Passaie.
also a fair haven, on the east side of the haven, which is very narrow,
there lies a round rock, so that there it is ylle going in with an ebb, but
with a flood it is better, without it is very fair, there are no shallowes at
all, but only the aforesaid round rock. The town lies right within the haven
on the east side, where men anckor at seven fathom.

Almost three leagues westward from Passage lies S. Sebastian, S. Sebastia^.
between the^ both there is a sand-bay, which lies within a Creek, and there
there goes a dry little river up into the land, there come many barks into
it when it is fair wether.

S. Sebastians haven is good to go into, you go in between two castles,
whereof the easterlyest is the greatest, it stands almost as if it stood upon
an Island, but it stands upon a high hill, the westerlyest stands upon a
small Island or Rock, which is a apiece tower: in sailing in, in the
narrow way between these two castles lies a rock which at low water is 6
fathom deep, and when the storm comes out of the Sea it always ravels
upon it, it lies nearest unto the east-land, and on the west-land it is 10
fathom deep. Now to shun this rock as you enter in, there is a closter east
from the westerlyest Island, and there stands a steeple, which come one over
against the other, which you must run eastward about.

Now to anckor without S. Sebastians in the Rode, you must hold the high hill,
which lies upon the point of Cape de Figure, without the easterlyest Island
aforesaid, and then you may anckor there, but if it fall to be covered under
the Island, the^ you cannot anckor before S. Sebastians in the Rode, but when
you are through the narrow strait within the rock, and past the castles, then
you may anckor on the east side under the great castle, there is the best Rode:
and behind the castle aforesaid there goes up a little water from the
east-castle you may go on foot along upon a high strand upon firm land at
low water, but the strand at high water is covered: it is a Creek, and within
before the town it is deep 5, 6, and 7 fathom, and on the west side under
the small Island you cannot anckor, for there it is flat and dry.

Such as come out of the west and seek to go into S. Sebastians, they must
keep by the land, for it is fair. And a league westward from S. Sebastians
haven lies a Sand-bay, where you may anckor as deep as you will, but they
that from thence will go into S. Sebastians, they must go in in the middle of
the water, between both the Islands, and leave the little Island whereon the
chapel stands on starre-borde, running so toward the first or second wall
of the town, and anckor there, the shalopes or barks will come aborde to you,
and help to get you into the haven between the walls.

From S. Sebastians to Cape de Massichaco the course is w.n. w. 13 leagues,
between them lie these Rodes, to wete, Gaturia and Deva. Gaturia. Deva.


Gaturia lies from S. Sebastian distant w. and by n. and w. n.w. 8 leagues: it
is a round Baye or Creek, where it is safe lying against a south-winde, you
may lie behind the west-point before the town upon fair Sand-ground, a n. w.
wind is there corner-winde. This Baye is commonly called Kings-haven.

Along the coast of Biscaya between S. John de Luz and Gaturia it is al over
fair ground, and good anckoring at 20 fathom.

From Gaturia to Deva it is 2 leagues to the west, it is a falling water which
comes out of the hill.

Three leagues westward lies the out-point of Massichaca. Cape Massicha^a.


Thus the land about the bocht of S. John de Luz shows it self from Cabriton
till you be past S. Sebastians.

The land of Bayona and Cabriton is downie land and ^eacheth south and north.

The land Fonteravia reaches southwest and northeast but by S. Sebastians it
reaches east and west.

V. Of the running of the streams, and what Moon makes a high water here.
IN these places they reckon no falling of streams, for in all the havens
lying upon these coasts a southwest and northeast moon commonly makes a high
water, but within the havens or within the land a point later, that is a
southwest and by west, and a northeast and by east moon.

VI. Of the depths against these places, and at what depths you may see the
land.
Without Heys it is 35 fathom deep, and then you may see the land as you
stand below upon the hatches, when it is clear wether you may see it at 60
fathom.

You may see the land of Olone beneath at 25 and 30 fathom.

S. Martens Island and the north-ende of Oleron may be seen at 28 and 30
fathom. When you have a sight of S. Martens Island, then on it you see a high
steeple and a high house, and on the strand a mill, with four or five high
downs. Upon Oleron you see a high speere steeple upon a red point, whereon
you see some trees standing, and southward it has black downs in three or
four places.

Upon the land on the north-side of the River of Bordeaux, or the steeple of
Cordam you see five or six high white downs, but on the south side thereof
they are low black downs overgrowne with heath, you may see the land against
the River of Bordeaux from the poope of the ship at 30 fathom.

The Coast from Cordam to Accason is a flat coast, which may also be seen at
30 fathom.

Between Accason and S. John de Luz, you may likewise see the land at 30
fathom, and when you are about Bayona, then you see Cabriton, Bayona, Bederte
and S. John de Luz, which for the most part are all flat steeples.

When you come before Passage, you may see the corner of Cape de Figure, and
also S. Sebastians, and there the land lies in a great creek or bowing.

About Cape de Figuer there lies a high hill, which on the southwest end is
very steep, and it is very long, the slopenesse descending toward the
north, when you are close by the land it is very high and steep, but when you
are before S. Sebastians 7 leagues from the land then it is long, and on the
west-ende steeping and hollow.

When you are 8 leagues without S. Sebastians, then you may see the
east-castle, and also the small Island.

VII. How these Countries lie distant from each other.
FRom Heys to S. Martens Island e.s.e. 12 or 13 leagues. From Heys to Porthus or

Here follows the Card N. 7.
CHAPTER VII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Biscaya, between Cabo de
Massichaco and Capo de Pinas.
I. The situation between Cape de Massichaco and Bilbao.
WEst-northwest from S. Sebastian lies Cape de Massichaco Massichaco.
13 leagues, there goes a haven in right west from the Cape, which is a far
tyde-haven, the town lies about a league into the land, upon a River which
comes out of the hill, right west from Cape de Massichaco lies a great rock
fast upon the land, and a little west from it another, which you may well sail
about with barks, and that lies upon the sharp point of Avellanes.

Southwest and by west from Massichaco lies the haven of Barmea, Barmea.
it is a fair great Creek, the east-ende whereof is foul, therefore you must
shun it, and go on the west side, and anckor where you will, it is wide
enough.

West from Barmea lies Placentia Placentia.
upon a little river, the town lies a little into the land, they are all
tyde-havens.

From Cape de Massichaco to Bilbao (between which lies Barmea and Placentia)
it is south-southwest, and southwest and by south 7 leagues.

From Placentia to Bilbao Bilbao.
are almost 3 leagues, west-southwest, and west and by south. Bilbao lies upon
a great river, down from the which there comes much iron: it is a good
haven, but it runs not far in, because of the Banck called la Barse, La
Barse.
which lies cross over the haven, which you must go over at high water.

On the east-point of Bilbao there comes a Sand shooting down, you must
shun that point, for there lie stones and rocks also under the water, and it
is a high steep point, which shows white, yet you anckor before it at seven
or eight fathom, from this point to the haven of Bilbao or the Barse is two
leagues, south and by west, and you must anckor under this point between the
rocks and the Peer, from whence the Pilots come down, there you lie safe
from a northwest wind, but a west-northwest wind is open into it. The chanel
reaches in by the west-land, there stand five or six houses upon the
west-land, when the two westerlyest houses are one against the other, or when
you may see between the two easterlyest houses which stand within the land,
then you are upon the Barse or drougth, go then to the castle of Portogalete
south, and south and by east, close along by the castle, and set right within
the castle against a west-winde: though as you are before the haven then the
Pilots come down and bring you to the town.

When you lie before the Creek, S. Anthonies hill.
then you see Monte Anthoni west and by north from you.

Thus the land east from Bilbao shows when you fall upon it.
view of Bilbao On the west side you see a high sharp hill, and it shows
thus to Castro.
view of 'Castro' (Spain)

II. To sail from Bilbao to S. Andero.
FRom the point of Bilbao to Castro Castro.
the course is west five leagues, it is a good haven, being 6, 7, and 8 fathom
deep, and the length of the haven reaches southwards at 10 fathom, Pascarte

map of the Bay of Biscay you must go in west, and anckor at 6, 7, and 8
fathom, but further in the River to the town it is no deeper then 3 or 4
fathom. There is no safegarde for great ships but with a s.w. wind.

From Bilbao to S. Anthonies Hill it is west and by north 9 or 10 leagues. From
Castro to Laredo the course is west distant six leagues: on the west side
lies the said Hill of S. Anthony, which is a high hill, you may sail close
in by it, or set this Hill south and by east from you, and so also run in
about the east-point of the haven, there it is wide and broad, and a fit haven
for great ships, and there about east you may anckor at 7 or 8 fathom.
Eastward against S. Anthonies Hill in the middle of the way lies a row of
rocks under the water, which you may sail about on both sides, it ravels
always upon them, there within is the Rode for common ships, and that is
right before the haven which is closed with a wall, but great ships lie
somewhat further off, there it is 6 and 7 fathom deep. On the south side of
the haven there is a tyde-haven, from the which there comes a great Sand
shooting off from the east side to S. Anthonies Hill, there within it is two
fathom water, and that is right before the village, but from the village there
comes a point or tail of sand reaching cross out, within it at low water
it is a fathom deep, in the middle of the chanel it is 9 fathom, and at the
point of S. Anthony it is 20 fathom deep.

From S. Anthonies Hill to Cape de Kesgo it is west, and west and by south 3
leagues, C. Kesgo.
it is a great Cape lying east from S. Andero, and there is fair ground.

From Cape de Kesgo to the west-point of S. Andero it is w. and by s. five
leagues, and right southward from the point of S. Andero upon the east-point of
Sardinis is a sandy Baye, where it is good anckoring at 10 fathom.

From Cape de Kesgo to the haven of S. Andero the course is w.s.w. distant 3
leagues. S. Andero S. Andero.
lies in a creek, and there lies an Island before the haven, you may go
about it on both sides, it is 8 and 9 fathom deep, but southward about the
Island it is 5, 6, and 7 fathom deep, after you come near to the strand. The
chanel first reaches w. n. w. the Island lies a great league within the
creek, it is from the east-point of the haven to the west-point of the land
about south and north a great league. S. Anthony and the west-point of S.
Andero lie east and west from each other about 5 leagues. How to know the land
about Laredo.


To know the land when you fall about Laredo, then know that on the west side
of the haven of Laredo S. Anthonies Hill lies, which is a very high hill,
which you see very far both from east and west, and right above the town of
Laredo you see also a sharp hill, as if it were the point of a diamant, or the
point of a two-handed sword, and further about Laredo it is very high double
land, two, three, and at some places four double.

S. Andero has no special or known hills, but when you are before the haven
then eastward you may see the town, and the castle standing upon a high hill,
as if it were a suger-lofe, or a hay-cock, and eastward there is much double
land, two or three height double. But when you are about Cape de Kesgo, then
presently you see the castle upon the west-land.

The land eastward of Laredo being south from you, shows thus with a sharp
hill.
view of Laredo Thus S. Anthonies hill shows it self, lying on the westside
of Laredo.
view of Laredo Thus S. Anthonies hill shows it self, when you are
south-southeast from it.

III. How all the Havens and Rodes between S. Andero and Cape de Pinas should
be sailed.
FRom S. Andero to Cape de Pinas the course is west, or a little northerlyer 37
or 38 leagues, between the which these Havens following do lie.

First the haven of S. Marten S. Marten.
or Settevilles, Settevilles.
lying east and west 4 leagues from S. Andero, it is a tyde-haven.

From thence to S. Vincents, S. Vincent.
also a tyde-haven is 5 leagues, the chanel goes in on the east side, on the
west side there comes a sand shooting off, and in the middle of the chanel
lies an Island, which you may go about on both sides.

From S. Vincents to Lhanes Lhanes.
the course is west three leagues, this is a tyde-haven, upon the west side of
the haven there stands a church, and right within the haven a middle-flatte
or sand, but you must go about on the west side: these are all unknown
narrow havens, he that has occasion may use them.

From Lhanes to Rio de Selia Rio de Selia.
the course is west five or six leagues, he that will go in there must have
regard to a mast which stands upon the east land, you must go in close by
it, for the west side is foul within, and you must anckor within the mast
before the village, it is also a tyde-haven.

From Rio de S^ila westwards nine leagues is Villa Viciosa, V lla Vic^^^a.
this also is a tyde-haven, but fair: the chanel runs in southeast and
southeast and by east, close upon the west-point of the land, for the
east-point is foul to the middle of the haven: there lies a flat right in
the middle of the haven, which at low water is dry, therefore as you go in
you must turn up westward again, on the west side lies the Plecke, you may
sail to it, and anckor upon flat water.

Seven leagues westward from Villa Viciosa lies the outpoint of Sanson,
Sanson.
eastward there lies a little Island whereon there stands a steeple: between
Sanson and the said Island it is good rode at 7 and 8 fathom.

On the west side of Sanson is also good rode, right before the little haven of
Sanson at six and seven fathom.

West from Sanson lies Gyon, Gyon.
having a peer or pyled-head under the which the Fisshermen that dwell there
lay their barks.

A league and an half west from Gyon lies the Creek of Tores, Tores.
a good Rode for a southwest and west wind at 8 and 9 fathom: upon the point
reaching out, stands a high steeple.

Three leagues westward of Tores lies Cape de Pinas, Cape de Pinas.
from whence many rocks lie off to Seaward good half a league at least: it is
said by some that a man may sail through between the point and those rocks.

Thus the land of Biscaya shows it self between Laredo and Rio de Sella, as
you sail along by it.

Laredo. Lhanes. Rio de Sella.

view of Biscay Thus the land shows it self from Rio de Sella to Cape de
Pinas, as you sail along by the same.

IIII. What Moon makes high water upon these Coasts.
AT all places and before all the havens of this coast, a southwest and
northeast moon makes a high water, but within the havens about a point later,
as they reach deeper into the land, as upon the coasts of Britaigne, Poictou
and G^^coigne. Here also they reckon no falling of streams. But the streams
fall cross to and fro.

V. How these Countries are distant one from the other, and from other
Countries also.
HOw these Countries reach and are distant from each other it is already
showed in the description.

From Cape de Massichaca to Accason northeast and somewhat easterlyer 28
leagues. From Cape de Massichaca to Heys north and somewhat e^sterlyer 60
leagues. From S. Andero to the Seims n. n. w. 96 leagues. From Cape de Pinas to
the steeple of Cordam east-northeast, and northeast and by east 72 leagues.
From Cape de Pinas to Porthus or S. Martens Island northeast and somewhat
easterlyer 80 leagues. From Cape de Pinas to Bel-Isle n. n. e. 80 leagues. From
Cape de Pinas to the Seims north 88 leagues. From Cape de Pinas to Cabo de
Veilli in Ireland north and by west and somewhat westerlyer 171 leagues. From
Cape de Pinas to Ortegal w. and by n. 29 leagues.
VI. Under what degrees these Countries lie.
CApe Massichaca lies under 43 degr. 46 or 48 minutes.

Cape de Pinas lies under 43 degrees 54 or 56 minutes.

The whole coast of Biscaya between Cape de Pinas and Cape de Massichaca lies
about 43 degrees and 43, 44, or 45 minutes.

Here follows the Card N. 8.
CHAPTER VIII. A TRVE DESCRIPTION of the Seacoasts of Gallicia, from Cabo de
Pinas to Cabo de Finisterre.
I. To sail from Cape de Pinas to Aviles and Ribadeus.
FRom Cape de Pinas there lies out a row of rocks, which reach half a league
into the sea, they say that a man may sail between those rocks and that
point. But right within or westward from Cape de Pinas lies a great rock,
which you may sail through between it and the land.

When you are within Cape de Pinas, Aviles Aviles.
lies from thence s. s. w. three leagues, it is a good tyde-haven, where a
great ship may well enter at half flood, there is also a good Rode before
this haven at 6 and 7 fathom deep.

To sail into this haven you must go along by the eastside, for the west side
is very flat, there stands a little chapel upon the east side which you
must run in close by, til you be within the two rocks that lie on the
east side of the haven, which you must sail close by, and anckor a little way
within the rocks. The town lies about a league upwards. From the westpoint
there shoots off a sand, which reaches within along the haven to the town,
so that there on both sides it is very shallowe. On the west side of the
haven, without in the bowing thereof there lie two great rocks, right before
the little church, in the sandy Baye, which you may sail round about, but it
is not all to fair, yet without the rocks it is good anckor-ground at 7 and 8
fathom, which is right over against the church, which stands against the
high land.

From Aviles to Luarca Luarca.
it is 7 leagues, and from Luarca to Ribadeus Ribadeus.
the course is w. s. w. seven leagues. Or from Aviles to Ribadeus s. w. and by
w. 13 leagues.

To sail into the haven of Ribadeus you must go close in by the west-land, on
the west side of the haven there stands a high flat steeple, as if it were
upon the Corongne, you must sail in along by the said steeple at two cables
length, (for at the east-point there lies a rock under the water) the^ you
must sail forward in the middle of the water, the haven for the most part
reaches in south, and south and by east, you may anckor on the east side
before Castrapol, Castrapol.
or on the west side before Ribadeus, where you will at five or six fathom.
Within it is all flat water, if you lie far out or deep within as 4, 5, 6,
and 7 fathom.

Thus the land of Aviles shows it self when you are before Aviles.
view of Aviles

II. To sail from Ribadeus to Viverus, and then to Ortegal.
NOrthwest from Ribadeus about eight leagues lies the Cape de Brilo, Cape de
Brilo.
and a little west from thence lies the little town of Viverus. Viverus.
Westward from the baye of Cyprian (where you may anckor at ten fathom)
there lie two great high rocks, west-northwest from those rocks about half a
league lies the Island of S. Cyprian, Island S. Cyprian.
which lies right before the haven of Viverus, whereby this haven of Viverus
is well to be known, you may sail round about on both sides of this Island
into the haven of Viverus, in the middle of the water south and south and by
west, right before the town, and being within you may anckor where you will,
either on the east or west side, it is there flat water of 5, 6, 7, and 8
fathom, as you run far inward.

From the haven of Viverus or from the Island of S. Cyprian Pascaarte vande

map of Galicia to Cape de Ortegal Cape de Ortegal.
the course is w.n. w. 9 leagues: between both, a league westward from
Viverus, lies the little town of S. Mark S. Marck.
with a creek, which you may ride before at 7 or 8 fathom, and lie safe
against a s. s. w. and w. wind.

And three leagues westward from S. Marks lies the River of Karins, Karins.
and there also it is good anckoring along to the castle of Ortegal, all the
coast along is fair. From Karins to Ortegal the course is northwest 5 leagues.

Ortegal is a great point of land lying out, eastward from it you may lie safe
from a northwest, west, southwest, and south wind, against the castle is the
best Rode, where you may anckor at 8 and 9 fathom. When you come from the
east, Ortegal is well to be known, you may see the castle stand against the
high land.

Thus Ortegal shows when it is s.w. and by s. from you.
view of Ortegal Thus Ortegal shows when the easterlyest hill lies
south-southeast from you, and you may see the east-ende clearly eight, nine, or
ten leagues into the Sea.
view of Ortegal Thus Ortegal shows it self as it is s.e. and by s. from you.

When Ortegal is southeast from you it opens thus.

view of Ortegal

III. To sail from Cape de Ortegal to Ferol de Corongne, and to the Island of
Cyzarga.
ABout a league into the Sea north-northwest from Ortegal lies a row of great
rocks, you may sail between them and the firm land at 10 fathom, Ortegal
and Cape de Prior are distant northeast and southwest 11 leagues..

Between Ortegal and Cape Prior lies the haven of Siguera Siguera.
or Siverus, which is a deep haven, reaching in southeast, the north-side is
rockie and foul, you must go in close by the westland, sailing along by a
high land at 12 fathom, within it is 10 fathom, and you must anckor before
the village of Siguera at 6 or 7 fathom.

Five leagues westward from Siguera lies Cape de Prior, Cape de. Prior.
which is a very craggie uneven hill, which to see to is like as if it sat
full of men.

Three leagues from Cape de Prior southward lies the haven of Ferol, sailing
to it you come first to two white Sandbayes, How to sail into Ferol.
which lie northward from the said haven, whereof the southerlyest is the
greatest, whereon also one or two white houses stand, southward from that lies
the north-point of the haven of Ferol, and when you go by it then the haven
opens it self, which you must run into through the middle of the chanel e.
n. e. and e. and by n. between two high lands, and when you are within, you
must turn up northward, and anckor at 12 and 13 fathom, for before the
village of Ferol it is rockie and flat. The south-point of Ferol reaches
far out, and is all foul, when you are in the middle of the narrow or
strait, then you may see through between the firme-land and the Island of
Cyzarga, in the narrow it is 20 fathom deep, and so narrow that you may
cast a stone upon the land on both sides thereof.

But when you come from Corongne from the west, and will put into Ferol, then
from the Island of S. Blase go n. and n. and by w. until you may see the haven
of Ferol open, and sail still till it closes again, then you shall see the
great Sand-baye with two or three houses, sail to it until you are within the
south-point of the haven, for (as I said before) it is foul and rockie, and
then sail upon the north-point of the haven, the^ you sail the haven open
again, and so go through the middle of the chanel, and anckor therein as is
taught you before.

To sail from Ferol to Corongne the course is south, How to sail into Corongne
and south and by west about four little leagues, but when you come to the
west-land you must shun it at least four or five cables length, for it is not
very fair: when you come to the point whereon the castle stands, then you
see a little Island with a small house upon it, you may sail by it within half a
cables length, and go about by it, and then go up westward till you come
before the Fisshermens village, and there anckor at 6, 7 or 8 fathom water.

From C. de Prior to Corongne the course is south and north 6 leagues: to sail
from thence to the Carongne you must also do as I said before.

You may sail into the haven or entry of the Carongne 5 or 6 leagues right
southeast in, coming from Farol or Cysarga, passing by the Coruna or Corongne
to Fontaine Fontaine.
or Pitance, Pitance.
where on the west side under a row of rocks, you may anckor at 10 or 12
fathom, and you may run so far inwards that you may see no Sea.

Right against la Corongne e. n. e. lies another haven called Pont de Mas,
Pont de Mas.
which teaches in eastward, wherein also you may run so far that you can
see no Sea, there also you may anckor at 10 or 12 fathom. There lies a row
of rocks on the north-side, and over the river there goes a great bridge.

He that comes out of the west from Cysarga must go in e. s. e. until he be
a little within the steeple which stands on the west-point of the Corongne,
for on the west side it is altogether foul, so long till it begins to come
right against the castle, and then doing as I said before.

West-northwest from the Corongne 8 leagues lies the Island of Cyzarga, Cysarga.
and from Cape Prior it is w.s.w 8 leagues.

But from Cape Ortegal it is southwest and by west 17 leagues, this Island of
Cysarga (which by us is called Cesarien) is round about foul.

Thus Cape Prior shows it self being the east-point of Corongne.
view of 'Corongne' (city in Spain) The Land lying east from Corongne shows
thus when it is southeast from you.
view of 'Corongne' (city in Spain)

IIII. To sail from the Island of Cysarga to Cape de Finisterre.
FRom the Island Cysarga south and by west, and s. s. w. lies the haven of
Queres, Queres.
which is a good haven, the west side is fair, but the east side is foul,
therefore you must go in along by the west side, and when you are between the
two lands, then run in through the middle of the chanel, to the point, then
turn up westward a league inwards, and there anckor at 7, 8, and 9 fathom, it
is a fair haven for great ships.

From the Island of Cysarga southwest and by west, and westsouthwest 12 or 13
leagues lies the east-point of Monsy, Cape de Bylem.
called Cabo de Bilem, it is a high slopeing point with many craggie rocks,
lying loose off from the land, as if it were a steeple, it shows black, and
is called the Monck. Monck.


There lies a great row of rocks right before the haven of Monsy, Rocks
before Monsy.
s.w. and by s. from Monck, but the innermost end of them lies south and by
west from the Monck, for they are at least two or three cables in length, when
you fall upon Monsy it is double land, and about Cape de Finisterre lies a
high white sand reaching into the land, as if it were a sand-baye.

And as you come about Cape de Finisterre you see also a craggie hill, which
runs in so far southwards that you may see it before Mores.

If you will enter into Monsy coming from Cysarga, To sail into Morsy.
you must go in close by Cape de Bylem or Bellem, this point is altogether a
high craggie sharp land full of high steep rocks, as I said before, and when
you are by the point, you must hold Cape de Coriane a ships length without
Cape de Cotte so long until S. Mary's church comes without the point of
Monsy, then go into the east-chanel East-chanel.
with these marks, and sail in s. s. e. till you pass by the church, then
you shall see a row of rocks, run in behind them, and anckor there before
the village of Monsy at 5, 6, or 7 fathom: as you sail thus from Cape Bylem
to Monsy, the^ the rocks that lie in the middle before the haven are about a
quarter of a league inward to the Sea from you.

To sail in at the west-chanel, West-chanel.
you must go east-southeast easily along by the land, and when our Ladies
church comes without the point, then you must go toward the rocks which lie
before Monsy, as aforesaid, and anckor within the rocks at seven or eight
fathom, but go not too far in, for there shoots out a sand along the
haven which is very dry.

The east-chanel is better to enter then the west chanel, but sail not into
Monsy before you see the church without the point: you may also anckor well on
the north-side of the haven at 5, 6 or 7 fathom.

South from the village of Monsy there is a creek, before the which there
lies a shallowe reaching e.n.e. two cables length along by the haven.

Our Ladies church and the Monk lie distant from each other n. and by e. and
s. and by w.

Southwest from C. de Bylem 3 leagues lies Cap de Coriane. C. de Coriane.


And from Cape de Coriane it is south and north three leagues to Cape de
Finisterre. Between these two Capes there is a Sand-baye, where you may anckor
eastward from the great rock at 6 or 7 fathom. This is a great creek, which
reaches far into the land. On the north-side of this Baye there lie rocks
under the water which you must shun.

There lies a great Sand-baye east from the Cape de Finisterre, when you see
it you may know, that you are by Cape de Finisterre, there lies also another
between the haven of Corcobayona and the Cape, but the first is the greatest,
but by this second the haven of Corcobayona or Seche goes in, which for the
most part reaches in north, as in the Chapter enseweing it is showed.

Thus the land of Monsy shows it self between Cape de Finisterre and
Cysarga, as you sail along by it coming out of the east, about four leagues
from the land.
view of 'Monsy' (Spain) When Cape de Finisterre is south-southeast from you it
shows thus.
view of Cape Finisterre Cape de Finisterre being southeast and somewhat
southerlyer from you shows thus.
view of Cape Finisterre Thus Cape de Finisterre shows it self when it is
southeast and somewhat easterlyer from you.
view of Cape Finisterre When Cape Finisterre is southeast and by east from you
five or six leagues it shows thus.

V. What Moon makes high water here.
Upon all these Coasts of Gallicia a southwest and a northeast moon makes a
high water, and within the channels and havens a southwest and by west, and a
northeast and by east moon, or a point later, as the havens reach deep or
far into the Land, as upon the coasts of Biscaya and France.

VI. How these Countries lie from others.

it is northeast and by north from you.
view of Cape Finisterre When Cabo de Finisterre is about north-northeast, and
the land of Mores seven leagues northeast from you, then the Cape lies thus
broken in three pieces, and the land of Mores thus.
view of Cape Finisterre

I. The situation of Cabo de Finisterre, Mores, Rio Roxo, or Villa Nova.
Between Cape de Coriana and Cape de Finisterre (as I said in the chapter
before) there goes in a great Creek, which reaches far into the land,
where you may anckor eastward of the great rock, before a Sandbaye at 6 or 7
fathom.

About a league eastward from Cape de Finisterre on the south side lies the
haven of Seche Seche.
or Corcovia, which the Hollanders call Corcke Bayone: Corcke Bayone.
between this haven and the Cape there lie two Sand-bayes, the first nearest
to the Cape is the greatest, and by the second goes this haven in, and
reaches in north at 8 or 9 fathom. On the east side of the haven lies a
great rock, and about south-southwest from this rock, (almost in the middle of
the haven) there lies a blind rock under the water, but run northward
until you see the town on the west side, and there anckor at 6 or 7 or 8
fathom, within the river there lies a village or little town about north
northeast from you.

From Cape de Finisterre to the haven of Mores Mores.
the course is southeast six leagues. To know the land there aboutes you must
understand that when you are about Cape de Finisterre, you see a craggie ragged
hill, which runs so far southwards that you may see it before Mores.

When the said craggie Rock is northeast from you, then you are against C.
Finisterre, and then Monte Lauro, Monte Lauro.
a hill lying upon the northeast-point of Mores, lies east-northeast from you.
This hill called Monte Lauro is a cloven high hill, which is easy to know.

When the craggie hill between Cape Finisterre and Mores lies east-northeast
seven leagues from you, it shows thus.
view of Cape Finisterre

Southeast three leagues from Cape de Finisterre there lie a company of rocks
under the water, and east-southeast also about 3 leagues from the aforesaid
rocks there lie some rocks above the water, and they lie northward from Monte
Lauro, or the haven of Mores east and by north and west and by south distant
from Monte Lauro. There lie also a number of rocks southward from the haven of
Mores, and almost in the middewaie from Monte Lauro, right in the middle of the
Voert there is a blind rock also about southwest from Monte Lauro.

He that will sail into Mores must set Monte Lauro northeast and by north
from him, To sail into Mores.
and sail right upon Monte Lauro, then he shall sail by no dangers, when he
comes to Monte Lauro, then he shall see the aforesaid outrockes northward
from Monte Lauro, let them, as also the point of Monte Lauro lie two or three
cables length on baghborde, and sail so along by them, till you be past the
second point, leaving the blinde-rock which lies in the middle of the way on
starreborde, and when the Fisshers village which stands northward from Monte
Lauro is whole open to be seen, the^ you are within the aforesaid blinde-rock
lying in the middle of the way, south and by east, and somewhat easterlyer
from the east-ende of the aforesaid Fisshermens village.

When you come to the second point, then go a cables length along about by it,
and turn up northward, till you come before the village, or westward up before
the town, whether you will, and there anckor at 12 and 13 fathom.

To sail into Rio Roxo, To sail into Rio Roxo.
then ru^ne about without the rocks which lie southward from Mores, and go on
southeast and by south, till you come before the haven of Rio Roxo, then you
shall see a great number of out-rockes reaching out from the north-land almost
to a great rock like an Island, which is called Salure: you may go north about
this Island, and so between it and these out-rockes, but it is very narrow
and strait, because of the rocks aforesaid, which come off from the
north-land, therefore sail southward along forward about that Island, leaving
it on baghborde, or to seaward from you, until you see the River open, then
run in through the middle of the chanel, until you see the Island of Roxo in
the middle thereof, and sail up unto it, and when you come to it, then you may
anckor on the south side. On the south-land there are two Sandie-bayes, where
there is good anckor-ground.

When Cape de Finisterre is northeast, or north-northeast, and Monte Lauro five
leagues east-northeast from you, it shows it self with the high land of Mores
thus.

II. To sail into Ponte Vedro and Bayona.
FRom Rio Roxo or the Island of Salure to Ponte Vedra, or the Island Blidones
Blydones.
the course is s. s. e. four leagues, between them both there lies an Island,
called Monte Carbela, Monte Carbela.
behind it it is three fathom deep, but right before the haven of Ponte
Vedro there lies an Island called Blidones, which may be sailed round about, on
the north-side it is no deeper then five or six fathom, and within the haven
on the north-side there lie two rocks called the Boos or Oxen, on the
south side of Blidones it is the right chanel to sail into Ponte Vedro, the
chanel reaches in northeast, till you be within the Island, in the middle of
the haven there lies an other Island, which you must also go southward about,
therefore go all e. n. e. and along by the south-land, until you see the flat
steeple which stands upon the south-land, there you must run over a banck
forward to the point of Ponte Vedro, there within lies the town, and against
the flat steeple you may anckor at 8 and 9 fathom. This haven in some places
is 40 fathom deep.

Five leagues southward from the Island of Blidones, lie the Islands of Bayona,
Islands of Bayona.
when you come out of the Sea upon them, then those Islands shine like graye or
black rocks, and lie as if they were three Islands, although the water runs
between them but in one place, but between each of them there is a valley.

To landward over these Islands you may see a high hill with three hillockes,
and between each hillock there is a valley.

There lie two such hills, the northerlyest has one valley more then the
other, right east from this hill you may see a white closter stand against the
high land, whereby this land is well to be known.

You may sail in there both by north and by south of the Islands of Bayona, and
on the north-point of the Islands there lies a rock under the water, about a
cables length from it which you must beware of. You may also anckor under the
Islands at 10, 11, or 12 fathom.

He that will sail northward in, North chanel.
he must run in about the middle of the chanel, between the Islands and the
firm land, but nearest to the Islands, till the havens of Vigo and Cannas lie
open, then you must sail in eastward, it is a wide haven, where on both sides,
that is on the south side before Vigo, and the north-side before Cannas you may
anckor at twelve or thirteen fathom.

You may also sail inwards about the south-point of Rondella, where you may
lay the ship safe in the mudde without anckor or cable.

But he that will go in southward about the Islands to Vigo or Cannas, South
chanel.
he must sail in between the southerlyest Island and the point of the land of
Bayona, along in the middle of the chanel northeast, and northeast and by north
3 leagues at the least, keeping the north-haven two ships length open, so
long until that Cannas Cannas
comes on the north-land without the point of Fignes or Vigo, Vigo
then he must let the point of Vigo lie on starborde from him, and go in in
the middle of the chanel, between the north-land and the land of Fignes, till
he be before the town of Vigo, and there he must anckor, as aforesaid, before
Cannas or Vigo where he will at 10 or 12 fathom.

But he that will sail into Bayona, Bayona.
he must sail on from the southerlyest end of the castle of Bayona, and when
he comes within the point of Bayona, he must not sail far into the bocht,
for there lies a rock under the water, but then sail to the east-point of
Bayona whereon the castle stands, and being within the castle, then turn or
run quickly southward till you be before the town, and anckor at 4, 5, and 6
fathom, but right before the town there lies a blind rock, which you must
shun.

You may also, lying between the point on the other side of the aforesaid
haven and the Island or Rock, sail through a^ three or four fathom to Vigo.

To know the land of Bayona.
To know the Land such as come from the south, must understand that north from
the hill of S. Rego half way to Bayona, there stands a closter upon the side
or corner of the land, which is a good mark for Bayona to those that come out
of the south. This hill of S. Rego aforesaid, lies right northward from
Camina, and if is a high steep hill, which above upon the middle thereof has
a clift or saddle as you behold it, it is almost like to Monte Lauro, but it
is at least once as high again, and it is a very good mark to know this
Country. Behind Bayona also there lies a high hill with three clifts in it,
whereof I have spoken before, when this Hill is east-southeast from you, then
you are right against the Islands of Bayona, you may then sail to the said
Islands if you will go into Bayona, and then you cannot do amiss.

When the point of Bayona is eastnortheast, and the high land east from you,
then it shows thus, and then southward lies the high hill of S. Rego.

Bayona. Closter. S. Rego.

view of Bayona When the high hill of S. Rego is east from you, then the high
land of Bayona shows thus, as it is here set down, and the Closter stands
about half way between S. Rego and Bayona.

Bayona. Closter.

view of Bayona

III. To sail into Camina and Viana.
FIve leagues southward from the Islands of Bayona lies the haven of Camina,
Camina.
it is a tyde-haven, which great ships must enter into at a high water, the
chanel reaches in northeast and by north, within the haven there lies a rock
nearest to the south side, upon it there stands a house, and close southward
from this little Island is the deepest water to sail out and into the haven.
Within the haven on the north-side there lies a little Island, whereon there
stands a steeple, which you must keep over against the steeple which
stands upon the north-land, and so go in upon it, in the chanel it is two
fathom deep at half flood.

From the west side of the haven there comes a banck of stony sand shooting
off, and there it is for the most part flat water, and very rockie, therefore
men must be careful thereof.

Seven leagues southward from Camina lies the Tyde-haven of Viana, Viana.
he that will go into it must understand, that from the north-side of the
River there comes a stony banck of sand shooting down, cross over before
the River, there (when you come out of the Sea) you must go so long southward
about, until that the two fire-towres are one against the other, and then
run to the strand, so long until that the tower standing upon the north-side
be over against the two houses, keep it standing so, and run to the rock
with the mast, and sail eastward about from it and close along, you shall find
two fa^^^me water upon that Sand (with a continual daily tide) at low water:
when you are past that Rock, then you shall see another Rock with a mast or
beakon standing thereon, lying on the north side of the land within the river,
ru^ne there likewise about close along southward, and then easily along by the
north-land, until you come before the town, there sometimes there shoots
out a Sand, which you must shu^ne, and anckor before the town. When you lie
before the town, then there lies a little Island southward from you, whereon
there stands a little chapel, westward from this Island lies a great banck;
which at low water is seen above it, but there behind the banck it is five
and six fathom deep, and before Viana it is seven, eight and nine fathom
deep. When you go in you may run southward, about the aforesaid banck, and
come by the Island whereon the house stands out again, before the town.

Rode before Viana.
You may also anckor well without in the Rode at twelve fathom, there is the
farest ground, there take in a Pilot, because it is a very narrow chanel to
enter into.

Or you may sail well in with these marks: there stand two marks upon the
southside, which (when you come out of the Sea) you must hold one against the
other, and sail so long to the land, until the two marks standing on the
north-side of the River are likewise one against the other, and so sail in by
the south side, eastward about the rock whereon the mast or stenge stands,
until you see the River open, then sail in eastward, southward of the second
rock with the steng that stands up, and when you are a bow shot within the
said rock, then straight let your anckor fall, and carry cables to the south
land and make your ship fast with four ropes.

IIII. The situation between Viana and Port a port.
FRom Viana to Port a port the course is south and by east twelve or therteene
leagues. Between them both lies Villa del Conde, Villa del Conde.
seven leagues from Viana and Metelin. Villa del Conde is a Tyde-haven, before
the mouth thereof there lie many rocks, which may be sailed about either south
or north, about them it is 5 or 6 fathom, and inwards again there lies a
banck cross over the haven, which is two fathom deep with high water, within
the haven it is 3 or 4 fathom deep, and southwards up it is deepest and
safest, for on the north-side it is full of rocks, which for the most part lie
under the water, so that it is best lying on the south side at 5 or 6 fathom.

Four leagues southward from Villa del Conde, lie the great out-rockes called
Lesons, Lesons.
right before a tyde-haven, of two fathom deep called Metelin, Metelin.
and southwest from the south-point of the said Lesons, about half a league
inward to the Sea, there lies a blind rock under the water: between the land
and the Lesons rocks it is six or seven fathom deep.

About a league south from Lesons rocks lies Port a port Port a port.
which has two channels, the one runs in n. the other south.

The south chanel South-chanel.
(which runs in southward, and now the best) runs along by the
south-land, and is 3 fathom deep, to the rock with the cross, close in along
by it, and keep in the middle of the chanel, till you come by a great steeple,
upon the north-la^d, which you may see through, and there anckor. This chanel
alters sometimes, and therefore you must be careful thereof.

You must run into the north-chanel North-chanel.
in this manner, you must sail along by the north-point, where now with half
flood it is three fathom water, it reaches in e. s. e. and e. and by s. there
reach many rocks cross over the haven from the said north-point, but you
run along by them, leaving two-partes of the water on the north-side, then
you run upon the southland, and along by it till you come to the rock with
the cross, and then in the middle of the chanel, till you come before the
town, where you have 10 or 12 fathom deep.

V. To sail into Avero with the situation of Cape de Montego and the Barles.
FIrst to sail from Port a port to Avero Avero.
the course is s. and by n. 10 leagues. To know the land, you must understand,
that from Port a port to Avero it is altogether sandy strand, and you may go
along by the strand at 10 or 12 fathom.

Inward to the land, upon the high land there lies a black hillock upon the
land, when that lies e.s.e. from you, then you are open before Avero, and when
you can not see the black hillock of Carmale, there lies a row of downs
northward from the haven, then you are half a league from the haven.

To sail into the haven of Avero, To sail into Avro.
you must understand that when you come upon the land at 6 or 7 fathom, then
you may see three beakons made of mastes of ships upon the south-land, place
them one right against the other, and so ru^ne in e. and by s. and e.s.e. over
the banck, (at the entry of the chanel you have but 2 fathom water at half
flood) till you come by the beakons, then turn a^aine northwest and
northnorthwest, till you be close by the north-land, then run close by it,
and so you leave all the shallowes on your right hand, until you see the River
open, then you see a house upon the strand on the west side, then go from
thence up into the River east and by south, and eastsoutheast in the middle of
the chanel between both lands, till you be before the Salt-pannes or Avero,
where you may lade your ship full of salt, when you go upon the mastes or
beakons out of the Sea, then you see a dry Sand, by the which you must quickly
wind about, and sail in by the west-land, as I said before. This chanel is
two fathom deep, with daily tides, but within you have 4 or 5 fathom deep.

From Avero to Cape de Montego Cape de Montego.
it is south-southwest 7 leagues.

A league southward from Cape de Montego lies Pissago, Pissago.
a Tyde-haven, in it you find two fathom water (with a continual tide) at
half flood.

Half a league westward into the Sea from this haven lies a banck of six
fathom deep, which you may anckor under at 12 or 13 fathom, it is at least a
great league long, and it is best to come in about under this banck.

Coming off from Cape de Montego you may also anckor under this banck at 7
fathom.

From Cape de Montego to Pineche, Pineche.
or Nova Lisbona the course is s.w. and by s. 11 leagues. From Cape de Montego
to the Barlis it is s.w. 12 or 13 leagues.

The point behind the Barlis or Barlinges, is also called Cape del Fisiron,
there lies a rock off from the point, and there southward there is a great
creek, where the castle or town lies, there you may run behind with
barks, and lie safe, the town is called Atogie, it lies against the high
hills.

VI. To know the places of this Coast.
THe Coast of Portugal about Viana is well to be known, by means of the
aforesaid hill of Rego, because it is so extreme high, and lies upon the
water side, and the high land of Viana lies twice or thrice double behind it.
Between Viana, Villa del Conde, and Port a port, you may see many steeples,
and houses upon the Land, and you see Villa del Conde lie as if it were a great
town. You may know the River of Port a port by the rocks called Lesons which
are very high, and lie right north from the River. But about Avero it is
altogether sandy strand, and inward to the land there lies a black hillock
within the land.

Cape Montego is a high point, and there against it in the land it is high
hills. This Cape is sometimes taken for Roxant, but that is well to be known
from the other, because of the Barlis which lies between both.

Thus the coast of Portugal shows it self from Bayona to Cape de Montego,
when you sail about four leagues from it.

S. Rego.

view of the coast of Portugal That which stands heereunder belongs to that
that stands above where the crosses stand.

Cap de Montego.

view of Cabo Mondego

When that black hillock whereby the hand is, stands e. s. e. from you, then
you are right against, or before the River of Avero.

VII. What Moon makes high water here.
Upon all these coasts of Portugal a northeast and southwest moon makes a
high water, but within the havens a point later, as I have said before, you
need not reckon any falling of streams here, for the flood there goes
cross toward the land and off again.

VIII. How these Countries lie one from the other.
FRom Cape de Finisterre to Mores or Monte Lauro the course is southeast 5
leagues. From Rio Roxo to Ponte Vedra s. s. e. 5 leagues. From Ponte Vedra or
Blidones to the Islands of Bayone south-southeast 5 leagues. From Bayona to
Camina south and by east 4 leagues. From Camina to Viana southsoutheast 7
leagues. From Viana to Villa de Conde south and by east 7 leagues. From Villa
de Conde to Port a port s. and by e. 5 leagues. From Port a port to Avero south
11 leagues. From Avero to Cap Montego southsouthwest 7 leagues. From Cape de
Montego to Pineche or Cape de Fisiron southwest and by south 11 leagues. From
Cape de Finisterre to the Islands of Bayona southeast and by south 19 leagues.
From Cape de Finisterre to Port a port s. s. e. 44 leagues. From C. de
Finisterre to Avero s. and by e. and s.s.e. 54 leagues. From Cape de Finisterre
to Barrels south 67 leagues. From Bayona to Barrels 49 leagues. From Port a
port to Barrels s. s. w. and s.w. and by s. 29 leagues. From Avero to Barrels
southwest 20 leagues.
IX. How these Countries lie from other Countries.
FRom Cape de Finisterre to great Canaria southsouthwest and somewhat
southerlyer 307 leagues. From Cape Finisterre to the Salvages s.s.w. 273
leagues. From Cape de Finisterre to the I Will of Madera southwest and by south
and somewhat southerlyer 246 leagues. From Cape de Finisterre to the I Will of S.

de Finisterre to the Seims n. e. and by n. and somewhat northerlyer 112
leagues. From Cape de Finisterre to Belisle southwest 122 leagues.
X. Under what degrees these Countries lie.
CApe de Finisterre lies under 43 degrees. Bayona lies under 42 degrees 10
minutes, or as some say 42 degrees.
Port a port lies under 41 degrees. Avero lies under 40 degrees 26 minutes.
Cape de Montego lies under 40 degrees 8 minutes. The Barlinges lie under 39
degrees 40 minutes.
The other places lying on these coasts you may take the height thereof in the
Card with the compasses.

Here follows the Card N. 10.
CHAPTER X. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Portugal and Algarve, which
lie between the Barlinges and Cabo de S. Vincent.
I. How you shall sail the River of Lisbon.
FRom Barlinges to Roxent the course is south and by east, and southsoutheast,
distant 16 leagues. Behind the Barlinges or Barlis there is a good Rode and
anckor ground, Rode behind the Barils.
against the Hermites house, where you may anckor at 10 fathom, under the
great Island, as it stands marked in the Card, you may go south and north on
both sides thereof, behind them as you will, for there it is fair.

Behind the Barlis lies Cape de Fisiron, and right south from thence lies a
high round hill, which our sailors name Young Rocxent. Young Rocxent.
From Cape de Fisiron to Rocxent it is south and north 15 or 16 leagues.
Rocxent is a point of land well to be known, for although you are a great way
from it, yet you may see the sharp hillock of Syntra closter.

When Roxent is east and by south and eastsoutheast from you seven leagues then
it shows thus.
view of 'Roxent' (a hill in Portugal) Thus Rocxent shows being northeast
from you 7 leagues.
view of 'Roxent' (a hill in Portugal)

A league east from the point of Roxent lies the Rode of Cas^alis, where you
may lie safe from a northwest, north, and northeast wind, at 12 or 13 fathom,
as dry as you will. A great league east from Cascalis lies the point of S.
Julian or S. Giles, S. Giles.
thereon stands a strong castle, and that is the north-point of the River of
Lisbon, and the north-chanel North-chanel.
of the said River goes up the length of a bullets cast in by it.

To sail in by this point, you must sail within a mastes length of the
castle, and keep the north-land to Restiers, and so to Lisbon, commonly you
anckor before the village of Bolin, at 12 and 13 fathom, but you must take
heed that you enter not into the haven with still water, and with an ebb, for
it falls very strong upon the north Shops or Sops. The chanel of S. Giles
reaches in e. and by s. and when you are within you must sail e.n.e. and n.e.
and by e. and when you come against the closter at Restiers, then you must make
somewhat toward the south-land, otherwise you must hold all along the
north-land, as aforesaid.

To sail into the Crake-chanel, To sail into the Crake-chanel.
then you must place Cascalis over the point of Roxent, until the steeple
(which you may see standing above the closter at Restiers) comes over against
the white closter which stands furthest from Restiers, that is, over against
S. Katherines closter, then go in n. e. and n. e. and by n. keeping these
marks standing thus, until you come within S. Giles point, and so go in along
by the north-land of Restiers, till you be within the castle, and then anckor
where you will: with these marks you may sail into and out of the Crake
chanel. Or if you come from the west, and will go into Crake-chanel, then
place Cascalis over against the west-ende of Roxent, and so sail about the
North-capes, until the town of Lisbon be within two ships length of the
south side of the River, and sail in so, n. e. and n.e. and by n. when you see
the Sandbaye within S. Giles point, then you are in a good way.

But if it should fall out that you may not see the town nor Pascaarte vande

map of the coast of Portugal the castle, then keep the Sandbay (which lies
within S. Giles) n.e. and by n. from you, and so sail in n.e. and n.e. and by
n. and hold the course of the North-Sops at 8 or 9 fathom, and when you begin
to come against S. Giles point, then sail softly along by the north-land, as I
have said.

To laveere in the Krake chanel.
He that will laveere out of and into the Crake-chanel must leave the steeple
aforesaid (standing in the land) a ships length southward, and a ships length
northward from S. Katherines closter aforesaid, and then turn every boute,
and so laveere out and in. And go not out of or into this chanel with a calm
or an ebb, for it falls very stif over the east-ende of the Cachops.

If you will go out of the Crake-chanel, take good heed to the steeple, when
it comes under the high-land, then set it right west from the second white
closter, and go on s.w. and by s. then the steeple will come upon the closter.

But if you must laveere out then look well to your tide, for the stream
falls very stif over the Cachops, (...) that with a calm it is dangerous to
go out and into this chanel, but specially in sailing out with an ebb, for
that falls cross over the Cachops, therefore look well to it in calm wether.

II. To sail to S. Was or Setubal, and so to C. S. Vincent.
S. Was point. C. Spichel.
FRom Roxent to S. Uves point the course is s.e. and by s. 11 leagues. It is a
point well to be known, because there lies a high round hill thereon, also you
see the upper part of the castle of Sizember, upon a flat hill, as if it were
a great gavel end of a countrie-house.

Thus S. Was point shows when it is east and by north from you 7 leagues.
view of Cape Espichel

S. Uves point is called Cape de Spichel, right south about the point there is
a rent or cloven place in the land, there against it is good rideing at 9 and
10 fathom, and before Sisember you may also anckor at 15 or 16 fathom.

Five leagues eastward from Cape de Spichel, or S. Uves point lies S. Uves,
where there lies a great banck before the haven, there stands a white castle
beneath the high land upon the water, when it is n.n.e. from you, then you are
right before the chanel or haven.

He that will sail to S. Uves over the banck coming down from S. Uves point
he must keep the west-point of Sisember a ships length without the east-point,
To sail into S. Was.
and so go forward e. and e. and by n. until the castle of Palmelo, which
stands above S. Uves comes in a valley over the white castle which stands
upon the water side, then sail in right n.n.e. til you be within the castle
which stands upon the water, and then within a cables length in by the
north-land n.e. and by e. till you are before the town of S. Uves or Setubal.
But when the castle of Palmelo comes under the land, so that you can see it
no more, then there stands a white house on the north-side of the castle that
stands upon the water side, keep that standing so, and run in upon it,
till you be within the white castle, and then go along by the north-land, as I
said before, till you be before the town of Uves, and anckor before the
Fishermens village at 6 or 7 fathom. Upon the banck it is 3 fathom and a half
water at half flood, and when you sail over it you find seven shallowe or
dry places, By the south-land also there goes in a chanel, but that is only
for barks, between this chanel and the right depth, the banckes in some places
lie so dry, that they lie almost above the water.

Now to go over the deepest water in the banck of S. Uves as you sail out,
with ships that draw much water, when you set sail from the white castle,
then set the white house over against the north-side of the castle, so that you
may see through them, and hold it so, until S. Uves point begins to come
without the east-point of Sisember, then bring the white house on the
south side of the castle which stands upon the water side, and so run out,
for there you shall have the deepest water, but when you may see the castle of
Palmelo, that is a right long mark to run over the banck. Then the white
castle must be n.n.e. and somewhat northerlyer from you.

From S. Uves point to C.S. Vincent C. S. Vincent.
it is s. and s. and by e. 29 leag. between them there is no known havens. But
eastward about from Cape S. Vincent you may anckor before a sand-bay at 20
fathom, against a n. and n.n.w. wind.

But to know the land, you must understand that between C. S. Vincent and S.
Uves point there lie some high hills, called Salines, and half a league n.
from Cape S. Vincent, there lies a high whitish cliffe in the land, which is
higher then the other land, when you see it then you are by the Cape, and upon
the point of S. Vincent there stands a broken closter, and close by the Cape
there lies a high rock. The whole coast of Algarve may be known by the
Fgge-hilles, Fig-hilles
as also Cape S. Vincent.

Thus the land about Cape S. Vincent shows it self when you come from the
north, and sail along by it.

Blewe-hill. Salines. Figge-hill C. S. Vincent

view of Cape Saint Vincent

III. What Moon makes the highest water here.
AS upon all the other Coasts of Portugal and Gallicia, so also here upon
these described Coasts, a northeast and southwest Moon makes high water, but
within the channels or rivers a streeke or two later, according as they reach
deep or far into the land. And because the flood here comes cross
against the land, and cross back from the land, so have you here no falling
of streams.

IIII. How these Countries lie distant one from the other.
FRom Barlinges to Roxent s. and by e. and s.s.e. 16 leagues. From Cape de
Fisiron, Pineche, or Nova Lisbona to Roxent south and north 15 or 16 leagues.
From Roxent to Cape de Spichel, or S. Uves-point southeast and by south 11
leagues. From C. de Spichel to C. S. Vincent s. and s. and by e. 29 leagues.

map of the coasts of Algarve and Andalusia

CHAPTER XI. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Algarve and Andalusia, lying
between Cabo de S. Vincent and the Strait of Gibraltar.
I. The situation between Cape S. Vincent and Cape de S. Maria.
RIght east from Cape S. Vincent about the second point in the Sand-baye, Rode
under Cape S. Vincent
there is good Rode for a northwest and north-windes, at 14 or 15 fathom, from
Cape de S. Vincent to Cape de S. Maria or Faro, east or a little southerlyer 19
or 20 leagues, between the^ both lies Lagos or Laves, Lagos or Laves.
and Villa Nova. From Cape de S. Vincent to Lagos it is east and by north seven
leagues, there is a tyde-haven which runs through between the rocks,
behind a girdle of Sand, but at a low water it is dry, there you may also
lie at anckor against a northwest, westnorthwest, and a north wind, at 10 or
12 fathom.

Villa Nova Villa Nova.
lies about four leagues eastward from Laves, between them both, almost three
leagues from Laves, and more then one from Villa Nova there lies a blind
rock, which you must think upon. Villa Nova is a fair haven, it runs in
north and north and by west, and at half flood you have therein two fathom
water. Within the haven on the east side there lies a little Island or rock,
whereon there stands a steeple or a house, and upon the land there stands a
great mast with a barrel upon it, when that steeple or house is right against
the said mast, then you must sail upon it right into the haven, by the
east-land, till you be past the steeple, the west side is flat and dry, then
when you come by the mast, you must turn up westward before the town of Villa
Nova, where you may anckor at four and five fathom.

From Villa Nova to Faro, Faro, C. Maria.
or Cape S. Maria it is about nine leagues, upon the strand there stands a
fire-beakon, and from the point there shoots off a Sand which you must
shu^ne, you must go in east to the haven of Faro, it reaches west, and west
northwest, you must leave the steeple on the left hand, and the strand of
Tavila on the right hand, running in at two or three fathom, and being in, you
may anckor right over against the town of Faro under the Island, at three
fathom, the chanel at half flood is two fathom deep.

To know this land when you come out of the Sea, you must understand that Cape
S. Maria is a round hillock, by the which you may know the whole land of
Condado.

Thus Cape S. Vincent shows it self when it lies seven leagues northwest
from you.
view of Cape Saint Vincent When Cape S. Maria lies northeast and by north
from you, then it shows thus.
view of Cabo de Santa Maria

II. To sail from Cape de S. Maria to Saltees.
FIve leagues northeast and by north from Cape de S. Maria or Faro lies
Tavila, Tavila.
which is a crooked dry haven, which almost every year alters, and is not
to be trusted to sail into it, unles it be first marked with beakons or boys,
at half flood it is scarce two fathom, and you lie right within the downs at
four fathom.

From Tavila to Aimonte Aimonte.
the course is e.n.e. five leagues.

Aimonte is a deep haven, and one of the best havens in all Condado, it
reaches in northwest by the east-land, and at half flood it is 3 fathom
deep, there lie some sands before the chanel, the marks thereof are these,
there stands a tree upon the east side of the haven, when Aimonte is over
against the tree, then you are east from the Sands, which lie before the haven,
then you go to the foot-strand, and run in along by it, n. w. and n.w. and
by w. and when you are in, then you must turn up northwards before the town,
or if you will be before Port Maria, then you must follow the n.w. course,
until you come before the castle, within it is wide and broad, and six or
seven fathom deep.

There goes in a haven also by the west-land, where you come cross in out of
the Sea, but that by the east-land is deepest.

From Aimonte to Leepe Lepe.
or S. Michaels S. Michael.
the course is e. and by n. seven leagues. Leepe has uncertain channels, which
you may not trust to sail into without a Pilot, for they alter continually,
now the chanel which lies east from the great Island is the best, from thence
you must turn up westward again to Taron, and to the River, and so come to
Leepe, where before the deep you take in your lading.

S. Michaels chanel was wont to run cross over into the Sea and with half
flood was three fathom deep, and before S. Michaels it is five fathom, from
whence with a high water a man may well go over the River to Leepe. Men were
wont to go in by Taron, but for security it is necessary to take in a Pilot.

From S. Michaels to Palos Palos.
or Saltes Saltes.
the course is east, and e. and by south seven leagues. Here you sail into
great Condado, this haven runs in by the west-ende of Red-downe, there
stands a great broad tree westward from the white cliffe, which you must hold
over against a red down, as if it were red earth, this down runs slope
downwards, run with these marks to the strand about north, and n. and by w.
then the steeple of Odier which stands above Wolves, will come over against
the east side of the chanel, hold it standing so, and sail along by the
strand, within two cables length, till you be about the point, then you may
run up north to Palos, or n. w. to Wolves, and there anckor at 6 or 7 fathom.

There within it is 6, 7 and also 3 and 4 fathom in sailing up, thereafter as
you sail up far or not. This chanel is at the threshold with half flood
three fathom and an half deep, within it is five fathom deep.

There comes also a chanel out of the Sea, running in between the Sands,
then Wolves will be on the east side of the chanel, and you must sail in
northnorthwest, and when you are within the haven, then do as aforesaid, this
chanel is three fathom deep.

To know the land heereaboutes you must understand, that on the west-ende of
Red-downe there lies a white shoringland somewhat cliffie, being redish earth
or chalck, he that falls upon it may think that he is by the haven of
Saltes, there stand some boxe-trees thereon, otherwise the land is clean
without trees, and it is reddish sand, and therefore is called Red-downe. Read
down.


III. To sail from Saltes to the River of S. Lucas.
FRom Saltes to the River of S. Lucas the course is s. e. and s.e. and by s.
distant about 8 or 9 leagues.

He that will sail into the River of S. Lucas, he must place the great tree
over the north-ende of the white closter which stands eastward from S. Lucas,
To sail into the River of S Lucas.
and sail out and in with those marks, and so at the dryest at low water and
dead stream, you shall have three fathom, and with high water and dead
stream you shall have 22 foot of scarce 4 fathom. Now when the castle of
Scipion and the church begin to come one upon the other, then you come to the
first stone or sand, and when the castle and the church are right over, or
against each other, then you are upon the dryest, and then they stand right s.
s. w. from you. And when the castle and the church come again through each
other, then you have deep water again, that is, three and an alf and four
fathom with low water and dead stream, then sail forward in with the same
marks of the closter and the tree, but you must look well before you, that
you bring not the mi^ (which stands east from S. Lucas) over against the
round closter, which stands right east beneath the town, but keep the^ a
bow length asunder, and so sail in through the best chanel or depth. But if
the round closter and the mill come one over against the other when you sail
in, then you shall touch upon the stones or sands. When you are over the
Sands and are gotten in, then sail to the strand of S. Lucas, until you see
the River clean open, to shun the Sand, which shoots off from the
northwest-point of the River, and sail along by the land, and anckor before
the church with the crosses, which stands below in the downs, at 5, 6, or
10, or 12 fathom, as near as you will, you may also laveere out of this haven
with indifferent ships or boats, but you must look well before you, for it
is not very wide.

By the land of Scipion there goes also a chanel in, to reach it, you must
sail in within two cables length close by the said land, until you are within
the second Sand, then you must turn or put off from the land, until you come
to the aforesaid marks of the closter and the great tree, then run forward
in upon them as aforesaid. S. Lucas River is good to know by Redde-downe, for
it lies on the east-ende thereof.

IIII. To sail from S. Lucas to Calis.
FRom Scipion to Calis Malis the course is southeast, nine leagues. Calis is
known by the Granado hill, when that is e.n.e. and e. and by n. from you, then
Calis lies e. and by n. from you, then sail up unto it, and you cannot miss
Calis.

Upon the point of Scipion Scipion.
there lie rocks, but they are above the water. And between the point of
Sipion and Calis, four leagues from Scipion lies Rottum, from whence there
shoots a great stone-riffe or sand.

Baye of Calis.
If you will sail into Calis Baye, you must run upon the rocks which lie
upon the west side of the Baye, which are called los Puercos, Los Puercos.
sail in upon them within two cables length, at 6 or seven fathom, till you
be before the town of Calis, and there anckor as deep as you will, at 8, 10,
12, or 15 fathom, it reaches in for the most part, e.s.e. and s.e. and by e.

But there lies a stone under the water which is called the Diamant, Diamant.
about n.n.e. and n.e. and by n. from Puercos, a little league, and when S.
Catherins chapel is e.n.e. from you, then you are against that stone or rock,
which at half flood has 3 fathom water upon it. The marks of this rock are
these, when S. Mary's church comes over the north end of Calis (which is a
closter standing without Calis) there stands also a house upon the hill,
which you go along by to Xeres, when that house comes over against the
chapel which stands upon the side of the water, westward from Marie-port,
when those marks are one over against the other, then you should sail upon
the stone, which at the dryest with high water is but 3 fathom and a half, but
set the two high hills which are south from the way to Xeres, so that they
may be a little asunder, and come not one under the other, then you sail not
upon this stone or rock.

The Puercos rocks lie about half a league from the north-point of Calis, he
that lies in the Rode before Calis, has the Puntal south or there aboutes
from him, after he comes near to Calis, but southward from Calis there lies
a rock, but go no nearer unto it then 7 fathom.

Calis Baye is wide and broad, and you anckor there at 5 or 6 fathom, a
northwest wind comes into it, therefore if any man will go in behind the
Puntal, he must go on southeast in between the point of Porte-real and the
Puntal, and then run up upon the point of Puntal, Rode behind Puntal.
where you lie safe from all winds, you may there also set a ship dry to
make it clean, and if you go into the Creek, then you must take in a Pilot,
and run into the water of Porte-real, and leave the Island on backborde, then
you shall get Herodes creek open, then sail in through the middle of the
chanel to the Salt-hilles.

When you sail to Calis the Granado-hill will stand east, and then it shows
thus.
view of Cadiz

V. To sail from Calis Malis through the Strait.
C. Trafalgar.
TO sail from Calis to the Strait, you must go south and s. and by e. to the
point of Trafalgar, then you run far enough without the banckes or rocks
which lie s. s. e. from Calis. From S. Sebastians point to the point of
Trafalgar it is s.s.e. 11 leagues. There lies a stony banck two leagues into
the Sea, west and by south from the Island of Tarifa, Tarifa.
which is 8 9 and 10 foot deep at the dryest, when the wind blows hard you
may see the Sea ravle upon it. If you will enter into the Strait, you must
sail close by the land, or far from the land, but it is best in the middle
of the Strait, when you are as far from the land on the one side as on the
other. From the point of Trafalgar or Tarifa to Gibraltar the course is e. and
e. and by s. 5 leagues. On the west side of Gibraltar there is a fair Rode to
anckor in, Rode before Gibraltar.
where also it is good anckoring, but a southwest wind blows into it, you
lie there safe against a west wind, and a south-winde blows just upon the
point of the land of Gibraltar.

C. Spartel.
Cape Trafalgar, and Cape de Spichel or Espartel lie distant s. and by e. and n.
and by w. 9 leagues. East from Cape de Spartel lies Tanger, Tanger.
in a great creek and sandbaye, there stands a castle upon the west-point of
Tanger, somewhat high, and then somewhat higher upon the hill there stands a
watchtowre, and east from Tanger there stands another broken watchtowre, so
that Tanger is good to know. When you are against Tanger, the coast to
Scheminckel-hill reaches most e.n.e. and e. and by n. therefore go e.n.e. and
e. and by n. forward, for that is the right course through the Strait. In the
night keep most upon the Barbary side, for it is very fair, and the Spanish
side is all foul. Gibraltar or Iubleter (as our sailors call it) and Seuta
Seuta.
lie distant s. and by e. and n. and by w. 8 leagues.

From Gibraltar to Maribella Maribella.
the course is n.e. and by n. it is a Rode to lade reasons, oil and other
fruits in.

From Gibraltar to Cap de Mol, on the west side of Malaga, the course is n.e.
24 leagues. When you lie in the Rode at Malaga, then that point lies about 3
or 4 leagues s.w. from you.

From Gibraltar to Velis Malaga Velis Malaga.
the course is n.e. and by e. about 33 leagues, and lies about 7 leagues
eastward from Malaga.

From Velis Malaga to Cape de Gato the course is e. and e. and by s. 16
leagues. From thence to Carthagena it is 19 leagues, that is a good haven,
there you lie safe from all winds.

At Malaga Malaga.
you lie at 15 or 16 fathom safe from a west-winde, but an east-winde blows
cornerwise. To know Malaga you must understand, that there stands a castle
on high, eastward from it, and there come two walls down from it to the Sea,
to another castle that stands upon the water, the rode is now before that
castle, for at the other rode it is foul, by means of casting of ballast into
it.

At Velis Malaga you lie at 14 fathom, with an east or Lavant wind it is
there open, but there is good ground.

At Maribella you may anckor at 12 or 13 fathom, there stands a steeple by
the water, bring that in the middle over against the town, and anckor there,
there is the best ground.

Thus the Spanish-coast shows it self when you are without the Strait, when
the north-point is about seven leagues north and by east, and the innermost
point northeast from you.
view of the Spanish coast When Tarifa is north from you, then the land shows
thus, and the point of Gibraltar lies northeast from you.

Tarifa.

view of Tarifa

VI. What Moon makes high water upon all this Coast.
AT Calis in the baye a s.s.w. moon makes a high water, and also in the
Strait of Gibraltar.

At Calis before the baye a s.w. and by s. and a n. e. and by n. moon makes a
high water.

Before the River of S. Lucas a s.w. and by s. and n.e. and by n. moon makes
high water.

Before the Condado a s.s.w. moon makes a high water.

Before Palos Moger and Wolves a south and north moon makes a full Sea.

At Cape S. Vincent and Cape S. Maria a southwest and n.e. moon makes a full
Sea.

The ebb falls without the Puercos south about to the Strait, and the flood
falls north about toward the land, but the most part of the flood falls
cross into the land about the Havens, a s.w. and by s. moon makes a high
water in the Strait, and when it is fair wether, commonly it is there four
hours flood and eight hours ebb, but the stream goes most part with the
wind, by this every man may guess how it is.

VII. How these Countries are distant one from the other.
FRom Cape S. Vincent to Lagos or Laves the course is east and by north 7
leagues. From Lagos to Villa Nova east 4 leagues. From Villa Nova to Cape Maria
or Faro e. and by s. 9 leagues. From C. Maria or Faro to Tavila n.e. and by e.
5 leagues. From Tavila to Aimonte e.n.e. 5 leagues. From Aimonte to Lepe e. and
by n. 7 leagues. From Lepe to Saltes or Palos e. and e. and by s. 7 leagues.
From Saltes to the River of S. Lucas or Sibiona southeast, and southeast and by
east 8 leagues. From S. Lucas or the point of Sibiona to the point of Calis

IX. Under what degrees these Places lie.
CApe S. Vincent and S. Maria lie under 37 degrees. The Coast of Condado lies
under 38 degrees. 15 and 20 min. The Island of Calis lies under 36 degrees 30
minutes. The middle of the Strait of Gibraltar lies under 35 degrees and 50
minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 12 and 13.
CHAPTER XII. A TRVE DESCRIPTION of the Seacoasts of Barbary, between Cape
de Spartel, or the Strait of Gibraltar and Cape de Geer.
I. From the Strait of Gibraltar to Cape de Cantin.
CApe de Spartel or Spichel (which is the south-point of the Strait of
Gibraltar) lies distant from the north-point, called Cape de Trafalgar south
and by east, C. Trafalgar.
and north and by west 9 leagues.

From Cape Spartel south 7 leagues lies Arsyla. Arsila.
Before Arsila there lies a row of rocks, where you may sail through at two
places, you may go at the north-chanel with great ships, but at the
south-chanel with small barks, and you must then anckor between the town and
the rocks.

From Arsila to Larage Larage.
or Alarache the course is south and by west 8 leagues, there runs in a
River to Larage, but it is very crooked and dry, you can not go into it with
any great ship, but only with barks and Frigates, you anckor there before
the Rode, at 16, 17 and 18 fathom. This coast reaches all south and by west,
and southsouthwest, it is from Larage to Mamora 20 leagues. Mamora Mamora.
lies upon a River, which is two fathom deep in the entry thereof, but in
the rode it is 20 fathom deep, a southwest moon makes a full Sea along this
coast. South from Mamora lies Salee, and from Salee Salee.
to Anafe or Algasse Anafe or Algasse.
it is southwest and by south, that is a great decayed town, you may yet see
five or six towers standing up, when you come to the land, it lies 19 leagues
east from Masagam. From Anafe to Azamor it is s.w. and by w. 14 or 16 leagues,
there you may anckor at 14 or 15 fathom, and there you lie safe against a
southwest wind. Two leagues more about west lies Masagam, he that will sail
to Masagam Masagam.
must know, that there are Pilots to bring in a ship, for it is a great
creek, but it is not too fair, so that many ships could not lie there upon
fair ground. On the west-point of the Baye there lie some rocks, which are
not seen at high water, but at low water they lie bare, when you lie in the
right Rode, then the west-point lies northwest from you, and the other point
east. West from Masagam there stands a tower upon a point.

From Masagam to Cape de Cantin it is westsouthwest 13 or 15 leagues, when you
come to Cape de Cantin, C. Cantin.
you must shu^ne the land somewhat, for there shoots off from it a hard rock
somewhat into the Sea.

Thus the land shows between Masagam and Cape Cantin, being very even and
low land all along to Saffia, you see nothing on it but a small tower by a
valley, which is called Casa Cavalgero.

Thus Casa Cavalgero shows when it is south from you seven leagues.

When the north-point of Saffia is southeast five leagues from you then it
shows thus.

When you are about seven leagues southwest and by west from Cape Cantin, then
it opens thus, then the point of Saffia is east southeast four leagues from
you, and shows thus.
view of Safi

II. The situation between Cape Cantin and Cape de Geer.
FRom Cap Cantin to the point of Saffia the course is south and somewhat
westerlyer 5 leagues. From Cape Cantin as aforesaid there shoots off a stony
Sand, which you must shun, when you are past that Sand you see two or three
rocks as a vessel or boat in a Sandbaye, and the land there is round about
black to look on, whereby you shall know that you are not far from the
point of Saffia. C. Cantin.
Cape Cantin is a low smoth point, whereon there stands a fire-towre, there
about it is all even and smothe land, as if it were Normandy, along from
Asamor to Saffia, so that you may know it well by the plainness. When you
sall a little northward from the point of Saffia, or put to land, then upon the
plain land you see two houses, the one (which is easterlyest) is called Casa
Cavalgero, and the other stands upon Cape de Cantin, which is the fire-towre
aforesaid.

He that will anckor in the Baye or Rode before Saffia, Saffia.
let him place the point a little more westerlyer then north from him, it is
there almost 18 fathom deep, but he that desires to set further within the
boucht, must set the northerlyest point of both, a ships length without the
other which lies nearest to you, then those points will be northnorthwest and
north and by west from you, and the thick tower on the south side of the
castle of Saffia, will then be east, and e. and by n. from you, there is the
best Rode at 10, 11 and 12 fathom, you may anckor also so much further inward,
until the points be almost hard by each other, and that the towers, which you
go by on land, are against the thick tower which stands above upon the
castle, there also it is good anckoring, this Baye is a round Baye or Creek,
when you fall southward from Saffia, you must understand that the land
southward from Saffia is high and uneven land, and most part double land, so
that thereby you may easily know whether you be north or south from Saffia,
for the land on the northside of Saffia (as I said before) is low and plain
ground.

From the point of Saffia to the Island of Mogodor it is south-southeast 16 or
17 leagues, Island of Mogodor.
and so the land reaches from Saffia to Mogodor, and also forth to Cape de
Geer, the land is all high and double land, and it is all fair sandy strand.

Against the north-ende of the Island Mogodor, there comes shooting off from
the fast land a great row of hard rocks, whereof the utmost, or they which
lie next to the Island Mogodor lie high above the water, he which comes out of
the north, and will sail beyond Mogodor, he must run between the Island, and
the foresaid rocks, hard by the rocks, it is in the entry between the Island
and the rocks five fathom deep. Within the foresaid rocks there lie on
baghborde certain other rocks, which at high water lie under water, and at
low water appear above water, when you come to the end of them, then you may
run about toward the firm land, and there anckor behind the rocks at 3
fathom low water: there is fair sandground, but notwithstanding there is not
very good riding: for because of the breaking of the Sea upon the aforesaid
rocks, it takes there very strongly, so that with a storm there is very
dangerous lying in that place: but further inward behind the Island it is good
lying at 2 fathom and an half. From the southende of the Island stretches out
a little rock toward the firmeland: almost against the foot-strand, but
southward from the foresaid little rock there stretches out a banck from the
firmeland a league into the Sea. If you will sail out at the southende, then
run along by the shore of the firme-land till you are about the foresaid
little rock, and then run out with the plummet by the banck: and then
presently you shall find deeper water as 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, fathom, then sail
whether you please.

From the point of Saffia to Cape de Geer it is south-southwest 48 leagues, C.
de Geer.
but from Mogodor the same course it is 31 leagues, between them both about
northeast 7 or 8 leagues from Cape de Geer, there lies a point called Cap de
Taffalana, Cap de Tafalana.
there you may anckor under it safe, against east and northeast winds, there
it is all sandy strand. Upon the south-point of Cape de Geer there stands a
castle, and when you are more then two leagues s.s.e. from Cap de Geer, then
you see it within the land, over the downe-land, and you may see the Moors
castle on the southende of the high-land.

He that will anckor in the Baye or in the Rode of Cape de Geer, Rode of C de
Geer.
he must run so far into the Creek till the Moors castle be north from
him, then the Christians packhouses will be northeast from him, and there it
will be 7 or 8 fathom deep, the north-point will then lie northwest and by
west from him, and there shoots out a little sand, against the castle there
lies a row of rocks under the water, and there southerly you go in to
anckor, against the Christians packhouses it is the best rode. But you must be
very careful in this Rode, touching your anckors, the tie-anckor must always
stand before the wind, which blows out from the land, the other anckors to
sea-ward, you must hold the sheet or plecht-anckor always ready against it
stormeth, then you must bring it out s. w. when it will be a storm, you may
see it before by the Sea-downes, you must also keep the fock-sayle ready upon
the yard, if you should chance to slip your anckor, that you may help your
self the best you can, in this Baye there is good store of fish to be taken,
when you are there at anckor, then they go by turn^s to fish, in the morning
by day, and come aborde again about 8 of the clock.

Thus the land southward from the south-point of the Baye of Saffia shows it
self when it is westnorthwest two leagues.
view of Morocco When you are westnorthwest, or cross from Mogodor two leagues
the land shows thus, and it is double and high land.

III. How these places are distant one from the other, and from other Countries.
HOw these places and lands are distant one from the other, for the most part
it is showed particulerly before. From Cape de Spartel to Cantin southwest and
somewhat southerlyer 75 leagues. From Cape de Cantin to Cape de Geer west 53
leagues. From Cape de Geer to Cape de Non southsouthwest, and south and by west
28 leagues. From Cape de Geer to the point of S. Crus s. e. 5 leagues. From Cap
de Non to O fin south 13 leagues. From Cap de Non to Cap Bayador s.w. and by w.
69 leagues. From Cape de Geer to Cape de Bayador southwest and somewhat
westerlyer 93 leagues. From Saffia to Madera east and west 131 leagues. From
Cape de Geer to Madera w. n. w. 133 leagues.
IIII. Under what degrees these Countries lie.
CApe Spichel or Spartel lies under 35 degrees 32 minur. Masagam lies under
32 degrees 52 minutes. Cape Cantin lies under 32 degrees 40 minutes. The I Will
of Mogodor lies under 31 degrees 32 minutes. Cape de Geer lies under 30
degrees. Cape de Non lies under 28 degrees 32 minutes. Cape de Bayador lies
under 27 degrees.
Here follows the Card N. 14 and 15.
CHAPTER XIII. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Canarie and Flemish Islands.
I. Of Lancerota, Forteventura, and great Canaria.
THe Islands of Canaria are seven in number, that is, Lancerota, Forteventura,
Great Canaria, Tenerifa, Gomera, Palma and Ferro.

The Island of Lancerota Lancerota
is distant from Cap de S. Vincent s. s. w. about 166 leagues. It has a haven
at the northeast end, between the two Islands Alegranca and Gratiosa, and you
come in from northward, you may run there so far in that you may come by
Lancerota again into the Sea, there it is 10, 15 and 20 fathom deep, and
there men lie safe from all winds.

On the east side of Lancerota there is also a good Rode, before the town, but
there lies a banck northward which you must shun, you must run southward
about the banck, and then anckor at 10, 11, or 12 fathom.

Between Lancerota and Forteventura, Forteventura.
there lies an Island where you may anckor on both sides at 15 or 20 fathom.

At the Island Forteventura you may anckor under the north and south ends at 15
and 20 fathom, and also on the northwest and southeast sides. On the southeast
or east side you may anckor before the town of Forteventura, at 15 or 16
fathom, there is a fair Rode.

At the northwest side you may anckor before the village at 20, 25 or 30
fathom, as deep as you will, the land on the northwest-side runs up with a
great boucht. It is from the northerlyest Islands of Lancerota to the west-point
or Forteventura about 33 leagues.

The Island of Great Canaria Great Canaria.
lies distant from Forteventura e. and w. 18 or 20 leagues. He that will sail
into the Rode of Great Canaria he must understand, that the Rode lies behind
the northeast point; on the east side of the land, right against the castle
which stands upon a point of land, when the said northeast point lies s. e.
6 or 7 leagues from you, then it seems to be an Island, for it is fast to the
other land only by a sandy strand, and that strand is not broad, and the
northeast point is very high. He that will put into the Rode, he must sail
about by the northeast point, The Rode of Great Canaria.
until the castle lies about n. w. and by n. from him, and there anckor at 8,
9, 10 or 12 fathom, then the north-point lies n. e. and by n. from you, and
the south-point s. s. e. On the south side of Great Canaria there is a fair
Baye, where a man may also anckor well.

Thus the northwest-side of Canaria shows it self.
view of Gran Canaria

II. The situation of the Island of Tenerifa.
FRom the north-point of Canaria to the northeast-point of Tenerifa it is w. n.
w. and e. s. e. 21 leagues. Rode of S. Crus.
In Tenerifa the rode is on the southeast-side, before the town of S. Crus,
where there is a fair Sand-baye, right north from the town is the best Rode
at 20 and 24 fathom, then Punto de Nago the northeast-point, lies about n. n.
e. from you, and the south-point of Tenerifa will then be s. and by west from
you. When the Pico of Tenerifa is westsouthwest from you, then you are open
before the Rode of S. Crus, and when you lie in the Rode of Pascaarte vande

map of the Azores S. Crus then you may see the Island of Great Canaria, which
lies southeast from thence about 13 leagues.

On the northwest-side of Tenerifa lies the Rode of Gerrachia, Rode of
Gerrachia.
and it is from the north-point of Punte de Nago to Gerrachia w. s. w. and saw
s. w. and by w. 8 leagues. He that will anckor before Gerrachia, he must anckor
westward from the rock with the cross, called the Lion, that the said rock may
lie southeast and by east and southeast from him, then you lie right before the
town, and then you look right into the street of the town, through S.
Dominicus closter, there it is fair ground at 36 or 40 fathom, then the Pico
will lie right west by the town. You may anckor no nearer to the land then at
35 or 36 fathom, nearer on the land or on the rock it is not fair, and
westward to the Sand called Lapania it is also foul ground. This is a naughty
Rode, therefore they that come here must look well to themselves, and have a
care of their anckors and cables, and keep them fix and ready, as also their
sails, that they may move when it stormeth.

There is also a small haven before Gerrachia, wherein men may lie with a few
ships; but to sail into it, you must have a Pilot, on the west side of the
haven there lies a rock under the water, but it ravels always upon it, within
the haven you anckor always at 5 or 6 fathom, and you must put out two
anckors before toward the Sea, with a cable upon the rocks, and an anckor
behind upon the land, that the ship may not wind, and the ground is there
foul, you must keep your cables well with boys and tonnes, to keep them
from the ground, this is a good haven in Summer, for then commonly it is good
wether, but in winter I counsel you not to put in with your sh^ppe there, for
the waves of the Sea come out of the n. w. sometim^s running in so stiffly, that
it is not possible to hold a ship, although it had ten anckors out. It
happened certain years past, that a number of ships were cast away in that
haven, and a good many houses of that town were washed away with the water.

Between Gerrachia and the east-ende of Tenerifa; there are three places more
to lade wine in, that is Laramela, Relecho, and Oratana. La^^mela, R^^^cho, and
Oratana.


On the southwest-ende of Tenerifa there is another little haven or baye called
Adessa, where also it is good anckoring, but a s.w. wind blows open into it,
there you lade much wine.

Thus Tenerifa shows when the Pico is westsouthwest from you, and then you
are open before the Rode of S. Crus.
view of Tenerife When the Pico is southeast from you it shows thus, and then
you are open before the Rode of Gerrachia.
view of Tenerife

III. Of the Islands of Palma Gomera and Ferro.
FRom Tenerifa to the Island la Palma Le Palma.
the course is w. n. w. 20 leagues, in the I Will of Palma there is a town, where
men use to lade, called S. Crus, which lies about the middle, on the
southeast-side of la Palma, it is a fair baye. If you come from the north and
desire to anckor in the Rode of Palma, you must run in so far in the
creek, until that you be southward or past by the head or the bridge, and then
anckor at 25 or 30 fathom. But in winter time you must not anckor so near the
strand, because of southeast, and southsoutheast winds, for then you should
lie to near the strand, you must there put out two anckors at one hole, and a
tye-anckor behind, to keep the ship right in the Rode, there lies a high
white rock with a cross east from the town, there is the best rode, right
north from the town there is a fair Sand-baye, there it is good anckoring at
20, 30 or 35 fathom, thereafter as men lie far off, this Rode is called
Rammel-rode, when you lie in the rode of Palma, you may from thence see the
Pico of Tenerifa e. s. e. from you, the Island of Palma is very high and full
of trees, whereby it is well known, On the southwest-side of Palma also there
is a place where you may lade wines, which is called Tassa Corda. Tassa Corda.


About five leagues west from the west-ende of Tenerifa lies the Island Gomera,
Gomera.
which on the north-side has a good haven of 10 fathom deep, where it is
good lying for almost all winds, better then in any of the other Islands, but
there is nothing to be laden, you may anckor before the haven at 20 fathom,
there also you must shift anckor-place, as at Gerrachia. The rode of Adessa in
Tenerifa lies there right against it, east from it, about five leagues. When
you lie at Gomera, then the rode of Palma is northwest and by north from you 16
leagues.

The Island Ferro I. Ferro.
lies from the I Will Palma south and by west 13 leagues distant.

Thus the I Will of Palma shows it self when it is about east 16 or 17 leagues
from you.
view of La Palma Thus the Island of Palma shows vhen it is south, and south
and by east from you nine or ten leagues.
view of La Palma Thus the Island of Palma shows it self when it is southwest
and by south from you four or five leagues.
view of La Palma

IIII. The Islands Salvages, Madera and Porto Santo.
GReat Canaria and Salvages Salvages.
lie distant from each other n. n.w. and s.s.e. 40 leagues. Southwest from
Salvages lies a rock, which a far off shows like a sail, it lies 3
leagues from the I Will, under the southeast-side of the Island, it is a good rode
for a northwest and west wind, it reaches s.w. and n.e. to the uttermost
rock, and it is fair ground 15 or 16 fathom deep, it is but half a league
long. The west-ende of Salvages is foul far of, therefore you must shun
it, and therefore choose rather to sail eastward then westward about it.

Forty leagues north from Salvages lie the Serters, Serters.
which are three little Islands, lying on the east-ende of the Island of Madera,
whereof the nearest to the land is the smalest, and lies about a league from
the land, that which is farthest from the land is the greatest, and lies four
leagues from the land, if you come out of the north, or from Porto Santo, you
may sail well through between the Island of Madera and the Serters, there it is
wide and broad enough, but from the east-ende of Madera Madera.
there lies a blind rock in the Sea, which you must shun. In the Island of
Madera, before the town of S. Crus S. Crus.
it is a good rode at 20 fathom, but before Fonsyael Fonsyael.
it is the right rode to lade at, by the Lion it is best to lie at 30 or 40
fathom. On the southwest-side before Marasylo Marasylo.
it is also good anckoring at 16 and 18 fathom, there it is good ground in
every place.

Porto Santo Porto Santo.
lies from Madera northeast 13 or 14 leagues it reaches most s.e. and n.w. At
each end of the Island lies a great rock, the Rode is on the southwest-side,
east from the cragged rock before the haven, where you may lie safe with barks.

When Salvages is e.n.e. from you five leagues it shows thus.
view of the Savage Islands When Salvages is e.s.e. five leagues from you it
shows thus.
view of the Savage Islands Thus the Island of Madera shows when you come out
of the north, and that the middle of the Island is twelve or therteene leagues
from you, the southeast end is very cragged when it is near unto you, and
the northwest-ende goes slopeing down, and it is a steep point.
view of Madeira Thus the Island of Madera shows when it is southwest from you.
view of Madeira When Madera is westsouthwest from you therteene leagues it
shows thus.
view of Madiera When Madera is s. from you 16 leagues it shows thus.
view of Madeira When Porto Santo is southwest from you about nine leagues it
shows thus.
view of Porto Santo Thus Porto Santo shows, about southeast from you six or
seven leagues.
view of Porto Santo

V. Of the Flemish Islands, S. Michaels, Tercera and Fayael.
MAdera and the Island of S. Michael S. Mi^haels.
lie distant from each other northwest and southeast 136 leagues. If you desire
to anckor under S. Michaels, you must understa^d that the Rode is on the
southwest-side of the Island, coming about the east or west-point of the Island
you shall see two towns, before the westerlyest is the Rode at 20 and 25
fathom, this town is called Punto del Gada, or Punt Algato, there the coast
reaches w.n.w. and e.s.e. to a town called Villa Franco, the elyeth an Island
before it, between the Island and S. Michaels it is deep 5, 6 and 7 fathom.

From S. Michaels to Tercera the course is n. w. and by w. 35 ^eagues, (...)
under Tercera the rode is on the south side of the land, west from the rocks,
right before the town of Angra, between two points reaching out, whereof the
westerlyest reaches a good way into the Sea, and on the end thereof has two
very high hills. This point is called Bresil, and when you come out of the
Sea, it shows from far as if it were separated from the land, upon each of
these points sticking out, there stands a castle for defense of the ships,
which lie there in the Rode, it is there in the Rode deep 20 and 25 fathom,
and on the west side of the aforesaid point of Bresil, there is a great
Sandbaye to anckor in, where there is a village called S. Martens, if you come
from the north, or the east, and desire to anckor in the Rode of T^^c^ra, you
must sail upon the land about the east-point, and sail all along by the two
Islands called the Ilheos, which lie a little east from the Rode, you may sail
through between those Islands and Tercera, it is 15 fathom deep between
them, and you may sometimes go without the Islands, and sail so long westward,
until you come to the aforesaid point of Bresil, there you may anckor right
east before the town of Angra at 10 or 12 fathom, or commonly men set the
Sea-anckor at 16 fathom, and the tye-anckor toward the land, at 8 or 9
fathom, a southeast wind blows there flat in, between the two Islands
aforesaid it is 6 fathom deep sandy ground, and they lie about a bow shot
from each other. But between those Ilheos and the Island of Tercera, it is a
great canon shot distant. A little to Seaward from these Islands, there lie
three or four rocks above the water, which are called Los Frailes, and three
leagues east from the town of Angra, there lies a Creek called Port Iudeo,
Porto Iudeo.
there the Spaniards entered upon the land with all their power, when they
took the I Will of Tercera from the Portugales.

If you will go from Tercera to Fayal, Fayal.
hold your course w. s.w. to the east-point of S. George, which is distant from
thence 11 leagues, And through between the Pico and S. George to Fayal it is
16 leagues, it reaches most w. n. w. between them. The Island Fayal lies west
from Pico distant a league.

If you will anckor in the Rode before Fayal, you must anckor in the Creek
right before the village of Fayal, at 14 or 15 fathom, there it is
sand-ground, and there goes a strong stream both ebb and flood.

On the south-ende of Fayal lies a little haven, if you will sail into it, you
must go in by the southwest-point, and so long about by the land, until you
see the haven open, sail about by the southwest-point, until you come in the
narrow between the rocks, which lie off from the west side, and as soon as
you begin to come within the rocks, then let your anckor sall at 5 fathom,
and carry ropes on the east side of the land, to be made fast to the stakes
that are there purposely set. The haven is small, so that there cannot above
four or five ships lie in it, for further in it is all flat water.

Thus the Island of Tercera shows when it is east and by south about seven
leagues from you.
view of Terceira Vhen Tercera is four leagues southwest from you, then it
shows thus, the west-ende of Tercera is higher then the east-ende, and
therefore it is reasonable well to be known.
view of Terceira Thus the Island of S. George or Ioris shows when it is
westsouthwest from you seven leagues.
view of Terceira Thus the Island Gratiosa, when it lies westsouthwest four
leagues from you, shows it self.
view of Graciosa

VI. What Moon makes a high water at these Islands.
Upon all these Canarie Islands a s.w. and n.e. moon makes a natural tide, or
high water, as upon the coasts of Spain, Portugal, Gallicia, France, and other
places.

VII. How these Places lie distant from each other.

CHAPTER XIIII. A TRVE DESCRIPTION teaching how you may sail the Seacoasts
and Havens of the West, South and East Side of Ireland.
I. How to sail to the Havens of Gallowaye and Lemrick, and the Islands
thereaboutes.
TThe Island Blackrock Blackrock
and Cape Dorsey lie distant s. and by w. and somewhat southerlyer, and n. and
by e. and somewhat northerlyer 53 leagues: between them both lie the Havens of
Galloway and Lemrick.

If you will sail into Gallowaye, Galloway.
you must ru^ne in through between the Islands, or along by the firm land
northeast to the point Galor, then you must yet go in n. e. to the other
point, and then forward three leagues more s. and by e. till you be before the
town of Galloway, where you may anckor at 6 or 7 fathom, it is there all over
good anckor ground, a great depth and fair Creekes. You may also anckor well
without, behind the Islands at 12 fathom, there also it is good anckor ground
in every place.

From the Islands before Galloway to the Island of Aromen, Aromen.
it is about six leagues: behind the Island of Aromen it is also a good Rode:
the Island Calos Calos.
lies about a league southward from Aromen, and behind it also there is a
Rode.

From Aromen to the haven of Lemrick Lemrick.
it is about 5 leagues southwards, before the mouth of the said haven there lie
two rocks, the one south by the haven, and is called Cockuyt, the other north
by the haven, and is called Boy, you must sail in by Cockuyt, and run east,
and east and by north a league till you be about the point Blaway, and from
Blaway to the castle Lamor e. s. e. 4 leagues, and from the castle Lamor to
Griel south seven leagues, from Griel to Lemrick s. and by w. 4 leagues, there
you may anckor before the town at 6 or 7 fathom, you may also anckor before
Blaway, and there take in a Pilot, and he will bring you before the town.

Further it is from the Islands before Galloway to Blasquay B^asq^^y.
southsouthwest 18 leagues. From Blasquay to Dorsey Do^^^y.
southeast 2^ leagues. From Dorsey to Cabo de Claro e. and by s. 13 leagues.
II. What Havens and Places lie between Cabo de Claro and Cape Velho.
YOu may know Cape de Claro Cape de Claro.
by reason it is all broken land, when you come somewhat better east about, and
are by the land, you shall see a high point reaching out, which reaches far
without the other land into the Sea, the south-ende whereof is very much
shoring down, and on the highest part thereof there stands a castle with
three towers, which is decayed, the middle tower is yet the highest, it lies
12 leagues eastward from Cape de Claro, and right north from this out-point,
(by our sailors called Cape de Velho, Cape Velho or Oldhead.
and by the Englishmen Oldhead) lies the haven of Kinsale, a fair haven deep
and broad, coming from the east, or the west along by the land: this point
seems to be an Island, because on the west side it is low, but it is fast to
the firm land by a small piece of land, and there you may anckor under it on
both sides as dry as you will.

From Cape de Claro to the aforesaid Cape de Velho or Oldhead, the course is
east and by north 12 leagues. To go into the Islands of C. de Claro.
To run into the Islands of Cap de Claro, you must understand that there lies
a town westward upon the high land, you must there go east to land, and so
go in eastnortheast, leaving the low Island to landwards, and the uttermost
Island of Cape de Claro to seawards, and so running in to the second Island,
whereon the closter of Claro stands, there on the west-ende there is a sandy
baye, where you may anckor at eight or nine fathom.

There goes also a chanel into the Sea close alo^g by the west Island, which is
12 fathom deep, on the east side of the chanel there lies a rock above the
water, which you must shun, and in sailing out you leave it on the east side,
and right within the rock you may anckor.

If you will sail further into this haven of Cape de Claro, you must run
through between the Islands to Baldermore, Baldermore.
and shun somewhat the Island of Cape de Claro, for from it there run many
blind rocks, therefore you must sail to the other Island. But when you are
half way by the I Will of Cape de Claro, then you must make to the narrow way,
to go through it, it is therefore the most part all about three fathom deep,
but in the narrow way it is dry at low water, therefore you must go over
there with the tide, there you may anckor on what side you will, whether it be
under the closter at Claro, or on Baldermore-side, which is the east side,
where it is 5 and 6 fathom deep.

The haven of Baldermore goes in north, and in it it is 11 or 12 fathom deep
at low water, on the east-point of Baldermore there lie two high steep
rocks, as if they were steeples, the one somewhat higher then the other, and
there eastward there goes in a haven, which is called Castle-haven. And a
league eastward from it the Haven of Somrack, Somrack.
which is 8 or 9 fathom deep, before the haven there lies a great rock,
which you may run in by on both sides, but the east side is best, for the
west side is somewhat foul. To sail in by this rock it is distant at l^ast
the length of the shot of a great piece of Ordnance, you shall there find a
tower standing, and against it you may anckor at lowest water, it is there good
lying, in the middle there lie two blind rocks, which at half ebb are above
water, and between these two rocks, there lies a rock above the water,
therefore you must run in close by the land, leaving the rocks on backborde,
the haven is not above eight ships long in length, you may sail through
under these Islands of Cape de Claro in many places, and anckor, for it is all
broken land, as if it were Norwaie.

East from Somracke, and about 4 leagues west from the out-point of Kinsale
lies Rossen, Rossen.
a tyde-haven, which at a low water falls dry, you may see the church with
the towers in the valley, westsouthwest from the point there lies a stone
under the water.

There lies an Island between Rossen and Kinsale or Cape de Velho, also in the
creek, which is called Roem, which you may sail round about, and also anckor
behind it. Three leagues eastward from this Island Roem lies Cape de Velho or
Oldhead.

Thus the point of Rossen shows when it is west and by north from you.
view of 'Rossen' (Ireland)

III. How to sail into all the Havens between Cape de Velho and Waterford.
CApe de Velho (as I said before) is a high point reaching out, when it is the
length of the shot of a great piece, To sail into Kinsale.
or a quarter of a league s. s. w. from you, then you are open before the Haven
of Kinsale, and you may see into the same, and see the town of Kinsale lie on
starborde of the haven, this is a deep haven, and reaches in n. n. w. which
before it has no foul entry, but only a blind rock, which lies off from
the east-point of the haven, you may sail in in the middle of the water
between both the lands, there it is seven fathom deep, and when you are a
little within the castle, then you must turn up westward, and anckor on the
west side at 5, 6, and 7 fathom, you may also run in further and lie safe
against all winds, on either side there stands a flat tower, and there
eastward lie two black rocks a little within the Sea, not far from each
other, the one is called Kockul, and the other (which is the easterlyest) Rock.

He that comes out of the east, and would sail into the haven of Kinsale, he
must understand that there lies a blind rock which shoots off from the
east-point of the haven, (as I said before) therefore he must keep the rock
called Rock without the rock called Kockul, so long until that the castle
standing within on the east side of the haven comes without the east-point of
the haven, and then you take no hurt upon the blind rock, then sail in n.n.w.
and anckor at 6 or 7 fathom, as above said, the Haven of Kinsale lies from
the point with three towers north, and north and by west a great league.

Thus the point of Kinsale whereon the castle stands shows, when you are
half a league from it w.s.w, and then you see the haven of Kinsale open.
view of Kinsale

Thus the land shows right east from Kinsale.
view of Kinsale

When you are a league east from the two black rocks aforesaid, or three
leagues from Oldhead with the castle with three towers, and are close by the
land, then you see two steep hillockes or rocks in the land, as if they were
steeples, standing not far one from the other, which stand about two leagues
west from the mouth of the haven of Corck, Corck haven.
and when you are by the easterlyest hillock, then you may see the haven of
Corck, which reaches in n.n.w. within it is wide and broad, running into a
broad river, which goes up into the land, and right within the haven there
lies an Island, which may be sailed round about, but on the south side it is
good anckoring, at 6, 7 and 8 fathom, on the west side there lies a village,
by the which you sail up to the town of Corck, two leagues higher into the
land.

There stands a castle also from whence there shoots off a Sand, and there
within there lies a tyde-haven in a Sandbaye.

On the east side right about the point there stands a broken castle, upon
the low land, and somewhat more eastward in the valley there stands a
apiece tower, and about a great league east from the haven, there stands
a tower on high upon the point close by the water side, by the same there stand
ten or twelve straw howses, and a league more eastward (two ships length
from a low point) there lies a round long rock, which is grown green above,
and on the east side of the point stands a flat tower, which you may see
when you are a great pieces shot^e e. n. e. from the aforesaid round rock,
otherwise you see al low land to the point of Iochul.

This Haven of Corck at low water is 7 fathom, and also 10 fathom deep, so
that you may laveere it both out and in, and on the east side there lies a
row of rocks, about two ships length from it, which you must shun.

Thus the land shows which lies west from Corck.
view of Cork Thus the land shows east from Corck to Iochul.
view of Cork

About 4 leagues eastward from Corck lies a point called Balicot, Balicot.
behind it you may go and anckor at 4 or 5 fathom.

From Korck to Iochul Iochul.
it is e. n. e. almost 6 leagues, it is a tyde-haven, reaching along in by the
east-land n. w. and n. w. and by n. there lies a rock on the west side, and
the west side is a sandy strand along to the town.

He that will sail into Iochul must run under the Island of Tapul, and there
stay for an after-flood, then there is four fathom water upon the banck, then
sail north and by east upon a league right to the haven of Iochul, and when
you are within then anckor before the town where you will.

Between the point and the town there stands a closter, where also you may
anckor, and yet you may strike over to the east-land, and so run up the
river, within it is 3, 4, and 5 fathom deep, from the east side of the haven,
there come a row of rocks shooting off, well half way into the haven, and
right without these rocks it is at low water no more the^ 5 or 6 foot deep,
but at a high water it is deep enough.

About 5 leagues east from Iochul there lies a tyde-haven called Dongarvel,
Dongarvel.
which is also 8 leagues from Waterford, the same reaches in n. n. w. but in
the haven it is full of rocks, and at a low water it is dry, so that you
must go in at a full Sea, and run in between the rocks, it is a narrow
haven, but within it is deep enough, the town lies upon the west side of the
haven, and right n. w. within the land there lie three high hills, which are
called Cape de Quyn Cape de Quyn.
or Kary Quyn, whereby you may know this land, and when they lie n. n. w. from
you, then they are cross from you, and then you are right before the haven of
Dongarvel, when those hills lie n. n. e. from you, then you are before the
haven of Corck, and when they lie n. from you, then you are right before the
haven of Iochul, but when they lie n. w. from you, then you are right before
the haven of Waterford.

From Iochul to Waterford Waterford
it is e. n. e. 11 or 12 leagues.

The haven of Waterford reaches n. and n. and by w. in between two steep
lands, it is a fair wide haven, and 11 fathom deep as you enter in, but when
you are a little within, there lies a banck on the west side, which is long and
broad, coming almost into half the haven. Against this banck it is but three
fathom deep at low water: therefore when you are a little within you must
choose the east side, and sail close by the castle, which stands within the
haven, and when you are within the castle then you find 7 fathom deep, and
when you are at the end of the banck, then you must turn to the west side,
and anckor at 4 or 5 fathom, before the little town of Passagie, from whence
the River goes westward further into the land.

On the west side of the haven it is all flat high land, and on the east side
there stands a high white flat tower, which is called Balmus, Balmus.
whereby the haven of Waterford is well to be known. Two leagues east from
Iochul there stands also another high tower called Ardimore, but it is black,
that you may see 4 leagues into the Sea, between the out-point of Kinsale and
Waterford along by the whole coast, there stand many other flat towers, but
that by Waterford stands further out, because it is great and high. And the
aforesaid three high hills called Cape de Quyn are very good and known
marks, whereby this Coast of Ireland is well descried and known. A league
east from Kinsale there lie two black rocks, and west from Iochul there lie
two round rocks, which are overgrowne with green weeds, otherwise there are
no rocks upon this Coast.

The Islands of Saltees lie east from Waterford, and you may sail from
Waterford through between the Islands of Saltees and the firm land.

IIII. How you shall sail by the east side of Ireland from Saltees to Dondalck.
FRom the Islands of Saltees to the haven of Watchford Watchford.
it is 5 leagues, he that will sail into Watchford, he must set the tower
(standing upon the north-side inward within the haven) west and by north from
him, then he shall run between Saltbanck and Watchbanck, sailing in between
both the lands, and set within about the point at 4 or 5 fathom.

From Watchford to Wexfofd Wexford.
it is n. and by w. 5 leagues. He that will go into Wexford, he must bring the
town of Wexford (lying on the north-side in the haven) west from him, so he
shall sail between Watchbanck and Griel, where between both the banckes it
is 10 and 12 fathom deep, then sail in forward west, and shun the
south-point of the haven, for it is somewhat foul, and when you are within
then sail along by the south side, till you come before the town of Wexford,
and and anckor at 4 or 5 fathom.

From Wexford to Dublin Dublin.
it is n. and n. and by w. 5 leagues. He that will sail into Dublin must bring
the tower (standing on the north-side of the haven) w. n. w. from him, sailing
in between the banck called Griel, and the sand of the Island Lambaye, Lambaye.
between them both it is 12 fathom deep, sail al along by Lambaye at 7
fathom, and run so at seven fathom by the sands to the haven, shunning the
south-point, for that is foul, therefore hold the northerlyest tower in Dublin
on the second point upon the south side, then you cannot miscarie, then sail
about the second point, and then turn up westward and anckor before the town
at 4 or 5 fathom.

Under Lambaye there is also a good Rode, in the boucht at 7 or 8 fathom. You
may also sail through between Lambaye and Dagalbanck Dagalbanck.
to Dublin.

Five leagues north from Dublin lies the haven of Drodag. Drodag.
He that will sail into it he must bring the tower (standing upon the
northside of the haven) w. n. w. from him, as the line shows, to shun the
foul way which runs off from the south-point, and so sail westward in,
until he be in, then turning to the south side, he must sail in between the
south side and the Island of Carol, which lies in the middle of the haven, and
sail till you be before the town of Drodag, and anckor at 4 or 5 fathom.
From Dublin to Drodag it is 8 leagues. On the north side of the haven of Drodag
there lie three Islands.

From Drodag to Dondalck Dondalck.
it is north 7 leagues. He that will sail in there must know, that on the
south side of the haven of Drodag there stands a castle, you must sail in by
the south side, keeping the tower, which stands north from Dondalck, over the
round point of the north-side, as the line shows, for from the north point of
the haven there runs a row of rocks, therefore you must sail in by the
south side till you be about the point, and then turn up southward, and anckor
before the town at 4, 5, 6 and 7 fathom. East from Dondalck there lie also
five or six Islands.

V. What Moon makes high water in these places.
ON all the havens and places lying on the West-coast of Ireland a northeast
and southwest moon makes a high water. But on the South-coasts a w. s. w. and
e. n. e. moon, but within the channels or haven a point later, that is a west
and by south, and an east and by north moon.

In the open water and in the chanel without the land a s. w. and northeast
moon.

VI. Of the falling and running of the streams.
Without Cape de Claro by the land the flood falls east and the ebb west.

Between Cape de Claro and Waterford the flood falls eastnortheast along by
the land.

In the chanel of Galls or S. John between England and Ireland the stream
falls northeast and southwest.

VII. Of the ground and depths of Ireland, and how you may know the land.
Between Cape de Claro and the point of Dorsey you may see the land at 58 and
60 fathom.

Between Cape de Claro and Waterford you may see the land at 45 fathom, and
you may see all the coast of Ireland at 35 and 40 fathom, and at 35 fathom
you are not far without the land, and therefore by night you must go no
nearer to Ireland then 40 fathom.

VIII. How these places are distant from each other.
FRom Cape de Claro to Cape Velho e. and by n. 12 leagues. From Cape Velho to
Kinsale n. and by w. a great league. From Cape Velho to Corck n. e. and by e. a
great league. From Corck to the east-point of Waterford e. n. e. 20 leagues.
From Cape de Velho to the Islands of Waterford eastnortheast 29 leagues.
The whole South-coast stretches e. n. e. and w. s. w.

IX. How these places are distant from others.
FRom Gallowaye to the Islands of Aran w. s. w. 8 leagues. From Blackrock to
Rokot n. and by w. 60 leagues. From Cape Dorsey to the Sorrels s. e. and by e.
58 leagues. From Cape Dorsey to Cape Finisterre south and by east, and south
164 leagues. From Cape de Claro to Englands end s. e. and by e. 54 leagues.
From Cape de Claro to the Sorrels southeast 47 leagues. From Cape de Claro to
Cape de Finisterre south 164 leagues. From Cape de Velho to Englands end s. e.
46 leagues. From Cape de Claro to Sorrels s. e. and by s. 40 leagues. From
Waterford to Gresholme e. and by s. 21 leagues. From Waterford to Milford east
and by south and somewhat southerlyer 23 leagues. From Waterford to Englands
end south and by east and somewhat easterlyer 37 leagues. From Waterford to
the Sorrels south and somewhat easterlyer 40 leagues. From Waterford to Cape de
Finisterre s. and by w. 168 leagues. or 170 leagues.

X. Under what degrees these Countries lie.
CApe de Claro lies under 51 degrees 20 minutes, or as some say 51 degrees 38
minutes.
Cape de Velho or Oldhead lies under 51 degrees. 28 min. or as some say 51
degrees 42 minutes.
Waterford or the tower lies under 52 degrees 4 minutes, or as some say 52
degrees just.

Here follows the Card N. 17.
CHAPTER XV. A DECLARATION HOW to sail by the Seacoasts and Havens of
Wales: Also from the Chanel of Bristowe to Englands end, and to the Sorlinges.
I. How to sail by Wales, from Ramsey to the Naes, and to Cardif.
IT is from the Islands of Saltees in Ireland to the Island of Ramsey, Ramsey.
or the north-point of Wales, east and by south 19 leagues. Right north from
Ramsey lies the Bishop with his Clerks, The Bishop with his Clerks.
which are certain rocks, which run out a good way from the north-point of
Wales s. w. into the Sea. Upon the said North-point there lies a town, called
S. Davies, and from thence northward the land reaches northeast and southwest.

Two leagues southward from Ramsey, lies the Island of Gresholme, Gresholm.
and there between them both lies the Broad-baye, Broad-baye.
to go into it you must sail through between the aforesaid Islands or Rocks,
the one lies on the north-side, the other on the south side, it is a good Rode
for ships that will go to Bristowe, and it is there safe lying against
north, northeast, and east-windes, at 7, 8 and 9 fathom. The said Islands are
well to be known, thereby to know the said point of Wales, the land there
reaches n. n. w. and s. s. e.

Right south from the Island of Gresholme lies Milford haven, Milford haven.
which first reaches in n. e. which is a deep and wide haven, in the middle
thereof there lies an Island, within it is very good anckoring, for it is a
good haven. About five English miles within the land there lies a town called
Carcewe.

Two leagues eastward from Milford lies S. Gawins point, S. Gawins point.
which is the south-point of Wales, which is also called the White-point.

Four or five leagues eastward from S. Grawins point lies the Island of Caldye,
Caldye.
where you may anckor round about against all winds. This Island lies before a
great Creek, which al over is good rode. He that will go before the town of
Tinbuy Tinbuy.
he must take heed of a row of blind rocks, which lie northwards from
Caldye under the Water, but if you will sail to Tinbuy, eastward from Caldye,
you may sail close along by the Island: you may also come about west from
Caldye, but there it is not very wide, it is a strait way, but all through it
is deep enough, and being east from the rocks you may anckor well.

East from the Island of Caldye there lies a white point, called
Wormshead-point, Worms point.
which has many white chalck spots on the land, whereby that point is well
to be known. There eastward it is a good rode for west, north, and northeast
and by east winds, in a great creek, and southeast from this out-point there
lies a great banck, which reaches off from the Naes The Naes.
w. and by s. and w. s. w. five leagues.

You may also sail through this banck and the Naes to Cardyf or the Holme
before Bristowe, and this sand is called Naes-sand.

He that will go into this baye or creek eastward, he must sail in close by
the Nase, or he must come out of the west, there it is wide and broad.

East from the Nase there lie two Islands, close by the coast of Wales, the one
called Barrey, Barrey and Sily.
the other Sily. Cardyf and Flatholme lie eastward from them, the north-side is
most dry and flat water.

Cardyf Cardyf.
is a tyde-haven, but there is a very fair rode for ships that will go about
east or west, for there lie many sands eastward, which at low water are dry.

He that will go into the rode of Cardyf, he must run in between Flatholme
and the point of Cardyf, but there lies a rock in the haven which he must
shun, there lies also a stone s. e. and s. e. and by e. from the west-point
of the land under the water: but when it is high water you may go over all
that that at half flood is not covered. Cardyf Rode is a fair rode, where you
may lie safe against all winds.

view of Wales

II. To sail from Naes and the Holme to Bristowe.
HE that will sail from the Naes to Bristowe, he must go to the Stepeholme,
Stepeholm
which lies e. s. e. about seven leagues from thence, you must sail north
along by it, and leave Flatholme Flatholm.
on backborde, which lies somewhat more inwards then St^peholme.

But he that will sail from Londey to Bristow, he must keep the English side
to the Naes, then he is within the great banck which runs along by Wales,
called the Naes sand, you may also sail with ships that draw but little water
from the Stepeholme, with half flood, but there it is very flat, there is
but two fathom water at lowest water, and under Stepeholme you may anckor when
you will at 4 and 5 fathom.

To sail in the right chanel through between the Holme, you must go nearest
to Flatholme side, for there is the deepest water, with an open wind you may
sail as near as you will, yea so near as that you may cast a stone thereon.
From the east-land there comes a shallowe shooting off, under which a man may
sail as he comes out of the west. To shun this shallowe as you will sail
from Flatholme to Brust, set Flatholme when you are past it, southwest from
you, and hold it so, until you have sailed a Dutch mile, then observe a little
Island, which lies almost thwart against you, upon the English coast, whereon
stand two milles, and upon the height of the firm land stands one mill: now
when the mill which stands upon the high land comes upon the west-ende of
the Island, then you are past the point of the foresaid English ground, so that
then you cannot sail under it, then go eastnortheast by the English ground,
which you may sail with your plummet at 3, 4, or 5 fathom, or you may come as
near as you will, for it is very flat. When the mill which stands upon
the high land comes to stand between both the milles which stand upon the
foresaid Island, then are you wholly past the English ground, then boldly sail
toward the English coast, and so close along if you please to Passis point,
keep along by the foresaid coast, and sail close about the corner of Passies
point, when you are about the point so anckor there at the Kings rode, betwixt
the point and the River of Brust, next to the River, at 8 or 9 fathom, there
is good clay ground. He that will go into the River, shall be conducted by the
Pilots. It is from Flatholm to Passies point deep in the chanel 14 or 15
fathom at half flood. Here you must keep the English side, for the side of
Wales is very uneve^ and full of banckes, which in many places fall dry, you
come no nearer that coast then 12 fathom, for in sailing toward the coast at
one cast you shall have 10 fathom, and at the next be fast on ground, and that
wholly from Flatholme to over against Brust. When you are about Passies point
you may sail along by the coast forward northerly to the River of Severne,
that is also a fair River as Brust, fit to sail into.

Thus the land of England shows from Axbridge westward to Ilfordcombe, when
you sail along by it.
view of England

III. To sail into the Havens between the Holms and the Sorlinges.
Between the Holmes and Ilfordcombe on the English side, and between the
banckes on the Welsh side in the middle of the chanel, it is 15, 16, 18, 20, 25
and 30 fathom deep, the nearer you come to the Holms the flatter water it is.
When you come from the west, and are within the Island of Londey, then you may
see the land on both sides, that is, both England and Wales.

In this chanel behind England many ships in times past were wont to many
times to overshoote themselves, How it comes that ships sail behind
England and mistake their course.
which was for want that they had not taken their heigths well, and thought
that they were in the chanel between England and France. And it happens
sometimes at this time also, and that by their own default, whereby it is to
be marked, how necessary it is for a Sayler to be skillful therein. But he to
whom it may happen so hereafter may hereby understand the situation of these
parts, all the coast of England, from the end of England to the Holme, is
altogether fair, but the Welsh coast is most part all foul and flat water,
from the River of Bristowe to Caldye, and lies most full of bancks and sands,
as I said before.

Now to sail out of the chanel of Bristowe, it is from the Holme to Londey w.
s. w. 19 leagues.

And 11 leagues west from the Holmes lies Ilford-combe, Ilford-combe.
which is a haven which at low water is 3 or 4 fathom deep. Before the haven
it is good rode at 8 and 9 fathom, half flood.

From Ilfordcombe to Bedeford Bedeford.
it is s.s.w. 7 leagues. It is a Tyde-haven, but a fair chanel, where many
ships may go out and in, it devideth it self into two Rivers, upon the east
River there lies a town called Barnestable, and on the right side as you go
in Bedeford lies.

From Bedeford to the west-ende of Londey Londey.
it is n. n. w. five leagues. Under Londey you may anckor on both sides at 14
and 15 fathom.

From the point of Bedeford to Hartland point Hartland-point.
are 7 or 8 leagues. This out-point lies right west from Londey.

From this point to Padstowe Padstowe.
or Stoupart the course is s. w. and n. e. 7 leagues. Stoupart is a creek,
where there is a good rode at 7 or 8 fathom. On the west side there lies a
blind rock under the water, and at the point there lies a rock high above the
water. West from this point there are many white sandy bays, or chalck-bayes
in the land, whereby it is a good land to be known.

Between Padstowe or Stoupart and the Cape of Cornwall lies the haven of S.
Ives, S. Ives.
(by the Hollanders called S. Uves) on the east side there lies an Island or a
great rock above the water, and the town stands upon the west-point of the
land, there you must run in between the rocks and the west-point, then
turn up westward, and anckor before the town at 6 and 7 fathom, this haven
at half flood is 14 fathom deep.

From Stoupart to Cape of Cornwall The Cape of Cornwall.
s. w. and by s. and somewhat westerlyer, and n. e. and by n. and somewhat
easterlyer 12 leagues, and from S. Ives aforesaid it is five leagues.

From the Cape of Cornewal there lies an Island or rock inwards to the Sea,
called Bresam, Bresam.
you may sail through between the Cape and the said Island to Englands end.
Englands end lies from the Cape of Cornwall south about 5 leagues, the
situation thereof, as also of Sorrels is showed in the next Chapter.

IN the Chanel of Bristowe, between Londey and Milford, the stream falls n.
e. and by e. and n. e.

At Ramsey in the Chanel of S. Davies the flood falls northeast and by north.

In the Chanel of Bristowe within the Holme the flood falls n. e. and by e.

V. What Moon makes a high water in all the places aforesaid.
AT Milford or Wilford a west and by south moon makes high water.

Likewise on the Coast of Wales a west and by south moon makes a full Sea.

Also against the Island of Londey a west and by south moon makes high water.

At the Island of Londey and the Holmes it is high water with an east and west
moon.

Within at Bristow it is high water with a w. and by n. moon.

In the Sorrels a s. w. and by w. moon makes a high water.

Without the Sorrels in the chanel a s. w. and by w. moon.

VI. Of the depths here, and at what depths you may see the Land, and how it
is to be known.
Between Englands end and Londey in the chanel it is 45 fathom deep, and
you may see Cornwall at 44 fathom.

At Wales about Milford, and there northward from it you may see the land at 42
and 45 fathom.

In the Chanel between the Holmes and Bristowe it is 12, 13 and 14 fathom
deep, and you see the land on both sides, the English land is the fairest.

You may see Sorlinges at 45 and 46 fathom, and the ground is oasie, with some
small stones among it. Eleven or 12 leagues w. n. w. and w. and by n. from
Sorrels it is 56 and 57 fathom deep, and the ground there is so soft that you
can hardly get it to stick upon the lead, and sometimes you shall have small
shelles.

Between Hartland point and S. Ives, against Padstowe or Stupaert, there are
many white chalck hills, and so all along to the end of England, whereby you
may know that Coast, upon Englands end you see always a tower or two. When
you are n. from the Sorrels, then you see a tower or castle upon the east
Island, and the Sorrels then lie most upon two Islands although they are more
then two, and without upon the easterlyest of the Islands there lie two great
rocks, which are very craggie like hillockes, and without at the uttermost
there lie three high black rocks, whereby you may learn to know these Lands.

VII. How these places are distant from each other.
FRom Ramsey to Milford s. and by e. 5 leagues. From Milford to S. Gawins point
s. e. and by s. 4 leagues. From S. Gawins point to the Nase e. and somewhat s.
17 leag. From the Nase to Stepeholme e. s. e. about 7 leagues. From Stepeholme

Cape of Cornwall s. w. 12 or 13 leagues. From Milford to Londey s. and by e. and
s. s. e. 12 or 13 leagues. From Milford to Englands end or the Cape of
Cornwall southsouthwest 32 leagues. From Milford to the Sorrels southsouthwest
and somewhat westerlyer 40 leagues.
How these places are distant from the Havens of Ireland it is showed in the
chapter before.

VIII. Under what degrees these Places lie.
THe Haven of Milford lies under 51 degrees 50 minut. Londey lies under 50
degrees 20 minutes. The Cape of Cornwall lies under 50 degrees 25 minut.
Here follows the Card N. 18.
CHAPTER XVI. A TRVE DESCRIPTION of the Seacoasts of England, that lie
between the Sorlinges and Portland.
I. The situation of the Sorlinges, and from Englands end to Lezard.
FRom the point of Cornwall, or the Island of Bresam to Englands end it is
south and north five leagues. From Englands end there lie some rocks, A Rode
behind the rocks at Englands end.
which shoot off from it, where you may anckor behind them at 8 and 9
fathom: you may sail behind them when you come either north or south, on the
south side it is narrow, but deep enough, at least 10 fathom, but out of the
north it is best to come in between them, there it is 8 and 9 fathom deep.
But there lies a rock under the water on the left hand, close by the
north-point of Englands end, which you must shun.

The Sorrels The Sorrels.
or Sorlinges are distant from Englands end w. s. w. and leagues. Between
them both lie Sevenstones Sevenstones.
w. s. w. and w. and by s. from Englands end distant four leagues. It is a
row of rocks whereon it always rayles, and are not above the water.
Sevenstones is distant from Sorlinges n. e. and by e. and e. n. e. three
leagues.

Three or four leagues from Englands end s. s. w. and s. w. and by s. there
lies a sharp rock in the Sea, which at half flood is above the water, and is
indifferent fair, it is called the Wolf, The Wolf.
it is distant from Sorlinges east and west 5 leagues.

To sail into the Sorlinges Islands, when you come out of the east, ^o sail
into Sorrels.
you must sail in by the east-land at 8 or 9 fathom, there lies a sconce
right without the castle, from thence also there shoots off a stone under the
water, you may sail thorough between the said stone and the sconce. To shun
the stone also that lies in the haven, you must understand, that there lie two
rocks on the west side within the haven, one greater then the other, keep the
greatest over against the smalest, and sail nearest to the north-side, and
hold them so, and then you run wide enough without the point at 10 fathom,
but nearer you may not go unto it.

If you will go southward into the Sorrels, To sail out of the south into the
Sorrels.
you must look well before you, because of the stone that lies in the haven,
you may well sail about on both sides, but the east side is the best and
fairest. But to go into the best of the chanel, and to go as near unto the
rock as well you may, then hold the two rocks aforesaid (which lie on the
west side of the haven) the smallest under the greatest, nearest unto the
north-side, as I said before, and so sail about the point, and turn up
northward, until you may see the towreful in the middle of the sandy bay,
there anckor at 7 or 8 fathom, you may hold the said two rocks, (which are
within the haven on the west side) a little distant one from the other, so that
you may see just between the^, then you are right north or east from the rock
which lies in the haven, and then you must run in so by the east-land, then
the said rock will be on the west side, but on the innermost point of the
Island, against the Pale there lies a rock under the water, which you must
shun, and then run up northward, until you may see the tower in the sandy
Baye, as I said before.

The Sorrels on the west side are all full of rocks, and have many channels to
come in, but the south-chanel or haven is best.

When you come to the Sorlinges on the south side then you see a flat steeple
in the Sandbaye or valley, and west it is al full of Islands and rocks, the
ground is stony with some read shells, you may see the south-land at 52
fathom.

Englands end has two round hills, To know^ Englands end.
and on the highest there stands a speere steeple, and when you go somewhat
nearer, you discover also upon the uttermost end another speere steeple or
tower, in the low land, so that the end of England is well to be known, the
ground is whitish sand, mingled with red sand and shelles.

From Sorrels to Lezard it is east and west 16 or 17 leagues. But from Englands
end to Lezard it is e. s. e. 10 or 11 leagues. Monsbaye lies there between
both, and between Monsbaye Eygent^ijck beworp naet leven van all Haven^n,

map of the southern coast of England and the Sorrels lies the rock called the
Wolf, whereof I spoke before, The Wolf.
it lies east from Sorrels 5 leagues, and from the Wolf to Monsbaye it is 8
leagues.

To sail into Mo^sbaye.
If you will enter into Monsbaye coming from Englands end, or from Lezard you
must run upon a castle which stands upon a high round rock; until you come
within half a league near unto it, then you shall turn up west, and sail to
the Baye, until you see the Island on the west side, whereon the two stumpes
stand like beakons, leave that on the left hand, and sail close along by it,
for there it is fair, but leave the castle a great way on the right hand, for
there it is foul. When you come within the Island or rock, then you shall see a
great Sandbaye there behind it, where you may anckor under at 7 or 8 fathom,
there you may lie safe against a s. s. e. wind, but a s. e. and specially an
e. s. e. wind blows open into it, otherwise you lie safe there against all
other winds.

From Monsbaye to Lezard the course is s. e. and n. w. five leagues: The
north-side is all full of rocks to Lezard. From Lezard also there lie some
rocks. And east from Monsbaye there lie rocks a league into the Sea, in dark
gloemie wether a man must be careful to take heed of them.

To know Lezard, it is a small low point, To know Lezard.
and on the south-ende there stands a steeple, and on high toward the
north-ende there stands a sharp steeple, you may see Lezard at 55 fathom,
the ground is white and read shellie sand.

II. To sail into the Havens and Rodes that lie between Lezard and Ramshead,
the west-point of the Haven of Plimmouth.
FRom Lezard to Famouth south and north 4 leagues.

Hi^^ord h^^^n.
B^tweene Famouth and Lezard lies Hilford, where you may run in through the
middle of the haven, between a sloping and a low point, on the south side
lies the sloping point, and on the north-side the sharp point, it is a short
haven to sail into, and within the haven on the south side there stands a
G^ntlemans house, below upon the strand, and on high there stands a company
of trees, which you place one over against the other when you run into the
haven. On the north-side also there stand two or three trees, which come a
masts length westward from a house, which stands in a white sand-baye, sail
so in the middle of the haven, and anckor at 6 or 7 fathom. On the south side
there stands a sharp steeple upon the high land, and on the north-side there
stands a castle upon the shoring land, To s^^le (...) a^^^th.
this is in the haven, wherein few ships enter for fear of danger.

To sail into Famouth, you shall first see a castle on the high land, on the
west side of the haven, then run along in within two cables length by the
east-land, there lie rocks upon the inner side of the east-point of Famouth,
you must go in close by them, and then sail upon the high land, which lies
on the west-s d^. Behind in the haven there stands a white chalk piece of
ground, and there also you see a box tree, you must hold it ov^r against the
north-point of the high west-land, and so sail to the high land, until you
come to it, and you shall not have less water at half flood then 5 fathom,
and that is between the east and west castles, or a little within them, and you
may also when you come within the west castle sail forward, to the middle of
the high land, which you see on the west side of the haven, and at the
north-side of the high land you may anckor at 12, 13 and 14 fathom.

You may also strike over to the east-land, and anckor under the banck which
comes running off from the east-castle in the middle along the haven, at 6, 7
and 8 fathom. This banck at low water is almost dry, and it is soft moorish
ground, so that you lie fast in the dirt when you fall on ground there.

You may also run about west from the stone which lies in the haven, t^en
you must hold the west-land side whereon the castle stands, at 5 or 6
fathom, for it is no deeper then 6 or 7 fathom at half flood, but on the
east side of the stone it is 7 or 8 fathom deep. Four leagues upward from
Famouth lies a town called Traeren.

Two leagues east from Famouth lies the point of the Deadmanshead, The
Deadmanshead.
which is a round hill, which toward the west goes slope down, it is double
land, and there westward there stands a mill at the end of a sharp steeple,
there also stand some houses upon the land, and a little westward you may see
the castle of Famouth, upon a round hillock, against that high land, it is well
to be known for such as come out of the west from Lezard.

From the Deadmanshead to Fawick it is northeast 4 leagues. Fawick.


Fawick lies in a great Creek, it is a Tyde-haven, where a ship may enter
at half flood, on the east side of the haven there stands a little church,
with a steeple, and on the west side there stands a white church with a
flat steeple, at the west-ende being somewhat greater then the church upon
the east-ende.

If you will sail into Fawick you must stay till half flood, and so sail in
the middle of the chanel, between the east and west points, and when you are
within the point, then you may choose what side you will, yet there is most
water by the west side, between the stakes and the steeple that stands upon
the west side.

But if you go in by the west side, then you must presently turn off when you
are within the stakes, and sail almost in the middle of the haven, nearest to
the west side, to the town that lies on the west side of the haven, there is
a deep pit, where a man may lie with a ship of sixteen foot deep aflote
at a low water.

You may also sail further in, until you see a wall on the west side of the
haven, and behind it there stands a village: a ships length southward from
the wall it is good lying fastened with four ropes, for there you lie close by
the east side.

You may also sail in further to a hollow place that lies on the west side,
wherein a water-mill stands, but go not to near the north-point thereof,
for there lies a rock under the water, and when you are somewhat past it, then
you may towe the ship in the middle of the water, for there it is best lying
for ships that draw much water: but south from the aforesaid wall a ship
of 16 foot may lie aflote.

Right within the east-point of the haven of Fawick there lies a village, and
right before the village there is a deep poole, where you may go in with
three or four ships, and the depth goes right within the east-point.

But if you go in by the east-point, and will lie in the said poole, you must
sail within the stakes, and put somewhat off from the east-land, that you may
go nearest to the west-land, for on the eastland there reaches a flat along
the haven, which begins right against the first house of the westerlyest
village, and if it so fall out, that you can not get in there, then let your
anckor fall without the stakes, and make your ship fast with ropes within,
for that a ship which draws sixteen foot water may lie aflote within the
stakes at a dead stream.

Ramshead
From Fawick to Ramshead (the west-point of the haven of Plimmouth) it is
westsouthwest, and eastnortheast 6 leagues.

Between them there lies an Island called Low, where you may anckor under it,
at 5 or 6 fathom, you may go both on the east and west side, but the
east side is wydest and best to go in.

Thus Lezard shows when you sail along by it.
view of Lizard Thus the land shows between Lezard and Deadmanshead.

Lezard. Famouth. Deadmanshead.

view of Lizard

III. How to sail into Plimmouth, and from thence into Goutstart
Rode under Ramshead.
NOrth from Ramshead, close under the land, a man may anckor in a sandbaye, at
8, 9, and 10 fathom, for there it is fair.

From Ramshead to the Meustone or Idestone it is south 3 leagues.

Idestone lies from the point of Plimmouth s. and by w. and southsouthwest 4
leagues.

The haven of Plimmouth reaches in n. n. e. If you will go into Catte-water,
you must go in between the eastpoint and the Island, upon the point of
Plimmouth, so long till you see Catte-water open, and then run in between
the point of Plimmouth and the east-point to the north-land, and anckor before
the steep shoring land, at 4 or 5 fathom at a low water because of the
continual tide.

There lies a stone under the water westward from the Ila^d, which at a low
water has but 3 fathom water upon it.

If you will go behind the Island, east or west from the said stone, which
lies within the Island, as I said before, then run to the Island, till you be
at five fathom at a low water, until the Fishermens village comes on the
west side of the valley, then you are west from the stone, and you must go
through between the Island and the stone, and when the fishermens village which
stands behind the wall, is in the northside of the valley, then you go east
from the stone.

But if you will sail over the stone, then you must hold the steeple of the
fishermens village over the north-side of the valley, and sail to the land of
Plimmouth, until the wall standing on the land of Plimmouth shows endelong
to you, and so long till Catte-water comes open to you, then you may well
sail behind the Ila^d into Westcomfer, or anckor behind the Island at 12 or
13 fathom, and then you are past over the stone, at three fathom and an half,
at lowest water.

And coming before Westcomfer in the narrow way, then you must go through
the middle of the water right in, and then strike up on the left hand, and
anckor at 15 or 16 fathom. In the narrow it is 15, 16, and 17 fathom, and
also 20 fathom deep, and behind the Island 8, 9, 10, and 12 fathom.

In the haven of Plimmouth there lie two or three blind rocks, at three
fathom and a half at low water, the marks thereof are these, there stands
a steeple and a mill east from Plimmouth, and west from the Island there
stands a gentleman's house, when the tower of the house comes over against
the point which lies against the Island, and the steeple and the mill east from
Plimmouth are one over against the other, the^ you are upon the innermost
stone, which at low water is 4 fathom deep.

When the west-point of Westcomfer comes on the point which lies west from
the Island, then you are upon the uttermost stone, and there it is 3 fathom and
an half deep, with low water and a spring-tyde.

Upon the eastpoint of Plimmouth haven there lies a rock very round and high,
which by the Englishmen is called Meustone, but by the Dutch sailors Cocxbroot,
because it is so round. From that stone or rock 7 leagues e. s. e. lies
Goutstart, under the point of Goutstart you may anckor safe against a northwest
wind.

Thus the high land on the east side of Plymmouth shows.
view of Plymouth Thus Goudstart shows it self when it is seven leagues north
from you.
view of 'Goudstart' (town in England)

IIII. The situation of the land between Goutstart and Portland.
Rode under Goutstart.
Under the point of Goutstart on the east side you may anckor safe against a n.
w. wind, at 10 or 11 fathom, between the church which stands upon the high
land and the point of Goutstart, so that the point may lie s.w. from you.

West from Goutstart there lies a haven called Salcem, but from Goutstart to
Dartmouth it is northeast 3 leagues.

Dartmouth lies in between two high lands, and on each side of the haven
there lies a castle, Dartmouth.
it is a narrow haven, so that in time of war there was wont to be a chain
laid cross over the haven, and on the west side there stands a church upon
the high land.

To sail into Dartmouth.
To sail into Dartmouth when you come out of the west, you must sail so long
about east, or along by the west side until the Kaye of the village, (which
lies on the east side of the haven) comes in the middle of the chanel, then
sail up upon it, in the middle between both the lands, and be ready with
your boat, if the wind should chance to whirle, that then you might towe in,
and then turn on the west side before the brewhouse and anckor at 10 or 12
fathom, for within it is a wide haven, and you may as well anckor before the
village as before the brewhouse. There lies a blind rock on the east side of
the haven of Dartmouth, the marks to sail out of the danger thereof are
these, there is a red point east from Dartmouth, which upon the water is
black, and in the red there lies a white stone, when the white stone is over
against the black point, then you are right over against the said rock, which
lies before the haven of Dartmouth, but when you see the Kaye of the village
then do as aforesaid, and you shall not sail by the stone.

Four leagues east from Dartmouth lies the baye of Torbaye, Torbaye Rode.
where you may anckor, you must place the west-point s.e. and s. s. e. from
you, and there you lie safe against a southwest wind at 7 or 8 fathom.

On the east side there is also a Tyde-haven, where there is good anckor
ground, at 4 or 5 fathom, as you are close by or far from the land.

From Torbaye to Portland it is east, and east and by north 13 leagues. About 5
leagues n. and n. and by e. from Torbaye lyeah the creek of Tops or Exmouth,
Exmouth.
where you may lie safe against a south-winde, at 7 or 8 fathom, good anckor
ground, on the south side of the Single which lies before the tyde-haven of
Exmouth, so that the rocks of Totmanstone lie south, and south and by east
from you.

From Exmouth to Portland the course is e. s. e. 13 leagues.

Between them both, close by the land there lies an Island called Cob.

Thus the land shows between Goutstart and Torbaye.
view of England Thus the land on the west side of Portland shows when you
sail along by it.
view of Portland Thus Portland shows when you come from the west.
view of Portland Thus Portland shows when it is north and by west from you
seven leagues.
view of Portland Thus Portland shows when you come from the east.
view of Portland

As long as Portland lies west and by north from you, then the east point is
high and steep, but when it begins to come northnortheast from you, then it
lies as it were round to your sight, and when it lies more easterly from you,
then the westside is the highest and steepest.

V. Of many depths and fashions of grounds which men find when they come out
of the Sea, to seek out the chanel between Heysant and the Sorrels, taken out
of the search made by Adrian Gerritson of Haerlem.
SOuthwest and by south from Seims seven leagues it is 72 fathom deep, The
Seims
and the ground is slopie white great sand, as if it were wreathed small
stones, with small pieces of shelles, graye flat stones, and white shining
needles, sail from thence n. and n. and by e. then you are in a good way to
Heysant.

The Seims
About 2 leagues s. w. from Seimes it is 52 fathom deep, and the ground is
there white yellowe, with some small read shelles, many graie ragged needles,
and with some white shining points, as if they were needles. If a man found 70
or 80 fathom there, they would judge it to be good chanel ground, for it is
white yellowe rough long sand.

The Seims
Also w. s. w. from the Seimes, so far from the land that you may see the
Sheets from the poope of the ship very well, there it is 54. fathom deep,
the ground there is red white yellowe, and black pieces as if it were parings
of cheese, with some great read sand amongst it.

West and by south 8 or 9 leagues from Seims at 65 fathom there the ground is
white yellowe, and some small read shellie sand, with some pieces of shelles,
which are not over great, and with much white-yellowe long sand, with small
white points of needles, such as men cast in the channels.

He^s^nt.
Seven leagues s. w. from Heysant, or thereaboutes, where you may plainly see
from the poope of the ship at 70 fathom, there the ground is white yellowe
great sand, with some pieces of crampen, some pieces of white thin shelles,
and some graye flat hackled stones.

Southwest and by west from Heysant about 19 or 20 leagues, at 78 or 80
fathom, the ground is white yellowe great sand with shining needles, white
pieces of crampen, graye yellowe flat stones, and pieces, as if they were of
oyster shelles.

West and by south from Heysant 21 leagues, at 86 fathom, there the ground is
read yellowe and black, with a little white round sand amongst it, showing as
if it were shel-sand. But at 80 fathom, 21 leagues west from Heysant the
ground is yellowe and shellie, with some graye rugged needles, as if they were
the ends of small rye.

Also at 80 fathom, Heysant.
24 leagues from Heysant w. and by s. the ground is rough sand, with many
pieces of red white yellowe and graye shelles, and pieces of crampen or
shelles.

From Heysant west 16 or 17 leagues, at 75 fathom, the ground is pale yellowe
great sand, with pieces of white thin shelles, and graye pieces of crampen,
or of oyster shelles, and white shining needles.

Eight or 9 leagues from Heysant it is 70 fathom deep, the ground is read
yellowe white and graye shellie sand, with read yellowe and black pieces of
shelles, and small read yellowe black graye little stones, and some white
needles.

Fortie-eight Leagues w. and by n. from Heysant, and w. s. w. from Lezard 50
leagues, or thereaboutes, it is 95 fathom deep, the ground is read yellowe
and black sand, with small white round shellie sand, some small pieces of
shelles or crampen, and some small pieces of thin shelles.

Thirty three leagues w. and by n. from Heysant, and 28 leagues s. w. and by
s. from Sorrels at 95 fathom, there the ground is graye, read yellowe with
black sand amongst it, and some dark read pieces, and pale yellowe pieces of
shelles, to conclude it is there small graye read shellie sand, and the best
course from this ground is e. n. e. it is almost under the height of
nine-and-fortie degrees.

Four-and-twentie leagues w. or w. and by n. from Heysant, and s. and by w.
from the Sorrels 21 leagues, at 80 fathom, there the ground is white, graye,
read yellowe small shellie sand, with small read and white pieces of shelles,
and to see to, it is like ground mustard seed, it is under the height of 49
degrees.

Seven or 8 leagues west, and w. and by n. from Heysant at 68 or 70 fathom,
the ground is white yellowe small shel-sand, with many graye curld needles
amongst it.

About 31 leagues west, and somewhat northerlyer from Heysant at 90 fathom,
there the ground is small white rough long sand, mixed with a little read and
yellowe, and with some shining needles, with two or three pieces of white graye
shelles, and when you go there n. e. and by n. till you be under 55 fathom,
the ground is yellowe and white great shellie sand, with white pieces of
shelles, then you may see the Sorrels 9 or 10 league^ northward, or somewhat
westerlyer from you.

Westnorthwest from Heysant 21 leagues, and s. w. and by s. from Lezard 28
leagues, Heysant.
at 80 fathom, there the ground is gray read shel sand, and upon the lead
there comes a piece of white or graye crampen or shelles, with read and
yellowe pieces of shelles, and many pieces of needles.

Nine leagues n. w. and by n. from Heysant the ground is white yellowe rugged
shellie sand, with graye short needles, and shyning needles, there also sticks
on the lead things like strawes, when you go n. e. from thence then you sail
upon Goutstart.

Twenty leagues n. w. and by n. from Heysant, and 16 leagues s. w. and
somewhat southerlyer from Lezard at 68 fathom, there the ground is white
yellowe read small round sand, with some white shyning needles, and a graye
short needle or two, and two or three pieces of white shelles.

Nineteen leagues n. n. w. from Heysant, and 12 or 13 leagues s. s. w. from
Lezard it is 68 fathom deep, the ground is there of all kind of hackled
stones, graye, read, and black, with read pieces of shelles, and some graye
hackled needles.

Nineteen leagues n. and by w. from Heysant, and southward from Lezard, there
it is 62 fathom, there the ground is white, shellie sand, with white needles
and graye needles, and white pieces of shelles, and two or three read stones
amongst it.

Sorrels.
Twelve or therteene leagues about west from Sorrels, or somewhat northerly,
there it is 60 fathom deep, and the ground is graye oasie ground, with small
black sand mixed among it, and in some places at the same depth, it is white
graye oasie small sand, with pieces of thin white shelles among it, with a
piece or two like parings of cheese, and this ground you cannot get upon the
lead with tallowe, for it will not stick upon it, unless you put butter or
grease under the bottom of the lead, and in no place else you have this ground
at this depth, so oasie as there, and therefore you must certainly know, that
there you are behind the Sorrels, or behind England, that is west from
Sorrels.

West from Sorrels seven leagues, there also it is oasie ground graye sand,
with two or three pieces of cheese parings.

Lezard.
Seven or eight leagues southsouthwest from Lezard at 60 fathom, there the
ground is white great sand, with a little read, and white shelles, and shyning
white needles.

Ten or eleven leagues southwest from Lezard at 60 fathom, there the ground
is yellowe pieces of shelles, and graye pieces of soft flat stones, as if
they were parings of cheese, and some read pieces of shelles, without any
sand therein.

Southwest and by west from Lezard, and southsouthwest from Sorrels 19 leagues,
there it is deep 78 fathom, there the ground is graye yellowe read shellie
ground, with read yellowe and blewe pieces of shelles and crampen, and a piece
or two as if it were cheese parings, or pieces of oyster shelles, and two or
three shining needles, at the height of about 49 degrees 30 minutes.

Fiveteene or sixteen leagues southwest and by south from Goutstart at 57 or
58 fathom, Goutstart.
there the ground is all manner of pieces of shelles, and crampen, with a little
white yellowe shellie sand, and all manner of stones, graye pieces like parings
of cheese, some rough needles, shyning needles, and things like as if they were
carnels or measels that are in bakon.

Southwest from Goutstart 16 leagues, at 53 fathom, the ground is white redish
shellie sand, with pieces of crampen, and read and graye stones.

Southsouthwest 11 or 13 leagues from Goutstart at 50 fathom, the ground is
white yellowe small shellie sand, with some pieces of white shelles, and graye
ragged, and shyning needles. To conclude he that sounds much, finds many
sorts of Ground, and sometimes much alteration, in small changing of places.
But he that finds depth with white shelles and little needles, he must
understand that he is nearest to Heysant. But if he find brannie ground, or
black stones mingled with white measels or carnels, then he is nearest to the
Sorlinges.

The tokens or signs of Heysant depth, Marks of Heysant and Sorrels.
you shall find small white sand and shelles, and small things, it being oasie
and white, then Heysant lies n. e. from you, and if you find all along things
like needles, then Heysant lies southeast from you, but if you be not sure of
these grounds, then you must go northwards, and if you find it deeper, then
you are toward the Seims, and if it be dryer then you are in the chanel
northward from Heysant. If you are between Heysant and the Seims at 70
fathom, then the ground will be stones, like black earth sand. And if you find
the ground great read sand, then you must go northward, until you find
white sand ground, and long carnels or measels, then you must know that you
enter into the chanel.

CHAPTER XVII. A TRVE DESCRIPTION how you may sail into the Havens between
Portland and the Foreland.
I. To sail by the Ras of Portland, and into the Haven of Poole.
THe Ras of Portland begins about half way from Portland, The Ras of
Portland.
and ends against the middle of S. Andrews land, in some places it is all
banckie, and sometimes it is deeepe 7, and then 10, and then 15 fathom;

Rode in Portland.
If you come from the west and desire to go into Portland, you may run along
within two cables length, or the shot of a piece by Portland, and sail
westward about the point up before the castle, where you may lie safe against a
south, and a south and by east wind, at 7 or 8 fathom, but with a southwest,
and a southsouthwest wind, a man must take heed of the ravelings, which begin
half way from Portland, and end half way at S. Andrews land.

About a great league north from Portland there lies a little Tydehaven, which
at low water is dry, it is called Weimouth, before it you may anckor at 4 or
5 fathom.

Men commonly anckor under Portland at 10 or 11 fathom, that the point may be
south and by east, and southsoutheast from you.

To sail into the haven of Poole.
By the east-point of S. Andrews land, three leagues west from the Needles of
the I Will of Wight, you run into the haven of Poole, which is a good haven for
ships that will go about eastward. To go into it go along by S. Andrews
land, at 5 or 6 fathom with half flood, but when you come against the Cingle
or the other land, then loose westward to the point, and there anckor, for
there you lie safe against a s. w. and s. s. w. wind. But if you will sail
into the haven of Poole, then shall you perceive another point bearing out, so
soon as you are gone about the foresaid point, by the which stands a high
white steep rock like a mast, almost like the Needle on the west end of
Wight, there you may sail about at 4 or 5 fathom. Now when you are about the
said point with the needle go forward northwest, and you shall see right
before you a high flat hill rising up out of the other land, keep that hill
between both the shores, and sail right forward. But if it chance that you
must laveere, then spare not your lead, and run no further westward as you
cross, then that the foresaid flat hill comes upon the west-land: for so
soon as the hill begins to come upon the west-land, you must turn, or else
you shall presently be on ground: when you be turned, then cross no further
eastward then that the foresaid rock comes upon the east-downe, which is a
high, graye, sharp down, lying upon the east side: if you hold these marks
so, then you have water enough at half flood. Where it is shallowest, at low
water there is in the chanel 10 or 11 foot water, yet it flows but five foot
up and down. A southeast and northwest moon makes high water there: but it
flows twice in a tide: for a south and by east moon makes there also full
Sea, and that comes by reason of the fore-ebbe which falls out of Wight.
When you are within the chanel, then go on northeast, and keep the beakons
which stand on the east-land on starreborde, and go up reasonable close. The
shores on both sides are very steep, and the chanel is not wide, but without
the deep or chanel it is very flat. It is Pilots water.

When you be by Portland then S. Andrews land thus, when you sail along by
it.

Portland.

view of Portland

II. To sail into the Havens of the I Will of Wight.
FRom Portland to the west-ende of the I Will of Wight it is 11 leagues e. n. e.
but to Wolfertshorne it is 13 leagues east and by north and west and by south.

To sail into the west-ende of the I Will of Wight.
To sail into the west-ende of the I Will of Wight, you must sail right upon the
Needle of the I Will of Wight, running in close along by the Needle, within a
cables length thereof, because of the sands which lie of from the Cingle,
before the west-ende of the I Will of Wight, whereby the chanel or haven is not al
to wide, and when you are within the Needle, you must turn over to the castle
which stands upon the Cingle, because there lie some rocks upon the Island
under the water, it is between the Needle and the banck five fathom deep,
with low water.

Marks of the haven of the Needle.
The marks to sail right into the Haven of the Needle are these, when you hold
the inner point of the Island without the Needle, or the castle which stands
upon the Cingle without the Needle, and so run till you be within the
banckes, being there within, you must put of somewhat to the Cingle, and when
you are within the Cingle, then leave two third-parts of the water on the left
hand, and so sail before the village of Newton, and there anckor at 9 or 10
fathom. But if you will sail further to Calveroot, you must sail so long
until Southhampton comes without the point, there is the best Rode, and the
best lying in all the Havens of the I Will of Wight, at 10 or 12 fathom.

To sail into the east-ende of the I Will of Wight.
To sail into the east-ende of the I Will of Wight, then you must set the
easterly castle over the Lime-kil (which is a white place in the land, lying
beneath the castle) which you hold standing so, until the Swan-cliffe comes
within or under the point of the I Will of Wight, then you must bring the
Lime-kill over against the east-ende of Porchmouth, which you must hold in that
sort, until the castle that stands west from Porchmouth comes upon the
wood. These marks standing thus, you shall sail neither by flattes nor sands,
and you come sometimes about S. Helens church, and when the castle of the I Will
of Wight comes without the Swan-cliffe, and S. Ellens church two ships
length within the redde-point, then you sail not by the sand.

And if it fall out that you cannot see the Lime-kill, Marks not to sail by
the Sand.
then you must hold the castle west from the Swan-cliffe, until S. Ellens
church comes a ships length without the point of the Island, then you may
freely go northwest without sailing by the sand, then you must set the
apiece steeple between the east-ende of Porchmouth and the castle, but
when the castle on the west side of Porchmouth comes upon the east side of
the wood, then you sail neither by flattes nor sands, as I said before.

When the easterly white place is a ships length westward from the wood,
which stands west from the castle, Other marks.
then you are east from the sand.

And when the Swan-cliffe is within the point, then also you are within the
cliffe.

The marks of the Flat are these, there stands a apiece steeple in the
land, Marks of the Flat.
and a castle upon the water eastward from Porchmouth, against the castle there
stands a white place called the Lime-kill, as I said before, when that is
east from the said castle, so that you may see just between them, then you are
upon the Flat, which at low water is 10 foot deep, and then the castle west
from Porchmouth, stands on the west side of the wood.

But when the apiece steeple on the west side comes to the foot of the
castle, then the castle west from Porchmouth, stands on the west side of the
wood, and there at low water it is 12 foot deep upon the Fat. And when the
apiece steeple, stands between the east-ende of Porchmouth and the
castle right between the lime-kill and the steeple, and the castle west from
Porchmouth at the west-ende of the wood, there it is 11 fathom deep at high
water.

And when the lime-kill stands against the tower of Porchmouth, and the
castle on the west-ende of the wood, then you have 10 fathom deep at high
water.

When S. Ellens church lies southwest and by west from you then the
southeast-ende of the Flat lies northeast and by north from you, and the
west-ende north and by east.

Thus the Island of Wight shows when you sail along by it, being three or
four leagues of from it.
view of the Isle of Wight

III. To sail from the I Will of Wight to Bevesier.
FRom Wight to the east-ende of Wembridge at twelve fathom the course is
eastnortheast 6 or 7 leagues, Wembridge.
and from Wembridge to Bevesier east and by north, and somewhat easterlyer 13
leagues.

You may sound Wembridge at 12 fathom, cross over in the land there stands
a steeple against Wembridge, when that is northnorthwest from you, then you are
against Wembridge: and when Swan-cliffe is w. and by n. and w. n. w. from you,
the^ you are without Wembridge: if you be acquainted with the place, you may
sail through between the land and Wembride.

Between Wembridge and Porchmouth there runs in a great Haven, whereon
there lies a town called Chychester, which by some is placed upon the River
of New Haven, which is otherwise.

Arundel.
From Wembridge to Arundel, it is eastnortheast 5 leagues. This is a deep
Tyde-haven, where at half flood a great ship may well go in, you go along
by the west-land, northeast, and in the mouth of the haven you have 2 fathom,
between both the lands 3, and within the haven 4 and 5 fathom at low water,
where you anckor before the village.

In this Haven the Englishmen build many ships, because within the River
there is much timber.

Eight leagues east from Arundel lies the River of Newerhave^, Newerhaven.
where there runs in two channels, the one west, the other east: that on the
west side goes in close by the west-land, and is two fathom deep at low
water.

The east-chanel goes in along by the Cingle, and is three fathom deep. In
the same men lie at rode west from Bevesier, for it is a good have^, wide and
broad, and is 4 or 5 fathom deep within at low water. But on the east side,
within in the same haven there lies a blind rock, which you must shun. At
this haven of Newer-haven begin the Seven-cliffes, which reach to Bevesier.
Under Bevesier against the west-ende of the Seven-cliffes you may anckor right
against the Cingle, whereby you ru^ne along into Newer-haven, at 7, 8, or 9
fathom, you may also anckor on the east side of Bevesier at 6, 7 or 8 fathom,
then the point shall be south, and south and by west from you.

Bevesier is the best known land in the whole chanel along, and you may see the
land without Bevesier, against the Seven-cliffes or Kenning-land at 23 or 30
fathom.

Thus the land of Bevesier shows with the Seven-cliffes
view of England

IIII. To sail from Bevesier to Dover, and then to the Foreland.
FRom Bevesier to the point of the Cingle it is eastnortheast 8 leagues.

To sail into the Chamber.
He that will sail into the Chamber coming out of the west, he must keep
Bevesier without the point of Fierley, and run so on upon the Cingle, and
then along by the Cingle within two cables length, to the end of the Cingle,
then you must turn up westward, leaving the beakons on the right hand, til you
be before the castle which stands upon the South-Cingle, there you may anckor
in the River of Rye, at four and five fathom, when you sail up, you must
leave the beakons on starreborde, (as is said before) for the beakons stand
upon the darisen, and at low water they are dry, along to the town of Rye,
and it is all beakoned along.

On the east side of the Cingle, you may also anckor in Rumney-baye,
Rumney-baye.
before Rumney tower, running in so far that the point of the Cingle, be
south, and south and by west from you, there it is seven and eight fathom
deep, there you may anckor.

From the Cingle aforesaid to the north-point of Dover it is northeast and by
east 9 leagues.

Before Dover you may anckor safe against a north, Rode under Dover.
and a northwest wind, right against the castle is the best anckoring at 10
fathom, for there it is fair ground.

To sail into the Downs, sail easily in by the point of Dover, all along by
the land, within two cables length, To sail into the Downs.
and set beneath the middle castle, at seven or eight fathom.

To sail through between Goodwin and the land.
When you come out of the west and will go in between Goodwin-sands to the
Foreland, you must go n. and by e. so long until that the mill which stands
upon the Foreland, come on the west side of the valley, which is in the
Foreland, going all along north and by east, and northnortheast, until the
tower which is upon the Foreland comes upon the east-ende of the valley, then
you are north from the Quernes, then the flat steeple which stands upon the
land of Dover will be upon or right over the third white chalck hill which
lies north from the point of Dover, this is a right long mark to sail
through between the Quernes and Goodwin-sands, as well from the east as from
the west.

To sail north within Goodwin sands.
If you will go north within Goodwin sands, you must go no nearer to the
Quernes then seven fathom, placing the point of Dover southsouthwest from you,
and there you go in at the best depth, the^ when the flat steeple which
stands upon the Foreland comes within Ramsgate or the valley, then you are
against the Quernes, Marks of the Qu^rnes.
and when the mill comes within Ramsgate then you are south from the Quernes.

When you lie in the Downs, and that the inner point of Dover cl^ffe is
southsouthwest from you, then the Quernes lie north and by east from you, and
the north-ende of Goodwinsands lies northeast from you.

The aforesaid north-ende of Goodwin sands, lies s. e. and by east from the
Foreland, a great league, the Quernes lie along Thus the land of Dover opens
when you are went from Woman or Vrowen-sand through the Heads.
view of Dover by the Foreland toward the Downs.

When you will sail without Goodwin sands to the Foreland, then hold the point
which lies west from Dover, To sail without Goodwin sands to the Foreland.
without the point of the downs, and go in north-east, till the Foreland be
northwest and by west from you, then you may well go to the Foreland and
anckor before Margat, or where you will, but right against the steeple which
has the mill by it, is the best rode: or when the point of the Foreland is
southsouthwest, and southwest and by south from you, there also is good
anckoring at 8 or 9 fathom.

You may also go between the Quernes and the Foreland, To go within the
Quernes to Sandwich.
to Sandwich, but there lies an other Sand, called the Three-stales, between
it and the Quernes, it is 3 fathom deep, and between the land and the said
sand it is also 3 fathom deep at half flood, but the Quernes are in short
time much lessened, and clean gone, so that the north end is almost gone.

Between Margat and the Reculvers you may anckor in all places at 6 or 7
fathom at half flood.

Thus Fierley shows when you sail along by it four leagues from the land.

When you go from the Downs to the Foreland, then the land shows thus.

V. Of the running and falling of the streams in these places.
FRom Portland to the I Will of Wight the flood falls east and by north, and the
ebb west and by south.

From the I Will of Wight to Bevesier likewise east and by north, and west and by
south.

By Bevesier on the land before the Seven-cliffes, the flood falls east and
by south, and the ebb west and by north.

From Bevesier to the Single it falls eastnortheast, and westsouthwest.

From the Singles to Dover the flood falls northeast and by east, and
southwest and by west.

In the middle through the Heads the flood falls northeast and by east, and
the ebb southwest and by south.

From Dover to the Foreland the stream falls within Goodwin-sands through
over the Quernes south and north, and by the Foreland in to the Reculvers, over
the Brakes the flood falls westsouthwest, and west and by south.

About without Goodwin to Kintesknock, the flood falls north and by west and
northnorthwest, there the flood comes both from north and south, and meet
each other, and fall so in to the sands, and the havens or channels.

In the chanel without the Flemish Banckes, it is 23 and 24 fathom deep, but
close by Goodwin sands it is 28 and 29 fathom deep, and then you are not two
pieces shot from them, therefore he that sayleth out of the Marsdeepe to the
Heads, he must not go otherwise then southwest, and southwest and by south,
and he must also stay much upon the stream, for in this place it is very fit
and necessary to be done, and when you guess that you have sailed 40 or 45
leagues, then choose the Flemish Banckes at 20 and 18 fathom, and when you are
sure of the ground, then go southwest, and at last southwest and by west, then
you shall come into the middle of the Heads.

VI. What Moon in these places makes high water.
AGainst the I Will of Wight before Wolvertshorn a south and by east moon makes
a full Sea.
At Hampton at the Kaye a south and a north moon.
Within the Needles of the I Will of Wight a southeast and by south moon.
At S. Ellens and Calveroort a southsoutheast moon.
At Bevesier on the land a south and north moon.
Without in the chanel a s. s. w. moon.
In the chanel of Winchelsey a south and by east moon.
Against the Cingle a southsouthwest moon.
Between Dover and the Cingle the like.
At Dover a south and north moon makes a full Sea.
In the middle between the Heads a southwest moon makes full Sea.
In the Downs a southsouthwest moon.
On the Foreland a south and north moon.
VII. What depths are about these places.
IN the chanel between Portland and the Casquettes it is 40 fathom deep, and
when it is clear wether, then you may see the land on both sides, and the
nearer you are to England the shallower.

Without or against the I Will of Wight it is 38 fathom deep, and you may see
the land.

Without Bevesier against the Seven-cliffes or Kenningsland it is 28 and 30
fathom deep.

Between Winchelsey and Picardie in the middle of the chanel it is 26 and 27
fathom deep, and you may see Fierley and the land of Dover.

Vrouwen or Woman-sand lies in the middle of the Heads, and at low water it
is but sixteen or seventeene foot deep, but it is narrow, and runs about
south to the land of Bullen. This Sand lies south and by east from Dover, and
from Caliscliffe west and by south. On both sides of this Banck, both on
Picardie and on the English side it is 22, 23, and 24 fathom deep.

VIII. How these places aforesaid lie distant one from the other.

AT AMSTERDAM PRINTED BY WILLIAM JOHNSON, DWELLING upon the Water, by the
Old Bridge, at the Sign of the Golden Son-dyall. Anno 1612.

Here follows the Card N. 20.

CHAPTER I. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Islands and Channels lying between Vlieland
and the Elve.
I. Of the Islands of Vlieland and the Schellingh:
THe Island of the Vlieland is three leagues long, and is well to be known, on
the east end there lie high white ba^ckes or downs; but on the west it is
flat or low land. On the west end there stands a church with a mill east
from it. From the west end thereof there shoots out a Sand a good way in to
the Sea. West Vlieland deep.
West from this rock, between Vlieland and Eyerland there runs in a chanel
called the Wester gat, or West-Vlieland-deepe, but it is not for great ships,
but only for fishermen, for therein there is not above 8 or 10 foot water. At
the east end there stands a mill with a cape, which are marks to shun the
grounds that lie before the Vlie. The east end of the Vlieland, and the west
end of the Tessel are distant from each other 8 leagues.

East from Vlieland lies the Schellingh; which is about three leagues long,
The Schellingh.
upon it there stand four churches and one chapel: the westerlyest is a high
flat steeple called Brandaris; which is well known by all Seafaring men.
About the middle of the land there stand two steeples, the westerlyest is a
statte steeple, called Zeerip, the easterlyest is sharp and is called Midland,
and east from it there stands a high speere steeple called the Horn, and a
chapel called S. John's. On the east end there lie high downs, but not upon
the west end, but one only called the Lit, between Midlands and the Lit it
is low flat land. On the west end there stands three capes or beakons, the
westerlyest is for Bomekins gat, the easterlyest for the north gat or chane,
but the middlemost is for the Slencke, which runs from the New ligger
through Peter's sand into the Sea.

Thus the Island of the Vlieland shows being about two leagues cross from it.
view of Vlieland

Thus the Schellingh shows when you sail along by it about two leagues from
the land.

II. To sail into the channels of the Vlie and first of Stortemelck.
HOw you must sail up and down the Vlie stream, and how you shall sail out
of all the channels of the Vlie stream, it is at large declared in the first
Chapter of the first Book. But how a man shall reach the said channels without,
and sail into them I will here at large truly declare.

To sail into Stortemelck (that is the Land-deepe of Vlieland) set the cape
and the mill upon the eastende one against the other, and sail up upon it, and
so you shall find the uttermost tonne lying at five fathom, the cape and the
mill shall then stand eastsoutheast, and southeast and by east from you. This
uttermost tonne lies nearest to the north side, yet you may well go somewhat
north about it, for the north side is reasonable flat, so that coming out of
the north, you may sound it at five or six fathom, till you be within the
uttermost tonne. The second tonne, The Droghe dry.
called the tonne upon the Droghe dry, lies east, and east and by south from
the uttermost, at four fathom on the north side, the right depth there against
it is also four fathom, with low water. When you sail in you leave that on
the baghborde.

Between this tonne and the uttermost tonne, it is not deeper upon the Droghe
dry or drumpel then 16 foot with low water. From the second tonne to the
third the course is east and by north, that lies on the north-side at five
fathom, but the right depth there against it, is seven fathom, you may sail
in all along by the strand of Flieland to this tonne without misdoing, for it
is all fair. From the third tonne to the fourth or innermost the course is
east and by north, that lies at 3 fathom on the south side, that is, at the
point of the Sand, which comes off from the north-point of the Vlieland. From
the third tonne to this tonne you must leave the foot-strand of Vlieland,
because of the said Sand, and run north about by the tonne. It is there in
the chanel 4 fathom deep at low water. From thence forward to the tonne upon
the Flat the course is southsoutheast, or sail forward by the foot-strand of
the Vlieland to Langesand, for that is all very fair, there in the chanel it
is five six and seven fathom deep.

III. The situation of Boemkens haven.
BOemkens gat is now at this time, the best chanel of all the channels of the
Vlie. If you will sail into Bomekens gat, coming out of the Sea, then set the
westerlyest cape on the Schelling against the steeple of Brandaris, and then
they will stand about southeast from you, then sail upon them, and so you shall
find the uttermost tonne at ten fathom, which lies at the end of Boemkens
ground. Boemkens ground shoots off with a long small sand, to that uttermost
tonne, and are both without and within very uneven and sloping, a little south
or west from the tonne you shall be close by it at 12 fathom, so that at one
cast with the lead you shall have 12 fathom, the second but 8 or 7, and the
third 3 or 4 fathom, with flat bottomed ships you may go west without from
the uttermost to^ne, a fair way at 12 foot water. When you come from without
against it, then it dries up apace, as I said before, and as soon as you are
over the point of sand, the^ it is 3 fathom deep again. From the uttermost
tonne to the second tonne, the course is southsouthwest, there between them
both, it is at the driest of the drumple 3 fathom deep, at low water: being
over it, it is deeper again to the second tonne, which lies in the middle of
the w^ter, at 4 fathom and an half at low water. The west side (as I said
before) is steep and shoring, but the east side is a great way flat, you
may sound a great way east about the two uttermost tonnes along by the land,
at three, and three fathom and an half to the third tonne. From the second
tonne to the third, the course is south and by east, which lies on the
east side at 5 fathom, and between the second and the third tonne it is 7
fathom deep in the chanel. From the third to the fourth (which is the tonne
at Feihook) the course is s. s. e. it is a white tonne and lies upon the
east side at 3 fathom, Feihook.
there against it in the Bomesgat or chanel it is the narrowest, and there in
the middle of the water it is 7 or 8 fathom deep at low water. The west side
there against it is very steep and sloping, so that when a ship lies
against or upon it with the beak-head, it will lie 7 fathom deep behind at
the stern, and right cross from Feihook on the west side lies the sand
called Peter sand, which at low water is all dry. If you will sail in at
this chanel, you must reckon well your tides, for without the channels the
streams fall along by the land, and cross over the Bomekinsgat, till it be
half flood or half ebb, but then the flood begineth to fall right into the
chanel, and at half ebb to fall right out of it, which a man must have great
care to think upon, and to remember, when you will sail out or into this
chanel with a sharp wind. From the wite tonne at Feihook to the tonne at the
Bos, Bos.
the course is southsoutheast, it lies at five fathom on the east side by the
point of the Bos: between the white tonne at Feihook and the tonne at the Bos,
in the chanel, it is 7 or 8 fathom deep. From the tonne at the Bos to the
tonne at Hobbesand, Hobbesand.
the course is southsoutheast, when you sail up you may sail under it at 5
fathom, the right depth there between them both is 8, 9 and 10 fathom. The
tonne lies at the point of Hobbesand at 5 fathom low water, the west side is
all shoring and steep as I said before, and you must go no nearer to the
east side then 6 fathom, specially with a foreflood, for that would bring you
lightly behind the end of Hobbesand. Right over against the tonne at
Hobbesand lies the northerlyest white tonne of Speckhook, which you must leave
on starreborde, and right north from that white tonne there lies a Flat, which
at low wat^r is dry. From the tonne of Hobbesand to the black tonne at
Speckhook, Speckhook.
the course is s. s. w. it lies at 3 fathom low water, but the right depth
against it is five fathom: between the tonne at Hobbesand and this tonne, it
is in the right chanel 8, 6 and 5 fathom. East from this tonne the New or
South Iettingh goes in, and there the flood falls strongly in. The black
tonne at Speckhook, and the southerlyest white to^ne Be naminghe der plaetsen

map of Friesland lie about east and west distant from each other, but the
tonne at the Flat lies about w. s. w. from the black tonne at Speckhook, The
Plate.
but here you must look well to your streams and to the wind, for with the
flood you must sail west, to get above the tonne at the Plate, when you sail
up you leave the white to^ne on starreborde, and that lies at 12 foot low
water, but the tonne at the Plate lies at 3 fathom, and that you must leave
on baghborde, right against it it is in the chanel five fathom deep. But
between these two tonnes, that is, between the blacktonne at Speckhook and
the tonne at the Plate, it is very shallowe, for there at low water against
the white tonne that lies between them both, there is no more water then 14
or 13 foot. The white tonne is distant from the tonne at the Plate n. e. and s.
w. you may also sail somewhat north from this white tonne, over the
southerlyest point of Petersand, for when you come in, and are a little past the
tonne at Hobbesand, and the northerlyest white tonne at Speckhook, then there
runs a chanel or gutter about southwest through, wherein at low water there
is not less then 12 foot deep, when you are through it, and come against
Vlieland, and get deep water again, then you must sail in right forward
along by Vlieland.

The New Iettingh.
East from the tonne at Speckhook goes the New Iettingh in, as I said before,
you may sail into it, and come right north from the tonne of Langesand again
into the Vlie, therein lie three tonnes. When you come in, and will sail in
the New Iettingh, then you must leave the black tonne at Speckhook on
starreborde, and go on s. s. e. to the first tonne, there in the chanel it is
8 fathom deep. From the first to the second tonne it is south, from the
second to the third s. and by w. and there against it, it is deep 3 or 4
fathom at low water. These tonnes lie all on the west side which is very
steep, but Hobbesand or the west side is flat, which you may sound with the
lead, to the high beakon, which stands upon the point of the Iettingh. From
the third tonne to Langesand, the course is s. w. then when you come against
the tonne at Langesand, there upon the drumple lie two small tonnes, which you
sail through between, and then you are right north from the tonne at
Langesand. In the Vliestreame, there upon the said drumple it is 14 or 15 foot
deep at low water.

But to sail into the Iettingh, when you come about the high beakon, there
lies a white tonne at 3 fathom and an half on the south side upon a point of
sand, which without you may sail under, leave it on starreborde: from thence
you must go southeast forward to the second tonne, there in the chanel it is
8, 9 and 10 fathom, the north-side is all shoring so that you can not sound
it, upon it there stand some beakons, but the south side is fair and flat,
there you may sound it all along at 3 and 4 fathom, the second tonne is a
black tonne, and lies upon the north-side upon a Sand, which in going up you
may sail under. From the second tonne to the third, the course is s. s. e. and
s. e. and by s. when you are past it there is good Rode on the south side, that
is on Langesands side, at 3 or 4 fathom, then the town of Harling will lie e.
s. e. from you.

IIII. The situation of the North chanel.
THe North chanel was within few years become the best chanel in the Fly,
but it is so much altered, that now at this present it can hardly be used by
great ships, but only by small and flat bottomed ships. To sail into
the North chanel, set the northerlyest or easterlyest cape upon the Schelling
right upon Brandaris, then they will stand about s. s. w. from you, sail upon
them almost to the Schellingh strand, there you shall find the tonne at 3
fathom, right without the easterlyest point of Petersand, leave that to
Seaward from you, and sail w. s. w. to the second tonne, which lies at the
east end of the Bos at 14 foot low water, and there against it is no deeper
in the chanel, for thereabouts it is dryest, for when you are past it it is
deeper again, and you must leave that tonne on baghborde. From the second
tonne to the new ligger, New ligger.
(that is the third tonne, as you count them coming in) the course is w. s. w.
that tonne lies at 2 fathom and an half, on the south side, and there against
it in the chanel it is 3 fathom and an half deep. When you are by this new
ligger, then the middlemost cape and Brandaris stand one against the other, and
are s. s. e. from you. From thence, or right n. n. w. there runs a chanel
through Peter's sand into the Sea, in it there is 3 fathom, The Sle^ck or
Gutter.
and without in the drumple 12 foot water. When you have the said cape and
Brandaris one against another, keep them standing so, and so you go right out
of that gutter: also when you will come in out of the Sea, and have the said
cape and Brandaris one over against an other, and sail upon them, then you
shall go by the new ligger into the north chanel, this is a fair gutter for
small ships, the west side is shoring, but the east side is flat, which you
may altogether sound with your lead.

Old Ligger.
From the New ligger to the Old ligger the course is westsouthwest, and
southwest and by west, it lies also on the south side at three fathom, but
the chanel there is north four fathom deep low water, the north side is all
through shoring, but the south side is outward somewhat flatter, but inward it
is also shoring. From the Old legger to the tonne at Feihook the course is
southwest and by west, yet that reach it is all four fathom deep, you must
go close southward from the white tonne at Feihook., Feyhook.
for there it is very narrow, and the Bos is all shoring, so that you can not
sound it. Now when you are past the white tonne, then you come into Bomekins
chanel, and you find deeper water, that is, five, six and seven fathom. From
thence you must sail southwest forward, to the tonne at the Bos, and further
as is said in the description of Bomekins chanel.

V. The situation of the Land-deepe of the Schellingh.
THe Land deepth goes in by the foot strand of the Schellingh, it is a fair
chanel for small ships. To sail into it go along by the uttermost tonne of
the north chanel by the foot strand, and so run in by it, you cannot there
do amiss, ulesse you sail bluntly upon the land, now when you come almost
against the northerlyest cape, or about the length of the second tonne of the
Northern chanel, there it is dryest, and there at low water it is no more but
ten foot deep, being over it, it is three, four and five fathom deep,
sail forward by the strand, to the northerlyest point of the Schellingh, there
against it it is six fathom deep. Now when you have the length of the
northwest point of the Schellingh, then go southwest to the tonne at the Bos,
but take heed to your streams, that you be not carried by the flood upon
Ielmers Flat, which lies between the Schellingh, and the tonne at
Hobbesand. Now when you sail southwest from the northwest point of the
Schellingh, then you run over the point of Ielmers Flat, along at four
fathom, and you come between the tonne at the Bos and the tonne at Hobbesand
into Bomekins channel, Ielmer Flat.
and then go southsoutheast to Speckhook, and so forth inward as you are
taught before.

VI. Of the Island of Ameland, and how you must sail into Amelands chanel.
ABout two leagues eastward from the Schellingh lies Ameland, reaching
eastnortheast and westnorthwest four leagues. Upon the westende of Ameland
there stands a cape, and also a great flat steeple called the Holmes,
Hoelum.
the roof of this church is broken off, but the hindermost part of the roof
with the gavle is yet on, and stands upon the side walls. There was wont
also a church to stand in the same Island called Midland church, but that is
broken down, but on the east side of Holme church there stands a mill, with
a house west from the mill, also there stands a broad tower. There about
where Midland church was woonte to stand, there lie three or four downs, which
are low, flat and somewhat long. On the east end it is knollie black land,
mixed with some white among it. But quite upon the east end, there lies a
fair high round white down, which is very well to be known. From the west
end of Ameland there reaches a Sand almost three leagues into the Sea, which
is called Borneriffe. Bor^riffe.
And west from that riffe Ameland chanel goes in. This Borneriffe and the
north points of Tessel lie distant from each other northeast and southwest 12
leagues.

Thus Ameland shows, being about two leagues and an half from it, when you
are ove^ against it.
view of Ameland

IF you will sail into the Chanel of Ameland, coming out of the Sea, then set
the cape which stands upon the east end of the Schellingh, right against the
steeple of Horn, and sail upon it, and so you shall find the uttermost
tonne, which lies at the end of Borneriffe, at five fathom low water. Or if
you come out of the west, then run upon the strand of the Schellingh, at low
water at five, or five fathom and an half, and so go along by the strand, and
you shall sail right upon the uttermost tonne. Now when you come to the
uttermost tonne, then the cape and the steeple of Holme upon Ameland are also
one against the other, and stand then east and somewhat southerlyer from you,
but Horn church and the cape upon the Schellingh shall then stand
southsouthwest from you.

From the uttermost tonne to the second tonne the course is east, and a little
southerlyer, or hold the church of Holme upon Ameland standing right against
the cape, and sail upon it from the first tonne, then you shall not miss the
second tonne, which lies at seven fathom. When you have the length of the
second tonne, then you are past the Coggie deepes grounds. When you sound along
by the Schellingh at four fathom, then you shall not sail under the Coggie
deepes grounds. Between the first and the second tonne it is five or six
fathom deep in the chanel.

From the second to the third to^ne the course is east, and east and by north,
Gerrits Honden or Dogs.
that is the tonne at Gerrits honden, which lies at three fathom and an half
low water. You leave all these tonnes on baghborde when you sail in, for
Borneriffe on the inner side is all shoring, and specially Gerritshonden. Now
when you sail from the second tonne to the tonne upon Gerritshonden,
Campersand.
then Camper Sand is on your starreborde, and lies clean dry, you may sail
as close by it as you will. Between the second and the third tonne it is nine
and eight fathom deep in the chanel. When you sail against Camper Sand, you
must put over from it to the tonne at Gerritshonden, about eastnortheast, to
run above the Plate, which lies south from Gerritshonden, The Plate.
for there between them both it is not wide. Between Gerrits Honden and the
said Plate it is three fathom deep at low water. The Plate at the north end
is flatish, so that there you may sound it with your lead.

When you sail into or out of this chanel, keep good account of the streams,
and specially take heed of an ebb, for it f^lleth strongly cross over this
chanel, northnorthwest, over Borneriffe along into the Sea.

When you are above the Plate, there lies a white tonne at three fathom, The
white tonne.
or sixeteene foot water, which you must leave on starreborde, and run there
east about it. This white tonne lies distant from the tonne upon Gerrits
Honden southeast, past the tonne presently you find deeper water, as eight,
nine, ten, and twelve fathom, then go forth southeast and by east, so long,
until the steeple of Holme comes over the south point of Ameland, where the
Scutes lie, then you may go into the bought, where on the south side it is
very flat, and there you may ancker at five or six fathom, but on the
north side it is altogether shoring. This reach from the white tonne till you
be in the boucht is 9, 10, and 12 fathom deep, and on both sides is
altogether shoring.

If you will go further into the Horsen, then go on from the bocht
eastnortheast, along by the south side, at 5 or 6 fathom, To sail to the
Horsen forward.
so long till that Heynoms chamber (that is a red tyled house) be a handspake
length north from Holmer church, there ancker at 5 or 6 fathom, there is good
anckor ground, and there you lie safe from all winds, there also goes a little
stream. The north side is al shoring, and the chanel there is 12 fathom deep.

Borneriffe without also is all shoring. The situation of Bornriffe.
When you come out of the Sea, you must go no nearer to it then 12 fathom,
for then you shall not be far off from it. The whole Coast of Holland and
Freesland a man may not go nearer unto in dark wether nor by night then 14,
15, and 16 fathom, Warninge.
because of the grounds and Sands. When you come out of the east along by
Ameland, you cannot sail under Borneriffe, but if you run along by it at
seven fathom, then you shall not go a cast of a bullet outward from it.

A southeast and northwest moon makes a high water without, in the chanel of
Ameland, and also upon the land.

VII. The situation of Schiermonickooghe, and how you shall sail into
Scholbalgh.
THe Island Schiermonickooghe lies from the east end of Ameland distant east,
and somewhat northerlyer three leagues, it is a low smooth Island, about two
leagues long, there stand no special marks upon it, but on the west end
there stand two capes, with a white down, otherwise they are all low blackish
downs or hillockes, but higher then upon the east end, mixed with white. The
east end is a long flat strand, with low rugged downs.

Between Ameland and Schiermonickooghe the Scholbalgh goes in. Men were wont
to go in along by Schiermonickooghe, but that chanel is closed up within, and
wholly spoiled.

Thus Schiermonickooghe shows, when it is about two leagues cross from you.
view of Schiermonnikoog

To sail into Scholbalgh, set the capes upon the westende of Scheermonickooghe
one right against the other, To sail into the Scholba^gh.
then they shall stand about e. s. e. from you, sail upon them, then you shall
find the first tonne, which lies in the Sea, at 7 fathom low water. From
the uttermost tonne to the second tonne it is s. e. it lies at 4 fathom on
the south side, as you sail in you must leave it on starreborde, and go with
a flood at the least e. n. e. to the third tonne, which l^eth upon the point of
the sand at 3 fathom, but between this tonne and the second the chanel is
dryest, that is two fathom and an half at low water, and that right without
the third tonne, the south side is fair and flat, and you may sound it, but
the north side is all shoring, you must also look well to your streams, for
the flood falls strongly southward cross the lands, and the ebb contrary.
When you are past the third tonne, the course to the beakon upon the high Sand
is south, there it is deep 7, 8 and 9 fathom. From the beakon upon the High
sand sail forth s. s. e. s. e. and east, all along by the beakons, along till
you be before Oostmerhorne, and there anckor, on the south side it is all
steep and deep, and very white, but the north side is somewhat flat.

Northeast chan^l.
West from the Horsmarket there goes another chanel in, where at low water you
shall have but 8 foot deep, first it reaches w. s. w. and sometimes somewhat
southerlyer, but keep along by the Horsmarket, The Horsmarket.
specially with a south wind, so you shall go to the third tonne, at the
northwest chanel, (which lies upon the point of the chanel) and so into the
deep, leave that tonne on starreborde, and go forward southward to the beakon
upon the high sand, and there forth, as you are taught before.

VIII. Of the Island the Bosch, and how you must sail into the Lauwers.
FOur leagues east from Schiermonickooghe lies the Island of Rottum, between
them both lies an Island called the Bosch, which not many years since was
wholly overwhelmed, and washed away with a storm, and is now again (by means
that men have begun to plant heath upon it) grown up again, so that now
there lie two or three fair towns upon it. Between this Island of the Bosch
and the Ooghe the Lauwers go in.

The the Island the Bosch shows thus with two hillocks.
view of Bosch

To sail into the Lauwers ru^ne in east, close along by Schiermonickooghe.
Marks of the Lauwers.
There stand two towers in Groningherland, whereof the smallest or the shortest
is the loper, or the innermost, and is called Liens or Leens: the longest or
that which stands nearest to the water is called Hoorhouses: set the steeple
of Liens a bow length west from Hoorhouses, then it will stand upon the foot
strand of Schiermonickooghe, keep them standing so, and run upon the strand
of the Ooghe, for there you cannot miscarie, before in the chanel it is wide
and broad, and at low water no deeper then two fathom and an half, but when
you are over the drumple, then it is 4, 5, and 7 fathom deep, and reaches in
s. e. and by s. keep upon the Ooghe side, but beware you sail not under the
Knockbalgh, Knockbalgh. Symons sand.
which reaches through between the foot strand of the Oogh, and Symons sand,
yet keeping upon three, or two fathom and an half you need fear nothing, for
every year it lesseneth much, and is almost clean spoiled, but it is best
along by the High sand, on the east side, there also you can get no hurt. Now
when you are against Symons sand, there both the sides of the land are shoring,
so that you cannot well sound them with the lead, turn then somewhat southward
up about Symons sand, and anckor there at 7 or 8 fathom, there it is good
lying. You must look well to your stream, for there it falls strongly both
out and in.

IX. To sail into the Schille.
EAst from the Bosch goes in the Schille. If you will sail into the Schille
then place the two aforesaid steeples of Leens and Hoorhouses one right against
the other, and so ru^ne upon the Boscher sand, until you get drougth of the
sand, Boscher sand.
you may sound in all along west from Boscher sand, and also east along to
Rottum sand. About a year, or a year and an half since, the chanel was almost
5 fathom deep, but now before in the chanel at low water, no more then two
fathom and an half, but being over the drumple or threshold it is 10 or 12
fathom deep, first it reaches in s. e. til you come to the dry sand, that
is the sand of the Bosch, go in thereby e. s. e. to that Ila^d of the Bosch,
there you must sail in close by the land, for there it is very narrow
between the Bosch and the Sands, which come shooting off from Rottum, and the
Bosch is very shoring. If you will anckor there, Rode under Bosch.
then turn about right behind the point of the Bosch, there it is good lying
at 6 or 7 fathom: but if you will go somewhat better in, then turn off from
the Bosch, when you are full past it, and choose the north side, for that is
fair and flat, and that you may sound, but on the north side there lie many
sands, which you may sail under. Sail forward along by the north side till
you be behind Rottum, and there anckor at 8 or 9 fathom, Rode behind Rottum.
you lie there safe against all winds. When you will sail into or out of this
chanel, look well to your stream, for it falls strongly into and out of
this chanel.

To know the situation of the steeples in Groninghe land, you must understand,
To know Leens and Hoorehouse.
that when the steeple of Leens (which is the shortest) is a sparre length west
from Hoorhouse, then there comes a high house just as much eastward from
Hoorehouse as Leens is west from it, so that then Hoorehouse steeple stands
just in the middle between them, th^n you are right open before the Lauwers as
I said before. When those steeples aforesaid are one upon the other, then they
stand s. s. e. and somewhat southerlyer from you, then you are right against
Boscher sand. But when Leens church leaves that house and Hoorehouse steeple,
then you come against the Sands which shoot off from Rottum to the Bosch. A
southeast and northwest moon makes a full Sea in these channels or havens.

X. The situation of Rottum and Borcum, and how you shall sail into the West
Eems.
Rottum.
THe Island of Rottum is a small Island, almost a league and an half long, and is
very easily known: the west end is high and steep, and the rest is low
down land. Upon the east end there stand two capes or beacons: the greatest
or the loper stands upon the east end of the flat strand, and the smallest
stands upon the south side of the downs, there stand also two houses upon
it, the one upon the west end, the other in the middle of the land in a low
ground.

Borcum is also an Island well to be known, it is three leagues long, Borcum.
commonly when men come out of the Sea it shows in three parts, as if it
were three Islands, but when you come out of the west, then it shows in four
parts, for the water runs through it in three places, when it is a high
flood. The town of Embden has placed a high thick tower upon the west end
thereof, which you may see far into the Sea, and west from the tower there
stands a low church. From the west end of Borcum there shoots off a Sand,
Borcum sand.
a great way into the Sea, which is called Borcum sand. There southward,
between Borcum and Rottum the west Eems runs in, the best chanel in all
these coasts along.

Thus the Islands of Rottum and Borcum show when you sail along by them about
two leagues from the land.

Borcum.

view of Rottum and Borkum

Rottum.
view of Rottum

If you will sail into West Eems, then place the capes or beacons upon Rottum
one against the other, The ut^^^most to^ne.
then they will stand about s. e. from you, sail out of the Sea upon them, then
you shall find the uttermost tonne, lying at 6 fathom low water. But if you
come out of the w^st along by the land at 7 fathom then you shall also see the
aforsaid to^ne, when you are at the first tonne, then Borcum steeple will stand
e. from you, and the west end of Rottum will be about s. e. and by s. from
you. To landward from the second tonne there lies a Flat called Geltsack flat,
which reaches with her foot along to the fourth tonne; Geltsac^ Plate.
where upon at low water is no more then 15 16 or 17 foot.

From the first tonne to the second, third and fourth the course is e. The
second to^ne lies at 5 fathom, the third at 4 fathom and an half, that is
upon the driest part of West Eems. The fourth tonne lies also at 4 fathom and
an half, upon the point of the said Flat. All these tonnes you leave on
starborde when you sail in. When you come out of the west, and are against the
Lauwers or the Bosch sand, keep along by the land at 5 fathom until you be
past it, then sail on freely east, then you shall ru^ne through within Geltsack
flat, at 3 fathom and an half, and so come by the fifth tonne, into the deep
of West Eems, but keep the south side. Harling banckes.
Harling bancks which were woonte to reach out to seaward, at the westende of
Rottum are clean gone and worn away, so that now it is wide and broad
betwe^ne Rottum and the said flat.

The Sand of Borcum is without and at the end very flat, when the capes or
beakons upon Rottum stand southeast from you, then you may go well over the
sand, right to the fourth tonne, you shall there find no less then sixteen
foot water upon the foot of the Sand, at low water, for it is flat and broad,
but when you come within the Sand of Borcum, on the inner side it is shoring,
and then there shoots off a point or foot of Sand, which in sailing up you
may sail under, you may go no nearer to it then 7 fathom all along to Borcum.

The fifth tonne lies distant from the fourth s. e. and by s. and lies in the
middle of the chanel at eight fathom. But with an ebb and a southerlie wind
you go s. e. on, or else you would soon fall upon Borcum Sand, or behind the
point of Sand which comes shooting off from Borcum Sand.

From the fifth tonne to the sixth, seventh and eigth the course is all east and
by south. The sixth tonne, as also the seventh, lie in the middle of the
chanel, at 8 fathom: but the eigth lies at 5 fathom, Huyberts Flat.
upon the point of Huyberts Flat, which by others is called the Hackes, which
is a Sand which shoots off from the south side, you cannot miscarie with your
lead on Rottum or on the south side, but you may sail under this sand of
Huyberts Flat at 5 fathom low water, but at 6 fathom you must go without
about it. When you are by this tonne upon Huyberts Flat, then Borcum steeple
stands about n. n. e. from you, and there against it, it is 12 fathom deep
in the chanel.

Stephen Iohnsons tonne.
From the to^ne at Huyberts plate to Stephen Iohnsons to^ne the course is
southeast. That lies between the Balgh beacon and the Ruyt beacon, at seven
fathom and an half. Between these two to^nes the Eems is 10 or 12 fathom
deep. But when you go by the tonne at Huyberts Plate then you must turn
somewhat off from Borcum to shun the Mieuwe sand, which comes shooting off
from the Wolden, or the south end of Borcum, which when you will go in, you
may sail under at five fathom.

Westward from Stephen Iohnsons tonne, stands Wadt beakon, Wadt beacon.
where right south Wadt goes in. But on the other side right over against the
aforesaid tonne, lies the Ransel: which is a sand that comes shooting off
from the north side, which in sayl^ng up, you may sail under at 5 fathom. The
marks of this reach, The Ransel.
and to shun the Ransel are these: upon the south end of Borcum there lie
two downs, which are called the Wolden, The Wolden.
hold the steeple of Borcum on the west side of these downs, or west from
them, then you sail not by the Ransel. In this reach it is 9 and 8 fathom
deep.

From Stephen Iohnsons tonne to Docke tonne the course is s. e. Between these
two tonnes there stands a beakon on the south side, called the Ruyt beacon,
Docke tonne.
Ruyt beacon.
by this tonne the Eems is in the chanel about 7 fathom deep, and the tonne
lies on the south side at 5 fathom, upon a sand which in sailing up, you may
sail under. The flood falls very strongly behind this tonne into Docke
chanel, which you must be very careful of. Docke chanel.
The marks of Docke to^ne are these: when the closter of Dam, which is a
flat church, comes west from Old closter, so that you may see just between
them, then you have the length of this tonne, and then these marks are about
south from you. From Docke tonne to the last tonne it is e. s. e. when you are
past it then you shall see the beacons on the west side, sail all about by
them. The reach from Eems horn to Delfes I Will reaches all southerly, up to
Wadem. The marks of Eemshorne are these, there stands a mill in Embden land,
Marks of Eemshorn
about east and by north from you, and there stands a high house north from
the church, when that mill stands between the house and the church, then you
have the length of Eemshorne, and there stand three or four beakons about
Eemshorne, which lead you to Groaning land. When you come to Docke tonne and
are past it, then you may sound all the west side to Oterdam, at 5, 6, and 7
fathom, but go no nearer unto it, for it is very steep and shoring, but
there you may sail under the east side at 6 fathom, when you come within
Eemshorne sailing up, for there lies a Flat on the east side called the Hound,
The Hound. The Pap^
which is a hard sand, and somewhat more inward there lies an other Flat,
called the Pape, also a hard sand, and are fast one to the other. But here the
west side is all soft and claye ground to Oterdam. You must keep along by the
west side, and follow the beacons which stand along. This reach stretches
first s. s. w. and s. and by w. and about in a boucht or hollow place s. s. e.
and by Groaning land southeast.

To shun Reyders or Iannens sand, which is a Flat which lies in the middle
of the Eems, between Oterdam and Reyde, Reyders and Iannens sand.
(upon it at low water there is no more then ten foot deep) then take heed
of Oterdam, which has a flat church without a steeple, and stands upon the
banck of Groaning land, when you come thither then you must strike over to
Embden land to the Knock, which is now a broken steeple, standing in the water
upon the point, when you have the Knock then ru^ne within two ropes length by
the north side, along to Loegherhorne, The Knock.
and so you shall not sail by this flat. There stands a flat steeple
between Knock and Loegherhorn, Marks of Reyder sand.
called Gerrits Swart, when you may see through this steeple, or when this
steeple and the church come one upon the other, then you are against this Flat.

When you sail up the West Eems, then you must leave all the tonnes on
starreborde.

A southeast and northwest moon makes a high water with out the Eems. In the
Balgh a southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon. But before the town of Embden
a south and south and by west, and a north and north and by east moon.

XI. The situation of the Island Iuyst, and how you must sail into the East
Eems.
THe Island Iuyst lies about a league and an half e. n. e. from Borcum. It is a
low Island, but the west land is a high steep point, and grayish land: the
east end also is higher then the middle. The church stands in the middle of
the land, the steeple is somewhat sharp, and stands at the east end of the
church. You cannot see the church but when it is against a low piece of
ground, or a valleye. Between Borcum and Iuyst the East Eems goes in. Iuyst
sand.
From the west end of Iuyst there reaches a Sand, at least two leagues west
into the Sea, you may sound it without at 3 or 4 fathom, and south from it you
go into the East Eems.

Thus the Island Iuyst shows about two leagues cross from you.
view of Juist

To sail into the East Eems
If you will sail into the East Eems, then set the church upon Borcum south
from you, and so if it be clear wether, then you shall see through the
steeple, sail upon it and you shall find the uttermost tonne, which lies at
four, or four fathom and an half low water.

From the uttermost tonne to the second tonne the course is east and by south.
The end of Iuyst sand, between the two sands, on the inner side is very
shoring and steep, so that you cannot sound it, but somewhat more inward from
the second tonne it is flatter, so that there you may easily sound it.

The second tonne lies at three fathom low water, at the point of a long
small banck or point, which comes shooting off from the east end of Borcum,
which is called Brewers flat, Brewers flat.
which you may sail under, this Sand on the north side is all shoring.
Between the first and the second tonne it is four fathom deep at low water,
but against the second tonne it is deeper again, at 8 or 9 fathom. From the
second tonne the East Eems reaches in east and by south, and eastsoutheast,
and sometimes somewhat southerlyer, but from the second tonne with a flood you
must go east, and east and by north, that you may not be lead into the fore
side of Brewers flat. Iuyst sand is inward from the second tonne flat, so
that you may sound it at 5 or 6 fathom, but come no nearer unto it, and so you
shall not sail under Memers sand, which is a sand, Memers sand.
which within Iuyst shoots off from the foot-strand of Memers sand.

As soon as you have deeper water again, then go first eastsoutheast, then
southeast, to the beakon upon the high Horn, Beacon upon the high Horn.
which stands on starreborde upon the dry sand, turn southward or westward
up behind the beakon, there is the rode and there you may anckor at 5, 6 or 7
fathom, as you thinck good, it is there good lying for a south wind. The East
Eemes there against it is wide and broad. The east end of Borcum is flat,
you must use your lead, when you go there out or in with a ship that draws
much water.

About southeast, and south and by east from the beacon aforesaid lies the
tonne upon Conincx flat, (...) King^ (...).
upon a sand that shoots of from the south side, this tonne and the said
beacon you must leave on starreborde, and there between them both on the south
side there is good anckoring. At Norden in East vriesland there are two flat
steeples, whereof the one is great and flat, the other long and slender, which
stand one close by the other, when these steeples come a ships length east
from the easterlyest side of the Bant, (which is a small Island upon the Wadt)
then you have the tonne upon Conincx flat, that is a good long mark, and when
Iuyst steeple is n. n. e. from you, it is a good cross mark of the said tonne.

From the tonne at Conincx flat to the tonne at Hamburgh sand, the course is s.
e. and s. e. and by e. it lies at three fathom, Tonne at Hamburger plate.
but this is Pilots water for great ships. You may there go through a Kille or
small gutterie chanel into the West Eems, and come out against the southerlyest
tonne in the West Eems. To sail through this Kille, leave the tonne upon
Hamburger sand on baghborde, and sail along by the beacons, leaving them on
starborde. It is at both ends of this Kille three fathom deep, and in the
middle 5, 6, and 7 fathom, it reaches through about s. s. w. into the West
Eems.

Memer balgh.
Memer balgh lies about half a league within Iuyst, between the beacon upon
the high Horn, and the tonne at Conincx flat, that is on the east side of the
East Eems, and reaches most north in. It is a good rode for small ships that
will go west about, or without about. Also within the balgh which runs in by
the high Horn, there is a good rode for small ships which will go east about,
and reaches in south.

Iuyst sand.
When you come out of the east, then you may sound Iuyst-sand, for without it is
flat, as I said before, but without in the point of the said Sand there is a
Sheare or Dodebalgh like two points, where between them it is 3 fathom and an
half deep.

A southsoutheast and northnorthwest moon makes a high water in the East Eems.

XII. Of the Islands and Channels which lie between the East and West Eems.
Buys.
EAstward from Iuyst lies the Island Buys, which is a short small Island, and
upon all that Coast there is no Island so little as it is, it shows like two
hillocks, the easterlyest is the highest and sharpest.

Between Iuyst and Buys goes in the Buys chanel, the town of Embden was
wont to put to^nes in it, but now it is no more done, because it alters so
much.

Norderny.
Above a league and an half east from Iuyst lies Norderny, but between them
both lies the Island of Buys. This Island of Norderny is known by a broad flat
tower, which stands upon the west end, but sometimes you see but little
thereof. About the middle of the land, nearest to the east end, there lies a
high white down, whereby you know it, otherwise it is all uneven ground, full
of hillocks. Between Norderny and Buys the Norther deep or the Norderny
runs in.

Thus the Islands Norderny and Buys show being about two leagues cross from
you.

Norderny. Buys.

view of Norderney

A league east from Norderny lies the Island Baltrum, which is about two
leagues long, Baltrum.
and a little shorter then Norderny. There stands nothing upon this Island
whereby a man may know it, but on the east end there is a high down, which
on the top is sharp, and the west end is low downs. When the aforesaid
high down is s. e. and by e. from you, then it is round about to be seen, and
at the westende there goes a gulf through Between Baltrum and Norderny the
Wichtery runs in, Wichtery.
which is a chanel whereof there is nothing to be written, for it alters
many times. Anno 1606 it was 2 fathom and an half deep, but Anno 1607 there
was no chanel to be found of 4 or 5 foot water.

Thus Baltrum shows when it is about 2 leagues cross from you.
view of Baltrum

The Island of Langheroogh lies a league east from Baltrum, Langheroogh.
it is four leagues long, without it there is a fair strand, it has three or
four downs whereby you may know it, which lie from about the middle of the
land to the west end, they lie a good way one from the other, and on the
top are even and flat. Between Langheroogh and Baltrum goes in the Acumy,
Acumy.
within it there lie two tonnes, but it is no chanel for great ships, it
reaches out by Langherooghe, first n. e. and after somewhat easterly, along by
the foot strand of Langherooghe, but there is no hold to be taken of it, it
alters so often.

Thus the Island of Langherooghe shows being about two leagues from you.
view of Langeoog

Between Langherooghe and Wrangheroogh lies the Island of Spickerooghe, which
is about a league long. Spikeroogh.
On the east end there was wont to lie a small Island, which was well to be known
called Little Spickeroogh, but that is all washed and eaten away. On
Spickerooghe there stands nothing to know it by, but it is downie and
hilly, and black land, like the other Islands. Between Spickerooghe and
Langherooghe the Oxebalgh goes in. Oxebalgh.


Thus Spikeroogh shows it self, when it is about two leagues from you.
view of Spiekeroog

Wrangheroogh lies three leagues east from Langheroogh, Wrangeroogh.
it is about a great league long, it is a low white Island, but at the east
end there lie high broad white downs, and at the west end the Earl of
Oldenburgh has caused a great thick tower with two speeres to be set, when
they stand one against the other, then you are by the uttermost tonne of the
Weser, you may see this tower with two speers in the Sea. Between Wrangheroogh
and Spikeroogh the Harrel goes in, The Harrel.
about southsoutheast, it is also marked with two tonnes by the town of
Embden, but it is not to be trusted, for it alters many times, and serves
not also for great ships.

Thus the Island of Wrangeroogh shows when it is about two leagues cross from
you.
view of Wangerooge

To conclude the land from Bornriffe to Wrangheroogh reaches e. n. e. and w.
s. w. 29 leagues, or as some say 31 leagues. But the channels which lie there
between the East Eems, and Wrangheroogh are no channels for great ships, nor
we cannot write any thing of them, which may be trusted unto, for many times
in short space they alter both in stretching and depth.

XIII. How men shall sail up to the Iaa and West Weser.
IF you will sail into the Iaa or West Weser with a south wind, then ru^ne
upon the strand of Wrangheroogh at 4 fathom: but if the wind be westerlie,
then go at 5 fathom, and so go along in by the strand of Wrangheroogh at 4
or 5 fathom, until you be a good way within, or at the end of the foot
strand of Wrangeroogh, there you shall find the first to^ne, which lies at
low water at 5 fathom, then Menser church shall shand south from you. Against
this first tonne is the red sand very shoring, which you leave on baghborde,
but the to^ne on starborde. When you go in also against this first to^ne there
comes a Sand shooting off from the south side, which is the innermost point
of Steenbalgh, which you sail under at 3 and an half or 4 fathom, and the
first tonne is laid upon this point of Sand. Steenbalgh.
This Steenbalgh goes in east by Wrangheroogh, the south side of this Balgh is
shoring, and the north side is flat, so that you may sound it. In this Balgh it
is 10 foot deep at low water. From the first tonne to the second, and so
forth to the third, it is east. The Iaa tonne.
The second tonne lies at two fathom and an half, and the third at 3 fathom,
that is the Iaa tonne, which lies upon the entry of the High way. The High
way.
It is very uneven between the first and the third tonne, you have twice a
depth of 5 or 6 fathom, and then again two, and two fathom and an half.

If you will sail from the Iaa up to Weser, Mellem tonne.
then sail by the third tonne over the entry of the High way, n. n. e. to
Mellem tonne, but you shall find no more water there at low water, upon the
aforesaid drumple or entry, or by the third to^ne, then 10 or 9 foot, and when
you are over it you shall get deeper water again, and then you are in the
Weser: but look well to your streams, for the ebb falls very stif n. n.
w. out of the Iaa, Falling of streams.
and to the contrary the flood falls very hard inward, so that you cannot
get over the stream with still wether, therefore you must look well thereunto.

But if you will sail up the Iaa, then leave the third tonne on baghborde, and
from thence go up for the most part south, Hormmerscheel.
to the point of the banck of land called Hormmerscheel, and when you come to
it, then the Iaa is wide and broad, and without the said banck there stands a
beacon or two, for ships that will go before the Wadt. If you will go further
up the Iaa, then keep all the west side, but when you come against the church
without a steeple, which stands by the banck, there you must leave the west
side, because of the Aenten or Ieppe flat, Aenten or I^ppe flat.
which shoots off far along by the west side, and sometimes at low water
lies dry. The west side reaches most s. e. and somewhat southerlyer.

A south and north moon makes a high water at the Iaa, and there it flows
daily two fathom and an half up and down.

XIIII. To sail up the Weser.
TO sail up the Weser, go no nearer to Wrangheroogh then seven fathom, and
when you have 7 fathom, then turn off to 11 fathom, there you shall find the
first to^ne without in the Weser, Red sand.
lying at the point of the red sand at 7 fathom, then Menser church is s. s.
e. from you, which is a flat church without a steeple, standing in Vroukens
land. Now when you are against the first tonne, and that the west end of
Wrangheroogh is s. s. w. from you, then you run yet upon the point of the red
sand at five fathom.

From the uttermost tonne to the second, third, fourth and fifth tonne the
course is right east, and they lie all at seven fathom, the south side (that
is the Red sand) nearest, each a point differing from Menser church, so that
Menser church lies from the second tonne southeast, from the third south, from
the fourth south and by west, from the fifth southsouthwest. This fifth tonne is
called the to^ne upon the Head, Tonne at the Head.
and because you should know it before all the other tonnes, there stands a
pole upon it of half a fathom long, with a white knotte upon it. Right against
the tonne at the Head now there lies a white tonne, which Anno 1608 was there
first laid upon the white ground. Between these tonnes you must mark your
streams well, for the flood comes out of the northwest, and falls along
over the red sand, and the ebb the contrary. The right depth against these
tonnes aforesaid at the coming in is 11 fathom deep, but against the tonne
upon the Head it is five fathom at low water.

Right before the Weser lies the Middle plate, The Middle plate.
the easterlyest end, or the innermost side begins right north from the
tonne at the Head, by the white ground, and stretches along the reach, to the
third tonne, accounting from without, this plate is on both sides flat to be
sounded, and there lies a white tonne on the west side of the said plate,
about south and north from Menser church, which when you come in you must leave
on baghborde. If you will go east from the plate out again, from this tonne
upon the Head to sail to the Elve, then sound about by the white tonne at 4 or
5 fathom, till you be in the Sea.

To sail by east of the Middle plate out the Weser.
To sail up out of the Weser, the course from the tonne upon the Head to the
sixth tonne is s. e. and n. w. then Menser church shall lie from you s. w. and
by s. and there against it, the Weser is about 20 fathom deep. But from the
sixth tonne to the seventh, that is, the tonne upon the Course, The tonne at the
Course.
or the Wapper-tonne the course is southeast, this tonne is also called the
Southwest tonne, because Menser church as then lies s. w. from you. The Iaa
tonne lies about south and south and by west from this tonne. From the tonne
upon the Course to Mellem tonne the course also is southeast. You may sail
under Mellem tonne The Mellem tonne.
at six fathom. Menser church shall then lie from you s. w. and by west. From
Mellem tonne to the tonne upon Bollensile Bollensil.
the course is s. e. and somewhat easterlyer. There you must look well to your
streams, for the flood falls strongly in to the west side. Langheworder
church lies right south and by east from this tonne at Bollensile: over
against the tonne at Bollenzil, upon the point of the black ground lies a
white tonne, come no nearer unto it at half flood then four fathom and an
half: for if you sail inward, you may sail under the point at four fathom.
From the to^ne at Bollenzil to the beacon at Bollenzil the course is s. s. e.
and s. e. and by s. and then Longworder church shall stand about south from you.
You leave the beacon on starreborde, when you come in, and within the beacon at
Bollensil there is a good rode for a west wind. From the beacon upon Bollensil
to the first tonne upon the Flat The Flat.
the course is southeast, till you are a little beneath the beacon, but then it
is eastsoutheast. The marks of the first tonne upon the Flat are these, when
you may see through the holes of Langheworder steeple, then you are against the
first tonne, and then Longworder church is as southerly as s. s. w. from you.
From the first tonne upon the Flat to the second the course is e. s. e.
Between these two tonnes there stand five beacons, on baghborde as you come
in, upon the black ground. From the second tonne upon the Flat to the Mailand
the course is southeast and by south, but when you are against Wadnis, or the
Maieland, then sail along close by the green side to Blixem, A rode within
Blixem.
there is a rode for great ships that will put to Sea.

As at the Iaa so at the Weser a south and north moon makes a high water, and
it flows there two fathom and an half up and down.

XV. The situation of the East and West Til or Breebalgh, and how you shall
sail into it.
EAst from the Weser lie the south grounds South grounds.
of the Elve, there go in two fair and deep balgen or channels, of 10, 12,
and 13 fathom, they are called the Till or Breebalghen, Brebalghen.
the westerlyest lies about so far west, that a man may see the new work
from thence.

If it should chance that coming east from the Weser, you should fall upon the
south grounds, then sail upon the south grounds at 4 or 5 fathom, but not
much nearer, for that is somewhat shoring, and when you go in that manner
along by those grounds, in the same course you shall find 8, 9, yea and 10 or
12 fathom water soft ground, then for certain you have that of the Breebalgh
or the west Till, West Breebalgh or West Till.
keep then the land on which side you will, and go so about by the grounds,
at 4 or 5 fathom by the lead, and you shall find fair and good rode under
the sands, so that you shall there lie safe from all winds. This West Till
first reaches in e. s. e. along by the north side it is deepest, and on the
south side when you sail out you sail not under any Sands, but as you go
in. Now when you are somewhat within, then it reaches up southerly, and there
are several channels, where you may sail through, for such as are driven to do
it.

East Til.
The East Till haven lies between the West Til and the Hondbalgh, which
runs in at seven fathom, the east point (or the old Schor-horne) which is a
sand which reaches far out, you may sail under at 7 fathom, when you will
go to the Elve. This Till also (as the other) reaches eastsoutheast in, when
you come first in, but a little further in somewhat easterlyer. You may here
take which side of the land that you will, for when you come in you shall there
find shelter among the sands for all winds, and in this chanel it is not
less then seven fathom water.

But the Hondbalgh Hondbalgh.
lies right west from the Sh^ortonne or Schorhorne. If you will go in with
small ships, to go over the Wadt and sail into the Weser, then when you
have the Schortonne go in s. s. e. the Hondbalgh is indifferent wide, but hold
that course until you come against the beakons, which you must leave on
starreborde, when you will go up you may sound the Schorhorne from without
clean within, but not the west side, for there lie flattes, which you may
sail under from without, at 9 fathom, but upon the Schorhorne you cannot
miscarrie.

XVI. Of the Island of Holy land.
THe Island of Holy land, and the uttermost tonne on the Weser lie from each
other south, and somewhat westerlyer, and north and somewhat easterlyer, when
it is fair and clear wether, then you may see Holy land, when you lie in the
Weser, by the tonne at the Head. But Holy land and Bornriffe lie distant s. w.
and by w. and n. e. and by e. according to the common opinion 32 leagues. When
you come out of the west and begin to see Holy land, it is a high reddish
steep point which is flat upon the top. If you will anckor under Holy
land when you come out of the west, then run upon that land at 10 or 12
fathom. As you sail so to the south point and go somewhat near to the land,
you shall see a rock like a small steeple stand close by the high land, which
is called the Monck, The Monck.
which is almost as high as the high land. About s. s. e. and the third or
fourth part of a league from this rock there lies a stone or rock under the
water, A rock under water.
but if you keep at 8 or 9 fathom, then you run about without this Stone,
and cannot hurt yourself upon it: when the Monck is covered by the other land,
then you are against that stone, but when the said Monck comes a handspake
length past, or without the other land, there is good rode, and there you may
anckor at 10 or 11 fathom, there it is fair ground, and all over clean, if
it were not for wrackes of ships that have been cast away, or lost anckors,
whereof there are many there, when you be there at 9, 10 or 11 fathom then
you lie safe against a westsouthwest, northwest, and north winds. From the
point whereby the Monck stands there shoots a small Sand from the land,
which you may sound at 3 fathom. You may also go from the land at 5 fathom,
and sail safely from the rock aforesaid, that is, through between the rock
and the sand, but if you go deeper, at seven fathom, then you shall sail
upon the rock. But at 8 or 9 fathom then you go without the stone.

From the north side of Holy land there reaches also a bad sand almost a
league into the Sea, Holy land sand.
so that you may go no nearer to the north along then at 9 or 10 fathom, and
when you will go north about Holy land, coming so far that the east end
of Holy land is south, and south and by east from you, then sail boldly to
Scholvers point, which is a flat point, and that you may sound at 5, 6 and 7
fathom. For if there you will put off at 8 fathom, then you must run 3
leagues off from the land, and the right chanel which is between the Hever and
the Holy land, is not above 9 or 10 fathom deep. Now when you come about the
point into the rode, and that Scholvers point is northeast, and the Cliffe
southwest from you, there it is good anckoring at five fathom.

Scholvers point Scholvers point.
is the point where the south haven lies within, and reaches from the high
land about east into the Sea, and from the uttermost end of Scholvers point,
there reaches a banck of three fathom, to the point where the Monck stands,
there within it is very good lying for ships that draw not much water, and it
is the south haven of Holy land.

A southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes there high water.

When Holy land is e. n. e. five leagues from you it shows thus.
view of Heligoland When Holy land is north and by east from you it shows
thus.
view of Heligoland

XVII. How you shall sail up the Elve.
Holy land and the Schor-tonne (that is the uttermost tonne of the Elve) lie
distant southeast and by east, and northwest and by north.

When you come out of the west, and are past Holy land with a northerly wind,
then you may run to the north ground without fear at 10 or 12 fathom, for
between Holy land and the s^uth ground, or between the north ground and the
south ground it is 20 fathom deep, along to the Elve, but the nearer that you
go to the Elve, the shallower water you find. When you are within Holy land,
and find shallowe water of the North grounds, you may sound it all along to
the Elve at 8 fathom, for it is flat: but the South grounds are very shoring,
you may go no nearer unto them by night then 10 or 12 fathom, for if you go
nearer unto them, then you may sail under the West Til or Breebalgh, at 10 or
12 fathom.

To sail up the Elve, you must understand, that the North Elve which was wont
to go in north by the New grounds, is now so much altered, that you can
hardly find two fathom water in it: but to the contrary the South Elve,
southward from the New grounds, is broken through with a fair depth, so that
Anno 1606 was tonned by them of the town of Hamburgh, as hereafter is showed,
which was delivered unto me in writing, by Simon Derrickson of Vlieland, who
with great diligence has sounded and found out the same.

When you come from Holy land, or out of the west, and see the New work,
then bring the beacon and the New work one against the other, and then they
will stand southeast and by south from you, keep them standing so, and sail
forward upon them, then you shall find the Schor tonne, which lies on the
south land, against the Schor horn at 10 fathom half flood, leave it as you
sail on starreborde, for the south side is all shoring, from the Schor tonne
to the second tonne the course is east and by south, it lies at 8 fathom low
water, and the New work then stands from you south and by east. From the
second tonne to the third the course is east and by south, that lies at 5
fathom, the New work shall then stand from you s. s. w. From the third tonne
to the fourth the course is still east and by south, it lies at 4 fathom and
an half, then the New work lies from you s. w. and by s. Right over against
this to^ne there lies a white to^ne, which lies at the foot of the New
ground, which as you sail up you must leave on baghborde, but all the black
tonnes lie on the south side, and you must leave them on starborde. From the
fourth to the fifth tonne, and the sixth and seventh tonne, the course is still
east and by south. The fifth tonne lies at three fathom and an half, and
against it it is the dryest place of the Elve, the New work stands distant
from it s. w. and n. e. The sixth tonne lies at five fathom, and the New
work from it southwest and by west. The seventh tonne lies at 7 fathom, and
is distant from the New work s. w. and by w. and n. e. and by e. From the
seventh to the eigth to^ne the course is s. e. that is the tonne in the Ros, it
lies at 8 fathom, when you are against it, then the Ros beacon is against the
steeple of Gron or Groen. Right over against the tonne in the Ros, on the north
side, there lies a white tonne, upon a sand which comes shooting off from
Romarlplate, which in sailing up, you may sail under at 4 or 5 fathom, but
when you are past Ros-beacon, then there is a church with two speeres upon a
steeple called Oldenbrooke, when the speere steeple of Wordt comes west from
Oldenbrooke, then they are south from you, then you may sound Romerlplate at 6
fathom without danger, otherwise that plate is shoring without, and you may
sail under it, as I said before. From Ros tonne to the tonne at the Meem, the
course is s. e. and s. e. and by e. From the tonne at the Meem to the Gurtpot,
or the first tonne upon the flat, the course is e. s. e. From thence to the
tonne at the Oost, or Pilgrims sand it is e. and by s. From Pilgrims sand to
Brunsbuttle, the course is east and east and by north. You may sail under
Pilgrims sand at 5 or 6 fathom. From Brunsbuttle to the to^ne at Saltshorne,
or Vryburgher sand, the course is east and east and by north, all along by the
north land. From Saltshorne to the tonne which lies against the Steur it is e.
and by s. and e. s. e. From Steur to the tonne at Gringeroots sand, the course
is s. e. and s. e. and by e. This tonne lies against Bilenburgh, and lies
more then half in the deep. Between this tonne and the tonne at the Steur
lies another tonne in the chanel. But from the tonne at Gringeroots to the
tonne at Stadersand s. e. and by s. and s. s. e. This tonne you must leave on
starborde. From Stadersand to Willemsvliet, or the tonne of the Luy, it is s.
e. and s. e. and by s. And from the tonne at the Luy to the tonne at Terloo,
the course is e. s. e. From thence to the tonne at Hanebal, the course is e.
and by w. From Hanebal to the tonne at Blanckenes sand, the course is east and
east and by north, and you must hold the tonne against a great tree, and so you
run by the north land, til you be past the tonne.

From Blanckenes sand to the tonne in the bocht, the course is e. s. e. And
from the tonne in the bocht to the Eckehout e. and by n. there it is 3 or 4
fathom deep when you are in the right Kille or chanel, and there lie the
great ships to lade and to unlade.

Thus the New work shows when you come before the Elve.
view of Neuwerk

XVIII. Of the running of the streams, and what moon makes high water in
these places.
BEfore the Vlie a southeast and northwest moon makes a high water. What
moon makes a high water within the channels of the Vlie and Tessel stream,
and how the streams run there, it is at large described in the first Chapter
of the first Book. Without the Vlie the streams fall along by the land, till
it be half flood or half ebb, and then they begin to fall into Bomekins
chanel, and to fall out again. The fore-flood comes over Bomekins ground,
and so falls into the Schellingh, out at the north chanel, so that the fore
flood makes an ebb in the north chanel, and to the contrary the fore-ebbe
makes a flood there. Now when the flood begins to fall in, which is sooner
in Stortmelck then in Bomekins chanel, then it falls very stif upon the
Schellingh, and behind Grindt into the Iettingh, which you must take heed of,
but when the flood is about half spent, then it begins to fall right in, as
in the description also is showed, but at the other channels of Freesland the
flood falls sooner in.

Without in Ameland chanel a southeast and northwest moon makes a full Sea,
and also on the land.

At the same time it is also high water before the Scholbalgh, the Lauwers and
the Schille.

Before West Eems a southeast and northwest moon also makes high water.

In the East Eems and in Borckummerbalgh a s. s. e. and n. n. w. moon makes
high water.

Before the town of Embden a south or south and by west, and north and north
and by east moon makes high water.

Before the channels between the East Eems and the Weser, a s. and s. and by e.
and a n. and n. and by w. moon makes high water.

Under Holy land with a n. n. e. and s. s. w. moon it is a full Sea.

Before the Weser and before the Elve, a north and south moon. There the flood
comes northwest without, and the ebb southeast, and so fall strongly over
the grounds.

In the chanel between the Elve and the Vlie, the fore floods come out of the
North Sea, and go about with the Son, and fall but half the tide along by
the land, that is eastnortheast, and the ebb westsouthwest.

XIX. Of the Grounds and Depths about these Countries, and at what depths you
may see the land.
THe Island of the Vlie, the Schellingh, and Texel you may see at 15 or 16
fathom.

Against the Schellingh you have white Sand, and close by Peter's sand it is 12
or 13 fathom deep. You must take heed of the grounds of the Vlie, as of
Bornriffe, for they are very shoring.

You may see Ameland at 12 fathom, and it is very far flat at 12 and 13
fathom, so that at 15 fathom you can not see it.

You may see Schiermonickoogh at 12 and 13 fathom, and then it is about four
great leagues from you.

You may see Rottum and Borcum at 14 and 15 fathom. Against Borcum the ground
is great read sand, with some black amongst it.

Iuyst may be seen at 13 and 14 fathom, and three leagues from the land it is
12 fathom deep.

Buys and Norderny you may see from the poope at 12 and 13 fathom.

Baltrum, Langheroogh and Wrangheroogh you may see at 14 and 15 fathom.

About Holy land it is 7, 8 and 9 fathom deep, that is, on the inner side:
but without on the west side it is 15, 16, 18 and 19 fathom, and at such
depths you may see the Holy land.

What notable marks stand upon these Islands, whereby you may know them, it is
perfectly and at large declared in the description of them.

XX. How these lands are distant from each other.
FRom the Vlie to the northnortheast end of the Broad fourteen the course is
westnorthwest 8 leagues. Petersand and Borneriffe lie distant about northeast
and by east, and southwest and by west 4 leagues. From Borneriffe to West-Eems
e. n. e. about 13 leagues. or as some will 15 leagues.
From Borneriffe to Wrangheroogh about 29 leagues. From Borckummer riffe to
Wrangheroogh e. n. e. 16 leagues. From East Eems, or Iuystriffe to Schortonne
n. e. 20 leagues. From Wrangeroogh to the New work e. n. e. 8 leagues. Holy
land and Borneriffe lie distant n. e. and by e. and s. w. and by w. as men
commonly say 32 leagues. or as some say 34. leagues.
Holy land and Borkummer riffe lie from each other n. e. and s. w. Holy land
and Langheroogh lie distant northnortheast and southsouthwest. Holy land and
the uttermost tonne in the Weser lie distant from each other, south and
somewhat westerly, and north and somewhat easterly. But the tonne at the Head
in the Weser, and Holy land lie distant south and north 8 leagues. Holy land
and the Schor tonne or the New work lie distant s. e. and by e. and n. w. and
by w. 8 leagues.
XXI. How these Lands are distant from other Countries.

CHAPTER II. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Iutland, and the Iutish
Islands, lying between the Elve and Rifhorne.
I. To sail into the South and North Pip.
IN the Chapter before it is showed how you shall sail into and out of the
Elve. About seven leagues north from the Elve lies the Eyder, but there right
south lies the North Pip, and a league south from the North Pip lies the South
Pip, The South Pip.
which lies right east from the Holy land, and goes in e. s. e. at 5 or 6
fathom, through the North grounds, and at the north end of Hodemer sand
comes into the flat stream, whereon there stands a beacon, which you must
leave upon the starreborde, when you will sail up into this haven.

The North Pip North Pip.
as I said lies a league northerlyer then the South Pip, and is separated from
the Eyder by a Sand, which is called Blaweoort, Blawoort.
or the point of the Hound, which runs off from the beacon upon the Hound,
and so far in^o the Sea, almost half way to Holy land. There right south
the North Pip goes in, and reaches in most part east and east and by south,
to the beacon at the Hound.

Erom the beacon at the Hound to Hudemer sand it reaches forward most s. e.
and s. e. and by e. you may sound it from without clean within along by the
south side at 3 and 4 fathom, as far as within the beacon at the Hound,
leaving the said beacon on baghborde.

When you come within Buysen, there it is twice or thrice crooked, and there
stands a beacon upon the north end of Hudemer sand, leave it on starborde,
and then go up eastward, till you be about the Sand, which shoots off from
Hudemersand, there you shall find a beacon, which you must sail up unto, and
leave it on baghborde, and go s. w. then you shall find another beacon upon
the east side of the flat stream, standing upon Roomaerder sand, sail out by
the same, leaving it on the left hand, and then you shall come out at the old
Elve.

II. To sail up into the Eyder.
RIght north from Blauweoort the Eyder goes in, and lies distant from Holy
land east and by north, and when with that course you fall upon the land, then
you shall see a sharp steeple upon Eyder town called Gartinghen, Gartinghen.
which is an indifferent long steeple you must bring it on the south side of
the downs, which are called the South heads, South heads.
and then they stand from you n. e. and by n. or somewhat easterlyer, and with
these marks you must sail over Blauoort, so long until you find deep
water, as 5 or 6 fathom soft ground, then you shall see a sharp steeple stand
in Ditmarse called Weselborne, bring that east or somewhat southerlyer from
you, and go in e. and by s. and sometimes somewhat easterlyer, till the Buys
be s. e. and by s. from you, and that the beacon at the Hound stands s. s. w.
from you, then Ees will come a ships length north from Tatinghen, which is the
southerlyest of the two flat churches standing upon Eyderland, then go up
northnortheast, for then you are within the New grounds, then there comes a
Sand on the starreborde side shooting off from Ditmarse, which is called Hecke
sand, Hecke sand.
when you are past this Hecke sand and the New grounds, then you come against
the green land of Coebergh or Cow-hill.

A little way within Koebergh there comes a Sand shooting off from Eyder
side, which you may sail under, as you go along by the Eyder side, so that
you must run into a Dead chanel, where you must come backward out again.
Behind or in it there lies a small village of seven or eight houses called
Ulckhorne, Vlckehorne.
there men lade oxen, and there the oxen come to be bought.

When you come about Heckesand or against Koebergh or Cowe-hill, then the Eyder
reaches from the aforesaid Sand which comes shooting off from Eyderstede
east and by south. When you are past that Sand, then the Eyder reaches
eastnortheast, and northeast and by east to Tonninghen. Tonninghen.
There also they lade oxen.

Or to get into the Eyder otherwise, To go another way into the Eyder.
when (as I said before) you come from Holy land, then bring Gartinghen before
the downs, and ru^ne by the south side at 3 fathom, keep the steeple
standing so, and sound about by the south side, till you get deeper water, and
bring the sharp steeple in Ditmarse aforesaid east or somewhat southerlyer
from you, hold that standing so till you be within. But if you will go up the
Eyder, then choose the north side when you come in, because of the Pip, for
without the Pip and the Eyder is all one chanel, and the sand of the Hound
whereon the beacon stands, shoots there between them both a great way
into the Sea, as I said before, and you may sail over the sand into the north
Pip, a little westward from the beacon at the Hound, Beacon at the Hond.
therefore you must there run over the sand in time, if you will go into the
Eyder, otherwise you may sail under the north side inward from without.

But from the north you cannot well get to the Eyder, because of the points
which ru^ne off from the grounds. But there look well to your streams, for
without the Grounds the streams fall in most part southeast, and northwest
out, and a south and north moon makes a high water there.

The Eyder is 6 or 7 fathom deep, soft ground. And when you will go out of
the Eyder into the Pip, To go out of the Eyder into the Pip.
then you must go out so far, until Tatinger church come upon the east end
of Ees, there you may go over the Hond sand, you shall not there have less
then two fathom and an half at high water.

The Land chanel of the Eyder.
The Land chanel, or the Northchanel of Eyder for the most part reaches in e.
and by n. right up upon Koebergh, you must get to that from the north, to sail
in north from the New grounds, they lie upon the south side of this chanel,
and then you come against the Koebergh again into Eyder stream.

About two leagues north from Koebergh, or from the said Land chanel, there
lies another chanel or balgh, which you may sail up into, there stand two
beacons in it, and it reaches in most east and by north to the south downs of
Ees, then you may go along by the land, till you be behind the Island Utto.
You may also in that chanel run along by the south downs of Ees, to
Koebergh, and so come again into the Land chanel of Eyder, but it is very
crooked. You may not use this unles you be driven to it, these are bad channels,
because they are flat so far out, therefore it is not well to be done,
unless a man be forced to search these channels of necessity.

Thus the land of Eyder shows

Ees Gartinghen. North head. Tatinghen. South head.

III. How to sail up the Hever.
TO sail from the New work, or from Schor tonne to the Hever, you must
understand that the course is north and south, distant 11 leagues, but always
look well to your streams, for as I said, the fore flood falls very stif
cross over the grounds into the land, and the ebb contrary, but when you are
half way, then you meet with Blawoort sand (whereof I spoke before) at the
depth of two or three fathom.

But to sail from Holy land to the Hever, then go on n. e. and somewhat
easterlyer, according as the wind and stream suffer, and run upon the
Grounds at 6 or 7 fathom, then you shall find an indifferent high steeple,
which on the top is sharp, it is called Pielworme, Pielworme.
set this steeple northeast and by north from you, and a mast length south from
the southerlyest Cowehouse, which stands upon the Island of Nubal, Nubal.
keep the steeple standing so, and sail up to it, then you shall find the
uttermost tonne, then go from the first tonne to the second tonne northeast,
and northeast and by east, and coming to it, then Pielworme steeple will stand
n. n. e. from you. From thence the course inward is n. e. and by e. and when
you come a good way in, the^ you find two beacons standing there on
starborde, upon a dry sand called the Quade, The Quade a dry sand.
right over against it comes the North chanel into the right Hever. The North
chanel North-balgh.
comes reaching in from the north, about east and by north from Pielworme,
and comes right upon the I Will of Nubal, whereon the Cowehouse stands, and
you may sail up northward or n. n. e. from the Cow house to the end of the
strand, where there stands a flat church, it is a deep chanel. You may
also sail from the I Will of Nubal into the right Hever, and then you come
against the Quade again into the right deep, as is aforesaid. To sail up
into the Hever the course from the first beacon to the third is e. and by n.
sail along by the beacons, leaving them on starborde. Between the first and
third beacon on the north side it is all full of sands and flattes, there you
may sail behind them.

By the third beacon the South chanel South-balgh.
comes into the Hever, and comes running off from the Island Utto, about n.
e. and by n. and reaches from the northende of the I Will of Utto into the Sea,
and it is above a league to sail into the Sea.

From the the third beacon to the two other beacons, the course is northeast
and by east, then you come to the Green land, which lies on starborde, then
it is a four squared chanel, which is wide and broad, you may there sail in
the middle of the water to Hoesem, Hoesem.
just to the bridge, or you may anckor where you will.

Without in the Hever the north side is shoring, therefore keep by the south
side, till you are within all the beacons. The chanel is two fathom and an
half deep at half flood, and it is very far flat water. There lies also
a banck a good way without the Hever, which you must remember when you will
sail in. A south and north moon makes a high water there.

IIII. To sail into the Small or Narrow Chanel.
THree or four leagues north from the Hever lies the Small-deepe. Small deep.
He that will sail from Holy land to the Small-deepe must go northeast and
by north, and run upon the Grounds about west and by north from Pielworme,
then the south end of Ameren will be north or there abouts from you, then
seek for the south side, and sound about it, you cannot do amiss on the
south side, for it is a rising ground, which lies far without the land, then
sail in north and by east, northnortheast, and northeast and by north, then
you shall find a sand or raveling, which you must leave on baghborde, you may
sound about by it, until you come in, you must keep the south side, and sound
about by it, going in northeast and by north. On the north side there lie many
sands and out-points, but if you let the aforesaid shallowe lie on starborde,
then you come into a Dead chanel, where at the beginning you shall have 7
fathom deep, but it runs all on a heap to nothing. And when you have
sounded so far about the aforesaid shallowe, that you come against the south
end of Ameren, then you may sail under the north side, for there comes a
sheare of the Wadt shooting off from Voren. Then choose the south side till you
come against Voren.

V. To sail into the Roode deep or Silter chanel.
TO sail into the Roode deep or Silter chanel, coming northward, or out of
the Sea, you must run in the sight of the Island of Ameren, and about the
middle of the Island of Ameren there lies a white round hill, a little higher
then the other hillocks, in a low plain valley in that Island, place that
down or hill northeast from you, Marks to reach the chanel.
and keep it standing so, and run up upon it, until you be within the sand,
which shoots off from the Foretrap, and is commonly called Ameren borne,
Ameren Borne.
and you cannot fail thereon, for then you shall have no less then three
fathom water upon the point of the Sand, and coming within the said Sand, 11,
12 or 13 fathom water. Sail so forward till the north end of Ameren be north
and by east from you, when you have these marks standing thus as aforesaid,
then run upon the north end of Ameren, till you come within the dry sand,
there you may anckor where you will, or sail as far in as you will, and
sound along by the sand. The strand of Ameren also is a fair strand, without
sands, which you may sail under. But when the said hill lying upon Ameren is
e. n. e. from you, and you should sail up to it, then you go to near the
said sand of Silt. The hill then is divided into two parts, and then the
northerlyest is the smallest.

But if you will sail into the Roode deep or the Silter chanel coming from
Holy land, To sail into Silter chanel coming out of the south.
and see the land, then set the northende of Ameren north and by east from you,
till you come between Ameren and Silt sand, and then so in by Ameren strand,
till you be about the north point of Ameren, so long till Ameren lies south,
and s. s. w. from you, you may not sail any further into this chanel, for
then you come against the Island of Vooren. There lie two riffes or bad sands,
the one lies about w. s. w. from Ameren, and is dry above the water, which is
a great way f^at, at 3, 4 and 5 fathom, and by the Iutters is called the
Borne, or Ameren Borne, Ameren Borne.
although it is not fast to Ameren, for the Roode chanel goes in there
between them both. It is not also fast on the Voortraps or the south end of
Silt, although it comes shooting off from thence, for between them there
goes a Fishermans chanel into the Sea of a fathom and an half, where the
Fishermen go daily out to fish, specially they of the Island of Vooren. This is
the uttermost Sand lying on the chanel, such as use much to these places, as to
Repen and the places there abouts, are very fearful of Ameren borne, when
they come from the Holy land, and they find this dry sand about w. s. w.
from Ameren. The other Sand shoots off from the south end of Ameren, The
other Riffe.

Ameren.


reaching about south and south and by west into the Sea, along by the land.
This also by many is called the Borne, or Ameren borne. If you come from Holy
land, and will go north about, you need not fear this Sand, for it shoots
out most by the land.

Thus the Island of Ameren shows.
view of 'Ameren' (island in Germany)

VI. To sail into the haven of List.
ABout eight leagues north from Silter chanel there lies a very fair haven
called List, which runs in at the north end of the Island of Silt. To sail
into this haven of List coming out of the south, Marks to reach the chanel.
then run so long about the north at 6 or 7 fathom, until you see a small
Island within the land, without the point, whereon you shall then see a house
standing, which is called Iurtmans house, when you have that house a masts
length without the point of the List, then go in e. and by s. and e. s. e. and
keep these marks standing so, until you are within the point of List, then
turn up about the point southward, and anckor before the Voochts house, there
it is 9 or 10 fathom deep.

Without in the chanel there lies a Flat or Sand called Haef sand, that you
leave on baghborde when you come in, without it is very flat, and you may
sound it when you come out of the north. Marks to avoid.

Haef sand.


To shu^ne it when you come north ward, you must turn or put of so far from
the land, till the red cliffe comes without the downs, or that you see it
full, for then you may well go over Haefsand, with ships that go not very
deep. And also when you come out of the haven of List and will go north
about, then sail so far out, that you may see the cliffe, then you may also
go over the said Sand. This Sand reaches off from the south end of Rem, a
good way into the Sea.

On the south side of the haven of List, there lies another Sand or Banck,
along by the land, not very far without the strand, named Rust or Rusting.
Rust or Rusting.
To sail into the chanel of List coming from the south, you must in time
sail upon the land of List, about the red Cliffe, because of the Rust, which
comes shooting off from the north end of List, along by the strand, and when
you are by the land, and come a good way within the red Cliffe, then there
comes a Flat shooting off from the land, which you must shun somewhat,
but you may sound it very well, and keep all the foot strand, and you can not
fail therein. Rust is a small banck, The situation of Rust sand.
which shoots along by the strand, and begins against the innermost point
of List, and reaches till it comes about the red Cliffe. From the inner
point of List also shoots off a Sand which you must also take heed of. Now
when you come within the innermost point of List, and are before it, then you
may anckor where you think good.

But if you will go to Lutke Tunderen, To sail to Lutke Tunderen.
then leave the Sand, which lies south from Iure sand on starborde, and ru^ne
through between them both, but if you will go to Hoesem or to Silt, over the
Wadt, To sail over Wadt to Hoesem.
then leave that Sand on baghborde, and upon Voorn there stand two or three
trees, which you must keep against the westerlyest church or steeple, and so
you must go to Voorn.

Between Haef-sand or Haes-sand and the Island of Rim, there goes another
chanel in, The Land deep of List.
of about a fathom and an half water. The I Will of Rim is about 3 leagues long,
without it is very flat, so that you can hardly see the land at six or seven
fathom.

About eight or nine leagues without the Island of Silt there lies a Banck
along by the land of eight or nine fathom deep, it is about two leagues long,
and near as long as the Island, between this Banck and the Island, it is
thirteen fathom deep, but when you are at nine fathom without the Island of
Silt, then Holy land lies about south from you.

Thus the Island of Silt shows when you sail along by it.

VII. To sail into Knuyts or Ryper Chanel.
FRom the Haven of List to Knuyts or Ryper chanel the course is north and
south, about 7 leagues: but Ryper deep and Holy land lie distant north and
somewhat southerly, and south and somewhat easterly. To sail into Knuyts or
Ryper chanel, when you come out of the south, then run by the flat of Rim and
Manu, about to the south end of Phanu, called South head or South point, then
you shall see two capes or beacons upon a dry sand stand a little southward
from South head, bring these beacons a little before each other, that is, the
innermost or longest a little, or a hand spoke length north from the shortest or
uttermost, then they will stand east, or somewhat northerly from you, let them
stand so, and there you shall find the uttermost tonne, which lies at four
fathom on the north land, which you must leave on baghborde, and go to the
second to^ne, e. and by s. and when you are by the first tonne, then you may
see the second, yet they lie a great way one from the other, you must leave
the second tonne also on baghborde, keep along by the south land till, you be
past the beacons, for there shoots off a Flat from the uttermost beacon to
the second to^ne, which you must shun somewhat. When you are past the
beacons, then loose because of the Sand whereon the beacons stand, and there
anckor where you will, for there it is deep and shoring or steep, there you
can do no harm. The Ryper ships which come out lie there staying for a
wind. In this chanel it is 20 foot water at half flood, but at a high water it
is not the best chanel, for it is narrow and flat a great way without: and
then when you have gotten that, then you may see both the sides of the land
ravle, when the wind blows somewhat hard. But when you come out of the
north, then you must ru^ne upon the south end of Phanu, until you see the
beacons aforesaid, and then do as I showed you before. The Moon being
southsouthwest, and northnortheast makes there a high water.

VIII. To sail into the Grouwe deep, and Schellingh kroegh.
ABout n. e. and n. e. and by n. from the north end of Phanu there lies a
little Hill as if it were an Island, called Luysbergh. Luysbergh.
A little north from it there lies a long plain sand hill which is called
Langhelech, Langhelech.
from thence the land reaches northwest, from the south to the west side.

Between the north point of Phanu and Langhelech Grouwe deep Grouwe-deepe.
goes in. To sail into it when you come out of the south run along by the
Island, and sound along about the north point, till you get deeper water. The
north end of Phanu is flat very far. Now when you get deeper water, then you
shall see three or four hillocks about northeast from you, upon the high land,
with a flat steeple called Holm or Bruynum, bring this church a cables length
north from the hillocks, and then when you have the depth, then those marks
are northeast from you, then go in n. e. and keep the south side, till you
come within by the dry sand, called Smeur sand, Smeur-sand.
which shoots off from Phanu, there you may well go along by direction of
the eye without failing, and let that be on starborde as you come in. The lands
there on both sides are very shoring, both Wisdyke Wisdyke.
(which is the Flat which lies in the chanel) and Smeursand also. When you are
past the point of Smeursand, then turn over to Wisdyke, and there anckor, till
you have the lowest water, then you may sail to Hartinghen, and go to Wardt
or Woordt Woordt.
which lies 8 or 9 leagues within the land, but the River goes crooked,
whereon now and then a house or Gentleman's lodging lies.

A southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes high water here, and it
flows here with a continual tide about a fathom up and down.

From Phanu to Schellinghrock it is four leagues. Between them both lies
Suydersid, Suydersyd.
which is a River of 8 or 9 foot water. The land between Langhelech and
Suydersid is knottie down land, rough and overgrowne with heath. If you chance
to come to land, or to fall upon Suydersid, and could not get into the chanel,
then choose the land of Langhelegh, you may ru^ne upon it without any danger,
but keep at 2 fathom and an half, then you cannot mis-sayle that Kroech, for
you may sound all this land from Langhelegh till you be within Schellinghkroech
Schellingh kroech.
at three fathom and an half: but if you come to three, or three fathom and
an half, then you would sail miss the dry sand, and go without the Kroech
aforesaid. Schellingh kroech reaches in northwest for the most part, To sail
into Schellingh kroegh coming out of the north.
and there you lie safe against all winds, as if you lay in the Ketle at
Koninghsberghen.

But if you come out of the north and will go into this haven, you may well
sound about that dry sand at three fathom. And when you come by the innermost
point of the dry sand, there shoots a Sand off, but you may see it well and
avoid it: now when you come to the east end of that Sand, then loofe up by
the Sand into this Kroech, and there anckor at two fathom and a foot water,
there it is somewhat wide, you may well go in a pritie way, and laveere in. A
southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes a full Sea there, but the
further you go about northward to Iutland, NOTA.
there goes less stream, and it flows less up and down.

On the north end of the aforesaid dry sand lies the Dead-hill, which is a
short piece of a down, which lies alone, when you are somewhat off from it,
then it sayleth under the other land, and then you see it not. But coming from
the south and north, then you may always see it lying. From Dead hill to the
south end of the dry sand, it is all fair strand, and fair flat ground.
If you will anckor under the dry sand when you come out of the north, Rode
under the dry sand.
then you may sound along by it round about, and get good harbor for a
northwest wind, and also for westerlie winds.

Right north from the Dead hill lies the Horn, where the Reef horn shoots
out, whereof I will speak more in the next Chapter.

Thus the Island of South-sid shows south from the Dead hill.

Dead-hill. South Side. Langelegh. Luysbergh.

view of the 'Iland of South-Sid' (Denmark)

IX. Of the falling and running of the streams at these Islands and Coasts of
Iutland, and what Moon makes high water there.
IN the Pip, Eyder and Hever a south and north moon makes high water, the
flood comes there out of the northwest, and the ebb southeast, and runs
so over the North-grounds.

In the chanel of List or Silt a south and north moon makes high water, and
the flood comes out of the northwest, and falls little along by the land,
but the ebb the contrary.

In Knuytes Seepe a southsouthwest and a northnortheast moon makes high
water: there also the flood comes out of the northwest, and falls more then
a great quarter thereof along by the land, and the ebb the contrary.

In the havens of Suydersid, Grouwe deep, and Schellinghkroegh a s. s. w. and
a n. n. e. moon makes high water. The flood there also comes out of the
northwest, and falls over the Reef horn to the Iuts Islands, the ebb also to
the contrary off from the land to the North Sea.

X. Of the grounds and depths about these lands, and at what depths you may
see them being at Sea.
IN Ditmarse, the land of Kidingh, and Botjaghers land the grounds lie so
far without the land, or the Coasts, that you can not see the Coasts, unless
you clime up into the top of the mast.

The grounds of Hever, and the bancks of the Small deep without Strand and
Yederstee, they lie about two leagues without the Coasts of the land.

Between Holy land and Ameren or Strand it is 10 or 11 fathom deep, and at
that depth you may see both the lands, if you clime up into the shrowdes. You
know Strand by the steeple of Pielworme, standing upon the south end of the
land, there stand more churches and steeples upon the Island of Strand, but none
of them is so well to be known as Pielworme.

Ameren is a great league long, it is all low downs, overgrowne with heath.

The Island of Silt may be seen at 10 fathom, upon the Island nearest to the
north end there lies a high shoring read cliffe going steep down on both
sides. On the south side of the cliffe there stands a flat church with a low
clock-house, and eastward stands another church with a high thick steeple,
called Heydom. The north end of the land is called List, but the south end is
called the Voortrap.

XI. How these Lands lie distant from each other.
FRom the uttermost tonne of the Elve to the Eyder north and south 7 or 8
leagues. From the Eyder to the Hever the land stands northnorthwest and
southsoutheast 5 leagues. From the Hever or the south end of Strand to the
south end of Ameren n. n. w. 5 leagues.
Ameren is a small Island of two leagued long.

Two great leagues north from Ameren lies Silt, it is about five leagues long,
and reaches s. and by e. and n. and by w.

From the north end of Silt called List to the south end of Rim or Rem it is
n. e. and s. w. a league long, and the I Will of Rem is three leagues long, and
reaches most south and north.

From the north end of Rem to the south end of Manu it is n. e. and s. w. a
league long, but you can not well see it, because of the grounds and great
flats which reach out there from the Sea.

Manu and Phanu lie about two leagues distant from each other. Manu is about
half a league long. The Island of Phanu is about three or four leagues long, and
reaches from Phanuknuyts to Knuyts chanel s. s. e. and n. n. w. This Island
has also a fair bottom, but the north end is flat very far to the Grouwe
deep.

From Phanu to Deadhill or Dodenbergh it is about 4 leagues. Between them both
lie the havens of Grouwe deep and Schellinghkroegh, as it is showed elsewhere.

XII. How these Countries are distant from other Countries.
FRom Holy land to the Eyder it is east and by north and west and by south 7
leagues. From Holy land to the uttermost tonne in Hever it is n. e and s. w. 8
leagues.
You may anckor by the uttermost tonne in Hever, and see Holy land plainly.

From Holy land to Small deep or Ameren northnortheast, and somewhat
easterlyer, and southsouthwest and somewhat southerlyer 11 leagues. From Holy
land to Silt haven or List the course is north and by east distant 19 leagues.
From Holy land to Knuyts deep or Reper deep north, and north and by east 25
leagues. From Holy land to the Horn or Dodenbergh north and south 32 leagues.
From Knuyts deep or from the Island Phanu to the Vlie southwest and by south 51
leagues. From the Island of Silt to the Vlie n. e. and s. w. 47 leagues.
Here follows the Card N. 22.
CHAPTER III. A TRVE DESCRIPTION of the situation of the Seacoasts and Havens
of Iutland, from Dodenbergh till you come about Schaghen.
I. Of the situation of the Horn and of the Reefshorne.
RIght north from Doden-bergh lies the point called the Horn, Horn.
between Suyder-side and Wester-side, which there makes a Horn of the land:
for there southward the land reaches eastsoutheast and westnorthwest to the
Grouwe deep, but there northerly it reaches north and south to Westerside.
Westerside is a village between Blawenbergh and the Horn.

About this point or Horn there runs off a long banck, at least 12 leagues
about westsouthwest into the Sea, called Reefshorne, Reefshorne.
or as some say the Devils horn. This banck in some places lies all dry,
specially seven or eight leagues into the Sea, where this banck is no deeper
then two and an half or three fathom a foot less, a ship that sayleth upon
it, may sometimes be seen just from the land, but by the land it is at the
deepest, Depth upon Reefshorne.
that is four fathom a foot less. He that comes there with a ship that
goes deep must take heed thereof, for this Banck on the northwest side is so
shoring, that a man at one cast of the lead has 22 fathom, the second cast 15
fathom, and the third cast 3 fathom.

But it is an assured thing, when you are on the west side, or north from the
Reefshorne, then you may sound along by the wall at 6 or 7 fathom, till you
come by the said Horn, but then you shall find a dry sand, which runs off
from the land called the Uyl, The Owl
which northward is very shoring, you may go no nearer north unto it then
seven fathom. Right southward there begins Reefshorne to run off from the
land, and there it is a small banck, Depth upon Reefshorne by the land.
there you shall for certain find but three fathom, or three fathom a foot
less, for two or three casts with the lead, as the wind blows, and as you
go forward, for presently again you have five fathom, sound then forward
about by that dry sand, where you desire to be, as I told you before.

According to some men's opinions, Dogghers sand begins from this banck: for
as a man early in the morning sets sail out of Rincopers haven, with a
southwest course, and a good northeast wind, then you are about three or four
of the clock in the afternoon, yet at nine fathom, whereby it may partly
appear, that Dogghers sand should have her first beginning from this banck,
and the rather, for that Dogghers sand lies there abouts.

To know the land heereabouts, To know the land.
you must understand, that about four leagues north from the said Horn, there
lies a high hill called Blawebergh, which on both sides goes plainly sloping
down, it is somewhat blacker then the other land, and overgrowne with heath,
and lies a little from the strand. And southward from this Blauwebergh, as I
said before, the fishers village called Westerside lies: and betweepe that
village and the Horn lies a black hillock, also a Gentleman's house, otherwise
it is altogether hilly ground.

Thus the land shows between the Horn or Dodenbergh, and Numans haven.

Blauwebergh. Dodenbergh.

II. To sail into Numans chanel or Rincopers haven.
NOrth from the aforesaid Blauwebergh there lie three or four low downs, and
by Numans chanel or haven there lie two great sand hills close by each other.
To know Numans chanel.
North from these Sand hills Numans haven runs in, and the land between
Numans haven and the Dodenbergh reaches for the Ware afbeeldinge der

If you will sail into Rincopers haven To sail into Rincopers haven.
or the chanel of Numan, then go along by the land of Westerside at six or
seven fathom, til you come to the two aforesaid great white downs, then you
shall see two beacons stand, whereof each has a barrel upon it, on the north
side of the haven, upon a low land, bring them one against an other, then they
will stand north, or north and by east from you, and there you shall find a
tonne, unless it be laid otherwise. But right before the chanel of Numan lies
a sandy flat called Glad Iaep: Glad Iaep.
if you will sail into the south chanel, then leave this flat on baghborde,
and run in close by the south side or foot strand, whereon the said downs
lie, to the beacons, for there you can have no hurt, for you may sound them
easily, and that is the most assured course to sail in by the strand, if you
look well to your lead. When you are past by Glad Iaep, then ru^ne to the
north side whereon the said beacons stand, for you must there sail about them,
as close as you will: it is a low plain point, very fair and altogether
steeping. Now when you are within this point, you may anckor there where you
will. This haven from without reaches in most north, and north and by east,
until you are within the Glad Iaep, then you must go somewhat easterlyer to
the point aforesaid, it is a haven that has a good stream, because there
lies so great a chanel within it, but it flows there but little up and down,
not above two foot and an half, with a daily tide. A southwest and northeast
moon makes there high water.

North-chanel.
Right north from Glad Iaep there runs another chanel in, but there is but
eight foot water in it.

When you are within Numen haven, then forward it is Pilots water, To sail
from Numit chanel to Rincopen.
but ships that go not deep, they may well sail up, unles it be at a low
water. The depth runs by Numits strand, and when you keep Numits strand,
whereon the beacons stand, then you can not go amiss: but as soon as you put
off from thence, then you may sail under the sands or sheares, which reach off
from the Wadt to the land of Numit, therefore run so long close by the strand
of Numit, Marks of the Sands.
till a church with a flat steeple (which stands about east from you, against
the high land of the Holme) comes on the south side of the high land, then
you are within the sands and outsands, then you must leave the strand, and go
in n. n. e. and n. e. and by n. till there comes a round hillock close south,
or right over against a blewe church, which stands upon the high land of the
Holme, then go in northeast and by east, till the aforesaid blewe church
comes against a Gentleman's house, which stands below close by the water,
in the low land, then sail north and north and by east, till you be before
Rincopen, for there it is wide and broad. The right depth there is two fathom
and two foot. Rincopen and the haven of Numen lie distant from each other four
leagues.

North from Rincopen there runs a River into the land, whereon there lie two
small towns, the one called Hostebro, Hostebro.
the other Huysbuy, Huys buy.
they lie at least seven or eight leagues into the land.

Half a league south from Bovenberghen there goes another small haven out of
the Sea inward, it is called Trosmond. Trosmond chanel.
There stand two masts, which you must hold one over against the other, and so
go in, within it there lies a village called Trosmond, from thence you may
sail over the Wadt to Rincopen.

This haven or chanel is sometimes closed up, and sometimes again botes or
crayers and small ships may go out of and into it, but it is reckoned for no
haven.

III. Of the situation of Bovenberghen and the Holmen.
FRom Rincoper haven or the haven of Numan, to Bovenberghen, the land reaches
most north and south 10 leagues, and between them both it is all over a fair
strand, with white downs, which are overgrowne with heath, when you sail
along by it, then you may see the blewe within the land of Rincopen called
Holmes, above over this land.

Between Bovenberghen and Reefshorne Banks between Reefshorn and
Bovenberghen.
there lie some bancks, of 7, 8, and 9 fathom, and some that are deeper.

Bovenberghen Bovenberghen.
is a long plain hill, in the middle having a round hillock or hill, and upon
this hill stands a church with a steeple, you may see the land at 13 and 14
fathom. But if you come upon Bovenberghen to land, then it opens in three
hills, it is a shoring steep point, the middlemost hill is the highest,
whereon stands the church aforesaid, with a flat steeple, and on both sides
of this hill there stand other churches, which are not so high. You may see the
land at 13 or 14 fathom. The ground is great read sand, with some small
stones therein.

From Bovenberghen to the Holmen the land reaches north northeast 9 or 10
leagues, but it lies in a Creek, and it is black hillockie downish land,
overgrowne with heath, and there stands now and then a flat steeple in the
land. And there lies a banck of 10 fathom about five leagues from the land,
but it continues not long.

Iutland Sand.
Between Bovenberghen and the Holme, from thence the Sand reaches off from the
land west into the Sea, and when you go over that Sand, at 12 and 13 fathom,
then the Neus lies from you northwest and by north 24 leagues.

The Holmes Holmes.
is a plain point, which on the northeast side goes shoring down, and in the
middle upon this hill, there stands a apiece church without a steeple.
When that height of the land is southsoutheast from you, and that you may
justly see the north end, then it is 15 fathom deep, great rough sand, with
some stones amongst it. A stony banck north from Holmes.
There lies a banck of stone (like the Trindle of Lesou) two leagues northeast
or somewhat easterlyer from the north point of the Holmes, that is between the
north and the east points, so that the two third parts of the water is almost
between this stone-banck and the north point, and the other third part
between the east point and the said stone-banck, and there is not above 12
foot water upon it, there has some ships bin cast away upon it. This east
point East point
lies about four leagues eastward from Holmes, and is also a high shoring or
sloping point, as if it were Holmes. Right against this east point there
shoots a Sand half a league into the Sea, which you may sound about at seven
fathom, but as some say you may go through between the land and this Sand.

Thus the land between Bovenberghen and the Holmes shows, when you sail
along by it two leagues from the land.

III. The situation of the Coasts of Iutland, from the Holmes to Schaghen.
FRom the Holmes to Robbeknuyt the course is northeast nine leagues. And right
west from Robbeknuyt, in the creek to the east point, there stand five
churches with flat steeples, which stand nearest to Robbeknuyt, there lie also
two blewe lands between the East-point and Robbeknuyt, and there the land
lies in a Creek, and chere also you see a cloven hill or down before you
come to Robbeknuyt. It is there all along flat strand. East from Holmes there
goes in a water called Misdorp, Misdorp.
and right west from the white Cliffe of Robbeknuyt there also runs in a
little River whereon there lies a town called Werlom. Werlom.


Robbeknuyt is a high round hill, and right upon the height of the hill there
stands a church with a sharp steeple. To know Robbeknuyt.
But east about from this point there goes a great Creek about to Hartshals.
Against Robbeknuyt it is very far flat, for fifteen fathom depth is at
least two leagues from the land. And about four leagues from the land there
lies a banck of nine fathom, which reaches along by the land. And against
Robbeknuyt there lies a stone or rock about a league from the land.

From Robbeknuyt to Hartshals Hartshals.
it is southwest and by west four leagues. The land as I said before reaches
that way with a creek or bowing, and there stands a flat steeple between
them both, but nearest to Robbeknuyt, and there you see the high land of
Laclowe over that high land.

Hartshals is a long plain hill, To know Hartshals.
on the east end going somewhat shoring down. And right against Hartshals
there lies a sandy or stony ground, about a quarter of a league from the
land, whereon some men say many ships have been cast away, but it is little
used.

From Hartshals to Schaghen the course is eastnortheast eight leagues. The land
east from Hartshals is altogether downie and hillockie land, you may see the
high land of Laclowe beyond it, and you find along upon these Coasts, no such
plain hills as Bovenberghen, Holmes, Hartshals, and Robbeknuyt. A little way
within the point of Schaghen there stands a flat church with a flat steeple,
when this church is southsoutheast from you, then there runs a Sand or Flat
off from the land, and there you must put somewhat off from the land, otherwise
it is all shoring strand between Hartshals and Schaghen; but you may sound
that Sand about at six or seven fathom.

Upon the east end of the outmost of Schaghen there stands a fire beacon, as
if it were a sand beacon, and when the church is southwest and by west from
you, then the fire beacon and the steeple are one against the other, and then
you are right against the Sand of Schaghen, Marks of Schaghen sand.
which reaches off from the point eastnortheast, and east and by north almost
a league into the Sea. When you go along by the land, and go under it at five
or six fathom, then you may sound the Sand: but coming south out of the Sea,
you can hardly found it, for it is shoring, and then come no nearer unto it
then 12 or 13 fathom.

To know by sure marks when you are past this Sand, Marks to know that you
are past the Sand.
as well over the one side as the other, then mark that as you come out of the
west, and the old church and the fire beacon are one against the other, then
you come upon the west side of the Sand: but when you come out of the south or
the east, and that old church is against or within the south end of the
village, then you are upon the south side of the Sand. When the steeple and the
fire beacon are southwest and by west from you, then they are one against the
other, and then you are against the Sand, as I said before: and when the
steeple is southwest, and southwest and by south from you, then you are without
or west from the Sand: but when the steeple or fire beaco^ is westsouthwest,
and west and by south from you, then you are within the Sand. This you may by
night take by your compass, and mark it so, to see whether you be within or
without the Sand, when the fire lighter makes a clear bright fire. You may
set well on both sides of the Sand, so that you may put off from it at 7 or 8
fathom.

Some say that upon necessity a man might go between this Sand and the land
at two fathom and an half.

About two leagues without Schaghen toward Hartshals, Bancks between Schaghen
and Hartshals.
two leagues from the land there lies a banck of 10 or 12 fathom, and within
this banck it is 16, 17, and 18 fathom deep.

Between Schaghen and Masterland or Norwaie it is all soft ground, and the
nearer to Norwaie the deeper water, but when you come out of the Sond, and are
in the chanel, and find no ground at 18, 20, and 22 fathom, it is a sign
that you are about Schaghen Sand.

When you come out of the west about Schaghen, and will go to the Sond or to
the Belt, then take heed of the stream out of the Belt, Of the stream out of
the Belt.
for commonly it falls out of the Belt toward Norwaie, specially when the
wind has blown a while east or northeast, this stream by night or in dark
wether will carry you under Norwaie before you are aware thereof, therefore be
careful thereof, and guess accordingly.

Thus the land between the Holmes and Schaghen shows, when you sail along
by it.

CHAPTER IIII. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Belt, VVedersond, and Melversond, and of
all the Islands lying thereabouts.
I. The situation of Lezou and the Trindle, and how you shall sail from
Schaghen to Seebuy
FRom Schaghen sand to Lezou the course is s. s. e. eight leagues. The
situation of Lesou.
Lesou is a foul Island, which is round about flat, and compassed about with
many banckes, and sands shooting out. At the south end it is but two fathom
deep, above two leagues from the land, and from the south end whereon the
church stands there shoots a Sand into the Sea, two leagues and an half,
which you may anckor under safe against a s. s. e. wind. Also on the other
side of the south end there shoots off a sand, so that when the aforesaid
flat church is east, and northeast from you, there you cannot see the land when
you are within a league of it: but you may go so near to the north end, that
you may lie at anckor under it safe against a south wind, at 3 4 and 5
fathom. From the north end also there shoots off a sand to the Trindle, but
you may sound it about at three or four fathom, through between Lesou and the
Trindle.

Trindle.
The Trindle lies northeast, or somewhat northerlyer from the northende of
Lesou about two great leagues, and from Schaghen sand southeast and northwest
eight leagues. It is stony sand ground, about 4 foot deep, and about six or
seven akers of land great, reaching along by the chanel of the Sea: On the
north side always there lies a tonne, whereby men may know it a far off.
You may sail well through between Lesou and the Trindel, and the nearer to
the Trindel the deeper water, and the nearer to Lesou the flatter and
shallower. Close by the Trindle it is 5 or 6 fathom deep.

Zeebuy.
But to sail from Schaghen to Seebuy, the right course is south and by west 7
leagues. When Schaghen lies about n. w. and by w. from you, and that you are a
league from it, there it is 17 and 18 fathom deep: and when Schaghen is west,
and west and by south a league, or a league and an half from you, there it is
34. or 35 fathom deep. And come no nearer to Schaghen by night then 14 or 15
fathom. Now when you will sail from Schaghen to Seebuy, then you go by the
small Helmes, Small Helmes.
lying south and by west 4 leagues from Schaghen, and if you will go into the
Belt, then you leave them on starborde, going all south and by west to Zeebuy.
And he that will anckor under the Helmes, Rode under the Helmes.
coming off from Schaghen, he must run to the land at three fathom, and
run in between the strand and the Helmes, until he be within the rocks,
there you may anckor or go through at three fathom, along by the foot strand,
and when the rocks of Helmes are east, and east and by north from you, there
is the Rode, at four and four fathom and an half.

The Helmes are three Islands, the southerlyest the Iutters call the Dien or the
Dee, the middlemost Holmes, and the northerlyest the Grasholme, and by it there
lies another little Island. You may sail through between the southerlyest and
the middlemost, but nearest to the southerlyest Island: there is between them
four fathom water. The best Rode to lie in for little ships behind the Helmes,
is between the middlemost and the southerlyest Island, a little nearer the ferme
land then the Islands, but for great ships the best lying is by the Grasholme.

Between the Holmes and the ferme land in the faire-water, it is at the least
three fathom deep.

When you come on the south end of the rocks, there runs a Sand off from
the Helmes to the strand, Sand of the Helmes
called Boutferriffe or sand, where the great stones lie upon the strand, but
keeping at three fathom you can do no hurt upon this sand, and you may so go
out again at the south end of Zeebuy.

A league east from Helmes there lies a heap of stones which you must beware
of, when you will go into the Belt.

A ship that goes not deep may sail round about the Helmes, for there at
the least it is three fathom water. In the chanel between the Helmes, and the
north end of Lesou it is 10 fathom deep soft ground, Depth between the
Helmes and Lesou.
and before Zeebuy in the rode it is 4 and 5 fathom deep. Lesou lies about
four leagues from Zeebuy. On the west side of Lesou lie the Dwalegrounds, which
lie north from the aforesaid Sand (which shoots off west into the Sea, from
the south end of Lesou, whereon the flat church stands. These Dwalegrounds
are very uneven, of 3, 4, 5, and 6 fathom deep, and within Zeebuy there are
also flat grounds of 4, 5, and 6 fathom. The chanel between the Dwalegrounds
and the flattes of Zeebuy is seven and eight fathom deep.

II. To sail from Zeebuy to Aelborgh and Stevenshooft.
To sail into Aelburgher chanel or haven.
FRom Zeebuy to Aelburgher chanel the course is south and by west 7 leagues. On
the north side of the chanel there stands a flat steeple called Hals, in the
chanel there lies a tonne, and upon the south land there stand two capes,
which you must bring one against the other, and then you find the tonne. The
haven first reaches in w. and by s. about a cables length, then you go n. w.
and by w. right up to Hals, and go in by the north side till you be against
Hals, for from the south point of the land there comes a Flat shooting off,
which you must shun: being against Hals, you must then go s. w. and by w. to
the bocht or hollow ground, and in the crooking you must shun the north side
somewhat, then go northwest and by west again along to the second crooking,
then s. s. w. and then w. s. w. to the town. Before in the haven at the to^ne
it is two fathom deep, and there within a little while after five or six
fathom: but to sail into it it is best to take a Pilot. By the south side
also there goes in a chanel of 6 or 8 foot deep.

The town of Aelburgh lies four leagues upwards in the River, within the
land: also west along by these Coasts there lie some bancks, there you must
shun the land somewhat.

When you sail from the Helmes to Stevenshooft, through between the
Dwalegrounds and the Flats of Zeebuy, then you find flat grounds about half
way between Stevenshooft and Zeebuy of 5, 6, and 7 fathom. This shallowe is
called the Sweteringh, The Sweteringh.
lying above two leagues eastward from Aelburgher haven, and the chanel there
between them both is about 10 or 11 fathom deep.

From Aelburgher haven to Haselin the course is southeast and by east about
twenty leagues.

From Aelburgher haven to Stevenshooft Stevenshooft.
the course is s. e. and by s. about nine leagues. There between them both the
land lies in a great Creek, wherein the two towns called Mariacker and
Randersen do lie. Mariacker Mariacker
lies from Aelburgher haven south, and south and by west four leagues, and
from Stevenshooft five leagues. Between Mariacker and Stevenhoofr lies the
River of Randersen, Randersen
which runs crooked about so far up into the land, to the town of
Schandelburgh, where the King of Denmark has a great fishing, and also many
times comes there to hunt.

Thus the land and the church of Aelst shows two leagues and an half east
from Aelburgher haven.

Aelster church. Melver hill.

view of 'Aelst' (Denmark)

III. To sail from Stevenshooft to the Islands of Syro, Wero, and Sampso, and
forth through the Wedersond to the Melversond.
FRom Stevenshooft to Haselin the course is e. s. e. thirteen leagues, and
Haselin Haselin.
without is full of foul Sands and grounds: you shall find further and larger
description of Haselin and Anout, as also of the foul ways and shallowes
lying thereabouts in the tenth Chapter of this Book.

Right south from Stevenshooft lies a little town called Oruntbuy, there lie
the Chalck grounds right before the River of Grimsond in a Creek, right about
the point of Stevenshooft, Oruntbuy Chalk-grounds.
that is a sand two or three foot water deep, but not far from it, it is 10
fathom deep, you may sound it at 4. fathom. You may sail up the Grimsond
Grimsond.
to Grimsteed, which is a lading place of Boeyers.

From Stevenshooft to Great Helmes Great Helmes.
the course is s. s. w. about 7 leagues. The land from Stevenshooft to the
point of Ebeltud reaches s.s.w. seven or eight leagues. Ebeltud Ebeltud.
is a little town lying against the Great Helmes inward to the land. Between
the Great Helm and Iutland it is 6 and 7 fathom deep. Close by Stevenshooft
and the point of Ebeltud it is 8, 9, and 10 fathom deep. The great Helm has
two Sands, one upon the north side, and the other upon the south side.

From Stevenshooft to Siero Siero.
the course is s. s. e. 8 leagues. North from Siero lies a land-losse ground
divided into two Sands, Sands of Siero.
which you must shun.

These two Sands in some places lie above the water.

From the Great Holme to the Island Wero The Island Wero
the course is n. n. w. and s. s. e. four leagues, and there it is 4 or 5
fathom deep.

The situation of Kayholme and Samps
From Wero there runs a shallowe to Kayeholme, and about Kayholme: and also
about the Islands Samps, it is all full of dry grounds, and they run all to
the great Island Sampso.

From Great Holme to the Island Sampso Sampso.
it is s. w. and n. e. four leagues.

Sand of Sampso.
From the north end of Sampso there shoots off a Sand north into the Sea,
there you may sound close about, to come into the Rode of Sampso, when you will
anckor there, there at the Rode it is 10 fathom, and under the Swan grounds
you lie safe from all winds.

From the south end of Ebeltud to Aerhuysen Aerhuysen
the course is west, and west and by south five leagues, there it is all flat
water, that is 2 and 3 fathom deep. He that will anckor in the Rode before
Aerhuysen, let him bring the great steeple in the middle between the two other
speeres, there is the best ground, and good Rode at 3, 4, or 5 fathom, so dry
as one will.

South by Aerhuysen the Wedersond Wedersond.
goes in, between Iutland and Sampso: he that will sail into it must be well
acquainted there with, for there it is all full of Sands and shallowes, and
also by night you can not use the chanel, because of the sands and shallowes,
and by day also you must look well about you, and spare not your lead, but
you may anckor and lie at rode there all over. When you will sail through the
Wedersond, To sail through Wedersond.
coming from Great Holme or Ebeltud, then leave the Island Tons Tons.
and the Swan grounds on baghborde, running forth all along by the coast of
Iutland at 2 or 3 fathom, till you be past Horsens, or the Island of Endelau,
which Island of Endelau a man may not go near unto on the west side, because
of all the grounds which lie on the west side thereof.

Between Endelau Endelau.
and the firm land it is narrow water, stretching from Wedersond south
through the Swan grounds, Swan-grounds.
on both sides it is dry, it is but a chanel to sail through.

When you come off from Melversond, and will sail through the Wedersond, it is
best to run along by the Iutland side, till you be against the River of
Horsens, there you must then put somewhat off from the land, and sail upon the
I Will of Tons, then you go through between the North and South grounds, leaving
the I Will of Tons on starborde. When you are past Tons, then you must go out
close by the north point of Sampso, to the land of Ebeltud, it is altogether
one course from Horsens to Tons, and forth to Sampso, and the point of Ebeltud,
that is, altogether northeast and southwest 8 or 9 leagues.

From Horsens or the Island Endelau to Melversond Melversond.
the course is s. s. w. 7 leagues. Melversond is a deep Sond, of 20 and 25
fathom, and is very crooked to go in. It goes in between Fuynen and
Iutland, which are two high lands.

From the Island Ebelo to Melversond the course is southwest and southwest and
by south five leagues.

From Sampso Rode to the I Will of Ebelo Ebelo.
the course is s. s. w. and s. w. and by w. five leagues. And from the south
end of Sampso to Ebelo the course is s. w. and by w. four leagues.

From Sampso to Roems Roems.
the course is s. e. and n. w. 5 leagues.

The northwest Coast of Fuynen reaches southwest and by west 8 leagues. The
Island of Ebelo lies a league from it, yet you cannot go through between it
and Fuynen, it lies right before Bowens. South from the Island there lies a
great stone or rock under the water, between this Rock and the Island lies the
Rode before Bowens, Rode before Bouwens.
at 8 or 9 fathom.

IIII. To sail from Syro and Wero to Langheland, and forth about Fuynen to
Melversond, also along by Zeland to Golversond.
Between Syro and Wero lies a bad sand, long and broad, Haters Sand.
reaching further then half way to Siero. When you will sail through between
the two Islands aforesaid, above Russenesse, you must leave two third parts of
the water lying on Wero side, and go in s. s. w. and s. and by w. to Roems,
that is nine leagues.

The said sand is called Haters sand, and it is on the east side it is very
hard and stony, and if you come from Boltsack you must run close by the
Island of Wero, to shun the Sand, the chanel between the sand and Wero is not
to broad, but it is three and three fathom and an half deep.

He that comes eastward of Wero through between Wero and Haters sand, and
will sail to Roems, let him go right south by east, and so he shall ru^ne
about a quarter of a league eastward of Boltsack, and fall right east from
Roems. In like manner he that goes from Roems or a little east of it, north and
by west he falls between Wero and Haters Sand right in the fairewaie. One
may run through between Roems and Fuynen at two fathom, but you cannot go
through there with great ships. From the north end of Fuynen there shoots
off a Sand at least a quarter of a league into the Sea. Within Roems in the
land of Fuynen there lies a little town to lade at, which is called Cartmond,
Cartemonde.
there commonly lie two tonnes in the haven, you may sail in by them: the
haven goes in east, on the west side it is flat, the tonnes lie along by the
flats, and in sailing up you leave them on starborde: this haven is 12 foot
deep.

From Romps to Spro Spro.
or Knuytshooft Knuytshooft.
the course is s. and by e and s. s. e. five leagues. Between Siero and
Knuytshooft it is 12 and 13 fathom deep, but between Romps and Siero it is
10 or 11 fathom deep.

Right south about the point of Knuytshooft in Fuynen lies the Haven of
Nyburgh, Nyburgh.
when you are about the point, then you go close up to the town, about a
league northwestward it is 6 or 7 fathom deep, you lie there with your ship
at the Kaye, and have any thing carried aborde that you will.

From Knuytshooft to Langheland the course is s. e. four leagues, and then you
leave Spro on baghborde, from the southeast end of Spro there shoots off a
Sand which you must shu^ne.

At the northende of Langheland lie the Islands of Frissel, Frissel.
which are very foul round about.

From Knuytshooft to the Island of Tassingh the course is s. 4 leagues: you must
leave Frissel on the left hand, and you must run through between Frissel and
Fuynen. If you will go to Swinburgh, Swin. burgh.
then from Frissel go to the southeast end of Fuynen s. s. w. and you shall
come to an Island, where you may go about on both sides, through between
Tassingh and the Island, or you may run along by the land of Fuynen, till you
come to the town of Swinburgh, which lies over against the Island of Tassingh,
and against the point of Fuynen there lies an Island called Olmes, Olmes.
then you must strike up westward. You may also go about on the other side of
Tassingh, and leave the Island Arr, and the foul grounds that lie between Arr
and the southeast end of Fuynen on baghborde. Upon those Grounds it is not
above 6 foot deep. And when you come by the Island of Olmes or the southeast
point of Fuynen, then (as aforesaid) you must strike up westward, about the
point of Fuynen to Woburgh. On the south side of these Grounds aforesaid there
goes also a chanel through, which goes west and west and by south, between
the Grounds and the Island of Arr. In this Island of Arr there is a town called
Copingh. Copingh.
This foul ground is 2 leagues long, and the Island of Arr is also two leagues
long, both of them reach east and west, and Monk Island Monk Island.
lies at the end of these grounds, in Fuynen before Woburgh: it has two
Sands, the one comes from the southeast end, and shoots east into the Sea,
the other comes from the north point, and reaches northeast into the Sea.
But when you sail north from these grounds, that is, between Fuynen and these
grounds to Woburgh, then you go upon the said I Will of Monk, and an Island or
two more, which you must leave on the left hand, and run all along by the
land of Fuynen, about w. and w. and by n. to the point of Askens, Askens.
which is about five leagues from the southeast point.

From the east point of Askens to the Island Areu and Toreu, Areu and Toreu.
the course is w. and by n. and w. n. w. above 2 leagues. These two Islands lie
one over against the other, the one on Iutland, the other on Fuynen land, and
you must go through between two Sands, which run one against the other, and
there it is 4 or 5 fathom deep.

North or west from Areu the chanel of Haddersleu Haddersleu.
begineth, and reaches in about w. and by s. upon it lies the town of
Haddersleu, which is above two leagues within the land.

From Areu or Toreu to Melversond the course is n. n. w. 5 leagues, which you
go into southward: first you go westward in to the chanel of Coldinghen,
Coldinghen.
which is a wide chanel, which goes about a league into the land, when you
will go through Melversond, then you leave it on the left hand, and go up
eastward to the town of Melver, To sail through Melversond.
where you come again into the crooked. Melversond goes out northward, with a
great crooking, and then you must go out again into the broad water north
from Fuynen, as I taught you before.

You may also sail out from Areu or Aelsche chanel s. s. w. to Apenrade,
Apenrade.
and so behind about the Island of Aelsens till you come into the chanel of
Flensburgh.

To turn again to the Belt: it is from Rosnes Rosnes.
n. n. w. going west from Syro. From Rosnes shoots a Sand off to seaward, but
a little east from Rosnes, that is, from the point which lies half way at
Haselin, there reaches a Sand off, above a league and an half into the Sea,
that lies at the end quite dry, you may boldly run about close by the
dry, for not far from it it is eight fathom deep.

From Rosnes to Spro south and north 8 or 9 leagues. Between Rosnes and Spro
lies Callenburgh Callenburgh.
in Zeland, which also is a lading place, and about two leagues south from
Callenburgh shoots a flat along the Coast, about three quarters of a league
from the strand of five fathom deep.

From the east end of Spro shoots a stony banck off, and over against it
comes a Flat shooting off from the land, there between them it is 4 and 5
fathom deep. But behind or against Spro lies Cassuer, Cassuer.
a fair Haven, where also lying at the Kaye you may have your goods carried
into the ship.

From Spro to Langheland the course is s. e. and by s. four leagues. Right
against Langheland lies Golbersond, whereof I will speak in the Chapter
following.

V. How these places lie distant from each other, and also from other Countries.
ALthough in the description of this Card of the Belt from Schaghen to
Langheland, most part of the reachings of the land from one place to another is
set down, yet I thought it requisite to set and place them here in order one
after the other, as I have done in the rest of the descriptions, and the
rather, for that I think it will be profitable for Sailors, when men (having
them all together by themselves) may the readier and sooner find such
stretchings as they desire to see.

From Schaghen to Lesou s. s. e. 8 leagues. From Schaghen to the Trindle s. e.

Here follows the Card N. 24.
CHAPTER V. A DECLARATION HOW you shall sail forth through the Belt to
Femeren, and along by the Coasts of Holst, Mechelenburgh and Pomerland: Also
the situation of Laland, Falster, Borneholme, and the places lying there abouts.
I. The situation of the Golversond, of Laland, Falster, and Meun so far as
to Steden.
THe Island of Langheland is about eight leagues long, and reaches south and
north, there east against it lies the Golversond, which reaches in north from
Laland, and reaches all up to Nestvelt, and Wordenburgh, and comes into the
Greensond, and in that Wolf-chanel or Wolve-gat goes into the East-sea again.
Before Golversond there lie three Islands: the one called Wedero, which lies at
the point of Laland, and is fast to it by a Sand, so that you may not sail
through between them, there northward you go into Golversond, To sail into
Golversond.
leaving it on starborde. The other two lie north from the said Island of
Wedero: the first whereof is called Arnis, and the other Ooms. Ooms is a little
plain Island, but Arnis is the greatest, it lies nearest Zeland, and is full
of trees. From the Island Ooms a Sand stretches off southwest to seaward, which
is at least a league long, and at the end flat, that you may run over with
the lead, and when you will sail into Golversond you must let these two Islands
lie on baghborde of you. The Island Laland at the west point, The Sand of Laland.
over against the south end of Langheland has a Sand or Hook, which reaches
off from Laland half over the Belt: to shun it, you must run along a
quarter of a league east from Langheland: Marks of Lalands Riffe or Sand.
or if you leave two third parts of the water on Lalands side, and the other
third part on Langhelands side, then also you shall not sail upon it. When you
come out of the south and will go into the Belt, and that then the steeple of
Mascou, which stands upon Laland, comes to be northeast and by east from
you, then you are past that sand, and it lies south from you. In this chanel
between Laland and the south end of Langheland it is six and seven fathom
deep.

From the south end of Langheland to Femeren the course is southeast and by
east seven leagues.

Now when you come off from Langheland, and have past the Sand or Hook of
Laland, the South coast of Laland reaches there east and west. There lies a
long Sand along, which is called the Redde-sand, Tha Red-sand.
and reaches out till it comes before Golversond, which runs in between
Laland and Gester. North from this Sand there is a Rode of sixteen and
eighteen foot water, before the towns of Aelholme Aelholme.
and Robuy, Robuy.
where you may lade nuttes and barley.

Between Laland and Gester against this Read sand (as I said) the Golversond
goes in, you may there go into it, and come out again into the Belt: but in
this chanel there is small depth, for there lies a stone-bancke within cross
over the chanel: in it there lies a town called Nicopen, Nicopen.
which lies upon the Island of Falster a league within Gester.

From Gester Gester-sand Gester-sand.
shoots off, at least two leagues into the Sea, it is a dry Sand. East from
Gester-sand lies an Island called Bout, Bout.
and there it is all flat or shallowe water at 3 or 4 fathom.

East from Bout Gronesond Gronesond.
goes in, it goes there through the land, by the town of Stuybekuyp,
Stuybekuyp.
and comes north by Laland again into the Belt. Gronesond reaches in about
west and west and by north at threefathome, there lies a Sand on the left hand
of the haven, called the Tolck, Tolck.
which you must shun, you must there go in east, you may go in by the land
of Meun, at fourteen or sixteen foot water, the said town of Beschrijvinghe
vant zuijder deel vande Belt, en hoemen de Custen van Mekele^borch Pomeren, met

map of the coasts of Germany and Denmark Stuybekuyp lies about a league
inward.

From Gestersand to Meun Meun.
the course is northnortheast eight leagues, but from Bout to Meun it is
northeast about seven leagues.

Rode under Meun.
From Golversond to Meun the land lies in a Creek, there you anckor safe
against a northeast, north, northwest and west winds at five or six fathom.
If you come out of the Sond and will go south from Meun, you may go as near
Meun as you will, and loose westward up by the point, and anckor where you will
at 5 or 6 fathom.

On the north side of Meun you may also anckor at six fathom, behind a Sand
which shoots off from the northpoint, against an east, south, southwest, and
west winds, it is there all flat and good ground.

From Meun to Steden Steden.
it is northwest and by north four leagues. Between them both the Wolfsond, or
the Wolf chanel goes in, Wolfs chanel.
it runs by Werdenburgh and Nestvelt, and through the Golversond out at the
Belt.

II. To sail from Melversond out of the Aelse to Langheland.
MElversond and the Island of Areu are distant southsoutheast and northnorthwest
as I said in the Chapter before.

To sail from Areu to Melversond out of the chanel of Aelsche, then go from
Areu or Toreu to Roen east and by south above two leagues, and so forth
between the Island and Fuynen, that is north along by the Roen, for you can not
go south by it. The Roen The Roen.
is a badde shallowe Sand, which shoots off from Aelsen, where it is fast,
and the outtermost end lies dry, as if it were Anoulter Sand.

From Roen to Arr or Copingh the course is southeast and by east five leagues.

From the southeast end of Aelst there shoots off a great Sand to Arr, which
is called the Poelsche Sand, Poelsche Sand.
you must run between Arr and the Sand, and leave two parts of the water on
the Aelsche side, and one part toward Arr, and run so upon the south end of
Langheland, until you come against Copen.

From Arr to the southende of Langheland the course is southeast and by east,
and southsoutheast four leagues, and from the Poelsche sand to the south end
of Langheland the course is west and by south seven leagues.

You may run through between Langheland and Arr north about and come into
the Belt again by Nyburgh. From the south end of Langheland to Tassing it is
north and by west seven leagues. You may sail about Tassing on both sides, The
situation of Tassingh.
and leave Arre and the foul grounds sidewaies from you, upon the grounds it
is no deeper then six fathom.

Between the said grounds and Fuynen you may also run forward into the
Aelsche chanel, to the Islands of Areu and Toreu, as I said in the Chapter
before.

III. The situation from Areu off to Apenrade, Flensburgh, and so to Femeren.
FRom the I Will of Areu to Apenrade the course is southsouthwest five leagues:
the chanel or haven of Apenrade is an open wide chanel, Apenrade chanel.
and thereon lies the aforesaid town of Apenrade.

From the River of Apenrade to the crooking of Sonderburgh, which goes in
between the Island Aelsen and the firm land, the course is east two great
leagues: there you may sail through behind the Island of Aelsen about to
Sonderburgh, and so into the haven of Flensburgh.

Between the Island and the firm land it is very narrow and crooked, but
when you are through the narrow and crooked way, into the chanel of
Flensburgh, then it is wider and broader.

The chanel of Flensburgh Fle^sburgh chanel.
goes in between Sonderburgh and Holsterland, it is a wide chanel, if you
will sail into this chanel, you must take good heed of the Holster side, when
you begin to come between both the lands, and run in along by the land of
Aelst, for from Nubel or Holsterland the Chalck grounds Chalck grounds.
reach half over the chanel. This chanel reaches west and by south, till you
come before the River. Before upon the River there lies an Island, on the right
hand, there you must go in east, and run west and by south, and west, till
you come within the crooking of the River, and then you must go south up
again, then you may see the town of Flensburgh lie before you.

South from the chanel of Flensburgh there lie three Rivers or channels more,
where great ships may go in, that is, the Sleye, Nilhofvoert, and the Kiel:
from Flensburgh to the Kiel, the land reaches s. s. e, and somewhat easterlyer
7 leagues.

From Sonderburgh to the Sleye The Sleye.
the course is s. e. and by e. 4 leagues. This is a deep and wide chanel,
first reaching in about west, and when you are within, then it runs by
Sleeswick Sleeswick.
about s. e. and by w.: there also come many great ships out, the town of
Gottorp Gottorp.
also lies upon this River.

Between the Sleye and the Kiel lies Nihofvoert, Nilhofvoert.
and upon it there lies a town called Eckelenford.

The Haven of Kiel is a great wide haven, it reaches in about s. e. a great
ship may go into it. Kill haven


From Kiel to the west end of Femeren Femeren.
it is e. n. e. eight leagues.

From the Poelsche sand to Femeren over Colbergher Heyde, Colberger Heyde.
the course is e. s. e. 13 or 15 leagues, but from the south end of
Langhesand, it is s. e. and by e. seven leagues.

The chanel between Femeren and Laland is 5 or 6 fathom deep.

You may sail round about Femeren, there it is flat ground, you may run
through between Femeren and Holsterland, at 8 or 10 foot water, there lies a
town called Heyligher Haven, Heyliger haven.
where you may ancker with flat bottomed ships, to lade wheat or barley.

IIII. To sail from Femeren to Lubeck, and so forth along the Coast from
Mekelenburgh to the Ielle.
FRom the Island of Femeren to Gester Sand the course is e. and by n. about 11
leagues, but from Femeren to the Trave of Lubeck Trave of Lubeck.
it is s. s. w. eleven leagues. There goes in a good chanel for great ships,
and it is 12 foot deep upon the banck. There is also a great Creek and a good
Haven, where you may lie safe against al winds, except a n. e. and a n.n.e.
wind.

From the Trave of Lubeck to Gester sand, the course is n. e. and s. w. about
19 leagues.

From the Trave of Lubeck to Wismar haven the course is first n. e. and by e.
and then e. n. e. there goes in a good chanel for all kind of ships.

To sail into Wismare haven, To sail into Wismar haven
place the steeple which stands upon the south land south from you, and so
sail in, until the steeple standing on the east land by the easterly house be
against five or six houses, and by those houses stand some trees together,
from the east end there comes a Sand shooting off, and reaches n. w. and by
n. off from the east land, and when the steeple comes upon the houses, then
go in s. s. e, and in that deep it is 12 foot water. In the Somer there lie
two to^nes in the chanel: the one upon the point of the Sand, which comes
shooting off from the east land, and the other upon the the flat ground, and
you must run in through them both. This Wismare haven lies distant from
Femeren south and by east about 7 or 8 leagues, but from Wismare to Gester sand
the course is n. n. e. 12 or 13 leagues.

About south from Gester sand lies Rostock, Rostock.
and there also goes in a fair haven of ten foot deep, but it is very
flat on both sides, you may use it on both sides with the lead. Wismaer and
Rostock are distant about 8 or 9 leagues.

A little east from Rostock lies a high land called Robbenes, Robbenes
from it there reaches off a great Sand or flat to the Seaward, toward Gester
sand: between Gester sand and this Sand it is no deeper then 12 or 13 fathom:
if you go nearest to Gester sand, then it is presently dry: but if you go
nearest to this Sand, then it is sometimes drier. Gester sand as I said before
is a dry Sand, and runs at least two leagues into the Sea.

Right east from this Sand aforesaid lies Berts. Berts.
There goes in a chanel of six foot deep, and on the west point there
reaches off a Sand, which you must shun.

Three or four leagues east from Berts the Ielle goes in, To sail into the
Ielle.
at eight or ten foot deep, there you may go into Mesond or Straelsond, and
going into it you may see the steeple of Mesond lying before you, within it is
12 and 14 foot deep, altogether flat water.

When you sail to Lubeck, between the land of Cruysoort and Holsterland, it
shows thus on both sides.

Wismar. Great Cruysoort. Little Cruysoort. Holsterland. The East point.

Thus the Coast of Mekelenburgh, shows between Cruysoort and Dornebos or the
Ielle, when you sail along by it a league from the land.

V. The situation of Dornbos, Witmont, Iasmont, the Peert and New deep.
Thornebush.
THe point of Dornbos lies from Ielle north and by west a league and an half:
under it you may ancker and lie safe against a northeast and southwest wind.

From Dornebos to Witmont Witmont.
the course is northeast and by east four leagues. Between Dornebos and
Witmont there goes in a great Creek, you may there run into it along by
Witmont, and there anckor at five or six fathom, safe against a southwest and
east wind.

From Witmont to Iasmont Iasmont.
the course is eastsoutheast two great leagues. Between Witmont and Iasmont
you may also ancker, there also is a good Rode, at seven or eight fathom,
there you may lie safe against a west and south wind, but further from the
land, at ten or twelve fathom there is foul ground.

From Iasmont to the Peert The Peert.
the course is s. s. e. two leagues. Between Iasmont and the Peert one may
ride it against a west, southwest, and south wind, it is there all over fair
ground.

The Peert, (which is also called the Great Bocke upon Iasmont is a heap or
two of trees, and it is an out-point with two points or ends, and there
between them is a brave Sandbaye, where it is good lying at four five fathom
fair ground.

To sail into the New deep.
A league south from the Peert the New Deep goes in, right within the point
there lies a foul ground under the water, and somewhat inwards to the
southerlyest point lies a dry Sand. To sail into the New Deep, hold the
two points one over the other, that is the Peert on the souththerlyest point,
and hold it so standing, and so you shall sail right upon the first tonne:
since there former years there have three tonnes been laid in the middle of
the fair water, southsouthwest and northnortheast from each other. From the
third tonne to the beacon that stands upon the end of the Sand that shoots
off from the Roeden the course is southeast, by it you may go about, and
anckor behind the Island at five or six fathom. Or if you will go quite
within, then run upon the point of Gripswolde, and thereby you may then turn
up westwards to Mesond, or eastwards to Stetin. To Mesond and Stetin.
That chanel is about twelve foot deep, and within it is all flat, and for the
most part two or three fathom till you be before the town of Mesond or
Straelsond. There lies an Island, and there is the Veer to set over upon the
land of Ruyghen. The town of Gripswold Gripswold
lies in the entry right before you in the River.

The Coast of Pomeren reaches from the New Deep to Colsberghen east and by
north, and eastnortheast 16 or 17 leagues.

But between Colsberghen and the New Deep, there lie two Havens more: first
the Swin Swin.
lying from the New Deep seven leagues, it runs through with a River, up
to Haf, right over against the River of Stetin.

From the Swin to Camin it is eastnortheast five leagues: Camin Camin.
lies upon the east end of the Stetynsche Haf and goes also with a River to
Haf.

Thus Witmont shows when you sail by it being two leagues from the land.
view of 'Witmont' (Germany) Thus Iasmond shows when you sail by it, being
two leagues from the land.
view of 'Jasmond' (Germany)

VI. The situation of the Island of Borneholme and of the Ertholmes.
THe Island of Borneholme lies from the Newe-deepe, north and by east sixteen
leagues, but from Witmont northeast and by east twelve leagues.

From Valsterbon to sail north about Borneholme it is east and by north
nineteen leagues: but from Valsterbon to sail south about it is east and by
south one-and-twentie or two-and twenty leagues.

Borneholme.
Borneholme is an Island which is round about fair, and one may sound it round
about at twelve and thirteen fathom, and on the southwest side at eight or
nine fathom, without any danger: But on the southeast end there lies a
Sand called Brouwers sand, which you must shun. You may anckor round about
Bornholme, as before Rottum, Nex, Swanex and Santwick.

Between Rottum Rottum.
and the castle which stands upon the northwest point, you may anckor at
thirteen fathom, and there you lie safe against a northeast wind. You may
also anckor under the castle at eighteen or twenty fathom, but the nearer to
the land the fouler ground.

Under the northwest point before Santwick, there also it is good anckoring for
a southwest wind, and you may go boldly near to the point. From the
northwest point to the other point, the land reaches eastsoutheast and
westnorthwest.

On the east side of Borneholme it is good anckoring before Swanex and Nex,
Suanex and Nex.
but by Nex it is not very fair. By Nex there shoots off a Sand from the
land, which on both sides is shoring, but at ten fathom you can not
miscarie: there lies also a rock north from Nex.

If you will anckor before Nex, you must set the flat steeple, which stands
above Nex between west and west and by south from you, and let the north point
be north and by west, and the south point southsouthwest from you, there it is
about two-and twenty fathom deep, and it is there fair sand-ground, for in
many places it is nothing but stony and gravelie ground, there you lie safe
against a southwest wind.

From the southeast point of Borneholme to Ertholmes Eertsholmes.
it is north and by east five leagues, but from the northwest point to
Ertholmes it is eastnortheast four leagues. In the Ertholmes it is a fair
haven, but because it is not used, it is unknown.

Thus Borneholme shows when you come out of the west.
view of Bornholm When Eertsholmes is northnortheast from you, it shows thus.
view of 'Eertsholmes' (Denmark) When Eertsholme is east from you it shows
thus.

9 leagues. From the Trave of Lubeck to Gestir sand the course is northeast and
southwest about 19 leagues. From Wismar to Gestir sand n. n. e. 12 or 13
leagues. From Rostock to Gestir sand north 7 or 8 leagues. From Gestir sand to
Dornebosch east 9 leagues. From Dornebosch to Meun northwest 9 leagues. From
Dornebusch to Bornholme northeast and northeast and by east 16 leagues. From
Witmond to Borneholme northeast 13 leagues. From the New deep to Borneholme
north and by east 16 or 17 leagues. From Meun to Borneholme east 19 leagues.
From Steden to the north end of Borneholme is the course east and by north 20
leagues. From Valsterboen or from the sand north from Borneholme about, the
course is east and by north 19 leagues. From Valsterbon or from the sand south
from Borneholme a-about, the course is east and by south 21 leagues. From
Valsterbon to Iasmont southeast 16 or 17 leagues. How all the rest of the
points and Islands in the east Sea are distant from Borneholme, that shall you
find described in the next Chapter following.
Here follows the Card N. 25.
CHAPTER VI. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Pomerland and Prusia, from
Colberghen to Memle.
I. The situation between Colberghen and Righshooft..
THe New deep and Colberghen (as I said in the former Chapter) lie distant
east and north, and eastnortheast sixteen or seventeene leagues.

You must sail into the Haven of Colberghen Colberghen.
between two Heads, close before the town. Within the River of Colberghen,
right over against the town there lies a Pit or Well, which yields salt to
all the Countries there abouts, but they must sees it, yet the water of the
River is as fresh as milk, for it is an out-water.

The Coast of Pomerland reaches from Colberghen to Garshooft Garshooft
northeast and by north about thirteen leagues, but between them both there
lie two Havens called Coslyn and Ruwold.

The haven of Coslyn lies distant from Colberghen northeast four leagues. And
from Coslyn Coslyn.
to Ruwold the course is northnortheast five leagues. In Ruwold Ruwold.
Haven, or in the River called Wipper a good ship may well go in, for there
come many Craers out. From Ruwold to Garshooft it is northnortheast four
leagues.

The land from Garshooft to Righshooft reaches eastnortheast nineteen or
twenty leagues: between them there lie the Havens of Stolp, Lyba and
Sernevises.

Right east from Garshooft lies Stolp Stolp.
haven, which is a River called by the name of the town, which runs unto
the said town, it is a River for small ships, although some reasonable great
ships lade there.

From Garshooft to Reefcole it is all white strand, lying distant east four
leagues. Reefcol is a high round Hill, whereby you know the land when you go
from Borneholme. From Reefcol to Lyba it is seven leagues.

Lyba lies upon a great River called the Osse. From Lyba Lyba.
to Sernevisse or Sernesse it is five leagues. Between them both there lie the
three Wolsackes, Wolsackes
which are three black stumpes of trees, by the which this Land is well known,
and right east from those three hillockes there lies a long Hill, which when
you come out of the west, and are at the west end of it shows as if it were
divided into three or four hillocks. After that follows the high land of
Righshooft, which is very shoring on the water side. Between Righshooft and
Reefcol it is a white strand, and for the most part full of trees.

Sernesse or Sernevisse Sernevisse.
is a town lying upon an out-water, which with a River runs into the Sea,
but within it divides it self into a great water. From Sernevesse to
Righshooft it is four leagues.

You may sound about Righshooft Righshooft.
sufficiently at fiveteene or twenty fathom: You may also anckor under
Righshooft, for there it is better ground then under Heel. All Pomerland along
by the Seacoast shows black with trees that stand upon it.

Thus the land of Pomerland shows between Colsberghen and the Stolp, when
you sail along by it two leagues from the land.

II. To sail from Righshooft to Dansick.
FRom Righshooft to Heel the course is southeast eight or nine leagues: when
you come near Heel, Heel.
then you are presently deep thirty fathom, and the Coast of Heel close by
the land is 24 and 30 fathom.

You may anckor under Heel at sixteen and twenty fathom close by the land,
there it is a very sloping ground, when you are a little from the land, then
you find no ground, for without the land you have no ground at forty fathom.
Rode under Heel.
A league north from Heel there runs a flat off from the land, whereof you
must take heed. When you will anckor before Heel, you may anckor on both sides
of Heel, but on the inner side it is soft ground.

From Heel to Dansick before the Wissel the course is south and by west five
leagues. If you will anckor before Wysel To anckor before Wisel.
then anckor west from the Kisten or the West head at te^ne or twelve fathom.

But to sail into the Wesel To sail into the Wesel.
or the Haven of Danske, then take heed to the two mastes, whereon there stand
two barrels, which stand upon the Kisten or the West head, place them one
against the other, and sail up upon them, and go in between the two Heads,
but when you are within Termunde, then choose the east side, for the west side
is flat, and when you come before Botesmans flat, then go on Groenswoort
side, and there make your ship fast with four cables or ropes. Wesel chanel
was wont to run in by the east side, but that is wholly stopped and spoiled.

Thus the land shows between Righshooft and Heel.

Heel. Vernoorde. Acxternes. Righshooft.

III. To sail to Conincxberghen and Memle.
FRom Wesel to Conincxberghen Haven the course is eastnortheast, and northeast
and by east thirteen leagues: but from Righshooft to Conincxberghen haven it
is east and by south seventeene or eighteen leagues: and from Heel it is
distant thirteen leagues east and west. It is altogether fair white strand,
To sail into Conincxberghen haven.
and on both sides of the Haven there stand dry trees as if they were burnt,
and on the west side there stand two beacons, which you must place one against
the other, and sailing up upon them then you find the tonnes: the tonnes lie
on both sides of the chanel, and you must sail in between the tonnes, until
you come within the Ketle, there you may lie in the wind at three and four
fathom, then you come into a great Haf or Haven, which goes up eastward to
Conincxberghen, and southeast to Melvin Melvin.
and Brunsberghen. Brunsberghen.


The two Havens aforesaid of Danske and Conincksberghen commonly alter every
year, by means of the streams of the out-waters, and the great force of the
flackes of ice, so that I can not well write of the stretching of them of any
certainty, but the Governors of the land have great care thereof, so that
they cause them to be continually well marked and beaconed.

Four leagues north and north and by west from Coninksberghen lies the point
of Loocsteede, Lockstede
or Brusteroort.

There stands a castle with a church by it, not far from each other, and
there also there are two high hillocks, and there it is all full of trees.

If you will anckor before Conincxberghen chanel or haven, you must place the
point of Lockstede north and by east from you, and there it will be eight or
nine fathom deep.

From the point of Lookstede to the haven of Memle The Memle.
n. n. e. 16 or 17 leagues: there between them both it is altogether a fair
strand, and there the land lies in a great bought or creek. The haven of
Memle reaches in n. e. and n. e. and by e. and it is two fathom deep, being
within it you go into a great haven or water, and westward up about the point
you may anckor where you will.

Thus the land shows between Conincxberghen deep and Lock stead.

Lockestede. Hankeheer.

IIII. Of the Depths and shallowes lying in these Channels.
SWin lies about south from Borneholme, and in the chanel between them both,
when you may see Borneholme it is 26 fathom deep, and when you may plainly
see the Swyn, there it is 7 and 8 fathom deep, but when you cannot discern
the land it is 12 or 13 fathom deep, for there along by the Pomersche coast
it is al flat, and that most between New deep and Garshooft, but toward
Reefcol, Ryshooft, and Heel it is 20, and 22, and 25 fathom deep by the Coast.

About 7 or 8 leagues southwest and by south from Borneholme there lies a
banck, which is no deeper then five fathom.

This banck reaches northwest and southeast, and in this haven there lie more
bancks, some of 6, 7, 8, 9, and also 10, 11, 12 and 13 fathom.

From Colsberghen to Garshooft it is altogether an even and flat strand
without banks.

In the chanel between Borneholme and Reefcol, it is 27 and 28 fathom deep.

About four leagues from the land, northwest from Reefcol there lies a banck
of nine fathom, and if you use your lead til you come to Righshooft, you shall
then find more banks then are spoken of here.

When Righshooft is s. s. w. from you about a league there it is 30 fathom
deep, and there it is altogether uneven and bankie, and the ground is white
great sand.

When Righshooft is west from you, there it is 16 fathom deep, and the ground
is white sand.

When Righshooft lies southeast from you, then you have 28 fathom deep, with
read stony ground, as if it were bankie sand.

Between Heel and Righshooft, but nearest to Heel, there it is 33 fathom
deep, and there the ground is white sand.

At Heel in the Rode it is 25 fathom deep: the ground is very sloping to 30
and 40 fathom, it is black sand.

Between Heel and Conincxberghen it is very deep, coming against Heel it is
shoring, but to Conincxberghen and the Nerungh it goes naturally and flat up.

Between Lockestede and Sevenberghen in Coerland it is all flat rising ground,
and there you may see the land at 30 and 32 fathom.

V. How these Lands and Places in their reaches and distances are situate from
each other.
FRom Camin to Colsberghen the course is northeast and by east 4 legues. From
Colsberghen to Castlyn northeast 4 leagues. From Caslyn to Ruwold n. n. e. 5

Here follows the Card N 26.
CHAPTER VII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts and Islands of Lyfland, which lie
between Memle and Revle.
I. The situation of Memle to Domesnes.
FRom Memle to Sevenberghen the land reaches northnorthwest 11 leagues: but
three leagues south from Sevenberghen lies Helighawe or Heligher Rou, Heligher
Rou.
which is a place where you lade all kind of wares.

Four leagues north from Sevenberghen lies the River of Ter Liba: This River
is six foot deep, and goes far up into the land: but within you come to a
great water. Terliba Terliba.
is also a lading place, where you lade all kind of Coerland Ware.

From Olma or Terliba to Backovens Bacovens.
the course is north and by east seven or eight leagues, next to Domesnes it is
the best land to be known in all Coerland: it is certain hillocks or downs
with trees, which show out above the rest of the land. About three leagues
south from Backovens there lies an outpoint called Steensoort, Steensort.
which is flat like Luseroort, but it is stony ground. And this Steens-oort
lies about four or five leagues south from Derwinda. Derwinda
The coast of Coerland from Sevenberghen to Derwinda reaches north and by east
fifteen or sixteen leagues. At Derwinda there stands a castle with two or
three steeples, whereby it is well known.

About seven leagues west and by north from Derwinda lies a banck, upon which
there is no more water then five fathom, it is about half a league broad, and
grows deeper on both sides easily, but how far it stretches northward or
southward is unknown to me.

From Derwinda to Luseroort Luseroort
it is northeast and by north four leagues. Luseroort is an outpoint, but when
you are against it then the land seems all to have one reach, but when you
are a league or two on the east side thereof, then you see it to be an
outpoint. Against Luseroort it is all flat water three leagues into the Sea.

The land of Luseroort to Domesnes reaches northeast and by east, and somewhat
easterlyer about twelve leagues.

From the south end of Oesel, called Swalueroort Swalueroort.
there shoots off a Sand south and by west at least two leagues into the Sea,
between Domesnes and Luseroort, but nearest to Luseroort, and shoots to the
flat of Luseroort, it is a bad Sand, very hard and broad, at some places it
is dry, Oesle sand
and four fathom deep, and in some places shallower, as you are distant from
the point of Oesel, for at some places about Oesel it is dry, and again at
some places two, two and an half, and three fathom deep. To conclude it is
hard and very uneven, and a man must there be very careful of it. West from
that Sand there lie also many Dwale-grounds, which reach north about the coast
of Oesel, which in some places are no deeper then two three, four and five
fathom.

If you will go to Ryge, and coming out of the Sea fall upon Derwinda, you
must not leave the coast of Coerland, To avoid Oesle sand
but you must run about the flat of Luseroort at five fathom, or somewhat
less, that you may not sail without the Sand of Oesel. The chanel between
the flat of Luseroort and the Sand of Oesel is not above eight or nine
fathom deep, but commonly you have seven fathom, then you go just about
this flat. The ground here against Luseroort in some places is very uneven,
sometimes six, sometimes eight and nine fathom: at one cast of the lead you
shall have two or three fathom less or more then at another time, and that
not very far from the land, but you need not fear it, for (as I said
before) you may go nere the land at four or five fathom without fear.

The land of Domesnes Domesnes
is a land very well to be known: between Derwinda and Domesnes it is all
double blewe land, and that on the east end of Domesnes is shoring, and goes
sloping down to Luseroort: also by Domesnes it is high land, and goes

map of the coast of Liefland also steeping down to Luseroort, so that two
high blewe lands go sloping down one to the other, the easterlyest high land
is Domesnes, and the westerlyest is Derwinda, and the low land between them
both is Luseroort, but the point of Domesnes is low down land, and lies from
the south point of Oesel about eastsoutheast three leagues, and the chanel
between both is sixteen and eighteen fathom deep, but the common depth of
this chanel when you come from Luseroort is 14, 15, and 16 fathom.

Thus the Coast of Coerland shows it self about Sevenberghen when you sail
along by it, being a league from it.

II. To sail from Domesnes to Ryghe and Parmout.
FRom the point of Domesnes there shoots off a Sand eastnortheast, and
northeast and by east a league into the Sea. Sand of Domesnes


From Domesnes to Rye the coast reaches first from Domdanghen southeast four
leagues: From thence to Voorwalen also southeast five leagues, and all
southeast to Tucken. From Tucken it reaches first east, then eastnortheast,
and northeast to the down, or the River of Rye. From Vorewalen to Dunemond it
is east and by south twelve leagues, and there the land between both falls
into a great Creek.

From Domesnes to Dunemond, or the haven of Ryghe the course is southeast and
by east one-and-twentie leagues. And from Domesnes to the Island Ruynen The
Island Ruynen.
the course is east and by north eight leagues. You may sound the Island of
Ruynen round about at seven and six fathom, yet on the eastsoutheast side it
runs flat a good way off: along the whole west side, or southwest side it
is all foul, sharp stony ground, come no nearer the shore there then six
fathom, for at such depth you shall sometime sound five, six and seven
fathom: Neither is there any good lying there, but on the east side as you
come about the southeast corner, there is a little Baye or Creek, near whereto
stand certain small howses, which may be seen as you come near the shore,
there about is it good lying against west winds at five or six fathom, fair
sand ground: but when the wind blows hard it will ravle there, otherwise round
about it is sharp ground: but some say that on the south side it is fair
ground.

From Ruynen to Dunemond the course is southeast sixteen leagues. If you will
anckor before the haven of Duyn, To anckor before the Haven of Ry.
then anckor at thirteen fathom, south or north from the Haven where you
will. Between Ruynen and Dunemond in the chanel it is 23 and 24 fathom deep.

To sail into the haven of Ryge, then set the town of Ryge south and by east,
To sail into the River of Righe.
or southsoutheast from you, and sail up upon it, so long until that the
Poolsche castle stands eastsoutheast from you, then the houses of Dunemond
will be southeast from you, then you shall see a great tree, set that right
north from the said houses, that is where the castle of Dunemond stood, for the
castle of Dunemond is broken down by them of Ryghe, while Duke Charles of
Sweathland lay there abouts with his ships: but to know this tree, you shall
understand that there right north there stands a dry tree, whereby you may
easily know it: now when you have the marks aforesaid of the great tree and
the houses, one against the other (as I said before) then you are right before
the haven of the Duyn, keep them standing so, and sail right up upon them,
and you shall find the right chanel, it is about three fathom and an half
deep at the entry: you must also coming north or south sound the land, and
run along by it at three or four fathom, till the said marks of the houses
and the tree are against each other, and so run in upon them, as I said
before. The land on both sides within the haven is flat, but when you are over
the entry then it is deeper, and the west side shoring or steep, but the east
side is flat, and so runs far out, then go boldly close by the west
side, till you be before Boldra, but coming against it you must put somewhat
off from the land, for south from Boldra there comes a Sand shooting off,
which in sailing up you may sail under: this is Pilots water as well in going
up as in coming down, for in such rivers as have great streams, the
shallowes alter and change many times, not only by reason of the daily
streams, but also of the running of great waters, so that it is not certain
to trust to such description as men may make thereof, which every man must
think on.

Thus Ruynen shows when you sail by it.
view of 'Ruynen' (Estonia) Thus the land shows east from the haven of Ryghe.
view of Riga

From the Haven of Ry to Parnout Parnout.
the course is north and by east twenty leagues.

About half way between them both, eleven leagues from Righe, and nine
leagues from Parnout, there lies a town called Lemsale, or Sales, Lemsale or
Sales.
there lies a bank before the haven, you may go behind it, (behind it it
is three fathom deep) you may go about it on both sides, there goes a
chanel into Sales of eight foot deep.

From Ruynen to the Island Kyn the course is eastnortheast eleven leagues. Kyn
and Sales lie distant northwest and southeast, it is a low Island, about three
leagues long, and has most part all foul ground. From Kyn to Manno and
Sorcholme, Manno. Sorcholme
all to Parnout, the course is northeast and by north eight leagues. Between
Kyn and the coast of Lyfland it is wide four leagues* and the right deep there
between them both is eight or nine fathom. Against Manno and Sorcholme it is
five and six fathom deep, and the coast of Coerland is there altogether a
fair strand. Parnout lies there in a great Creek, and before Parnout it is
three and four fathom deep: Rode before Parnout.
If you will anckor before Parnout, place the steeple of Parnout northnortheast
from you, there is the best Rode.

The Island Kyn and the haven of Righelye distant south and north thirteen or
fourteen leagues.

III. The situation of the East-coast of Oesle.
ABout two leagues and an half northwest from Domesnes is the Rode of Oesle,
Rode of Oesle.
when the church of Oesel is west and by north half a league from you, and the
point of Oesle whereon the houses stand west, there is the best Rode at seven
fathom soft ground, there you lie safe against a westsouthwest wind, all
along by Oesle it is flat ground, of three four and five fathom.

Five leagues northward from Domesnes lies the Island Abrick, Abrick.
which lies distant from Ruynen northwest and by west, and southeast and by
east seven or eight leagues, and there between them both it is almost full of
Dwalegrounds, of three four, five and six fathom, but they lie nearest to
Abrick. Abrick is a foul Island, with stony ground, and many Dwalegrounds; it
lies within a league and an half of Oesle. From Abrick to Arensbergh,
Arensbergh.
in Oesle, the course is north and by west four or five leagues, it is a lading
place for barley and fat wares. From the south end of Oesle to Arensbergh
through within Abrick it is northnortheast eleven leagues.

From Abrick to the north end, or northeast end of Oesle the course is
northeast and somewhat norrtherlyer ten or eleven leagues: but from Ruynen to
the aforesaid point of Oesle it is north 13 leagues. If you will sail from
Abrick or from Ruynen, about the northeast point of Oesle you must take good
heed of the Paternosters, Paternosters.
which is a Sand a league from the said point reaching into the Sea. From the
northeast point of Oesle to Parnout the coast of Lyfland reaches eastsoutheast
and westnorthwest.

The Island Abrick lying a league from Oesle.
view of Abruka

IIII. The situation of the West-coast of Oesle and of Dageroort.
FRom the south end of Oesle (as I said before) there shoots off a great
Sand south and by west into the Sea, almost three leagues. From Swalueroort or
the south end of Oesle to Hondsoort Hondsoort.
the course is northnorthwest, and north and by west sixteen leagues. Between
them both lie two lading places, called Wycke and Reecke: Wyke and Reeke.
this coast of Oesle is very uneuen and foul ground, and about the south end
there lie many Dwalegrounds, of three or four fathom, which are very hard.

From Hondsoort to the point of Dageroort the course is northnorthwest eight
leagues. Upon Dageroort Dageroort
there stands a high steeple or tower, which they of Revle built there, to
know the land by it: and between Hondsoort and Dageroort there is a great
Creek, for there goes also a water between Dageroort and Oesle, but is very
flat and dry, so that no ships can go through it. Such ships as mistake
Swalueroort or Oesle, many times are at their wits ends in this Creek, for
there is no manner of thing to know the land by, and there it is all sharp
ground, but when you come against the land of Dageroort, when you are in this
creek, then you see the said tower of Dageroort over the land, whereby men
then know it. Under the point of Dageroort there is fair Sandground, and
very good anckoring against the north and northeast winds. You may run
about the point of Dageroort at seven or eight fathom, and north from the
point it is also good lying.

From Dageroort to Sibrichsnes Sybrighsnes.
the land reaches northeast about seven leagues. Between them both, that is
three leagues from Dageroort and four leagues from Sibrichsnes, there reaches
a Sand cross from the land northwest into the Sea six or seven leagues, and
it is a flat sloping land, going to the Scharen: first it is of three, four,
five, six and seven fathom, and then it is sometimes deeper, to the Finsche
Scharen.

Sybrichsnes is an out-point that has two points, from either of which
shoots off a Riffe or Sand: but between the two Sands there is good Rode,
fair flat ground, and good sand-ground, there you may anckor as near the
shore as you will at six, five or four fathom: but a little west from the
westerlyest point of Sybrichsnes, not far from the land, there lies a
shallowe about as great as a ship, where it is no deeper then twelve foot
water.

From Sibrighsnes to Oetgensholme the course is eastnortheast seven leagues.
Between them both the Meunsond goes in.

South from Oetgensholme there goes a great Creek into the land, whereon
there lies an Island, and above the Island there lies a town called Hapsale,
Hapsale.
you may anckor there where you will. On the south side of this Creek there
runs a great Sand or Stone-shelfe somewhat more then a league into the Sea,
which is very broad, Sand of Hapsale.
there you may go in by it to Meunsond.

Thus the land of Dageroort shows to Sybrichsnes.

V. To sail into the Meunsond behind or north about from Oesle, to the Creek
of Ryghe.
FRom Sibrighsnes to Osseholme and Grasholmes Grasholm.
the course is s. e. four or five leagues. The Grasholms are two green Islands,
and Osseholme Osseholm.
lies about a league west from Grasholmes, where you may sail round about,
and also ankor: but about a league north, and north and by east from Osseholme,
there lies a Landlose-ground which you must shun, which is called the West
Grasseground, for there are two shallowes which are called the Grasgrounds:
Grasgrounds.
the other Grasground which is called the Easterly, lies over against
Grasholme to the Sand of Hapsale, having no more then four or five foot water,
if you will sail into Meunsond, you must be very careful to shun it.

If you will sail through Meunsond To sail into Meunsond.
from Oetgens you must go southsouthwest to Grasholme, and there sail in
close by it, to shun the Grasground which there lies eastward over against
it. From Grasholme to the point of Oesle, whereon the great tree stands, the
course is southsoutheast seven leagues. From Grasholme to Oesle there lie four
Islands, each about a league from the other. When you sail from Grasholme to
Oesle, then you sail along by these Islands, leaving them about two or three
cables length on starborde, till you come to the land of Oesle, right over
against the great tree, in that chanel it is five fathom deep.

When you sail in this manner and come before the Grasground, then on
baghborde you find an Island, and against it, the haven or chanel goes in to
the castle of Meunsond, Meunsond castle.
at three fathom, and then it is somewhat flatter, for there it is full of
Sands. South or west from the said Island there goes in a chanel, which you may
sail through to Oesle, and then you leave the two Islands on the south end of
Oesle on starborde.

But the right and best chanel goes from the aforesaid great tree along by the
land of Oesle, which is three or four fathom deep, and at last it is six
fathom, seven and eight fathom deep again, and sailing along by it, then
you leave the two aforesaid Islands by the end of Oesle on baghborde. From the
great Tree to the first Island the course is eastsoutheast five leagues, then
from the first Island to the second southeast, and then forth to the end of
Oesle east and by south, and coming about there, you may sail into the
Righsche Sea, or the creek eastsoutheast to Kyn, south to Ruynen, and
southwest or somewhat southerlyer to Abrick, or whither you will: but you must
take good heed of the Paternoster, which shoots off from the point of Oesle,
almost a league into the Sea.

VI. The situation of Oetgensholme to Revle.
THe Island of Oetgensholme Oetgensholme.
may be sailed round about, and you may also anckor behind it at six or seven
fathom.

From Oetgensholme to great Roghe Great Roghe.
the course is east and by north, or a little easterlyer four leagues: between
them both a little beside the right chanel lies a shallowe which you may sail
round about: this Shallowe lies with a Rigge of Sand even and alike with the
water, and round about is rockie and stony. Great Roghe is a white out-point,
wherein there are two or three chalk hills. Behind Oetgensholme, south from
Great Roghe, there lies another point, called Little Roghe, Little Roghe.
between Great and Little Roghe there goes in a wide River or Haven of six
and seven fathom, but in the end it is dry. It is there all fair ground,
and good to anckor in.

From Great Roghe to the Island Nargen, Nargen.
the course is east and west five leagues. When you sail from Great Roghe to
Narghen, three or four leagues east from great Roghe you find a point called
Surp, Surp.
wherein also there lie two white spots or patches, and then you see the
Island of Nargen lying out before you, if then you will sail to Revle, then
leave the Island Nargen on baghborde, and run in by the point of Surp, about
east, to the end of the Island, and when you are at the end of the Island, the^
go on eastsoutheast more then a league, so shall you come by the end of the
Sand that shoots off from Bare Carels, come no nearer unto it then at six
fathom: Now when the castle of Revle comes without the Carels, The situation
of the Rode before Revle.
then sail straight to the east side of the Head at Revle, and there let your
anckor fall, and turn with your beak head or your stearne to the Head, and
make it fast there with four ropes, for-that the north and northnorthwest
winds blow there open into the Haven, so that there it heaveth and sets
very much.

From the southende of Nargen to the Island Wolf Wolf.
the course is east, and east and by north four leagues, and that Island is a
league long. Northnorthwest and northwest and by north two leagues from the
west end of this Island, and northeast and northeast and by east from the north
end of Nargen lies a rock or stone called the Revle stone, when the steeple
of Revle comes against the west end of the Island, then you are past or east
of this rock. The right marks of the Revle stone are these: when the northeast
end of Nargen is southwest and southwest and by west from you, and the steeple
of Revle is a windbeames length west of the Island Wolf, then are you just about
it, there is but three foot water. In Somer when it is fair wether, sometimes
the water is so smooth, that the waves beat not upon the rock: but if it be
rough wether you may easily perceive it by the breaking of the waves. The Revle
stone is very steep, you must not come nearer unto it then twelve fathom.

From the west end of the Island Wolf shoots out a point northward into the
Sea, about a fourth part of a league toward the Revle stone, upon the end of
the point lie five or six stones something above the water, so that they may
well be perceived. If you come sailing from Revle north and by west beside the
Wolf so long till the point of Surp come even against the Island of Nargen,
then you have just the length of that point, then look out of the ship on
starborde, and you shall see the foresaid stones upon the end of the point,
you may run about by them at five fathom without danger.

CHAPTER VIII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Lyfland, Russia, and Finland,
from Revle to the Narve, and Wyborgh, and from thence to Alants Haf.
I. The situation between Revle and the Narve.
IN the former Chapter it is showed how you shall sail from Nargen to Revle,
before the town, and also to the Island of Wolf.

From the Wolf to the Island of Wranger I Will of Wranger,
the course is east and by south, but going outward about, it is east and by
north seven or eight leagues. Under Wranger there is good Rode, and good
anckoring on both sides, and all over good anckor ground. But on the southside
from Wranger lies a long small Island, which is rockie and foul. Northwest and
northwest and by north about a league from Wranger lies a rock, and about two
leagues from Wranger lies also another little Island.

From Wranger to the Eecholmes Eckholme
it is east, and east and by north thirteen leagues. Between them both lies
a foul point upon the Coast of Lyfland, which you must shun, for there lie
many Rocks off from it, otherwise all the Coast of Lyfland is very fair,
all along to the River of Narve. Between this foul point aforesaid, and the
Island of Eeckholme there is a fair Creek upon the Coast of Lyfland, Rode
unner Lyfland.
where you may anckor safely against a southeast wind. The Eckholmes also are
fair round about, and under them it is good rode.

From the Eckholmes to Telsborgh, it is east and west six or seven leagues.
Northward from Telsborch Telsborch
in this chanel there lie very bad grounds and rocks, Hooften or Huften.
called the Hoften, which round about them have very foul and bad shallowes,
which you must shun: but the Eckholmes as also the coast of Lyfland are
fair, you may sail within half a league along by the coast of Lyfland, and
leave these shallowes and shelfes on the left hand.

From Telsborch to the Narve in the Rode it is east and by south sixteen
leagues. To sail to the Narve north from the Huf^^,
To sail from Wranger north from the Hoften to the Narve, the course from
Wranger to Highland is eastnortheast, and east and by north three-and-twentie
leagues. From the Great Hooften there comes a shallowe shooting off
westnorthwest into the Sea, which is at least two leagues long, which is called
the Chalcke grounds, Chalk grounds
you must take heed of it. The Small Hooften Small Hoften.
also are full of Sands and Rocks, so that you can hardly sail through them,
for those foul Sands and Shallowes run all from the Tutters Tutters
along Lyfland, nere the east end of Eckholme. Tutters lie from High land
southsoutheast two leagues distant, and northwest and by west from Highland
about four leagues from the land, there lies a Rock under the water, which is
no deeper then two fathom.

From Highland to the Rode of the Narve, The Rode of the Narve.
the course is southeast thirteen leagues, and then you must go through
between Highland and Tutters: and likewise when you sail from the Rode of the
Narve northwestward, then you go through between Tutters and Highland. To
sail into the Narve.
If you will go into the Narve, you must place the woode^ tower with the mast,
right upon Narve castle, and so go into the haven. The land of the Narve is
known by the round hills which lie on the south side of the Rode.

Thus Eckholme shows when you sail along by it.

II. To sail from Wranger, and also from the Narve to Wybergh.
ABout two leagues north from Wranger lies a little Island full north: from that
Island toward Highland is the course somewhat more easterly then eastnortheast
three-and-twentie leagues, then you run full north. Highland Highland.
is about three leagues long, and hardly a league broad: it lies in length
southsoutheast and northnorthwest: to them that come out of the west it shows
with three hillocks: on the north and east side it is full of trees. On the
east side a little about the north point is there a little Creek by a boores or
husbandmans house, there is fair ground, and good lying against west winds. A
certain space southward from thence, not far from the shore lies a great
stone above the water: On the north end, also on the west side to the
southwest point it is wholly fair ground and good lying.

From Highland to the Summers (that is a little Island) the course is east and by
north seven leagues. A little east from the Island Summers So^mers.
there lie certain rocks above the water, but you may safely sail through
betwixt the rocks and the Island. From Summers to the Goeschare, or (which is
all one thing) the great Fisher, Goeschare or the great Fisher.
is the course full northeast distant seven leagues. The great Fisher is a low
Island, consisting of seven rocks joined together, therefore it is also called
the Seven-rockes, and when you first descrie it, it appears with four
hillocks, as if it were four low Islands. From the great Fisher to the little
Fisher The little Fisher.
is the course northeast and by east distant four small leagues. Round about
both the Fishers you may seek and find Rode, for both of them are very
fair, but that on the south side of the great Fisher there lies a blind
rock about a pieces shot from the shore, when the water is not wholly calm,
but that the weather is something rough, you may easily see the waves break
thereon. About a pieces shot southeast, or southeast and by east from the
little Fisher there lies a Rock even above the water, as if it were a Seals
head, the common chanel is there between both. From the little Fisher to
Corssenes is the course eastnortheast, and somewhat more easterly a league,
upon the point of Corsnes Corsnes.
lies a stone as if it were a Iol, you must sail about it at four fathom and
an half. West from Corsnes lie two Islands close by the land, but eastward from
the point you may anckor against westerly winds at five or six fathom. About
two leagues cross from Corsnes there are many rockss that lie under the
water, some at a fathom, some at half a fathom, some more some less, you
cannot venture out of the chanel but with very great danger. It is not
possible to describe the right situation of all, the grounds are there so
uneven and craggie: so full of rocks, and craggie shallowes, that it is to be
wondered at. From Corsnes to the Roohel Rohel.
the course is northeast and by north about three leagues. You must leave the
Island of Rohel on starborde and sail close by it, or in the middle of the
water: but not close by the north point, which our sailors call John
Lambertsons point, for there shoots off a stony point, which is shoring:
notwithstanding you may sail about there safely by the plummet at seven or
eight fathom, but come no nearer. In the right chanel betwixt both it is 14
and 15 fathom deep. When you come within the Roodehel you may anckor where
you please, and fetch a Pilot from the land, which may bring you to Wyborgh.

From Narve Rode to the Russia Hacken Russia Hacken.
the course is north and south five leagues distant. This point is called
Castram, Castram.
and there lies a town called so.

From the Point or the Russia Hacken to the Rode Hell the course is northeast
and by north, and southwest and by south about 26 leagues. Between them both
on the Russia coast there is no Seafaring, although some Rivers go into the
land. There the land lies in a great creek, and reaches from the Russia
Hacken to the River Nioa or Oreschack The River of Nioa or Oreschack
eastnortheast 13 or 14 leagues. This River of Nioa devideth Russia from
Finland through the Ladingh, which is a great lake or water within the land.
The strong castle of Noetenburgh lies there also upon a River, which reaches
out of the Lyflands or East Sea into the aforesaid Lake: From thence the land
reaches northnortheast and north and by east thirteen or fourteen leagues,
to the Roodehel.

III. The situation from Wyborgh to Elsen-vos.
FRom the Rodehel to Porrescharen the course is southwest and by west about
five leagues. And from Porrescharen Porrescharre.
to the Fisher the course is southwest three leagues, which is a great out
Scharre, which lies alone: but eastward from the Fisher Fisher.
there lie some out-scharres in the middle of the chanel, and lie almost like
water, they lie almost right in the chanel between the Fisher and the
Roodehel. The course from the Fisher to Roodhel is northeast and by east and
southwest and by west 7 or 8 leagues.

From Goescharen to the Badscharen, or Espelscharen Esplescharen.
the course is westsouthwest, and southwest and by west 11 or 12 leagues. The
Espelscharen is a great heap of out scharres, and there right east there lies
a great rock called Quade scharre, Quade-scharre.
which you may sail round about.

From Espelscharen to Putsfagre Putsfagre.
the course is west and east seven leagues. Putsfagre is a great Rock or Island,
lying north and by west from Hogheland, distant seven leagues: from thence you
may go where you will between the Swethen Scharres: if you will go within
the Scharres, at Putsfagre you must take in a Pilot, who will bring you through
the rocks where you will, you run in in all places, and within the Rocks or
Scharres it is for the most part good anckor ground. About a league right south
from Putsfagre there lies a blind rock which you must shun. From Putsfagre
to Peltingscharen Peltingscharres.
it is 5 leagues: West from these out-rockes there lies a haven called
Peltingsond, Peltingsond.
which runs in northeast, there within there are a great number of Rocks
and Scharres, where you lie safe from all winds, and you may, being in, sail
through the rocks, so you have a good Pilot, whither you will.

From Peltingsond to the haven of Elsenvos, The haven of Elsenvos.
the course is west, and west and by south 12 leagues. On the west side of the
haven there lies a high round rock, whereon there stands a warder or mast,
which is called Cubben: on the other side of the haven, over against Cubben,
Cubben.
there lies a long rock or Island called Santam, Santam.
between these two rocks the haven of Elsenvos goes in, and reaches in most
part northeast, and northeast and by north, through between the rocks.

A certain space east from the foresaid long rock called Santam, there is
another round rock called Mely: Mely.
these three rocks are marks of this haven.

To sail into the haven of Elsenvos, To sail into the chanel of Elsenvos.
first it reaches in northeast, till you are within the rocks, then it
reaches northnortheast, till you come to the river of Elsenvos, there you may
anckor between the rocks, for there it is good anckor ground. There runs
also a chanel through within the rocks, and comes in again by Putsfagre into
the Sea, but runs very crookedly about, and it is Pilots water.

IIII. The situation of Elsenvos to the Alandsche Haf.
FRom Elsenvos to the out-rocks of Luys Out rocks of Luys.
the course is west and by south twelve leagues: And from the out-rockes three
or four leagues more to the haven of Luys. The haven of Luys The haven of Luys.
goes in west from the rough Island, and there goes a chanel up through the
rocks to Abo east, and east and by north thirteen leagues long, and it
runs into the Sea again by Corpo. A little way upward in this chanel, you
go by a rock, which lies under the water, which is of Loadestone, Lodestone
there the compasses always run about, and can not stand still, till you are
a league from it. When you are without the rocks of Luys, then you may see the
land of Revle, there right over on the other side.

From the out-rocks of Luys to the haven of Wtoy it is west and east about 21
leagues. Between Utoy and the haven of Luys, there are no havens for ships
to go in, although that there between them both it is all broken land and
rocks.

Utoye Vtoy.
is a great Island, whereon there stands a mast with a barrel, there westward
the chanel of Aboo goes up: first it reaches in north, and north and by east
about three or four leagues, and then you come against an Island, along by that
great Island, The chanel of Abbo.
and then it reaches forward northeast to the haven of Aboo, and Aboo lies at
the end of that foresaid great Island.

From Utoy to the uttermost Island of the Alandsche Haf, it is west and east
nine leagues: there lie three Islands, called Ercke, Ercke.
Castleholme, Castleholme.
and Corpo: Corpo.
Ercke is the outermost from the Alandsche Haf, and from thence Corpesond goes
in, and goes along northeast by Corpe. Corpe lies within the other Island, and
from Corpe you may strike over to the haven of Abbo, which comes running from
Utoy. You may also sail up this haven about behind Lipland, Corpsond.
and come so out into the Northbodem.

Between Uxe or Bostle, and the Islands of Aland the Alandsche Haf goes in,
which is called the North-bodem, which goes up so far into Finland, that a
ship with a good fair wind can hardly sail to the end thereof in five
days. Upon the uttermost of these Northbodems there lies a town called
Toren, there Sweathland and Fynland part asunder.

CHAPTER IX. THE DESCRIPTION OF the situation of the Seacoasts and Havens of
Sweathland, which lie between Stocholme and Valsterboen: as also of Gotland,
Oeland, and other Islands more there abouts.
I. How you shall sail into the Haven of Stockholme.
THe Sweathland Out-scharres and Rocks lying before the haven of Stockholme
lie distant from the Islands of Aland southwest, and southwest and by south
two-and-thirtie or three-and-thirtie leagues: as in the Chapter before is
declared.

The haven of Stockholme goes in south, by a point called Landsoort, Landsoort
a little north from thence there lies a rock above the water, called the
Heyr-hamer, Heyrhamer.
it is a foul rock, and to seaward from this rock there lies another great
rock, called Wigh-steene, it lies distant from the point of Landsoort
northeast three leagues, Wighstone
and upon it there is a clift, you must go in close by it, and leave it on
baghborde, you may also go in westward about, between this rock and the
Heyr-hamer, for it is very fair round about it, then you come by a rock
called Middlestone Middlestone.
which also is cloven, and shows like a saddle of a horse, you must leave
that on starborde. Between Wighstone and Middlestone the haven of Stocholme
reaches in about northnortheast: if you will sail into the haven of Stocholme
you must be wary and take heed of a row of rocks, which lie under the water,
southeast and by east from Wighstone, where you must go close in, cross
before the chanel, they are called Crawasen, Crawasen.
and there north lies Gomberstone Gomberstone.
southsoutheast from the Middlestone. East from the haven of Stockholme there
lies another great rock, which is called Schareopen, Scharope^.
when you are past Middlestone and are between both the lands, then you find
a rock called Rookoe. From Middlestone to Rookoe Rookoe.
the course is northeast and by north a league, and there you may run about
on both sides if you will. Rookoe lies within the haven of Stockholme, and the
point thereof reaches into the Daler Daler.
northeast and by north.

Without the Daler Elsnap Elsnap.
lies, and within the Daler Hartsticke Hartstick.
goes in, but is sonke with ships, so that no good ships can go through:
the Hartstick reaches first northwest to the bocht, and then to Conincxhaven
west and west and by north.

From the Daler to Deerhaven, Dierhave^.
the haven of Stockholme reaches northeast and by north, and northeast: from
Duerhaven to Steendoren Steendoren.
it reaches southwest, and southwest and by west, from thence to the old
church yard The Old church yard.
westnorthwest, from the old church yard to Waxholme Waxholm.
west and westsouthwest, there you may shut the haven with a boome: from
thence it is southwest and by south, and southsouthwest to Conincxhaven or S.
Blasins holme: S. Blasens holme.
from Conincxhaven or S. Blasins holme the course to the town of Stockholme is
westnorthwest, and northwest a league.

The chanel of Stockholme runs along by the Northland in again into the
Northbodem, and so into the East-sea, it reaches between Wedde and Uxe about
northeast and southwest, you must leave the firm land on baghborde, and the
great Islands on starreborde, and so run about northeast, and northeast and by
east to the North bodem.

II. The situation of the Coast of Sweathland, between the haven of Stocholme,
and the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe.
TWo leagues westsouthwest from the point of Landsoort there lies a great rock
named Hartshals, which is very well to be known, between them both the land
there reaches east and west. West from this rock there goes in another haven
or chanel, which you may run through behind Elsnap with jachts toward
Stocholme.

West from this Haven the Haven of Telghen The haven of Telgen.
goes in, which reaches in about northwest almost to the Moller, and at the
end of the chanel lies Telghen, but before it there lies a town called
Trosa. Trosa.


From the aforesaid rock called Hartshals, to the Haven of Stickborch The haven
of Stickborch.
the course is w. n. w. but from Landsoort to this haven the land reaches east
and west: it is a wide haven, and in the mouth thereof Newecoppen Newecoppen.
lies on the north side, but Sticxborch lies on the south side: Southcoppen.
then there go two havens more in, the one to South, and the other to North
Coppen. Northcoppen.


From Landsoort to the Haven of Silbuy Silbuy.
the course is s. w. and by s. 19 leagues: It reaches in n. w. and n. w. and
by n. If you will anckor under Silbuy, you must turn up eastward, and anckor
before the town in the middle of the rocks, at seven, eight and nine fathom.
You may there sail through the Sweathland Rocks to Westwick, Fluyerbuy,
Vrouwenbergh, Sticxholme, and so northward to Schelsuyer, there it is all fair
ground, and is fiveteene, eighteen and twenty fathom deep.

If you will go to Vrouwenbergh Vrouwenbergh.
or Fluerbuy, Fleurbuy.
then sail forward west, and west and by north, till you come against the
land, then you may anckor against Fleurbuy, or you may turn up northwest
between the Island of Vrouwenbergh and the firm land, and there anckor at
twelve fathom. You may also run through it into Westerwick.

Westerwick.
Westerwick lies distant from Silbuy west, and west and by north through within
the Rocks, and there it is fiveteene or sixteen fathom deep.

From Silbuy to Schelsuyr Schelsuyr.
it is norrhwest seven leagues, all through within the rocks: Schelsuyr is a
fair Haven or Creek: there lies a rock in the Haven, but you may go about
it on both sides, and anckor before the town.

East from Schelsuyr lies Hontsbaye, Hontsbay.
and then Green Island, Greene-Iland.
there also is good anckor ground, and you may run along thereby to
Sticxborgh.

The out-rockes and scharres of Silbuy, and the land of New Coppen, or of
Telghen lie distant about north and by east and south and by west fiveteene
leagues: but the Out scharres of Silbuy and the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe lie
distant south and by east, and north and by west eight leagues.

From Landsoort by the Haven of Stockholme to the Ioncvrouwe the course is
fouthsouthwest four-and-twentie leagues. But from the Haven or the Out-rocks of
Silbuy to the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe it is south and by east eight leagues.

III. The situation of Gotland with the Islands lying about it.
FRom the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe Sweathland Ioncvrowe.
to Carelsoo the course is east, and east and by north eleven or twelve leagues.

Great Carelsoo and Small Carelsoo, lie close one by the other, they are two
small high Islands, lying on the west side of Gotland: The Small Carelsoo Small
Carelsoo.
lies nearest to Gotland, and there under it is round about good Rode, at
eight, nine, and ten fathom, for round about it it is fair and clean:
Under Great Carelsoo Great Carelsoo.
also it is good Rode, on the west and east-sides, but on the north and south
sides it is foul, therefore you must go no nearer to Carelsoo by night then
eleven or twelve fathom. Between Great Carelsoo and Small Carelsoo it is
twelve, thirteen and fourteen fathom deep. Right over against Carelsoo
lies westergarde Westergarde.
upon Gotland.

From Carelsoo to Wisbuy Wisbuy.
in Gotland the course is northeast six or seven leagues. Men were wont in
old time to anckor there behind a Head or Kissed. In times past this was a
notable and famous town of Merchandise, where all trade of Merchandise was
used, but now by Gods visitation it is clean decayed and spoiled. There yet to
this day you may see many decayed houses of Marble, and other hewn stones,
whereby a man may partly see and guess her former situation and proportion. The
Hanze towns did there for a long time hold their staple and trade, the old
Water-lawes are there made, and also the old famous Cards, which in times past
were very perfect, but now altogether fpoyled.

From Carelsoo to Gotland Sand Gotland Sand.
the course is northeast, and northeast and by north one-and-twentie leagues.
Gotland Sand is an Island of a league great, you may sail round about it, and
round about it it is white strand. From the northwest point there shoots off
a Sand, there it is six, seven, and eight fathom deep, and all over good
anckor ground.

The Coperstone Coperstone.
lies distant from Gotland Sand westnorthwest and northwest and by west three
leagues.

Four or five leagues south and by west, and southsouthwest from Gotland Sand
lies Faro Sand, Faro sand.
and at the north end of Faro Sand there shoots off a badde foul shelf or
Sand northnortheast about two leagues into the Sea; which is called
Salf-onreyn. Salf-onreyn.
You may run into Farosand at two and three fathom deep, and there stands
a church with a flat steeple upon the land. From Farosand to Sliet-haven
Sliet have^.
the course is south and by west three leagues, and from thence to Ostergarde
Ostergarde.
also south and by west four leagues.

From Ostergarde there lies an Island, which you may sail round about, and
anckor where you will, at seven or eight fathom. You may sail into Ostergarde
about on both sides of the said Island: The south chanel reaches in north at
seven fathom, and the east chanel, north from the Island, reaches in southwest
and southsouthwest.

From Ostergarde to Houborch the southwest end of Gotland the course is
southwest, and southwest and by south about twelve or thirteen leagues.

Between them both there lie four Havens, called Santwick, Narwick, Boswick
and Heylicholme.

The haven of Santwick Santwick.
reaches in about northnorthwest, within it is five and six fathom deep:
there stands a chapel upon the point of the land, and there it is good
lying. This Haven and Ostergarde are distant southwest and by south, and
northeast and by north about a league and an half.

Narwick.
Narwick lies from Santwick southwest three leagues, and on the east side of
the Haven there lies a long rock, which you must go in by, and leave the
other sharp rock on baghborde, and anckor within the haven at four or five
fathom.

A league west from Narwick lies Boswick: Boswick.
there lies an Island in the middle of the haven, it is best to go in south
from it, but you may also go in north about it, and then you leave the two
rocks on starreborde: it is a fair haven, and in it is three fathom water.

A league south from it lies Heylich holme, Heylich-holme.
it is also a good haven, but it is little known.

From Heylich holme to the south end of Gotland the course is southwest five
leagues. On the south end of Gotland there stands a high steeple called
Houborch. Houborch
At Houborch also there goes in a haven, you may anckor before it at six or
seven fathom. Sand of Gotland.
From the south point of Gotland there runs a Sand a great way into the
Sea, which is very stony, but you may sound it about at seven, eight, and
nine fathom.

IIII. The situation of Oeland, Calmersond, and so to Valsterbon.
FRom the south-point of Gotland to the southpoint of Oeland the course is as
much westerly as southwest three-and-twentie or four-and-twentie leagues.: but
the north end of Oeland lies distant from the south end of Gotland
westnorthwest, or as some say west and by north ten or eleven leagues..

The Island of Oeland Oeland.
as some say is four-and-twentie leagues long, and a great league broad, when
you sail along by it you may tell eighteen steeples which are all flat.
The eastcoast reaches north and by east, and south and by west, it is a fair
coast, but about seven or eight leagues south from the north end, there
shoots off a Sand cross from the land about a league into the Sea, which you
must shun. By it also there goes in a haven, Haven in Oeland.
where indifferent ships may go in, otherwise Oeland has never a Haven. But
within Calversond there a man may anckor under Oeland, very fitly to lade, for
there it is good lying in all places.

From the north end of Oeland to the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe, Sweathla^d
Ioncvrouwe.
the course is west and by south: you may sail round about it, and anckor
where you will, there it is eighteen or nineteen fathom deep.

From the Sweathland Ioncvrouwe to the rocks of Calmer, the course is
southsouthwest eleven leagues. Calmersond Calmersond.
stretches through to Der-clipping south and by west, and north-and by east
twelve or thirteen leagues, there it is not all to broad nor deep, there
about you have three fathom and a foot deep: If you come out of the south you
may run in west also from the rocks, but there it is no more then twelve
foot deep, and that runs in northnorthwest.

About eight leagues south from Calmer, and four leagues north from the Rough
Island there lies a little town called Overschaer, there abouts shoots out a
stony Sand, about a third part of a league from the shore into the Sea, come
no nearer unto it then ten fathom.

From the south end of Oeland there shoots off a great Sand, at least a
great league into the Sea, Sand of Oeland.
and there it is seven or eight fathom deep, when the chapel upon Suyder
Norden is northwest a league from you, there it is ten or eleven fathom
deep, you may sound it about at eight or nine fathom, the south end of
Oeland is called Zuydernorden, and the Sand is called the Sand of Zuydernorden.
From thence to Derclipping Derclipping.
it is westsouthwest eight leagues

North from Derclippingh or Out-clippingh lies the Rough Island. Between that
Island and the firm land it is foul and craggie, so that you cannot sail
through there: but upon the east side of the Rough Island you may sail along at
ten or twelve fathom without hurt. On the west or northwest side of the
Rough Island there is good Rode, where is good lying, at eight or nine fathom
fair ground, against the northeast and east winds.

From Derclipping to Ahuys the course is west, and west and by south ten or
eleven leagues: between them both, that is, west and west and by north from
Derclippingh five leagues lies a great rock called Malqueren, Malqueren.
which you may anckor under. North from this rock the town called Rottenbuy
Rottenbuy.
lies in a Creek: before it, as also before Eleholme Eleholme.
you may anckor at six, seven and eight fathom, for there is good anckor
ground.

There goes up a river to Ahuys Ahuys.
of eight or ten foot deep, and before it as also before Selsborgh Selsborch.
the Rode is seven or eight fathom.

From Ahuys to Hanneu or Hanno the course is southeast five leagues. Hanno
Hanno.
is a high round Island, you may sail and anckor round about it at ten,
eleven and twelve fathom. From Hanno to the north end of Borneholme it is
south and by east and north and by west eleven or twelve leagues distant.

South from Hanno lies a town called Sant-haver, Santhaver
west or north from it lies Somer-haven Somer haven.
in a round baye, and there it is very good anckor ground.

From the north end of Borneholme to Utstede the course is northwest eight
leagues. Wtstede.
But from Utstede to Valsterbon the coast reaches about westsouthwest
thirteen or fourteen leagues.

Thus the southende of Oeland shows when it is cross from you.
view of Oland

V. Of the depths and grounds situate in these channels.
Between Gotland and the Sweathland rocks and skarres in the chanel it is 34
and 38 fathom deep, and close by Gotland it is 25 fathom deep.

Two leagues from the land west from Ostergarde it is about one-and-thirtie
fathom deep soft ground.

Between Ostergarde and Houborch you have a banck of four-and-twentie fathom,
it is great read sand, then you can not see the land out of the top of the
mast.

And eastward also you have a banck there of fourteen fathom deep, it is
graye and white sand, when you are over it, then you find no ground at forty
fathom.

When Houborch is northnortheast seven leagues from you there it is fiveteene
fathom deep, stony ground. And when you go from thence northeast three
leagues, there it is twenty fathom great stony ground.

If you will sail from Borneholme to Ostergarde, you must not spare your lead,
but still cast it out toward these banks, that you may make your account
thereafter.

Between Gotland and Oeland it is uneven to sound the depth: sometimes you
have two-and-twentie and three-and-twentie fathom, and sometimes
nine-and-twentie fathom, and all black grayish pieces of ground, sometimes
stones as great as pease, which are black and earthly colored.

When you are northwest and northwest and by north from Houborch almost three
leagues from the land, there you have great read stony Sand, with black
stones in it as big as beans.

When Zuydernorden lies west from you three leagues, there it is soft ground
seven-and-twentie and nine-and-twentie fathom deep.

And when the chapel upon Zuydernorden lies westnorthwest from you three
leagues, there it is thirty and one-and-thirtie fathom deep, it is lymie
soft ground.

When Zuydernorden lies northnorthwest, and somewhat northerlyer from you, and
you are a league from the land, there it is thirteen fathom deep.

When you are past Zuydernorden and come against Derclippingh in the chanel,
there it is nine-and-thirtie fathom deep, and there it is slickie and soft
ground.

If I should describe all the banckes which lie in the East-sea severally and
perticularly by themselves, they alone would conteyne a whole volume, for that
in many places it is very banckie and uneven, for you shall come in no place
but you shall find banckes, as between Houborch and Ostergarde, between
Zuydernorden and Gotland, and between Oeland and Borneholme, and likewise
against Reefcol and Righshooft, where you find several banckes, and of
unequal and several depths. Between Iasmont and Borneholme you find banckes
of seven, ten, fiveteene and twenty fathom, as in their places it is partly
showed: also on Righsche bodem it is full of banckes, of fiveteene, twenty,
and five-and-twentie fathom. The deepest water of the East-sea is about forty
fathom. Thus much I thought good to place here, that no man by reason of such
banckes, should err and go out of the way.

VI. How these Places lie distant from each other.
HOw the Haven of Stockholme reaches in from point to point, and all the
Islands and rocks thereabouts, it is already described at large.

CHAPTER X. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Schoonen, Zeeland, Haland, and
the Land of Northeast, from Valsterbon to Schaghen.
I. The situation between Valsterbon and the Sond.
Valsterboen sand.
THe Sand of Valsterbon reaches about southwest above a league to Seaward: If
you come out of the east, you may anckor under Valsterboen Sand at 7 or 8
fathom, so that then the steeple of Valsterbon stands west or west and by
north from you: from Valsterboen Sand along by the Bleesche side to Drelborch
it is very flat.

Rode under Steden.
You may also anckor under Steden, safe against a northerly wind, but you must
run in somewhat far between Steden and Meun into the creek, and anckor
between Meun and Steden at eight or nine fathom, so that the shoring point of
Steden may lie northnortheast from you.

Kuycke.
North from Steden you must ru^ne up westward to Kuycke, which lies in a great
creek, it is there all shallowe or flat water at five, six, or seven fathom,
and you may anckor there where you will. Close by Steden it is twelve and
thirteen fathom deep.

On the Sand of Valsterboen there lies a tonne at four fathom, and you may
sound about the Sand at five fathom without danger. When the steeple of
Valsterboen and the castle are one against another, then you are right against
the Sand.

When you are about Valsterboen Sand, you may sound there within it at four
fathom, along to the strand of Schoonen or old Valsterboen, Hul water.
where there lies a haven called Hul, or Hul-water, it is a deep haven for
common ships, and goes in at three or four fathom, and reaches in most
part northeast, you may sound in along by the foot-strand of Old Valsterboen
at three fathom, and you must leave Old Valsterboen on the right hand, it is
there wide and broad enough. But before or against Old Valsterboen there
lies a Sand called Zuydvliet, which you must remember to shun. Southvliet


From the tonne upon Valsterboen Sand to the tonne upon Draker sand the course
is north five leagues: but if you come out of the east, and come out by Steden,
Drakersand.
then go north and by east to Drakersand, and that is six leagues, and when
the steeple of Coppen haven comes upon the east end of the wood which
stands west from Draker, Marks of Draker sand.
then you have the length of the tonne upon Drakersand, then you may well set
your course upon Southolme, till you come before Draker, there you shall find
five fathom water a foot less, and that is the dryest of all the Middle
ground.

The south tonne of the Middle ground lies somewhat higher up to Draker: South
tonne, in the Middle ground
from the tonne upon Draker sand to the Suyder tonne north, and north and by
west.

Right over against this Zuyder tonne there lies a stone above the water,
which is called the Fisher, there you may sound the Southolme, for there it is
flat water. Fisher.


From the Zuyder tonne of the Middle ground, Casper Caniel tonne and the marks.
or the drought, to the tonne upon Casper Caniel, the course is north and north
and by west, there the Middleground is at the narrowest, and there it is
shoring on both sides, if you lavere through the shallowes, you must wind as
soon as it begins to dry, on the one or the other side. The marks of this
tonne upon Casper Caniel are these: when the sharp steeple of Coppen haven is
against the white castle, then you have the length of this tonne, and there it
is seven and eight fathom deep.

From the tonne at Casper Caniel to the Middle tonne, Middle tonne.
the course is north and by west: the southerlyest mill comes upon the
southende of the town, and the flat steeple comes within a lever or bow
length of the speere steeple of Coppen haven, these are marks of the Middle
tonne: it is there eight or nine fathom deep.

North tonne.
From the Middle tonne to the North tonne the course is north and by west, and
northnorthwest, there in the chanel it is nine and ten fathom deep, but the
tonne lies at six fathom, on the north end of the Middle ground.

From the north tonne to the Sond the course is north and by west, in that
chanel it is eight, nine and ten fathom deep: you may also run along by
the west side at six and seven fathom.

Rode under the Sond.
A man may anckor in the Sond where he will: all the ships for the most part
anckor commonly along by the land south from Elsenore, but with a southeast
wind it is badde lying there, for there it is fiveteene and sixteen fathom
deep, but to Weem there lies a banck or flat of seven, eight, or nine
fathom, there it is better lying, but it is somewhat far from the land.

II. How you shall sail out of the Sond through the shallowes, and so into
Reefshol.
ALthough I have here perfectly declared how you shall sail through the Sands
and Shallowes coming from Valsterboen to the Sond, yet I thought it not amiss
also to write, How a man coming north, or out of the Sond shall sail through
it, in regard that there passes so great a number of ships that way every
year, and for that it is so requisite and convenient to know the true and
perfect situation of that chanel.

North tonne.
If you will sail out of the Sond to the Shallowes and Sands, you must go south
and by east, or you may sound along by the wood at five or six fathom, then
you shall not in sailing miss the North tonne, for it lies at six fathom,
on the north end of the middle ground, east from the tonne it is seven fathom
deep, Marks of the north-tonne.
but in the right chanel against this tonne it is nine or ten fathom deep.
The marks of this tonne are, when the end of the wood is westsouthwest, and
the steeple of Coppen haven southwest from you, then you are against the north
to^ne, and there stands a flat steeple a certain space south from that
wood: also there come then three hillocks on the northside of the town, all
these are marks of the north tonne.

If you will sail to Reefshol or to Coppen haven, then ru^ne west about this
north tonne, To sail into Reefshol.
and go on southwest and by south and southsouthwest, till the tonne lies
east, and east and by north from you, there it will be four or five fathom
deep soft ground. The marks of Reefshol are these, there stand two or three
trees on the high land west from Coppen haven, they stand south from two or
three hillocks: when they come upon the uttermost trees which stand on the
northwest side of Coppens haven, then sail southwest and by south, till
Torenbuy or Amack be against the beacon, then go in south and by west, then a
steeple which stands cross within the land west from you, will come against
a great stone, then you are in the narrow where in times past the ships were
sonke, and you leave a wrack of a ship lying on the south land, and then the
beacon and the steeple of Amack are there long marks. Now to sail further
forward through that strait or narrow way, go in south and by west, and when
you are far enough in, you may anckor where you will, you lie there cross
the chanel with an anckor on the land, and another to Seaward.

To turn again to the Middle grounds or sands: Middle tonne.
from the North tonne to the Middle tonne, the course is south and by east, and
southsoutheast, when you come to the Middle tonne, then the southerlyest mill
being south from the town of Coppen haven, and the flat steeple come within
a leaver or bow length to the speere steeple, these are the marks of the
Middle tonne, or second tonne in the shallowes or Sands, and there it is eight
or nine fathom deep.

From the Middle tonne to the tonne upon Casper Caniel, Tonne on Casmer Caniel.
the course is south and by east, then the white castle comes over the sharp
steeple, and that is the mark of the third tonne, or the tonne upon Casper
Caniel, which is the south end of the Middle ground, there it is not very
wide, but shoring on both sides, the depth is seven or eight fathom. If you
will lavere there, you must wind as soon as it begins to dry on either of
the sides.

From the third tonne to the fourth, the course is south, Fourth tonne. The
Fisher.
and south and by east: this lies upon the north end of Draker upon the
flat, right over against it lies the Fisher, which is a stone (as I said
before) which lies above the water, there you may sound the Southolme, for
there it is flat water. Between this third and fourth tonne there comes a
chanel or haven running out from Coppen haven, which is called Casmer Caniel.
Casmer Caniel.


From the fourth or South tonne in the Middle ground to Draker sand the course
is south, and south and by east, you may sound the land of Draker at 3, 4 and 4
fathom and an half.

Draker sand lies a good way without Draker, and it reaches half a league
eastward into the Sea. Marks of the tonne upon Draker sand.
The marks of the to^ne at Draker sand are these: when the steeple of
Coppenhaven is south from Draker upon the wood, then you are against the tonne.
The dryest and shallowest water that you find is between this tonne upon
Draker sand, and the aforesaid fourth tonne, there it is 5 fathom less a
foot. When you are against the to^ne upon Draker sand, then go south and s.
and by w. to Valsterboens sand or to Steden, that is 5 leagues: but from the
tonne upon Draker sand to the Kuycke the course is s. w. six leagues. When
coming out of the Sond you are past the Sand of Valsterboen, then it is
somewhat deeper, when you follow your course to Borneholme, but coming from
the east then it begins speedely to be deeper when you are about the point of
the Sand: the further situation of Valsterboen is declared before.

III. How you may sail out of the Sond to Elleboghen, Malmuyen, and Landscrone.
IF you will sail out of the Sond to Elleboghen or Malmuyen, then from Ween
go s. e. and s. e. and by s. then you shall see the steeple or town lie
before you, sail to it, in that chanel it is for the most part 7 or 8 fathom
deep, but when you come within the Saltholmes, the^ it is 5 or 6 fathom
deep, the drougth soon rises from seven to five fathom, but before the
town it is flat water, there you may anckor at 3, 4 or 5 fathom as you
will, Rode before Malmuyen.
you may also lie at the end of the head at three fathom, there it is good
lying, but with a n. w. wind there it is bad rode, for it blows openly in.

If you will go out again south from the Southolmes to Valsterbon or Steden,
then you must take heed of the Southolms, they are soul round about, from the
north end there shoots a Sand something far out, on the east side, upon the
south end it runs out flat very far: and there also lies Nordvliet,
Nordvliet.
which is a stony Sand which lies under the warer, but you may see it lie
green under the water, which you must leave on the Southolmes side, that is on
starborde, Southvliet
but Southvliet which lies against old Valsterboen, you must leave on
baghborde, and so run through between them both, in that water at the dryest
it is four fathom deep. When you come from Malmuyen, and that the steeple of
Coppen haven comes upon the south end of Southolmes, then you are past by
Northvliet: as you sail through in this sort you must be very watchful, and
take heed of the grounds aforesaid.

You may also go out along by the strand of Schoonen, and leave both
Northvliet and Southvliet on starreborde, for you may sound that strand at four
and five fathom, as also the Sand of Valsterboen.

If you will sail into Landscrone you must understand that there lies a
shallowe Sand before the haven, Landscrone.
you must run south into it, there stands a church on the north side
somewhat forward, and a Gentleman's house somewhat further into the land, bring
the church against the house, then you are free from that Sand, then sail in
upon the point, and anckor at three fathom.

Thus the land of Schoonen shows, when you sail through the Sands, from Col
to Valsterboen.

IIII. The situation of the Sond to Col, and north from Zeeland to the Belt.
Col.
FRom Elsenore or the Sond to the point of Col the course is northwest, and
northwest and by west 4 or 5 leagues. About a quarter of a league north from
Elsenore lies Lappesand, Lappesand.
on the west side of the chanel, go no nearer to it then 7 fathom, and you
can not be hurt upon it. On the east side about half way between Col and
Elsenborch lie the Swyneboden, Swyneboden.
which reach off from the land a good way into the Sea, therefore when you are
at the end of Lappesand, then go n. w. and by w. till Col Huyberts comes out
before, and begineth to lie northnortheast from you, then go boldly northwest
and by north, and northnorthwest to the Sand of Anout, then you shall run
far enough without.

But if you will sail from Col to the Sond, then hold the Island of Ween hid
behind the Castle of Elsenor, How to shu^ne the Swyne boden.
for if you bring not Ween without the castle of Elsenor, then you cannot
sail under the Swyneboden: when you are past the Swynboden, then you may sail
forward in the middle of the water about Lappesand: and when you are within the
castle, then you may anckor where you will, as I said before. Between Col and
Zeeland it is sixteen, seventeene, eighteen, and in some places twenty
fathom deep, but in the night come no nearer to Zeeland then twelve,
thirteen or fourteen fathom, for at that depth you are close by the land:
for on Zeland side it is very shoring.

Haselin.
From Col to the Island Haselin it is southwest and by west eight leagues. From
the east end of Haselin there reaches out a Sand northeast and by north: a
great league from the end of the Sand lie the Luysgrounds, Luysgrounds.
and lie from the south end of Anout distant northwest and by west and
southeast and by east: and from Col east and by south and west and by north,
there the water is no deeper then eight foot. When you come from Anout sand,
and will go to the Sond, then go no southerlyer then southsoutheast, and so
you shall not undersayle these grounds, for with a south and east course you
should sail by them, when you come from Anout sand: but coming out of the
Sond you should undersayle those Luysgrounds with a westnorthwest course.
Therefore if you will sail to the Sond from Anout, or from the Sond to Anout
with a sharp wind you must be careful to remember them, and to take heed of
them.

Rode under Haselin.
The Island Haselin on the outside is all foul and full of Sands and shallowes,
but on the Zeland side it is indifferent fair, there you may run under to
anckor. The coast of Zeeland is a fair strand, and you may run through
between Haselin and Zeeland to the Belt, but a little west from Haselin there
shoots off a Sand from Zeeland, which you must shun.

About eastsoutheast from Haselin there lies a great wide river, which without
in the beginning is at least a league wide, it is there good anckoring against
a northeast wind at five or six fathom. This River devideth it self into
three parts in the land of Zeeland: the first or easterlyest goes up
southsoutheast to Roskild: the second goes up to Isiebie and Holbecke, there
there lies a great Island in the middle, and within it is three leagues broad,
this River is called Isenvoort, reaching into the land south, Isenvorde.
and south and by west six or seven leagues. The third River reaches to
Draecxholme also five leagues southwest and northeast, so that in Draecxholme
you may see the Sea, this river stretches as the Seacoast does along to the
Belt.

Thus Zeeland shows it self when you come from Anoult sailing to the Sond.
view of Zealand

V. The situation between Col and Waersberghen.
FRom Col to the Island Swederoer it is northeast and by north, there you may
go northward in behind, Swedere.
there it is wide and broad, and between the great and small rocks you may
anckor at seven fathom, against the church of Turko, which is a white church,
it is good to come in there, you may there go southward out again, leaving
the two rocks with the warders on starreborde, and run right up to Col close
about the rocks. If you come from Anout, and by means of southerly winds can
not get above Col, you must go from Col northeast and by north to Swederoer,
and go close in by the two rocks whereon the warders stand, there it is soft
ground so that you must look to your anckors: a north wind blows openly
into it.

Between Col and Swederoer there is a great creek, and there lies the town
of Engelholme, there also you may anckor. Engleholme.


North from Swederoer there goes in another great creek, wherein Bos-stadt
lies, three leagues east from Swederoer, Bos-stadt* Laholme.
and a league easterlyer lies the town or castle called Laholme, and there
also goes a River into the land.

Three leagues northward from Laholme lies Helm^te upon a current or falling
water, Helmste.
but there may nothing but boyers and small boats go into it.

Three leagues westward from Helmste lies the Island Tullo, which lies
northnorthwest about five leagues from Swederoer: The Island Tullo.
inward to the land against this Island there lies a high hill, which shows
white, as if it were sandy land, it is called Haver, but by Sailors it is
called Young Col, Young Col.
because it is like Col for height and fashion, and sometimes also it is taken
for Col.

Three leagues north from Tullo lies the River of Valckenborch: on the north
side thereof there lies an Island called Muruptinge.

And three leagues more north from the River of Valckenborch lies
Waersberghen, Valckenburgh.
which is distant from Col north and by west, and south and by east twelve or
thirteen leagues. To sail into Waersberghen then run in by the east side,
To sail into Waersbergen.
but right upon the point of the Island there lies a rock under the water, and
from the point whereon the castle stands, there also lies a blind rock,
which you must shun, and go in the middle of the water, between the Island
and the Maie-land, and anckor against the castle at four or five fathom, there
within it is all flat water. To sail otherwise into Waersberghen set
Outboy north from the castle, and go in northnortheast, there lies a Rock
there even with the water, you must leave it on starreborde, and anckor below
the castle at four fathom.

Thus the land of Waersberghen shows, when you sail by Anout to the Sond.
view of 'Waersberghen' (town in Sweden)

VI. The situation between Waersberghen and Masterland.
THree leagues north from Waersberghen lies Monstersond, Monstersond.
which is a River, which reaches up into the land: upon it there lie some
towns, as Vlymenes, Horn and Goeswaer.

Nydingh.
From Waersberghen to Nyding the course is northwest five leagues: it is a very
badde rock, it lies even above the water, so that the water almost strikes
over it: every man must take heed of it.

Malesond.
A great league northeast and northeast and by east from Nydingh there lies an
Island called Malesond, it is a round Island, you may sail round about it at
seven or eight fathom, and under it also it is good anckoring. Two cables
length westnorthwest from Malesond lies a blind rock, and there lies another
rock a bow shot from the land even with the water, on it there stands a
beacon, and upon the Mayeland there stand two great beacons each upon a rock,
between them both there goes in a haven, which lies eastnortheast from
Malesond, it is a fair haven of ten fathom deep, there is good anckor
ground, Consback
about the low point you may see Consback lie north from you, you may run in
between Ning or Nydingh and the firm land, for there also it is flat water.

Wynno.
From Malesond to Wynno the haven of Niloos the course is northnorthwest three
leagues. By Wynno you go into the River of Niloos, Reefsond.
the haven is called Reefsond, there lies a rough Island, which you must leave
on baghborde, and the long rock on starreborde, and so you must run in
through the rocks by the rugged Island, there are no blind rocks which you
need to fear* When you come within the rugged Island, then you may anckor
there behind or within at twenty fathom. The south chanel reaches in
northnorthwest, it is wide and broad and goes in at eight, nine and ten
fathom.

From Reef^ond to Calfsond it is northnorthwest four leagues: you must sail
into it south from a great rock, Calfsond.
whereon there stands a beacon, south from the Haven there are many great
rocks, and northward they are small rocks: now when you are within the
rocks, about the point of the north land, there you may anckor at fiveteene or
sixteen fathom, for there it is good anckor ground. From Calfsond you go
forward to Bahuys, and then you leave Connel on the left hand: Bahuys. Connel.
you may also go within the rocks from Calfsond to the river of Nyleus.

Masterland and Calfsond lie about four leagues distant. M^sterland.
If you will sail from Schagen to Masterland, then go eastnortheast, then you
shall see a round rock or hill called Bretto, Bretto hill.
when that is eastnortheast from you, and you sail right upon it then you come
open before Masterland, and then you see the Paternosters lie before you, which
is a heap of out-rockes, Paternosters.
which reach far out into the Sea, leave them on baghborde, and sail along
by them eastnortheast, and east and by north, till you come by the Island of
Masterland, and when you come to the land then the River will open, which
reaches in by the south side most east and by south and eastsoutheast, and
when you are within the Island where the mast or beacon with the barrel upon it
stands, then turn up southward behind it, and anckor before the town, for
then you may see it lie before you: there you put an anckor out before to
seaward, and make a rope fast upon the Kaye, lying also with the stern of the
ship at the Kaye.

You may go into the Sea again through the south chanel close along by the
rock, South chanel.
which lies in the middle of the chanel above the water: you may go about on
both sides of this rock: but within the rock which lies above the water, there
lies a blind rock, and on the south side there lies a great rock, that lies
somewhat more outward then that which lies above it: and there lies also a
blind rock under the water on the Island, upon the north side of the rock which
lies in the chanel. The chanel reaches in most east and east and by north,
there all about it is good anckor ground, and you may also sail within through
the rocks to the havens or rivers of Bahuys and Nileus.

Thus the land shows between Waersberghen and Masterland.

view of Sweden

VII. The situation between Col and Schaghen.
ANout sand and Col lie distant from each other northwest and southeast about
eleven leagues, you may easily see them both upon the hatches of the ship in
clear wether, when you are between them: in that chanel it is twenty and
two-and-twentie fathom deep.

From Anout sand to Zeeland the course is southsoutheast twelve or thirteen
leagues. Between Anout and Zeeland it is fiveteene and sixteen fathom deep.

Anout sand is very shoring, and reaches from Anout about eastnortheast into
the Sea: but when you come out of the west you may sound it at seventeene or
eighteen fathom, but when you come out of the Sond with a sharp wind then
you can not sound it. On the north side of Anout you may ancker at ten or
eleven fathom, so that then you may shun the Sand to go to the Sond.

Between Col and Anout there lies a banck which is no deeper then seven or
eight fathom, sometimes the stream raveleth much thereon. There lies another
banck between the banck of Anout and Valkenborch of twelve fathom, which
reaches to Haland, which also in some places is no deeper then eight fathom a
little south from Anout sand.

Between Anout and Waersberghen in the chanel it is two-and twenty fathom
deep, but there also there lies a banck between them both of ten fathom
deep: when you are forced to lie by a wind between Anout and Lesou, and that
you find twenty fathom deep, then you must know that you begin to fall
near to Norwaie side: but when you run westward and find but twelve,
thirteen, fourteen and fiveteene fathom, then you must know that you are
toward the Iutsche or Anout side, then you must wind again toward Norwaie:
but where the bancks aforesaid lie is declared before, there you must look to
it passing to and again over it, least thereby you should err and go out of
the way. If you must be forced to laveere between Lesou and Anout, or
between the Sond and Schaghen by night or in mistie wether, you must not spare
your lead: the chanel for the most part is twenty, one-and-twentie,
two-and-twentie and three-and-twentie fathom deep. Between Anout and Lezou
in the right chanel it is five-and-twentie fathom deep: but right between
Anout and Lezou it is flat water, of seven or eight fathom. There you may
sail through between them both, till you come to the Belt. Anout on the west
side is very foul, and full of Dwalegrounds of two or three fathom.

From the Sand of Anout to the Trindle it is northwest ten or eleven leagues.
Trindle*
The Trindle lies northeast from the north end of Lezou three leagues, upon
it is about eight foot water, but as some say but four foot. It is stony sand
ground, and a Flat in bigness as much as two Morgens of land, Lezou.
it lies extended along the chanel, and on the northeast side there lies a
tonne upon it. From Lezou there comes a Flat toward the Trindle, which you
may sound at three or four fathom. When you sail through between Lezou and
the Trindle, then the nearer to the Trindle you have the deeper water, that is
5, 6 and 7 fathom: spare not your lead by night about the Trindle, nor come no
nearer unto it on the out side then 9 or 10 fathom.

What may be said more of the Trindle, as also of the full situation of the
Island Lezou, with the bancks and Flats shooting out from it, and how you may
sail forward to Schaghen, and so about it, I have already declared it at
large in the fourth Chapter of this Book, whereunto I refer the Reader, and
leave it here as needelesse to be rehearsed again.

VIII. How the streams run in these places.
THrough the Sands and the Sond the stream commonly goes with the wind, but
most about the North, when a hard east wind blows; and then the stream
runs out north.

Between Waersberghen and Masterland in the chanel, the stream also goes
most with the wind, and it raveleth there sometimes upon certain places as if
they were Sands: this you may see in calm wether, when you let a lead sink
upon the ground.

By Schaghen the stream commonly comes falling out of the Belt, and falls
to the Northeast land, specially when the wind has for a while blown out of
the east or northeast: if you come from Anout, and will sail to Schaghen by
night with a west wind, or coming out of the west about Schaghen with a
southerly wind you would with those streams soon be driven under Norwaie,
before you should once think or imagine so much.

To conclude, in this chanel of Valsterboen, and from Steden to the Sond, and
forth from the Sond to Schaghen it behooveth a Master or Pilot of a ship to
be very circumspect, and not to be careless or negligent to shun all the
dangers of the multitude of foul Sands, Rocks and Shallowes which are
therein, and about the same: therefore he that will use these Seas must be
very wary, for that one that is well acquainted with them has enough to do
to look to himself.

Thus the Island of Anout shows when you come from Lezou.
view of 'Anout' (island in Denmark)

Thus Lezou shows when you come from Schaghen.

IX. How these Lands and places are distant from each other.
FRom the tonne upon Valsterboen sand to the tonne on Draker sand south and
north 5 leagues. From Steden to the tonne upon Draker sand north and by east 6
leagues. The tonnes in the Sands or Shallowes how they lie distant is already
showed. From the north tonne in the Shallowes to the Sond north and by west 7
leagues. From the Kuycke to the tonne upon Drakersand northeast 6 leagues. From
Steden to Malmuyen northnortheast 8 leagues. From Malmuyen to Reefsholme west 5
leagues. From Malmuyen to Weeme northwest and northwest and by north 7 leagues.
From Lantscrone to Elsenore westnorthwest 3 leagues. From Ween to Lappesand
northnorthwest 3 leagues. From Elsenore or Lappesand to Col northwest and
northwest and by north 5 leagues. From Col to Engleholme east 4 leagues. From
Engleholme to Tuerko northwest 4 leagues. From the point of Tuerco behind
Swederoer to Laholme eastnortheast 3 leagues. From Laholme to Tuylo northwest
and by west 5 leagues. From Tuylo to Waersberghen norhwest 5 leagues. From
Waersberghen to Malesond n. n. w. 5 leagues. From Malesond to Winno
northnorthwest 3 leagues. From Winno to Masterland northwest 5 leagues. From
Masterland to the west end of the Paternosters westsouthwest 3 leagues. From
the point of Col to Haselin s. w. and by w. 8 leagues. From Col to the
out-point of Zeeland southwest 5 leagues. From Col to the south end of Swedero
northeast 4 leagues. From Col to Waersberghen north and by west 12 leagues.
From Waersberghen to Nydingh northwest 5 leagues. From Nydingh to Malesond n.
e. and n. e. and by e. 1 league. From Nydingh to Masterland northnorthwest 8 or
9 leagues. From Col to the Sand of Anout northwest 10 or 11 leagues. From
Haselin to Anouts sand north 11 leagues. From the Sand of Anout to the Trindle
northwest 11 leagues. From the Trindle to Schagen sand northwest 8 leagues. But
from within the Trindle to the sand of Schagen northwest and by north also 8
leagues. When you come from Schagen and will go without about the Trindle the
course is southeast and by east 8 leagues. From the north end of the Sand of
Lesou to Schagen the course is northnorthwest 8 leagues.
XI. Cross courses in Schaghen Reach.
FRom Waersberghen to Anoult or Anouts Sand southwest 10 leagues. From
Waersberghen to Lesou west 16 leagues. From Waersberghen to the Trindle west
and by north distant 13 leagues. From Waersberghen to Schagen is the course
westnorthwest 19 or 20 leagues. From Nydingh to Schagen west and by north
distant about 15 or 16 leagues. From Nileus to Schaghen west 15 leagues. From
Masterland to Lezou southwest, and southwest and by south 13 or 14 leagues.
From Masterland to Schagen westsouthwest 12 leagues. And how the most part of
the places and havens of Norwaie are distant from Schagen it is already set
down in the third Chapter, and also in the Chapter ensewing.
Here follows the Card N. 30.

CHAPTER XI. A DESCRIPTION OF the Coasts of Norwaie, lying between Masterland
and the Neus.
I. The situation between the Paternosters and the Island Farther.
Behind the Paternosters (as I showed in the Chapter before) there goes a
broad River into the land, whereon the round hill of Britto lies, Britto hill.
which is a hill very well to be known: when it is eastnortheast from you,
then you are right before Masterland.

North upward from this River lies Kerckesond a great River which reaches far
into the land. Kerckesond.


Harmensond. Harmenshooft.
Three leagues north from Kerckesond lies Harmensond, and by it there lies an
Island called Harmenshooft.

Harmenshooft and the west end of the Paternosters lie di-distant north and by
west, and south and by east five leagues.

Boochscharre.
From Harmenshooft to Suyderwicxholme the course is northnorthwest four or five
leagues, between them both lies Boochscharre.

Suyderwicholme.
Suyderwicxholme and Noderwixholme are two great Islands, which lie upon a great
River, which runs up far into the land, whereon many towns lie, which
are also far up in the land, as Oldborch, Oldwat, Aleroes and Dragens, from
whence much fat wares come. Ottrom.
North from thence lies Ottrom, which also is a great River or Creek,
reaching into the land.

Akersond.
West from Ottrom lies the Island of Akersond, which you may sail round about.
The Island of Akersond lies from Zuyderwicxholme northwest and by west five
leagues.

Schip hill.
By Akersond north from Ottrom lies Schiphill, it is a haven where men lade
sparres and other fat wares.

The Sisters
From Akersond to the Sisters it is west and by north four leagues: between
them both lies Graswick: When you sail into it then you leave the sharp
point on baghborde, Graswick.
and within there lies a round rock, there is good anckor ground: you may go
about on both sides of this rock. North from this rock there lies a great
Creek, where ships lie in for the wind, and within also there lies a round
rock, run along by the west side, which first reaches in north, and about
the Island northnorthwest, leave the Island on starreborde, and then go in
northnorthwest by the west side.

Behind the Sisters lies Elsange: Elsange.
when you come from Farther, then you run through within the rocks which lie
within the Sisters, till you be against the land, then you see a great graye
rock, which you must leave on baghborde, and the small rocks that lie there
within on starborde, then go about by the west side of the land, and then you
shall see the haven open, which is narrow, but within it is flat water and
soft ground.

North from Elsanghe lies the point of Roge: Roge.
at the east end of Roge you may anckor, there it is a smooth strand, and you
may go through between Roge and the Calf. But if you will be under Fleto,
then go through between the two small rocks. The point of Roge lies distant
from the Island Farther northnortheast five leagues.

From the Sisters to the Island Bast it is northwest five leagues. Bast.
But Farther and Bast are distant north and by west, and south and by east also
five leagues.

From Bast to the Soenwater it is north and by east and northnortheast four
leagues, between them both lies a foul point: Markenboet. Asko. Lousond.
Soenwater.
and south from Bast lies Markenboet, and south from it lies Asko, which is a
creek, and north from Asko lies Lousond.

From Farther to Soenwater it is north. When you sail from Farther or Bast to
Soenwater there lies a red point between Soenwater and Coperwick: but if
you will put into Coperwick you must turn up westward, Coperwick.
when you are within the Lammeren, there stands a church on the west land,
there is the lading place: you may sail further upward to Brakenesse, Holmson
and on the north side Holmsond lies. Soenwater reaches in for the most part
north, upon it there lie many havens and lading places, Mossond.
most on the right side as you come in: first Mossond, which goes up eastward:
Wickste. Schiphil.
then Wickste behind an Island, it is a creek: then Schiphill, which also is a
Sand-baye, but it is a good rode: It goes up northward to Anslo, Ansloe.
then it runs southward into the Bodem.

Upon the coast between Masterland and Farther it is all over for the most part
good ancker ground at five-and-thirtie and forty fathom.

Thus the Land of Northeast shows it self between Masterland and
Zuyderwicxholme being four leagues from it, as you sail along by it.

II. The situation between Farther and Langhesond.
West from the Island of Farther there lies a town in a great Creek called
Tonsberghen. Tonsberghen.


From Farther to Larwick the course is westsouthwest four leagues. Larwick is a
great broad River, wherein there are many lading places and Creekes, Larwick.
where you may ancker. From the east point of Larewick there runs a row of
rocks, which reach southeast and by south a good way into the Sea, which you
must shun, for they run almost over half the Creek: the rocks are called
the Larewicsche Swynen: within it it is flat shallowe water, so that far
there within it no great ships can lie aflote, the havens of Larewick are all
firrwood havens.

Stavange.
On the west side of Larewick Stavange lies which are rocks, there you may
sail in on both sides.

A league west from Stavange lies the Nesse, which is the east point of
Langesond. From Farther to Langesond it is westsouthwest eight leagues.

Langesond.
Langesond is one of the fairest havens of all Norwaie: before old Langesond
there lies a high round rock, whereon there stands a great round mast or
beacon to know Langesond by. Conincxhaven or the River of Langesond goes
northnorthwest in by a rough rugged point, Conincxhaven.
and then you go in east from the Baerse, Baerse.
which lies off from the aforesaid rugged point, within that haven it is
thirty fathom deep: when you sail in keep in the middle of the water, and
ancker in Conincx-haven at eight-and-twentie or thirty fathom. If you will
go into the Nesse, The Nesse.
then sail between the great rock whereon the mast stands, and the land of
Old Langesond, leaving the said rock on starreborde, and sail so about the
rugged point into the Nesse. The Nesse lies behind a Cingle strand, you lie
under a row of Rocks like read sand, there lie some small rocks against
this Cingle, there it is wide and broad, Strand like a girdle.
and a good haven to come into, there it is four-and-twentie and
five-and-twentie fathom deep.

Thus the land east from Langesond shows being five leagues from you, when
you come out of the west.

III. The situation of the Havens and Rivers, between Langesond and Maerdou.
FRom Langesond to Iofferland the course is southsouthwest a great league,
Iofferla^d. Aberfort.
between them both lies Abbefoert and Ostkiel, and east from the out-rock of
Iofferland you may go into the two havens. Ostkiel.
From the northerlyest rocks of Iofferland to Abbefort the course is
northnorthwest and north-and by west a league, and to Ostkiel is the course
also northwest a league. When you come out of the south, you may go within
Iofferland through to Ostkiel, or Abbefoert: you may also anck^r behind
Iofferland at fiveteene and twenty fathom.

West from Iofferland there lie Westkiel, Santfort and Longen. If you will go
into Westkiel, Westkiel.
you must leave all the great rocks which lie off from Iofferland on
starborde, and so sail upon the west end of the haven, leaving all the small
rocks of Santfort on baghborde, and sail in northnorthwest till you be about
the west point, and then turn up northwest. On the north side of the Islands
which lie within the haven, there is a ditch or falling water, where you may
ancker at twenty or five-and-twentie fathom.

Santfort.
Santfort lies a league west from Westkiel: if you will sail into Sandfort,
leave all the small rocks on starborde, and so go along by the land, till you
be within the Longholmes, which remain on baghborde, and go right into the
Wike. This is a fair haven, and you may go from the east into it.

A banck by Santfort.
Against Santfort there lies a banck into the Sea, which in some places is no
deeper then three or four fathom, and it ends at Westkiel.

Longhen.
A great league west from Sandvort lies Longhen, there lies a round Island or
rock before it, and thereon there stands a mast with a barrel: this Island or
rock with the mast lies upon the east side of the haven, keep along by the
land whereon the mast with the barrel stands, and sail in close by the
barrel, for there stands a hand on starreborde of the haven, which shows
you, that there lies a blind rock under the water, that there you might turn
somewhat from it: this haven is narrow, and a short chanel to come into: now
when you are within you may go eastward again into the Sea, and come out
again to the river of Santfort.

A league west from Longhen lies the haven of Oxefort, Oxfort.
it is a wide haven, and runs in first north, there lies a long rock west
from the haven, leave that on baghborde, and go north till you be about the
west point of the land: when you are a little way within the long rock, there
lies a blind rock under the water, which you must leave on starborde, and on
the west point also there lies a blind rock, which you must shun. When you
are there within, then you must sail in northwest and by north and northwest,
and ancker upon the north side of the haven, there it is wide and broad, and
there are many creekes, wherein you may lie at twenty and five-and-twentie
fathom, there you may ancker where you think good.

When you are before Longhen and Oxefort, then the Drommels lie westnorthwest
from you.

About a league west from Oxford Tromsond goes in, east from the white church
which stands on the Sea side, Tromsond
about half a league east from Mardou: it is a fair river. You must sail in
behind the land of Mardou into the haven of Mardou, there stand two masts or
beacons upon the east or north side of the haven upon a high hill, you must
sail in by them, and there also you may ancker.

Thus the land between Mardou and Langhesond shows, when you come out of the
west, and are five leagues from the land almost against Longhen.

Drommels. Hill north from the Drummel. East-drommels. The land of Westkiel.

view of Norway

IIII. The situation between Mardou and Vlecker.
THe Island of Mardou on the top is full of green trees, and round about it
is all bare rocks, The Island Mardou.
on each side of the Island there goes in a haven: the east haven of Mardou
reaches in w. s. w. there lies a blind rock on the right hand as you go in,
but you must go close in by the Island of Mardou, the haven is no deeper then
three fathom, and you may ancker under the Hand at 12 or 13 fathom, you may
also go up into the river. The west haven goes in on the west side of the
Island, you must leave Mieuholme on baghborde, and go in n. n. e. and so sail
behind the Island, or else go up the river, and there ancker on the west side.
From the west end of the Island of Mardou there lies a rock under the water,
which you must shu^ne, when you go into the west haven. When you are before
Mardou the Drommels lie n. w. from you, Dro^mels.
but when you are right before the land or tne haven you cannot see the
Drommels.

West from Mieuholme there lie many read rocks: west from thence you go into
Hesnes, Hesnes. Kercksond.
and half a league westerlyer lies Kercksond: upon the Island of Hesnes there
stand two beacons or masts, and there it is very deep, but to Kercken it is
shallower, there it is 30 fathom deep, and the outrockes there are all read.
On the west side of the haven lies a rock under the water called Coenagle:
there stand two masts upon the land, when they are one against the other, then
you are against the Coenagles. The two masts aforesaid stand upon the graie
holme, leave them on starborde, and so go inwards, there it is high land, and
the Drommels lie about n. n. w. from you: you may sail from thence within the
rocks to Mardou.

Two leagues west from Hesnes lies Hamersond: the haven of Hamersond reaches
in northnortheast, Hamersond.
and you may ancker behind the Island against the beacon at thirty fathom.
The east haven of Hamersond reaches both in and out northwest and southeast,
and there lies a rock on the west side with a mast or beacon upon it.

Old Hilsond.
West from Hamersond you go into the Old Hilsond: if you will go into Old
Hilsond, you must go in east from the rocks of Blindsond, which lie on the
west side of Old Hilsond. Before Old Hilsond there lie many great rocks, and
there stand two or three mastes upon them all, which you must leave upon
starborde, and go in (as I said before) by the west side, you may turn
westwards up about the point, and sail through between the Islands, that you
may see no Sea, you may there go into what River you will, they are all fair
Rivers to go into. The Island of Blindsond lies on the point of the west side
of Old Hilsond. Blindsond


You shall know the Island of Wolfsond thus: they are all high graie rocks,
Wolfsond.
and there stand three or four mastes upon them. Wolfsond has two havens: the
east haven reaches in northwest, and then you must leave the great round high
rock whereon the mast stands on the west side: the west haven is a narrow
haven to go into, it goes in upon the north side of Reperwick, there stand
two stenges or masts upon the land, which you must leave on baghborde, and
there you must go in close by them, and on starborde there lie a company of
small rocks, you must go in by them, and sail behind the Island whereon the
great masts stand, and there ancker, there you lie safe against all winds, and
you may also run there within the rocks, and come out again into the Sea by
Old Hilsond, or you may also go out of the east haven of Wolfsond, which you
will.

Reperwick haven goes in right west from Wolfsond north, and north and by
west, it is a fair wide haven, you must sail in by the land of Wolfsond, and
leave all the rocks of Wolfsond whereon the masts stand on starreborde, and
all the great rocks of Ransond on baghborde, and so go in behind into the
haven, and then turn up westward, and there ancker, there is the rode, and a
fair haven for ships that will go west.

Thus the land shows between Mardou or the Drommels and Vlecker, when you
come out of the west, and sail along by it.

Vleckereur. The Boot. Wolfsond Hamersond.

view of Norway

V. How you shall sail into Vlecker and the havens between Vlecker and the
Neus.
West from Coperwick lies Vleckeroer, which also has two havens to go into,
Vlecker.
the east haven of Vlecker goes in west from the point of Ransond
westnorthwest: when you are before the east haven of Vlecker, then you may see
full into the Vosse, when you sail into it you leave all the black rocks on
starborde, and the great graie rocks with the Island whereon the two mastes
stand on baghborde, and go in by them, leaving them on baghborde, then you
must turn up westward to Dievenholme, and there ancker west in the Sandbaye.

When you are before the east haven of Vlecker there lies a round hill, called
the Omgekeerde Boot, it strikes out above all the land against Hamersond, when
you come out of the west, Omghekeerde Boot.
then you see three high lands lying inward to the land, which when they come
toward the Drommels by little and little vanish away.

The west haven of Vlecker reaches in northnorthwest, when you come from
Heylighesond you may see the river open, and you may sail by the rocks and
scharres of Heylighesond, along into that Island, you must ancker on the west
land within Dievenholme whereon the gallows stand, at fiveteene, sixteen and
twenty fathom.

You may go again from thence through that east haven into the Sea* and leave
the Island with the mastes and all the great rocks on starborde, and all the
black rocks on baghborde.

Heylighesond.
On the Island of Heylighesond there stand two great mastes, you must go
westward into the Island til you be in, and you must ancker under the aforesaid
Island, whereon the mastes stand, there runs a great river into the land,
there you may sail in, for there the ships lade.

Scheersond or Westerrysen.
Four leagues west from Heylighesond you go into Scheersond or Westerrysen, you
must leave Sparrels on the left hand, and all the great holmes or rocks on
starborde, and so you must go in.

A little east from the Neus lies a rock with two mastes called Melin: Melin.
a little easterlyer from that there lies another rock, whereon also there
stands a mast, which rock is called Sparrels, Sparrels.
between these two out-rockes you must go into the Cloof, or the Cow and the
Calf, which are two well known round hillocks, Cow and Calf.
lying in the land of the Neus, when you come against Sparrels, there lies a
blind rock under the water, but when you are within Sparrels, then there lies
a rock above the water, which you must leave on baghborde, then the haven will
by little and little open unto you, and then you are against the Clofe, and then
turn up westward about the point, and ancker there in the Sandbaye at
fiveteene or sixteen fathom, then the Cow and the Calf will be about
northnortheast from you.

Right west from the point of Neus, there goes in a haven which is called
Selloer or Manesond: Sellore or Manesond.
if you will sail into the east chanel of Manesond, you must beware of the
Bishops boeden (lying in the middle of the River) and leave them on baghborde,
and go along in by the land of the Neus, until you come a little within
Bishops boeden, Bishops boeden.
there you shall find a rock under the water, which you must shun, and
ancker right against the white church within the said rock: but if you will go
in at the west or north chanel, then you must go north about the out-rocks,
and sail upon the south end of the low land to Leest, and go in by it, but
you must take heed of the rocks, which lie off from the innermost Island,
under the water on starborde: now when you are against or within Bishops
boeden, then it will there be nine fathom deep, there you may ancker, or if
you will go further in, then sail upon the said white church, which stands
on the north side, and ancker there where you will.

You may also go in east, behind the low land of Leest, but it is a whole
land.

East from the Neus the high land of Spangher lies, The high land of Spangher.
which is a land very well to be known.

Thus the land of Norwaie shows between the Neus and Vlecker, when you come
out of the west, and are five leagues from it.

VI. Of the falling of the streams along these Coasts.
ALthough the water upon the coasts of Norwaie falls up and down, yet it
holds no certain tide: some time of the year, and specially in the fore
part thereof there goes so stiff a stream about the west, along by the coast
of Norwaie, that a ship lying by the wind with a southwest stream, cannot
drive downwards if it may bear sail, and the nearer you are under the coast
of Norwaie, there you find the harder stream. This stream comes in that
sort falling out of the Belt against the Land of northeast, and turns in that
sort along by the coast of Norwaie into the north Sea: but between Farther and
Masterland it is for the most part all anckor ground at 35 and 40 fathom.

VII. How these Places are distant one from the other.
FRom the west end of the Paternosters to Harmenshooft north and by west 5
leagues. From Harmenshooft to Zuyderwicxholme northnorthwest 4 or 5 leagues.
From Zuyderwicxholme to Akersond n. w. and by w. 5 leagues. From Akersond to

westsouthwest 8 leagues.
VIII. How these Lands are distant from other Lands.
HOw all these havens of Norwaie are distant from Schaghen and the Holmes in
Iutland, both for length and wideness, you find it in the third Chapter of
this Book described at large. From der Neus to Schaghen east 33 leagues. From
der Neus to Holmes in Iutland s. e. 19 or 20 leagues. From der Neus to
Bovenberghen s. e. and by s. 24 leagues. From der Neus to Holy land s. and by
e. and s. s. e. 67 or 68 leagues From der Neus to the Eems south and somewhat

CHAPTER XII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Norwaie, from the Neus to the
City of Berghen.
I. The situation between the Neus and Schuytenes or the Liet or Haven of
Berghen.
IN the Description made before I have sufficiently declared how you shall
sail from the west and north into the Havens of the Neus or Maensond.

Winfort.
Three or four leagues north from the low land of Leest lies the Island of
Winfort, and southward from thence you go into the haven or Winfort, which
reaches in northeast: but between Winforde and the low land of Leest there
lies another fair haven called Winterford.

A league to seaward from the Island of Winfort there lie two out-rockes,
Focksteenes.
which are called the Focksteenes, the one lies nearer to the land then the
other.

Berchsond
North from the Island of Winfort you go into Berghsond, which haven reaches in
e. n. e. along by the aforesaid great Island, and you may ancker at the end of
the Island.

Ekesond.
Three leagues north from Berghsond lies Ekesond a good haven, there you go in
north from all the out-rockes, and you may ancker on the north side, for there
is best anckering.

North or west from Ekesond there lies a haven called Serenooch, Serenooch
north from that there is a white strand, where there stands a church upon an
out-point, and also there lies a high rock called Walbert, whereon there
stands a mast or beacon. From that rock there shoots out a stone Sand or
shelf, Walbert.
and on this white strand there is a Las or Salmon fishing.

The Iedder.
The aforesaid high rock called Walbert lies right over against the south end
of Iedder or the high land of Leest. The land of Iedder is at least five
leagues long, without any havens, on each end of this land there stands a
church, and from each end also there shoots off a Sand: the northerlyest
Sand reaches northwest into the Sea, and an half league northnorthwest from
the said Sand there lies a rock or Island named Rut, ^ut.
which you may go about on both sides. Cross from Rut to Seaward lies the
Vesteene, Vesteene.
about five leagues north from the Iedder.

About three leagues northnorthwest from the Vesteene there lies an Island
whereon a church stands called Wittinghs: Wittinghs eye.
but northnortheast from the Vesteene four leagues there lies an Island before
the haven or river of Stavanger called Sibrichtsteen. Sibrichsteene.


If you will sail into Stavanger, coming out of the south, sail through
between the Vesteen and the Maieland, leaving the foresaid Rock called Rut on
starborde, but take good heed of the stone Shelf, which reaches off from the
north end of Iedder, sail so inward till the Vesteen be southeast from you,
then go in northeast to the point of Tonghenes, Tonghenes.
which is a long point and low land, and lies on the south end of the River:
now when you sail from the Vesteene to Tonghenes, then you shall see the Island
Sibrichsteen before the River, which opens it self into two parts, leave it
on baghborde, and sail in by the point of Tonghenes, but there lies a rock
northward from the point: sail through between this rock and the point, about
east and eastsoutheast into Doeswick, and when you are within the castle of
Doeswick there you may ancker. Doeswick
But if you will sail forward before the town of Stavangher, Stavanghes.
then leave Diefsholme on starborde, and sail in southeast, and
southsoutheast, till you be before the town, and there ancker where you will.

But when you come out of the north and will sail to Stavangher, then go
between the Vesteen and Whitings eye, and then go on northeast to
Sibrichsteen and the point of Tonghenes, and do as I said before.

From Vesteen to Schuytenes it is northnorthwest five leagues. But from
Schuytenes to Sibrichsteen, through between Whitings eye it is east and west
five leagues.

Four leagues west and west and by north to seaward from Schuytenes there lie
certain rocks called the Wtsiers.

II. How you may sail up the Liet van Berghen from Schuytenes to Berghen.
THe Liet goes in between the Island of Schuytenes and Bock, when Bock lies
northeast from you, then you are right open before the Liet, Schuytenes lies
on the west side, and Bock on the east side, and reaches in first north and
north and by west three leagues to Perdeholme, or the great warder or mast, and
there is good rode against the foresaid warder or mast. From Perdeholme to
Vlocx it is north and north and by west three or four leagues. The Vlocx lies
right without Longhol, which is a good haven, you lie there with an anckor to
Sea, and a rope fast on the land, there it is fiveteene fathom deep.

Over against the Vlocx lies Bommel haven, there also is a a good Rode.

Bommelsond.
Bommel or Bommelsond goes into the Sea by Bommel head, which is a high rock,
which lies on the north side of the haven, but on the south side there lie
many small rocks, which as you go out you must leave on baghborde: the haven
reaches southwest, and southwest and by west into the Sea.

From Vlocx to Bremerholme or Dievenholme the course is northnorthwest three
leagues. Bremerholme or Dievenholme. Monsterhaven. Roteholme. Soltmer. Syck.
West or south from thence lies Monsterhaven, there stands a church, and
there it is good rode for ships that will go up and down the Liet.

From Bremerholme to Rootholme it is northnorthwest four leagues: under
Rootholme you may ancker at twenty fathom. South from Rootholme the Soltmer
river goes out, and reaches southeast into the Sea, there lies a high round
hill upon the land of Bommel called Syck, which shows like a hat, thereby you
know Bommel and Soltmer river, for it lies right between them both: when
this hill Syck lies northeast from you, then you are right before Bommelsond,
and north from Soltmer river it is high land, but the land on the south side of
Bommel is low land.

To sail from Rootholme to Crabbekerck, Crabberkerck.
first it is a league to sail through the narrow or strait northwest, and
from Rootholme to Crabbekerck it is north and by west three leagues: between
them both lies the Reyne Knape, The Reyne Knape.
which you may sail about on both sides. About south from Reyne Knape there
reach two rivers into the Sea, Papesond. Stormsond.
namely Papesond and Stormsond. Papesond rea^heth southsouthwest into the Sea.
But if you will sail out of Stormesond, then go along close by the land of
Rootholme fouth and by east, and leave all the broken Islands and rocks, with
the great Island on starborde, till you come into Soltmer river, there it goes
out into the Sea south and south and by west.

From the Narrow or Strait of Rootholme to Reyne Knape it is a league distant,
but from Reyne Knape to Crabbekerck it is north and by east more then a league.

Bock upon the Ra. Cruys riv^r. North Dro^mels.
From Crabbekerck to Bock upon the Ra, or Bockliet the course is northwest and
by north three leagues: between them the Cruys river runs into the Sea
southwest: Cruys river is a haven very well to be known, for against it there
lie three hills in the land, as if they were the Drommels of Norwaie, but they
are not so high, they are also called the north Dro^mels, when those three
hills are northeast, or thereabouts from you, then you are open before the
Cruys river.

By Bock upon the Ra you go through the narrow way, and right north from
Bock there lies a stone under the water, whereon always there stands a
beacon or a mast.

Watgestrome.
From Bock upon the Ra to the Watgestrome the course is north, and somewhat
westerlyer four leagues: in Watgestrome it is good anckor ground to lie there,
upon the south side at four-and-twentie fathom. In the Watgestrome the Liet
reaches northwest a league, S. Oelofs. holme.
to the Reesteen, against it S. Oelofs holme lies, by it you may go out of
the Ielte river, about behind Asland, about northwest into the Sea: when you
come out of the Sea to go into the Ielte river, then you are right against
Reesteene upon that Liet. Reesteene.
Reesteen lies on the east side of the Liet, right against the point whereon
the two high hills stand, L^torens.
which are called the Letoorens, they are two high sharp hillocks, which you
may see far off, when you sail up or down the Liet, in sailing up they lie
most northnorthwest, and north and by west from you.

Struys haven. Berghen. Harle.
Within Asland lies Struys haven, and from thence to the town of Berghen it is
northnortheast two leagues.

The Island of Harle is five leagues long, you may go about it on both sides,
when you come out of the north, and come so into the Waghe of Berghen in
Norwaie. The Harlefoert goes out about north and by west, Harleford.
and northnorthwest between Asland and the land of Harle.

III. Of the Tide or running of the Streams.
ON this coast of Norwaie from Neus to Berghen, and past Berghen as far as
Stadt the water rises and falls, but holds no certain tides. But northward
by Dronton the tide begins to hold, and to be ruled by the Moon.

IIII. How these Places are distant from each other.
FRom der Neus to the high land of Leest the course is northeast 3 leagues.
From der Neus to Fockstenes northwest about 7 leagues. From the uttermost rock
of Focksteenes to Ekesond north 4 leagues. From Focksteenes to the south point
of the Iedder northwest 7 leagues. From the south point of the Iedder to the
Vesteene northwest 5 leagues. From the Vesteen to Sibrighsteen northeast 4
leagues. From Vesteen to Schuytenes northnorthwest 5 leagues. From Schuytenes
to Sibrightsteene through within Whitingsey cast 5 leagues. From Schuytenes to
the Wtsiers w, and w. and by n. 4 leagues. From Schuytenes to Bommels hooft
northnorthwest, and somewhat northerlyer 7 leagues. From Bommels hooft to
Cruysfoert n. n. w. 9 leagues. From Cruysfoert to Harle northnorthwest 13
leagues. The stretching of all reaches in the Liet from Schuytenes to Berghen,
you find it in the Description of the Liet, from point to point perfectly set
down. From the Neus to the Wtsiers northwest 29 leagues. From the Wtsiers to
Ieltefoert or the Waghe of Berghen north and by west 26 leagues.
V. How these Lands are distant from other Lands.
IN the former Chapter I have showed how all the places and chiefest points of
all the north Seas, are distant in breadth and length from the Neus. From
Schuytenes to the Vlie south and by east, and somewhat southerlyer 106 leagues.
From Schuytenes to the Texel south, and south and by east 111 leagues. From
Schuytenes to Walcheren south 142 or 143 leagues. From Schuytenes to the Holmes
before Iarmouth south and by west and somewhat westerlyer 112 or 113 leagues.
From Schuytenes to Flamborowe head southwest and by south 105 or 106 leagues.
From Schuytenes to Tinmouth southwest 105 leagues. From Schuytenes to
Buquhamnesse west and by south, and somewhat southerlyer 72 leagues. From
Schuytenes to Hitland west and by north and westnorthwest 67 leagues. From
Schuytenes to the north end of Hitland westnorthwest and somewhat northerlyer
71 or 72 leagues. From the Wtsiers to the Vlie s. and by e. 103 or 104 leagues.
From the Wtsiers to the Wtweer rocks north and by west 40 leagues. From
Ielteforde or the Waghe of Berghen to Hitland west 48 leagues. From Ielteford
or the Waghe of Berghen to the north end of Hitland west and west and by north
51 leagues.
VI. Of the height of these Countries.
ACcording to the writing of Lucas Johnson Waghenaer these Lands lie under the
heigths hereafter set down. The Neus lies under 57 degrees 48 minutes. But my
opinion is that it is not so much northerly, for the reasons showed in the
Preface at the beginning of this Book. The Island of Schuytenes lies under 59
degrees. The Waghe of Berghen lies under 60 degrees. 15 or 20 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 32.

CHAPTER XIII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Norwaie, from Berghen or
Ielteford to the North Cape.
I. The situation between the Waghe of Berghen and the point of Stadt.
Harle.
THe Island of Harle is five leagues long: south from it Harleforde goes in,
sailing into it you come into the Waghe of Berghen. The same way also you go
into Ielteforde, but that reaches in west, or behind Asland, as it is showed
in the Chapter before. Also when you come out of the north, you may sail about
the Island of Harle, and so come also into the Waghe of Berghen.

From Ielteford or the Waghe of Berghen northnorthwest and north and by west
eleven or twelve leagues lie the rocks called Wtweere: Wtweere tockes.
they are out-rockes which reach somewhat into the Sea about three leagues.
There between them both it is all broken rockie land, which you may sail
through, for the Northern Iachts sail all through within the Kielstrome, and
come down from Kyne all within the rocks, behind the Island of Harle to
Berghen.

From Wtweer rocks to Old it is northnorthwest, and north and by west twelve
or thirteen leagues: between them both lies Zuydfort, Zuydvort.
which is a fair haven, there lie two Islands before, and you must run in
between them both.

Old.
Old is a high rock and lies alone, it shows like a saddle, and on both sides
goes round down: you may sail southward into Old, and come north out again,
and also north in and south out. Oldsond reaches in northeast. When Old is
east from you, then there is a haven, which is three leagues from the uttermost
rock, for there lie two rocks right west from Old, and two westnorthwest from
thence, those rocks you must leave on baghborde. When Old is southeast from
you there lie two or three rocks, which you must leave on starreborde, and go
in eastnortheast, then you find three or four Islands, which you must leave on
baghborde, and then go close along by the east end of the Island, and you
shall see Stadt lie without the land of Old.

The innermost land of Old is high land and hilly, as if it were houses: the
hackled land which stands inward is the land of Stadt.

About northwest and northwest and by north from Old there lie two smooth
rocks, some part above, and some part under the water.

North from Oldsond lies Kyne and Ornel, Kyn. Ornel.
which is like a saddle for a horse, and goes round down on both sides, you
may sail in southward to it, and come out again north, and so you do Kine
also.

From Old to Kyne it is four leagues, Stadt.
but Old and Stadt lie about eleven leagues distant. Between Kyne and Old
there goes a great River into the land, whereon there lie two towns, called
Waldres and Esterdal. Kyne is an Island and opens like the hoof of a cow, or
like a bishops Miter. Behind Kyne there is a fair haven.

Northwest and by west from Kyne there lie three or four rocks, some under the
water.

Southwest and by west also there lie rocks under and above the water, these
rocks lie at least three leagues from the land.

North from Kyne lie the out-rockes of Wtover, Wtover.
and there forward it is all sound land to Flowach.

North about the point of Stadt lies an Island or rock called Swinost, which
lies four leagues north from the point, Swinost.
about half way between Stadt and the Island of Geske.

Thus the land about Northford and Southford shows, when it lies east and by
south from you.
view of Norway

Thus the Fore-lands about Stadt show.

When the point of Stadt is northeast and by north from you, then the land of
Stadt, Kyne and Old shows thus.

This should have followed above, for it is the situation of the land about
Old.
view of 'Olde' (Norway)

II. How you shall sail from Stadt along the Liet of Roemsdale to Boede or the
Stopples.
ABout eight leagues north from Stadt lies the Island Flowach, Flowach.
and the Island Geske lies there northwards. The Island which some of our
Hollanders call Geske, the Bores or Husbandmen in Norwaie call Sandowe: Geske.
but behind it lies a little low long Island which they call Geske. From the
fore part of the Island Sandowe there shoots out a point of sand toward
Flowach: when you come out of the Sea you must turn about behind that point,
and there you may ancker at ten fathom fair ground against the Island Geske:
but you must not sail far beyond the foresaid point, for there lies a
blind rock somewhat inward close by Sandowe. Therefore you must ancker close
within the point: there stand little beacons or warders on the shore, that
thereby the Rode may be known.

Between Sandow and Flowach you must fail in eastward, and that is the
beginning of the Liet of Dronten. Right south from Flowach there lies an Island
called Harle or Hary, Harle or Hary.
you may also go in by it to the Liet of Dronten or Roemsdale, but southeast
from Flowach, there goes a great river up to Zuydmer or Nordmer.

The Island Sandowe has a strand round about it, Sandowe.
and there stands a church upon it, there you may go in about north and
south on both sides. And east from Geske there lie three or four great Islands,
which you may also run in between, and go to the Liet of Dronten.

The first great Island east from Geske is Luycko: north from it Luyckesond
goes in, Luycko. Luycsond.
it reaches about southeast and northwest. The Liet reaches from Luycko along
by the Island Lever to Beresond, most part northeast and by north and southwest
and by south, through between Roemsdale rocks, but without about it reaches
northeast and by east and southwest and by west.

If you will go into Roemsdale, you may go in east or north by Gounske or
Gomsky, Roemsdale. Gounske. Samso.
it reaches in east and east and by south. North from Samso, that is between
Samso and Gounske, there runs in a haven east and by south, you may go into
all these havens or channels if you will go into Roemsdale, to the Liet: and
when you are in Liet, The Island Lever.
there lies the aforesaid Island called Lever, which you may sail round about.
The haven of Roemsdale reaches in from the Liet southeast and northwest. From
the Island of Lever to Boede the Liet reaches northeast.

Boede is an out-point, Boede.
which is fast to the firm land by a neck or small piece of land, there dwell
many fishermen, and there is a great fishing. Against Boede lie the Stopples,
and there between them both it is about half a league wide, Stopples.
when you go through between them, then you run along by Boede. Beresond.
Beresond lies about three leagues west from Stopples. All these Islands
between Boede and Flowach are under Zuydmer Leen.

Thus the Island of Stadt, and thus the point of Stadt shows, when it lies
southsoutheast from you eight leagues.
view of 'Stadt' (Norway)

When Geske lies about four leagues east from you then the land between Geske
and Stadt shows thus, and then Stadt lies southsoutheast from you.
view of Giske

This belongs to the former, for it is the land to the point of Stadt.

Thus the Island Sandowe shows, when it is east from you.
view of 'Sandowe' (Norway)

Thus the Island Luycko shows when it is east and by north from you.
view of 'Luycko' (Norway)

III. How you shall sail from Boede along the Liet to Dronten.
FRom Boede to Witholme the course is northeast five leagues: Witholme.
Stemmesnes.
between them both lies Stemmesnes or Heynst, and there against it to Seaward
lie four or five Holmes or rocks, you may run in betwixt them, close along
by the point of Stemmesnes.

About half a league southsoutheast from Witholme lies the point of
Smeerholme, and between them both the Liet of Dronten goes in east, and east
and by north, till you come before Normer, which as you sail up lies on the
left hand, Smeerholme. Normer.
and the Islands of Avero lie on the right hand. From Normer the Liet reaches
to the church of Ief baye, along by the East Poster northeast sixteen leagues.
From thence the Liet reaches upwards to Dronten before the town eastsoutheast
and east and by south: between them both there lies a point called Dreckort
or Drontenort. Drontenort.


Oster Poster. Hamersond. Iorianwagh.
The East Poster is a high land, which in sailing up you leave on starborde.
North from the East Poster there lies a haven called Hamersond, there are
many good Deals. Right south from Hamersond lies Iorianwagh, which is a
fair river, and there also they saw fair Deals. There lie three Holmes or
Islands before the haven, but there you may sail through in all places without
fear.

Iuret.
South from Iorianwagh there lie two great creekes or rivers, called Iuret,
where you may also fetch great mastes and deals: there lie two Islands before
them, and you may run through between them both. Averosond.
Or if you will go into Averosond, coming from the East Poster, then you may
go north about them: there the land reaches northeast and southwest.

Anwick. Torwick.
Right south from the creek of Ioret there lies a great broad river called
Anwick, there are two or three Sawes to saw Deals, as Anwick and Torwick,
which rivers or Currants are the places whereon the sawes are placed, these
reach in most southeast, and on the north side of the haven there stands a
church.

The Island of Grip lies about four leagues without the land: Grip Island
between Witholme and Grip the Gripsond reaches in eastnortheast, you may go
through within the fishermens Weert, Gripsond.
and then you may see the high land of East Poster lie before you, you go in
upon it till you be in the Liet of Dronten, and from Grip to East Poster it
reaches most eastnortheast, then you come between two lands, and from that
place it is Pilots water to bring you up to Dronten, then forward it reaches
to Dronten first northeast, and then eastsoutheast to the town, as I said
before.

South from Grip there are diverse channels, by the which you come up to the
Liet, as also north from Grip: but southward are the best, for northward it is
dangerous to come into the land.

Thus the land between Grip and Geske shows, when the north point lies east
and by south seven leagues from you.
view of Norway

This belongs to that before, and is to be joined by the Crosses, being the
rest of the land that follows along to Geske.

IIII. The situation between Dronten or the Island of Grip and the North Cape
or point.
FRom the Island Grip to Nomendaelfch Islands Nomendael^^h Islands.
the course is northeast nineteen leagues: but from Grip to the Island Rust,
Rust.
the course is north and north and by east four-and-sixtie leagues: between
them both (besides Nomendaelfch Islands) there lie the Islands of Heyligheland,
Hol^ land.
and Tranooch. Tr^^^och.
Rust and Tranooch are distant thirteen leagues. From Rust to Loffort Lo^^ rt.
it is northnortheast three-and-thirtie leagues. But from Rust to Wero Were
it is northeast and by north nine leagues. Between them both lies
Maelstrome, which you can not go through when the tide runs, but at still
water you may well go through it. Loffort lies north from Wero, there you may
also go through between them, and ancker under the west end of Loffort. You
may sail through from Loffort between the Islands and the firm land along to
the North Cape.

Between Westerhol, Westerhol.
Sanien, Sanien.
Tromsondt Tromsond
and Ingen, Ingen.
you may go in also and seek Rode, but without you may not come to near
those Islands, for in some places there lie rocks reaching out from them more
then a league into the Sea, you may also go through between Surroy and Loppen
or the North Cape, and come out again in Keelwick. Under the Island it is a
very good Rode, before the Fishermens village. Keelwick Keelwick.
is a place lying in the Creek between the North Cape and the North Kyne.

About seven-and-thirtie leagues west from the North cape reaches the Coast
along the Islands west and west and by south.

Thus the east end of Westerhol shows, when you sail by it, and are about
seven leagues from it
view of 'Westerhol' (island in Norway) Thus the Island of Sanien shows, when

V. Of the tides and running of the streams in these places.
Between Stadt and Berghen the water ebbes and flows, but holds no certain
tide.

Between Stadt, Luycksond and Boede a southsouthwest moon makes full Sea.

Within Aveiro, in Anwick, and before Dronten a south and north moon makes
full Sea, and the same Tide runs to Boede.

On the North Cape a southsouthwest and northnortheast moon makes high water.

West from the North Cape the streams come out of the northwest, and
westnorthwest, and so fall along by Finmarke to the North cape.

VI. How these Countries are distant from each other.
FRom Ielteford or the Waghe of Berghen to the rocks of Wtweer n. n. w. and n.

it lies the Island Stappen, and from Stappen to the North Cape it is east 6 or
7 leagues. From the North Cape to the North Kyne it is east and by south 13
leagues.
VII. How these Places are distant from other Countries.
FRom Stadt to the north end of Hitland the course is west southwest 69
leagues. From Stadt to the east point of Island westnorthwest 200 leagues. From
Stadt to the right Greenland about n. w. 333 leagues. Men were wont to go
thither eastward about Island, but that way is altogether spoiled and utterly
decayed, but now within these few years the King of Denmark has given
commandment to his Subjects to sail to Greenland, and to discover the same.
From Grip to the north end of Hitland southwest and by west 125 leagues. From
Grip to the south end of Fero w. s. w. 167 leagues. From Grip to the east

30 minutes. Stadt lies under 62 degrees The Island Geske lies under 62 degrees
30 minutes. Luyckesond lies under 62 degrees 40 minutes. The Stopples and
Boede lie under 63 degrees 28 minutes. The Islands Avero, Smeerholme and
Witholme lie under 63 degrees 44 minutes. The Island Grip lies under 64
degrees. The town of Dronten lies under 64 degrees 30 minutes. Maelstrome
lies under 68 degrees. The Island Sanien lies under 70 degrees. The North Cape
lies under 71 degrees 30 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 34.
CHAPTER XIIII. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Lapland, from the North
Cape to the Mouth of the White Sea.
I. The situation between the North Cape and Kilduyn.
FRom the North Cape to the North Kyne North Kyne.
the course is east and by south thirteen leagues: and from the North Kyne to
Tannebay or Matcorf the course is eastsoutheast eleven or twelve leagues.

Tannebay Tannebay
is a great broad River, which within devideth it self in two parts, and in
some Creekes there stand some fishermens houses.

From Matcorf or the point of Tannebaye to Warhouse the course is southeast and
somewhat southerlyer fourteen or sixteen leagues. Between them both there
lies much flat high land, about half way between them both (but nearest to
Warhouse) upon the high land there lies a high hillock, like to a land house,
or a little castle, which is very well to be known: when you are by it close
by the land, it shows as if that against it there were a great river which
you might sail into.

If you will sail into Warhouse Warhouse.
coming southward you may sail in without doubt between the Island and the
firm land, for there it is deep enough in every place, there you may ancker
about the middle way from the Island, at ten or twelve fathom before a
Sandbaye, against the castle, there it is good ancker ground.

But if you will go out again at the north chanel, then sail nearer to the
rock whereon the gallows stand then to the Island, for there against it it is
somewhat foul on the Island of Warhouse, and the chanel reaches out most part
northward. The Island of Warhouse is about half a league long, and there lie
also two small Islands more close by to seaward.

From Warhouse to the point of Kegro, Fishers Island or Kogor.
or the fishermens Island it is eastsoutheast, and southeast and by south eleven
or twelve leagues. When you are against the point of Kegro, then you may see
the land of Warhouse from below. You may ancker under the point of Kegro, but
it is no fair rode for great ships, for there it is not deep. Between
Warhouse and Kegro there is a great Creek, therein lies the river of
Pitsingh, Pitsingh.
where there is fishing for salmons. Southsouthwest from the point of Kegro or
Oosterhaven there lie two Islands, there southward you may go into Monick
river. Monickfoert.


From the point of Kegro or Kegor to Laus Laus.
the course is along by the land southeast and southeast and by south about
nine leagues, it is a fair sandbaye: behind the point, and a little more
toward Kegro there is a point like an Island, and upon the point of Laus there
stand two great beacons or mastes.

From Laus to the river of Cola the course is south and by east, and
southsoutheast about eleven leagues. Cola and Kilduyn.
But Kilduyn and Laus lie distant southeast and somewhat southerlyer and
northwest and somewhat northerlyer.

Thus Matcorf shows when it is cross from you three leagues.

Thus North Kyne shows when you sail by it.

II. How you may sail up into the River of Cola, and the situation of Kilduyn.
TO sail up the River of Cola, then go from Laus or the south end of the
fishermens Islands to the River southsoutheast and south and by east, and go
about by the high land of Podenvolke, then the river will show very wide open
unto you. When you are by the point of Laus, then you may easily see the Island
of Kilduyn and the River of Kola, or the land by it, and between Laus and the
River of Cola there is also a great Creek, and when you are within the mouth
of the River, first it reaches in south and by west, and then southsouthwest
to the Island, which in the Card of this River is marked with the Letter A, and
then sometimes southwest and by south by the Island marked with the letter B to
the Trane Island, then southwest and by west, and sometimes about the point west
and by south, and then in west to Divles point, there over against it lies the
white stone, which lies on the land, and against it is good Rode: from thence
again west and by south, westsouthwest, southwest, and southsouthwest most
part to Cola.

When you are up within the River, Rode in the river:
and will ancker there, then keep along by the west side, and when you are a
little within there you shall see a little small Island, lying close by the land,
from thence a little further forward about the high point there is a bought or
Creek, and in it there is a Sandbay, where you may lay a ship safe without
ancker or cable, it is a fair Sandbaye where you go full in, along by the
north side it is five fathom, and fair sandy ground, and there you go in
between the two points: but there lies a black rock in the narrow way
between both the sides of the land, which you must leave on starborde, and
within that rock it is dry and two fathom deep, till you be against the
strand, there within it is fair green fields. Right without the baye there
lie two Islands, whereof the uttermost or the easterlyest is the smallest, where
in sailing up

Here follows the Card N. 35.

the River by these two Islands, you come in the middle way between the Island
marked A, there also is good rode on the west side, there upon the high ground
you shall see three beacons or mastes, called the three Kings, against them
there is a rode, and when you are a little past the Island marked with A, then
you can see the river no more open, but it seems to be close and shut up,
for then the Island marked with A comes under the high land on the east side.

Under the Island marked with B there is also good Rode and fair sandy ground,
it is also good Rode under the Traen Island, Trane Island.
and that is reckoned for half of the River, to wete, from the Mouth to Cola.

When you are a little past the Traen Island, where the letter C stands, then
before you see a black bluish hill, called the Devils hill, Devils hill.
and it seems from thence forth, as if the River were close and shut up: on
the starborde side it is best sailing along for there you have good ground most
part along close by the land, there are many bougths, hooks, and Creekes,
which can not all be described: on the other side men use not so commonly to
go, unless it be by default, and there are as it seems many bays and
rivers, and also some by-rivers. Now when you are past the Devils hill, where
the letter D stands, past the white stone, then you may see Clinck hill
Clinckhil.
on the west side, and almost along to Cola. When you may see Clinck hill,
there is ground all along by the west side to ancker, and then it is not foul
on neither side: but when you come in so far to the place which is marked
with the letter E, there you must somewhat shun the west side, because of a
foul place, which there shoots off from the land, and keep in the middle of
the water till you be against Clinckhill, there you must go close to the land
again, for in the middle of the river there lies an Island of rocks, which at
high water are covered, you must look well unto it: from Clinckhill to Robben
Island Robben Island.
sail all along by the west side: Robben Island also is covered at high water,
and when it is covered then ancker under the dried trees. Against Robben Island
there lies a very great stone at the foot of the hill, look well unto it
there, and go without it or north from it, at least a bow shot, there is
the Rode, and there you may ancker by the land as dry as you will, there it is
good lying, and there you begin to see Cola by the house.

If you will seek for rode under Kilduyn, Kilduyn.
when you come out of the north or the west, then go to the west end of
Kilduyn, through between the mayeland and Kilduyn, and when you have sailed a
little within, then you shall see a round Island, and there it begins to be
narrow, but you may well laveere through it, then go forth to the southeast
end, and there ancker in the bought under Kilduyn, as near to the land as you
will, there stand a company of Lapland houses, and there is the principal
rode, there you are safe against all winds: the point south from the rode is
low land. You may also ancker under the firm land, between the narrow way
and the rode of Kilduyn, at a place where in the Card an anchor is marked.
Through between Kilduyn and the land it reaches westnorthwest and
eastsoutheast.

To sail from the east into Kilduyn then go in west, till you come by the
aforesaid low point of the Island, then turn up northward along about the
point, and ancker in the bocht aforesaid before the houses upon the Rode, at
twelve thirteen or fourteen fathom, on the south side it is very deep,
fifty or sixty fathom.

There lie also some other Islands east from Kilduyn, where possible you should
find Rode under them, but I can write no certainty thereof.

Thus the Island of Kilduyn shows it self when you come out of the west.
view of Kildin (island in Russia) Thus Kilduyn shows when the shoring point
is south and by east, and the river of Cola southsouthwest from you about five
leagues, the land west from Kilduyn is very hilly, and the river opens
very wide as it stands here.

III. The situation of the Seven Islands, Swetenose and Lombasco, and so forth
to Orloghones.
FRom Kilduyn to the Seven Islands Seven Islands.
the course is southeast nineteen leagues: under the Islands you may anchor
where you will: you may go in by the westerlyest Island, and there ancker at
five or six fathom.

From the Seven Islands to Swetenose the course is southeast one-and-twentie
leagues. About three leagues west from Swetenose Islands west from Swetenoes
there lie certain Islands, where you may ancker behind them, the northerlyest
lies right west from the point of Swetenose, you may the^e go in by it and
ancker behind it, when you are by Swetenose, then you see little of those
Islands, because the firm land is much higher then those Islands. To sail into
Iokena or the river of Swetenose when you come north or west, then you must
sail close by the land, to have a sight of the Island, and go through between
the Mayeland and the Island, but the best chanel to go into it is through
between the third and the fourth Island, which is a deep wide and broad
chanel, and lies southwest, and southwest and by west from the point of
Swetenose, you run most south into the River, and then you see the Island,
which lies within the other Islands, you may ancker there behind. When you are
a little past the innermost Island, and come against the high point, then you
sail in in the middle of the water between both the lands, and there it is
shallowe water at five, four, three and two and an half fathom, as it stands
marked in the Card, but you may go boldly in through the middle of the
chanel, along to the Lapland houses, where the salmon fishing is, and ancker
there in the midst of the water, but you must there look well about you, for
there abouts there lie some blind rocks, Blind Rocks.
which are bare at low water.

To find the right situation of this haven, then mark, that when the high
point is behind the fourth Island, about south from you, and the point of
Swetenose northeast and northeast and by east, then you are right open before
or against the said haven. Some say that you may sail through behind,
between the fourth Island and the point, but there between them both it is
very narrow. The Tide there falls just with the Tide at Swetenoes, not much
differing, and with a Spring-tyde ebbeth and flows two fathom and an half.

Behind the point of Swetenoes Swetenoes.
you may run into the Creek and there ancker safely against a north,
northeast, and east winds, there it is fair ground.

From Swetenose to Lombasco Lombasco
the course is southsoutheast about thirteen leagues, you may also ancker
under Lombasco, but there it is not so good lying, specially with great
ships, and also there it is not very fair, it beats there very strongly
in, when the wind blows out of the Sea. You may see the situation of this
rode in the Card, and there the depth is perfectly marked, both at high and
low water. The water ebbes and flows there at least two fathom, and at a
Spring-tyde little less then three, or two fathom and an half. Within the
point or the bought you can not lie, for there it is not above three foot
water, and there also it is very stony and foul.

From Lombasco to Orlogones Orloghones.
the course is southsoutheast and south and by east six or seven leagues. But
from Orlogones to the three Islands it is southsoutheast about twelve leagues.

When you are about half way between the North Cape and North Kyne, and about
seven leagues without the land, you go with a course of southeast and by south
without all land, but if you set your course something more southerlyer then
you fall on Swetenoes.

Thus the land shows between Swetenose and Orloghones, when you sail along
by it.

Under this Island you may hide a ship from yseganges, and it lies half a
league beyond the Skonce.

These graie points are between Swetenoes and Lombasco.

IIII. Of the Tide and running of the streams.
AT the North Cape a southsouthwest moon makes a high water.

Against Tannebaye a southwest moon makes high water.

At Warhouse a southwest and northeast moon makes high water.

At Kilduyn an eastsoutheast moon makes high water.

At the Seven Islands a southeast moon makes high water.

At Swetenose a south and north moon makes high water.

Along by these Coasts cast from the North Cape the streams come out of the
northwest and northnorthwest, and go so along the coast of Lapland to
Orloghonoes.

V. How these Lands are distant from each other and from other Lands.
FRom North-kyne to Tannebaye or Matcorf the course is southeast 11 or 12
leagues. From Matcorf or the point of Tannebaye to Warhouse southeast and
somewhat southerlyer 14 or 16 leagues. From Warhouse to the point of Kegor or
Osterhaven southeast and southeast and by south 11 or 12 leagues. From the
point of Kegro to Laus southeast and southeast and by south about 9 leagues.
From Laus to the River of Cola south and by east and southsoutheast about 11
leagues. From Kilduyn to the Seven Islands southeast 19 leagues. From the Seven
Islands to Swetenose southeast 21 leagues. From Swetenose to Lambasco
southsoutheast 13 leagues. From Lambasco to Orlogenes southsoutheast and south
and by east about 6 or 7 leagues. From Orlogenes to Cape de Candenoes northeast
47 leagues. From Kilduyn to Costintsarke upon Nova Zembla east and by north 118
leagues.
VI. Of the height of these Countries.
THe Island of Kilduyn lies under 69 degrees 34 minutes. Cape de Candenose
lies under 68 degrees 46 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 36.
CHAPTER XV. A DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of Russia, Corellen and Lapland:
and also the Coast of Russia, between Cape de Candenose and Nova Zembla, or
the Strait of Waigats.
I. The situation between Orloghones and the River of Archangel.
FRom Orloghones to the three Islands Three Islands.
(as I have also showed in the Chapter before) the course is southsoutheast
five leagues: from thence three leagues distant southsouthwest, lies the river
of Ponoy. Ponoy.


The Mouth of the White Sea is but eleven leagues broad: about four leagues
from the three Islands, in the middle of the Mouth of the White Sea there lies
a Sand, A Sand in the Mouth of the white Sea.
which in some places at a low water is bare, you must sail westward about
it, and you may also go eastward about it, but there it is flat water and
very shallowe.

From the three Islands to the Island Sousnowits, which is commonly called the
Cross Island, Cross Island.
the course is southsouthwest thirteen leagues, but from Ponoy it is eleven
leagues. Sousnowits.
Southeast and by south from the three Islands on the Russia side the Mesensche

goes in, whereinto there runs a great river to Colmogro, and there goes
another river into the land, whereon the town of Slowodo Slowodo.
lies.

From the Cross Island or Sousnowits to the Cats or Catsnose point, which is
also called the Blue or Graie point, Catsnoes or Graie point.
the course is southwest and by south twenty or one-and-twentie leagues, upon
the south side of the chanel there lies a banck, Banck.
which is no deeper then three fathom, it is at least seven or eight leagues
long, and reaches southwest and by west and northeast and by east.

From Catsnose point to the Mouth of the river of Archangel the course is south
and by west seventeene leagues.

Thus the Island of Orloghones shows southward from the three Islands, Ponoy,
and the Cross Island,

II. How you shall sail into, and up the River of Archangel.
When you go south and by west from Blue point to S. Nicolas you see the land
a great way west from S. Nicolas, which shows like a long piece of land, and
a little nearer to the River you see more land, which opens it self as if it
were a round Island, and after that you may see the steeple of S. Nicolas, S.
Nicolas.
and when the steeple of S. Nicolas stands south and south and by west from
you then you are open before the Mouth of the River of Archangel. Marks of the
haven.
If you will go into the River, then sail upon the steeple of S. Nicolas
until you see the Cape which stands upon the west side, place that a lever
or bow length west from S. Nicolas steeple, then there come two small downs
under the said steeple, those two small downs lie right west from the cross
down, and there lies also another down westward, which also is greater, for
those downs are very small, then the steeple stands also in a valleye of
the wood, which are all marks of this haven. Having brought the Cape so as I
said, then sail in upon it south and south and by west, and sometimes somewhat
easterlyer. You may also place the Cape and the steeple right against each
other, and go in upon them, Depth in the chanel.
then you go in along by the west side, which far off from the land is
altogether flat. Without before the haven it is five, four, and three fathom
deep: but in the mouth or upon the Drumple of the haven it is no deeper at
high water then fiveteene or sixteen foot, and at low water twelve or
thirteen foot. But when you can not see the Cape, or that it is gone, then you
may bring the town of S. Nicolas into the wood, in such manner, as that almost
the third part of the wood be westward, and almost the other two third parts
of the wood stand eastward of it. When you have gotten to the mouth of the
River, you must sometimes go easterlyer, as, south and south and by east, till
you come to the west side, then go close along by it, and put not off from it,
until you come against the white pleck or place on the west side, to the
place, the which is marked in the Card with the letter A. Then strike over
from it east and by south, and eastsoutheast right to the point of the wood on
the east side, and so southeast along by the east side, close by the land: but
against the two Islands which lie on starborde, it is very foul and shallowe
along by the east side, which you must look to: but go along by the east side,
until you come to the first river on baghborde, then strike over again to the
west side southsouthwest to the bought, there on the east side it is flat
water: and when you are in the bought, then go on eastsoutheast, and then east
and by south to the Stone-reach, Stone-reach.
there sail in the middle of the river, along by the tonnes, for they lie in
the middle of the chanel, and on both the sides of the tonnes it is uneven and
rugged ground. When you come against the Stone-reach there stands a fishers
house upon the west side, by the little river that runs into the land, on the
north end or west end of the Stone reach: against that foresaid house there
lies a great stone under the water, about which you may sail on both sides,
it lies about the middle in the chanel, as you sail forward, but Mariners are
accustomed to sail westward about, along by the west side, as also through the
Stone-reach, for the west side is deep enough, and in some places soft
yielding ground, but the east side is full of stones. When you are past the
tonnes, then you must again keep some thing off from the shore. There was
wont to lie an Island at the end of the Stone reach, but not long since it is
wholly cut and broken away by the ice. When you are through the Stone-reach,
then the course is first southeast, and then southeast and by south into the
bought, then go eastsoutheast, and keep along by the west side, till you see
the town of Archangel, Archangel
then sail right to it, but shun the point on baghborde for that is foul.

To sail further up the river, from Archangel to Colmogro it is about twelve
or thirteen leagues, To sail to Colmogro.
most southeast crooking about, according to the stretching of the crookings of
the River.

From the haven of Podessemsche, or from the River of Archangel to the Rode of
S. Nicholas it is four leagues: there stands a beacon upon the end of the
Island, whereon the English house stands, and west from that beacon is the
Rode for the English ships at six or seven fathom, as you lie near or
far from the land. The English river English River.
reaches in eastnortheast and northeast and by east, along by the closter of
S. Nicolas, but it is a dry River, so that no ships may go into it, but you
must lade your ships with lighters or boats.

About southwest and southwest and by west from the mouth of the River of
Archangel there lies a Salt-Iland, Salt Island.
whereon there stands a closter, it is fast to the firm land. From thence to
Cape de Onega Cape de Onega.
the land reaches west and by north.

III. The situation of the Coast of Russia between Cape de Candenoes and Nova
Zembla.
CApe de Candenoes Cape de Candenoes.
and Orloghones lie distant northeast and southwest seven-and-fortie leagues:
this point of Candenoes is a place well to be known, upon it there stand five
Crosses for marks: and when you fall upon it, you may perfectly perceive, that
the land falls on the one side southwest to the white Sea, and southeast to
the other side.

About thirteen leagues east from Cape de Candenoes there lies an Island
called Morsonowits, Morsonowits.
and east there goes a great creek into the land, but it is very flat
water, with many shallowes and dwalegrounds: Eere now it hapened that some
ships sailed into this place, thinking that they sailed into the mouth of the
white Sea, and knew not where they were, for it is almost one height and
stretching with the white Sea, but it is easily to be known and discerned by
the land, for the Coast of Russia east from Candenoes is altogether downie
lands, and flat strand, but the Coast of Lapland is high and hilly. Within
this River there runs up a River through the land, which you may go through
with Lodges into the White Sea.

Against this creek, about six-and-twentie leagues east, and east and by south
from Candenoes lies the Island of Colgoia, Colgoia.
which is thirteen leagues long, you may sail round about it, but on the
south side there goes a great Sand or shelf along by the land: when you come
out of the east you must shun it, for it is fast to the west end of the
Island. Upon this Island there are a great number of Geese, which in Somer are
all clean naked, without any feathers, they sit and hatch upon one egg,
which lies under them, and so breed their young ones, and are so great a
number there, that the Russians go there on land with their Lodges, and lay a
deal or board upon the land, and drive the geese with staves in so great
number into their Iachts and Lodges, that they salt great number of them in
barrels.

From Candenoes to the Island Tussara Tussara.
it is eastsoutheast three-and-fortie leagues: Between them both the Creek
aforesaid goes in. West from Tussara lies the point of Swelgenoes. Swelgenoes.


From Tussara to the River of Colcova Colcova.
the course is east seve^ leagues: it is a good River, being twelve foot deep,
but there is no other trade there, but that the Russians come thither from
Colmogro and S. Nicolas with Lodges to traffic there, and to barter their
wares for skins and other wares.

Seven leagues east from the River of Colcova lies the river of Pitsana,
Pitsana.
in it there is but six foot water, and it is an unknown place, but right
west from it there lies a Sand, which you must shun, for Oliver Brunel in
his voyage to Nova Zembla fell on ground upon it.

About thirteen leagues east from Pitsana lies the River of Pitsora, Pitsora.
which reaches in by the east point southsoutheast, it is twelve foot deep:
there the land is low and downie, and on the west side there stands a
Packhouse, with some Crosses: when you are within the River, then you turn up
westward to the Packhouse, and there you must ancker at three and four fathom,
for there is a great Haf or Inland-water: you must shu^ne the east side of the
River, for it is full of Sands and Banks. The town of Pitsora lies about
six-and-twentie dutch miles into the Land, and there is great abundance of
Skins and Cristal.

Between Pitsora and Waygates lies Oltgin, Oltgin.
and without upon the land there lie two rocks or ^ands, the one called
Orangien, ^ra^g^a.
the other Grave Maurits, Gra^l Mourits.
there you may ancker under them at six or seven fathom: from the
southerlyest there comes a Sand shooting off, but you may well sound it at
three fathom. East and west from these two Islands there is a great Creek, it
is flat water, and there the land runs round about to the point of
Pitsora, altogether in one Creek from Pitsora to Waygates: and it is from
Pitsora to Waygates northeast and northeast and by east two-and-thirtie leagues.

IIII. The situation of Waygates and Nova Zembla.
VVaygates Waygates.
(which also is called the Strait of Nossowe) is a Strait which you may sail
through into the Tartarian Sea, which first reaches about east, and then
northeast till you be through it, about eight or nine leagues, and about the
middle thereof there lies an Island, which you may sail about on both sides. A
little within the point, on the north side there lies a fair Baye, Tra^nb^y.
which you may sail into as deep as you will at five, four and three fathom
good ancker groun^, along by the east side it is deep water, and there you lie
^a^e from all kind of winds and currants of ice. This Strait or narrow
passage has been twice sought to find a way to go north about Tartaria to
the rich Kingdoms of China and Cathaya, and so to the Molucques, but it was
all in vain, because of the great ice, which all the year long stays there,
and can never melt, by means of the continual cold.

From the east end of the Strait of Waygates to the Creek of Oby Oby.
it is eastsoutheast, and southeast and by east forty leagues. There eastward
the land reaches forth northeast forty leagues more, to the two northerly
rivers, and then reaches also northeast forward, but how far it is yet
unknown. The west coast of Nova Zembla reaches from Waygates or northwards to
Costinsarck about northnorthwest three-and fifty leagues, and there about the
north, it is about north and by east to the point of Longhenes, or the States
point, and then northnortheast, northeast, and eastnortheast to the Islands of
Orange, the northerlyest part of Nova Zembla, which lies under
seven-and-seventie degrees and an half.

V. What Moon makes high water here, and how the streams rise and fall.
AT the three Islands it is high water with a southwest and northeast moon.

At Catsnose point an east and west moon makes high water.

Before Podessemsche and S. Nicolas an east and by south and w^st and by north
moon makes high water.

At the Island of Nova Zembla a southeast moon makes high water.

From Orloghones and the three Islands the stream falls into the mouth of the
White Sea, to the Graie point of Catsnose, about southsouthwest and southwest
and by west.

But about the point of Catsnose the stream falls into the White Sea, part
to Warsiga and Ombay, and also to Podessemsche and S. Nicolas south, and south
and by west, and so falls out and into the River of Archangel.

East from Candenoes to the Island of Colgoya the stream falls east and east
and by south, as also along by the same Island, and from Colgoya to Waygates the
stream falls east and west.

Along by Nova Zembla the streams follow the moon, and along by Russia they
come between Candenoes and Pitsora out of the west and westnorthwest, and so
fall along by Russia.

The streams to Waygates come from Colgoya and Nova Zembla, and fall with the
others east and by north, through the Strait of Waygates, to the river of Oby,
so that the ebbes and the floods keep the channels of Waygates open, whereby
many times they are without ice, or at least but with such ice as drives in
sholes or great stakes.

But east from Waygates the floods come out of the northeast and so fall into
Oby, and into the Strait of Nassowe, the water there rises and falls, but it
holds no certain tides.

VI. Of the depths and grounds, as well east as west from Waygates.
ALl the whole Coast along from Candenoes to Waygates you find a flat rising
ground, most part sand and soft or steek-ground. When you sail in mistie
wether, you must understand that you are at eight or nine fathom depth four or
five leagues from the Coast, but when you are at thirty, five-and-thirtie or
forty fathom, then you are far enough from the land, so it is also along by
Nova Zembla, as also before the east side of Waygates, but when you come before
the chanel it is shallower.

VII. How these Lands are distant from each other.
FRom Orloghenoes to the three Islands s. s. c. 5 leagues. From the three Islands
to the Island with the cross, called Sousnowits southsouthwest 13 leagues. From
the Cross Island to Catsnoes, or the Graie point south and by west 17 leagues.

VIII. Some long and cross courses from the White Sea, and also from Russia
between C. de Candenoes and Nova Zembla.
FRom Catsnoes or the Graie point to the Islands of Solofky west and somewhat
southerlyer 37 leagues. From Catsnoes to Warsiga northwest and somewhat
westerlyer 29 or 30 leagues. From Catsnoes to Polongi northwest and by north 23
leagues. From the Island of Solofky to Ombay in Lapland the course is north 32

leagues. From the east end of Colgoya to Waygates east 60 leagues. From
Pitsora to the east end of Colgoya w. n. w. 43 leagues.
IX. Under what degrees these Countries lie, as writings do witness.
THe point of Catsnoes or the Graie point lies under 65 degrees. S. Nicolas or
the River of Archangel lies under 64 degrees 30 minutes. The Islands of Solofky
lie under 65 degrees. Ombay lies under 66 degrees 45 min^ Cape de Candenoes
lies under 69 degrees 30 min^ The Island of Colgoya lies under 69 degrees 10
minu The Rivers of Colcova, Pitsana, and Pitsora lie under 68 degrees 30 minu
Waygates or the Strait of Nassowe lies under 69 deg^ 40 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 37.
CHAPTER XVI. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Islands of Fero or Far: also of Hitland,
Fulo, and Fayrhil.
I. The situation of the Islands of Fero.
The names of the Islands of Fero.
TThe greatest and chiefest Islands of Fero are twelve in number: as Suydro,
Sando, Mogghenes, Waghe, Stromo, Ostro, Calso, Cuno, Bordo, Wydro, Swyno and
Fulo: the small Islands of Fero are ten, as Littledymen, Stoerdymen, Schuyvo,
Dalsfles, Hesten, Trollo, Closter, Mogghenesholme, Monick, and the Bishop.
Besides these there are some rocks and small Islands six or seven in number.

The southerlyest great Island called Suydro, Suydro.
it reaches most southeast and northwest about seven or eight leagues. On the
southeast end of this Island there lies a high rock called the Monick Monick.
or Somby, Somby.
after the name of the first or southerlyest haven in Suydro. Between the
Monick and the southeast end of Zuydro there is a Ras or Well, which you must
shun, specially at a Spring tide.

Upon the west side of this Island of Suydro there are no havens for ships to
lie at Rode in, for it is altogether high shoring land, but on the north side
there are many havens, whereinto you may sail and lay ships at ancker, as
Somsond or Hest, Hofwick, Vroby, Quaelby or Rane, which are all wide rivers or
havens. A husbandman or Pilot will bring you into them all, whenever you will
or need.

From the northwest end of Suydro to Mogghenesholme, Mogghenesholme.
the westerlyest or uttermost Island of Fero, the course is northwest and by
north and northnorthwest about eight or nine leagues.

At the east end of Mogghenesholme lies Mogghenes, and east from it lies the
Island Wage. Wage.
East from Wage there runs a fair river out of the southeast, from the
Island Sando, about Hesten and the Island Kolster: for you may go about on both
sides of these Islands, and leave the great Island Stromo on the east side, and
so come into Waghe. In the middle of the river or haven of Waghe, there goes a
fair haven eastward, up into the great Island of Stromo, therein you may ancker
at te^ne or twelve fathom, but the haven is at least twenty fathom deep.

Mogghenes and the northeast end of Fero lie distant eastnortheast, or a little
northerlyer, and westsouthwest about sixteen leagues. Between them both there
lie ten Islands, and between each Island there is a fair deep chanel or
river, whereof the fourth from Mogghenes is called Somsond: Somsond.
all these channels reach most northnorthwest and southsoutheast through the
land, and upon all those Islands there stand churches, except it be Ostra, which
never the less is a great Island.

From the southeast end of Suydro to Schalhooft, or the southeast end of the
Island Sando, the course is north and by west about five leagues. Between
Suydro and Sando there lie the Islands of Luttledymen, Stoerdymen, Schavo and
Dalsfles.

From Schalhooft till you be within the Island Mulso, lying before Stromo, the
course is north and by west four leagues, there you may ancker in every place
when you will, at twenty, thirty or forty fathom. If you come out of the
Sea, and desire to find a good rode under the Islands of Fero, you must hold
the middlemost great Island (named Stromo) northwest and northwest and by west
from you, then in the middle of the Island Stromo you shall see a high steep
hill called Schellinck, Schellinck
which you must sail up unto, then you shall come to the Island Mulso
aforesaid, which is a low Island, which you may go about on both sides, but it
is best to go into it on the south end: and under this Island it is all over
good ancker ground. Right over against this Island, on the great Island lies
Torshaven, Torshaven.
the principal haven of Fero, where all their trade of merchandise is used.

From Torshaven or the Island Mulso to the northeast end of Fero the course is
northeast and northeast and by east, about Eijgentlijcke afbeeldinghe vande

map of the Faroe Islands twelve or thirteen leagues. Between them both there
lie seven Islands, and between each Island (as I said before) there goes a wide
chanel through the land, reaching about northwest, northwest and by north and
northnorthwest. The north end of Fero is about four leagues broad, and
reaches northwest and southeast: it is called Fulo: Fulo.
against it lies the Bishop. Bishop.


If you desire to sail from Mulso into Somsond Somsond.
you must go northeast and by north three leagues, to the point of Bordenes,
then from Bordenes northeast, then you shall see a church upon the Island of
Calso, which you must leave on starborde, and go in westnorthwest, till you be
in the bought of the Island Ostro, and there ancker at seventeene or eighteen
fathom.

These Islands of Fero lie in a Triangle form: from the southeast end of
Suydro to Fulo or the north end of Fero it is northnortheast and
southsouthwest one-and-twentie leagues.

II. The situation of Hitland.
THe southwest coast of Hitland, that is, from the southerlyest point to the
northwest point reaches northwest and by north seven or eight leagues. On the
same northwest side right over against the Island Fulo, there lies a sandy
Baye, where you may ancker, but on the east side of that Baye it is altogether
foul. From the northwest and west point to the north end, the land of Hitland
reaches northeast and southwest about eighteen or nineteen leagues.

Three leagues north from the aforesaid west point lies the haven of S.
Magnus, S. Magnus haven.
which is a wide river, and there is good ancker ground within it: within it is
sixteen or seventeene fathom deep, as you are far within the land. On the
north side there lies a high rock, from which you must go in south: and on
the south side there lie two or three rocks, which you must leave on starborde
when you will sail in.

Right east about the southeast point of Hitland there lies a fair sandy
Baye, where you may ancker at twelve or thirteen fathom: and from thence to
Hanglip Hanglip.
the course is northeast, and somewhat easterlyer ten or eleven leagues.

Between Hanglip and the south point there lies an Island which you may sail
about on both sides, and behind it lies Hamburgher haven Hamburgher have^.
or the Scottish haven: it is a lading place for the Hamburghers and Scotts: it
is also called Bremer haven. There lies also a high steep point south from
Hanglip, which you must go by into the Breesond, Breesond.
which is the principal haven of all Hitland, for it is deep, and has fair
ground, and there you lie safe against all winds.

North from Hanglip the land of Hitland reaches north, north and by east, and
northnortheast, and lastly north: and in some places you may sail through
Hitland, specially north from Hanglip, where there goes a river northwest
through it, and it is a fair wide river, and there in some places it is good
ancker ground, for such as know it, and are forced to seek it. From Hanglip
to the northeast point of Hitland it is northnortheast eleven leagues: there
lie some out-rocks, which are called the Out-scheren. From thence to the north
point of Hitland it is north about four leagues.

Right about the north point, there is a fair haven, which runs in
southsouthwest, which is all sandy ground. On the west side there lies a long
rock, you must sail in by it on the east side, and ancker right within the
haven: it is all fair and good rode within it. This haven is called Blomesond,
Blomesond.
and goes in right west from the northeast point: and first (as I said)
reaches in southsouthwest, then south, and south and by east: on both sides it
is good ancker ground, you may there sail clean through, and come through
Iellesond into the Sea again about the Island Fetlo.

Thus Hitland shows when it is northwest and by west about four leagues from
you.
view of Shetland Thus Hitland shows between Hanglip and Hamburgher haven.

III. The situation of the Islands Fayrhil and Fulo.
THe Island of Fayrhil Fayrhil.
lies from the south end of Hitland southsouthwest seven or eight leagues.
Fulo and Fayrhil lie distant northwest and by north, and southeast and by south
eleven leagues. But Fulo Fulo.
lies about west and by north four leagues from the aforesaid south point of
Hitland. The south point of Hitland lies between Fulo and Fayrhil.

On the west side of Fayrhil in some places it is foul ground, but on the
southeast side it is good ancker ground, where you may lie at rode. Fayrhil and
the east point of Orcanes lie distant from each other southwest and northeast.

When Fayrhil is west and by south four leagues from you it shows thus.

IIII. Of the Tides and running of the streams about these Islands.
IN the Islands of Fero a north and south moon makes high water.

Under the Islands of Fero there runs a hard stream, which comes out of
the west and westnorthwest, and from the east and eastsoutheast, and so falls
through the Islands, so that you must there look unto it, and reckon your Tides
well, when you will sail from one Island to another, for there the stream
drives hard, and there are two principal wells or Mael-streames, Mael-streames.
the one on the southende of Suydro, and the other a league within Schalhooft
or Qualenes. But although the streams run so stiffly through these Isles, yet
it flows there hardly four foot.

In Hitland within the Rivers and havens a southsouthwest and northnortheast
moon makes high water. The streams there go east and west about, specially
on the south and north ends of Hitland, and so fall cross through the rivers
and havens.

V. How tbese Countries are distant from each other, and also from other
Countries.
FRom the north end of Hitland to the south end of Fero the course is west
and west and by north 59 leagues. From the south end of Hitland to Fero it is
westnorthwest and northwest and by west 61 leagues. From the south end of
Hitland to the Island Rona westsouthwest 47 leagues. From the north end of
Hitland to the rocks of Rocol westsouthwest 127 or 128 leagues. From the south
end of Fero to Rona s. and by e. 45 or 46 leag. From the south end of Fero to
Rocol southwest and somewhat westerlyer 81 leagues. From the Island Fayrhil to
the northeast end of Orcanes southwest 10 or 11 leagues. The Island Fayrhil
lies from the south end of Hitland southsouthwest and south and by west 7 or
8 leagues. From Hitland to the east point of Ysland northwest and by west about
133 leagues. In the thirteenth Chapter it is sufficiently showed how these
Islands lie distant from the havens and Islands of Norwaie both in breadth and
length.
VI. Under what height these Countries lie.
THe north end of Fero lies under 62 degr. 10 minutes. The south end of Fero
lies under 61 degrees. 15 minutes. The north end of Hitland lies under 60 degr
45 min. The south end of Hitland lies under 59 degrees 48 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 38.
CHAPTER XVII. A DESCRIPTION OF the Islands lying behind the Northwest point of
Scotland.
I. The situation and names of the said Islands.
WEst from Scotland and north from Ireland there lie many Islands, whereof I
will here describe some, in such manner as they are known at this day.

The names of the principal Islands Names of the Islands.
lying there are these, Aren, Ila, Iona, Mulla, Bragedul, Hun, Just, Leeus, S.
Patricius, S. Maria, S. Colane, S. Petous, Epth and S. Kilda: these are the
greatest and principalest. There are also some small Islands, as Rona, Cheut,
Trauta, Fladde, Grand Melul, Petit Melul, Scalpan, Cannay, Rum, Egghe, Mule,
Cut, Carndenburgh, Gronsay, S. Karbo, Lismont, Swinoy, Machare, Gegay, Caray
and Naversay. All these Islands lie about, and belong to Scotland, and are those
which by the Cosmographers are called Insulae Hebrides.

The Island Bar or Rona Bar or Rona.
is the northerlyest Island behind Scotland, it lies distant from Fulo about
westsouthwest eight-and-thirtie or nine-and-thirtie leagues, and it lies by
two other small Islands, more then a league each from other.

The Islands of Leeus are distant from Rona southwest sixteen or seventeene
leagues: and from the north end of Leeus to S. Kilda S. Kilda.
it is southwest and by west sixteen leagues.

Upon the east side of S. Kilda there is a good rode for a west, and northwest
wind: this Island lies by the other Islands, whereof two are not very great,
on that which lies west you may see some houses standing, and those small
Islands lie eleven leagues distant west from the great Island of Leeus. Upon the
coast of Leeus there lie two fair great rocks, as if they were Islands, they
lie south and north and somewhat easterlyer and westerlyer from each other,
about seven or eight leagues.

The southerlyest lie by three Islands, but the northerlyest lie by eight small
Islands or rocks. You must understand that the Island of Leeus Leeus.
is divided into many pieces, through the which you may sail to many places.
Leeus with his Islands reaches southsouthwest and south and by west about 29
leagues.

But on the east side there is a great River or haven through, of six or seven
leagues. You must sail into it close by the Island of Leeus, about s. s. w.
till you be before the Island of Cheut.

From thence the river between the great Island B^agadul, and Leeus reaches
through south and south and by west to the west end of Leeus, which is called
the Epths, Epths.
and then you leave Mulla and Ila with many other Islands on the left hand.

Iona, Ila, Mulla and Bragedul, Iona, Ila, Mulla, Bragedul.
are four of the greatest Islands that lie on the west coast of Scotland, they
lie close by the firm land, but there are many havens and rivers, so that you
may sail in and round about them all.

Upon the northwest point of Ireland there lie also some Islands, which also you
may sail through and round about.

Between Rona and Orcanesse there lie also Islands, which may also be sailed
into and round about.

Whosoever travileth into these parts may help himself with that description
which we have here made, till such time as we can get further and fuller
knowledge of them.

He that falls upon any of these Islands must look well to him self, for the
most part of them are inhabited by wild and cruel men.

In Leeus and the Islands there abouts a southwest and northeast moon makes
high water. The like also without the north-point of Scotland.

Thus S. Kilda shows when it is northnortheast 4 leagues from you, and then
the rocks lie west.
view of St Kilda (Scotland) When S. Kilda is about five leagues s. w. from you
then it opens thus.
view of St Kilda (Scotland) When the Island of Leeus lies ^ight leagues from
you it shows thus, and then you are within S. Kilda.

II. How these Islands are distant from each other, and from other Lands.
FRom Rona to Leeus southwest 16 leagues. From the north end of Leus to S.
Kilda s. w. 16 leagues. From the south end of Leeus to the northwest point of
Ireland southsouthwest about 27 leagues. From S. Kilda to the north end of
Hitland northeast and by east 70 leagues.
III. Under what degrees these Islands lie.
THe Island of Rona lies under 58 degrees 46 minutes. The north end of Leeus
lies under 58 degrees 18 min. The rock Rokol lies under 58 degrees 20
minutes. The northwest point of Scotland lies under 58 degrees. 30 min.
Here follows the Card N. 39.
CHAPTER XVIII. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Islands of Orcanesse or Orcades, with the
Seacoasts of Scotland.
I. Of the Islands of Orcanesse.
THe Island Fayrhil and the northeast end of Orcanes The north (...) point of
Orcanesse.
lie distant southwest and northeast ten or eleven leagues. This northeast
point is a high hill, whereby there are many points and Creeks: when you come
out of the south and are about it, then the land falls downward toward the
west, and you may go there in every where. Between Rona and Orcanes you
shall find an Island or two, under the which you may make a rode.

The Islands of Orcanes are one-and-thirtie in number. The Island Ways or Elhoy
Wa^s or Elhoy.
lies nearest to Scotland five leagues westward about the point of Catenes.
About northnortheast from the point Catenes there lie two Islands, which are
called Pits and Pichlandskarres, Pits and Pichlandskarres.
you may there go through between Ilhoy and Scotland toward the west.

North from thence lies an Island called Heynda, Heynda.
and another Island called Platta. Platta,
North from Platta lies Mayland or Ponoma. Ponoma.
On the north side of this great Island lie all the havens where the ships
enter into.

On the east side of this great Island there lies another Island, called
Kabunsa, north from it on the northeast point of that great Island there lies
another Island: when you will lie in the haven thereof you must go in there:
you may go through there to Papewester, Papewest^r.
and leave Sanda on starborde.

Close by Papewester lies Fara, ^ara.
south from it lies Sirza. East from Sirza and Fara there lie two Islands in
the middle of all the Islands, called Eeda and Chapuoza.

Sanda Sanda.
lies north from all these Islands: Papa P^p^.
and Stronsa St^^^sa.
lie south from Sanda. East from Stronsa lies an Island called Cruistella, that
is the easterlyest Island of them all: the northerlyest is named Ronalse Ronalse.
or Nordernanse.

Eleven or twelve leagues northwest from the great Island there lie two rocks,
one under the water, the other above: if you come out of the west you must look
unto them.

You may sail in through these Islands of Orcanes in many places, to wete, by
Catenes, and south from Sanda, and come out north again.

Thus the northeast point of Orcanes shows when you sail along by it.
view of the Orkneys Thus the land of Catenes shows, when you sail along by
it.
view of 'Catenes' (Scotland)

II. The situation between Catenes and the River or Creek of Edenborowe.
FRom Catenes to Buquhamnesse the course is southeast one-and-twentie leagues.
Between them both there lies a great creek, wherein there are many havens,
which are deep enough for great ships to enter into them, and where ships
may well lie at rode.

Southwest and by south from Catenes about sixteen leagues there lies an
out-point called Cabo Terbate: Cabo Terbate.
north from it lies Dornock, Dornock.
and south from it lies the haven of Ros Rosse.
and Luvernes: Lovernes.
from thence the land reaches east and eastnortheast to Buquhamnesse or
Boeckenesse. Boeckenes

Boecknesse is a high hill which lies on the south side of the point: right
north from Boeckenes there lies a fair Creek, as if it were a haven, which
is called Spy or Spieloort, Spyloort.
on the south side there is a single strand, there you go in by it.

Thus Boeckenesse shows when you sail along by it.
view of 'Boeckenesse' (Scotland)

From Boeckenesse to Aberdin Aberdin.
the course is southsouthwest twelve or thirteen leagues: but between them
both there lies a Tyde-haven. On the south side of Aberdin there lies a rock
half a league from the land, which you must shun. The north point is all
foul: you must go in by the south point at three or four fathom, till you be
within the haven, and you may sail further westward up to the town, and
ancker there at four or five fathom. Northward also there is a great water,
which is very flat, and dry on both sides, from thence there goes a chanel
to Old Aberdin which is a decayed town.

Three leagues south from the haven of Aberdin lies the out-point of
Stone-head, Stonehead
or the Torre, whereon there stands a castle: right south from thence the
Stonebay goes in, it is a deep creek, where you may lay many ships safely
at ancker: it is a good haven for ships that will go south.

Four leagues southeast and by south from the Stonebay or Torre lies the haven
of Monros, Monros
it is also a good haven: you must sail in westnorthwest through both the
lands, in the middle of the chanel, then you must turn up north, and ancker
before the town.

More then a league south from Monros there lies an out-point called Readhead,
Readhead.
on the land there stands a high steeple called Albroed. Albroed.
Four or five leagues south from thence lies the river of Donde Dunde.
or Dunday, which also is a fair haven, it goes in between two high lands
west and by north, till you be before the town. Within upon the River there
lies a town called S. John's, S. John's.
which you may go unto with a high water.

About southeast from the River of Dunde almost two leagues there lies a great
rock under the water, whereon it raveleth continually, it is called the Sheep,
The Sheep
if you come from the River of Edinburgh and will go northward, or if you come
out of the north and will go into the said river you must take heed of it.
Between the river of Dunde and Fisnes or the north point of the creek lies
the creek of S. Andrews, S. Andrews.
where there is a good rode for a westerlie wind.

Thus the land of Scotland shows north from Aberdin, when you sail along by
it three leagues from the land.
view of Scotland

III. How you must sail up the river to Edinburgh, and the situation from
thence to Coket Island.
ABout a league south from Fisnes lies the Island May, The Island May.
it is a great Island when you are in it, but no man can get upon it, unles he
be drawn up upon it in a carre or vessel: if you will go up the River you
must go about on the south side of May, and leave the Islands Bas and Heynkief
on the left hand. The Island of Bas Bas.
lies distant from May southwest and by south three leagues: but from Bas to
Heynkief or Inchkiet the course is west three leagues: you must sail north
about Heynkief, Heynkief.
for on the south side, along to the firm land it is all full of rocks and
very foul ground.

From Heynkief to Lies or Seton Lies or Seton.
the course is south and by west three leagues, there over all it is deep
enough, and there you may ancker on which side you will, you have good rode in
all places. On the south side thereof lies Edinburgh, Edinburgh.
the chief city of Scotland.

From the Island Bas to S. Abbenhooft or S. Tabs head S. Tabs-head.
the course is east five leagues, and from S. Abbenhead to the uttermost end
of Schassen it is southeast seven or eight leagues.

To go through within the Schassen The Schassen.
place the castle of Bamburgh or Badenburgh right over against the steeple of
Denstenburgh, and sail up upon it, then you go through between the Ploegh
and Goldstone, Ploegh and Goldstone.
which are two rocks lying between the Schassen and Holy Island, which lie
even almost with the water.

The Schassen reach northeast into the Sea three leagues from the land, and
north from them lies the Holy Island. Holy Ila^d or Land.
South from the Holy Island there is a Creek, wherein you lie safe against all
winds, and against the castle is the best rode.

To sail into Barwick Barwick.
coming out of the south, you must sail westnorthwest from the north point of
Holy Island, till you come before the haven, there you shall see two beacons,
you must sail in between the^ both, and so forward between the two ^oints in
the middle of the chanel right before the town.

From the Schassen to Coket Island the course is southsoutheast eight or nine
leagues. There a man may sail round about and ancker at four fathom. There
abouts also there run many little rivers into the land, but at low water
they are most of them dry.

IIII. What Moon in these places makes high water, and of the falling and
running of the streams.
AT Orcanes and Buquhamnesse a southwest and northeast moon makes high water.

In the haven of Lies a southwest and by west moon makes a high water.

The streams come behind Scotland from the west, and so fall through between
Orcanes and Fayrhil, and there a southwest and northeast moon makes high
water.

From Bokenesse to Lies the flood falls south and north along by the land.
And from Lies along by the Schassen and Coket Island southsoutheast.

In this chanel it is 40, 50 and 60 fathom deep, and at 45 and 50 fathom a
man may see the land. In this chanel the first herrings are yearly taken.

V. How these Countries lie distant from each other.
FRom Cattenes to the Island Hoy w. n. w. 5 leagues. From Catenes to C. Terbate
s. w. and by s. 15 or 16 leag. From the haven of Ros or Luvernes to the point
of Elgin east and by north and somewhat northerlyer 7 leagues. From the point
of Elgin to Spilort east 1^ leagues. From Spilort or Philort to Boeckenes s. s.
e. 3 leagues. From Catenes to Boeckenes s. e. and by s. 21 leagues. From
Boeckenes to Aberdin s. s. w 12 or 13 leagues. From Stonebay to Monros s. w.
and by s. 4 leagues. From Monros to Readhead south 3 leagues. From Dunde to
Fisnes southsoutheast 5 leagues. From Fisnes to the Island May southwest 1
league. From May to the Island Bas s. w. and by s. 3 leagues. From Bas to
Heinkief west 3 leagues. From Heinkief to Lies or Zeton s. and by w. 3
leagues. From Bas to Abenhooft or Tabs head west 4 or 5 leagues. From May to
Tabs head s. e. and by e. about 4 leagues. From Tabs head to Barwick
southsoutheast 5 leagues. From Cattenes to Boeckenes s. e. and s. e. and by s.
21 leagues. From Boeckenes to Lies in Scotland s. s. w. 33 leagues. From
Fisnes to S. Tabs head s. e. and by s. 4 leagues. From S. Tabs head to the
Schassen southeast 8 or 9 leagues.
VI. How these Lands are distant from other points and places.
FRom Boeckenes to the uttermost Island of Orcanes north and north and by west
32 or 33 leagues. From Boeckenes to der Neus east and somewhat southerly 88 or
90 leagues. From Boeckenes to the Texel southeast and somewhat southerlyer 118
leagues. From Lies to der Neus e. n e. and somewhat easterlyer 103 leag. From
Schassen to the Teese southsoutheast 21 leagues. From Schassen to Flamborowe
head southeast and somewhat southerlyer 29 leagues. From Aberdin to the haven
of Yarmouth s. e. and by s. 93 leagues.
Under what height these Countries lie.
THe greatest uttermost Island of Orcanes lies under 59 degrees 8 minutes.
Catenes lies under 58 degrees 32 minutes. Boeckenes lies under 57 degrees 50
minutes. S. Tabs head lies under 56 degrees 12 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 40.
CHAPTER XIX. A DESCRIPTION OF the North coast of England, from north of
Newcastle to Yarmouth.
I. How a man shall sail into the River of Newcastle and into the Teese.
SEven or eight leagues south from Coket Island lies Tinbuy or Tinmouth,
Tinmouth or Tinbuy.
which is distant from the Schassen southsoutheast fiveteene or sixteen
leagues. South from Tinmouth there lies an out-point called Sonderla: Sonderla.
between this point and Tinmouth the River of Newcastle runs in, wherein
there is twelve foot water at half flood. From the point of Tinmouth there
shoots off a stony banck, which you must sail in by, but the southeast end
is flat, there you may go in with the lead at ten foot half flood. The
marks to sail into this River are these: there are two fire towers which
stand on the north side of the haven, you must set them one over against the
other, and sail in upon the^, along by the said stony banck, until you are
in, and when you are within, first you must sail all along by the north side
till you are past the town of Tinmouth, then you must turn over to the other
side, and so you come into a crooked way which strikes up northward, and
having past that you must go southward to Haesoort, and so forward about
Haesoort to the town of Newcastle.

From Tinmouth to the Teese or Hartlepoole Hartlepool.
the course is southsoutheast eight or nine leagues. Hartlepool is a Peer or
Head, behind it at low water you may lie dry with your ship. Right south
from it the Teese The Teese.
goes in, it is a great wide and deep river, and reaches in westsouthwest,
with seventeene eighteen or nineteen fathom water, and there is nothing in
the way that can hurt or hinder you, you must sail in through the middle of
the chanel, and ancker before the castle of Wisten. In the innermost part of
this haven, that is before the town of Stockton, it is but four fathom deep.
Right east or south from the Teese there lie two chalck hills, called
Humplefoot Humplefoot.
and Read hill. Reddehil.


Thus the land between Coket Island and Tinmouth shows, when you sail
against it.

II. The situation between the Teese and Flamborowe head.
FRom Teese to Scarborowe the course is southeast and by east 11 leagues.
Between the^ both lies Whiteby, Whitbye.
which is a Peer or Tydehaven, which at low water is dry, so that as the^
you may there lie dry. On the east side thereof there shoots off a
stone-banck, which you must shu^ne. If you will go into Whitby you must sail
in between the two beacons, till you come between both the lands. Between
Whitbye and Scarborowe lies Robbenhoods baye: it is a fair rode for a
southsouthwest and west winds, there you may ancker at seven or eight fathom.

Skarborowe carburgh
has two peers or heads, you may go behind them at high water, and at low
water lie dry: you must sail in south from them.

From Skarborowe to the point of Philo P^ilo.
the course is southeast three leagues. Southward about you may sail into the
Bay of Philo: it is a round Baye, which at low water is dry. But without the
head of Philo there lies a rock under the water, which is called Philo crack.
Philo crake.
Between this stone and the Peer a man with a ship of two hundred tonne may
lie aslote at five fathom low water, and there lie safe against a northeast
and east winds.

Three leagues west from Philo lies Flamborowe head, Flamborowe head.
which is distant from Scarborowe southeast and northwest five leagues.
Flamborowe head has many white patches and chalck hills, specially on the
north side to Philo: on the south side it has a head or peer, and a league
west about the point lies Berlington, Berlington.
which also has a peer, you may ancker there in the Baye or Creek at six or
seven fathom.

This is the form of the land between the Teese and Flamborowe head, when you
sail along by it.

III. How you shall sail up the River of Humber to Hul, into Boston, and to
Lin.
FRom Flamborowe head to Kelbese Kelbese.
or Ravenspurre the north point of Humber, Humber.
the course is south and by east about eight or nine leagues, there is is all
flat water five, six, seven and eight fathom deep. To sail into the River
of Humber when you come out of the south, set Poltoren right upon the north
point of the River, and sail up upon it, so long until the steeple south from
Doepenton comes between the trees and the other steeple, then sail in
westsouthwest and west and by south to the first middle flat, then sail
north or south about till you be before Grimsby, there is the rode at six or
seven fathom, and there you lie behind a Middle-flat: from thence further
inward the course is west and by north, and west northwest to the end of the
banck, which reaches along the haven on the north side: when you are at the
end thereof, then you must turn up northward in the river of Hul, there
within it is six, seven, eight and nine fathom as you lie, and there it
flows three fathom up and down, with dead stream. An east and west moon
makes a high water there.

If you will go into Boston river Boston river.
you must go along by the land of Slegnesse, and sail close in by the foot
strand, and so you shall not sail by Elleknock. When the three trees stand
south from Somkil or the speere steeple, then Elleknok lies right to seaward
from you, then you may sail forward along by the land of Leeck, at three or
four fathom, to the river of Boston.

You may also come again into the Sea between Elleknock and Long sand, Long
sand.
at three fathom. Between the chanel of Boston and the chanel of Lin it is
all full of Sands and shallowes, so that it is very needful there to take a
Pilot for him that will sail there, it flows there three fathom up and
down, so that with ships that draw not much water you may go over the
sands at high water. An east and west moon makes there a full Sea between
the Sands.

From Flamborowe head to Chapel or the Sonck it is south and by east nineteen
or twenty leagues. The Sonck is a Sand which at low water is seen: west from
it the east chanel of Lin goes in.

To sail into the haven of Lin Lin.
sail westward about the Sonck, and place the heap of trees over against the
point of Sitsem or Suytsom, and Chapel east from you, and then go in
southeast and by south, then you shall find the first tonne, then south and by
west and southsouthwest, and sometimes somewhat westerlyer till you be about
the point, the tonnes and the beacons will show you the way: when you are
about the point, then you may run through the sands into the north chanel,
and sail through it into the Sea again, by the tonnes and marks thereof.
This north chanel reaches northeast and northeast and by east, it is very
well marked and beaconed.

When you will sail into the aforesaid east chanel of Lin coming out of the
north, then you may sail in west from Sonck, that is, south and by east in,
and so go between the Sonke and Chapel south and by west to the first
tonne: and so from the tonne by the beacons, along to Lin before the town.
When you come out of the east, you may go along by the land within through the
Sonck, close by Chapel, and so south and by west to the first tonne aforesaid.

IIII. The situation of the Havens and Banks lying between Chapel and
Yarmouth.
FRom Chapel to Cromere the coast reaches eastnortheast, east and by north,
east, and east and by south: between them both lies Burnham, Burnham.
Wels and Blancknye, which are tyde-havens. From Chapel to Burnham the course
is east southeast three leagues. If you will put into Burnham you must go in
at a high water, you must place the steeple against the black, and so sail in
by the beacons, leaving them on baghborde.

Between Burnham and Wells there lies a bank which you may ancker behind
at five or six fathom, but upon the bank it is but two fathom deep at half
flood.

Five leagues east from Burnham lies Wells: between Wells and Blakny there
lies a Sand called the Pol and the Peper, Pol or Peper.
it lies fast to the land, and there it is shallowe or flat far into the
Sea, which you must shu^ne. On the west side of this Sand the haven Wells
Wells.
goes in, and the beacons stand all along by the Peper, when Hobrom stands
southsoutheast from you, then you are west from the Peper, and there is good
rode (as I said before) at six fathom. Then Wells lies southeast from you,
and then the trees stand against the steeple, you may then sail openly into
the haven of Wells, along by the beacons.

Blackney Blackney.
is a Tide haven going in on the east end of the Pol: at Blackney there
stands a high steeple, which may be seen a great way into the Country,
when that high steeple is against the small steeple, then you see the first
tonne, lying upon the east or south end of the Pol, then go from tonne to
tonne till you are within the haven.

From Blackney to Cromere Cromere.
the course is eastsoutheast four leagues, and from thence the land reaches
southeast and by east to Haesberghernesse four leagues. Right south from the
Admirals house lies Haessant or the banck of the Admirals house, you may sail
through between this Banck or Sand and the land at two fathom. But without it
is eight or nine fathom deep: when Winterthon Winterthon.
lies west from you, then you are south from this banck. A little to seaward
from this banck lies Winterthon Sand: when Winterthon lies southwest from
you, then you are at the north end of Winterthon sand.

About northnorthwest and north and by west from Winterthon sand lies the
banck before Cromere, Banck before Cromere.
which lies at least five leagues from the coast of England. When you come out
of the north, you may go through between Winterthon sand and the Banck of the
Admirals house at ten or twelve fathom within the banks, till you come to
Yarmouth. But between Kockling and the land it is but four or five fathom
deep. Kockling is a Banck lying against Keson: when Keson is against the bunch
of trees which stand there, and upon the flat steeple which stands upon the
water side, then you are south from Kockling.

Against Kockling there is a chanel in the Sea along through the Holmes: if you
will go through it out into the Sea, then set Keson against the wood, and then
sail out of that chanel, you shall there have five or six fathom deep, but
on the south side it is the deepest water.

When the speere steeple of Winterthon is north from the small steeple, then
you may also go through between Winterthon banck, and the Holmes into the
Sea, and there you shall have ten or twelve fathom deep.

These streams aforesaid are the principal places, where the greatest number
and best herrings are taken, which men keep all the year and send into other
Countries.

Thus the north coast of England shows between Cromere and Yarmouth, when
you sail through between the banks.

Keson. Winterthon. Haesbergh. Cromere.

view of England

V. Of the running and falling of the streams about these places.
NOrth from the Teese the flood falls southsoutheast along by the land.

Against the river of Newcastle and the Teese the flood falls southeast, and
the ebb northwest.

Against Scarborowe and Flamborowe head the flood falls southeast and the
ebb northwest.

From Flamborowe head to Blackney the flood falls southeast and the ebb
northwest.

Against the bancks of Cromere and Winterthon the flood falls southsoutheast,
and the ebb northnorthwest.

VI. What moon makes high water in these places.
BEfore the River of Newcastle a southwest and northeast moon makes high
water.

In the Teese and Hartlepool a southwest and northeast moon makes high water.

At Robbinhoods baye and Scarborowe a southwest and northeast moon makes high
water.

At Philo and Flamborowe in the Peer a westsouthwest moon makes high water.

Before Humber and Lin a w. s. w. moon makes high water.

In the river of Humber and of Lin an east and west moon makes full Sea.

At Burnham, Wells, and Blackney an east and west moon makes full Sea.

Before Cromere a southeast moon makes high water.

Without the banks of Yarmouth a southeast moon makes high water.

VII. Of the depths against these Countries, and at what depths you may see
them.
YOu may see Scarborowe upon the hatches of the ship at five-and-fortie
fathom.

You may see Flamborowe head also at 45 fathom.

North from Humber you may see the land at 25 fathom.

When you come from Flamborowe head and will go to Flanders or the Heads, then
you go over a Sand of nine or te^ne fathom: this Sand is called the Well,
which goes through the whole north Sea, against Heliger haven, and there it
ends, by our sailors it is called Dogghers sand or White Banck, by Englands
side it is the shallowest, for there it is but ten fathom and, sometimes
deeper as twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fiveteene and sixteen, and so forth
still somewhat deeper till you be at the Holy land. That which lies south
from this banck toward the Heads is called Deepewater, which is in the place
where the Buyses fish in Harvest time: there it is two-and-twentie,
four-and-twentie, six-and-twentie and eight-and-twentie fathom deep.

That which lies north is called Bynorth, it is thirty, five-and-thirtie,
forty, five-and-fortie and fifty fathom, and sometimes sixty fathom.

North and by east from Blackney there lies a banck, whereon at half flood
there is no more then five fathom water, and at eighteen fathom you may see
the land: there to the point of Chapel it is all flat or shallowe.

Northeast and northeast and by north from Cromere there lies also a banck,
whereon there is but four fathom water at half flood, from thence you may
easily see the land.

Winterthon sand lies about four or five leagues from the land, and northwest
from Winterthon.

Against Winterthon and Cromere seven or eight leagues into the Sea, it is
eighteen and nineteen fathom deep, and there you may see the land.

VIII. How these Places lie distant from each other.

point of Humber lies under 53 degrees 20 minutes.
Here follows the Card N. 41.
CHAPTER XX. THE DESCRIPTION OF the Seacoasts of England from Yarmouth to the
Foreland: and also the situation of the famous River of London.
I. How to sail into the Rodes of Yarmouth and Leystaf.
TO sail into the rode of Yarmouth through the Holmes, place the speere
steeple which stands within the land north from Yarmouth, right against the
broad castle, or place the mill on the north side of the town: keep these
marks standing so, and so go in westnorthwest, you shall not find less
water in that chanel then eight or nine fathom at half flood. This rode is
called S. Nicholas rode, S. Nicolas Rode.
and on the north side it is deepest: when you are within it, then the rode is
five or six fathom right before the town.

Against the haven of Yarmouth there goes a chanel also through the Holmes: to
sail through it coming from the south, then set Suython over against the
north side of the have^, and the great tree between Northon and the flat house
or castle, and sail upon them, and keep those marks standing so, till you
are within the Holmes, and when you are within, then there lies a Sand on the
right hand, right north from the haven, called the Middle ground, Middle-ground.
you may go about it on both sides, to landward at five fathom, but toward
the Holmes, or east about from them eight or nine fathom. This banck reaches
north to Keson and Cockling.

To go into the rode of Yarmouth coming from the north you must go along by
the land, as I said before: you may also sail so along by the land to Leystaf.

To sail through the Holmes of Yarmouth into the rode of Leystaf, Leystaf.
then mark the brew house which lies north from Leystaf: when the mill which
stands on high is over against the Brew House, then there goes a chanel west
and west and by south through the Holmes, there at half flood it is two fathom
deep, and before the brew house there the rode is five fathom deep. When
Leystaf steeple is west and by north and westnorthwest from you, then you are
at the south end of the Holmes, you may sail in there to the south or north
rode, and ancker south from Leystaf, or else north, before the brewhouse, that
is the best rode.

II. The situation between Leystaf and the Nase.
FOur leagues south from Leystaf there stands a high speere steeple called
Cochey, A banck against Cochey.
against it to Seaward there lies a banck, but you may sail through between
the land and this banck at three fathom with half flood: when the steeple of
Cochey is westnorthwest from you, then you are south from the banck, but when
Ees is southwest and by west from you, then you are on the north side of the
banck.

South from Cochey lies Swolle, Swolle.
which has a haven that at half flood is two fathom deep: but between
Swolle and Orfordnesse lies Dunwich. Dunwich.


From Leystaf to Orfordnesse or Abre the course is south te^ne or eleven
leagues. Southeast eight leagues from Orfordnesse Orfordnesse.
lies the Nase. The Nase.
Between them both lies the haven of Harwich. More then a league
eastsoutheast from Abre lies Abreknock: and between Abreknock and Orfordnesse
lies Whiton or Whitesand.

East northeast from Abre, about half a league from the land there lies
another banck, which at low water is no deeper then a fathom and an half, and
is fully as big as Witting-sand or Abreknock: between the land and this
banck it is at least ten fathom deep: this banck is flat so that you may
sound it round about with the lead.

To sail from north into the Sands of Harwich, Harwich.
you must keep the north side at seven or eight fathom, so long until Ware

map of England with inset of the River Thames that Abre be north and by west
from you, then you are north from Whitsand, then you come against Orwel haven,
then you must put somewhat off from the land, and go on south and by west,
about without Basil sand, until Basil comes on the south side of the Clif,
and when Basil is on the south side of the Cliffe, and Harwich against the
north side of the haven, there it is good rode at five fathom half flood.
Between Basil and Harwich there lie two Sands more, whereof the southerlyest
is called Talguer or Taliver, Taliv^^
which you must shun.

You may also go in between Abreknock and Whitsand at six fathom, but
within it is ten fathom deep: being there within, you may go along by the
Koert or Koertsand at five fathom, to the Nase. When you come so far that
Harwich steeple comes into the valley of Heyningh, then you go forward
southsoutheast, till you be about the Nase. This Koersand (which also is called
Koert) lies right before Harwich, and along from the Nase to Abreknock.

Between Abreknock and Koersand there also runs a chanel east and by north
into the Sea: when Basil is behind that read Cliffe, then you may go out
there east and by north, and in west and by south.

To sail into the haven of Harwich, Harwich haven.
when you come out of the north, then mark a flat steeple, which stands
within the land, with a heap of trees: when that steeple is against the trees,
then go in a cables length from the north land northnorthwest and northwest
and by north, (for that is indifferent fair) till you are within the
fishing-place. In the middle of the mouth of the haven there lies a Sand
called Otter: Otter.
when you have past the fishermens stakes, then turn up westward before the
town, and there ancker at six or seven fathom half flood, or at low water at
five or six fathom.

But if coming out of the south from the Nase you will go into Harwich, then
place Harwich steeple in the valley of Heyningh, which stands upon the land,
and hold it standing so, (going northnorthwest) till you come by the north
land, then sail upon the north point of the haven, until Harwich steeple
comes without the point of the land, then sail in about a cables length by
the north side, and do as I said before.

III. How you shall sail into the River of London, called the Thames.
SOuth from Koersand or Koert there goes a chanel east and by north, and
eastnortheast into the Sea: to sail into it, place Walton, (which lies south
from the Nase) west and by south and westsouthwest from you, and sail so right
upon it west and by south, and westsouthwest, until Harwich steeple comes in
the aforesaid valley of Heyningh: if then you will go to Harwich do as I said
before. But if you will go to the Spits, then go southwest along by the north
land, for that is fair and flat, and you may well sound it, and leave the
long sand Goenvliet on baghborde, Goenvliet o ^^gsand.
and go not near unto it, for there it is very shoring, the nearer to it the
deeper water, sail forward as I said before, until S. Oges steeple, which
stands there upon the high land (being a speere steeple, which is also called
the Spits) be over against the red tyled house, which stands on the water
side against the white Cliffe, and they will then stand about north and by west
from you, keep them standing so, and go south and by east, and southsoutheast
along over the Sands, there at half flood it is three fathom water, but look
well to your streams, for the flood falls strongly along by the north land
to Colchester haven: not long since there ha^pened a ship to be cast away on
the east side upon Long sand, which lies soncke there, the mast thereof still
showing above the water, being now a very fair beacon, and a certain mark,
for those that will go in or out that way, for when you come against the
Sand, you shall presently see it, leave it on baghborde when you will go
inward, and sail your course aforesaid, until you find deeper water again,
to wete, six or seven fathom, there you shall find a tonne: when you come to
the tonne, then go southeast to Whitakers beacon, Whitaker beacon.
and from thence forward southsouthwest and southwest and by south to the
beacon upon the Shoe, from the Shoe beacon Shoe beacon.
to Black tail westsouthwest, and being past it, then you come into the reach
of the Sea or the chanel, and then the beacon upon the Noore or the Loer
stands about southwest from you, leave it on baghborde, and go then in the
middle of the chanel to Gravesende.

To sail up the River of Thames from Margat, To sail from Margat up the
Thames.
sail along by the land, two cables length from it, until the Recolvers be
southsouthwest or south from you, then you come against the beacon called the
Spill, then you must put somewhat off from the land to the Lassen, and sail
between the tonne and the beacon, there you shall find it three fathom deep
at low water, and five fathom at high water. From thence go forward to the
I Will of Sheppie, Sheppie.
and sail along by it within two cables length from the land, and when you are
past Quinborowe, then put somewhat off from the south side, to shun the Noore
or Loer, which comes shooting off from the point of the south land, but there
stands always a beacon upon it, whereby you may know it, you must sail
along by it, leaving it on baghborde, when you are past it, then you enter
between both the lands into the chanel of the Thames, it reaches east and
west, there you must sail in the middle of the chanel to shun the Sands,
which lie on the north side of the river, and sail so forward inwards to
Gravesende.

To sail into the north chanel off from the Foreland, then place Margat
steeple over against the white sandbaye, which lies west from Margat, and go
northwest and by west, then you shall find the first to^ne, lying on the south
side of the north Lassen, from thence to the second tonne the course is west
and west and by north, it lies upon the point of Lassen, you must leave them
both on starborde, southward over against the second tonne stands the beacon
upon the Spil, leave it on baghborde when you go in: when you are against this
tonne, then the Recolvers stand south from you. From the tonne upon the Lassen,
or the beacon upon the Spill, over the Swalve to Sheppie the course is west and
by north, and westnorthwest, but look well to your streams, for the flood
falls very strongly into the Swalve: when you come to Sheppie, then hold
Quinborowe over against the trees, which stand in the middle upon the I Will of
Sheppie, or without upon the point of the land, and go close by Sheppie,
within two cables length of the land, to shun the point of the Spaniard, The
Spaniard.
which comes shooting toward Sheppie, and then go forward to the chanel, as
I said before. In the chanel between the tonne upon the Lassen and Sheppie it
is flat water, and is not used by ships that draw much water, but such as
will go with great ships along by the Foreland up the river, they sail
through the fishermens chanel, Fisherme^s chanel.
and as soon as they are past the tonne upon the Lassen, they go first
northward, and so come out against the point of Blacktayle, from thence they
sail westsouthwest to the chanel, as I said before.

IIII. How to sail out of the River of London.
IF you will sail out of the River of Thames, then go from the beacon upon
the Noore eastnortheast to the beacon upon the Shoe. Now when the beacon upon
the Shoe is on your left hand, then you are in a good way, for there it is
eight or nine fathom deep. From the beacon upon the Shoe to Whitakers beacon
the course is northeast, and northeast and by north, when you are somewhat past
it, holding the same course, there you shall find a tonne, which coming to,
you shall see a speere steeple standing on the land, and a white or read house
upon the side of the land, place that house and the steeple one against the
other, and sail north and by west upon them, then you shall go over a Sand of
three fathom deep at half flood, which Sand is called the Spits: when you are
over that Sand, and have six or seven fathom deep again, then go northeast
toward the point of the Nase, till you come to it, the^ leave Goenvliet on
starborde. From the Nase there reaches a chanel east and by north, and
eastnortheast into the Sea, if you will sail out there, then place Walton in
the valley south from the Nase, and then go east and by north and
eastnortheast into the Sea, through between Goenvliet and Coersand.

When you come off from the beacon of the Shoe and are past Whitakers beacon,
and come near unto the tonne, then there runs a chanel eastnortheast into
the Sea, of five, six or seven fathom deep: this chanel is called the Kings
or Queens chanel. The Kings chanel.
There lies a Sand on the south side called the Muys, The Muys
the foot whereof reaches far into the north. They that should desire to sail
out at this chanel, coming eastnortheast from Whitakers beacon, should easily
miscarie behind a point or foot of Sand, which reaches about half way out
from the Muys. On the north side of the chanel lies Goenvliet, which at low
water or half flood is dry. Against the north end of the dry sand there
lies a banck shooting off, which is two fathom deep at half flood, which
banck is called Westrocks, Westrocks
it is very stony and uneven: you must shun it.

But if you will sail from the Thames to the Recolvers, then place the steeple
which stands above Lee haven a lever or bow length south from the heap of
trees, keep it standing so, and sail to it, until the steeple of Whitstaple
comes against the black hillock, which is there within the land, Marks of
the Spaniard.
now when those marks are one against the other, then you are against the
Spaniard, and you can not sail by it from Lee haven with such marks.

V. Of the running and falling of the streams against these places.
Between the Holmes and Yarmouth, and the banks of Harwich the flood falls
south and the ebb north.

Between Orfordnes in the chanel the stream falls southsoutheast. Between
Orfordnes and the Foreland the streams fall without the Sands south and by
east and southsoutheast.

From Dover to the Foreland the flood runs within Goodwin sands, through
over the Quernes north, and the ebb south. But by the Foreland in to the
Recolvers the flood falls westsouthwest and west and by south. About without
Goodwin sands the flood falls north and by west and northnorthwest, then also
the flood comes there from the north and meet together, and so falls into
the Sands and channels.

North from the Galper you can recon no ebb, but that which goes along by
England about the north, nor no flood more then that which goes south about.
The streams (as I said before) fall there most as the Coast stretches.

The floods out of the north and from the south meet each other about the
Galper, and so fall with great raveling over the sands toward Flanders.

In the chanel between the Flemish Banks and the Heads the stream goes
about with the Son, so that it falls but little along the Seas.

VI. What Moon makes high water in these Places.
Without the banks of Yarmouth a southeast and northwest moon makes high
water.

But at Yarmouth a southsoutheast moon makes full Sea.

At Leystaf and Orfordnes a southsoutheast moon makes high water-

And at Harwich also a southsoutheast moon does the like.

Before the Thames a southsoutheast moon makes high water.

Within the Thames a south and by east moon makes high water.

At the Foreland a south and north moon makes full Sea.

VII. Of the depths and Banks about these Places, and at what depths you may
see the land.
FOur leagues about east and by south without the B^nkes or H^lmes of Yarmouth,
there lies a banck called the New Sand, it is but two fathom deep.

Five or six leagues without Yarmouth and Leystaf southeast and by east in the
Sea, it is seven-and-twentie and eight-and-twentie fathom, and being there you
may see the land.

Against Orfordnes you may see the land upon the hatches at two-and-twentie
fathom.

About east from the Nase seven or eight leagues into the Sea there lies a
banck called the Galper, it is five, six and seven fathom deep, and lies
about thirteen leagues northeast and by north from the Foreland. On it the
stream alwaie raveleth much.

The west Rocks lie southeast from the Nase about three leagues distant, there
on them it is but two fathom water at half flood, and it is stony ground.

Without the Sand of Harwich five leagues from the Nase it is twenty and
two-and-twentie fathom deep, and th^re you may see the land.

Five or six leagues north and by east and northnortheast from the Foreland,
or from Margat, there lies a banck called Kintersknock, it is three fathom
deep, being there you may see the land just upon the hatches. Five leagues
northward from this banck it is twenty fathom deep.

Without Goodwin sands it is eight-and-twentie and nine-and-twentie fathom
deep, and you may see the land of Dover and the Foreland: but go no nearer to
Goodwin sands by night then sixteen fathom.

In the middle between the Heads it is two-and-twentie and three-and-twentie
fathom deep.

VIII. How these Lands and Places are distant each from other.
From Yarmouth to Leystaf within the ba^ks it is s. 5 leagues. From Leystaf to
Abre or Orfordnes s. 10 or 11 leagues. From Abre to Abreknock e. s. e. more
then a league. From Orfordnes to the Nase southwest 8 league. From Orfordnes to
the Galper s. s. e. 10 or 11 leagues. From Orfordnes to Kinterknock south and
by west 16 leagues. From the Nase to the Foreland south and somewhat easterlyer
13 leagues. From Kinters knock to the Foreland s. s. w. about 7 leagues. From
the Foreland to the north end of Goodwin sands southeast and by east 1 l^ague.
The point of Dover and the south end of Goodwin sands lie distant southwest
and northeast.
IX. How these Places are situate from other Countries.
FRom Yarmouth or Leystaf to the Texel or Marsdeepe east and east and by north
33 or 34 leagues. From Yarmouth or Leystaf to the Mase eastsoutheast and
somewhat southerlyer 37 leagues. From Yarmouth or Leystaf to Walcheren or the
Wielings southeast, and southeast and by east about 34 or 40 leagues. From
Orfordnes or the Nase to Texel e. n. e. 37 leagues. From the Nase or Harwich to
the Mase east and west 29 leagues. From the Foreland to the Texel or Marsdeepe
n. e. 45 leagues. From the Foreland or Goodwin sands to the Mase eastnortheast
and somewhat easterlyer 33 leagues. From the Foreland to the Wielings east and
