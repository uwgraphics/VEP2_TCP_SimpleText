CVM PRIVILEGIO Regiae Maiestatis.

Viro Iurisprudentia, pietate, and aucthor^^ate praestantissimo, Edmundo
Anderson Militi, Regiae Maiestati Iudici primario ciuilium actionum, patrono
suo omni obseruantia colendo, W. West iudicijs diu ac foeliciter praesidere ex
animo optat.
SF squiannus iam est (Vir ornatissime) ex quo primum hoc opus
Symbolaeographicum opera curaque mea sub faustiss^mis nominis tui auspicijs in
lucem foeliciter prodijt. Cogitari certe quidem vix potest qua^to hominu^
studio atque applausu (te patrono) fuerit acceptu^, adeo vt nihil vnqua^
eiusdem generis ipsis gratum magis aut probatum haberetur. Veruntamen
quemadmodum alijs etia^ in rebus vsu venire assolet, nihil primo vt nascatur
perfectum: Itidem and in hoc negotio non potuit non contingere, quin nonnulla
nec plene, nec accurate satis polita atque descripta essent: Quinimo plurima,
partim quidem desiderata, partim vero redundantia, partim etiam indigesta
essent. Quibus quidem incommodis ipse aliquando mederi constitueram, quod ne
integre praestare pocuerim, multa me etiam hactenus impediunt. Nam (si quod
verum est libere fateri liceat) quamprimum Typographus exempla omnia priora
(spe citius) distraxisset, ne speratum inde lucrum diutius expectaret, me
tandem ex improuiso nil tale adhuc somniantem, immo alio destinatum, de noua
etia^ editione statim ineunda summonu^t: vehe^^enter rogitans, vt teneram atque
informemistam prolem, laeto vultu agnoscere, fouere, ac ad vrsae instar
relambere non dedignarer. Illius autem petitioni honestae certe, (mihi tamen
tunc temporis plurimis magni momenti negotijs implicato non satis aequae) non
potui non assentire. Ex quo enim, hanc comme^tandi prouinciam semel
suscepissem, nihil prorsus mihi potius tentandum videbatur, quam vt, in quo
congerendo aliquantulum a me iam elaboratum est, in eodem etiam digere^do atque
honestando diutius adhuc immorarer, ipsumque denuo typis excusum auctiorem,
adeoque emendatiorem exhibere curarem. Quae igitur tantillo tempore ad hanc rem
confer potuit mea tenuitas, ea omnia libentissime contuli. Cumque in illa
priore editione Hebraea aliquot, Graeca autem non pauca, interseruissem, illa
nunc omnia ne imperitioru^ studia ac progressus, obscuritatis specie, linguaru^
ignorantia remoretur, penitus sustuli: ipsorum potius vtilitati, quam meae
aestimationi inseruiens. Nam, vtcunque se res habet, ex vsu mihi omnia
aestimanda atque approbanda videntur. Quod vero iam postremu^ atque omnium adeo
maximum est (vir illustrissime) vt hos meos labores qualescunque, non minore,
quam illosid genus priores, benignitate excipere, and patrocinio iam secundo
tutari velis, te etiam atque etiam rogo. Te denique (Iurisconsultissime)
eternus Iudex, non Anglicano tantum Regno, Regiaeque Maiestati serenissimae sed
vniuersis quoque verae Iurisprude^tie vere studiosis quam diutissime seruet
incolumen. Vale, Rotheramiae, Maij octauo.

Tui honoris studiosissimus W. West.

FINIS.
THE FIRST BOOK OF SYMBOlaeography, describing the Method and form requisite
to be observed in making of Instruments Extraiudiciall.
What Symbolaeography is.
SYMBOLAEOGRAPHY is an Art or cunning, Sect. 1.
rightly to form and make written Instruments.

Symbolaeography, is either judicial, or extraiudiciall.

Symbolaeography extraiudicial, is the first part thereof, which is altogether
occupied in the description of such Instruments, as concern matter not yet
iudicially in controversy.

Which be of two sorts, namely, Instruments of agreements, or Contracts, and
of Testaments, or last wills.

For the easier understanding whereof, before we take in hand to describe them,
it seems convenient in some sort briefly to peruse and set down the several
natures of Contracts and last wills, and of such Obligations in law, as they
breed the stuff or matter (whereof such Instruments are to be made:) beginning
with Obligations.

Obligations.
The definition or description of obligations and the causes thereof.
AN Obligation therefore is, the second head, in which the right Sect. 2.
of persons is seen: al whose substance consists not in this, that it should
make any body or service ours: but to bind another to us, to give, do, or
perform some thing.

Hereupon an Obligation is defined the right of a person by which he has an
other person bound unto him, to pay that he owes.

And it stands in this point, that some thing be done or performed: And the
same either a thing, or a person, and either the thing it self, or the
interest or damage, or both together.

And all the doctrine of Obligations consists either in making of an
Obligation, or in the dissoluing of the same, when it is made.

The constitution or making of an obligation rests in the causes and manner of
making thereof.

The supreme cause (which is also common to all other effects of law) is
right, the inferior cause thereof is the act of man, which rather gives
occasion of thobligation, then induces the same.

For although to the making of obligations, the mind and will of man be very
necessary, yet thereof arises thobligation, not for that a man wileth, but
for that right and fact grants such obligation to arise: And on the other
side it happens often, that a man will not be bound, and yet nevertheless is
bound if he commit any such thing by which right will have him to be bound, as
in Obligations with offenses.

Right therefore is the chiefest cause of obligations, the fact of man the
remote cause, sine qua non: that, the principal cause, this, the secondarie.

And therefore it is termed the bond of right, or law.

Of Obligations, some be simple and some mixed.

A simple or single Obligation is that which leans upon right only, that is
natural right, or civil right only.

Which so is either natural or civil.

The natural Obligation is that whereby a man is bound to yield that only which
he owes naturally: And that is also called the right of the Law of nations.

A civil Obligation is whereby a man is bound by civil Law, to render that
which he ought ciuilly.

A mixed Obligation consists of both laws, natural and civil.

In every Obligation the one is called the creditor, or obligee, the other the
debtor or obligor: And by diverse other more special names, according to the
sundry forms of Obligations and Contracts: as feoffor and feoffee, lessor and
lessee, grantor and grantee, donor and donee, vendor and vendee etc.

The creditor is he to whom any thing is due by obligation.

The debtor, he that is bound.

Such is the distinction of obligations by the efficient and original cause
thereof.

Of the fact of Man.
NOw the fact of y^ person and the person himself are to be considered Sect. 3.
The fact is the covenant or agreement or thoffence, which two are the only way
of making obligations.

The person is he which either agrees or offends, and beside him none other.

And both may be bound either mediatly or immediately.

Immediately if he which is bound do agree.

Mediately, when if he which by nature differs from him, but not by law
whereby as by some bond he is fained to be all one person, does contract or
offend, of which sort in some cases be those which be in our power, as awife, a
bondsman, a servant, a factor, an Attorney, or procurator, exceeding their
au^thoritie.

Of Covenants and agreements, and who may make them.
A Covenant is the consent of two or more, in one self thing to give Sect. 4.
or to do some what.

This consent is here of them which both by nature may consent, and to whom it
is by law permitted to consent.

For all which by nature can consent, cannot also consent by law.

But all may consent of what Sex soever they be, male or female.

But age hinders some, and some the defect of the body, as dumbnes, deafnes,
blindness, and some the defect of mind, so that they cannot consent.

Age hinders those which be within the age of xxi. years: defect of the mind
those which be of full age. And nature both with the consent of law, but not
all after one sort.

Infants which understand not what is done can therefore neither Minor.
make Obligation, nor Covenant, either civil or natural which may take
beginning at their persons, except such as be of the age of discretion, that
is, males of the age of xiiii. years, and females of xii. years, which may
covenant and be bound in some cases, as for necessary food, raiment,
schooling, instruction, and marriage etc. or as executor to an other. Doct.
Stud. li. 2. cap. 27.

The vice or defect of the mind, as madness, Lunacie, Ideocie, hinders
Furiosus, Lunaticus, Ideota.
the making of agreements, and contracts.

Of Consent true or feigned, or in deed and in Law.
FVrthermore, the consent in Covenants, is two ways considered, Sect. 5.
the one as it is true or feigned: the other as it is pure or conditional.

I understand, that to be a true consent, which comes unto the Consensus
verus.
fact of man, appointed unto that end, that by the same he may be said to
consent: of which sort it is, almost in all Covenants, And this true consent is
sometimes expressed, and sometimes concealed, or implied.

A true consent expressed, is that which is declared by word or deed: by
word, either uttered by mouth, or showed by writing or messenger.

The consent secreet, or concealed is, when one does consent by not dissenting:
Whereas in the mean^ time he might have hindered thact done, if he had disagreed.

So that an express consent is always in deed, and asecret consent in Law.

For they, between whom there is nothing expressly agreed, concerning the
nature and essence, which a covenant has by law, are understood secretly to
consent to the nature of the Covenant which is appointed by law.

The feined consent is by Law for some fact, when the consent of Fictus
consensus.
both parties appears not, and yet in as much as the fact is done, they are
by law both feined, and deemed to consent, for the nature and reason of the
business, which is between them both.

In a true Consent we make choice with whom we will covenant: In a fained
consent we happen upon him casuaily: In the true consents, our wills conioyne
us, In the feined, fortune, or rather Gods providence. In true consents we
begin at the fact of man: In the feined, at the law.

Of pure Obligations and Covenants.
ANd as far forth as the consent is either pure or conditional, Sect. 6.
so far forth by that quality some Covenants and Obligations be pure, and
some other condicionall.

Obligat^o pura, pure Obligation is that, which is, and has being forthwith,
not being suspended or stayed with any Condition.

Which sometime is pure simply, when the agreement is such, that by force of
the Obligation, it may by and by be performed with effect: sometimes pure after
a certain manner, and that by the adding too of time certain, unto which not
the obligation (which already is made) but the performance thereof is deferred.

Of conditional Obligations or Covenants.
A Condicional Obligation is that which is deferred to some chance, Sect. 7.
whose whole effect rests in this, that if the Condition happen, it may be
drawn back to the very time of the agreement, and be holden, even as the
agreement had bin originally pure.

But it behooves the Condition to be possible in deed and in Law, otherwise
the agreement is void.

Of bare Promises.
A Consent in covenant, is sometime alone, and somteime with cause. Sect. 8.
Consensus solus. Policitatio.


A sole consent consists in promise and agreement.

A promise is a covenant offered by one freely, which is of none effect in the
law to produce an Obligation, if there be no cause why it should be done.

Of bare Agreements.
AN agreement by sole consent, is a covenant consisting within Sect. 9. Pactum
and placitum, vel pactum nudum.
the bonds and limits of his pleasure that makes it: And therefore it is called
with us Nudum pactum, which of his own nature breeds no Obligation. As if I.
S. promise to pay x. li. to P. L. not having quid pro quo 9. H. 5. fo. 14. For
if a man promise to do or make any thing, and no agreement being made what he
shall have for his labor, it is Nudum pactum, 13. H. 6. 36. Of which sort bin
all natural Obligations: as recompensing, requiting, and other bare promises
without lawful consideration.

Of Contracts.
A Covenant or agreement which has a cause, is termed a Contract Sect. 10.
Consensus cum causa
which is nothing else but an agreement with a lawful cause or consideration,
Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. cap. 24.

A cause is a business which being approved by law, makes the obligation rise
by the contract, and the action upon the Obligation.

There are two principal heads to be observed in the learning of Contractuum
distributio.
Contracts: the one pertains to their substance or nature, the other to their
adjuncts or accidents.

The substance of Contracts.
THe substance of al Contracts consists in consent, as their matter, Sect.
11. Materia and forma contractuum.
and in the cause or business as their form,

Yet that consent which is common to all contracts also distinguishes them,
and that by the diversity of the manner of consent which is used in Contracts.

For consent is sometimes used indeed, and sometimes fained, as in law: so of
contracts, some be true, and some be fained.

True Contractes, be contracts having a true consent ordained to Contractus
verus.
that end that the contract may be made, and thereof an Obligation or bond.

Which true consent is always interposed of both sides, whether it be expressly
or secretly: insomuch, that if there be any error or deceit in the consent or
thing, for which the contract is entered into, that contract is either made
altogether none, or of none effect.

Therefore the true Contracts be those, which are by mutual consent of both
parties: which consent is therefore interposed that the contracts may be, and
that either both or the one may be bound thereby, and both those things even
from the beginning.

But if you mark the end and effect of contracts, there is no difference
Contractuum est. ctus.
amongst the^ at al, but al equally, as well fained as true co^tracts breed
obligations, which obligations so bred bring forth actions.

Again, true contracts be distinguished by their cause, which is common
Con^ractuum ^^^saco^munis
to them al in general, namly that in all contracts, some thing be given or
done: But in some, law has set and distinguished the business or cause in
certain limits, in which it has forsaken y^ common nature.

And an act so long as it appears not, whether it may be referred to any
certain business defiued within certain limits, or no, is left in his general
kind, and that common nature: as for example, when I give I S. money that he
may give me some thing of his, In general certes this contract is, I give, that
he may give. But when law has severed and desined by certain notes, this
business wherein a certain price is given for a certain thing, and has given
thereunto a peculier name, it may be called buying and selling. We are not now
to look back to the general name, I give that I. S. may give, but to the
lowest species or kind that is buying, selling, and the nature thereof. But if I
give thee a thing that thou may give me a thing of thine, that act or
business abides in the general name, I give that thou may give, because y^
law has set down no certain contract whereby one thing (other then money) may
be given for another, neither truly by nature could certain names be given to
all and singular businesses: for that they be infinite: but words or names be
infinite, and circumstances diverse.

Yet profit and y^ frequent use of certain businesses has brought to pass that
a certain form and name might be, and also is given unto them.

Hence of true contracts, some be named, and some unnamed.

Of named Contracts.
NAmed Contracts be those which have a cause by law defined, and Sect. 12.
they are called by proper names.

The same also be termed certain, because they are certain in their Contractus
nominati.
form, certain in their number, and briefly certain in their name.

Besides these all the rest are uncertain, as staying in that their general
appellation or name.

And it is to be understood of named contracts, which is said in the rule of
contracts, that in a perfect contract there is no place for repentance, that is,
that a man can not swerve from a Contract named perfect, either party being
unwilling, nor except all things be wholly restored, but that the same must
altogether be co^summate, and either the thing contracted be performed, or if
that cannot, in steed thereof the^ interest or damages thereof.

And though those contracts only be named which have received both name and
form of our Civil Law, and thereby it is to be esteemed, whether they may be
said to be contracts named or unnamed: yet have they not al one self
beginning, For some be said to be of the Law of nations, and some of the Civil
Law.

Of Contract^ of the Law of Nations.
THose Co^tracts be of the Law of Nations, which have their cause Sect. 13.
Contractus Iurisgentium.
by the Law of nations, received with all men, but have received their certain
form and certain name from our civil Law.

Which be two fold, for certain are made by the thing, and certain by consent.

Verily there be diverse such contracts that may be made upon some thing,
neither is there any wherein it is not needful that consent be: But the same
in some more, and in some less.

As touching those that are perfected by the thing, the matter stands
Contractus rei.
thus, that their cause (that is to say) giving, consists in this point, that
it behooves the thing always to be present, and necessarily delivered to
perfect the Contract. But in other co^tracts, albeit they be made concerning
some thing, yet it is not needful that the thing be present, but it may be in
one place, and the contract celebrated and perfected in an other. Whereby it
happens that the contracts perfected with the thing, and the thing it self
whereof the contract is, and the very contract it self are oftentimes called
by one self name, which is otherwise in other contracts.

Herehence we may define real contracts, to be contracts whereby Contractus
reales.
the thing being delivered and accepted, we are bound to the restitution of the
same thing, but if that cannot be, the value or interest thereof.

Whereof there be two kinds, the one consists in loan and lending, the other in
disposition and gaging. Lending is respected in the thing and without the thing.

In the thing is considered, either the property thereof, or y^ use thereof.

The property of the thing is transferred in loan by delivery unto him which
borrowed it.

The use of the thing in commodation, is applied unto him unto whom the thing
is lent.

Without the thing, is the keeping and the security thereof called Depositum,
which is a thing left in another man's keeping, and this is termed a pledge,
gage, or pawn.

To al which iiii. kinds this own thing ought to be common, that they be free
without usury and price, for if any price or thing be given therefore for them,
they degenerate into the nature of other contracts.

Of Mutuation or lending of things which cannot be restored.
Loan or lending Mutuatio, is a real contract, whereby we so give Sect. 14.
Mutuatio.
a thing consistingin quantity that he which receives it, may render the same
again to the lender, in kind and nature, but not the self same thing in deed:
the thing that is lent, is properly called Mutuatu^, Mutuatum.
he which gives, the lender, and he which receives, the borrower.

In loan termed Mutuum, the lender must be owner of the thing Mutuum.
lent, and also in delivering of the thing, he must convey the property
thereof unto the borrower: because things so lent are so given to be used, that
they cannot be used, except they be consumed. And it is therefore called Mutuum,
quasi ex meo tuum fiat, Doct. St. li. 2. cap. 28.

But no other things may be given in loan, but those only which consist in
quantity, that is, those which are wont and may be numbered, weyed, or measured,
as money, corn, wine, cheese, lead, etc.

And those may receive function in genere, that is, one may be, and also truly
is used for an other, that although that the thing restored is other then that
which was received in specie infima, seu indiuiduo, yet in that, that a thing
of the same kind, goodness, and quality is rendered, it seems to be altogether
the same.

In loan therefore the same quantity and quality do cause that thing being
diverse in indiuiduo, to be all one in genere. Hence it is that the same things
are restored that we lent not in indiuiduo, (because that single thing that was
lent cannot be restored, for so much as it is consumed by use: or if it be not
consumed, yet the property thereof is conveyed unto the receiver) but in kind
and goodness.

Number is attributed to money etc. measure, to corn, wine, oil, etc. weight,
to cheese, lead, and such like of the same sort.

Of Commodation or lending of things which may be restored.
COmmodation, is a Contract real, whereby any thing is granted Sect. 15.
Co^modatio.
freely to be used of any one, that eue^ the very self same thing in deed may
be restored, and not in liew thereof an other of the same kind, as a horse, a
book etc. Doct. and Stu. li. 2. cap. 28.

The thing lent is called Commodatum, the lender Commodans, the borower
Commodatorius.

But Co^modatum, is properly when a thing, is delivered to an use and purpose
certain, which at the last being ended, it ought to be restored and not before.

For if the thing be so delivered to be used, that it must be restored to the
lender whenever it shall please him, then it is termed Praecarium, Praecarium.
or a loan at will.

Of deposition or leaving with an other.
DEposition, is a Contract real in which a thing moveable is freely Sect. 16.
Deposition,
given to be kept, that the self same thing be restored whenever it shall
please him that so leaves it. Do. St. lib. 2. ca. 28.

The thing left is called Receptu^, commendatum, or depositum. the leauer,
deponens, the receyuer depositarius, the keeper thereof. The nature of this
Contract is in the free keeping of the thing left, and neither in the use, nor
abuse thereof.

This keeping is either of a thing Litigious, or not Litigious, the thing not
Litigious is properly that which we call depositum, which is sometimes left of
set purpose, and sometime through urgent necessity as in these three cases of
ruin, shipwreck, and burning.

Of Sequestration.
THe keeping of a thing Litigious is called Sequestration, which Sect. 17.
Sequestratio^.
is therefore defined the deposition of a thing in controversy.

Which is conuentionall or judicial. A deposition conuentionall, is made with
the wills of the parties between whom the controversy is.

This does take the possession from the parties in controversy, and gives the
same to the Sequester or indifferent man to thend he may deliver the same to
him that recouereth it, except perchance it be expressly so agreed that the
Sequester shall only deteine and not possess it.

A judicial Sequestration is made by the authority of a competent Magistrate,
eue^ against the will of both, or of the one of the parties.

This takes not away the possession, but because it is doubtful, it leaves
it in suspense until the parties be either friendly agreed concerning the
suit, or it be declared by judgment, who is and ought to be possessed thereof.

Sequestration judicial ought not to be made, but upon urgent causes, as to
avoid fighting and breach of peace etc. or if the destruction of the thing
Litigious be feared, or the party suspected to become fugitive or
insufficient, or if there be any other danger in delay: But deposition of
things moveable only, and sequestration may be of things immovable.

Of Pledging and gaging.
A Pledge is taken sometimes generally, and sometimes specially, Sect. 18.
and both of them are sometimes of the covenant, and sometimes of the thing
which comes into the covenant, Do. St. li. 2. cap. 28.

Pignus generally taken, is a covenant by which right is appointed Pignus.
to the creditor in the things of another man, that his debt to him may be so
much the surer: which very right is not seldom called a pledge, so that a
pledge may be of the covenant, or of the right of a thing, and briefly of the
thing in which that right is appointed.

And a pledge is either proper or improper: an improper pledge is Hypotheca.
called Hypotheca, which is of a thing not delivered, which is made and
perfected by covenant only, As in clauses of distress, clauses of nomine
penae, and other penalties for not performing of covenants etc.

It is either expressed or implied.

Expressed is that, when it is expressly agreed, of what thing it should be, as
a clause of distress for a rent charge.

And this is always by express consent of the parties only.

An improper pledge employed is that which is induced by the Law alone, yet by
some occasion thereunto given by some act of man, which is not principally,
and by the will of man appointed to make a pledge: although that by that thing
which is done, the man doing it is presumed to agree to the pledge: as when
goods be brought into an other man's land, liable to the distress of a
stranger, for rent or other moveable things bound by the operation of Law.

A pledge so termed specially, is a pledge delivered to the creditor sometimes
by the debtor, and sometimes by a magistrate.

Of Pledges necessary or voluntary.
ANd therefore a pledge is either necessary, or voluntary, or conuentionall.
Sect. 19.


A necessary pledge is that which is received by compulsiue authority of a
Magistrate.

A pledge voluntary or conuentionall, is a pledge delivered by the covenant of
both parties.

A pledge is ever of the debtors own things, namely of such as may be bought
and sold.

For the gaging of the goods of another man is void, if it be not with the
will and consent of the owner thereof.

And a pledge may be pawned to another, yet subject to the first condition, for
prior tempore est potior iure.

Fruits and things growing may be pledged.

Of Pledges general and special.
ANd a Pledge may either be general, which is of all a man's Sect. 20.
goods.

Or special which is of some part of them only.

And all the right of pledges or gages, consists in the security and
assurance of the thing due to the creditor. Do. St. lib. 2. cap. 28.

Of Contracts by consent.
SVch be the Contracts by the law of nations which are perfected Sect. 21.
with the thing. Those which are perfected by consent do follow.

And obligations accrewing of these are said to be contracted by consent, not
because these alone have consent in them, but for that to their parfection, the
presence of the thing whereof the contract is made is not desired, nor words
nor letters, but sole consent suffices which yet many times is interposed with
the thing, and by thaccesse thereof perfected.

Hereupon contracts by consent are defined contracts, having cause placed in
sole consent, to this end and intent, that a business certain may be done.

And these contracts by consent are partly in the thing, and partly about the
thing.

In the thing, namely either of the property or of the use thereof.

About the thing, as of communication or fact.

Of Buying and selling.
COntracts of property are buying or selling: Of use, are letting, Sect. 22.
taking, or hyring: Of communion, society: Offact, is commandment.

And buying and selling Emptio, venditio, is a contract by consent Emptio.
Venditio,
of the having of a thing, by or for a certain price.

In which he that must deliver the thing is named the seller, and he that ought
to pay the price thereof the buyer.

The substance of this contract consists in the thing sold, and in the price
thereof.

What things may be sold.
ALl things may be bought and sold whereof a man may have property Sect. 23.
or ownership, as horse, kine, etc. corn growing upon the ground, Tithes not
severed, 21. E. 3. 11. 21. H. 6. 43. hay growing 27. H. 8. 25. 11. H. 4. 32.

Al goods, chattels immovable, bondmen, and other things not being by law
prohibited (as stolen goods, horses into Scotland, fremen) may be sold.

Also a man cannot buy his own goods.

The price in buying and selling in money. ^^etium


For one thing given for another, is not price, neither if it so happen,
Permuta^io.
it is buying and selling, but exchanging, Permutatio.

The price is certain when it is either expressed in the bargain, how much it
is, or ought to be, Or if not certainly expressed, yet some relation is made to
some thing, whereby it may be made certain, As if the vendor says, he sells
it for so much as he bought it, Or for so much as I. S. shall arbitrate, It is
certain enough til I. S. have denied to declare the certain price thereof,
14. H. 8. 19.

Of payment and delivery of things sold,
THe payment of the money and delivery of the thing sold are effects Sect. 24.
of buying and selling, but not the very substance thereof. 14. H. 8. 19. for
buying and selling is perfected, by the certain appointing of the thing to be
sold, and the taration of the price thereof, with the mutual consent of the
buyer and seller, which consent in and about one self same thing works all.

Of letting or hyring.
LEtting and hyring, locatio, conductio, is a Contract by consent of Sect. 25.
the making or using of some thing for a certain re^t, hier or wage.

He which lets, lesseth, or sets any thing to be made or used, is called
properly Locator, the lessor or lettor: He which takes or hyreth it,
Conductor, the lessee or hyrer.

Letting and taking is either of a thing, or of the diligence of man.

And all things which may be bought and sold, may also be letten except such
only as consume by use. As corn, wine, oil, money, and such like, which may
not be letten: But houses and land and quick beasts, as sheep and oxen which
by nature yield increase, may be letten.

The letting or hyring of a man's labor, is as it were the use of a man in the
making or doing of some thing, As in the making of an house, a clock, a
garment, in doing of a days work by a laborer etc. Or the use of an house of
lands etc. for life, years, or at will for certain rent.

Of Society, Communion, or Fellowship.
Society is a contract by consent about a thing to be had and used Sect. 26.
Societas.
in common on both sides.

And the society or communion of things may happen between many of diverse
causes, of which, two be most principal: One by hereditarie discents or
executorship: As when lands descend to heirs or coparceners, or when a man
makes diverse executors, or administration is committed to diverse. The other,
when a thing is purchased or gotten by diverse, by gift or legacy, or some
other such single title.

But that only is properly called Society, which by mutual consent is applied
to that end, that there may be partnership or fellowship amongst the persons
contracting: wherein so soon as they are fully agreed, the one is properly
called the others fellow.

And the same society is in the goods and things of all the companions, or of
one, or some of them only, and in the labor to be done by them all, one, or
some of them, about such goods or things. And again in communicating of gain
and loss after the putting of such things in fellowship or barter, and
performing of their labor there about.

So in Society are regarded the goods or things of which the communion is
made, And the diligence and labor to be employed in and about them, And the
damage or profit which of them both or by thoccasion of them, or the same
society contracted, may grow or arise.

And the whole does consist in negotiation, as in buying, selling, traffic,
or merchandise.

Of a Society general or special.
Society in respect of goods is either general or special.

A general society of goods is of al goods: which contract has Sect. 27.
this one thing peculier unto it self, that so soon as the partners are
agreed thereupon, all their goods are by law common in property and use to each
and every of them, without delivery of any part thereof to cause a property.

A special society of goods, is of certain goods only, and the same either
one thing only, as of an horse, ox etc. to be bought: Or of some certain kind
of marchandises or wares, or other things, as corn, oil, spices, beasts etc.

Again the general society of goods is so of all, that it extends to all
things of the partners or fellows. But in the special society of goods, it
may be that the one only conferreth the goods, and the other no goods, but
bestows only his labor and diligence, which then is in steed of goods.

For labor is oftentimes of as good regard as money, yea and some times much
better, which causes that even the poor being industrious, may have
fellowship with the rich.

Therefore in general society of goods, the one of the partners sometimes
yields more goods, and the other less, the want whereof is intended to be
supplied by the other parties labor and diligence, al which depends upon the
agreement and will of the parties thereunto.

Of Gains and Damages.
Gain is that which remains when al damages and expenses, Sect. 28. Lucrum.
which the principal or goods put in barter, are deducted.

Damage is that which wants when the expenses are drawn from Da^^um.
the principal, or things put in barter or fellowship.

Of Commandment or Commission.
ACo^mandement or Commission Mandatum, is a contract by consent Sect. 29.
to do something gratis or freely.

He which commands is called Mandans or Mandator, he which is commanded may
be called Mandatarius.

Commandments or Commissions do properly rest in the deed and not in the
thing, albeit the thing do sometimes come unto the fact.

And that fact commanded is either in judgment, or out of judgment.

A Mandate or commandment therefore is either touching some controversy, or
the doing of some other businesses.

And every commandment is general or special. And the general either with
free administration or without it.

And the other person so commanded may be termed an Attorney, Proctor,
Procurator, Steward, Bailife, Factor, Ouerseer, or Governor of other men's
businesses.

For an Attorney is he which administreth, or does another man's business by the
commandment of the owner thereof.

If the party commanded have any thing for his pain, it is not then properly
commandment, but Location and Conduction.

These Mandatorie contracts are determined by death or will, of either of the
Contractors, if the deed be yet undone.

By death natural.

By the will of the parties, as if either the Commaundor revoke his Mandate: Or
the party commanded renounce and refuse to execute the same.

Of Contracts named of the Civil Law of Stipulation.
SVch are contracts named of the Law of Nations, Those follow Sect. 30.
which are of the Civil Law, which contracts are either made by word or
writing.

Stipulation is a contract made by words only, by an Interrogation or question
preceding, and a fit answer to the same following, for the giving or doing
of some thing or business: as give thou: I give: will thou do this: I will:
which is no binding contract in our Law, if no lawful consideration preceede,
but Nudum pactum, of which before.

Of Contracts by writing.
THe other Contract of Civil Law is made by writing, as the Sect. 31.
former is made by words. And that rather for the declaration and proof of
the Contract before made, then for thessential making of the same.

For a written Band, is a Contract whereby any man confesses himself by his
writing orderly made, sealed, and delivered, to ow any thing unto him with whom
he so Contracteth.

And if the thing were due before the making of such writing, then such duty
when such writing is so made, is due both by the cause, for which it became so
first due, and by such writing, wherein it is so described: by the first
naturally, by this ciuilly. And if it were not due before, then it was not done
ciuilly, by virtue of y^ writing only. Nevertheless it is to be noted, that by
accepting of writing of a Precedent contract, or of any part thereof of the
party, the contract precedent, is altogether determined thereby 3. H. 4. 17. 29.
H. 8. but not if a stranger be bound 29. H. 8. for no contract can be
apportioned or divided, 9. E. 4. 1.

Obligations and contracts do not forthwith spring of all kind of writings
mutually given by the parties, for some are made only for the testimony or
memory of things done, to the end to preserve the^ and win credit unto them,
but not to the end to procreate or breed any bond or contract, as histories,
private Inuentaries, private notes of remembrance, certificates etc.

But if I. S. by his writing duly sealed and delivered, confess him self to
owe to T. N. x. l. the proof that he made the same bond, makes him debtor of
so much, albeit there was never any other contract thereof between them, but
such writing only, neither is it necessary that the creditor prove any more,
but only the delivery of such bonds or writings thereof.

Of namelesse Contracts.
ANd true Contracts named, be of such sort: besides which, all the Sect. 32.
rest be unnamed, which be true contracts, having no certain name by the
Civil Law, and yet containing in them a civil business, whose form is
general, not defined within any certain limits.

Of which sort be all those contracts of which it is either doubtful, or else
certain that they can be referred to no Ciuilll Contract named.

A Civil business is, if any thing be to be given or done for some cause.

Of these unnamed contracts there be two kinds, the one may be termed a
contract upon the cause or permutation.

A contract upon the cause is a contract unnamed, made by consent wholly for
some lawful consideration, when some thing ought to be given or done, or not
to be given or done, As assumption and oaths. Assumption is made for the most
part with such words as I give thee that, that thou give or do that: or I do
this that thou shall give or do that. As if I. S. receive of D. D. an horse or
any other thing, and promise in consideration thereof, either to deliver the
horse sound again, or forty shillinges, or if I. S. give D. D. ten
shillinges, in consideration that he shall give him some other thing, or do
some act for him.

These contracts in respect of the sum certain expressed, resemble the
contract of buying and selling: And in respect of labor to be taken about the
doing of the fact, they counterfeit Location and conduction by reason of the
wages: which if it were not set down, they would represent commandments,
which nevertheless fully iumpe not with any of those three contracts named,
neither may they rightly challenge any of their names.

Of Permutation or Exchange.
PErmutatio, Permutation is a namelesse contract consisting in Sect. 33.
the thing and consent, by which one certain thing is given and exchanged for
another, as an Ox for an Horse, or bread for flesh etc. which name of
Permutation, although it seem fit for this business, yet it is rightly
termed a namelesse contract in law: For albeit it counterfeit buying and
selling very near, for that either thing given in exchange resemble both the
wares and the price, yet because it cannot be discerned thereby whether is the
buier, and whether the seller, it cannot usurp that title.

And so those contracts of the Case, Assumption and Permutation, be therefore
said to be namelesse, because their appellations or names be so general, that
no one named contract is able to comprehend the^, yet is the knowledge thereof
wonderful necessary for the apt framing of Instruments.

Of improper contracts.
TRue or proper contracts are so described: Contracts improper or Sect. 34.
fained succeed.

A Contract improper, is a contract made by a consent fained by the law, for
some deed happening in the same, that is to say, in the which there is no
manifest certainty of both the parties consent: but yet according to the
reason and nature of the business, a consent is by law fained to come on both
sides, as the administration of an others business without request, and
gardenship, the communion of things, as amongst Iointenants, Coparceners,
tenants in common, joint executors, and joint administrators, joint legataries
or donees, by payment of that which is not due, the receiuor is bound to make
restitution, and deteining of goods in which another has property.

Of Contracts mediate and immediate.
THere be also contracts of the fact: and a fact cleaves to the person, and is
in it, from which it is never separated: but the right Sect. 35.
which resembles and arises of the fact of the contract, namely the
obligation may be gotten to another then him that made the contract.

And sometime it comes to pass that one man bargaineth, and a another man
obtains the obligation, whether that other be bound, or another by the same
contract be bound to him.

An Obligation by contract is gotten either mediately or immediately.

Immediately by a man's own proper contract.

Mediately where the contract is made by another, As a contract made by the
wife with her husbands commandment, consent, or assent, 20. H. 6. 22. 27. H.
8. fol. 25. 21. H. 7. fol. 40. 14. H. 7. 2. R. 2. or by a Bailey known, 27.
Ass. P. 5. or by his servant, factor, or Attorney, 8. E. 4. fol. 11. 22. E. 4.
fol. 6.

Of the adjuncts of contracts.
WE have hitherto spoken of those things which pertain to Sect. 36.
the constitution of the very substance of contracts: their adjuncts follow.

Of which adjuncts some be interne and some externe.

Of which some be Co^tracts bonae fidei, others be strictiiuris, Those be
contracts bonae fidei, by which that is performed which seems equal and
good, although it was not once thought of by any of the parties at the making
of the contract.

Of which sort be accommodation, deposition, pledges, buying, selling, letting,
hyring, society, commandment, permutation, assumptions, and other contracts
upon the case, gardenships, doing of others businesses, communion of things
hereditary, and all other communions.

Contracts of the strict law, are those by which that only is performed, which
is expressly couenanted.

Of which kind be lending, and all other besides those above mentioned, In
these the rigor of the law, in those, equity rules. Sundry other contracts
there be of this kind, which to avoid tediousness I pretermit.

Externe adjuncts be those which are so in the contract, that they may also be
absent from it: but in it only then, when it is so couenanted.

For but that it is so couenaunted, they would either altogether not be
therein, or if they were therein, it should be by the only auethority and
disposition of the law.

Of these externe adjuncts, some may be adjoined to every contract which are
called Common, and some proper to certain contracts only.

Common externe adjuncts, be covenants, accessions, and delays annexed to
Contracts.

Of Adjuncts, some add some things unto the contracts, some take some thing
from them.

Adjuncts which add something to contracts, are penalties, warranties, or
other securities.

Adjuncts taking from contracts, be such as diminish the price agreed upon in
the beginning.

Of Accessions to contracts.
ACcessions, Accessiones contractuu^, to contracts be these things Sect. 37.
which be required beside the principal things themselves, whereof the contract
is made: As all costs and damages, (...) by occasion thereof, Or limitation of
circumst^^^^^ of rane, (...), person, etc. to perform Contracts.

Of Delays.
DElay (Mora) is that lingering or prolonging of the performance Sect. 38.
of Contracts, which happens by the slacknesse ^^het of the creditor, or
debtor.

Much more might have bin said of those contracts and offeines, of which
Obligations springs and arise, all which we willingly have omitted, as not much
necessary for our present purpose. In this discourse of Contracts necessarily,
(as we think) we are in like manner to entreat briefly of estates, possessions,
and properties, by which things are conjoined unto persons.

Of Estates and properties universal, and fee simple.
AN Estate, Status, dominium, proprietas, is that right and power Sect. 39.
whereby we have the property or possession of things: that is, whereby we be
owners or possessors thereof.

All Estates be either universal or particular: An universal estate is an
estate in fee simple, which is, when a man has lands or other things
inheritable, to him and his heirs for ever, so that thereby it is perfectly
his own: and therefore we call it universal, because it comprehends in it
self all other estates.

Of particular Estates, and of Fee tail.
A Particular Estate is every estate which is not so universal, and Sect. 40.
may also be said to be of two sorts, that is a particaler estate of
inheritance and of a term.

A particular estate of inheritance, is an estate tail or limited, that is an
estate expressing in certain, whose issue, and of what six shall inherit, and
it is general or special.

A general estate tail or limited, is when the estate limited expresses
not between whom the issue inheritable must be engendered: As if the gift or
conueyance be to a man and the heir or heirs males, or heirs females of his
body lawfully begotten, not naming upon what woman: Or to a woman and to the
heir or heirs males or heirs females of her body lawfully begotten, not
naming the man by whom it should be begotten, in which case, every heir of
their bodies lawfully begotten may inherit, by what wife or husband soever. Or
shortly thus: an estate in general tail is, by which any issue of the donees
body lawfully begotten may inherit.

An estate tail special is, when it is certainly set down between whom the
issue inheritable shall be engendered. And this special estate tail is either
expressed or employed. An estate in special tail expressed is, where it is
specially limited what issue of the donee shall inherit. An estate in
special tail employed is, where it is not expressed specially what issues of
the donees shall inherit: as by gift in frankmariage, which is, where a man
gives lands with his Daughter, or other kinswoman, to an other in
frankmariage, which word frankmariage amounts to as much, as if he had said to
the donees and the heirs of their two bodies lawfully begotten, Litt. Sect'
17. As if the conueyance were made to a man and a woman, and the heirs of
their two bodies lawfully begotten: or to a man and the issue which he shall
beget upon the body of A. D. Now may no issue take any benefit by that
conueyance, but such only as are between them two lawfully begotten: And this
manner of estate is properly called a special estate tail: But if either of
them die before they have such issue between them, then the party suruyuing
is improperly called a tenant in tail, and therefore for distinction fake, we
term such furuiuor tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct.

Of Estates of freehold.
A Particular estate which is but only a term, is an estate determinable
Sect. 41.
by limitation of time, and it is of two sorts: namely an estate of
franktenement, or a chattell.

An estate of franktenement, is where a man has the freeholde of land, and it
is either an estate of franktenement, created by the operation of the law, or
by the act of the parties.

An estate of franktenement created by the operation of the law, is either by
the common law, or by statute. An estate of franktenement by the common law, is
either dower, or by the courtesy of England. An estate in dower is, where the
wife is endowed of the third part of such lands as her husband had any such
estate of inheritance in, as the issue which by possibility she might have had
by him, might by possibility have inherited the same land of the same estate:
For dower exassensu patris, ad ostium Ecclesiae, and de la plus belle, as
seldom used at this day, I omit.

An estate of franktenement by the Courtesy, is an estate for the term of life
of the husband in all his wives land whom he suruiueth, having had issue by her
borne alive, which might by possibility if it had lived, have had, and
inherited the same lands of such estate as the mother therein had, during the
couerture.

An estate of franktenement by statute is, either by virtue of a bond
knowledged according to a statute, or by reason of some execution.

A franktenement by Statute, is either by virtue of a statute Staple, or of a
Statute merchant.

A franktenement by virtue of an execution is, either by reason of some
Judgment in some of her Majesty's Courts of Record: or else by reason of some
recognisance: it is when the moitie of the Recognisors lands be delivered to
the Recognisee to hold to him as his frehold til his debt be pated. But these
estates of freehold growing thus by Statute, are not properly but improperly
termed freehold.

An estate of franktenement growing by the act of the parties, is an estate for
the term of a man's own life, or for term of another man's life. For the term
of a man's own life, as if land be leased to any man to have and to hold to him
during his life.

An estate of franktenement for another life is, when lands be assured to him
for the life of I. G. or any other then the lessee himself.

Of estates of Chattels.
A Particular estate which is only a chattell, is either certain or Sect. 42.
incertaine, and it grows either by the act of the parties, or by the law.

By the act of the parties is a lease for the term of certain years having a
certain limitation when it shall begine, and when it shall end or determine,
as if lands be leased to I. G. To have and to hold to him and his assigns
from such a day, naming some day certain, past, present, or to come for xxi.
years, or any other certain number of years agreed upon between the leassor
and the leassee.

Particular estate certain growing by law is, that estate which the Guardian
has in his wa^des lands, during his nonage.

A particular estate incertaine, is an estate at will, or at sufferance.

Of possession in law and in deed.
AN estate at will is where the leassor grants his lands or other Sect. 43.
things to the leassee, to have and to hold to him, at the will of the lessor.

And it is to be remembered, that estates may be in possession, and out of
possession. Possession is in law or in deed.

And a possession in law is when the law only is the efficient cause thereof,
and it is either by common law, or by statute. By common law, as if the father
or other ancestor die seized of lands, the law casts the possession in law
upon the heir before his enter by force whereof he is tenant to every man's
Praecipe: by statute is, that possession which Cestuy que use, has in lands
limited to him in use 27 H. 8. cap. 10. before his actual enter into the
same. An actual possession or a possession in deed, is when the owner enters
into the same in deed. An estate out of possession is of two sorts, to wit, in
remainder, and in reuersion.

Of Remainders and Reuersions.
AN estate out of possession in remainder is, when a particular estate Sect. 44.
is granted to one man, the remainder to another at y^ same time by one deed,
As if a grant be made of lands for years, life, or in tail, to I. S. the
remainder thereof to T. N. for life, years, fee, or in tail.

A reuersion is such an estate depending upon like particular estate but not
being created all at one time, by one deed: as if I. S. seized of lands in
fee, grant the same to T. N. for years, life, or in tail, that which after
such particular estate remains in the grantor, is a reuersion.

Also every estate is either executed maintenant, or executorie by limitation
of use, which vesteth in possession by virtue of the statute of 27. H. 8. And
lastly, every estate is either absolute or conditional.

Of Instruments, their definition and causes.
Having thus generally and briefly run over the doctrine of Co^tracts, Sect. 45.
Obligations, possessions, estates and properties so far forth as seems
behoouefull for the description of the several Instruments of all manner of
Contracts. It is now time to enter into the discourse of Instruments themselves
the very proper matters and object of Symboleography.

An Instrument therefore is a formal writing made in paper or parchment,
wherein are contained and described contracts, covenants, last wills, or other
facces and things of persons for the testimony or memory thereof.

And first we say it is a formal writing to distinguish Instruments from
ordinary letters, private notes, reckonings, and remembrances made by any for
a man's own private use or memory, and from all books of arts, histories,
divinity, philosophy, and such like.

Secondly, made upon paper or parchment, for that, that before the invention of
Paper or Parchment men used to write sometimes upon bords rubbed over with
ware, sometimes upon stones, sometimes upon metal, and sometimes upon the
inner rinds of the barks of trees. And sometimes at this day upon tables,
stones, or tallies, none of all which kinds of writings we here mean, but
such only as are made upon paper or parchment.

Thirdly, in saying that an Instrument co^prehendeth things contracted: it
sets before our eyes, what the very matters, business and acts be, whereof
such Instruments must be made: namely of agreements and co^tracts, grants,
wills, pleadings etc. which may breed Obligations, and not of bare speeches,
communications, or private notes.

Fourthly, the word (persons) points to the efficient cause of these
Covenants and Contracts.

Fifthly, that which ensues teaches us the very final cause why such
Instruments were first ordained, that is, to the end the acts and things
therein comprised might both more certainly be kept in memory, and more easily
to be proved: for the proof of the Instruments only proves the Contracts
therein contained. And therefore Instruments are a kind of proof in all laws.

The form of Instruments does plainly appear at full in the description of
Instruments thoroughout the second Book, in which you may see the manner,
form, and fashion of every kind of Instrument extraiudiciall.

Of the distribution of Instruments.
INstruments therefore of their effects be either constitutiue and Sect. 46.
making, or remissorie and liberatorie.

An Instrument constitutiue is such an Instrument under the proper hand of the
party as testifies and describes some contract of some debt or duty to be
paid, or some fact to be done or performed, as an obligation, bill of debt etc.

And of Instruments constitutiue, some are creating, and some conueying.

A constitutiue Instrument creating, be those whereby any estate, property,
power, or obligation, not having any essence or being before, is newly raised
and created, as the first grant of a rent, common, way etc. estate tail, for
life, years, and such like, Warrants of Attorney, Commissions etc.

Instruments constitutiue conueying, are those by which estates, properties, or
powers, being already created are transferred and conveyed to others, As
Instruments of feoffements, bargains and sales, assignements, and graunts
over, or surrenders, confirmations, substitutions and deputations etc. by
which, estates, properties and authorities are conveyed over to others.

And an Instrument remissarie, is an Instrument under the parties hand
describing and testifying some precedent contract of a debt, duty or fact to
be paid, performed, done, released, or discharged: of which sort, be all
acquitances, releases, and other matters of discharge.

Secondly, of the efficient cause, Instruments be either public or private.

A public Instrument, is an Instrument made by public authority of a
Magistrate or Judge, as all grants and charters of the Q. Majesty under her
highness great seal, or under the seal of the Duchy, or of any of her highness
Courts of Record, and all deeds and charters knowledged and enrolled in any of
her Majesty's courts of record.

Such public Instruments of their own natures prove the facts or contracts
therein contained, and are of such and so great credit of their own natures,
that they themselves need no proof at all.

Private Instruments, are Instruments made between private persons, by the
private authority of the contractors themselves only without public
authority, wherefore although they being proved by witnesses, or otherwise do
prove the contracts and facts of the parties therein mentioned: yet of
themselves without such proof, they prove nothing, as deeds of feoffement,
obligations, acquitances, wills etc.

Thirdly, Instruments be either of such persons as have natural capacity by
birth, which every liege subject being borne within her Majesty's dominion
has by his nativity.

Or by making, as every stranger borne has, being by act of Parliament
naturalized, or made a Denizen.

Or else of such as have only civil capacity, as of all corporations or civil
bodies, and lawful societies, colleges, guilds, fraternities, fellowships, and
companies incorporate, as Majors, and communalties, bailifes, and burgesses,
deans and chapters, Bishops, Parsons, Vicars, etc. and al such as have
succession perpetual, and take to them and their successors.

Fourthly instruments be either sealed and delivered, or not sealed and
delivered.

Fifthly of their form also, Instruments be either polled, and single, or
indented.

A polled deed, is a deed testifying, that only the one of the parties to the
same has put his seal thereunto, after the manner following: Sciant p^sentes
and futuri quod ego W. W. de R. in com^ C. generosus, dedi, concessi, and hac
praesenti charta mea confirm^ T. D. de S. in eode^ com^ ar^, vnum mesuag', and
xx. acras ter^ cu^ pertin^ in R. p^d in praed' com^ C. Habend and tenend' ten^
p^d, cu^ pertin^ praef. T. D. haered', and assign^ suis im perpet^, ad solum,
proprium opus and vsum eiusdem T. D. haered', and assignat^ suor^ imperpet^.
Tenend' de capital' Dn^is feod' illius per seruitia inde prius debita, and de
iure consuet^. Et ego vero praefat^ W. W. and haeredes mei ten^ praed' cum
pertin^ praefat^ T. D. haered' and assignat^ suis contra omnes homines
warrantizabimus, and imperpetuu^ defendemus per praesentes. In cuius rei
testimonium huic praesenti chartae meae sigillum meum apposui, datum 30. die
Martij, Ann. regni Dominae nostrae Eliz. Dei gratia Angliae Franciae, and
Hibern^ Reginae, fidei defensoris, etc. 36. Anno Dom. 1594.

These deeds polled, are also termed Chartae priuatae and simplices, because
there is only one part thereof which ought to remain with the grantee, donee,
feoffee, leassee, etc.

And poll deeds may begin thus. Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos praesentes
literae peruenerint W. W. etc. salutem in Dn^o sempiternam. Sciatis me
praesatum W. W. etc. Or thus, Pateat vniuersis per praesentes me W. W. dedisse
etc. Or thus, Omnibus Christi fidelibus praesentes literas inspecturis.

Or thus by a Nobleman, placing his name with all his titles of honor at the
beginning thereof. Praenobilis Gilbertus Com^ Salop^, dn^s Furniual verdon and
Strange de Blackmere Dominus Luftoft, nobilis equestris ordinis Garterij
sodalis Regiaeque Maiestati a sacris co^silijs etc. salutem etc. Sciatis me
p^fat^ Comitem, etc. and the like of others, etc. Or thus, Christianis universe.
praes. scriptum inspecturis sieve auditur^, etc. Or thus, Haec billa testat^,
quod etc.

Or thus by a Corporation, Nouerint vniuersi per praesentes nos R. I. Maiorem
burgi de Donc, and Co^munitatem eiusdem burgi ex vnanimi nostr consensu and
assensu, dedisse, etc.

Or by the Queen, or by any other king or Prince thus, Elizabeth dei gratia
Angliae, Fra^ciae, and Hibern^ Reg. fidei defensor etc. Omnibus ad quos p^sent^
liter^ nostr^ peruen^ salutem, Sciatis nos, or sciatis quod nos etc. Or thus,
Elizabeth etc. Archiepisc. Episc. Ducibus, Comitibus, Baronibus, Militibus etc.
Sciatis quod nos, etc. Or thus, Reg. universe. and singulis Iusticiarijs, and
Custod' forestar^, Maioribus, Coronatoribus, Eschaetor^, Vicecom^, Forestarijs,
custodibus pacis, venditoribus victual' and cariag', ac omnium aliarum rerum
quarumcunque pro expensis hospicij nostri, Constabular^, Balliuis, Officiar^,
Ministris, and omnibus subditis nostris quibuscunque, tam infra libertatem quam
extra, ad quos etc. Sciatis etc.

And in many other like forms according to the quality of the person, to whom
her highness Patents are directed. In which who so desires to be further
instructed, may plentifully be satisfied by pervsing of the Register, etc.

And the sealing of the Queens letters P. are commonly concluded with these or
the like words, (viz.) In cuius rei testimonium has literas nostras fieri
fecimus pate^tes. Test meipsa apud W. 3. die Maij, Anno regni nostri 36:

And the ensealing of a deed by a corporation thus: In cuius rei testimonium
sigillum nostrum commune praesentibus apposuimus. Datum in Guilhalda Burgi
praedicti etc.

Of deeds indented.
A Deed inde^ted is a deed consisting of two parts or more, in which Sect. 47.
it is expressed, that the parties to the same deed, have to every part
thereof interchangeably, or severally set their several Seals, And they are
most commonly made in this form. (viz.)

Haec Indentura facta inter A. B. de C. in comitatu Ebor^ H. ex vna part, and
E. F. de G. in comitatu H. Y. ex altera part, Testatur quod praed' A. B.
dedit, co^cessit, and hac p^senti charta indentata confirmauit praefato E. F.
and haered' suis xx. acr^ terr^ etc. Habend' etc. In cuius rei testimoniu^
parts praed' sigill' sua praesentibus alternatim apposueru^t. Datum, etc. Or
thus. In cui^s rei testm^ vni parti huius praesentis Indentur^ penes praesatu^
E. F. reman^ paed' A. B. sigillu^ suum apposuit, alteri vero parti eiusdem
Indenturae penes praefatum A. B. remanent^ praefat^ E. F. sigill' suum
apposuit, Dat^ xx. die lan. Anno etc.

Or the date thereof may be put in the beginning of the deed thus. Haec
Indentura facta xx. die lan. anno regni etc. Inter A. B. etc. and C. D. etc.
Testatur etc. These deeds indented, or Indentures and deeds Poll, may be made
in the first person also, but are most usually made in the third person. And in
the first person be of this form, Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos hoc
praesens scriptum, Or praesens charta, Or praesentes literae indentatae
peruenetint, A, de B. etc. salutem in Domin^ sempiternam etc. Sciatis me praef.
A. B. dedisse, concessisse, and hac p^senti chart^ mea indent^ confirmasse C.
D. etc. xx. acras terr^ etc. Habend' and tene^d' etc. vel sic, Sciant
praesentes and futuri etc. vel Nouerint vniuersi per p^sentes etc. vel Pateat
vniuersis etc. qued ego A. B. de etc. dedi, concessi, and hoc praeie^ti scripto
meo indentato confirmaui C. D. xx. acras te^rae etc. Habend' etc. In cuius rei
testimon^ tam ego praef. A. B qua^ p^fat^ C. D. his Indenturis sigilla nostra
alternatim apposuimus, Datum etc. vel sic, In cuius rei testimoniu^ vni parti
huius praesentis Indentur^ sigillum meu^ apposui, alteri vero parti eiusde^
Indenturae praefatus C. D. sigillum suum apposuit, Datum, etc.

And both parts of such deeds Indented be the deeds of both the parties to
the same: And every part of such Indentures is the deed of either of the said
parties, and each part is of as much force and effect alone, and as beneficial
to either of the said parties, as both parts thereof together.

These deeds indented are not only bypartite as these above mentioned, but
also may be made tripartie, that is of three parts, or quadrupartite,
quinquepartite, or of as many parts as shall be needful in form abouesaid,
Mutatis mutandis etc. as by sundry examples in this preseut discourse may
appear.

And these deeds indended or Indentures are most commonly indented or cut one
of them into another. But the cutting of them in that manner only does not
suffice to make them deeds indented, nor the calling of them so by the
parties, if the putting too of the seals, in form abouesaid be not therein
expressed. Thus much generally for the several forms of deeds.

Observations necessary for the making of Instruments.
IN the form of every Instrument it seems needful to consider Sect. 48.
the substance thereof, and of the adjuncts. Touching the substance, a deed
does consist of two principal parts, namely the premises and consequence
thereof.

The premises of an Instrument is the former part thereof, and is commonly
said to be all that which preceadeth the Habendum or limitation of the estate.

In the premises of Instruments are principally to be considered three things.

The first, the person contracting, next the thing, matter, or fact whereof
the contract is to be made, and then the words with which the said contract is
to be described.

The persons are the very efficient causes of the Instruments, by whose consent
they are agreed upon and made.

And the persons to Instruments be either active or passive.

The active person in Instruments is he which makes the Instruments, or which
gives, feoffeth, releaseth, confirms, grants, seals, lends,
delivers, lets, departs with, couenauteth, or promises any thing: or
shortly he which makes any contract or bargain, to, or with any other, and
is named according to the contract: As the donor, feoffor, lessor, obligor,
releasor, grantor, confirmor, seller, lender, bargainer, etc.

The passive person in Instruments, is he, unto whom the Instruments be made,
and which takes thereby, who is likewise diversely named, according to the
several natures of the contracts, to or with them made.

In the persons 2. things are to be heeded: The capacities: and nams.

Touching capacity, consideration is to be had, that the active persons which
should make any deeds be persons able to do it: namely, that they be void of
all impediments, either natural or civil: of which we have entreated before
amongst contracts.

And the passive persons be such as be capable of things which should be
given or transferred unto them, and void of the like impediments, and not dead
persons in law, as Monks, Friars, Nuns, and such superstitious votaries.

Of the names and Additions of persons.
ANd touching the names or Additions of the parties to Instruments, Sect. 49.
it is requisite, y^ they be certainly named by their names of baptism and
surnames, with a lawful and sufficient additions of place, estate, degree,
mystery, or occupation, to distinguish them from all other persons of like
name, whether such person be King, Prince, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Vicount,
Baron or Lord, which be names of great Nobility and honor: Or he be a Knight,
Esquire, or Gen(...), which for difference are termed names of less Nobility
or honor: Or he be a ye oman, husbandman, artificer, or laborer: Or else if it
be any Ecclesiastical person, as Archbishop, Bishop, Archdeaco^, Deane,
Parson, Vicar, Clerk, etc. Or if it be any Corporation, or body civil or
politic, having Covent and common seal, as Bailife, and Burgesses, Mayor and
Communaltie, or other brotherhood, etc. And for the anoyding if confusion and
error, thus: Sciant etc. quod ego W. W. de R. in com^ E. gen^, dedi, etc. T. N.
de R. in eodem comitatu Tailor etc. and such like.

Of the matters and things or facts whereof Instruments be made.
ANd as concerning the matters, things and facts whereof Instruments Sect. 50.
are to be described, are also to be considered 2. things: First the things or
facts themselves, and then their necessary circumstances.

And as for the things themselves, it is to be weighed, whether the very bodies
of the things themselves be to be co^tracted for, as lands or goods etc. or the
rights pertaining to the persons in the use of y^ bodies of things: as wares,
use, fruits, and profits, which we take thereby. And in things is to be noted
whether they be corporal or incorporal.

Corporal things are such as of their own nature may be felt or seen, and
they be either moveable or immovable. Things moveable are those which may be
removed out of one place into another: as garments, fruits of the earth,
beasts, rents, etc.

Things immovable be such things as cannot be removed from place to place,
which be therefore called things of the soil or ground, as the very groci^^ it
self, and things fixed to the same, which cannot be removed without the
destruction thereof, as trees planted therein, houses thereupon builded, etc.

Things incorporal be such as by their own nature can neither be seen nor
fealt, and are comprehended only by understanding, and therefore can neither be
(...) nor divided, as property, possession, inheritance, service, aduowsons of
Churches, wardships, the use and fruitio^ of things civil, obligations,
contracts, alienations, and at a word all rights as well to have the very things
themselves, or the use thereof: as liberty to go through another man's soil,
common of pasture, way, liberty to hawke, hunt, or fi^h, etc. notwithstanding
that the subjects whereunto they be annexed are corporale as the so^^^
incorporall, yet the right to enjoy or inherit the same incorporall.

Which things being thoroughly surueied, the writer must have special regard,
what manner of thing is to be contracted for ^ whether it be honor, castle,
manor, house, land, meadow, pasture, farm, parsonage, aduowson, office, park,
pond, warren (...) wardships, marriages, ways, common, or other things
whatsoever, setting them down by their apt and usual names, if they have any,
or by such other accidents and circumstances, as may certainly describs, and
distinguish them from all other, as the Town, Hamlet, and County where the
thing lies, hutting it at thendes, and binding^t at the sides (if need be)
and expressing in whose occupation it is be has bin, who was thauncient, owner
thereof etc. As vnum masi^^^ cum pertin^ in S. in com^ C. vocat^ Cowhal iacen^
inter ten^t^ I. S. ex pte Boreali, and ten^tu^ T. S. ex part australi, and
abuttat ad orient^ caput su per ten^tum D. D. and ad occident^ caput su per
ten^tu^ L. T. que nu per perquisnui mihi, and hered' meis de N. N. and nu^c
sunt vel nu per fuor^ in occupatione S. T. vel assignator^ suoru^ etc.
expressing all things certainly with apt significant wards, and therein
eschewing all Metaphorical, figurati^e, and borrowed speeches, and all words of
diverse or doubtful significations.

What words are to be used in the making of Instruments.
SVch words must be used in every Instrument, as the nature of the Sect. 51.
contract does require: As in Feoffements, feoffe (...) or co^^cessi, etc. In a
Release, Romisi, or (...) Confirmaui, Ratificani, etc. In bargain and sale,
Bargainani and vendidi etc. So of other in the premises, and like, with such
words as be requisite, and are expressed in the other parts of deeds.

Of the consequence of Deeds.
THus much touching the premises or first part of Instruments, Sect. 52.
Now let us enter into consideration of the subsequence or sequel thereof. The
latter part of Instruments, and consequence thereof is all that necessarily
follows the premises, and that is the Habendum, in which is limited and
^^^^^essed what estate or property the party passive shall have: as f^e*
sail, etc.

And that is two fold, namely the limitation of the state and of (...).

The limitation of the estate is to limit and express in certain, what estate
the party shall have in the thing contracted.

The limitation of thuse is to express in the said Habend, to or for whose use
and benefit he shall have the same estate, r^^iting with all the thing granted
by some sufficient general name: as H^be^d and teneodi praed' maner^ imperpet^
(if a man^ ^ be granted (...) the premises) p^d mesuag' cum pertin^ or ten^ta
praed' cum pertin^, as the case requires p^f. I. S. and haered' and assign^
suis imperpet^, ad opus and vsum praed' I. S. haered' and assignator^ snor^
imperpet^.

Of the adjuncts or acci^dents of Instruments.
THus are the essential parts of Instruments discussed, The adjuncts Sect. 53.
now come in place.

Wherein are all those things which come to the Instruments beside the
essential parts thereof, which likewise be of two sorts: for either they be
adjuncts common to either of the said parties, or proper to the one part only.

Adjuncts common are two, the date of deeds, and the consideration of the
contract.

Of the date of deeds.
THe date is the description of the time in which ye deed was made Sect. 54.
which is done either by y^ year of our L. or y^ year of the Princes reign, and
it ought either to be placed in y^ beginning of the premises, or in the end of
consequence, of which see examples thereof ensuing.

Of the cause of considerations of deeds.
THe considerations of Instruments is the motive cause, for which Sect. 55.
the Instruments are made, as money or other goods, affection natural or such
like, which is most commonly, and in my conceit most ap^ly expressed in the
premises, and which nevertheless may be put in the consequence, and in many
cases be omitted. Of both examples hereof are many in the second book.

Of Adjuncts proper to the consequence of Instruments.
A Diuncts of y^ consequence of Instruments are such as are most Sect. 56.
commonly set down after y^ Habend'. And they be of diverse sorts.

As the reseruatio^, Reddend', if any rent, suit or service be reserved.

The reenere.

The nomine penae.

The clause of distress.

The tenend' showing ye land is holden touching things inheritable.

The clause of warranty general or special or particular.

The exceptions out of whole things.

The conditions and prouisoes.

All covenants are to be made of either side according to every several
contract.

As to be saved harmeles or discharged, to be ^^ised in fe^ etc.

To have power to sell.

To be owner of the tenements or chattelsfold.

To make further assurance.

To be seized to the alieuees use.

For quiet inioying etc.

And every other necessary covenant according to the nature and quality of the
thing or fact, whereof the contract is made, and the manner of the contracts
made. Regarding heedfully all circumstances of the place, person, occasion,
thing, manner of doing, cause, exception, condition, according to the true
meaning and agreement of the parties curiously without prejudice, parciality or
favor to either of them.

Then follows the drawing of such Instruments in form after some president
ensuing, as the quality of the fact or contract exacteth: whether it be a
feoffement, grant, release etc. or any other Instrument.

Then must such first draught be circumspectly examined, perused, concluded and
agreed upon by the parties or their counsel.

When such draught is so agreed upon, then it is to be fair written and
engrossed in paper or parchment, without blotting, rasing, enterlining, writing
every word plainly at length, without any abbreuiations, ciphers, signs, or
notes, which may breed any scruple or doubt.

Then must they be warily and precisely read over, and examined twice or thrice
at the least, lest any thing be inserted, detracted, omitted, altered or
mistaken, differing from the parties good meaning.

For Instruments once sealed and delivered, may be altered or amended in
nothing.

All things being thus dispatched, the Instruments are to be subscribed by
the parties.

And by them sealed with hard ware like to continue long.

And when Instruments are sealed and subscribed, they must be openly read and
published in the hearing of diverse substantial credible witnesses, and
afterward delivered in their presence, as the acts and deeds of the parties.

These things so finished, the sealing and delivery of such deeds must be
certified upon the back side thereof, or in some other convenient place
thereof, thus: Sealed and delivered in the presence of A. B. C. D. E. F. etc.
And choose always such young witnesses which can subscribe their own names if
you can getthem.

Deeds in old time were wont to be delivered in the presence of men of greatest
credit and worship that could be gotten. And many times in open Courts, or
great ^^^emblies of people for credit and proof.

The end of the first Book.
The first part of Symboleography containing Instruments Extraiudicial,
Agreements, Coue nants, Contracts, Grants, etc.
ALthough by order we learn how to do things, and then put the same in
practice, yet the very actions themselves are worthily deemed far more
excellent and honorable then the bare knowledge thereof: by so much as the end
is more precious then all the means by which the same is attained.

For as in Schools in vain should children spend their time in learning the
rules of Grammar, touching either the Etimology or Syntaxis thereof, if they
did not after apply their knowledge to the use of speaking and writing.

And as Physicians should unprofitably store themselves with the understanding
of the several natures and properties of herbs and roots, and other simples,
or of the Art of Physic, if they did not show us, the use and fruit thereof
in curing diseases, and restoring health: So doubtless the doctrine of all other
Arts and Sciences, is idle and barren if use and practice be not therewith
conjoined. And therefore we always account those things which are wrought by
art, of far more passing excellency then we do the Art it self.

Neither does any doubt that it is harder to practice an Art, then only to
learn the Theorike part thereof: For neither they which know the several
kinds and measures of verses, with the laws of versifying, are thereby
straight ways Poets: Nor they which have learned by heart all the tropes figures
and precepts of Rhetorike, are by and by Orators: for to their knowledge they
must needs couple long use and exercise before they win the names of perfect
Poets, or eloquent Orators.

Even so, it suffices not for a notarie to know only what Instruments and
contracts be, what things and acts they may be made of, and by what persons,
with such other general notio^s. For ere he be worthy that name, he must
thoroughly know the several tenors and forms of every special instrument, in
each kind of contract and business.

Wherefore as heretofore I have generally in some measure laid down the
doctrine of Instruments: so in these which follow, I intend to show certain
forms of cuerie kind of Instruments, as they have heretofore long time been
used, and approved by learned men of great experience: from whose sound
examples therein, I think it not good rashly to swerve, because it is a far
suerer course, to retain those certain forms which continually have bin many
years put in ure, then to devise new: For that, time, who is the touchstone of
all Arts, has confirmed these.

SYMBOLEOGRAPHY. Of Covenants, Articles, Promises, Contracts, and Agreements
etc.
ANd for so much as Covenants are inserted Sect. 57.
into all manner of instruments, I think it good first to show examples
thereof having defined what manner of instruments they be: an Instrument of
Covenants therefore is a formal deed containing an agreement of diverse
persons, whereby the one does promise or covenant with the other to do or omit
some act or acts, thing or things in such sort as they have concluded thereof
amongst themselves, and they are most commonly made with these words following,
or the like in effect.

The words wherewith covenants be made or written.
THis Indenture made etc. between A. B. of C. etc. on the one party, Sect. 58.
and C. D. of etc. on the other party, Witnesses that the said A. B. for

them and every of them, that if it happen etc.

Covenants between Executors where the one grants the goods to the other
being bound to perform the will.
THis Indenture made etc. between R. S. and H. M. etc. Witnesses Sect 59.
that whereas T. S. now deceased late brother of the said R in his life time
did make his last will and testament in writing, and therein made and ordained
the said R. and I. then wife of the said T. and now wife of the said H.
executors thereof, as by the said testament and last will appears. And where
also the said H. and I. have and enjoy not only all such goods and chattels
which the said T. did give and bequeath unto the said I. but also all plate,
money, and all other goods and chattels which were of the said T. S. at the

etc. to and with the said R. S. his executors and administrators and every of
them by these presents, that he the said H. and I. his wife, or one of them, or
yt executors, administrators or assigns of them, or of one of them, shall and
will content and pay or cause to be paid unto the said R. S. his executors, or
administrators, or to the executors of the suruiuor of the said executors
forty pou^ds of etc. within 6. months next after the full age of G. and H. S.
sons of the said T. S. or of either of them if they or either of them shall
so long live, or else within one year next after the decease of the suruiuour
of them the said G. and H. if both the said G. and H. S. shall die before
either of them shall come to, and be of his said full age. Provided always and
the said H. M. for him etc. does covenant etc. that if the same I. now wife of
the said H. M. shall depart this present life before the said G. and H. S. or
either of them shall come and be of his said full age, and the said G. and H.
S. or either of them suruiuing the said I. That then the said H. M. his heirs
etc. shall content and pay, or cause to be contented and paid unto y^ said R.
S. his executors or administrators or to the executors of the suruiuor of the
executors of the same R. S. the sum of xx. l. etc. within one year next after
such decease of the same I. And over this the said H. M. for him etc. does
covenant etc. that he the said H. M. and I. his wife and their exe^^, adm^ and
assigns, and every of them, of his, her, and their proper costs and charges,
during the marriage betwixt him the said H. and the said I. shall well and
sufficiently sustain, and maintain the houses and buildings which be set and
builded upon such customary lands and tenements in W. in the said county of N.
which the said H. M. and I. in the right of the said I. now have and do hold
for term of life of y^ said I. And that he the said H. M. and I. nor either of
them shall do no manner of wast in or upon the said customarie lands and
tenements, or any parcel thereof. And also where the said H. M. together with
I. B. of S. and I. D. of W. by their writing obligatory do standiointly and
severally bound unto the said R. S. in one hundred pounds of good etc. with and
upon condition thereupon indorsed for the true performance of the covenants,
grants, paiments, and agreements contained in these present Indentures on the
part of the said H. M. his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, or
any of them to be performed, paid, or kept, as by the said writing
obligatorie, and condition aforesaid more plainly it does and may appear: The
said H. M. for him etc. does covenant etc. to and with the said R. S. etc. that
if an^e two of the persons bound in or by the said writing obligatory, or any
two of any other persons hereafter to be bound, in, or by any other writing
obligatorie to be made for the same purpose, shall die and depart this present
life before all the covenants, graunts, articles, payments, and agreements, in
these present Indentnres contained, shall be well and truly performed and kept,
that then the suruiuor of the persons bound by any such writing obligatorie
shall with two other sufficient suerties within two years next after such
departure or death as is last aforesaid, by their sufficient and lawful
writing obligatorie become jointly and severally bound to the said R. S. his
executors or administrators, or to y^ executors of the suruiuor of the
executors of the said R. S. in the sum of etc. with and upon condition in
effect as is aforesaid, and so often to find and lay in such bonds with such
sureties as is aforesaid, as any such death or deaths, as is aforesaid, shall
happen, as is before declared, during the said time. And over this the said R.
S. for him, etc. does covenant to and with the said H. M. etc. that he the said
R. S. his etc. shall acquit, discharge, and from time to time for ever save
harmless the said H. M. and I his wife, and either of them, and all the
executors, administrators, and assigns of them and either of them against the
said G. C. and H. S. and either of them of all and singular legacies, gifts,
and bequests which the said T. their father did by his last will and testament
give and bequeath to the same G. C. and H. S. and either of them. In witness
whereof etc.

Covenants to discharge Executors and procure release.
THis Inde^ture made etc. Between I. S. on the one party, and C. B. Sect. 61.
late wife of T. B. deceased, and executeir of the last will and testament of
the same R. B. of the other party, Witnesses. That where the said R. B. was in
his life time put in trust, as one of the feoffees of I. S. esquire deceased,
to levy and receive the profit of certain lands and tenements to the same
feoffees assured, for certain sums of money, to the use, and for the

Statutes and Statutes Merchant.
A Statute is a bond of Record sealed, testifiing Sect. 105.
the debtor to owe unto the creditor a certain sum of money. And the same bond
is knowledged before such persons, and in such manner as is appointed by
Statutes in that behalf made. And thereof bin such bonds termed Statutes, and
they be of two sorts: that is to say, Statutes Merchant, and Statutes Staple. A
Statute Merchant is a bond knowledged before one of the Clerks of the
Statutes Merchant and Mayor or chief Wardein of the City of London, or two
Merchants of the said City for that purpose assigned, or before the Mayor,
chief Warden or Master of other Cities or good Towns, or other sufficient men
for that purpose appointed. And sealed with the seal of the debtor, and of the
King, which is of two pieces, the greater is kept by the said Mayor, chief
Warden etc. and the lesser piece thereof by the said Clarks. The fee for the
said Seal is for Statutes knowledged in Fayres of every pound an halfepeny,
and out of Fayres of every pound a farthing. The execucion upon Statutes
Merchant is first to take the body of the debtor, if he be lay, and can be
found, if otherwise, then upon his lands and goods. 13. Ed. 1. cap. And it is
made in form following.

Statutes Staple.
A Statute Staple is either properly so called or improperly: Sect. 107.
A Statute staple properly so called is a bond of Record knowledged before the
Mayor of the Staple in the presence of one of the two Constables of the same
Staple, for which seal the fee is of every pound, if the sum exceed not a
C. li. a half penny. And if it exceed a C. li. of every pound a farthing. And
by virtue of such a statute Staple, the creditor may forthwith after
certificate thereof into the Chancerie have execution of the body, lands and
goods of the debtor 17. E. 3. cap. 9. And the statute Staple properly so called
is made as follows.

A statute Staple for debt.
NOuerint vniuersi per praesentes me I. H. de L. in com^ Sussex Sect. 108.

merchandizis in eade^ emptis recuperand', ordinat^ and prouis. Dat^ vndecimo
die Feb. anno regni dn^ae nostrae Eliz. dei gratia etc.

Note, that if any statute Merchant, or of the Staple, within 4. Months after
the knowledging thereof, be not brought to the Clark of Recognizances taken
according to the statute of 23. H. 8. cap. 6. or his deputy, and the true
copy thereof there entered in the book of the said office, within vi. Months
after the said knowledging thereof, then is the same thereby void against
purchasers of lands, which otherwise should be thereunto liable, 27. Eliz.
cap. 4.

Of a bond improperly called a Statute staple.
A Statute staple improper is a bond of Record founded upon Sect. 109.
the statute of 23. H. 8. ca. 6. of the nature of a proper statute staple, as
touching the force and execution thereof, and knowledged before one of the
chief Justices, and in their absence before the Mayor of the Staple, and the
Recorder of London, in this manner.

Nouerint vniuersi per praesentes nos A. B. and C. D. armig', teneri and

Conditions of Obligations and Recognizances.
HItherto have we showed the several forms of Obligations, Sect. 110.
Recognizances, and Statutes. And now for so much as there be sundry Conditions
and Defeasances made to defeat the same: It seems meet in this place to show
the forms of so many of them as seem necessary for our instruction in the
making thereof, leaving the rest which be almost infinite to be made, as
occasion shall be offered.

A Condition, Conditio, is therefore generally a rule, manner, or law, annexed
unto men's acts, staying and suspending the same, and making it uncertain
whether they shall be or no: For a Condition is properly said to be, when any
thing is referred to an incertaine chance which may happen, or not happen. But
we omitting curiously to search out the diverse significations and manifold
divisions thereof, will in this place only touch some such Conditions as may
concern Obligations and recognizances. A condition of an Obligation or
Recognizance is such an agreement of both the parties to the same as stays
and delayeth theffect thereof, until the condition happen to be fulfilled, and
is of sundry forms. But first we will handle such as concern payment of
money, or delivery of goods, or other things.

A Condition to pay a sum of money at a certain day.
THe condition of this Obligation is such, that if the within bounden Sect. 111.
A. B. his h^irs, executors, or administrators, or any of them, do well and
truly pay, or cause to be paid unto the within named C. D. or his certain
Attorney, executors or administrators, or some of them x. li. of lawful
English money upon the first day of October next ensuing the date hereof, at,
or in the South porch of the parish Church of R. in the said county of Y.
That then this present Obligation to be utterly void and of none effect, or
else to stand, remain and be of full force, strength, power and virtue.

Note that such Conditions as be subscribed or written under the Obligations
upon the same side of the parchment or paper that the obligation be written
upon, are commonly called conditions, but such as be indorsed or written on
the other side thereof are called indorsements: and then is the same made in
this sort.

THe Condition of the within written obligation is such, that if y^ within
bounden A. B. etc. to the within named C. D. etc. as next above.

A Condition of a Recognisance for the payment of money at two days.
THe Condition of this Recognisance is such, that if the above Sect. 112.
bounden H. G. his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns or any of them,
do well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the above named W. C. his
executors or assigns or any of them, at, or within the mesuage or mansion
house commonly called N. the place wherein M. A. widow now dwells, situate
and being in Saint Martins le grand within the city of London the sum of x.
li. of lawful English money in manner and form following: That is to say, on
the x. day of N. next coming after the date above written, at the place
aforesaid, between the hours of eight of the clock of the forenoone of the
same day, and five of the clock of the afternoon of the same day, v. li. of
lawful English money, and in the tenth day of February then next following,
at the place aforesaid, and between the hours aforesaid other v. li. That
then this Recognisance to be void and of none effect. And if default be made in
payment of the same x. li. or any part thereof, contrary to the order and form
aforesaid, Then this present Recognisance to stand, remain, continue and be
in full force, strength and virtue.

A Condition to pay money and deliver wool,
THe Condition etc. that if the within bounden R. S. his etc. do well Sect. 113.
and truly content and pay, or cause etc. unto the within named R. G. at etc.

truly deliver or cause to be delivered unto the said R. etc. at the place
aforesaid, on this side the said feast of etc. or within four days next
ensuing after the said feast xl. stone of good, marchantable and perfect fleece
woll without tar or locks, being well, clean, and sufficiently washed and
perfectly dried, That then etc.

A Condition for the farm of Kine, and redeliuerie of them or money.
THe Condition etc. That where the within named A. C. has Sect. 114.
letten to farm to the within bounden C. B. three milch Kine for the term of
seven years next ensuing after the feast of etc. if the said C. B. his heirs,
executors or administrators, do well and truly content and pay, or cause to be

of good English money yearly, and every year during the said term, for the
farm of the said iii. milch Kine. And also in the end of the said term, do

executors or assigns, three good and able milch kine, or else the sum of etc.
for and in consideration of the said three milch kine so demised, at the
election of the said A. C. his executors or assigns, That then etc.

A Condition to redeliuer sheep or money, and the farm.
THe Condition of this obligation is such, that where the within Sect. 115.
named T. W. has letten to farm, and delivered into the hands and possession

Feoffements seem by good right worthy to be next placed.

Feoffements.
Of Feoffements, and what a Feoffement is.
A Feoffement, Feoffamentum, or rather Feufamentum, for it Sect. 235.
seems to be derived of Feudum, a Gottish word, so called a fide vel
fidelitate, which is defined of the Civil Lawiers, A loving and free grant of
a thing either immovable, or of like nature, by transferring of the use and
profit thereof, retayning the very property under the doing of Fealty, and
other services. And of some it is said to be a kind of protection or patronage,
safeguard, or homage, whereby some dignity, pension, or ground, is in such
manner given or granted to any man, that he and his heirs and posterity
should for ever acknowledge the aucthor of the same good turn, and worship
him as their Patron or Lord, and defend his person, honor, lands, and goods
etc. By which I gather, that Feoffamentum generally signifies donationem
feudi. But with us it is properly any gift or grant of any honors, castles,
manors, mesuages, lands, or other corporal immovable things of like nature,
to another and his heirs for ever, by the delivery of seisin and possession
of the thing given, whether the gift be made by word or writing. And when it is
by writing, it is called a deed of Feoffement. And in every Feoffement the
giver is called the feoffor, feoffator: and he that receives by virtue
thereof the feoffee, feoffatus. As in these examples following.

Liuerie of seisin.
ALbeit deeds of Feoffement thus made be sealed and delivered Sect. 251.
by the feoffor unto the feoffee, and openly read, yet the things in such
Charters contained pass not without livery of possession and seisin, Litt^
Sect' 59. and 60. For no feoffement can be made without Liuerie of seisin. It
is meet therefore I should show what Liuerie of seisin is, and to what end it
was invented, and how it ought to be made. It is termed in Latin, Traditio
possessionis, Inuestitura, vulgo deliberatio seisinae, which is nothing else,
but datio possessionis, for Tradere non significat rei proprietatem da^e, sed
rem ipsam accipienti porrigere eiusue possessionem ad illum transfer.
Wherefore we may well define Liuerie of seisin to be a Ceremony in our Law,
used in the conueying of lands or tenements, or other things corporal (for of
things incorporall no Liuerie of seisin may be) by feoffeme^t from one man to
another, in fee simple, fee tail, or for the term of life, as an argument or
token of the willingness of the feoffor to depart with, and of the feoffee to
receive the thing whereof the feoffement is made. Which was ordained at the
first, that the common people might thereby have notice of thalteration of such
estates, and so better know in whom the right thereof remained, for their
common quiet and repose. Perkins 209. 210. Bracton Lib. 2: cap. 18. Sect'. 1.
2. The usual manner of delivery of seisin of houses, lands or tenements is,
that the feoffor and feoffee if they be present, or in their absence, their
Procurators or Atturnies (by sufficient warrants of attorney in writing) do
come to the house or place whereof seisin is to be delivered: And there in the
presence of sundry good witnesses openly read, or cause to be read, the deed
of feoffement and letter of Attorney thereof, or to declare the very effect
thereof before them in English. Which being so done, the feoffor or, his
Attorney must take a clot of earth, or a bough, or a twig of a tree thereupon
growing, or the ring or haspe of the door of the house, and deliver the same
with the said deed unto the feoffee or his Attorney, saying: I deliver these
unto you in name of possession and seisin of all the lands and tenements
contained in this deed, to have and to hold according to the form and effect
of the same deed.

If the feoffement be without deed (as it may well be) then at the time of the
delivery of seisin, must be expressed the very estate which the feoffee must
have thereby. In delivery of Seisin, all persons having any lawful possession
or seisin in the thing of which seisin is to be delivered, ought either to
join together in the making of the Liuerie of seisin, or to be removed thence,
as lessees for years, or for life: for every Liuerie ought to bring an
immediate possession unto the feoffee, Littleton Sect' 61. and 418. Also if the
feoffement be of diverse parcels of lands lying in several Towns in one
County, Liuerie of seisin in any part thereof suffiseth for all, if they be
then in the feoffors possession and out of lease. But if they be in diverse
Counties, or in lease, or out of his possession, it is convenient that he
enter into every parcel thereof and make Liuerie of seisin in every several
parcel thereof, for he can give no possession unto his feoffee if he have it
not in himself at the very instant of the delivery of seisin made, Littlet^
cap. 18. Sect' 1. And Bracton says, Non iaceb^t seisina aliquo tempore medio
vacua. By Liuerie of seisin the feoffor transferreth unto the feoffee all that
he has in the things whereof the Liuerie is made, according to the state
thereupon limited. If two several deeds of feoffement be made to two several
persons of one self thing it passes unto him unto whom seisin is first
delivered according to the verse.

Rem domino vel non domino vendente duobus,

In iure est potior, traditione prior.

Where the gift or grant is of lands or tenements in lease, they commonly
pass by Atturnement of the particular tenants thereof, and not by Liuerie of
seisin. And the like order is to pass things which cannot pass but by grant
in writing, as services, reuersions, remainders, rents, commons etc. of which
it shall be entreated in the Chapter of Graunts, Litt^ Sect' 283. Also by every
Liuerie of seisin passes an estate of freehold at the least.

The manner of indorsing or entering of Liuerie upon deeds of feoffement by the
feoffor to the feoffee in their own persons, Thus.

and showed to us, we rather understand the contrary to be true, therefore we
being desirous to set all doubtful matters apart, and willing also the said I.
and W. to be no further grieved or molested wrongfully without sufficient
cause, and that they may from henceforth live in suertie of the same, have

Attornement.
The form of indorsing or entering of Attornement of Tenants.
ANd because lands and tenements and such things as naturally Sect. 382.
lie in grant cannot be transferred from one to another by bare grants of the
parties, without the attornement and agreement of others, it is meet somewhat to
discourse of Attornement. An Attornement therefore is the agreement of the
tenants of the land, which is when the seigniory, rent, reuersion, or remainder
is granted unto him to whom the same is granted. And every Attornement is
either actual, or in law: An actual Attornement is the expressed consent of
the tenant to such grant in any such deed by some ouert or open act, as by
saying, I become your tenant according to this deed: Or that he likes well
thereof, or is contented therewith, or that he attorneth tenant to the grauntee
according to the tenor thereof, giving to him some money in name of Atto^nement
etc. Littleton 551. Plowden 25. a. 344. a. Attornement in law is when the
person that ought to attorne does not by plain and express woord^, as is
aforesaid, declare his consent to such a grant, but does some other such act as
in law sufficiently implies and argues his agreement thereunto: As if there
be Lord and Tenant, and the tenant leaseth for life to a woman, the remainder
in fee to an other, and the woman takes an husband to whom the Lord grants
the services: Or if there be Lord and Tenant, who marries a wife, and after
the Lord grants the services to her, and her husband accepts the deed: Or
if a lease be made for life, or years, and after he that has the reuersion or
remainder, grants the same to his lessee, who accepts of the deeds. These
and such like be Attornements in law, Littleton Sect 558. 559. 560. 561. 564.
etc.

Attornement of tenant for life.
MEmorandum that the within named E. M. being tenant for Sect. 383.
term of life of the said manor of Q. and other the lands and inheritance
expressed in this Indenture, did the 5. day of I. in this present month of
June, the 32. year of the Queens Majesty's reign that now is, attorne unto
the within named I. B. according to the effect of the grant mentioned in the
said Indenture: And for proof thereof did give unto him the said I. in name of
Attornement the sum of iiii. d. of usual English money. in the presence of
these persons whose names are subscribed, viz. A. B. C. D. etc.

Or thus by diverse Tenants.
Memorand' that the persons whose names are under written, tertio die ^. and
anno etc. did attorne and become tenants unto the within named E. B. and M. his
wife, according to the purport of the lease within mentioned. And for proof
thereof every one of them did give unto the said E. and M. one penie in the
name of Attornement.

Or thus in Latin.
Memorand' etiam quod 16. die M. anno s^prad' R. S. G. H. G. C. etc. ten^ diue^

Confirmations.
IT now appears partly how every seueralestate inay be created, Sect. 457.
wherefore it seems very meet, if such estates shall Happen to be defeasible,
to show how the same may be made good, which may be don by confirmation or
releas of him which has a better or longer estate in the thing granted then
the tenant thereof has: For Confirmare by Littletons mind, Sect' 522. is
nothing else but only firmum facere, namely to make strong and sure such an
estate as before the same confirmation, was for some cause voidable, and yet
not merely void. Deeds of Confirmation bin made thus.

otherwise, as his estate is which you would confirm, with such warrantie and

Also in Confirmations it is not amiss in the premises of the deed, specially
to recite the estate of the tenant which must be confirmed, and also the estate
of him that shall confirm, and to express the consideration thereof, if any
such be.

Letters of Attorney.
What and how necessary Atturneis be.
HItherto have we, in some sort, entreated of such acts and instruments Sect.
516.
as are made and done by the parties themselves, being personally present: now
we intend to set down such Instruments, as give aucthority to other as their
Factours or Atturneys, to do the like for them. And that the rather, for that
mention is made before, that Liuerie of feisin may be made by Proctors or
Atturneis, aucthorized thereunto by written Warrants. And even as Liuerie of
seisin, so may many other acts and Instruments in civil causes be performed
by Atturneis which seems very reasonable, for that that many times the
parties themselves, are so hindered either by infirmity, or by such
multiplicitie of business and affairs in sundry places at one time, that they
cannot possibly be present at al: wherefore Atturneis be very necessary and
profitable for humane society: which be defined such persons as by the consent,
commandment or requests of the parties do take heed, see too, and take upon
them the charge to do other men's business and affairs in their absence,
according to the authority and trust to the^ committed by the owners thereof.
In Instruments making and ordeining of Atturneis, which be sometimes called
letters of Attorney, sometimes Warra^ts of Attorney, sometimes Proxies or
Procuratio^s, seem necessarily to be considered six things, viz. First the name
of the party which is to make the Instrument, and of him which is to be made
Attorney. 2. The Atturneis consent to the same. 3. Against whom. 4. In what
matter or cause. 5. Before what Judge or other person. 6. For what act or end,
All which things will plainly appear in the ensamples following:

In most humble wise complaining shows unto your most excellent Highness,
your Orator and faithful subject T. D. of Greyes Inn: That whereas one I. D.
deceased Doctor of the Laws, for the zeal and love that he had to his
Country, and to the education and bringing up of youth in virtue and learning,
gave, granted, confirmed, and assured certain lands and tenements in the
County of Y. of the clear yearly value of fifteen pounds, above all charges
and reprises, unto the Master, Fellows, and Scholars of S. John's College in
C. to have and to hold to them and their successors for ever, to the intent,
that they the said Master, Fellows, and Scholars, and their successors for
ever, should remain and keep in their College five Scholars that had been
brought up in the Grammar School, freely erected by the said I. D. in P. in
your Graces County of Y. for ever, in such manner and form, as is is
contained in a deed of composition quadripartite Indented of the said I. D.
bearing date the first day of September, in the year of our Lord God 1515.
and in the seventh year of the Reign of the late king of famous memory
Henry the eight, being made to the said Master, Fellows, and Scholars, as
more plainly does and may appear. And amongst the provisions, graunts,
articles, and agreementes of the said composicion it is contained, That the
Master, Wardens, and brethren of a certain Fraternity and Guild in P.
aforesaid, founded there by the said I. D. by the license of the said late
King of famous memory H. viii. should always when the said Scholars rooms,
or any of them fortuned to be void by death, resignation, forfaiture, or
otherwise have the election, nomination, and appointment of a Scholar, or so
many Scholars as then might, or would supply the room or rooms of the said
Scholars then being vacant or void in the said College. And that the said
Masters, Fellows, and Scholars of saint John's College should always give
knowledge unto the Masters, Wardens, and Brethren of the said Guilde, when any
such auoydance should happen to fall by any the means aforesaid, within a
certain time appointed within the said composition, as therein more plainly
appears. And now most gracious Sovereign L. by reason of the Statute made in
the first year of your most noble reign, for the dissolution of Chauntries,
Colleges, free Chapels, Guildes, and Fraternities, although the meaning of
the matters of the said Statute was not to hurt, alter, or change any such
good and godly foundations, made only for the increase of learning, but rather
to fortify, augment and enlarge such godly foundations and ordinances: yet
that notwithstanding, the said fraternity and Guild only founded for the godly
intentes aforesaid, by the said Statute made for the dissolution of Chantries,
Fraternities and Guildes, as is aforesaid, colourably under the pretense of
Fraternity supersticiously used, is no we dissolved and taken away, and by the
means thereof the benefit and preferrement which the Scholars of the said
free School in P. aforesaid have always had sithence the said foundation
made, is likely to be clearly gone and taken away, most contrary to the
meaning and good intent of the said godly ordinance and foundation. And yet
the said College of Saint I. at this day is possessed and seized of the said
lands and tenements, given only for the intents and purposes aforesaid, which
thing is like to ensue to the great displeasure and loss of the inheritance of
the said Town of P. and of all the Country there, unless it shall please
your Majesty, that the said godly ordinance may be perfited, recontinued and
established by some good and godly devise and ordinance. And whereas your said
Orator is seized in his demean as of fee, as well of the Schoolehouse of the
said free School, as also of all the lands and tenements purchased by the
said I. D. Doctor of the Laws for the maintenance of the said free grammar
School, without any use declared, And no other devise as yet made for the more
perfect continuance of the said free grammar School, so that if your said
subject should chance to die, whereof he is most assured, it is not certain
that the said lands shall be employed unto the use and godly intent aforesaid,
as heretofore they have been. May it therefore please your most excellent
highness, tenderly considering the premises, that it may be enacted with the
assent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, in manner and form
following. First that it shall and may be lawful unto the said Master and
Fellows of the said College of Saint I. in C. and their successors for ever,
to nominate and appoint one discreet and well learned man to supply the room
of the Schoolmaster of the said free grammar School. And that it shall be
lawful for the said Schoolmaster, with the Churchwardens of the Parish
Church of P. aforesaid, to nominate and appoint one sufficient learned young
man to be the usher of the said free grammar School. And that as often as the
said Schoolemasters room shall fortune to be void by death, resignation, or
otherwise: that then it shall be lawful for the said Masters and Fellows of
S. I. College. and their successors for ever, to nominate and appoint one
discreet and well learned man, as is aforesaid, to supply the room of the said
Schoolmaster then being void. And in like manner and as often as it shall
fortune the said Vshers room to be void by any the means aforesaid: that then
it shall be lawful for the said Schoolmaster and Churchwardens, and their
successors for ever, to nominate and apoint one well and sufficiently learned
young man to supply the room of the said usher then being void. And that y^
said Master and Usher for the time being for ever, shall by the authority of
this present Parliament be incorporated by the name of Master and Usher of the
said free grammar School of P. And that they and their successors, shall have
perpetual succession in the same for ever. And that the said Schoolmaster and
usher of the said free school of P. aforesaid for the time being, shall be
enabled by thauthority of this present Parliament, to receive to them and their
successors in perpetuity for ever, of the gift and grant of the said T. D. or
of any other person or persons, lands, tenements, annuities, and rents of the
clear yearly value of xx. l.. and not above, for the exercising and using of
the said room and rooms of the Schoolmaster and Usher, of the said free
grammar School. And that the said Master, and Usher, and either of them and
their successors, and the successor of either of them, shall and may be
enabled by the authority aforesaid to sue and be sued, to implead and to be
impleaded, for any matter or cause concerning the said lands, tenements,
annuities, and rents, or any parcel thereof, by the name of Master and Usher
of the said free grammar School in P. aforesaid. And that from henceforth as
often as the said five Scholars rooms, or any of them within the said
College of Saint I. shall fortune to be void by any the means abouesaid: that
then it shall and may be lawful unto the said Master of the said free Grammar
School in P. and his successors for ever etc. Nos autem tenores breuis and
actus praedict^, ad requisition^ T. D. gen^ de Greis Inn, duximus

desire and pray you, that ye will vouchsafe to grant me the next Aduowson

sake to present A. B. to the same, who is my very loving friend, and such a

Which doing, ye shall do unto me a special pleasure, and give me cause to

Notes touching Presentations.
IF a Church be void by resignation, then ye shall say. Sect. 598.
Modo per liberam et spontaneam resignationem A. B. vltimi Incumbentis eiusdem,
vacant^ etc.

If by attainder, then thus.

Per attiucturam A. B. vltimi incumbentis ibidem, qui de alta proditrone nup er
attinctus fuit vacant^. Et sic de consimilibus.

Also ye shall understand, that the Kings Majesty has as the case requires,
sundry Titles to present, for sometime he presents by his Prerogative Royal,
and then ye shall say.

Et ad nostram donation^, ratione praerogatiuae nostrae Regiae spectantem etc.

Sometime by reason that the Temporalities of a Bishopric be in his hands,
and then ye shall say.

Ratione temporalium Episcopatus N. in manibus nostris existentium.

Sometime his Grace presents by the grant of an Aduowson of another man, and
then ye shall say.

Ratione concessionis A. B. cum idem A. primam et proximam aduocationem eiusd'
nobis largitus est etc.

And if the manor whereunto thaduowson is appendant be parcel of the Duchy of
Lancaster, then ye shall say.

Et ad nostram donationem ratione Ducatus nostri Lancastr^ spectant^ etc. Et
sic de reliquis.

In a presentation by this word Eccles. parochial', is intended always a
Parsonage: Howbeit now a days many be wont to write, Ad Rectoriam Ecclesiae
parochialis de N. But if the presentation be to a Vicarage, then may ye not
say, ad Eccles. but ad Vicariam, And the presentment to a Vicarage appertains
of common right to the Parson, for the Vicar in effect is but the Parsons
deputy: Howbeit the Parson with assent of his Patron and ordinary may grant
away the patronage of the Vicarage from him and his successors to another man
and his heirs or successors for ever. Sometime one man has the nomination to
a benefice, and another the presentation: In which case he that has the
presentation can present no other person to the Ordinary, but such as the other
man shall name by his sufficient writing under seal. Also the King shall join
with no man in presentment, but shall have the whole presentment alone in all
cases.

And if the King be entitled by reason of the custody of his ward, then ye
shall say: Et ad nostram donationem ratione custod' terrae and haeredis eiusdem
Comitis de A. defuncti, and qui de nobis tenuit in capite, and in manu nostra
existentis, spectant^ etc.

And if the King be entitled by reason of the temporalties and possessions of
an Archbishopricke or Bishopric, being in time of vacation in his hands,
then ye shall say in the presentation: Et quae ad nostram spectat donation^

Finally, concerning Chauntries, Free chapels, and Prebends, ye shall observe
and know, that some be presentatiue, and some donatiue. Presentatiues, be of
such nature, that ye cannot confer them but by way of presentation to the
Ordinary, the form whereof is set forth before. But Chauntries, free
Chapels, and Prebends donariue be of that nature, that ye need not to
present the person to whom ye will confer the same, to the Ordinary, but it
suffices to give the same by your charter of grant under your seal: The form
whereof insueth hereafter. But take heed ye present not your Clerk to the
Ordinary unto that which is donatiue by your letters Patentes, for if you do,
the nature is changed, and you can no more make collation of it, but you must
needs now present your Clerk to the Ordinary, which if you do not within
six Months, the Ordinary may take advantage of the Laps.

Copies of Court Roll.
What a Copiholder is.
TEnant by Copy of Court Roll, is he which is Sect. 603.
admitted tenant of any lands or tenements within a Manor, that time out of
the memory of man, by the use and custom of the said Manor have been
dimiseable and demised to such as will take the same in fee, fee tail, for
life, years, or at will, according to the custom of the said Manor by Copy of
Court Roll of the same Manor. And therefore they be called Tenants by Copy of
Court Roll, because they have no other Writings or Evidence concerning such
their lands and tenements, but only the Copies of the Rolls of the Courts of
the Manners, within which they lie. And in ancient time, as Master Fitzherbert
says in his Natura breuium fol. 12. C. they were called Tenants in villenage,
or in base tenure, or by Virge. And in the Saxons time before the Conquest,
such lands were called Folk^sland: At which time Charter lands were termed
Bockland, Master Kitchen fol. 128. b. And Copies of Court Rolls be such
Instruments as do contain the Surrenders, Presentations, Admittances, or
other acts entered in the Rolls of the Court, within which such Customarie
lands lie and concern the estates thereof and be exemplified out of the same
Rolls in form following, videlicet.

Curia parua praenobilis G. Comitis Salop^ etc. Manerij sui Sheffeld

Instructions for the making of Surrenders and Copies.
FIrst Note, that all the customs, fines, rents, and services, which Sect. 605.
Copyholders ought to do, be certainly set down in their Copies. And that the
lands be certainly bounded. And in like manner of all Mines of Lead, Ore,
Tin, Iron, stone, coals, and quarries, and such like, and all intakes,
enclosures, and improuements.

If the party admitted tenant be within age, his fealty must be respited till
he be of the full age of xxi. years, and so entered in the Roll and Copy.

Such estate, agreements, covenants, and conditions, may be made of Copyhold
lands, by Copy, as are made of Charter lands by deed Mutatis mutandis.

If the old Copies chance to be lost, or destroyed, the Steward may make new
according to the ancient Court Rolls.

Surrenders may be made in Court, And by the Customs of diverse Seigniories,
the same may be made out of the Court to the Steward, Baylife, or Reeue of the
manor, or to one, two, or more Copyholders of the same manor, or before two
honest men of the same Seigniorie, and then the same must be presented at the
next Court, or some other Court of the same manor, as the custom thereof is.

By the custom of some Manors, Surrenders, and admittances of Copyholders may
be made by Attorney, by virtue of Letters of Attorney.

In some Manors, the tenants have their lands granted unto them, and their
heirs, in fee, fee tail, or for life, or years, according to the custom of
the Manor, And not at the will of the Lord, according to the custom: In which
case the Rolls and Copies ought to be made accordingly.

Within some Manors the Copies have used to be sealed with the Seal of the
Steward: And in some not.

In every case, the Custom of the manors must be diligently inquired of, and
duly observed by such as make Surrenders and Copies.

It is very good to have in every several Manor a Customarie fair engrossed
in parchme^t, of all the customs, fines, duties, estates, and services, and
other circumstances concerning the Copyhold lands within the same Manor.

Item such estates in fee, fee tail, for life, or lives, years, or at will,
absolute or condicional, may be limited as well by Copy, as by Charter, Mutatis
mutandis.

Item the Names and Additions of persons and Lands, and other circumstances of
time and place may be so set down in Copies, as in Charters: Mutatis mutandis,
And the same to be agreed to, by all the Customarie tenants of the same Manor,
with the assent of the Lord of the Manor, and to be presented by the Homage
upon their oaths, and entered into the Rolls of the Court thereof, for the
certain information of the Lord, and his tenants, or that ought to be given,
taken, done, or demanded for the same.

Item the same reseruations of rents, customs, services, heriots, disseisins,
reentries, and other things, may be contained in the Copies, as they be in
Charters: Mutatis mutandis.

Last Wills and Testaments.
Having hitherto entreated of Instruments of Sect. 632.
such contracts as take effect in the life time of yus parties, with their
manifold differences and examples: It is now time to deal with Instruments
which take effect after their deaths. Of which sort be last Wills and
Testaments, and letters of administration, which is a matter of no less
difficulty the^ those other, as well for their great diversity, as also for
their obscurity, ambiguitie, and incertainty: For many times it is doubtful in
what sense the Testator would have his words taken, Insomuch that his will
therein may rather by probable arguments be gessed then rightly gathered.

By means whereof it happens oftentimes, that things well meant by the
Testators, are evil and diversely understood by their posterity and suruiuors.
Which difficulty deceives sometimes not only the common sort, but even men of
good judgment: Insomuch that of one self question they pronounce different
opinions.

As if a man devise lands to I. S. to have and to hold to him for ever, and
die, and the deuisee enter into the same lands, some think he has thereby
fee, Littlet^ Sect. 586. and 22. E. 3.

And others think he has only an estate for the term of his life, for they
hold that these words (for ever) can extend to none other then the deuisee,
because no more persons be named in the devise. And that the life of man in this
respect, is said to be for ever with him. Perkins Sect. 557.

But seeing all the ambiguities and incertaintie of Wills happen chiefly
through their obscurity in the words or sentences thereof, it behooves
Notaries, and such as write Wills, to have special care to set down the
Testators very sense and mind very plainly, with apt and significant words
and phrases omitting all such as be either hard to be understood or diversely
to be taken.

Notwithstanding that Wills being doubtful, are always to receive a benign
and favorable interpretation, that if by any means it can, they may stand and
be of force: for much better it is that Wills be perspicuous of themselves, then
to be enlightened by the exposition and allowance of others.

We will therefore in this treatise, discourse of some points of the doctrine
and examples of last Wills and Testaments plainly and briefly, leaving
precise and curious questions to be handled by others of better skill.

Of civil succession, and what last Wills and Testaments be.
LAst Wills and Testaments, are a kind of Civil successions. Sect. 633.
For civil succession is divided into succession immediate or lawful, and
mediate or testamentarie.

Succession mediate or testamentarie, is when the person deceased made a will.

This has his efficacy by law, and that by man's will which receives full
strength by and after the Testators death, and not before, and therefore is
called a last will.

The other is called lawful succession, because it has being by the operation
of law only.

And the mediate succession, is termed testamentarie (by Senecdoche) for that a
testament is the principal kind or part of last Wills.

Hereby it seems with us that an Executor may be termed a successor
testamentary, which is made by the last Will.

And an Administrator, a Successor lawful, which succeeds him which dies
intestate.

And for so much as while a Testament is hoped, there is no place for lawful
succession, the doctrine of that ought to preceede this.

A last will therefore (vltima voluntas) is the disposition or bestowing of a
man's own goods and lands, taking effect after his death.

And it is Testamentarie or Codicillarie: namely which is made by Testament, or
Codicill, or Scedule.

A testament is defined by most men voluntatis nostrae iusta sententia, de eo
quod quis post mortem suam ficri velit, for the perfiting of which definition,
it seems good to add these words, ( cum executoris institutione) for without
an executor there can be no testament, for thappointment of an executor is the
true formal cause thereof, giving essence thereunto.

And therefore some shortly define a Testament (haeredis institutio) which is
the naming of an executor, whereupon we may say, a Testament is a just
sentence, or declaration of our mind, concerning that which we would have done
after our deaths, with the ordaining of an Executor thereof.

Or rather a testament is a last Will, which of his own nature in it self
contains a direct institution of an executor.

The doctrine of Testaments stands upon two parts, the making and a
destroying thereof, both which, and also the will of every testator are to be
measured by the rules of the law.

The making of a Testament, is the right which gives the communion or
participation of the Testament. And this is chiefly regarded in the persons,
and in the form of the Testament.

And persons are principal or less principal: The principal persons be the
testator and the executor, less principal be the witnesses and legatories:
Hereupon the making only of a testament is active and passive.

The active making of a Testament is which belongs to the Testator, that he
have right to make a Testament.

And the passive making of a Testament, is that right which pertains to the
executor and other persons less principal in Testaments, as to be made
executors, legatories, or witnesses thereof, to take some legacies or benefits
thereby.

What persons may make Testaments, and what not.
And all persons as well males as females may be Testators and Sect. 634.
make Testaments, but such as are prohibited: of which some are forbidden to
make Testaments by nature, and some by law.

By nature, through defect of mind or body, but no longer then such defect
indureth.

This defect of mind is when either his age is such that he wants discretion,
or being of age wants it by chance, either natural or casual: Of the first
sort be children which know not what they should do, as men under xiiii.
years old, and women under xii. years, which above that age may make
Testaments, but not of their lands of inheritance before the age of xxi.
years, 34. H. 8. cap. 5. S. Lib. 1. cap. 21. lib. 2. capit. 28. Hereunto may
be added doting old persons wanting judgment, and drunkards void of reason.

Of the latter sort be mad folks and Idiots at the time of the making of
the Testament.

The defect of body, is such infirmity by which the principal senses
necessary for the making of Wills are hindered, as deafnes, blindness, and
dumbnes.

Dumb or deaf folks by nature can make no Testamentes, but they being so by
chance or accident may make testamentes if they be learned, and can write and
read.

And blind folks and dumb folks may in some cases by signs, if they could
once speak.

By law are forbidden Testari such as be subject to others power, as
bondslaues, villeines; (but such as be executors to others) and women covert,
without consent of their husbands (except executrices to others, or of thoses
in action) Monks, Ehanons, Friars, and such other superstitious votaries. 14.
H. 8. 16. 2. R. 2. 5. And such as have no estate or habisitie, as Traitors,
felons, convict, notorious heretics, Apostataes, captives by inst wars,
persons outlawed or waiuted, persons imprisoned by dures, a felon of himself:
for these persons have no goods:

Who may be Executors or legatories, and who not.
The passive making of a Willis a right to take by a Testament, Sect. 635.
which right allloiall subjects have, as freemen, villeins, men, women, single
or married, children, yea, though they be in their mothers womb, lay men and
clerks, But Traitors, Felons, heretics, apostates, persons outlawed, and such
others, may not make Testaments: nay, neither be Executors nor legatories.

What persons may be witnesses of Testaments.
Persons less principal are witnesses of the making of the Testament, Sect.
636.
which must be three or four, or more sufficient persons having power to make
Testaments, and void of all natural and civil impediments which may impeach
their credit and testimony.

How Testaments are to be made.
We have spoken of the persons requisite in Testaments: now Sect. 637.
let us view their form or manner of making and publishing of them. The form
truly of making of Testaments, is the very disposition of the Testament
rightly made, which is considered in the substance and inward form thereof,
and in the outward action of making and proof of the same Testament.

The substance or form of Testaments consists in the very institution and
the ordeyning of an Executor, and in the things of which disposition is
thereby made.

The institution of an Executor, is nothing else, but the Testators naming and
appointment whom he will have to be his successor in his stead to enter and to
have his goods and cattels; use actions against his debtors, and to pay his
debts and legacies so far as his goods and cattels will extend.

And an Executor may be either of all the Testament, and then he is termed
universal, or of part, as of plate etc. and then he is named a particular
Executor.

Furthermore, the institution of an Executor is pure or mixed.

A pure institution of an Executor, is, when one or more Executors be simply
made without time or condition: for the Testator may assign as many Executors
as he will, being capable thereof, as if he say, I make A. B. mine Executor, or
any other words of the like sense.

The mixed institution of a Testament is upon time or upon condition.

Upon time, as if the Testator make I. S. his Executor, when he comes to full
age, or from London, or while he dwells at L. etc. and such like referrences
to time, as to make him executor during ten years, or after ten years etc.

Upon Condition, as when the Testator appoints I. S. his executor, if he
before probate of the testament find sufficient suerties for the performance of
his will, or with the addition of any other possible honest condition or
conditions, for impossible conditions hinder not the pure making of the
executors.

And as one or more Executors may be made simply or conditionally, or with
reference to time: so may Legacies and Devises be made to one or more simply or
conditionally, or with reference to or from time.

And note, that although that in the assignation of Executors, and giving of
Legacies, and making of Devises our law respects not so much the natural
property and signification of words, as the true intent and meaning of the
Testator, whose mind is the very life and soul of the testament: yet it is
always very requisite that the writers of Testaments do express the same
with as apt and significant words as may be for avoiding of all scruples as may
otherwise happen by doing the contrary.

Of making of Testaments.
It follows to speak of the very action of making a Testament which
consists chiefly in the fact thereof, and putting of witnesses thereunto,
which is to be done at one self time.

The form of publishing a Testament is the very action whereby a Testament is
produced, publicly opened, recited, or made known.

Of the destroying of Testaments.
The destroying or weakening of a Testament, is when the Sect. 638.
person named Executor, can not, or will not be executor, or die before he
shall take upon him the executorship, or shall not be capable thereof.

Of a Codicill.
THe latter kind or part of succession universal, is termed Codicillarie.
Sect. 639.


A Codicill is an imperfect last Will of one testate, or intestate, not
appointing any executor, which may be either written or nuncupatiue.

And it skilleth not in what part of a testament the executor is named. Howbeit
it seems good to name him in the very beginning, because the appointing of an
executor is the very head and foundation of a Testament, without the which,
neither can it stand, nor any devise or legacy be effectual. And again a
Codicill is either perfect or imperfect.

A perfect Codicill, is a Codicill having an oblique institution of an
executor: this Codicill resembles a Testament, and is in stead of a Testament
of one dying intestate.

An imperfect Codicill is an addition annexed to a Testament, and it is
testamentarie or subsidiarie.

A Codicill testamentarie, is a part of the Testament, and an addition or
supplement thereunto, by which some thing is added to a testament, or some
thing detracted there from the testator for the explaning or amendment thereof.

A subsidiarie Codicill is inserted into a Testament, to the end that if, that
it be not of force by the right of a Testament, it may be effectual as a
Codicill, and is rather termed a Codicillarie clause then a Codicill.

Of a Testament written and nuncupatiue.
And every Testament is either written or nuncupatiue: A written Sect. 640.
testament is that which at the very time of the making thereof is put in
writing, by which kind of testaments only lands and tenements may be devised,
for they cannot pass by a nuncupatiue in our last will made by word.

A nuncupatiue Testament is, when the testator does by word only without
writing declare his will before a sufficient number of credible witnesses.

Testaments nuncupatiue for the better proof and continuance thereof, may
after the making of the same be put in writing and proved: which
notwithstanding that they be so written are still called and are in deed
Testaments nuncupatiue.

Of succession universal lawful, and administration.
When he that is dead is intestate, either for that he made no Sect. 641.
Testament, or made one, and the executor refuse to prove it, or otherwise, is
of no force: Then lawful or inunediate succession takes place.

And this succession is called Administration, which is that trust which the
Ordinary of the place where the intestate died, commits to any person
touching the intestates goods, cattels, credits and rights, for whersoeuer a
man dies intestate, the Ordinary of that place may commit thadministration of
his goods to his wife (if the suruine) or to the next of the intestates kin
requiring the same, by the Statute 21. Hen. 8. cap. 5.

And the power and charge of an Administrator is equal in every respect to
the power and charge of executors, for they are both to have and sue for his
goods and debts withholden from them, and are bound to pay his debts by
specialtie, according to the value of his goods. 31 E. 3. cap. 11.

And sometimes further by their delays of false plees which lie in their own
notice, and being true, are peremtorie bars to the creditors of their testator
or intestate. But haste we to the several forms of Testaments, Codicils, and
bills of Administration, beginning with Testaments.

A very perfect form of a Will.
IN the name of God, Amen. The xxvi. day of April in the year Sect. 642.
of our Lord God, one thousand five hundred and nintie two, I. I. H. the
unprofitable servant of GOD, weak in body, but strong in mind, do willingly
and with a free heart render and give again into the hands of my Lord GOD
and Creator, my spirit, which he of his fatherly goodness gave unto me,
when he first fashioned me in my mothers womb, making me a living and a
reasonable creature, nothing doubting but that for his infinite mercies, set
forth in the precious blood of his derely beloved son Jesus Christ our only
Savior and Redeemer, he will receive my soul into his Glory, and place it
in the company of the heavenly Angels and blessed Saints. And as concerning my
body even with a good will and free heart I give it over, commending it to the
earth where of it came, nothing doubting but according to the Article of my
faith, at the great day of the general resurrection when we shall appear
before the judgment seat of Christ, I shall receive the same again by the
mighty power of GOD, wherewith he is able to subdue all things to himself,
not a corruptible, mortal, weak, and vile body, as it is now, but an
incorruptible, immortal, strong, and perfect body in all points like unto
the glorious body of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. First as touching my
Wife with whom I coupled my self in the fear of God, refusing al other
women, I linked my self unto her, living with her in the blessed estate of
honorable wedlock, by whom also by the blessing of God I have now four
Sons and three daughters viz. F. W. L. I. Ia. F. and A. And albeit I doubt
not but that God after my departure, according to his promise will be unto her
a busba^d, yea a father, a patron, and defender, and will not suffer her to
lack if she trust, fear, and serve him diligently, calling upon his holy
name: yet for as much as God has blessed me with worldly substance, and she
is mine own flesh, and who so provides not for his, denies the faith, and
is worse then an Infidel: I therefore give and bequeath unto her for term of
her life, if she remain so long unmarried, the occupation of this house, and
fermeholdes wherein I now dwell at H. with the appurtenances, even as I
presently occupy the same. And also the rentes and profits yearly arising of
my fermeholdes in H. in the tenure of I. T. And likewise the occupation of all
other my lands and tenements, set, lying and being in the Parish of O. in the
County of Y. doing no waste, with also her thirdes out of all my goods (except
my leases) observing the conditions, gifts, bequests and legacies hereafter
ensuing in full recompense of her thirdes or dower of all my lands and
tenements. And except and always reserved to me and mine heirs for ever, my
Ring of gold which I use to wear and seal withal, and all mine armor and
furniture for the wars etc. with all the glass and wainskot in and about my
houses at H. All which my will is, shall be annered to the freehold, and
remain as heirelomes to my said house and mine heirs for ever.

And if it shall Fortune my said wife to marry again and take an husband,
then my will and full mind is, that my said house at H. and all other my said
lands, tenementes and fermes at H. and O. aforesaid with their profits and
appurtenances, shall remain, descend and come immediately to the use, behoof
and occupation of W. L. I. and A. my children, during the minority of mine
heir male (doing no manner of waste during the said term.) And in full
recompense thereof, my said wife to have during the term of her life natural
the sum of xl. pounds of lawful money paid yearly out of my foresaid lands
and tenements in H. and O. wherewith she says she is now right well pleased
and contented: Let this suffice for my wives portion, whom I doubt not but God
will take into his protection, and so provide for her in the time of her short
pilgrimage, that she shall want no good thing, and I heartily desire her, that
she be diligent in trayning up our said children in the fear and doctrine of
the Lord, so shall God be unto her a husband, and to the children a Father.
Moreover as touching my children, albeit I am fully persuaded that God
according to his promise will be a Father unto them, and if they live in his
fear he will not see them lack, yet since the law of God and nature require
that I should have a reasonable care of them: Therefore I give unto mine eldest
son F. and to the issue male of his body lawfully begotten, all my lands,
tenements, and hereditame^ts with their appurtenances in H. and A. etc. or
elsewhere within the Realm of England, purchased of A. B. the portion appointed
to my said wife, for and during her life unto her marriage as aforesaid always
excepted and forprised. And for default of such issue, to W. my second son,
and to the like issue male of his body. And for default of such issue to L. my
third son, and to the like issue male of his body. And for default of such
issue to the next heirs of me the said I. H. for ever. And to the said I. and
A. H. I give and bequeath the other two parts of my goods, except my leases,
and one hundredth pounds given to W. and L. as hereafter is expressed and
appointed. Provided always, that if my said sons W. and L. or either of them
do fortune to die before they shall accomplish the full age of xxi. years,
then the suruiuor of them shall enjoy such his portion, as is limited and
appointed to be paid, that is to say, fifty pounds to each of them.

And if it fortune God to take to his mercy both my said younger sons before
the accomplishment of the said xxi. years above recited, that then both their
said portions to be equally divided amongst my daughters then living. And if it
fortune my wife to be with child at the time of my death, then that child to
have as much in every respect as the said I. and A. throughout all the two
parts of my said goods, and all other legacies before or hereafter mentioned,
appointed and set out. Provided always that if I marry any of my said
daughters before my death, then that daughter to have no part of my said two
parts of my said goods in any other sort then as to have her part of such
child's portions of my goods, as shall fortune to die, as is hereafter
expressed. Provided that all my leases shall be taken as no part of my goods,
but delivered unto my superuisors safely to be kept to the use of my next heir
during the nonage of my said next heir, putting in good suerties in one
thousand Marks to my said superuisors and executors, and administrators, or
some of them, to answer such portions and legacies as herein is mentioned,
declared, appointed and given to the rest of his brethren and sisters out of my
said leases, as also truly to observe such limitations and estates as herein
are also appointed or set out. And that he shall not alien, bargain, or self
my of my leases, but that the same shall after his decease remain to my next
heir male, for the better maintenance of this my house at H. and so from heir
male to heir male. Nor shall not make any leases above the term of twenty
and one years, or one or two lives at the most, reserving the rents now
accustomed.

And if he shall refuse so to do, then two whole parts of all my said whole
lands to go to W. my second son, he putting in good suerties as is
aforesaid. And in default thereof then to L. likewise as above is said. Item, I
will that in case two parts of my goods will not answer every of my daughters
the full sum of two hundred pounds for their marriages, then I will that there
shall be taken out of mine own lands commonly called T. xx. pounds yearly and
out of my lease of H. yearly until such time as every of my said i^ daughters
have had the just sum of etc. for their said filial portions.

And if it shall fortune any of my said daughters to die before the age of xix.
years unmarried, or married or having any issue of her body lawfully begotten:
Then I will that her portion s^ dying shall remain to the other of her brethren
and sisters suruyuing. And if it shall fortune, God to take an other of my said
daughters in manner and form abouesaid: That then the second daughters portion
so dying shall be likewise equally divided between my younger sons and the
daughter then suruyuing. Provided always, that if the said W. and L. or any of
them do refuse to stand to this mine appointment: That then they to have only
their filial portions of my goods, and no part of my leases or other annuities
or legacies in this my will given or bequeathed unto them, or any of them, and
that then the said legacies or annuities appointed herin to go wholly to my
daughters, till such time as every of them have the said CC. l. paid for every
their portions. And if my wife bestow any more on my said sons, let it be
upon their good behauior toward her. And yet if it fortune my said wife to die
before they or any of them do accomplish the age of xxvi. years, applying them
selfs obedient and likewise diligently at their learning, I will then after
her decease, they and either of them so applying, and being under the age of
twenty six years shall have paid forty shillings more yearly out of my
moitie of B. until such time as they and either of them do accomplish the
full age of forty years, if they so long do line. Item, I will in
consideration of my said daughters portion so appointed out of my said goods:
That W. H. my second Son shall have one yearly annuitie of fifteen pounds
during the minority of mine heir, whereof eight pounds six shillings and
eight pence to be taken of the profits arising of my lease in B. and vi. l.
xiii. s^. iiii. d. out of my moitie of A. And after such time as my said heir
shall accomplish his full age, then and from thencefoorth the said W. to have
the said fifteen pounds paid yearly out of B. during xiii. years then next
following, if the said W. so long do live. And if he die before the end of the
said xiii. years, and leave issue of his body lawfully begotten, then that
issue to have only vi. pounds xiii. shillings iiii. pence, paid yearly
during the years to expend of the said xiii. years, if that issue so long do
live, to be taken of the profits of B. aforesaid, at the feasts of Pentecost

that if it shall fortune God to take all mine heirs, before they shall have

hundred marks, as above is mentioned, I give as a token of continual
remembrance of the hearty zeal, love, and affection I hear to the advancement
of the issue general of me and my said children, as also the surname and whole
blood of me the said I. H. and the issue of my said brother. Item I give and
bequeath unto my said loving brother R. H. if he be living at the day of my
death, my best gown etc. Item I give unto every of my servants in my house at
the day of my death etc. if they use themselves diligently and honestly toward
my wife during one year then following etc. Item I give to P. W. my godsonne
one colt of three or four years old, to be delivered unto him when he shall

Provided always, that if my wife do make any challenge or claim to any part
of the thirdes, either of my lands or goods, or to any part thereof by force of
being executrix, other then before is mentioned, and set out of her, as in such
like cases many unkind women have done contrary to the good meaning, will,
and trust of their husbands in prejudice of their natural children, which my
said wife has faithfully promised to me she will not do, the rather for that
I have done nothing herein but by her full consent and agreement in every
behalf, that then she to lose the benefit of al such legacies, and all other
commodities appointed and given hereby to her, and the same to remain amongst
all my children. Now as touching the poor, insomuch, as these worldly goods
were given to me, that I should distribute part thereof to their necessity,
viz. the poor, lame, blind, and comfortles: And albeit I have bin quick in
words, to such as were sturdy vagabonds, and idle loiterers well able to get
their living by their labor, yet I have not altogether bin unmindful of the^,
but distributed part of such as God sent me, having always thought it better
in those causes to work while I lived in this world, then to have them done
after my departure by executors. Yet notwithstanding I will, that there be
distributed and given amongst the poor within the parishes of A. upon the S.
x. pound, which I will have bestowed in manner and form following, that is to
say, every Sunday during the space of ii. whole years next after my death xiii.
penyworth of bread, which I will have bestowed upon xiii. poor folles. viz the
halt, the lame, the blind, the sick, and such other as be most comfortless,
and not able to labor. I think it also a deed of charity, and commendable
work before God to repair the high ways, that the people may travail safly
without danger, I therefore give to the mending of the high ways about S. B.
and S. B. at H. twenty shillings to be employed by the discretion of my loving
wife, whom I do ordain and make my full Executrix. And if she refuse so to be,
then I ordain and make W. L. I. and A. my children my executors, and my very
loving friends and cosins A. B. etc. my Superuisors, charging them and every
of them in the name of GOD, as they will answer before the high Judge Christ,
at the dreadful day of doom, that they and every of them do see this my last
will diligently and faithfully fulfilled in every behalf without respect of
any person or persons whatsoever. Provided always, that if any person or
persons which shall enjoy any benefit by force of this my last will, other then
their filial portion, will not be ruled, as well in their education and
marriage, as in all o^^er lawful things concerning this my last Will by my
said Executrix: And she being dead, by my said Superuisors, or the most part of
them: And they being dead, by four of their Uncles, or other their nearest
friends and Alies indifferently elected, the same being known to be wise,
indifferent, and of good discretion: that then they, and every of them so
refusing utterly to lose all such benefit, as they or any of them might have
by force of this my last will and Testament, and the same portion or benefit so
given, then to remain to such, and as many as will be ordered and ruled, as is
before mentioned and declared. Item I bequeath unto every of my said
Superuisors for their pains taking, one Gold ring of half an ounce, with
these words graven seal wise upon the top of every the said ringes Esto fidus.
And also I will that their reasonable costs and charges be duly answered to
every one of them of my whole goods from time to time, with recompense of their
travel. Provided always, that if it shall fortune any question, ambiguitie,
or doubt to arise amongst my children, or any others clayming any benefit by
force of this my last Will, that the only exposition, determination, and
judgment thereof shall be determined and judged from time to time to the best
of my mind, and according unto the literal sense and meaning of this my last
will in every behalf, and by the exposition and discretion of my said
Superuisors, and others, as above is said and expressed, and not otherwise.
Provided always, and my full mind and determinate pleasure is, that in case my
next heir male, or any the heirs males of his body lawfully begotten, and
likewise my sons W. and L. or the issue male of any of them to whom my said
lands shall descend and come, do seek any mean or advantage by law or other
fraud to convey, sell, alien, or otherwise to make any estate whatsoever,
contrary to the true meaning of this my said last Will and Testament, to
defeat, or disinherite any of his or their other brethren, and the heirs males
of their bodies lawfully begotten, or any other before recited, being their
brethren or cosins, be they either males or females, contrary to such
limitation, as in this my said will is specified and contained, and do refuse
to enter bond with good suerties, in such sort as my said son F. is to do,
then I will that all such estates as be limited to such persons so doing to be
utterly void and of none effect, and that the next heirs males to him or them
shall enter into, and quietly enjoy all my said lands and tenements whatsoever,
in manner and form before specified, and not otherwise: any act or acts done,
or to be done by my said next heir or the heirs of his body in any wise to
the contrary notwithstanding. And the like order to be in every point and
behalf truly observed by my second son, or the heirs of his body. Item, I
give to my Lord B. Lord high Treasorer of England, if he be living at the day
of my death, and the Queens Majesty justly entitled to the wardship and
marriage of my next heir twenty pounds, in consideration that my wife may
after my decease have the wardship of my said heir, and the lands descending
to the Queens Majesty in lease, during his minority, his Lordship taking
what shall best like him for her highness. And I do hereby revoke and adnul
all former Wills. In witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name, and
set my seal unto this my present last Will and Testament, the day and year
first above written, in the presence of A. B. C. D. F. L. and diverse others.

An other form of a Will.
IN the name of God, Amen. The second day of January 1592. Sect. 643.
I R. L. of etc. sick of body, but of good and perfect memory (God be

be made partaker of life everlasting, And I commend my body to the earth
whereof it is made. Item whereas I by deed indented, bearing date etc. have
infeoffed T. W. and W. W. of diverse lands and tenements in M. and B. to the
use in my last Will and Testament to be limited and appointed: My will
therefore is, that they the said T. and W. shall take the rents, issues, and
profits of the same lands and tenements yearly, by the space of xx. years now
next ensuing, and therewith pay such debts as I owe, and such Legacies as in
this my last will shall be contained, so far forth as the profits thereof will
extend. Also I give and bequeath to E. my wife forty pound^ (...) and besid^s
such part of my goods as she (by the Law) ought to have, if no legacy were
unto her given. Item, etc. to T. L. my son and heir apparent all glass and
seeling, in or about my house in M. aforesaid. Item, I will, that the residue
of my goods, and the surplusage of the profits of the said lands so conuayed

funeral expenses, and my wives third part paid and deducted) shall equally
be parted and divided amongst W. R. K. and G. my children, and such child or
children as my wife has now conceived (if she have conceived any) and the
said portions to be paid unto them when they shall accomplish the age of one
and twenty years. And if any of my said children do die before he or they
shall have received their said portion, not having any child then living, then
I will so much of his or their portion so dying as shall happen to be unpaid at
the time of his or their death, shall be paid unto the rest suruiuing. Provided
always, that if either of my said daughters be married after she shall be of
the age of sixteen years, that then the portion of her so being married,
shall be paid unto her within one half year after the said marriage. And I
will, that the said T. W. and W. W. shall have the custody of the said W. and
R. my sons and of their portions, and of the said T. L. my son and heir
apparent, and of all his lands and goods until he be of full age of one and
twenty years, and they to be brought up and ordered at their discretion, they
having reasonable allowance for the keeping of them. And I will, that my wife
shall have the custody of my said daughters, and their said portions, if
she first find such sufficient security to be so bound in the double value
of their said portions, unto the said T. W. and W. W. as they shall accept and
like of for the payment of their said portions accordingly, and if they do
find no such suerties, that then she to have for the keeping of either of
them forty shillinges by year. and the said T. W. and W. W. to have the

In the name of God. Amen. The seventh day of etc. And in the year etc. I. F.
R. do make and declare this my last Will and testament in writing, reuoking
thereby both in deed and in law all other former wills and testaments. First I
commend my soul into the hands of Almighty God etc. Touching my lands,
tenements, and hereditaments where I have heretofore by my several conueyances
for thaduancement of my younger sons P. G. R. and F. the younger assured my
manors of H. B. and H. in the county of Y. And all my lands, tenements and
hereditaments in H. B. D. H. and B. in the said County of Y. to such several
uses and intents, as in and by the said several conueyances are expressed: My
will and meaning is, that the same assurances shall stand and be effectual to
the benefit of my said children, according to the true intent and meaning set
down in the same writings. And I do by this my last will ratify and
confirm, and further do will and devise all the said Manors, lands,
tenements, and hereditaments to my said sons severally, and for such and the
same estates to them particulerly and singulerly as be mentioned and limited by
the said conueyances. And where in the assurance and morgage concluded between
me and T. N. gen t^, I have put my faithful servant T. B. and R. C. in
trust, my will and request is to them that they do perform and accomplish the
same trust, and do make over such estate and interest as they have by the said
conueyance to my son G. R. and to his heirs males of his body according to
my true intent and meaning, whereunto I have made them pretty: for my full and
plain meaning is, that seeing the said G. is my first and eldest son by my
late wife M. that therefore he shall be remembered and rewarded as a secondarie
eldest son, and therefore shall have to him, and to the heirs males of his
body, my said Manors of H. and B. and all my lands, tenementes, and
hereditaments in H. B. and D. Notwithstanding my meacute;aning is, and so I do
hereby will and devise, that his two younger brethren R. and F. may have and
enjoy the same severally during their lives either of them forty pound of etc.
by the year. And that he the said G. do see the same paid according to my
said conueyance. And I do further give unto my said son G. all those
Statutes, Recognisances, and bonds, that the said M. N. and Sir H. K. have made
and knowledged to me, or to any to my use for the performance of those bargains
that be past between us, and I will that the same bonds may besued in the name
of my Executors but to the benefit of my said son G. and of his heirs
males. And if the said M. N. do pay the said sum of etc. agreed upon, and
thereby do redeem his said lands and inheritance in B. Then I do give and
devise that my said son G. R. shall have the said sum of etc. to his use
and benefit. Also I do give unto my said Son P. R. all my goods and
chattels, stock and household stuff whatsoever that shall be and remain at
H. aforesaid at the time of my decease. And I do further give unto the said
P. the one half and moitie of all the Lead that shall be owing me at the time
of my decease. And also the half benefit and forfaiture of all such bonds as
any person or persons shall stand bound to me in for the delivery of any lead
or lead ore. And where I of very fatherly love, and the rather thereby to
allure him to his book and study, did assure to my son F. the elder by my
first Wife, all that my manor of B. with the appurtenances, and my park and
new builded house there, since which time I have bin urged by the great unto
wardnesse of my said son (I will not use any more bitter words) to revoke and
make void the said assurance, and now have given the said manor of B. to I.
R. my eldest son, as by the writing thereof appears, in which reuokation I
do protest before God I do not know any manner of defect or scruple
whatsoever, yet waying that Durum telum est necessitas, and that Homo peruersus
sussitar lites, and lastly, that the desire of such a House and Inheritance
joined with any imagined title, will neither regard fatherly admonition, nor
brotherly affection: And to the intent also the said F. my son may have some
thing to maintain himself, and apply his book withal, if it please God that
he may look back and call himself to an ordinary course of life, I do
therefore for these respects give and devise to my said son F. the elder,
those two rent charges of twenty pound a piece, amounting in the whole to 50.
l. per annum, which I have going forth severally of the lands and inheritance
of T. L. Esquire, and W. R. Esquire. To have and to hold to him for and during his
natural life. And my will is further, that if the said F. my son do give
himself to the study of the common laws of this realm, whereunto I know he
has an aptness by nature although through evil behavior and worse company
he has showed himself unapt heretofore, and do become either Reader in
Chauncerie or in Court being called thereunto orderly, and performing the same
with good liking and opinion of the house, and in proof thereof shall have it so
signified under the hands and seals of four Readers of Grayes Inn for the
time being: Then I will and devise the said two rent charges of xx. l. to the
said F. R. and to his heirs for ever. And I do then also and not before
devise unto him the Statutes, recognisances and bonds, which I have severally
of the said M. L. and M. R. for the payment and several assurance of the said
two rent charges or annual payment, and the benefit and forfaiture which shall
grow or be by reason of the not paying thereof, or by any other default
committed by them or eitherus, of them, their heirs or assigns. Provided
always that my said son F. do within one half year next after my death,
if he shall not make the same in my life time, release unto my said son I.
R. and to his heirs for ever, all his right and title that he has or may
claim to have in the said manor of B. and in or to the said lands, tenements,
and hereditaments of the park and new builded house in B. aforesaid, or into
any the hamlets or villages adjoining thereunto, with warranty to be therein
contained against him and his heirs for ever: And upon condition also, that
he the said F. has not charged or encumbered the said manor and premises in B.
aforesaid or any part thereof, with any rent charge or lease whatsoever before
the said release, where about three years past, I did in the name and behalf
of my daughter K. and for her better preferment, concluded and agreed with M.
F. now deceased, for the payment of etc. to my said daughter in the space of
etc. as by the writings thereof appear, of which said payment the executrix of
the said M. F. has well and truly paid unto my hands, to the use of my said
Daughter the sum of etc. due at the feast of etc. last past, my will is, that
if the said sum of etc. be not by me answered to my said Daughter in my life
time: That then the same shall presently be paid unto her by my executor after
my decease. And my will is further, that if my said Daughter K. cannot lawfully
by order of Law recover and obtain the said sum of etc. residue of the
entire sum of etc. that then she shall be paid and satisfied of the said
sum of etc. or of so much thereof as she cannot recover of the lands or goods
of the said master F. or at the hands of his executrix or administrators by my
Executor, the same payment to be made within etc. after my death. And moreover
I give unto my said Daughter an hundred Marks, of etc. to make up her full and
whole portion to the sum of etc. And also I do give unto her the Chein of
gold that she commonly wears, and all her Jewels of gold, together with her
late mothers Bracelets of gold, notwithstanding my meaningis, that if my
executor ^o pay unto her the said sum of etc. or so much thereof as she shall
or may not recover or obtain as is aforesaid, that then my said Daughter, do
assign or set over the bonds and assurance made unto her by the said Master F.
unto the said executor or his assigns, that to the end that he may then take
the advantage and benefit thereof: for like as mine intentis, that my said
daughter should be justly satisfied of the said five hundred pound, either by
the heirs and Executrix of the said F. or else in default thereof by mine own
Executor, even so my meaning is, not that my said daughter be double paid the
said sum, I do give unto my Daughter T. over and besides the sum of etc.
which to her is assured by my self and my son I. R. by conueyance in my life
time the sum of etc. when she comes to the age of etc. or be married,
together with her Jewels of Gold, and little Chein of gold which was her
Mothers. And where I have concluded with R. T. Esquire, for a Marriage (by the
grace of God) to be had between his son R. T. and my daughter E. my Will is,
that if the said marriage do not take effect, that then my said daughter E.
shall take the benefit of all such Bonds and Recognisances as the said Master
T. has made or knowledged to me: And that my Executor do not only suffer his
name to be used for recovery thereof to the use of my said Daughter, but that
he also and his assigns do to his and their uttermost endeavor aid and
assist my said Daughter for the obtaining of the benefit and forfaiture of the
said Bonds and Recognisances to her own use. Provided always, that my said
daughter E. nor any for her, or in her name, do challenge or claim any title
or interest, in, or to the sum of four hundred pound which I did convey unto
her, to be paid of certain rent charges, which I appointed for that purpose
before the said conclusion of Marriage: for my meaning is, that seeing I have
well and truly paid unto the said T. the sum of etc. in consideration of the
said Marriage to be had that the benefit that shall come to my said daughter by
the said marriage, or by the bonds or covenants thereupon concluded shall serve
her for her portion and advancement, and that she shall not take or challenge
any other sum or portion of my goods or gift whatsoever, where I together
with my eldest son I. R. have provided that my four youngest Daughters, to
wit, A. C. I. and B. be every one of them paid the sum of etc. for their
advancement in marriage, at such days and times, as by the writings thereof
are expressed: my meaning is, and so I do will and bequeath, that my said
Daughters be justly and duly satisfied their said porcions, in such manner and
form, as by the said writings is appointed. And my will is further, that my
said youngest Daughters shall every of them be brought up at my houses at W. or
B. at the costs of my eldest son, if they be disposed to remain there
until such time as they be severally well and truly paid and answered their
said porcions. I will that within one half year next after my death there be
provided by my Executor one Chein of gold of the value of etc. which Chein I do
give to my Daughter B. And I do heartily require and charge her, that she cause
the same after her decease to be bestowed upon her son and mine N. B. I do
will and devise the yearly rent charge of etc. which I have to me and mine
heirs assured forth of the lands and Inheritance of A. E. gentleman, and the
yearly sum of etc. to be taken forth of the manor of E. in the whole per
annum twenty pound, to be employed for ever for the maintenance of the new
exected Grammar Schole at S. the finding of two Schollerships in Saint John's in
Cambridge, and the relief of the poor, hurt, and maimed Soldiers, which
shall be sent to the wars out of the Towneships of S. B. and E. in the
County of D. that is, eight pound by the year toward the same Schole, other
eight pound per annum for the said Schollerships, and four pound yearly for
the relief and succor of the said Soldiers. And now upon great good hope and
fatherly affiance that I have, and trust to find in my eldest son I. R.
toward his Brethren and Sisters, I do make and ordain him my sole and only
executor of this my last Will and Testament, and I say unto him and by him to
call the residue of my children, as Solomon said to his son, Fili mi time
Deum and Regem, and in any wise beware that you live not above your living, and
especially in the beginning, for that will bring you to want and necessity,
both in the mids and the ending.

A good President for a Testament.
IN the name of God Amen. The 21. day of the month of M. the Sect. 645.
year of our Lord God etc. I. R. M. Mercer and Citizen of L. being of whole
mind, etc. as before. First I commend my soul unto almighty God my maker and
redeemer, and my body to be buried in the Parish Church or Churchyard of Saint
N. in the City of London. Item I give toward the reparation of the same Church
xiii. s. iiii. d. Item I will that all such debts and duties as I owe of right
or of conscience to any person or persons, be well and truly contented and
paid by mine executors hereafter named, or else ordain so for to be paid
without any delay or contradiction. And after my debtes paid, and my funeral
expenses performed, I will that all my goods, cattels, and debts shall be
divided into three equal parts, whereof I will that A. my wife shall have one
equal part to her own proper use, in the name of her purparty and reasonable
part to her of all my said goods, cattels, and debts, after the laudable
custom of the City of London belonging. And the second equal part of all my
said goods, cattels and debts whatsoever, I bequeath to E and M. my daughters,
and to the child now being in the womb of my said wife equally to be
divided amongst them, and to be delivered unto them when they shall accomplish
and come to their lawful ages of xxi. years, or else be married etc. And if it
fortune any of my said children to decease before they accomplish their said
ages, and before that time be not married: That then I bequeath her part or
his part of them so deceasing, to the other of them then suruiuing, to be
delivered unto them when they shall accomplish their said ages of xxi. years,
or else be married. And if it fortune all my said children to decease (as God it
defend) before they accomplish their said ages and before that time be not
married: Then I bequeath as well all and singular the said part and portion of
my said children in my foresaid goods, cattels and debts, as also my legacies
to them hereafter bequeathed, to and amongst the children lawfully begotten of
the body of R. M. of S. in the County of K. to be paid and delivered unto
them at like ages, and in like manner as is appointed unto mine own children,
and every child likewise to be others heir thereof. And if it shall fortune
all the children of the said R. M. of his body lawfully begotten to decease
(which God defend) before they come to their lawful ages, and before that time
be not married: Then I will that all their said parts and portions of my said
goods, cattels and debts, shall wholly be employed and bestowed in amending
and repayring of high noyous ways nigh about the City of London, and to the
marriage of poor maidens, by the discretion of mine executors and overseers,
if they be then living, or else by the discretion of the L. Mayor and his
brethren the Aldermen of the City of London. And the third equal part of all
my said goods, cattels, and debts, I reserve unto mine executors, therewith to
perform my legacies and bequeasts hereafter specified, that is to wit etc. The
residue of all my goods, cattels and debts, after my debts be paid, my funeral
expenses performed, and these my legacies contained in this my present
Testament fulfilled, I wholly give and bequeath to my said children equally to
be divided amongst them, and to be delivered to them according as I have above
willed and declared. Provided always, and it is my very will, mind, and
intent, that shortly after my decease, all and singular my wares, stuff of
household, plate, and all other my goods whatsoever they be, shall be prized by
two indifferent persons, to be named and sworn by the L. Mayor of L. and his
Brethren for the time being, and all and singular the portions thereof
appertaining to my said children, as well my second part, as my said legacy so
to them made and bequeathed of my part immediately after the apprising, to be
ordered according to the custom of the Orphanage of the City of L. by the L.
Mayor and his Brethren. Item I will that the young men being free of the
fellowship of Mercers of L. shall have the occupying of all my said childrens
porcions and legacies during their nonages, they putting in sufficient suerties
therefore, according to the said custom of the City of L. And I will, and my
mind and intent is, that master H. L. and master R. M. or their assigns,
shall have the keeping, governance, and bringing up of my said children during
their nonages. And of this my present testament I make and ordain the said A.
my wife, and the said M. H. and R. mine executors. And I bequeath to every of
them for their labor in that behalf xx. li. and a black gown. And of the
execution of the same I make and ordain W. P. ouerseer, and I utterly revoke
and adnull all and every other former Testaments, wills, legacies, bequeasts,
executors, and overseers, by me in any wise before this time named, willed, and
bequeathed. These being witnesses.

Memorandum that Testaments nuncupatiue are made by word only before
witnesses, in form above said.

A clause of a Will.
ANd if it shall happen at any time hereafter any ambiguitie, Sect. 646.
doubt, or question to grow or arise by reason of thimperfection or defect, of,
or in any the word and clauses or sentences in this my present last will and
testament, or my true intent and meaning there: That then the further and
better explanation, interpretation, and construction of the said doubt and
ambiguitie, I will that my said Executors shall expound, explane, and interpret
according to their wisdoms and good discretions.

A prouiso to bind lands by will.
Provided always, and my further will is, that if either of my Sect. 647.
said sons, or the heirs of either of them do attempt or go about to do any
act or acts, thing or things to alien and discontinue the said lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, or any part or parcel thereof, to them, either
or any of them by me given and bequeathed in manner and form aforesaid, either
by feoffement, fine, recovery, or otherwise by any ways or means, so that
the same lands etc. and every part and parcel thereof cannot or may not
descend, come, remain, reuert, and be in manner and form before in this my
will limited, declared, and appointed, and according to the true intent and
meaning of this my gift, will, and last testament: That then immediately and
from thenceforth the estate, interest, and title of him or them so attempting,
doing, or going about any such act or acts, thing or things, as is aforesaid,
of, and in the said lands etc. shall cease and be clearly determined and
extinguished, and that then immediately and from thenceforth the same shall
remain, and be to such person and persons, as by this my will is limited and
appointed, in such manner and form, and upon the like condition or conditions,
as though he or they so attempting or going about any such act or acts, thing
or things, in form aforesaid, were dead in deed, any thing before in this my
present last will mentioned or declare to the contrary notwithstanding, leases
for xxi. years at the most and under, or for one, ii. or iii. lives whereupon
the old, ancient, and accustomed yearly rent, or the value thereof or more
shall be reserved and assured to such person or persons, as shall or ought to
have had the same estate or estates. Also the estate or estates that hereafter
shall fortune to be made, to, or for the iointure or iointures of such as shall
fortune to be the wife or wives of the said R. and G. or of the heirs of their
two bodies, or of the heirs of the body of either of them lawfully begotten
for term of the life or lives of such wife or wives only excepted and
foreprised.

A Codicill or scedule before the making of a Testament.
I A. B. by the grace of God, sound in mind and body, praised be almighty
Sect. 648.
God, in these codicils or scedules, do dispose my last will as touching my
goods, as follows: that is to say, First I give to E. my wife in recompense
of her thirds or reasonable portion of my goods, one hundredth pounds, and two
of my best Geldinges, and two of my best beds fully furnished. Item I give to
every one of my Sons ten pounds, and to every one of my Daughters twenty
pounds etc. As legacies be bequeathed in last wills. And my will is, that
this Codicil or scedule be and be adjudged and taken to be parcel of my last
will, and to be of force by the right of a Codicil, or by any other right, in
the best manner that may be. And I heartily require mine Executors, if God give
me leave to make a Testament, and in default thereof, mine Administrators, that
they do cause all things in this scedule or codicil contained, to be faithfully
performed, according to my true meaning, as if the same were so declared and
set down in my last Will and Testament. In witness whereof to this present
Codicill I have subscribed my name.

A Codicill made after a Testament or last Will.
BE it known that whereas I A. B. made my last will and Testament Sect. 649.
in writing (if it be written, and if not, nuncupatiue) bearing date etc. that
now for so much as I have changed my mind touching certain things in the same
last will contained. And for and concerning all other things in the said last
will mentioned (other then such as I shall not hereby otherwise dispose of) I
do by this present Codicill confirm and ratify the said last Will, And first
whereas by my said last Will I did give unto R. D. twenty pounds, my will now
is, that he shall have but only ten pounds thereof. And whereas I devised to
G. S. all my estate in one farm called W. in D. etc. which I hold by lease of
M. B. for one and twenty years, my will is, that he have it only during
tenue of the first years of the said term, and that Elizabeth my daughter
shall have the residue of the said term of xxi. years toward her preferment
in marriage etc. And so of any other Legacy, adding, diminishing, or clean
distroying the same, or gyuing new Legacies, with this clause in the end: And
my will is etc. vt supra in Codicillo ante testamentum.

And it is to be noted, that a subsequent Testament must make mention of a
precedent Codicill. And subsequent Codicils must make mention of Testaments and
of Codicils precedent if any be: For one person may make but only one last
will, but as many Codicils as he will. And Codicils may be made withany
Testament, either precedent or subsequent.

Thus much of Testaments, Codicils, and Letters of Administration.

An Inuentarie.
AN Inventory is a description or Repertorie orderly made of Sect. 654.
all dead men's goods and chattels prized by four credible men, or more, which
every Executor and Administrator ought to exhibit to the Ordinary, at such
time as he shall appoint the same. And Inuentaries ought to be made so soon as
conveniently may be after the parties death, least the goods be imbesiled, and
for the most part they are made thus:

The Inuentarie of the goods and cattels of A. B. of D. in the County of C.
yeoman deceased, made and proved by C. D. E. F. G. H. and I. K. the second day
of May, in the xxxvi. year of the reign of our Soueraigue Queen Elizabeth
etc. 1594.

Inprimis, in ready Money. x.l. His Apparel. xl. s^. Item in his bed Chamber
two standing beds with testors. iiii. l. Item four Fetherbeds, and one down
bed. x. l. Item fowerteene Blankets xxx. s^. Item eight pair of Sheets. xl.
s^. Item six Couerlets, and two Couerings. vii. l.
In like manner every thing, as woollen, linen, wine, oil, beer, ale, corn,
and grain, hey, wool, flax, wood, coals, iron, lead, household stuff of all
sorts: as tables, hangings, chaires, cushions, chestes, pots, pannes, pewter
vessel, brewing vessels, implements of husbandry, leases, debts due to the
dead man, or by him due to any other, corn upon the ground, horses, oxen,
kine, sheep, swine, pullen etc. And for the household stuff either to set
down what is in every several room: as every parler, chamber, study, shop,
buttery, seller, panterie, hall, deirie, kitchyn, brewhouse, backhouse,
laundrie, barn, s^able, oxehouse, cowhouse, doouehouse, staughterhouse,
milkehouse, and every other house. Or else (which seems better) to sort all
things of one kind together: as all brass together, all pewer, together, all
bedding together etc. prising every thing severally by it self. And then to
subscribe the same Inuentarie with the names of the same praisers, in the
presence of sufficient witnesses. And this ought to be done with great
diligence, care, and sincerity, that the true value of eurry thing may be
known, to the end that the ^a^ man's children or kinsfolks, his legatories and
creditors may have their own, without such fraudulent concealing, as in like
cases is daily committed.

Per nos A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H.
