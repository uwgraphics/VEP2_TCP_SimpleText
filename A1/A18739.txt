A greatter thanks, for Churchyardes welcome home.
I Bad not Court farewell
for such hot welcome home,
But glad to leave the costly Court
and live like cuntrye mome.
From thence I wyllyng went:
and thought in very deed,
To make (ere mischeefs fell on heaps)
a Virtue of a need.
But my cheeff friend came there,
to whom for duties sake
I rode, and did (by destinies lot)
a further journey make.
Which friend drew me by love,
to see the Court again:
But sens my suddayn coming there
does breed in you disdain:
I find more fumish flames,
by this fond frantike smoke:
And see (perhaps) a further fire,
then you with craft can cloak.
But till your fyngers burn,
ye care not what ye do:
Well, I will help to kyndle coals,
and clap on faggots toe.
To bring your hands in heat,
because the air is cold:
Ka. me: Knave thee: I say no more,
the proverb is full old.
If Crows of Cheap cry Ka,
the bawle does back rebound:
For sure I owe not all their town,
the half of twenty pound.
And thyrteene candels great,
o every pound allow:
Then call an audite of my debt,
and cast my charges now.
Yet know I cut tayld Curres,
can never byght in frame:
Till courage claps them on the backs
and thrusts them on the game.
Come on you snarryng whelps
I fear your force no whit:
Though loud ye bark ye dare not byte
your teeth are tender yet.
Baight me like Bull at stake,
I have good flesh and bone:
To try it out (as hap shall serve)
with any Dog a lone.
No other answer sure,
I make: now skan this well:
But leave the Lob that rayld on me,
the babble and the bell.
*Write not to this again,
in silence shall ye sit:
As void of answer every way,
as you are void of wit.
FINIS.
(quod) plain Churchyard.

dwelling in Paul's churchyard, at the sign of the Kings head.
