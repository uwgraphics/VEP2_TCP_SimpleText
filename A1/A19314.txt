In casting a laughter amerous
Than with a praty smyle she does me larde
And that makes me sumwhat Joyous
But coming to a bed delycyous
For to hold the spear in a full hand
It plyeth and fails for it will not stand
When I herd her babble and langage
Her gentle terms spoken so properly
I do me wysshe for to be in to the age
Of eyghten / neyntene / or four and twenty
Such assawtes than give would I
That for it she should have no need to crave
Of the great pleasure that she should have
If that she go to banckettes and daunces
She does none offense therein certain
Needs she must have her plesaunces
In some place to make her glad and feign
Wherefore I dare well say and sustain
That after with me I would have her led
If any sooner I had been to her wedde
We twain should have all our yongenesse
After marriage custom and right
Passed in Joy / solace / and gladness
And is wherefore I have me pyght
Force it is ^o me that the fire be night
That at a need I can not have qu^nched
To late married is for to be complained

Unto her the which well does him tend
Who will to household comprehend

He shall have honor in his old days
Some children unto the courts hauntes

Some hau^teth markettes and be marchu^tes
Byenge and selling their marchan^dyses
Or else constytued in offices
Their faders and moders have great solace
That to late married by no way hase
I ^^wayll the time that is so spent
That I (...) hasted for to wedde
For I shall have heritage and rent
Both gold and silver and great kynred
But such that our lord has or deyned
That I this sacrament take me upon
I will ^e^eit ^ewely at all season
Theophrastus us shows in his prose
That in marriage all is out of tune
So both also the romanute of the rose
Composed by master Ioha^ de mehune
Yet nevertheless it is all comune
That they never were in bond of marriage
Wherefore at all a ventures is their langage
