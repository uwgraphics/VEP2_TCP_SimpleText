The preface.
All the whole company of them which at Argentoratum do preche and teach
Christ /
unto the good and godly reders do wyssh grace.
Because our most noble and also most godly Senators did perceive / that
the offensyons and manyfolde euyls / which have been hitherto by the reason of
pyctures and images / ar not suffyciently taken away by the only exhortacyons
of prechers. And again did consydre / that it was not possible for any man to
decree or command any thing concerning them more wisely / than god had
prescrybed and commanded in his law and prophets: They decreed and ordained
and gave forth a commandment / that whatsoever pycture or images has been
wont to be worshypped in holy places / should both they and their aulters be
clean taken away / and avoided out of sight. Because.iiii. years ago / they had
abrogated private masses / and a tweluemoneth a go four common and open
masses. For first co^sultatyon and delyberatyon of more pure ceremonies to be
brought into their places. Secondarily they lokinge for certain counsels and
assembles / of which it was hoped / that some what should be decreed
concerning the general reformation of ye church. And thyrdly the wekenesse of
certain parsones / which could not yet se / how great impyetie and abusyon is
in masses / had saved the resydewe of masses. And they had suspended them
upon this condityon / that if any man could prove by the scryptures / that
they were not contrary to Christ / they should be restored again euerione.

Moreover / seeing there are many men / which do not yet perceive nor know /
how much these things do hyndre faith and true godly living: we do easily
conjecture / that there are not a few / which shall account this deed of
our common well / to be a folysshe and a wicked presumption. And therefore /
for as much as it is the duty of all christen men / as much as in them lies
to give dilygence and to provide / that the thing which they have godly done
and wrought / may be accounted and known of other men / to be none other wise
than godly done. And also to take good head / that no man may have occasyon
worthily to speak evil of their goodness (as Paul says) Herefore we have
judged it to be our part and duty which taught that the thing ought to be
done / which now our senate has done in very deed / and brought to pass very
dilygently to show the cause of all this whole deed: but with as much
brefenesse as may be / that if it would be / we might happily pacify and
apease the minds / at the lest wise of some persons / whom this business has
troubled and greatly disconte^ted / and doubtelesse if we may optayn this one
thing (which is denied to no man / be he never so great a malefactor) that we
may have the one ear open to here what we shall say: We fear not / but that
whosoever can find in their hertes / and abide to know these few things /
which we shall allege first out of holy scriptures. Secondarily of the
writings of the fathers. And thyrdly of the decrees of emperors against
pyctures and images. If it be showed also of whom / and for what cause and
consyderation both they were first brought up in the churches of christen men /
and also being defended have continued in the same. We doubt not (I say) but
that all such persons: if it be so / that it be granted unto them to know
the truth / will also desire with us / that this thing which is done here
with us / all other churches of christen men / did follow and execute in like
manner. Therefore we pray and beseech all those / whosoever ca^ not yet like nor
allow this our example (which thing it is no merueyle though it happen to
many men / if a man consydre what things have euerywhere gotten strength
among Christen men) that they will vouchesafe to read this short little
treatise to the end / which first was made in our maternall tongue / and now
by our most well-beloved brother / James Bedrote / is translated into laten. But
let them first before they begin to read / call for the spyrite of Christ /
which only ledeth into all verytie and truth / and that done let them than give
sentence of us. Christ the savior of mankind grant to all those which bear
his name / grace to reiecte all such thiges which do call away the mind from
him: that they may lift up their minds unto him sitting in heaven / and
worship the father by him / in spirit and truth. Amen.

That images wont to be worshipped / ar not to be suffered in the churches of
Christen men.
ALbeit / there are very many causes / which might suffycyently satisfy the
minds of christen me^ / and persuade them to take away images out of their
churches: yet no man will deny this cause to be without dout chief and
princypall / because it is forbidden in the first of gods commandments /
that any manner of images should be had among his people. For thus we read in
the scripture: Ex. 20
I am that everlasting god. I am thy god which have delivered the from Egypt /
the house of thraldom and bondage. Thou shall have no strange gods besides
me. Thou shall make unto thy self no graven or caruen image / nor the
symilytude of any manner thing which is above in heaven or beneth in the earth:
nor of those things which are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not
bow thy self before them / neither worship them: For I am thy lord god
everlasting / strong / and mighty / punysshynge the fautes of the fathers in
the children / even unto the third generatyon of the^ which do hate me. and
powringe forth my goodness / even unto the thousanth generation of them which
do love me / and do observe and keep my commandments. Lo / here are.ii.
laws of the lord set forth unto the which natte without good cause among
other / do challenge unto them selves the first place. The first of them
requires of us / that we do take this eternal and ever being god (so as he
is in very deed) for our god. The later does not only forbid strange gods /
but also it forbyddeth both the images of them / and also of all other things
/ to be had among the people of god / unto which people doutlesse / that is
to wit unto all true beleuers / all such manner precepts do apperteyne. For
these ar the true Israelyties / as it appears in the scryptures. Romans 2
iiii.ix. Gala. 3 iiij.
For Christ came not to break the law: but to fulfill it first of any man.
Now in very deed they ar annexed to the law of god / and also enclosed and
contained in it / whatsoever things do bri^ge any cause or occasyon unto the
love of god or of the neighbor / to show or put forth it self more and more.

In deed god commanded very many things to his old people which were
greatly auaylable and helping to the princypall point and end of his law.
But after that christ was ones exalted to the right hand of his father / and
the holighost was sent all abroad into the world / we are delivered and free
from a great part of such manner legal ceremonies. As for example it was
gods will and commandment / that the Jews should live together by them
selves / abstaynyng from companyeng and dealing with the ge^tyles (for he did
not yet vouchesafe that they should have knowledge of his doctrine) to thente^t /
no dout of it / that they should by somoche / be the more obedyent to his
commandment / by how much they were the less corrupted and infected with
the company of the gentyls / worshippyng false gods. But after that / the
wall which departed the one people from the other was thrown down / and both
the gentyls and also the Jews grew together in to one people. This law
which forfended the Israelytes / co^panyenge with the gentyls / could do no
service nor profit at all. wherefore it was conuenyent that it should be
abrogated. Such another like thing is cyrcumcysyon / and also the rytes and
ceremonies of purifycations / the choice of metes / the diuersyties of places
and persons / and whatsoever besides these is red to have been commanded in
the old law / concerning outward sacryfyces. For these things in as much
as neither faith nor charytie does now require them: it shall be lawful and
free for us either to observe and keep them / orels to leave them undone. For
the true honor and worshippynge of god / which has been by the prechynge of
the Apostels indifferently publysshed to the whole world / will in nowyse
suffer it self to be thruste so narowly into such manner streyghtes of places
/ days / meats / and persons.

But as concerning images / the thing is far other wise: For these being
ones forbidden must needs stand always still forbidden / specially for this
cause. Because the true honoring of god can not be but either mynisshed / or
else diverse ways let: as soon as we shall suffer the said images /
contrary to the commandment of god in churches / or in other places / where
they be honored or else may be honored. For substancyall and parfyte faith /
and the parfyte honoring of god requires / that we should do our dilyge^ce to
cause this only god to be known in all places / that we should dread and
honor him: that we should in all places and at all times with full mouth /
praise and magnify the works of him alone. But images ar so far from
helping unto this thing / that the same do diverse ways hyndre and let every
man from the true honoring of god. For who is he (I beseech you) whom images
set up in churches / or in other more narowe places / have not rather made
neglygent about the true honoring of god / than helped him any whyt to
honor god trewly. Ye / moreover (if it be lawful to speak the truth) the
true honor of god / being subverted and overthrown / they have quite blotted
out of men's minds the remembrance of those things / for whose cause it is
feigned / that they were first set up. And though it be so / that otherwhyles
peradventure by the occasyon of these godly admonytours / some thought and
remembrance of god does come into our mind: yet the same thought is sooner
vanysshed away / tha^ that it can gether sufficient rotes in the breasts or
minds of men. For as it is but a thing of ma^s deuisyng / and received without
the commandment of god: even so was it never able to move or stere our
hertes and minds with the quycke and lively perceiving / either of the works
or of the benefytes of god. By the reason of which thing it has come to pass
/ that no place has been left to the lively admonition / which is by the
creatures of god: not withsta^dinge that these said creatures / because in all
places we do se them / and handell them / ought also in all places to styre up
and renew in us the remembrance of gods infynite goodness. Brefly / there
is no cause / why we may more rightfully impute / shall I say or negligence /
or else our contempt toward the true honor which is acceptable to god /
unto any other thing than unto images. For after that these began to be
worshipped in certain places / forthwith flowed in an unmeasurable see of all
euyls. For though we pass over / that god by the reason hereof / was many ways
grievously offended and displeased / because contrary to his open and euydent
commandment / not only we have worshipped the^ / but also puttyng our trust
in such manner worshippinge have persuaded unto our selves / yt herewith we do
win to our selves the favor of god / and trustyng unto these vain and
tryflynge works / have either utterly not minded / or at the lestwyse / have
lothsomly and disdaynefully done those works / with which only a christen
mind may be pleasynge and acceptable to god. And who is he but he knows that
by the reason hereof / very many men have been so tycked with a merueylouse vain
hope / to get of the lord I wot not what great hepes and treasures of merits:
that if they had not thought these manner tryfles to be most acceptable to god.
Not the goddess Pitho herself / Pitho the goddess of eloquence
with all her sweet eloquence / should have been able to bring the^ in mind /
being slow enough / and to much unto all other works of charity besides / to
have pleasure to lasshe out so great richesse / partly upon the making and
partly upon the payntynge / gyldynge / or otherwise garnysshynge and deckynge
of images.

Besides all this / I say (which is a thing more to be sorowed for) this vain
honoring of images has engendered such a confydence and trust in a great
sort of men / that those works which are in very deed good and godly / laid
clean a side: they have taken occasyon to live a great dele the more at large
and more lycentiously / because they are persuaded and in steadfast belefe / that
with these works they have so gotten the favor of god / that at all other
sins and vyciouse living / he does wynke and will not se them / and as
though having liberty granted to sin unpunished / they might give
themselves at large to all manner vices / even as they list themselves. If this
thing were not well enough known unto all men by experyence: we could prove
it with such manner examples and proufes / that even he that were blind /
should perceive plainly / that there has not lyghtely any other more perilouse
mischefe cropen into the church / tha^ this of honourynge images.

Who is he than / that does not here somewhat smell and perceive the false wyly
crafts of our old enemy / which has never cessed to drive the world unto
such madness / that putting away the true honor of god / men should receive
and embrace this honor / which makes them to go the clean contrary way
from god / disceyuyng all manner men with the vain appearance and outward sight
of images / as though (god wot) men by them were put in remembrance of godly
things / when in very deed by the^ nothi^ge else has be^ brought in / but an
innumerable hepe of all euyls. Moreover / that man / who^ heaven / earth / and
whatsoever is contained in them / and most specially man / which is created to
the image of god / finally whom god him self / the worker of all these things
/ does not waken and stere up to love him and praise him: no man / unless he
be madder than a man of Bedlem / will believe that this man will be moved
greatly with deed and vnsensyble images. If so many works of god / if so many
creatures / no less profitable than merueylouse / which set the goodness of
god before thine eyes / can not inflame the / thou art doutlesse to vnsensyble
for to be admonysshed and styrred ever of vnsensyble images. The goodness of
god shines and appears in all his creatures. There is nothing / but it
expresses god himself. All ye world is full of things / which do not cesse to
put us in remembrance of our duty / that is to wit / that we should continue to
be unto other men / as god is unto us / and that we should resemble him by a
certain endless goodness. But verily that this thing has the less esely be^
brought to pass hitherto / we may thank images for a great part thereof: for
such expenses which ought to have been made upon poor nedy folk (whom as
being the very live images of god / it was conuenyent to have socoured and
made our friends with our lyberalyte) we have wastfully bestowed upon stocks
and stones. you se therefore that the true honor / and that which only is
accepted to god / has been by no other thing so much backed and hi^dred as it
has by the vain superstition of images: and that the devil by these crafts
has brought i^ the contempt of god / the ouerthrowi^g of faith a more large
liberty to do whatsoever one list unpunished / false co^fydence in merytes /
lothfulnesse to exercise charity toward our neybours: brefly in exceeding
great hepe of all manner euylles has been brought in: and to make an end / a
wyndowe opened to all manner vice and sin: which thing although it might be
esely proved by examples out of no^bre: yet at this present time let one
example of the kings of Israel suffyce. For how many so ever of those kings
thistorie of the Bible does nombre among wicked and ungodly persons / the same
kings it does record to have be^ also idolaters and worshippers of images. on
the other side again / who soever ar commended for their love and exercise of
virtue and godliness: they would give euydent testymonie and witness by
distroyenge and ryddi^g images shortly out of the way / yt they were ruled by
the holy ghost / and could not but hate all manner things / which are
abhomynable in the sight of god.

And as for that which some me^ do feign / that images are the books of lay
men. (For so they say) it is not only a weyke reason / but also a folysshe: as
who should say / that god / of all most wysest / and which is very wisdom it
self / either did not know these books / or else through malice did withhold
from his own people such manner books and monume^tes / whereby they might be put
in remembrance of godly things. Forsooth it is a wicked thing / even ones to
think / that god (which according to his goodness toward us / left none of
those things vnshewed / and as they say / poynted with his finger which might
help to further and increase the knowledge of him self / and to stir us up
also to the love of him self) I can not tell of what evil will and hatred had
kept this worshippynge of images from his own people. For not only he did not
teache the worshippinge of images / but also he did with express and plain
words utterly forbid it / as it appears euydently by the first law of all.
Now what is more unreasonable and unlikely / than if the use of images be so
profitable / as these men do feign it to be / that god did nothing esteem
them / seeing that in the mean season he had begone to tech his people /
being yet but young begi^ners / and having but small knolege with so many
outward things / even as one should enduce a child / seeing also that he would
his works and benefytes to be openly known by so many wonderful miracles /
and by so manyfolde ceremonies, besides this / did induce the people with
holidays / and other rytes innumerable. Finally left nothing behind to the
shadowing and fyguringe of himself largely unto the^. I say / how fortuned it
/ if images be so profitable / that god for all this insomoch did nothing
esteem the^ that he would in no wise suffer them to be among his people. Sith
than it is so / that it was not lauful for the people / which was yet rude and
ignorante to have any manner images / although the lord did by many other
diverse ceremonies by little and little teache and facyon the same people. How
much less shall it be lawful for us / who^ the truth succeeded in to the
place of shadows / has now made free from outward ceremonies / requyryng
non other honor or service of us / than that which stands in spirit and
truth.

Let us therefore have images / not of stone / not of wood / not graven / or
cast in any moulde (al which god has ones for ever forbidden / as well to us
/ as to the Iues) But let us rather consider the very word of god / let us
occupye and busye our selves in it both night and day: Besides this / let
all the whole frame of this world be unto us amonument and token to put us in
remembrance of god / that whatsoever true godliness is remaining in us / it
may not by the works of men / but by the works of god well and after a godly
facyon consydre / inflame and kyndle us to the praysyng and loving of hi^.

Now as touching to this reason / that some men do make for to excuse the use
of images / because (as they say) after that god taki^ge the nature of man upon
him / had vouchesafed to live among men / and to be nailed fast to the cross
/ and wylled the knowledge of him self to be egall publysshed and declared unto
all me^: there is no cause why it should not be lawful to use images / but yet
most specially of Christ crucified / to thentent that we might oftentimes be
put in remembrance / how by his death we have gotten redemptyon and saluatyon.
Verily we do not deny / whatsoever wholesome and profitable thing has come to
us by the death of Christ / which he suffryng wha^ he was co^uersaunte among
men / reconsyled ma^kinde to his father: yet that natwithsta^dyng the same
Christ did plainly witness / that his bodily presence was nothing profitable.
Ioa. vi
It is the spyrit (says he) that quyckeneth. It was therefore for our profit /
that he should bodily depart from us. Io. xvi
And for that cause after his resurrection he ascended up into heaven to the
right hand of his father / to the end that he might carry us also up to the same
place / if it be so that we have risen with him by faith. Col. iij
Besides this / when Paul / according to the same sentence / does openly
esaye / that he does no lengre know Christ / as touching the flesh: he
sygnifyeth that another manner of worshippynge is required of us / that is to
wit / a spirytuall honor and such one / which may effectually and strongly
transform our hertes / which thing sith it can not be done by the benefyte
and help of images / let us say a due for ever to these tryfelynge and
unprofitable helps / which are rather hynderers of true faith and godly living
/ tha^ monume^tes and tokens to put us in remembrance of godly things. It is
undoubtedly stark madness to desire to be put in remembrance of the benefytes
of Christ by images / when Christ him self ought to work the same in our
minds / which in us and all creatures works all things. Let us (I say)
have this Jesus nailed fast upon the cross / set up before the eyes of our
mind / as oftentimes as he tries us / and lays his cross upon us / by
pacyence of trybulations and aduersyte. Let Christ so possess and fill the
breast of a christen man / of whom he has his name / that there be no thing /
but it do put him in remembrance of his lord / the creator and maker / the
governor / and the savior / and preserver of al things. Wherefore so
oftentimes as he looks up toward the sky / he can not choose but remember
forthwith his savior Christ / which raygneth above all heuens on the right
hand of his father. As soon as he beholds the son / by and by he thinks
upon Christ the son of righteousness / and the light of the world / which
with his beams lyghteneth the heart. Wha^ he sees a man / he remembers that
Christ was made man for our sake. If he do met^ with a king or a prince / anon
Christ the king of kings / and lord of lords / is in his remembrance. When
he hereth any precher or techer / lo / straight ways his mind is upon Christ
the heavenly doctor and master: as the garment done upon the body does the
body both profit and honestye: even so does a godly mind think that Christ
is the very wedding garment / whom all those persons have done on them selves
/ how many soever have been baptized. A christen man never eteth or drinks /
but forthwith he is put in remembrance that christ is the only and the very
meat / which fedeth and nouryssheth us into eternal life. If at any time he
does occupye water / forthwith it comes to his mind / that Christ is the
fou^tayne / out of which we may draw drink against insatiable thurst. Brefly /
so oftentimes as he shall see either a sheep or a shepherde / a gate / a way /
a vynetree / or a stone / forthwith he conceyueth an image and symilytude of
his lord christ which wyllyngly suffered him self to be slain and offered up
for the reconcylyation of the world / which bosteth him self to be a good
shepherde / which is the way and the yate / by which men go and enter in to
heaven / which witnesses himself to be the true vynetre / the cornerstone /
and set for a foundatyon. Finally / if thou before vxed with aduersyte / orels
see any other man to be in afflyction and calamyte: besides this / if thou be
troubled with passions and noughtye affectyons and desires: forthwith (if there
be any percell of Christ in the) set before the eyes of thy mind / both the
death and the ressurection of Christ / and steadfastly and depely consydre the^ /
by the means whereof thou may in such wise arm and fence thy mind with
complete harness / so sure and so full of most effectual consolations / that
thou shall be able casely to abide and overcome whatsoever aduersytie shall
fall unto the. So than if after this manner and facyon we would have lust and
pleasure to learn Christ parfytely in all things / and his works with a
certain lively feeling and judgment of the mind / which should transform and
change us: without dout the love of god should be merueylously augmented in us
/ and we should also (as it were in a glass) see / with what comlynesse / and
after what manner and facyon the course of this life ought to be passed over and
brought to an end / which thing none images can ever be able to teach us.
For these (whatsoever manerons they be) can not set before thine eyes any
symilytude of god: but rather with avayne imagynation when thou wenest that
thou art warm with a certain hot love and desire / to consydre and think
upon godly things: suddenly this heat and feruentnesse vanissheth away / and
it shall make the more neglygent to all true works semely for a christen man /
tha^ ever thou wast before. We do therefore pituously disceyue our own selves
with this flyeng devotion / as they call it. For wha^ we have thought our
selves to be fed and full of the better things: we find by experyence /
sooner than we would have thought / that we have been fed with wind (as it
is said in the proverb) and that we are emptye and void of meat / which
does nourysshe and make fat in virtue and godly living.

But as for these persons / which trusting and berynge them selves bold
upon the law of christen liberty / do excuse images / saying / that for this
cause they are not unlawful / because we may use the^ lawfully at our own
pleasure / as well as we may other outward things / and therefore that it is
better yt there be images of Christ than to have images of profane things: I
would that these men should first learn / that whatsoever images are honored or
may be honored / ar not to be compted in the nombre of outward things / and
therefore they are used both to the injury of the divine majesty / which only
ought to be honored / and also to the labefactation and decay of the faith.
There is no cause therefore why the consyderation of christen lybertye / may
suffer in any wise such manner images. For the liberty of a Christen man / is
not a license to do what soever he list / but it is rather a voluntary
execution of virtuous works / which are done by the motyon of charytie / and
not by the commandment and compulsyon of the law.

Now as touching the obiectyon of some men / that there is no cause why it
may not be lawful for us to use pyctures and standing images. For likewise
as wise men / and those persons which have been suffyciently instructed in the
true doctrine and faith of Christ / ar nothing offended nor do take any hurt
by images: even so weke persons / and such as be not yet well skylled in
godly things / either when they have better instruction and are taught the
truth / shall be nothing hurt by the reason of images / or if they be sturdy
and such as will not be taught / they shall be no whyt better / though all images
were clean taken away. So than neither for the weke persons cause neither for
their cause which are parfyte / is it necessary to take away images.
Doutlesse / whosoever with such forked reasons do coueyte to defend and
maintain images: they have not very well considered nor waied the counsel
and intent of Paul / wha^ he says i Co. ix
All things ar laufull for me: but all things are not expedyent nor
profitable. All things ar laufull to me: but all things do not edyfye. And
again in another place knowledge makes a man proud / but charity does edify.
i. Co. 8
Also there is no knowledge in all men. And again: Take heed that your lybertye
be not an occasyon of offense and hurt to them which are weke. i. Co. 8
We do not say / nay verily: but that there is nothing / which lets
Images to be had / so that they be natte worshypped. j. Co. 8
We do grant also / that caruers and paynters craft / are crafts both given
by god / and also lawful. But sith it is so that in churches every were /
images are honored / and namely roodes. It is not possible though thou prech
never so often / nor never so ernestly unto the people / that images are not to
be honored: but that there will be some / which will hold on still to put of
their cappes unto the^ orels to lowte and make curtesye to them. For such is
the strength of an old rooted custom / and the devil again exercyseth and
puts forth his crafts and disceytes so busely / that they which be ones
snarled in his bonds / will never refrain from worshippinge of images, Now
both the occasyons and also the prouocations and entise me^tes of al such manner
euyls must needs be taken away / if images were ones put down. And albeit
truth it is / which they say commenly / that where this vain perswasyon of
images is not plucked out of me^nes minds by the word of god / there can not
the same be taken away neither by putting down of images: yet is it not
generally true / so that we may think it to be trewly said by all manner men
indyfferently / as much by one as by another. For by wicked men you may well
and truly say the same / which continue always like to them selves / and
change not their mind / whether thou do with words make plain the
abhomynation of images with words orels do in very deed ryd all images out
quyte of sight. But to them that are weke / and in whom there is remaining any
/ be it never so little spark of godly love and reverence: it shall not be
unprofitable nor in vain / to witness and confyrme their doctrine with their
deed / that is for to say / after that thou have discrybed and painted images
so as they ought to be with their own colors / borrowed of the scripture /
than dilyge^tly to provide / that the same also be ryd out of men's sight.
For by that deed weke men shall be confyrmed / as in other things / so likewise
in this. For thy techynge shall be all in vain \ unless the example of thy deed
do forthwith follow / which shall cause thy doctrine to be of strength and
auctoryte. Paul doutles thought it not sufficient that the Corinthians knew
j. Co. 8
an idol to be nothing: but he would also yt the same people should i^ any wise
absteyne from etynge of the meats offered to idols / and that for the weke
persons sake / to who^ full knowledge of such manner things was natte yet
given. Therefore he badde the Corinthyans to confyrme and fortifye this
doctrine with the auctoritye of their deed / and to refrain not only from
eating of the flesh offered up in sacrifyce to idols: but also from all
manner things that might appear evil / or any manner way might offend weke
persons.

i. Co. 9
For albeit he gave them leave to eat all manner flesh / even that also which
was offered to Idols / if it were sold in the flesh market: yet in the
churches where they were offered up to ydoles / he would in no wise grant
them lybertye to eat such metes.

Even like wise do we judge / that it is to be thought of images / which
likewise / as peradventure some man may have at home within his own house / so
that it be done without offendynge of his neighbor: even so the use of them
in churches or in other places / where either they may be worshypped or
offend and hurt their neighbor is no wise longer to be suffered.

Paul doutelesse had lever never eat flesh in all his life / than to give
his brother occasyon to be offended: i. Co. 8
And shall we all careless wynke at so many occasyons both of offensyons and
also of ydolatrye. Mat. v
If Christ does bid the eye to be plucked out of the heed / which is an
obstacle and impedyment to us: how much more tha^ ought pyctures and images to
be plucked out of churches / by which we do not only offend weke parsones /
but also do set forth our relygyon to be scorned and evil spoken of among
the Turks and iues which do convince us / that in this behalf we do against
the princypall points of the christen faith. Would god that with this
superstition and vain honourynge of images we did not stop and keep away a
great menye both of the jews and also of the Turks / from receyuynge and
taking of the christian faith upon them.

Now / if any man will obiecte that for the abuse (which peradventure no man
will deny) images are not altogyther to be taken aaway (for else the souper of
the lord / and baptyme / with many other things / which are encombred with
diverse abuses / ought also in like manner to be abrogated) this answer we do
make unto hi^: That christen men should not wynke at any abuse / and therefore
whatsoever is brought into the church / contrary to scripture / it is to be
amended / and to be tried by the squire and rule of gods word / if any
thing does not agree with it / it is to be cut away / with all speed that may
be. And only that thing / which is right / which is wholesome / is to be
restored to his own place / and taken in his own place / specially in the
souper of the lord / in baptyme / and other things also which have been
instytuted by the lord. But images ar all manner ways to be taken away / not
only for the abuses / but much more for the word of god / to which they are
plain contrary and repugnaunte. For we can not ymagyn any manner vtylitie /
which may be said to have come by the reason of images. On the other side /
that the superstityon of images does draw with it an hepe of all euylles: we
have here to fore declared.

To make short / god never for bad any of those things / whereof any
commodytie or profit might rise: but rather whatsoever thing is profitable /
and may make us better / he taught full largely / as witnesses Paul very
euydently.ii. Timoth. iii.

But if any folysshe wise man does think / that images ar therefore not to be
taken away / because he fereth that those weak persons / which now
supersticiously do worship / images / would be offended with the puttinge
down of images: this man doutelesse / whiles he goth about to avoid from the
smoke (as it is said in the proverb) is fallen into the flaming fire. For
whiles he fears to offend disperate persons: with hurtefull offensyons of
images / he backeth and hinders better me^ which have begone to run the
way of the lord without any tournynge again.

Who so ever does this / shall be gyltye of that crime / of which Paul
accuses Peter / in the epistle to the Galatyans. Gala 2
For Peter whiles he was afraid to offend certain Jews of Jerusalem at
Antyoche / and for that cause would natte use the lybertye of etynge all manner
meats / as he was wont to do before: Paul with stood him to his face in the
presens of the whole multitude / because he walked not the ryt way / according
to the truth of the gospel. For as much as was in him with his unwise desire
to avoid offendynge of the Jews / he febled the right faith / and also
nourysshed the incredulyte and unbelief of them / whom he studied to please in
the mean season. Brefly he did nothing else / than whiles he went about
vnwysly to avoid one ieoperdy / he cast himself into twain. Doutlesse after
this manner to desire to avoid occasyons of offensyons / is the full cause of
offensyons. And would god it were not of so great strength as it is / among
very many me^ now in these days. For a man shall se very many me^ which because
they would ymagen some honest cloak and color of their unbelief / do feign
themselves both to do and also to eschew very many things / lest they might
give any man occasyon to be offended: when in very deed, they do it rather
forcause to keep the cross of Christ from them selves. For with this feigned
desire to win certain curable persons / they shifte well for them selves /
that they may neither have the evil will of desperate persons / neitheir any
displeasure or hurt done unto them by the same* We do not deny verily / that
such manner of doctrine and living is most to be embraced and followed / which
is an obstacle or lettynge so no man / which does purposely anger no man /
which does turn no man's mind away from the truth: yet nevertheless
dilygence ought to be given in the mean season lustely / that none of those
things be left of / whereby the glory of god and the health of our neighbors
/ may be furthered and increased. Christ him self is the stone of offensyon /
the savior of death to death / unto them which are foreordeyned to life.

After that we our selves do know the will and pleasure of the lord: we
must dilygently labor that other men also may like and praise the same / and
that other men also may have lust and pleasure to confyrme them selves unto
the same / if we can not obtain this / than ought we rather to forsake father
and mother / and al our goods: ye / moreover to renounce our own selves /
than to resyst or grudge against the will and pleasure of god But most
co^munely we se it come to pass / that a great part of men have lever both to
get and to maintain and keep the favor of men with the minisshement of gods
honor: albeit yet it were better to win both the favor of god / and also of
men / with honest manners / and honest living / and with ready desire and will to
do good unto all men / if we would begin this manner of winning the favor of
me^ and in other things would live in this world fautelesse / as nere as we
could / douteles there should be no man so parcyall in judgment / but he would
by and by gather in mind / that it was neither presu^ptuouslye nor without
good cause done of us that we have banisshed pictures and images clean out of
churches. But whereto should we make many words / sith it is evident enough
now / that images do minissh the true honor of god and that it is not possible
but that weke men be greatly offended / and do take much hurt by them. For
they I mean weke persons would pass little upon the taking away of images
/ if they were taught plainly / for what consyderation and skyll they were
taken away. On the othersyde / if they be not taken away / forthwith they
conceive an opinyon / as though it were not lawful to put them away. Now as
for obstynate and incurable persons / not only we can not with saving images
bring them to goodness: but also with our sufferaunce and slacknesse we shall
confyrme and establysshe the^ the more in ydolatrye.

Brefely / if thou haste so great desire and love to win many men to thy
lord: order thy life so that other me^ may in very deed se experyence and
proof / that Christ is alive in the / and that all thy deeds and sayenges do
breath and sauoure of him. Without doubt / if thou will order thy self in
this wise / thou shall cause even wicked men also / that they can not choose /
but at the lest wise closely in their hertes confess (their conscience
dryuynge them thereunto) that thou wast not only moved / but also compelled by
the zele of god to put away images. And though in the mean season / many
things be wantynge in us: yet that natwithstandynge we ought to be
nevertheless dilygent / to provide that all such manner things be put away
/ which soever are repugnaunte to the word of god.

Let us take no thought for any manner thing / which may cast us out any
manner way of the favor of men: and let us go straight forth / and take the
next way to fulfill the rule of a Christen man's life. for a true Christen man
/ although he does in many things acknowledge him self to be a sinner (as he
is i^ very deed) yet does he neither allow nor excuse any manner thing which
does minysshe or deface the honor of his lord and master christ

Of the abuse of images we have spoken somewhat here to fore. But if any man do
somewhat dilygently consider and way the matter / he shall perceive undoubtedly /
that images ar fallen into a far gretter abuse among Christen men / than
ever was among any heathen men. Images have given answers with us / they have
wept / one of the^ has been thought more holy and of more power than another.
One more lovely and more gracious than another / a man shall find some /
which in a certain place have showed forth their power in workyng of miracles
/ when they have be^ translated and removed into another place / they have
cessed to do the same. Of the image at Lauretum / and diverse other / sith the
matter is known will inoughe: we need not to say any thing at all. And I
pray you / how much richesse in the mean season has this superstition of
images gathered together / not with out plentuouse occasyon of offensyons: which
said riches the glotony and pomp of a sort of unthrifty idle belyes has
destroyed and wastfully consumed. In as much therefore / as true / full / and
parfyte faith can not suffer so great abhominatyon / and sith it can not be
plucked up by the roots with the word alone (For with the goodly and
gloriouse apperaunce of holiness / and also by the reason of long custom and
contynuance / it has gotten so great auctoryte and estymation to it self) it
is to be put away by the deed self. And whereto needs it to suffer those
things among christen men / which as they can not but engendre euylles out
of nombre / so can they cause no hope nor lokynge of any manner profit to come
by the^ unto any man. It did become us christen men most of al to be moved and
styred with the word of god / which does so plainly and so expressly forbid
all manner of images. Whatsoever is read concerning images in the law / in
the Prophettes / in the Psalms does much more rightefully appertain unto us
/ which are taught by Christ / that god is to be worshipped in spyrite and
truth / and that Christ also is natte to be honored in Images of wood / of
stone / or of silver: but that he is to be worshypped raither sitting on the
right hand of his father / and that all the members of the said Christ / that
is to wit / our neighbors are to be focoured with deeds of charytie.

And these few things among many / it has lyked us to borowe of the
scryptures against pyctures and images / which scriptures alone / a christen
man has regard unto / as unto the shote ankre / in all things / both which
ar to be desired / and also which are to be eschewed. But yet because it can
not be but pleasure and conforte to the same Christen man / whatsoever either
doctrine or examples he shall find in the saints of god / which is co^sonant
and agreyng to the scriptures: we have thought it expedient to bring forth a
few things of the wrytynges of the fathers / by which the godly reder shall
easily perceive / that the apostles / martyrs / and all the best learned and
most ancient fathers taught the same thing / which is ordained and
commanded by the word of god / until such time as by the Gothyans and the
Vandalyanes / the christen faith and the more pure knowledge of the truth
began to be greatly minisshed and brought in decay. For in the time of saint
Hieronymie / and certain years after him / we do not read / that any bishop
being of wise judgment / did suffer pyctures or images in the churches of
christen men. Of which thing Epiphanius / the most holy bishop of
Salamine / in the isle of Cyprus shows an euydent example in his epystel to
Johan the bishop of Jerusalem / which epystel saint Hieronyme translated
into latin. For thus he writes: Epiphanius.
when we went together to the holy place which is called Bethell / to make a
collectyon there for poor people with the / accordi^ge to the custom and
manner of the church: and I was come unto the vyllage which is called Anablatha
/ and as I passed by / did se a burning lamp / and I had asked what place it
was / and had learned that it was a church / and had entered into it to pray: I
did find there a veil hanging in the church doors / colored and painted /
and having as it were the image of Christ / or of some saint (For I do not well
remember whose image it was) I say when I had seen that in the church of
Christ / there did ha^ge the image of a man against the authority of the
scriptures: I did cut it / and gave counsel rather to the kepers of that place
/ that they should wind some poor man that were deed / and bury him in it. And
they again grudgynge / said by me: If he had minded to cut it / it was
reason and right that he should give another veil and change this / which
thing when I had herd / I promised that I would give one / and send it forth
with. Howbeit I deferred the sending of it somewhat the longer / by the reason
that I intended for to send a very good veil in the sted of it / and I
thought yt I should have had one sent unto me out of Ciprus. Now I have sent
such one as I could get / and I pray you / that you will bid the priests of
that same place / to receive this veil of the bringer / which we have sent /
and afterward to command / that no mo such manner vayles / which are
contrary to our relygyon / be hangen up in the church of Christ.

Lo / here the sentence of the most virtuous bishop / in which he gives
judgment by express and plain words / that it is against scripture and our
relygion / that images of christ ar had in the churches of christen men /
whereof we may gather evidently that in this matter / both Jerome and also other
bisshops were of the same mind that Epiphanius was of. Herfore Eusebius
Eusebius
also reherseth / as a strange and an unwont thing / that in Cesarea Philippi
(in which cite the woman was borne / whom Christ healed from the flux of
blood) He did se two images of brass / the one of ye woman / the other of christ
our savior / which images yet were set up at church doors / not in the
church self / as the same Eusebius records. And at the last / he says
thus: It is no merueyle if those persons of the gentyles which did believe /
were seen for such benefytes as they had received of the savior / to offer as
you would say / such a manner reward or recompense / sith it is so that we do
see images and tables of the apostles Peter and Paul / and also of Christ our
savior to be carue^ and painted / even these days also we have seen moreover
old images of them kept of certain persons / which thing me think is
observed / according to the custom of the gentyles / without any dyfference /
because they are wont in such wise to honor them / who^ they thought worthy
of honor. For that the arms or images of old men are reserved and kept for
a remembrance to them that shall come after: it is a sign and token both of
their honor / and also of these men's love toward the^. Li. vii. ca. 14.
Thus says Eusebius in ye eccliastical histori.

Hereof we do easily perceive / that the images which Eusebius did se / were
set up / not within the churches / but at the church doors. Again / not to
thentente that they should be honored / but rather that they should be a
testymony and record how great honor they were to be judged worthy of / whose
images were reserved and kept: all which things nevertheless / Eusebius
does not hyde / to have taken their beginning of the Gentyles and hethen
people. But what think you that he would have said / if he had seen images set
up i^ churches and no less worshipped of christen men / than ever they were of
any gentyls / which thing (a lack for petye) it is undoubted both to have be
done: ye / and to be done even now at these days also. Of these things
therefore we may gather what is the cause / why the old fathers did write
nothing against such manner of images. For there was no man at that time /
which did so much as ones dreme / that ever so great a multitude of images
should crepe into churches / as has crope^ in / for as much as they knew it
to be forbidden with so open and euydent oracles and testymonyes of the
scripture. But against the images of the Gentyles / a man shall find many
things written by the fathers very co^nyngly and eloquently / because the
superstityon of the^ did raygne every where eue^ at the same time / in which
those holy me^ were living. yea / and was defended of the gentyles with the
same weapens / with which both in our time / and also in the time of our
fathers / certain christen men have gone about to defend and maintain their
images. Whatsoever thing Lactantyus wrote against the ydoles of the gentyles /
we may by very good right apply the same against our images: all beit in his
time (as we have said) they were not yet used among christian men. Lacta^tius
Among many places it lyketh me at this time to allege one. Lib. ij, cap, ij.
For thus he demau^deth of the gentyles: If you do therefore fere your gods /
because you do judge them to be in heaven: why do you not than lift up your
eyes in to heaven? why do you rather look to walls / to stocks / and stones:
than to that place / where you do believe that they be? This same question in
like manner may we demand of our superstityouse christian men: If they do
believe that god and saints ar in heaven: why do they not rather lift up
their eyes to that place / than to the deed images? But let us here also
Athanase / writing in this wise against the ge^tyls. Athanasius,
Let the^ say (I beseech you) how or after what manner god is known by images:
whether is it by the matter and stuff put round about them: or else is it by ye
shape and facion brought i^ to the stuff? If it be for the stuff of the
images that he is known / than what needs any shape or facion to be brought
in by the workman? and why did not god appear as well by all manner of stuff /
before that any images were made: sith all things do witness his glory. But
if the shape and facyon brought into the stuff / be the cause of the knowledge
of god: what needs than any payntynge / or any other stuff at all? and why is
not god known rather by the very live creatures / whose shapes or images? for
doutles the glory of god should be more clearly and euydently known / if it were
showed by the live creatures both reasonable and unreasonable / tha^ by deed and
immovable creatures. Therefore when you do grave or paynte images / for the
entente to have understanding and knowledge of god: forsooth you do an unworthy
and an unmeet thing. etc. Now Athanasius would never have purposed in his mind
/ to write any such manner thing against the gentyles / if he had seen the
christian men of his time / entangled and wrapped in such superstityon of
images / as we do se a great part of the world to be pytuously snarled now in
our time: but he would rather have exercysed his pen against christe^men / if
they had been like our christian men now adays. But nothing lets / but that
we may very accordi^gly apply ye same things against our superstityous
christen men: for they pretend the same cause of having images / with which
Athanasius reherseth / that the ge^tyles were moved / that is to wit / that by
images they may be put in remembrance of god: which thing / sith the
creatures of god (whether we do consider the stuff or the shape and facyon of
them) may do much more strongly (as Athanasius iugeth full well) there is no
need that we should run unto the works of me^ / which do represent but only
I wot not what false image unto us. For whom soever trees / stones / silver /
gold / and other stuff / whereof images are made / finally whom the sight of
man / to whom god has given life and reason / can not styre nor put in
remembrance of god: surely images shall natte styre up that man with any fruit
or profit: for they (as Origin writes against Selsus) do rather pluck away
the memory of man from god / and do turn the eyes of the mind bacwardes /
to behold and consider erthly things. For every man knows / that the more
nere that one thing resembles another in nature and propriety / so much the
more strongly it does renew the remembrance in us of that thing / to whom it
is like. For trees or stones do more surely and lively put us in remembrance
of god / when they are co^sydered of us / having their own natural shape and
facyon / so as they were first created of god: than when by the work and craft
of men being beryued of their own natural shape / they do express and
resemble unto us the image and likeness of man / or of any other thing. For
sooner shall the remembrance come to thy mind of the Caruer or Paynter / whose
workmanship thou do marueyle at / than the remembrance of god / the creator
and maker of all things. It is therefore nothing else but a pure disceyte of
the devil / which calls us from the praisynge and charytable loving of the
live images of god / unto deed images of wood or stone / which some man a
folysshe cou^terfaiter of god / has folysshlye carnen or painted. We could
also allege many other testymonyes out of the writings of the fathers: but
it should be all in vain / to recyte any mo to him which is not moved with
these / which we have all ready rehearsed.

Here we have thought it very expedyent and necessary to declare and make
plain / according to the truth of hystories / when / and by what begynners
images begane to come up among Christen men: and who again on the other side
did their endeavor to put them down / and with how much business / and how
great ieoperdy / good and well disposed men have attempted this thing until
the church was brought in to this present condityon and state of things
falling still apece to worse and worse. Undoubtedly the laws as well of the
christen emperors / as of the christen counsels / made against images / came
tha^ first forth when through the slothfulness and negligence of bysshoppes
and their vain curyouse desire to win the favor of god / not only images and
pyctures crepte into the churches / but also (which is wont comunely to
chance) they began to be worshipped of the people. We read that Serenus / the
bishop of Massilia Serenus Bishop of Massilia,
/ a very holy man / was so displeased and took it so grievously (as mete was)
that images were set up in churches: that he did cast down all the images at
ones which were in his church / did break them / and at the last did also
burn the^. We do not deny / but that this deed of Serenus was sore rebuked of
Gregory / which was called Gregorius magnus Gregorius magnus,
/ and that the seyde Serenus was admonished and cou^selled of ye seid Gregori
/ that he should not forbid or let images to be had: but that he should teache ye
honoring of the^ in any wise to be avoided. But what other thing should the
sta^dredberer of relygio^ and virtue falling in decay / do in this matter / as
well as in many other? For about that time the church of Rome began to
thretten / and give lykelyhod of great ruin of the faith afterward to follow.

But among the Greeks / Leo the emperor / the.iii. Leo Emperor of the Greeks.
of that name / a man both well learned / and also virtuous and godly (he
raygned in the year of our lord.vii. C.lxxxiiii) distroied al images
universally / and commanded Gregori the.iii of that name by his letters / that
he should do the same thing likewise at Rome. Gregory the third
But this Gregory not only refused to be obedyent to the emperors
commandment / but also at Rauenna was the author and begynner of sedition /
to which city he called a certain menye of bysshoppes and made a counsel / in
which he decreed against themperours commandment / that images ought to be
had in much more honor / than ever they were before.

And to the entente that he might the moore boldly instytute this thing
against the emperor without any punysshmente: not very long before / he had
gone about traytorously to forsake the emperor / and to fall unto the part of
the french king. After the death of Leo / Constantyne his son / the fyfth of
that name / wyllyng to confyrme his fathers commandment and decre / called
together all the learned men and bysshoppes / out of all Greece land / being in
no^bre. Constantin the. v
CCC.xxx. which comparyng the scryptures to the reasons of the counsel / which
we spoke of before / called by Gregory: determined with one consent That it is
not lauful to the^ which by christ do believe in god / to have any images /
either of the creator / or the creatures to honor them: but rather of the
ieoperdyes of offensyons / that they were all to be taken away at ones. So to
the beginning of Leo / Constantyne his son / and all his successoures did
cleue and abide by it: until such time / that the cruel woman Hirene Hiren.
went about that horrible and exceeding wicked tragedye / whereof we shall
speak / not long hereafter. But the decrees of that wicked woman / were
virtuously abrogated by Co^stantynes son / the syxte of that name. There
comes now happily to my mind / the decre of Theodosius and Valens which
Petrus Crinitus / a man that had red many things / does recyte in the.ix. book
/ De honesta disciplina. His own very words I shall faithfully and truly
rehearse.

Valens and Theodosius the noble emperors wrote to ye officer called Prefectus
pretorius: The decree of Theodosius and Valens.
Forasmoch as our dilygent study and care is / in all things to maynteyne and
uphold the faith and honor of god: we forbid any manner man to grave or make
the image of christ our savior of stone / of wood / or of any other stuff /
orels to paynte the same with colors. yea / and whersoeuer any such image be
found / we command that it be taken away / and they sore punysshed / who so
ever shall attempt any thing contrary to our decrees and commandment / in
which thing if any man do require an authoure: let him read the decrees and
commandementes of Emperoures / which have been collected and gathered by a
satyr of the right conning men Trybunianus / Basylydes / Theophilus /
Dioscorus / and other at the commandment of the most noble Emperor
Iustiniane.

Thus far says Crinitus:

It is therefore euydente and manifest / that themperours also which were
before the time of Leo / did dilygentlye provide / that the superstityon of
Images should natte by any manner means pollute and defyle the churches of
Christen men. Pontius paulinus Bishop of Nola the first causer that images were
painted.
The first of all other (as far as we can gather of histories) which did cause
images to be painted in churches: was Pontius Paulinus bishop of Nola /
about the year of our lord ecccl. For he solemnysing yearly the birth day of
Saint Felix / was wont to make a great and a costly fest unto the church /
and to thentent that they which sat at the said fest / should be the sooner
and more easily provoked to temperaunce / and to the consyderatyon of godly
things: he painted on the church walls / images of the histores of the old
testament / yt they should have somewhat also where with they might feed / and
delight their eyes frutefully. Before this Paulinus / you shall not lightly find
/ that any such thing was attempted by any man / at the lest wise / being of
any famous memory. For in such wise by little and little / this superstityo^
must needs crepe in: likewise as other things did / which have corrupted the
puryte and prefection of the church. Now who is he / that does not perceive
and se / that Paulynus did two manner ways offend. for first against the
commandment of saint Paul / he was bold / and took upon him self to make
open festes in the church. And (which again was as great an offense / and
such as can not be excused) he began with images to exhort men unto the love
and exercisynge of temperaunce: when he being a christen man / ought rather to
have gone about to do the same with wholesome doctrine and good example. Wherefore
it does evidently appear that this bishop did in no wise begin that thing
of a pure godly spirit: but if a man do well consydre and way every thing /
he shall find / that with the same spyrite / that is to wit most retchelesse
/ and dispisyng of godly things / other men also have taken upon them to
defend images. For the popes and bisshops (I wot not whether through evil will
or else through a certain pride) began with toth and nail to defend the use /
or rather the abuse of images against the greek emperors: until such time as
by the labor and help of Hyrenes Herene empress
(which after the decesse of Leo her husband had ye rule and gouerna^ce of
the^pyre many years) a counsel was assembled at Nice / in which counsel she
caused to be abrogated and dysanulled / whatsoever was before decreed by
Consta^tyne / concerning the putting away of images. Neither could this
wickedness suffyse and content her mind: but she did cause the body of
Constantyne to be dug up again out of the ground to be burnt to ashes /
and last of all to be thrown into the sea.

This very same Hyrene / after that she was by her son deposed from her
tyra^nous empire / left nothi^ge vnassaid nor never rested until by
abominable and traytorous crafts / she wan again the^pire unto her self:
which thing when she had brought to pass / accordi^ge to her own mind / she
did cast her son in to prison / plucked out his eyes / and in conclusion
slew hi^ also. But when she feared that her tira^ny should not co^tynue nor
last long she made labors (ye pope of Ro^e being broker and spokesman) to be
married unto Charles the great / otherwise called Charlemayn / ki^ge of France:
and for this cause she gave license to the bishop of Rome to translate the
crown of the^pire of Rome unto Charles / hopyng verily that her own tira^ny
should be safe / if by tra^slatyng the^pire of the Greeks traytourously unto ye
fre^chemen / she did bind / not only Charles / but also the bisshoppe of Rome
/ and make them her friends with this great benefyte.

But when Nicephorus, Nicephorus.
which than was captain of the army of the Greeks perceived these traitorouse
disceytes / forthwt in all have he did cast Hirene i^to prison / as she had
deserved / in which she made a wretched end / and changed this life with death
/ worthy and mete for such goodly acts as she had done. O cruel woman,
This same Hirene which dug up the deed body of her father in law / and
brent it. Which put out her own sons eyes / and slew him in prison: which
betrayed the emperor of the Greeks: and this same bisshoppe / the counselor and
helper of the most wicked and vngratiouse womans purposes and enforceme^tes:
which bishop took away from the right and lawful emperor his empier / and
did put in another into thempier who^ it pleased himself: but yet upon this
condition / that he himself should have Rome / and Italye for his part: This
worshipful couple (Isai) auau^ced images unto this estymation and hononour. For
whatsoever images or pictures are in estimation: they may not without good cause
thank these.ii. for it / as first begynners. Howbeit / the successoures also
of Charles / did afterward their dilyge^t endeavor to maynteyne and uphold
these abominations: lest the foundation and ground work of ydolatrye / which
Charles had laid / should have lacked building to garnisshe it full of all
impyetie and wickedness. Howbeit those men in times past / did never than
pollute and defyle temples and churches with so many images / and showing so
many fest apperance of ydolatry (which thing we may perceive and se even yet
by those which they bylded) as have been set up eueriwher in these last.C.
years / to the occasyon of most vain honor: which honor to thentent to make
it the more accepted with false and lieng wonders he styred up and moved
superstitiouse persons in every place / to begin pylgrymages to such images /
to their great hynderance / both of gods / and of faith and godliness, For (I
pray you) tell me what other thing shall a man find in such manner churches
of the blessed vyrgin: than certain fylthy and smoky images? For god (such is
his excedyng goodness) lest any occasyon of ydolatry should be left unto men:
he would that the body of the blessed virgin should not be known Likewise as he
did by the body of Moses. We will say nothing here of the images of saint Anne
/ of saints / nor of the images of Angels: which men with like superstityon /
have begone to set up wel-nere in every corner / and to worship them. And (which
is as great a folysshnes as may be) when there are so many images ofte^tymes in
one church: to one they do give I wot not what power of workynge miracles / to
the great hynderaunce and contempt of all the resydue. Brefly / so great is the
vanyte of images that though i^ very deed they could put us in remembrance of
god: yet nevertheless for diverse occasyons of offensyons and ydolatrye / it
were expedient and necessari to have the^ taken away in all the have /
according to the example of Esechias the most holy king / which did cast down
and break the brase^ serpent / which was set up by the commandment of god:
when he had parceyued that it was worshypped contrary to the commandment of
god.

These things / which we have hitherto recyted / if he that favors the
glory of Christ / will dilygently way and consider i^ his mind he shall
undoubtedly perceive / that whatsoever images ar honored in churches / or any
manner way may be honored: neither ought / neither may be suffered among
christian me^ / unless we will do against the manifest precepte of god / and
despise and set at naught both the faith and also the examples of ye apostels
martyrs / and also of holy fathers. Finally except we can find in or heart in
the stead of the laws / which have be^ made both by christen emperors / and
also counsels to receive the traditions of the bishop of Rome / and of the
most wicked woman / whose delight and pleasure both of the^ / was in traiso^ /
robbries / and co^tynuall study to divide and distroy the

Finally as co^cerni^g (empire, the taking down and putting away of altres /
the which have known the wicked abusyons of the mass / may and will be sone
satisfied and contented without any great busynes / they which do not know / can
not be pacifyed with much busynes: unless they be taught first / how great
abomination ye mass is in the sight of god. Therefore this one thing we
desire to be considered of the^ that fere and dread god / in what manner and
forwhat end and intent / christ our savior did i^stitute his holy souper
Truly to thentent / that this discyples (that is to say / they which will live
accordinglye to his doctrine and commandment) assemblynge together / should
take that mystical breed and mystical drink in comen / and eueryone put
other in remembrance of that incomparable charytie of christ / by which he
suffered does for their salvation: and by the reason thereof / their faith and
trust in god bei^ge increased / should be enflamed both with the hatred of sines
/ and also with love of all virtues / professyng the^ selves to be one body and
one breed in Christ. By this means only / holy me^ ar nourysshed with christ
the meat of life. Now compare unto these things / that which is done commonly
in masses. Masses most specially ar done for the belyes sake: or else at ye
lestwise to purchase some merit before god / which thing eue^ it self alone /
although all this busynes were commanded by god / should yet make it abhomynable
to god. Besides this / there are said and done so many things / which do turn
away our minds from christ which reigns in heaven / unto the work of the
pressed. The congregation hereth no doctrine or exhortatyon in their mother
tongue / that they mit be edifyed thereby. There is no communion had / although
the words which the pressed reherseth do make mentyon of it. And whiles the
priest alone does receive the breed and the cup of the lord: there is natte
/ as Paul says / the souper of the lord represented. There are said also many
things which are plain repugnant to the scripture: for they do teache to trust
unto the merytes and intercessyon of saints. And (which thing is most highly
to be abhorred) where as the oblation of Christ (by which only being made upon
the cross / we are assoiled and sanctified for ever more) ought to be preached:
The pressed bosteth / that as ofte^tymes as he does his mass / so oftentimes he
does offer Christ to his father / and therefore does by it obtain the puttyng
away of all euyls / and a hepe of al good things to the^ only / which by
gyuyng any thing to the pressed do make the^ selves partakers of ye mass / by
the / reason whereof it is come to pass / that so many me^ / al care of
innoce^cye laid aparte / do hope that heaven shall be opened unto the^ / even by
masses alone. Whosoever acknowlegeth the lord Jesus as our only savior and
sanctyfyer / if he do consider these things dilygently / and with the same do
compare those things / which our lord both said and did: and besides that /
did betake to us for to be reiterated / and oftentimes put in use: he shall
esely perceive and se / that there was never any superstityon in times past /
which had in it self so great impyetie and wickedness / so great co^tempte of
god / so great distructio^ of all virtues / as has the mass / so as it has been used to be had now these certain years. And hereof wha^ he knows / that
nothing is so much to be hated and abhorred of christian me^: he shall perceive
that all remembrance of it is utterly to be taken away: and therefore yt ye
alters / which were ye forgers of such ydolatry / and in deed ye rich wives of
prestes but very hurtful to all christian people were in no wise to be suffered of
that governor and ruler / which princypally ente^ded to execute his office to
the honor and pleasure of christ. Let christian me^ know the truth of ye matter /
and than afterward let them

Last of all / this thing also (judge. is to be observed in this matter / though
never so great offensyons and occasyons of euyls come through pyctures and
images / that yet for all that / it is not laufull for any man but the head
offycer and ruler to cast the^ out / namely out of open and come^ places. For
in asmoche as they are outward things / no man ought to take upon hi^ more
power over the^ than the condition and state of every man shall require / that
it is to wit / that every man privately banysh the^ out of his own mind /
reiecti^g ye folyshe estimation of the^. Now to an householder it belongs /
according to the example of James the patriarch James the Patriarche.
/ to cleanse and rid his house of the^. But to cast the^ out of churches and
comen places / is the duty of the hedofficer and governor / which duty (thank
be to Christ) our governor has known / and has executed with christian
grauyte. And one thing is to be eschewed in this busynes / likewise as in all
other / which it belongs to christian men's charge for to do (and it is the
counsel of. S. Paul) that we do not betraye and set forth our good to the
evil words of men: and that the thing which was instytuted to the health and
salvation of many men / be not an occasyon of hurt to any man. Wherefore if any
man in distroye^g of images / should do any thing presumputously /
outragyously / and past the mesure of charity / he should bind himself by so
much to ye more greuouse sine / by how much the thing is more holy / in
which he follows his own sensual lust / and the offycer ought (not without
good cause) to punysshe him for breki^ge of love and charity. Also it ought not
to be ascribed to any outragiousnesse / though vnsensyble images be not so
softely and so tenderly handled / as certain me^ (through a folish ymaginatio^
/ as though with the figure and symilytude of man / they had also man's wits
and reason) are wont to have compassyon / and to sorrow somewhat when they are
broken. For if we were dysposed to take away images / after such manner and
facyon as scripture techeth and commands / which facyon doutlesse must
needs be best: we ought to break them / yea / and that all to powder / that
they might never be made whole again / nor be restored into so wicked an use
in which we ought not to have so greatly regarded the labor and craft of man /
sith it is our duty to offer even our own selves also to the cross / and to
all manner afflyction / rather than to be willing to give occasyon of falling
to any man that walks in the way of virtue and godliness. And would god
there were in all men as much care and dilygence to make much of / and to
beware of offendynge or hurtynge the very live images / which god him self
has made to his own likeness: as we do see to be in very many men / that
those deed and dombe images should not be hardlye / nor irreverently entreated.
To conlude shortly to pluck down images and pictures / and to ryd them quyte
out of churches / is an holy thing / and ought to be begone according to the
commandment of god, It is conuenyente therefore and mete / that it be
performed and fulfilled in such wise / that it may be accepted and allowed of
all mighty god. That is to wit / that they be so taken away / that there be
no whytte of them remaining / namely to like use / and also that yet
nevertheless / nothing be done presumptuousely / nor outragyousely / nothing
that may give any man good cause to be troubled: but that all things be done
charitably / of pure and perfyte love / and desire to do profit to all men.
And after this facyon god grant that his people may be delivered from ydoles
and images / throughout the whole world / from the tone end to the the other.

AMEN.
