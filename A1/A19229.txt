The Anatomy of the inward Parts of man, lively set forth and: diligently
declaryng the principal veins with the use of letting bludde, very necessary
for Phisytians and Surgians and all other that desire to know them selves.
THE SIGNIFICATION OF SVCHE letters, as are placed in this figure.
A SIGNIFIES the gulle of the throat, called also the throat bolle, and in
Late^ Gurgulio and Canna pulmonis. that is to saic, the Lungepvpe and weson,
pertaining to the^ lights and to the heart: conueyng air to then both, and it
divides it self into many holow pypes within the Lunges, as ye se. B
Signifies the Lunges or lthtes, called in Late^ Pulono, and it is called the
bellows of the body, for it draws and sends fourth again the air, with
the which the heart and other members are tempered: wherefore the Lunges be full
of holenesse, even like a sponge and empty, openinge it self to the
receauinge of air, and gathering it self to gether, to expel it again, as
dothe-apayre of bellows: fasheoned much after the shape of an Ox house. C
Signifies the hafte called in Laten Cor, the seat of life, the ruler and
director of spirit and bludde. It apereth within against the left breast: it
is figured round tending to sharpness at one of his ends, the which is to
wards the breast: it is of all other members the principal, and is called the
son of the less worlds: for man among Philosophers is called the less
world, and the heart being in it, is to all the body as the sun is to all
this great universal world: which approchinge near unto us, al things
rejoice, herbs bring fourth flowers, trees spredde their branches, all foul,
fyshe, and beasts, receive great comfort: even so the heart in man being heavy
and pensive, all the body is sad and ill disposed: The heart again being glad
and merry, all the body is light and lusty: For it illumineth and lighteneth all
other members with his spirit. It is the first membre in man that receaueth
life, and the last that dies. Only this part in man is never greaued notably
with any discease, but if it be, forthwith it dies, and all the man with him.
D Signifies the Middrefe, called Diaphragma, Septum transuersum, and
Praecordia, and it is a thyn skin, whicke deuideth the uppar part of the body
from the nether part, that is to say, the heart and lu^^es, from the spleen and
liver. etc. E Signifies the throat pype, called in Laten Gula, and interior
Collifistula, that is to wit, the ynner pip^ or co^ducte of the neck, the
which comes from the (...) to t^^ stomach and through it is conveyed the
meat and dri^^ (...) which by the mouth is sent in to the stomach. And
where this pype does appear above the shoulders where also the throat bolle is
seen, there it is called the throat, and the outward pipe of the neck: And
this part of the same pype showinge it self in the boske of the body, is
called the inward part of the neckepype or throat pype. F Signifies the
upper part of the mouth of the stomach, called in Laten Os stomachi. G
Signifies the stomach, called in Laten Stomachus, the receptacle of meat and
drink, a place divised of nature to concocte and digest food as a furnesse,
wherein meat is sode^: and it is offended with many and sundry deseases. H
Signifies the botome of the stomach, the which (meat being in the stomach
undigested,) is very close and the same being ons decocte and digested, it
opens it self again. I Signifies the nether mouth of the stomach, or the
issue of the same, called in Greek Pylorus, and commonely in Laten Protonarius,
the way by the which the meat ons digested, passes down to the guts. K
Signifies the liver called in Laten Hepar, and Iecur, this is the place where
the juice coming of meat digested in the stomach, is transmuted and altered
in to bludde: but that part of this juice, which is not apt to be converted to
bludde, is altered, part to flewine, part to collor, and part to melancholy. L
Signifies the Gaulle called in Laten Fell: this part receaueth the refuce and
dregs of the bludde, and it cleaves cheafely to the lappes of the liver. M
Signifies a certain vain, called in Late^ Vena portae, and Manus iccoris,
that is, the hand of the liver: this vain receaueth the digested juice by
diverse veins out of the stomach and other bowelles, and sends the
melancholy part in to the spleen. N Signifies the spleen, called in Laten
Splen and Lien, which is the receptacle and synke of melancholy. O Signifies
a vain which in Laten is called Vena caua and Venaiecoraria, the holowe vein,
the vain of the liver, for by this vayn the bludde engendered in the liver, is
mynistred to all parts of the body, to norysshe the body therwyth. P
Signifies the kydneys called in Laten Renes, fastened to both sides of the
body near to the loins, but the right kidney stands somewhat higher then the
left by those the watery part of the blude actracte and drawn, descends
through certain other veins, as ye se in to the bladder. Q Signifies the
bladder, in Laten Vesica, receptacle and receauer of vryne. R Signifies the
stones, called in Laten Testiculi and this is the place where seade is
engendered. S Signifies the coddes, called in Laten Scrotum. T Signifies the
privy part of man, caled in Late^ Penis, in whom be two notable ways or
yssues, whereof the one is the vryne, issue, the other is called the sede issue.
V Signifies the small guts, called in Laten Ilia, in those is engendered the
cruel pain, called the knawing, or pain of the belly. X Signifies the grosser
and greater part of the guts, in Laten called Colon, in whom the excrementes
or ordoure long witholden, receaueth a certain form and fasshyon after the
place. This part manny times is sore vexed with the Colike. Y Signifies the
latter end of all the guts, through the which immedyatly the ordure is
expelled, named also the fundame^t. This place many times is offended with a
desease, called the piles or emorrodes, and this place in Laten is named
Longanon.

The Anatomy of the inward Parts of wooman, very necessary to be known to
Physicians and Surgians and all other that desire to know them selves.
FOR so much as the declaration of most of the principal parts is
sufficiently set forth in the Anathomie of man, therefore will I remyt you
thither: There to behold the operation of them, and here we will declare the
situation and manner of such parts as are in wooman differente from the parts
in man. How be it, first ye shall understand the signification of the
letters, which are graven within this figure.

A The gully of the threte. B The Lunges. C The heart. D The middrese. E The
inner part of the throtte pype, passing through the boolke and the lunges
into the stomach, F The mouth of the stomach. G The stomach. H The botome of
the stomach. I The nether mouth of the stomach. K The liver. Next unto this
letter. K. you se this L letter. V. the which would be. L. and it signifies the
gaul M Vena portae, the liver vain. N The spleen. O Signifies the place and
vessel to the which the sloures be deriuied from the liver, nam menses in
primis sensim eru^punt ab ipso iccinore, uelut per quaeda^ interualla, donec
peruentum fit ad illa (super primum ceruicis pudendae exor, tum) acetabula:
quos hec, quasi hianti and aperto ore effundunt. P Signifies the kydneys, in
Laten Renes. Q Te bladder, in Laten Vesica, this bladder, receaueth the waterye
parts and urine, which descends from the raynes, and it lies in the lower
part of the bellye before the woombe or matrice of the woman, whose neck
enters in at, and is fastened to the neck of the woombe through the which
naturally it sends forth the urine. R Signifies the great vain, which is
diriued out of the liver, called in Laten Parigibba and Chilis: cencaua,
uenarum matter, the moother of all veins, and from whom, and through his
branches, other smaller veins, bludde is conveyed into all parts of man's
body. S T. V. X. Signifies the woombe, wherein mankind is conceived,
noorished, and fostred, unto the time it be of a certain might and force, and
then naturallye is sent and brought forth in to the world: and it is called
in Laten Matrix: before it, is the bladder: but it is somewhat higher then the
bladder: the botom of it extends it self unto the Navel. S. Signifies the
botome of the woombe, where is a certain thycke carnosyte, which boweth
downe-warde and causes a distinction to be in the woombe, T wherefore. T.
sygnifieth the right side of the matrice V The left side. Some there be that
write, that there should be many selles or distinctions in the matrice, the
which is not true: for other distinction then the fleshye part, which is
signified by S. does cause, is there none. In the right side, as Philosophers
write, lies always the man child, in the left the wooman child. And to know
whether the co^ception be male or female, they bydde to mark whether it move
more on the right fyde then the left, for then it is a man, If on the left
more, then on the right side, then it is a wooman: and for that cause also is
to be noted the two breasts, the right and the left: if the right be greater
or harder then the left, it is a token of a man, if the left, of a wooman: and
if she have more pain and doloure in the right side, likewise it signifies
the man child, if in the left, a wooman. Whether it be man or woman, according
to the doctors of physycke and philosophers, when the seade is first conceived
in to the matrix, it encloseth it self after such a sort, that the point of
a nedle can not enter in at it, but by violence. And the first.vi. days
that it is conceived, it remains crude and white like milk. Then in the
space of other.ix. days, it waxes read, and is become thycke bludde. Then in
other.xii. days it begins to come to some fashion: then in the.xviii. days
following the face and other principal members begin to grow in to a full
shape and form, in longitude, latitude, and profundite. In the rest of the
time unto the birth it is conforted and prepared to come forth: the which
many times chau^seth in the vii. month, and the child proves and does very
well: but in the.vui. month few or none prove. About the latter end of the ix.
again, if it be borne, it proves very well, that is the most commone
coursse. xl. weakes after the conception. The manner how the child lies in the
moothers woombe, is this: the face lies on both the knees, both the hands
being between the face and the knees: after such manner that the nose
depends between the knees, and either of the eyes on either of the knees: so
lies it round in manner, and the face toward the inward part of the woombe:
and this partly have I showed you of the operation of the matrice.
A perfect and particular description of the secret parts of the body of
wooman, with the signification of the letters contained in the same.
1 The woombe is called in Laten Matrix as it wear Matter (that is) a moother:
for as much as all beasts proccade out of that as borne of a moother. It
hangs between the splen and the bladder: but somewhat higher then the bladder.
The botome and holownesse thereof, is extended unto the nauel: and it is the
place of the first mass of conception called Embrion. 2 The right side or
goulfe of the matrics, wherein male children are begotten. 3 The left goulfe of
the matrice, wherein female children are begotten. 4 The mouth or entrance of
the matrice, which is unclosed in the work of natural generation and
receaueth the seed of man. And after conception, so streyghtly closes it
self, that the point of a needle, can not enter into it. Yet at times
convenient (that is to say, at the avoiding of flowers) it opens it self. 5
From hense proceadeth the seed of wooma^ in conception: and likewise the seed
of man. 6 This is the division of the great veins, proceeding from the liver to
the heart: and again from the heart, passing through the ridge bone of the
back, wheru^to also the kydneys do cleave. From hense coome the veins whereby
the menstrual bludde (for lack of natural heat engendered of crude and
vndigest bludde) is conveyed into the matrice. 7 The neck of the matrice, is
vi. fingers in lenketh having beneath a narowe mouth, whereby the issue of the
bladder sends forth urine. 8 The privy membre of wooman. 9 Two great
artery veins, whereunto the matrice is fastened. And are therefore called the
wings of the matrice.
