The image of Love.

Here follows a goostly pamphlete or matter co^pendyously extract of holy
scripture / and doctors of ye church / called ye image of Love / very
necessary for all virtuous persons to / look upon.





The Image of love
Proemium.
COnsydery^ge in my mind how that diverse persons in the beginning of the
new year give many gifts and tokens / I would feign have co^fyrmyd my self
unto the^ / if my pouerte would have suffered me. My will was good my abylyte was
lytyl or nothy^ge / yet be cause I saw diverse poor folks give small things
of little valor / and received again therefore good things of much valor /
I thought with the poor woman of the gospel to be stowe a myte or twain /
mar. xij.
upon some thing for your pleasure / trusting to be rewardyd again with ye
woman that made a little lofe of a handefull of mele and a little quantyte of
oil and gave it unto the holy prophet Helyas. iij. regu^. xvij.
And this I be leave without doubt / yt he in whose name I do it fore / will not
se it lost / though it were but a cup of cold water. And as to spiritual
persons and my souerayns / math^. x.
me thought it best to give some goodly pyctures and images of our savior Jesus
of our blyssed lady or of some other holy saints. And as I was seeking about
for diverse pyctures / there came to my mind for to get an image of love.

Of natural love. Capitulum primum.
BUt by cause I wist not well where to find it / I went unto dame Nature and
she showed me many goodly images which she said came from her pare^tes and
forefaders / wherefore she loved the^ very much. Nevertheless I lyked them not
because their colors faded / and daily did dekaye. They were also common to
fools to wise men to christian men to hethen men to beestes to fowls and
serpents and little profit come of them. These images be often times payntyd
vndyscretely and dysceyuably / and does much harm in the church of god. j.
And there be many of them. One that is made among kynrede and parents /
which if the holy ghost put not to his hand it is of no valor but sometime
very noysom / for it makes men blind and peruerteth ye right order of Justice
/ and settyth fools before wise men / it takyth away right Judgment contrary
to saint Paulys doctrine and example / for he said. Neminem nouimus scdm
carnem. ij. cor^. v.
I know no man after kynred or carnal affeccio^ / j. reg. ij.
it caused Hely to be reprouyd of god when our lord said unto him / why have
you made more of thy children than of me / wherefore as it follows in ye bible
he dyed an evil death and his children also / it causes yt Jesus can not be
found / example or figure we have in ye gospel of Luke when christ was sought
among his kynsfolkes: Luc. ij.
he could not be found / therefore says saint Barnarde. Lord I can not find
the but in the cross. ij.
An other image of natural love / is made between the soul and the body. To.
viij.
The soul love so the body that it bydeth woo to be departed therfro / but
when it is ordered after ye holy ghost so yt the soul use the body under the
law of god / for to do penance to increase merytys to profytte other to chose
rather to want all erthely pleasure and to dye than to committee any sin /
than is it a pay^ted image / but if we love this life for to Joy here and to
dilyte in this world for to abide long in lusts and pleasures and for ye
mainteyny^ge of the^ care not for ye displeasure of god / than it is a
deuylysshe image portrayed by ye devil / which is very peryllous and much
myschefe come by it / as it appears in the epistle of saint Paul unto
Thimothe as shall be rehearsed after. ij. ti^o. iij.
And as saint Augustyn says by it is bylded ye cite of ye devil. iij.
The third image of natural love is made by twene the five wits and their
obiectes / as between the sight and beautefull things of pleasant colors /
between the herynge of sweet voice or sound of hermony / between ye tastynge
and savor in delyciouse metes and drynkes / by twene smelling and sweet
odoures / between the feeling or touching and all things yt be pleasant to
it. iiij.
And an other image of natural love is made between man and his wife. v.
The fyfth between contrary men. vj.
The syxte between friends and them that be brought up together from their
youth / and all these but if ye holy ghost work in them it is easy to consider
what ill come of the^. The Romans in old time praised much an image that
they had / which (as I read) was portrayed like a young man standing bareheed
and in his foreheed was written. Estas et Hyems. That is winter and somer / he
had on a short thynne cote / in whose hemme they wrote. Mors et Uita. Death and
life / his side was open that his heart might be seen / his arm was bowed
poyntynge with his finger to his heart / where was wryte^ by it. Long et prope.
far and nere / he was peynted like a young man sygnyfyenge yt true love and
frendeshyppe is always fresshe and new never fading ne faylynge / he was
bareheed for to show him self unto all me^ and yt he was not a ferde to show
him self a friend at all times / his rude and thynne vesture showed yt a very
friend will not refuse to suffer hard things and extreme pouerte for love of
his friend / there was written. Uita et mors. for he yt loves truly loves his
friend all his life unto death and after. Estas et hyems. That is true
frendeshyppe endures as well in aduersyte as in prosperity / his heart was open
for he would hyde nothing from his lover / he showed his heart with his
finger showing that his deeds does accord to his heart and his heart to his
words. There was written. Long et prope. For true love in no time can be done
away ne mynysshed by no distance of place. This seems a good image and a
precious / very necessary to this life / whom Plato Arystotle Cato and many
other praise above all things that be in nature. Eccli. vj.
And ye wise man Eccliasticus says there is no comparison to a faithful
friend. I could find no fault therein save it looked always downewarde upon
erthely things / and cruelly upon their enymyes / if it had looked upward
having respect unto god and to heavenly things / I had thought to have bought
it / but saint Paul for ye cause dispysed it saying to them that painted
this image though they knew god they did not honor hy^ / To. j.
love him ne thank him as they ought for to have do / but gave them self to
vanytees and so fell to blyndenes of mind thinking them self wise / and
were but fools and fell to Idolatrye and to many great inconuenyences. Luc. vj.
Our savior also refused this image and such other / both for this cause and
for yt it looks so cruelly upon their enymys saying / if ye love only them yt
loves you for yt cause: what reward look ye for to have / treuly ye shall
have none of me / for ye have received your reward all ready and this caused
me to seek farther.

The image of worldly love. Capi. ij.
THe world than callede me and showed me an image that from far appeared
very goodly / all burned with gold and silver with many other rich things set
out with fresshe and oryent colors / and offered it to me for little valor
which caused me to draw nerer to it. And in ye border thereof were portrayed /
fowls beestes / flies / serpents / worms / and flowers of diverse kinds / so
meruaylouse and so like unto nature as it had be ye self liuy^ge things. The
fowls appeared so rauysshy^ge / ye beestes so cruelly deuoury^ge / ye flies so
defylynge erbes and flowers and taking away their sauoure / the serpents so
styngynge the worms so gnawynge and freatynge that I am sure ye should a fered
to put thereto your hand / and specially one lytyl worm frayed me much /
which I can believe none other but it was a very living thing called the
worm of conscience. And as I stood chepynge of this image with a bible in my
hand / I cast mine eye upon my book in the first epistle of saint John^ where
was wryte^. Nolite diligere mu^du^ neque ea q^ i^ mu^do su^t. j. John. ij.
By not this image the love of this world for if ye do and look much upon it /
it shall bewytche you and make you blind. And if ye set your love upon the
world (says saint John^) ye charity of god our savior crist yt is the very
image of love con not be in you. The prophet Dauyd showed me yt these
rauysshynge fowls / beestes / and serpents were living men / bywytched and
transfourmed by reason of this false image / and showed ye cause why saying.
Homo cu^ in honor esset. etc. Man lord of al creatures having in him self
ye image of god (whereof he ought to draw out the very image of love) to his
high honor / knew not his degree and hye state ye god has made hy^ to / but
set his my^de more upon these vain outward images through ye which he is
compared and tra^sformed unto beestes most unreasonable and is made like unto
the^. O false image I am sure thy colors be full dysceyuable / thus saint
Johan bad me look surely upon it / for ye matter yt it was made of was very
brytell venymous and naught. Therefore I took it in my hand and looked warely
upon it / and so I perceived that saint John^ said treuth where he says. j.
John. ij.
Omne quoth est in mu^do aut est concupiscencia. etc. All yt is in this world
other it is the concupiscence of the flesh or else ye concupiscence of the
world or else proud manner of living. I remembered also that ye most fair
apples be not always best nor longest endurynge. And saint Paul says. j.
cor^. vij.
Preterit figura huius mu^di. The pycture of this world passes fast away In
time of trybulacyon it melteh away / as snow before ye son. Est amicus scdm
te^pus and no^ permanet i^ tpere tribulato^is. Eccli. vj
There is a friend for a time and do not endure in time of tribulacio^ it was
holowe and empty / as it had be blown full of wind / and so light that it
would be moved with every wind / so bretle that it would have broken with the
leest fall / it cleued unto men's hands and defiled them as pytche and sououred
very ill / it has some way so mad a countenance that it will make some
fools to Joy and laughe so much that they laughe them self to death.
Therefore says the wise man. Bisu^ reputaui errore^. Eccli. ij.
etc. I repute this laughter for a great error and dysceyte / saying unto
them ye Joy in the image of this love / why will ye be dysceyued for a thing
of naught. Quasi per risum stultus operatur scelus. prouer. x.
Thruhe thy laughter this folysshe image works much myschefe / for they that
laughe at it may be sure their laughter shall be myxed with much pain and the
last ending of their Joy / prove. xiiij
shall be ouerlayed with sorrow and lamentacyo^. This image takes away the
memory of man and makes him to forgete god and all that longs to him / it is
so confedered with ye devil that it can not do no service unto god / for christ
says. Luc. vj.
Nemo potest doubz dn^is seruire. No man may serve two contrary masters. This
is the image yt couetouse men use as their god putting all their trust and
affeccion in it / and yet it is as traiterous to them as Judas was to christ /
and said to the devil as Judas said to them that took Jesus. mat. xxvj
Que^ cumque osculatus fuero ip^e est tenete cum. etc. who so ever I kiss he
is for the / hold hy^ fast and led him warely that he escape not thy hands /
and at the last for as much pleasure as he has taken of this world so much
sorrow and turmentry shall the devil give him therefore again. Thus
perceiving these and many mo ill propertyes / I said with the prophet Nau^.
nau^. iij.
Omnes qui viderit te resiliet a te. Every wise man that looks upon the / will
be a frayd and lepe swyftly from the / therefore I ^efte of and would none of
this image.

The image of carnal love. Ca. iij.
THan I saw the flesh stand nere by / calling young persons in to her
shop by flaterynge words / saying. Come unto me goodly young gentle me^ /
I have goodly pyctures and images for you / ye shall have one of me for your
love it shall cost you naught. And thus she brought for the a marvelous
pycture me thought passing nature / whose foreheed high set up glystered as
glass / ye yelowe here trussed in sylke with a fine bonet a perle fylette and
a frontlet brawdred with sylke and gold set with stones and a goodly broche of
gold / the eyes rollynge in the heed / ye countenance solen and chau^geable /
the skyn white as lyly / with some lively rodenes / the neck and breasts bare
the apparel all dysguysed of the new facyon with a long train / where
appeared out ye tail of a styngynge serpente / but I meruayled most in ye
countenance and gesture of it / for stondynge in some place it would appear to
a man with a smiling and flaterynge countenance with ye arms ready to
halsynge / in some place it appeared as it had wept and with ye hands as if it
had called one to her / and in an other place it showed a lowryng and a
dysdaynynge countenance pretendynge great dyspleasure. Thus like a fool I
looked so long upon this image / that I was almoost dysceyued but thanked be
our lord I had warning be times. A certain wise man gave me good counsel
and bade me in no wise I should behold it lest I should perysshe and be lost
by the false workynge of it. Eccli. xix
Dropter spem mulieris multi perierunt. Through the beauty of this image many a
thousand have perysshed / and than I considered ye he said treuth in all
degres / remembrynge strong Sampson / holy Dauyd / wise Solomon / and many
other how they were disceyued. p^. c. xviij.
Therefore Dauyd axed help of our lord to torn away his eyes from the
vanytees of this image for they were so allectyfe and pleasant to the outward
sight / that he could not refrain him self therfro. Than Solomon could say
yt outward beauty was a vain and a dysceyuable grace. Therefore says he in
his proverbs behold not this disceyuable image for perauenture thou lokest
not well about / prou. xxxj.
if thou beholdest only the outward countenance thou art dysceyued. Eauus
em^ distilans labia meritricis. prouer, v.
etc. For this harlottes lyppes be as sweet as a honey comb and the throat of
her shyninge more clerer than oil / but ye last end of it is very bitter and
styngeth more venymously than the tail of a serpente / he showed me also that
I perceived not I was so blyndyd with lokynge upon the image only / and a
little from her was there death and hell mouth gapynge to receive her and all
that were with her. prouer. v.
Pedes eiusdescendu^t in mortem et ad inferos gressus eius penetrant. Therefore
he bad me flee far of and come not nere ye gates of that house where this
image is / for though it be offered freely / yet at ye last it put both soul
fame and goods in great Ieoperdy. To. viij.
And saint Paul says if ye live after flesshly pleasure delytynge in this
image ye shall dye ghostly a very ill death therefore says he it is not only
good not for to touch it / but it is necessary to fle far from it and from
all that longs thereto / it has a foul sanoure to them ye has good
tastynge / it gendereth pockes and leprousy both in body and soul / and is so
infectyfe that many be daily in great Ieoperdy to perisshe thereby / if they
have no help and socoure only of god.

The image of artyfycers: be not the very images of love / nor but lytyl
conducynge to pyete and charity. Capi. iiij.
THan leaving these peryllous images I went to ye artyfycers yt make
meruaylous goodly images in diverse matters as i^ metal / stone / tymbre / and
cloth diverse ways / but the very image of love was not there. Nevertheless
there was many goodly images which I though should stere a man to devotion and
to the love of god. And because it was hard to find ye very treu image / I
set my my^de to by one of these and as I was choosing out of ye goodlyest /
there came to me a holy devout doctor rebukynge me gretely / Iero. de fet^
and said why do thou cast away thy monye upon these corruptyble and vain
things / thy goods were not given to the for that entente thou art much to
blame / seyst not thou ye goodly living image of god most pyetefull fade and
decay every day in great multitude / and yet yt will bestow thy money upon
these / if thou having worldly substance seyste thy brother have need / j.
John. iij
and thou sparest from him the treasure of mercy and pyete in thy heart how is
the charity of god in the / why sir said I may not I spe^de mine own good as I
will / so that I spend it not in sin: and poor people were in extreme
necessyte / I should sin deedly if I should se them be lost having more
than is necessary for me / but I know none such and there be many that will
and be more able than I to help the^ / nor I am not bounden to seek where
such be that be in extreme necessyte. nota bn^.
Thus we fell in to a long dysputacio^ and at ye last he concluded thus / yt
not only extreme necessyte does bind us to give alms but also when we have
more superfluus / yt is when we have more than is necessary to our state / and
he ledged for him the gospel of christ. Luc. xj.
Ueru^tamen quod superest date elemosina^. Give alms of that that is
superfluus / it is to be thought that there shall be no little company / of ye
lift hand of christ where he shall give sentence of dampnacyon upon them /
rehersynge the lack of alms doing / as pryncypall cause in manner? where the
sentence is given / he brought in saint Ierom in ye decrees / saint Augustyn
upon ye psalm. disti^. xlij.
Lauda Jerusalem dn^m. Saint Thomas scda scde / and saint Ambrose dysputynge
against such persons that says thus / I break not ne take away none other
men's goods but keep that is mine own / against whom says saint Ambrose O
folysshe man what is thine / disti^. xlvij
what broughtest thou in to this world / is god unjust for that he will give
more to one than to another / or is he vnryghtwyse for because thou do
habounde / and an other man do lack / it is rather for to show the experience
of his gentylnes that thou sholdest have the greter merit for ye well
bestowynge of thy goods unto the poor. And for yt the poor might be as well
rewarded for his patience / and thus he did conclude. It is the bread and
sustenaunce for the hungry that thou reteynest with the / it is the clothing
of naked men u thou sparrest up in thy presses / it is ye redempcyon and relyfe
of them yt be in thraldom and prison / ye money that thou hydest in the ground
(as well it is sin not to give unto the nedy when thou have superfluus) hec
a^bro. disti^. xlvij
as it is to take away wrongfully from them that have any thing / therefore
be ware how thou spendest thy goods / why sir said I may not I spend my
goods none other ways but in alms. Riches says he / is not to be loved for
it self / but for an other thing / that is for ye necessyte of this present
life. That / that is not necessary another to the necessary sustenaunce of the
body / nor to the honest and reasonable mayntaynynge of the degree and state
of a person? can not well be ordered but to an ill end / except it be
bestowed upon poor people / or to the necessytees of crystes church / as to
the maynteynynge and defending of the faith / to ye magnyfyenge of gods
honor and to thencreace of virtue and good life / and this you thynkest does
make thy purpose / but yet it is not so / for as it is said in the law these
images be ye books of lay people simple and unlearned that be imperfect in
ghostly life / and if they excyte peoples minds to devotion as well that may
be by such as be of little price as by the^ as be of great price and curiously
wrought which me thinks bring in to the mind vanyte or euagacyon / rather
than devotion or contemplacyon / and perauenture some effeccyon or spyce of
proprite among relygyouse / therefore se thy conuersacio^ be holy and meke /
and thy doctrine wholesome / and let that be the thing that shall stere people
to devotion. Thus almoost confounded I said to him / be ware sir what ye say:
your opinion condemn the doing of many good men ye be now a days / which
honor the temples of god with many goodly images of great cost of silver and
of gold set with perle and stone great plenty of coopes and vestementes of
tyssewe and cloth of gold and marvelous riches in plate as crosses /
ca^delstyckes / sensers / chalyces with many other things which be gretely to
the honor of god. A. ha says he. nota bu^.
I se it is but vain to preche and teache men to learn and take example of
saint Ambrose / saint Augustyn / Gregory / Exuperij / Nycholas / Martyn holy
bisshoppes / and such other in whose time were but little of such things /
they would have all things yt longed to ye church / and specially to the
sacraments / honest pure and clean / but not costly nor curyouse / than were
treen chalyces and golden priests / now be golden chalyces and treen priests
or rather erthen priests / tha^ were relygyous cladde with here and sack /
and now they do dysdayne or grudge to were wullen / than were monasteryes
hostryes for poor men / and now they be palacyes for lords and states / than
they were apparelled with mekenes pouerte chastity and charity / John. x.
now with sylkes cloth of gold pomp and vanyte / yet if there were no poor
people / I might yet some what hold with all / but christ says we shall ever
have poor men among us. And also saint Paul says. Templuz dei sa^ctu^ est
quoth estis vos. The temple of god is a holy thing yt is none other but your
self. The temple of stone is not holy but by reason of the living temple /
therefore that is more holy and needs more to be maynteyned and anourned /
should we than go lay up or spend our riches in the stony temple / and suffer
the quycke of the temple to perysshe other bodily or ghostly. We find not that
christ commanded to have so costly paramentes in his church / but he
commands many times to norysshe his poor people / and now men leave the
commandments of god for their own tradycens and ceremones / as ye scrybes
and pharyseys did / why did christ and other holy fathers of relygyon
prohybyte dyuersyte and curyosyte of pyctures / and assygne how many
vestementes and coopes with other paramentes they should have to ye Aulters.
But some lay against me / Moses that made ye tabernacle of god / with great
sumptuousnes of silver and gold and precious stones / and Salamon likewise the
temple / but yt make not with them / but rather more aynst the^ / for all such
things were but figures and shadows as saint Paul says unto us under
crystes law / j. cor^. x.
that is the very spyrytuall and perfyte law / therefore we should leave the
shadow and follow the treuth avoiding that is Imperfyte / and take that that
is perfyte. Also in the time of moses it was no need to give alms to the
poor peole / for they were fed with manna in deserte / and their clothing
dekayed not of all the times that they were there / as it is red in deutronomy.
deuteronomy. viij.
In the time of Salamon there was so great habu^dance of gold and silver yt
silver was not set by / as we have in ye third book of kings. iij. reg. x.
But why do I labor in vain / what need me to stere all ye world agynst me
(specially priests and relygiouse) it is but extreme madness to labor in
vain and to get nothing but hatred / yet I condemn no man pertycularly /
but if we look well upon holy scripture and upon the old living of good
christian men / if books be true / we may se and know that we be now out of
the way / and full unlike unto the priests and relygyouse in old time / I
pray god yt many be not only unlike / but also contrary to their living. But
thou good brother I pray yt somewhat lene to my counsel / medell with no
tryfles ne vanytees / covet not to please ye world / ne fere not to dysplease
it / if thou will please god. And thou will have this image yt thou sekest /
leueall these other images and go to holy scripture / and there thou shall
find it.

Where the treu image is found and what it is. Capi. v.
THan as I stood coniecturynge what I might do / scripture spoke unto me and
said. luc. xxiiij
O folysshe man why do thou seek a living thing among deed things /
light in derkenes / a ghostly thing among erthely things / incorruptyble
among corruptible / it is not there / it is meruaylous goodly and wonderful
to be hold / the image that thou sekest it can not be seen of ye bodily eyes /
but only with Aungelles eyes and pure with them that be deed from this world
leuynge with christ / and he said also all that ever I had was nothing to the
price thereof. Nevertheless I would feign have had it / sapi. vij.
for though I saw it never I remember that a shadow I saw thereof in a
glass which passed by me suddenly without any taryenge and delited me so that
ever syns I have such a desire to it that I would be glade to give all that I
have for a little sight of it / but considering mine unworthiness and
inhabylyte to come thereby / I stood in a stody whether I might seek any more
for it in scripture or not. Than met with me the prophet and showed that it
was vain for me to give corruptyble images to such persons. p^. xliiij.
Quia omnis gloria eius filie reges abintus. For all the glory and pleasure of
a ky^ges daughter / is inward ghostly in ye soul / ye be ye daughters of the
heavenly king espoused to his sone Jesus / your father I suppose did give you
this lively image wha^ he spoke to you by grace and said. Audi filia et vide.
etc. Here my daughter and se Inclyne thyn eere and be obedyente / forgete thy
contrary men / forgete thy fathers howsholde / that is forsake thy natural
love / thy worldely love / thy flesshely love / forsake all vanytees and make
the naked of all erthly things / by pouerte and chastyte / and than the king
my sone shall couete the beauty and apparel the with clothes of verteu. j.
pet. ij.
Thus I doubt not he yt has called you from derkenes / unto so great light of
grace / and has now taken you unto his spouses he has now showed you this
image and given it unto you much more goodly than I can dyscryue it as it is /
for it is infinyte and incomprehensible / yet it pleases hy^ to show it unto
all meke souls after their capacite calling them his daughters saying. Audi
filia. Here my daughter in treu faith and meke obedyence. Et vide. And se what
I have do and do daily for you / se what ye do again or have do for me / se
also what I do prepare for you. The beholding of these three things I thy^shold
leave some prynte of this image in our souls but much more in you yt be his
special spouses. And of this prynted image at ye leest I would show you
somewhat in part to perform mine intent and yet I fere me of presumpcion in
enterprisynge for to show that I never knew / or that ye know better than I
/ yet a blind man may show yt he can not se if it be put in to his hands.
Saint Paul put a glass in to my hand / holy scripture and bade me come out
of derkenes in to light / for if thou will se this image you must look besely
upon this glass / for it can be showed none other wise here but by a glass in
a derke symylytude which do not show the thing expressly as it is / j. cor^.
xiij.
but the time shall come I trust that we shall se the very self thing in deed.
I looked upon this glass and I could se nothing but my own face foully
deformed with many foul spots / I was bydden for to go wasshe me and make me
clean and get me unto the light so I did / and yet my eyes were so dymme with
duste / and humor of vanyte and carnalite / that I could not yet perceive this
image. I went to a place of relygyon and took a ghostly father / showing him
mine entente that I came fore to clarifye my sight that I might at the leest
ones se this image. There me thought it should be / for there were ye most
goodly aparyld aulters with tabernacles subtelly caruen and costly gylte /
there was ye most swetest armony of songs and organs and goodly devout
obseruau^ce yt ever I saw or herd / in so much that it moved me for a time
unto relygyon there / wherein I asked counsel of my ghostly fader / but he
persuaded me the contrary / saye^ge it is not all gold that sheneth as gold /
there is one thing yt dystroyeth much goodness the in ordynate love to our
self / which is cause of much ill as saint Paul the holy man prophesyed to
his dyscyple Thymothy / ij. ti^o. iij.
saying that at the last end of the world / there shall come paryllous
seasons men shall have inordynate love unto them self that shall cause them to
be couetouse / hy my^ded / dysoaynouse / proud / blasphemouse / dysobedyent to
their parents / cruel and unkind without inward love or affeccion / without
peace / false accusers / unchaste / vncurtese / without gentylnes / trecherouse
froward and sturdy / lovers rather of voluptuousnes than of god / having a
cloked image a symylytude of pity that is of honor and love to god / but the
very virtue and effect thereof / they renounce and have it not / be ware of
such says saint Paul and exchewe the company. Thus I perceived that charity
might lack / nota bn^.
for all this gay outward things and obseruau^ces for all the gaye singing
and playenge or multyplyenge of orysons nor yet they be not evident profes of
love and charity / but some time some of them lets or hyndereth charity and
contemplacyon sterynge the mind to elacion and vaynglory / but charity says
saint Paul / j. cor^. xij.
is to edyfy our neighbor to think our self members of one body and so to
use our self one to an other / as the members naturally do in the body and so
to use our self one to another considering our self as one body in christ to
be as glad of our neighbors profit as of our own / to help them in their
distress as they would be helped in their own / louyngely to reform and
correct them that do a miss to help and releue them that be fallen in decay
bodily or ghostly / to conforte the heavy / to help the seek / to socoure the

And as to say in few words to refer all our riches labor studyes and
care to this end / that we might profit and do good unto many in our savior
christ that as he was not borne for his own profit nor lived here for his
own pleasure / nor dyed for his own greter pleasure / ne for to come the
rather to Joy / but he gave him self all hole to our use and profit / so
should we apply our self to the co^modytees and profytes of our even christian
and not to our synguler profit only / the more we profit unto many / the
more is our avail and merit / if it were thus said a good relygeouse man to
me the life of relygeous should be much more Joyous pleasant and easy than it
is / where now we se it is contrary / heavy paynfull laborous full of
supersticyons obseruau^ces and vain customs leaving fro them ye treu way of
life ye following of christ the old manner of living yt was used taught and
showed by our holy fore fathers. Saint Augustyn saint Benet saint Jerome / with
many other / so yt now there is little deffere^ce between lay persons priests
and relygeouse in crimes and worldely living / to whom it is said. To. xij.
Nolite conformari huic sclo. Be not confyrmable to this world / and though
their outward habyte dyffer in coler it is like or exceeding in price so yt if
saint Augustyn or saint Benet were again a live (whom they take as fathers
and auctours of their rules and orders of their living) I think they should
not know the^ / but say there was never thing yt they more dysaproued / than
such living as is now in many places / they will say that they ordained the
manner of living after the rule of criste and his appostles / not after the
superstycyouse manners of the Jews yt made gaye and fair al thing without
forth / and were wtin forth full of raven venyme sin and malice. The image of
love yt saint Paul drew / which these holy fathers had set forth openly in
there monasteryes / warning their discyples and successors before all things
to look thereupon under great co^munycacions and pain of cursynge / is now new
portrayed with dyspensacyons dysceyued with vain customs dysceyuable colors
clean altered from the old symylytude and naught but as a feigned thing / and
they that do thus says saint Paul do not agree to ye holy doctrine of christ /
ij. ti^o. vj.
but are proud / and can nothing but multyplyenge of words whereof come
contencyon blasphemy and many ylles / thinking great honor to god and a deed
of pity to gather riches and to encreace temporal patrimony / but ye very
riches is to use deeds of charity being content with mete / drink / and
clothe.

The propertees and effects of this image. Capi. vj.
THis image as saint Paul discryueth it / is very pacyent meke and gentle of
countenance / j. cot^. xiij.
charitable without envy to any person / it does no wrong it is not inflate
ne blowyn full of pride / it pretend none ambycyon / ne look another for honor
ne dygnyte / it requires no profit for it self but only to profit other /
it has none angry countenance so that ye shall think it can ymagen none ill
/ it bears an heavy chere unto all that is ill and false / and a Ioyouse unto
treuth and goodness / it is very strong for it may bear all trobles and
aduersyte / it believes all treuth though it be a boue reason / it has good
hope in all thing yt god promises / it is steadfast and perceuerant bery^ge
pacyently all manner of displeasures without grudgynge till better may be / it
never fails ne fade / but the more longer that it endures the more oryent
and goodly is ye colors and ye more strength and virtue it is of and the more
pleasant it is to behold / it is so goodly that no creature can praise it at
the full nor have the full knowledge of it in this life to dyscryue it as it is /
Grego.
it works marvelous things and great / wyghty / and substancyall in effect
if it be ye very image / if it be not the treu image it has but small effect
or none / it has this marvelous effect yt what so ever is wrought or done
where that is present it is suffycyent and good though some time it appears
ill to some persons / j. cor^. xiij.
and contrary wise all thing that is done where that is not present though it
seems never so good yet it is but of little valor or naught / it uneath and
make many men all one and co^feder them so fast together that nothing can
sundre them / Colo. iij.
it covers the syn^e of penytentes and redemeth their forfertes and
transgressyons / j. pet. iiij.
who so ever have this image upon him shall not need to fere any parell nor no
Judgment may go against hy^ ne nothing can hurt him / j. John. iiij
it gives light in darkness it causes Joy in heaviness mirth in sadness / in
pain it makes glad pacyence / there can no wrong be done where it is / it
makes peace and concord / it sets all thing in order it swageth hungre
and thurst it makes bond men free poor men rich seek me^ hole / ye and some
times it reseth the ded to life / Osee. xj.
it is so attractyfe that it draws all good things to it self and than
makes all common / some time it has a sharp and a rygorous countenance upon
sinners but never malycyous nor enuyous countenance / it morneth with morners
it Ioyeth with them yt be glad / it wepeth with wepers it takes away all
suspycyous and mysiugynge from the heart of man / it abhors all strife envy
murmr and contencyon / it hates all ill and loves all yt is good / there is
nothing that pleases god more than this image and without it nothing can
please him / there is nothing more desirous to the devil than the dystruccyon
of it and to that intent he applies all his labor all his cast with most
extreme malice in forsynge both night and day full besely to dystroye this
image of love / yt is none other but charity. But now lokynge in ye glass of
holy scrpture for this blyssed image / and perceiving my blyndenes / my
ygnoraunce / my unkindness / my unworthiness / wretchedness / and presumpcyon / I
fere me rather to get shame and reprefe than thanks for mine enterpryce
seeing this image so excellent so beautefull so full of virtue and grace so
far exceeding the praysynges and commendacyon of all men. And yet I wretch
most simple without learning presume to show in any manner thy heavenly image:
yt am most vnkonnynge to give the leest praise unto it yt can be. Nevertheless
as I said before a blind man hold the image. D.j. forth a picture for other
to behold / if it be put in to his hand though he handle it grossly and show
it forth rudely / so it is and yet me think I presume blind and ygnoraunt / I
take of other holy doctoures this image to show unto you which I think
verily ye can show more hansomly unto me and better dyscerne it than I yet
though I can show no pleasure by reason of mine vnko^nynge and rude handlynge
of this image / I trust at the leest ye shall be content for to se the simple
image of mine own love toward you. And though it be rude and of lytyl
valor to consider my spyrytual intent and good will ye would better if it
could.

That this image is a living thing taking a patron of ye inuysyble image of
god. ca. vij.
I said be fore yt this image is a living thing and can not be found among
these deed images there is one yt saint Paul speaks of. Colo. iij.
Qui est imago dei inuisibilis. An image of god Invisible incomprehensible the
sone of god by whom he has made all creatures and man most syngularly unto
his image and symylytude / and because he was inuysyble and incomprehensyble /
he took a glass that is our nature / which well may be compared to a brytyl
glass wherein he showed us this image of love that is himself / in whom
though there appeared infynyte power and wisdom / yet charity passed all as
unto our behofe / for that put away the old image of death in our soul / and
renews his image again in us and made it quycke through his image of love /
Colo. iij.
without ye which we are but deed as saint John^ says. j. John. iij.
Qui no^ diligit manet in morte. He yt is not in charity is deed in his soul
thus ye may se in part an image of love / yt is charity which is god himself
and life of our souls whom we can not well se but by ye glass of his humanite.
A glass show not the image so much as it is / no more we can consider his
love so much as it is / a glass can represent nothing: but if somewhat be
present unto it. So in man can be no charity but if god be present unto his
soul / for. Deus charitas est et q^ manet i^ charitate i^ deo manet. j. John.
iiij
etc. God is charity says saint Johan / and he that is in charity is in god /
and god is in him / In whom soever god is he does no syn^e / if he do syn^e /
god is gone from him / if god be gone this image is lost and gone from him /
as in the material glass ye person that was present to it going away / ye
image in the glass seaseth and has no being. And forthwith the devil is
ready to present himself to ye glass / causynge his contageouse image therein
which infecteth so the glass: that it is hard to purge it and to polisshe it
clear / to make it apt and able to receive again ye image of god but if it be
done be times / and many times it is broken or it can be made clean. hebre. iiij
Remember therefore that god is always present in every place and never
withdraw his love from man / but many ways provoke them (ye his enymyes)
unto love / math^. v.
and makes his sone of grace and right wysnes to shine upon every person good
and ill. The grace of christ and his doctrine is the light / keep the glass
toward the light / torn it not a way toward darkness / and this image
shall ever contynewe in the glass. Saint Johan says / John. ij.
he that loves his neighbor / he dwells in light / and in him is no
sklaunder ne occasyon of ill / he that hates his neighbor is in derkenes /
and torneth his glass from ye light walkyng he wot not where / sometime in ye
mire of other men's sins / by suspectynge Judging or talking of their
defautes / sometime among the serpents of sclaunder / detraccyon / and envy /
sometime among the thorns breres and wild beestes of covetous malice and Ire
/ sometime stummelynge among swyne in the foul sleweth and stynkyng gore of
gloteny and beestly lusts of the body / with many other parillous ways
wandering with great Ieoperdy into death of the soul for lack of light /
which is not in defaute of the light of grace ne for the charity of god is not
present / because the glass is turned fro the light and tha^ it is so infecte
and defiled in derkenes / that it is unapt to receive the light of grace and
the image of charity again as I said before / for it is hard to remove the
foul deedly image of sin / and only possible unto him that is auctour of
life and maker of this glass. If we will turn it again redressynge our love
toward him and toward our neighbors / tha^ shall we receive this image of
life again. And say with saint Johan. Nos scunus qm^ translati sumus de morte
ad vita^: j. John. iij.
qm diligunus ir^es. We know yt we be translated from death to life / if we
love every person as our self / for if we can not love them that we se every
day with our bodily eye / how shall we love god that we can not se. j. John.
iiij
Therefore I may say ye charity is a living image and the spyryte of life that
gives only life unto the body / and as the body has.v. wits and works
all his works by them so ye soul has.v. ghostly wits whereby it works all
thing that is merytoryous and pleasynge unto god.

This living image has.v. wits and the operacyons of them. capi. viij.
OF these.v. wits saint Barnarde speaks in a sarmon showing that there
is.v. manner of loves. The first is a reverent and a kyndly love of parents and
kynsfolkes. The second is the Iocounde and pleasant love of our neighbors
and they that dwell together. The third is ryghtwyse love yt we ought to have
unto every reasonable person. The fourth is vyolent love of our enymyes.
The.v. is holy and devout love of god above all. These.v. loves may well be
compared unto.v. bodily wits. The love of kynred accords well unto ye sens
of touching / for this sens perteyneth most and only unto the flesh and so
that love is showed to none but that be nere together / touching carnal
consanguynyte. And as the sens of touching is in the flesh and in every
part of the body / so this love is in every thing that has life as well ye
Jews and pagans love their kynne as christian men / beestes also and erpe^tes
love their kynne and ofsprynge. The second love of neighbors agrees
properly unto the sens of tastynge because of ye great swetnes and pleasure
that is therein / and because it is most needful unto man's life for I can
not se by reason how a man should live well other bodily or ghostly i^ this world
but if he love those persons yt he lives among and he again be loved of
them. The general love whereby of right we must love every man / may be
lykened unto the smelling in that / that this sens perceyueth things somewhat
farther of / tha^ does the sens of tastyng / and it has in it self not so
great pleasure and delectacyo^ / but yet it is very pleasant and necessary /
so this love extends not only to our neighbors but to them yt be somewhat
farther of / that is to aungelles and all mankind. The heerynge perceyueth
things much farther of than does the other inferyor senses / so a monges men
in this world / there be none farther a sunder than he that loves one that
loves him not again but hatteh him / for in other senses there is all way
some delectacyon and some nerenes in workynge unto ye flesh / but the
heery^ge in manner goes out from the flesh / as for having any delectacyon
in the flesh / and therefore it may well be assembled unto the vyolent love
yt is only caused by the obedience of gods commandment / Luc. vj.
that bid us love our enymyes which obedyence appears euedently / to pertayn
unto the sens of heeryng / where the great occasyon and cause of other loves
that I have spoken of / are taken of the flesh yt is of nature and kind. But
the sight above all other challenge to it self the symylytude of the deuyne and
holy love of god in that / that is most excellent of a synguler nature more
clear and spyrytual than all other senses / and discerns things most far
of / and know the dyfferences of many things / for though ye smelling and
heerynge do perceive things somewhat far of / yet it is more by drawing to
of ye air that comes from ye obiecte / or thing that smells or sounds
well or ill. But the sight do not so but rather it seems to go forth and
proceed to things very far of / so it is in these manner of louinge. In manner
we draw to us our neighbors / whom we love as our life having profit and
pleasure of the^ / we draw to us also our enymyes whom we love for this cause
that they might be as we be / that is to say our friends. But if we love god as
it is worthy we should do / with all our strength / with all our soul and mind
/ we go from our self unto him / we hye us fast and most swiftely (as the
eye to the most delectable obiecte) we cast all our love unto him that is
onspekably most hye goodness above us and all creatures / having no respect
unto our own profit or pleasure no more than the eye can reflecte the sight
to se it self / but to take it for the most hye perfeccyon and pleasure only
to behold and love him in whom we may most perfytely and pleasau^tly
behold our self and all creatures. This is perfyte enough and pleasure
largely suffysynge / what need we to look for other sith there is none but this
witness / christ himself in the gospel of John^. John. xvij
Hec est vita eterna vt cognoscant te solum deum. etc. This is the very cause
and beginning of life everlasting / to know and love the very god only and
him that thou haste sent Jesus christ thy sone / one god with the. And as by the
sight is gotten most konnynge and knowledge / so by this love is gotten most
perfect ko^nynge and sure knowledge of all thing good and necessary to be
known / and as ye se in the bodily senses the sight excels all other / the
heeryng excedeth the other three / and so one is better in dygnyte and more
noble than an other. After ye order and dysposycion of the organs and members
that they be in / so in like manner ye love of god is most hye / most
excellent of all loves / and of most merit. The love of our enymye next unto
that in reward / ye Just love of every person the more it be extended and
showed the more meritoryous it is / the love of our neighbors and company /
kyn and friends / be very necessary / as those senses which if they failed /
the life ghostly should fail / and all the other senses of love should dekaye.
If a man lack tastynge and feeling / how can he here / se / or yet live. j.
John. iiij
If he can not love his kynne / his neygboures or company that he is among.
How can he love god or his enymye or live in the state of grace / it can not
be. Therefore these two loves be very necessary and except they be grounded in
a better respect thau of nature they be but little merytoryous / and yet lack
of them or hatered contrary to them be more dem^^ytoryous than ye contrary of
the two other loves next above / that is the love of strayngers and enymyes.
And because that these two ye love of neyghtboures company and kynrede may
redely and unawarely be disordred (as we se by experyence) it is hard to order
dyscretely the tastynge of mete and drink and appetytes of the flesh.
Therefore it is necessare for to look discretely that they be not inordynate /
carnal ne for profit nor ambycyon / lest they dymynysh or dystroye the other
senses of love causynge much sin and percyalyte. gen^. xij.
Abraham by the commandment of our lord forsook his good / his kyn / and his
country / for that he should not be dysceyued by this love / and so did many
other holy fathers / as we have examples and doctrine of our savior christ (as
ye know in diverse places of scypture) Dauyd also stered by the holy ghost
said. Obliuiscere populum tuu^ et domum patris tui. p^. xliiij.
Forgete thy carnal love thy country folks and thy fathers household / and
the king of all kings shall cast love unto the beauty of thy soul. Therefore
it is necessary to love dyscretely / so that I love every creature in god and
for god after ye goodness of it / not for the profit and pleasure / for so the
catte loves the mouse / and not to love more that thing that is less to be
loved and less that is more to be loved / for charity is not accepcyon of
persons / but it loves in word and deed every person after their virtue and
goodness. j. Ioh. iij.


Of the apparel of this image and where it shall be set Capi. ix.
THus have I showed you yt this is a living image by reason of the ghostly
se^ses that it has for as ye soul if it depart from the body / all the
se^ses fail and dekay / so if charity depart fro the soul / all these senses
of love must needs dekaye and perysshe and than ye soul is deed. This is the
image yt all ghostly persons delight in and have pleasure to behold. This is
ye living image portrayed like a queen and is the very queen of all virtues /
to whom all cryste^ people ought to entende and look upon. This is the queen
that stondeth always on the right hand of god as ye prophet Dauyd says. p^.
lxxxiiij
In vestitu de aurato circu^data varietate. In apparel goodly gylte set about
with dyuersyte of oryent colors and precious stones of virtues and gifts of
grace with borders and hee^mes of gold. In this image should all sweet souls yt
be the spouses of christ have their glory and delight / not in painted clothes
and karued images set about with dyuersete of birds beestes and fowls which is
but a gross or a colored devotion / let them have such yt feel no glory
inward in their souls / ij. cor^. j.
by testymony of good conscience yt have no zele to perfyte mekenes / and
fervent love of god that can not Joy but in erthely and traunsytory things.
But you yt be kings daughters should have pryncypally all your glory from
withinforth. In fimbreis aureis circu^amicta varietatibus. In hemmes and
borders of gold that is contynuall perseueraunce in love and pacyence yt is
treu gold surely proved in ye fire of trouble and aduersyte / apparelled
round about with colors of diverse virtues so co^uenyently set in order that
one sets forth an other meruclouse goodly so yt one increases ye beauty of
an other. And yt which of ye own nature is less oryent and little shynynge
by ye setting forth among other appears much more goodly and precious. nota
bn^.
Put dylygence to obedyence and nothing can be more plesaunt / let mekenes be
Joined to chastyte and nothing is more splendent / Join pacyence with pouerte
and nothing can be more delectable. Conning coupled with lowlynes what is more
shynynge / set mercy and Justice together and nothing can do better /
benygnyte set with magnyfycence sadness or grauyte does merueylously well / and
discrecyon myxed among all these makes all the apparel goodly sure and
profitable. And above all this is ye gylte vesture that I spoke of goodly
wisdom / which is not in getynge riches pleasures and honors / but in
dispysyng them and all other erthly things. It is in compunccyon of heart and
contrycyon for sins in exercise of charytable works / and in medytacyon and
contemplacion of ghostly and heavenly things. In study of holy scripture and
the law of god and worker after the same. The hemme is perseueraunt love as
saint Paul says. j. ti^o. j.
Finis p^cepti charitas est de cord puro and constencia bona and fide non
ficta. The extreme part of ghosty wisdom that is in the commandments of
god is perseueraunt love co mynge from a pure heart and a good conscience with
faith unfeigned wherein is set great plenty of precious stones / ye.xij. artycles
of ye faith / with the.vij. gifts of grace. The white kerchef upon ye heed was
sure hope made by the works of clennes and deeds of pity / whyted with dew of
grace from above. Lo here is the apparel of this image of love. Occupye the
eyes of your my^de in these varyetes / ye be ye very temples of god / set up
therein the altar of your heart and there make your sacryfyce and your prayers
for now is the time yt christ spoke of to the woman of Samary / saying. Ioh.
iiij.
The hour is come when ye very treu worship of god shall worship him inwardely
for spyrytuall things in treuth vnfaynyngely and not in Jerusalem / that is
not only after the outward obseruauntes as the Jews did that kept ye
outward obseruauntes of their law in sacryfyces and in prayers with their
mouth but their heart and love was far from god. mat. xv. esa. xxix.
Therefore he lothyd and dispysed their sacryfyce sayng. Quo mihi multitudine^
victimarum vr^arum plenus su^. etc. What shall I do with your diverse
sacryfyces / I am full of them I require them not of you / but a loving and a
couerte heart he never dyspyseth / and that is the sacryfyce that he requires.

How it should be honored. Capi. x.
OUr lord consider ye inward things of man. Non scdm visionem iudicabit
neque scdm auditum aurium arguet. etc. And he shall Judge / not after the
outward seeing of man's eyes nor after ye heerynge of the eeres / but after the
very right and after ye thought and the intent of man. Therefore if a man take heed and is ware what he do in the sight of man / much more let him be ware
what he do in ye sight of god. The body is cladde in a relygeous vesture it is
well / but what avails that if the mind bear a seculer habyte after ye
world. They keep scylence without forth much more take heed yt ye mind
inward be at rest from vain thoughts not clateringe with worldely
ymagynacions. In the materyall temple we kneel and go low to the ground /
what profit is that if in the inward temple of our soul we sto^de sturdely
right up aeynst god or our superyoures by dysobeynge their commandments /
some fast and abstain from many things that do not defyle man as of them
self / but shall they not rather absteyn them from suspeccyon / detraccyon /
and from all ylle saying of other / which polluteth and defyleth both other
persons conscience and their own / many do adourne and make gaye the
materyall church and has great reverence to it / but what is yt where the
temple of there soul / esech. viij
as Ezechiell said is full of serpents / Idolles and abomynacyons of egepte
that is ill and unclean thoughts worthy to be suspended / we sing and pray god
with our tongue / let us se that we do so also with our heart and mind / we speak
fair and devoutly with our mouth / let us mean as well in our souls / or else
it is not well. The body is kept in wtin a little cell / let not than the
mind be wandering all about the world. It is very well done oftentimes to
accuse our self the image. before a priest of our sy^nes / it is treuth if it
be also before god / when do we utterly accuse our self before god / when we
utterly hate our sy^nes and forsake them with inward contrycyon for the treu
love and feere of god / for an inward wound must have an inward medsyn / if
ye here the word of god which is most necessary for the soul / here it
inwardely lest it be said. math^. xiij
Audientes no^ audiunt. They here and here not / but here so gods words
outward that ye may say with ye prophet I shall here what my lord speaks
in me with fervent desire to accomplysshe in deed that is showed in word / p^.
lxxxiiij
that it may be said to you blyssed be they that here the word of god / Luc.
xj.
that is with the eere of obedience which eere Dauyd exhorted the kings
daughter to enclyne she whose beauty is withinforth in golden hemmes as we
spoke of before. This I have spoken yt we should not leene ne trust to much
unto outward obseruaunces and cerymonyes more otherwise than ye treuth does
assygne saying that also they be lytyl acceptable but if ghostly and inward
workynge goes wtall we may not leave of the honorable and devout customs
and holy ordynaunces of the church. Hec oportet non omittere sz illa necesse
est facere. mat. xxiij
These it behooves not to omyt ne to leave of but to observe them / ye other yt
is the ghostly and inward obseruaunce is necessary and must needs be do if we
will have any profit of the^. Saint John^ therefore says in his gospel. John.
iiij.
Spu^s est deus. God is a spyrytuall thing / therefore says he / he must be
served with spyrytuall sacryfyce / remember he knew not the folysshe vyrgyns
that had lamps of goodly works outward / mat. xv.
but they lacked that they should have had withinforth ye oil of grace /
wherefore they were excluded from the marriage. Therefore rere up an altar in
your temples that is your self that be the living temples of god. There set
up lyghtes get you learning both by doctrine and grace whereby ye may work
teache and show examples of lihtg / make there your oblacyons of a meke and a
contryte heart / there sense our lord with brennynge cooles of love and sweet
ensence of devotion / there kneel mekely with reverent inclinacyons / there
make prostracyons with lowly feere and compuccyons / there fyxe up your images of
love / there use your medytacyons and contemplacions / there behold these two
images that I spoke of before. That one is a great image increate and
incomprehensyble that is god hymsefe. Deus charitas est. j. John. iiij
The other is our little image our little love / created and caused by te image
of god / as a lytyl image in a glass but yet it is very precyouse and good by
means whereof the soul has life and ye ghostly se^ces that I spoke of. And
though it be very little and nothing in comparyson to ye other image that is
infynyte and without comparison exceeding all things create / yet he will have
it unto ye lykenes of his love saying. John. xv.
Hoc mando vobis vt diligatis inuicem sicut dilexi vos. This I command you
that ye love together as I have loved you. And many times he exciteth us to
love one an other and techeth us how / saying love me as I have loved you.

To know when it is ye treu image. Ca. xj.
ALbert says yt a delycate soul and gentyl in manner abhors to love god by
reason of profit or reward / but as god gave hy^ self freely unto man's soul
lokynge for no reward but willing freely to make man parteyner of his bliss /
so a perfyte loving soul should give himself fervently and freely to god in
love wtall his streyngth and power / seeking no profit another traunsitory nor
everlasting / but only set all his affeccyo^ and love upon god for his high
majesty and goodness power wisdom holiness perfeccyo^ and bliss that he is of
by kind / he that loves god only because he is good and profitable unto him
and because of that pryncypally that he should make him perteyner of his Joy
and bliss / he may be conuynced that he has but natural love and imperfect
charity. A very proof of charity christ puts him self in ye gospel of John^
saying. John. xiiij
Qui habet ma^data mea and seruet ea: ille est qi diligit me. He that has
treu knowledge of my commandments and observe and keep them / he it is that
loves me / whereupon says saint Austyn as says ye foresaid doctor / he
loves god that keeps his commandments (not therefore that he is compelled
for feere of great pain or for covetousness of Joy) but because the thing
that is commanded is most good and honest. The love of our neighbor must be
like manner without any regard of profit or reward / if it be treu charity
like unto his that commands us to love our neighbor as he loves us. Ioh.
xv.
There be two euydent signs of love to god in us / one is wha^ we Joy and
gladly praise god in all things that pleases him what so ever they be / when
so ever / of whom so ever / and where so ever they be do. An other sign is
when a man is sorry in god for all things ye be dyspleasau^t unto him what so
ever they be when so ever of whom or where so ever they be done. An other rule
of charity / our sweet savior Jesus putteh in the gospel. mat. xxij.
Diliges dn^m deum tuum ex toto cord tuo / ex tota ai^a tua / and extota mente
tua. etc. Thou shalt love god with all thy reason with all thy will with all thy
mind and memory. ex toto cord.
with all thy reason without any error subduynge ye wit and understanding
unto ye meke service of christ applyenge our study toward hy^ inforcynge with
hole desire to ye knowledge and sight of him. ex tota anima.
with all our will obedyently that is when the feere of no traunsitory ill
dryueth us from his obedience ne love of any thing trau^sytory drawith us
from service. ex tota mente.
with all thy mind and memore forgetynge and setting of our mind from all
thing that dyspleaseth god and lets his love / as be Iniuryes done unto us
/ which when they be called to remembrance be as yren left in a wound
which lets the helynge of the wound. And some men say that we must
forgete our own sins after due confession made / if we will get perfyte
love we must subdewe our reason and understanding under ye obedyence of god
after his will and mind four manner ways. First in all thing that pertayneth
to ye faith / we must obey god and believe him / whereof Hyllarius says. Soli
deo de se crede^du^ est qi se solus nouit. etc. We must believe only god of tho
things that long to him self / for he only knows him self. The second
way is to perceive Judge or consider ill of our self and well of all other. The
third is to prefer the mind and sentence of our superyours before our own
mind / and that most specially is to be done in relygyon. The fourth way is
to consydre our self our acts and all that longs to us / and to torn away
our eyes from the consyderacyon of other folks acts and manners / whereupon
says saint Barnarde keep diligently thy self / and that thou may so do.
nota bn^.
Turn away thine eyes from other men. The rule of charity toward our
neighbor is. mat. xxij. mar. xij.
Diliges proximu^ sicut te ipsum. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self
that is after saint Austyn / thy friend as thy self / thy enymye as thy friend
/ and as every man loves that that is good to himself in body and soul
goods and honor / and exchewe or hate his own hurt and damage in any of
these four. So we ought to love and be glad of all that is good any of these
ways in our neighbor both friend and fo / and to hate and be sorry of their
hurt and damage. Notwithstondynge there is an order in charity whereof the
spouse of christ speaks in canticis. Ordinauit in me charitatem. cant. ij. nota
bn^.
Our lord has set in me charity in an order which saint Austyn declares
this. Primo diligendu^ est quod supra nos est. etc. First we must love god
above all / nex our own souls than our neighbor yt is angel and man /
than our own bodies and ye bodies of our neighbors and as for wordly goods
he speaks not of them / for they should not be loved / but used as a bitter
medycyne. Some men declare that we should love our neighbor as our self. In
deo ad deum. propter deo. In god unto god for god. In god that is for yt he is
a special creature of god. Unto god that is for he is made to his image /
wherefore our entente in loving should have respect unto god. For god yt is
for that he should come to bliss and help us to the same. Therefore to honor
god without end in time of prosperyte we can not well know treu charity / nor
it is not well proved by love of fre^des only. To love other only because
they love us it belongs to nature and it is without reward / but to love them
that love not us / it comes of grace / and to draw our enymyes unto love by
showing pleasures gifts and benefytes / it longs to perfeccyon and has a
hye reward. I thy^ke there is no thing yt makes us so like unto christ
(which is the very image of love) as do / to love our enymyes and to be well
content with them yt say ill of us and put unto us great dyspleasures and
pain. math. v.
For this I am sure we should get more grace and glory of their persecucyon
than of their favor / if we could order us with good manner and use it well
for the love of god. Thus did enymyes and tyrauntes profit much more unto
holy marters toward everlasting Joy and glory than did all their friends.
The very tokens of love to our neighbors be when we are sorry for their hurt
pain and aduersyte as well of our enymyes / as of our friends / and be as
glad with all our heart of their profit health and prosperyte / which be
two denty birds and are hard to find. But contrary the very tokens of hatred
/ malice / and envy / or when it greueth a man to think of his neighbors / or
to speak unto him / when it is paynful for to here good of him / and when he
is glad to let or hinder / that thing that should be to his profit /
pleasure or honest / and dylygent to promote his dysprofyte and dyshoneste /
demynyshynge his good fame / and peruertynge his good works. Crisostome says
that when malice has ones gotten entresse in to man's heart / all thing that
be spoken herd or done / be so taken and understand / that they increase all
way ye more malice and longer enuyte. If there be said any thing of the
enymye that is good / it is not believed or else it shall be perverted. If any
ill be said / that only is believed forthwith confyrmed and multyplyed. Thus
did not christ unto Judas.

The pycture of envy and malice. capi. xij.
I had not thought to have spoken of this deuyllysshe and deedly image of envy
and malice / that is so vggely pale and wan / for it may stand in no wise by
this image of love / except it be trodden under the foot as we se the pyctures
of the devil and of tyrauntes under the fete of saints to their utter
confucyon rebuke and dampnacyon. If I should portraye it like the devil / it
is worse than he / for by it ye devil fell from heaven horrybly dyfformed and
daily his malice does increase thrughe the same. If I should make it like Nero
/ yet is envy much worse / for Nero brent but a part of Rome / but this envy
has set all the world upon a fire yt can not well be quenched. Compare it
unto death / and it is much worse / for it brought death in to the world / and
banysshed man from paradyse. It slew abell and has wrought much of all the
myschefe seth the beginning of ye world / it was ye worker of crystes death
and yet it contyneweth daily in myschefe more and more. It is the cruel be
that was supposed to have devoured Joseph. Ouyde discryued it like to an old
trotte with a lene face pale and wan / the teth black / a fyry tongue / the
mouth full of venyme / the eyes holowe never lokynge right forth / grymme and
cruel of countenance / the breast swollen full of poison / cruel nails with
blody hands and many other ill fetures / but yet he cowde not dyscryue it so
ill as it is in deed. And because to have it in dyspyte / I will cast it under
the fete of mine image as a monstre made of all ill. The tail of the serpente
Detraccyon backebytynge of sclaunder which is a tail of the serpent that the
wise man speaks of. Eccli. x.
Qui mordet in silencio. That styngeth preuely with the pricks of detraccyon
sclaunder and backebytynge / It has the feet and subtelnes of a fox / thrughe
Ipocrysy. A fox in the wodde goes never right forth / but sometime of the one
hand / and sometime of the other / and he will feyne himself deed for to
dysceyue birds. ezech. xiij
Quasi the image. Uulpes in desertis prophet tui. These enuyouse Ipocrytes be
as foxes in wyldernes / they walk by subtel ways that they should not be
espied / and feyne them self holy and religyous to disceyue them that be good
/ it has the belly of a dragon which is Idelnes full of stynkynge thoughts
and false Imagynacio^s / ye breast of alyon proud and disdaynous / ye heed
partly like death and partly like ye devil it has holes instead of the eyes
like unto death / for it has another love another fere of god / it has ye lift
eere like Nero / ready to here all ill / the right eere chopped away like
malcus and stopped that it can here nothing good / the mouth wide open like a
grave open full of karyn / p^s. v.
the tongue sharp as a sword and all fyry / whereof the leest spark is able
to set a hole cite a fire / Iaco. iij.
and all is venyme as a cokatryce. But the prophet will that mine image shall
trede upon this vggely mo^ster saye^ge. Super aspide^ and basiliscu^ ambulabis
and co^culcabis leonem and draconem. p^. lxxxx.
Thou shall go upon this serpent and cokatryce and trede down the dragon and
the lion. We read yt moses. Uerbis suis mo^stra placauit. eccl. xlv.
With his good words pacefyed ye monsters of egypt. But this monster could
never be pacyfyed nor content. exodus vij.
Example of pharo after he was infecte with this monster no manner of thing
another of love nor of feere could pacefy his mind for to be content with the
children of Israel. Be ware of this false monster / and for this intent I
have thus drawn him / that every man should be ware of him and utterly despise
him. j. cor^. xl.
Notwithstanding many times he will trau^sforme himself in to an aungel of
light by flaterynge and dissymulacyon / and thereof specially be ware. But yet
he may be easyly known / if we will not hastly give credence unto him. Thus I
have painted this vggely pycture / for to set out mine image ye more goodly.
Therefore I pray you accept this image of love that I unworthy have drawn to
you vnkonnyngely.

The co^mendacyon of this image after Hugo de sancto Uyctore. Capi. xiij.
Notwithstanding I shall show you somewhat of the price yt the holy man Hugo
de sancto Uyctore says of it. nota bn^.
O charitas qid dicam de te? quo^ laudabote? si sapere^? appreciarer te. etc O
charity what shall I say of the / how shall I praise the / if I felt the or
perceived the I should cast in my mind somewhat: what you art worth / if I
knew thy valor: I could esteem some price for the. But perchance thou
excedest my poor scarsnes / thy price can not be found with me / it passes
my little power / and yet will I give all that I have and all that I can get
for the / all ye substance of my house I will permute for the / all that is in
ye poor loggynge of my body I will give for the / all that is in ye habytacle
of my soul I will bestow for ye / and yet when I shall give all / I may
repute it as nothing. All the delectacyous of my flesh / all the Iocundytes
Joy and pleasure of my heart / I will gladly bestow that I might have ye
only in possessyon. Thou only art to me more dear / thou art only to me
more profitable / thou art only to me more sweet / more Ioconde / more
delectable / than any creature. Satysfyenge me more plenteously / saving me
more surely / conseruynge me more prosperously. I will show to all other men
of the. Say to me. O thou heart of man which will thou chose: to Joy always
with this world / or to be always with god. That thing yt thou love most /
that thing do thou rather chose. Take heed therefore you fay^t heart: that
other thou redressest thy love or else delay not the better eleccion. what manner
of goodlynes is there / where ye maker of ye world is / Love therefore yt
better that thou may chose the better. Chose than charity / for who so has
charity has god / he that has charity when he goes when he rests / what so
ever he does his heart goes not from god. They that have charity in exortynge
of other to charity / they inflame themself with love / and they show not only
inward but also in deed to every man how sweet the love of god is. And how
sower and bitter is the vnpure and dysceyuable love of the world. Charity
scorneth the glory of this world / it dysdayne and reprove ye toylynge and
besynes thereof. And shows what folisshnes it is to have confidence and trust
in these things that passen away so lightly / it merueyleth at the blyndenes
of men yt louen so this erthely things / it wondereth why they do not utterly
contempne them. Charity thinks that thing to be sweet unto all men that
sauoureth well unto her self / yt thing to please them that she loves / it
thinks that thing that she knows to be manifest unto all. And thus it
discovers it self where it is / for it will not abide only withinforth in
ye will / but it must go withoutforth by showing of good works in outward
conversation. O charity I have praised ye as far as I can / and yet I cast
in my mind if there may be said any more excellent praise unto thy laud. I
can not say whether it be more to call the god: or to say that thou dyddest
overcome god that / that is more if any be more / that gladly and boldly would
I say of the / thus prayseth Hugo mine image. Take it therefore and set it fast
upon the altar of your heart / always lokynge upon it / consider the goodness
of it / remember the virtue and power of it / se the many fold merueylouse
effects. It caused god to make man / it drew him from heaven to earth for to
redeem him again from servitude of the devil / it Joined ye most hye and
pure nature to the most low and vile nature wherein it wrought merueylouse
things / in resynge deed men / helynge lypers / and all manner dyseases. And at
the last it wounded christ full bytterly / and slew him full pyteously / for to
quycke^ our souls full mercyfully / and resyd him again full gloryously / us
for to Iustefy / it lift him up again to heaven full Ioyously / there mankind
to gloryfye / it drew up steue^ vyctoryously / and crowned him eternally. It
converted suddenly saint Paul and fixed him so fast unto Jesus / To. viij.
that another trybulacyon ne anguysh persecucyon hunger pouerte to go naked
sword ne other parelles / could not dysseuer him from the love of christ / ye
and it made Paul so strong that he said more of himself and his folowers. I
trust says he that another death ne life / nor none of all the aungelles in
heaven nor in hell / ne nothing good nor ill that is present or for to come /
no strong violence nor hye power ne deep wit / nor any other creature / can
separate us from ye charity of god / that is in our lord Jesus christ / and
after them this love made innumerable people to love and cast away al wordly
things / and to run after christ not sparyng nor ferynge / fire / sword /
pain / ne no manner of torments / but gladly took them with great desire / it
was but a small thing to the^ for to forsake their friends for the love of
Ihesu. And thus not only in strong men / but also in women and children weyke
and frail / and in young tender vyrgyns yt were made by love more strong than
all tyrau^tes that fered another king nor Emperor / and overcame them both in
wisdom and in strength / for to suffer more pains than their tormentoures
could put them to / and utterly confounded them. O good charity O dear charity
/ if I unworthy defiled wretch have presumed to praise the and to show thyn
image thus rudely / where so many holy and noble men have praised and commended
the / but yet nothing as you art worthy / as they wytnes themself. I cry the
mercy and them also besechynge the to come in to my soul for to kyndle it in
love / to lyghten it with grace / to dilate mine heart / to stretche out my
desire / to open ye bosom of my mind / to enlarge and stablysshe thy
dwelling place in my soul. That it may receive ye good lord. Father / sone
/ and holy ghost / most hye charity in to my reason will and memory / for a
contynuall dweller in me. And likewise in you good ladies perpetually. AMEN

Thus Ends this little treatise / called the image of Love.
