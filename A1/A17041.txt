TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, AND MOST NOBLE, THOMAS Lord WINDESOR, of Bradenham,
his Lordships humble servant William Brown wishes all increase of VERTVE and
HONOR.
My Honored LORD:
WITH much industry, and many years experience I have gathered a few
collections, which I humbly beseech your Lordship to accept under your
protection, they are notes that will teach a young Rider, the certain and
infallible way how to ride and manage any Colt, from the first haltering, till
he be a perfect riden horse of the Snaffle: I acknowledge a great unfitness in
my self, to set forth a book in Print, being an old Northern man, wanting
fit language, and method for these times, and in nothing more unexperienced
then in the way of writing: Yet because I know that my own long practice in
this business, has taught me many ways to bring a Colt to this perfection,
which has not yet been divulged abroad, by such as have written in the same
kind: I thought it better to send this poor book forth, clothed with my
own simple language, before death shut up the evening of my days, then to
wrong my self or this art so much, as to conceal any thing that may do
other young men good in it. And because I know that reading without practice
does but a very little help such, who are of the meaner apprehensions.

I have labored with my best endeavor to furnish my Book with pictures of
examples, both of the chief way how to work the horses, and the best
instruments to work withal: I am encouraged to present my Book, and service
to your Lorship, because I perceive that amongst other your recreations, you
are most addicted to have good horses for your pleasure, and excellent
galloping horses for your exercise. Moreover, your Lordship has seen some
proof of my practice, and I am so much bound unto your Lorship, for many your
noble courtesies and favors toward me, that I would willingly pay a better
thankfulness then this to your Honor, if it rested in my abillity: I only
entreat your Lorship to suffer this to rest under your Patronage; and I will
spend the remainder of my poor life, in studdying how to be

Your Lorships humblest to command in all Service, WILLIAM BROWN.

BROWNES FIFTY YEARS Practice.
CHAPTER I. A true and vnfallable way how to Ride and Manage any Colt, from
the haltering of him, from one degree to another; till he be a perfect ridden
Horse of the Snaffle, of what nature or disposition soever he is of.
YOU must have first in a readiness a strong rope about four Fatham in
length, made with a running noose at the one end: Then cause the Colte to be
driven into some large house, where he may have some sufficient room to turn
himself at his pleasure, and to make him the more gentle to deal withal: Let
him have the company of some old Horse haltered, which you must keep ever
betwixt you and him, to shadow you, in such sort as they use to stalk at
foul; until such time as with a long pole for the purpose, then open the
noose wider and lap one side thereof about the pole, then with ease you may put
the same over his head, then presently put a good strong halter, that well be
sure to hold him; and let there be tied to it a chasing rope of four Fatham
long, with a turnell in the one end, tie the harter end to the turnell, then
let there be strength enough to hold him, then put him forth of the house
gently, and bring him into the stable, and there tie him fast to the manger,
then within one hour or two, you may take him forth into some fair place, and
be sure you have strength enough to hold him, that he may know that he is
mastered: then let one having a long repel in his hand, trot him about you
fair and gently, both ways, which being done, let him stand still to take his
wind, and go fair and gently to him, and cherrish him with fair words
during that time, stroaking your pole over him in many places of his body, and
if he refuse at the first, do not leave him till he will suffer you to touch
him therewith. Then lead him into the stable again, and tie him fast as you
did before, then you must get a stick of a yard and a half long, and slit him
in the one end, some quarter of a yard long, then take as much straw as the
slit will hold, and wrap it about fast, and tie it fast with a packe-threed to
keep it in, with the which you must stroke him gently, first upon the neck
and breast, and then to his body, and so to his legs, and so by degrees over
all the parts of him, till he will suffer you gently to touch him in any part
of his body and legs: then you may with the stick in one hand, and a good
long wispe in the other, first touch him with the stick, and then after with
the wispe in the other hand; and so you may make him let you touch him with the
wispe, by often touching him about the head, that he will suffer you to touch
him in any place about his head, both about his cares, and his mouth, that when
you come to bridle him, he will suffer you gently to put the mouthing-brake
into his mouth. Then go and find out some even and firm ground, as near the
stable as you can, then get a pile or stoop stake, and drive it fast into the
ground, and that it may be one yard and a half above the ground: let the
ground where you mean to practice him be even and firm, that he may take
fast foote-hold, then tie your chasing rope to the haiter, I mean to the
turnel, and bring him forth, and make a good large noose in the end of the
chasing rope: then bring him to the stoop, and put the noose over the stoop,
then let some one take the rope in the midst to hold it up from his feet,
and another with a good long pole in his hand to put him about the ring, and
when you begin to put him about, let it be on the left hand, for that will
make Him lead with his right leg, which he must do both in his pace, trot,
and gallop, you must put him at the first very gently about, till he know
something what to do, then you may trot him, but in any case do not change
him on the right hand, till you see that he does set his right leg before, and
when you perceive he does it in his trot, then you may venture to change him:
But where you put him once about on the right hand, put him three times on the
left, for if you do not make him lead with his right leg before at the
beginning, it will be a great hinderance to you, when you come to gallop him.

Now when you have practiced a little, that he does know what he does, then
take him into the Stable again, and if he work to your hand towardly, make
much of him, and give him some reward that he will eat, either hay or Oats,
that he may understand that he does that you would have him. Then lead him
into the stable again, and be exercising him as you did before, till you have
made him so gentle that he will suffer you to touch him in any place, with the
wispe in your hand: That being done, then begin with his feet in this
manner, take any fursingle that is strong; and put the end through the buckle,
to make a little noose to put his near forelegge in, then get up his foot as
gentle as you can, and when you have it up, presently slip the noose over his
foot, and let it rest betwixt his hoof and his fet-locke.

Then with a good strength pull his foot up, and hold it a pretty while, then
let it down again, and make much of him, then take it up again, and ever
give him this word, lift, and so exercise him till he will lift when you bid
him. Then take a good stiff stick in your hand, and ever when you bid him
lift, pull up the sursingle, and strike him beneath the knee with your stick.
And with a little exercise when you knock him on the leg, he will take up
his leg, and then you may bring him to your hand, that when you offer him
your hand, he will presently take up his foot if you bid him lift; and so you
must practice him in all his legs, that when you bring him in from riding,
you may easily pick the gravel out of his feet, and will be the gentlier to
shoe: Now when you have brought all these things to good perfection, then I
would have you to take a good stirrup Leather, and make it full of holes, to
take up and let out at your pleasure, then take up his near fore-foote, and
buckle it up so fast, as he cannot let it down, then take a stick and stir
him up and down, that he may feel that he does lack the use of one of his
legs.



Then have a saddle in a readiness, and let one be at his head, then come and
offer him the saddle gently, and rub it up and down his sides, and let him
see it, then set it on his back, and gird the girthes slack at the first,
least he take a distaste at them; then take away the knee band, and let him
settle himself, and stir him up and down, that he may feel the saddle on
his back: This being done, then make the mouthing brake fit, which must be
done in this manner. The benefit of this fashion brake, is to this effect,
being made all of one piece, the roules being loose about it does make your
Colte work with a merry mouth, and will not gall his lips as the snafflle
will do that is of two pieces.

Loving son, I would have you be very circumspect in this point, for it is
one of the chiefest grounds belonging to a snaffle man, for if you cannot
obtain to that knowledge to make your Colts mouth firm and true in all
points, it will be a great hinderance to your practice, for it is a secret,
that I have been this 50 years plodding about, and now (I thank God) I have
attained to it.

CHAP. 2.
LOving son, I will begin to let you know how many ways I have practiced
this secret of mouthing a Colte. First in my beginning, I was taught to gird a
strong sursingle about his flank behind, then put the bridle raynes into the
sursingle so strait as in your discretion shall fit: then let him strive
mightily, and lie down for anger. This way will bring in his head, but sink
it down clean betwixt his legs, and make him mouth false. To let you
understand what is a true mouth, and what is a false mouth. A true mouth is
this, your Colt must let his upper chap fall even with his nether chap, and let
his tongue rest under his snaffle, and work with his mouth pleasantly, and
yield to your hand willingly, that is a true mouth.

And the false mouth is, that he does wry his upper chap clean awry from his
nether chap, and get his tongue above the snaffle, this is a false mouth, and
what horse soever is thus ^outhed ^ will assure you, he will never bear light
of your hand, but will tire your arms.

Now the second way I did use to gird a sursingle before, and put two wisps
under ^he sursingle, and so rain him up, and turn him loose into ^^me Court,
and so let him strive with himself; that was better then the other: but
neither of them good, for that way did make a false mouth also, and set the
rain too low.

But loving son, I have two ways I would have you practice, if you will
follow my directions: The first is this, to put your mouthing-brake upon your
Colts head, and at the first tie it easily to the rack, so that he may ease to
put down his head, and let him stand so a pretty while, then loose it and put
the reins over his head, and take one of your arms, and lay it over the Colts
neck, and the other hand to be on the near side, then take the one reyne in
the right hand, and the other in your left hand, and let your right hand not
stir a whit, but let the other hand work his mouth, with your left hand with
easy and gentle motions, and by a little and a little, you shall so win his
mouth, that he will yield to your hand willingly, and ever when he does yield
to your hand, then slack your hand, and so he will perceive your intention
presently, and work to your content: You must ever mark as he does yield to
your hands to work his head up still, and in no case let it sincke, and ever
be looking to his mouth, that he mouth true.

I would have you practice this way of mouthing your Colt, for many a fine
mouthed horse I have made in this manner, but I would have you utterly renounce
all manner of ways to set your Colt upon any manner of rest, for I have had to
much trial of that, to my great grief.

CHAP. 3.
BUT loving Son, I will let you see another fashion of mouthing your Colt
that does pass them all, that is in this manner following; First, put your
mouthing Brake on his head, then mark this Picture:

This round piece of wood must be made with a hollow Slit round about it, with
a Carpenter, for the Coard to ride in, and be t^ed to the Juice of the Chamber
above the Stable. And as you set it, so you must settle your Colt in the
Stable, as he stands, you must begin with him very gently, and draw him up
by little and little, and ever as he comes up to your hand, raising his head,
you must presently slack your hand, and give him ease, then draw up your hand
again, and still work him till he be at the highest you would have him,
where you mean to place his rain.

Then let him stay there, and as often as you work him up, ease him, and let
his head down, and so in short time he will clyme so easily to your hand as you
would desire, and carry exceeding light of the hand: and that is a principal to
make his tongue rest under the Snaffle, for that he can in no case get it up
above the Snaffle.

Loving Son, though I set you down a strange kind of mouthing your Colt, if
you think good to put it in practice, and be very circumspect in the
business, you shall truly find it will work to a very good perfection; for I
would be very loath to set you on work to practice, but that I have made full
trial thereof my self. And if I should have a Colt of great worth to ride, I
would begin him in this manner. Now when you have brought him to that
perfection, as you think it fitting. Then I would have you to proceed in your
former practice at the stoop: I would have you make in a readiness against
you back him, a musroule of Leather, made one this fashion. You may make it
either of red Leather or white, and set six very small Leather buttons on the
inside, and a small chain in his mouth, as you see here, that when you come to
ride him, he may bea^e both upon the nose, and the mouth: this being done, I
would have you to take him forth to practice him at the stoop, as you did
before, and at the first I would have you begin fairly with him, then trot
him fairly three or four times about the ring on the left hand, then change
him, and put him on once or twice on the right hand.

Then when he is well settled, and does go gently, then take your knee-band, and
put it on his near fore-legge, and let one lead him fast by the head, and let
another put him forward, and go round about the ring of three legs, that he
may be perfect in going.

The next day when you back him, I would have you keep him forth a good
space, and exercise him well of the left hand, and be sure he le^^e with the
right leg before.

CHAP. 4.
Loving Son, the cause why I would have you to practice your Colt on the
firm hard ground, is, for that I would have you utterly renounce all deep
grounds, for I have had too much trial of it to my great grief, and
^^scredit: the discommodity that does come thereof is this, If you bring your
Colt in any deep ground to chase him about you, if he be a high metled Colt,
and being fat at the heart, and full of his body, questionless he will go very
fiercely about you, and so in a short time, he will be of a great heat before
you have brought him so weary that you may take his back. The inconvenience is
this. First, you put him in great danger of breaking his wind. Secondly, the
danger of the great heat is, he after two or three of these heates, will
presently fall into one disease or other, which will ^ither prove to be
mortal, or to get some tent in his body, that will prove to an extreme cold,
that will prove either to the Glaunders, or else the cough of the Lunges,
which either of them in short time will end their lives. Now to come to the
chasing about the stoop again, when you take him forth the next day, I would
have you make all things fit that you shall occupy about him. First, make a
good strong plat of the longest hair of his Tail, then take a small piece of
Leather or Cord, and tie it fast to the plat, then put it between his hinder
legs, and bring it off the out side of his body; and tie it fast to his main,
and so let it rest both day and night, this will keep him that he cannot stir
his tail: This I would have you do at the beginning, then the next put your
knee-band about his leg, then put the mu^roule on, and the chain in his
mouth: then put on his bridle, then the saddle, then get help enough, one good
strong man to be at his head: when you do take his back, and another to put
him forward, when you are on.

Then tie your chasing rope to the halter, and bring him forth to the place
where you mean to take his back, then put him about the ring fair and easily
at the first, till he be settled, then you may put him on faster upon his swift
trot, and often give him his wind, and go to his head and make much of him.
Then take your knee-band, and put it on, then let one take him by the head and
lead him; and the other put him once round about the ring, then stay him and
cherrish him, then come to him, and offer your foot to the stirrup, and if he
will suffer you to put your foot into the stirrup, the make much of him, and if
he refuse to suffer you, then lead him faster about the ring then you did
before, until he be willing to suffer you to put your foot into the stirrup:
Which if he do, as there is no doubt but he will, then let it rest in a pretty
while; and take it forth again, and make very much of him, then take the
knee-band of his leg, and lead him round about the ring, and cherrish him,
that he may have understanding, that he does please you, then put on his
knee-band again, and lead him about the ring, then put your foot into the
stirrup and rise up and lean over the saddle, and put your arm over where
your leg should be, and lean over a pretty while, and if he suffer you to do
all this cherrish him, then light and take off the knee-band, and lead him
about the ring again, to give him ease, and then put on the knee-band again,
and lead him about the ring, then come to him as you did before, and put your
foot into the stirrup, and bid him at his head hold fast, then raise your
self up, as you did before, and lean over him a pretty while, then venture on
Gods name to put over your leg, and bid him hold very fast at his head: you
must sit very gently and stir not, but sit still a pretty while, then light and
cherish him: then take off the Knee-band, and lead him about the ring loose:
then put on the Kneeband again: then put your foot gently, and get up very
leasurely, and sit a pretty while: then let him that has a rod in his hand put
him on gently, and if he go gently but twenty paces, then light for good and
all, and make very much of him, and take off the Knee-band, and have a few
Oats in a Scuttle, and let him ear of them to give him comfort against the
next time: this being done, lead him home to the stable, and let him rest two
or three hours: but i^ any case give him no maunger meat: but in the rack for
one week or more, but what you give him out of your hand, for that will keep
him in obedience. Then take him out again to the practicing place, and your
company with you: then begin to put him about as you did before at the first
very gently, till he has got the reake of his wind, then you may put him forth
into a swift trot, and then put him into an easy hand gallop, that he may
learn to deal his feet: and ever have a care that he lead with his right leg,
and also have a care often to give him his wind: this being done, then let one
go to his head, and put on his knee band, and lead him about the ring, then
you may come to him as before, and offer to take his back gently, and get up
leasurely, and sit still a pretty while and settle your self, then let him
with the long rod in his hand put him on, and let him go round about the ring,
and if he go gently, then make much of him: then take off the Knee-band, and
let him have his legs, and go once or twice about the ring, and if he do it
gently, then make very much of him, and lead him into the Stable. In any case
give him but a very little at once if he work towardly, for that will
encourage him much. I would not have him in any case to know what did belong to
a plunge, or any kind of Iades trick, but to have a care to have him as
clean ridden as possible may be, and if he chance to take any toy, to reclaim
him before you leave him at that present, otherwise you spoil all, and he
will be worse the next time, where it is easily done at the first. Now when you
have set him up, let him rest as long as he did before, then take him out
again, and put him about the ring, as you did before: then gallop him softly
twice or thrice about the ring, that will make him deal his legs finely: then
let one go to his head, and go you to him: then put on his Kneeband, then
faite and quietly get on: then as soon as you are settled, take off the
knee-band, then put him forward and go gently about the ring, which if he do
quietly, make much of him, and go on still two or three times about the ring,
then let him stand still, and light off him, and do not forget to cherish him:
then let him lead him quietly about the ring loose to give hime ease: then let
him stand, and come to him, and get gently on him again, without the knee-band
on: and if he stand gently, let the man lead him on as before, and so lead him
two or three times about the ring, then if he do that quietly make much of
him, and then slack your hand from his head, and go a yard or more from him,
but not too far for fear he take any toy, that you may be ready to clap to his
head again, for I would not in any case he should have any taste of plunging:
then if he do go on gently once or twice about the ring, you may venture to
go further off him to the midst of the rope.

All this while I would have you let him go of himself, without any meddling
with his head at all, but drawing his head to and fro with the musroule: then
when he will go gently in this manner, you may light from his back, then take
him into the Stable as before. I would have you to exercise him thus three or
four times on a day by a little at once, and that will bring him to obedience
and quietness the soonest of any way that ever I tried, then take him forth
again and bring him to the ring, and then put him about as before, some three
or four times, half trotting half galloping, then come to him and offer to
get on, and if he will stand gently, then go on as before: and if he offer to
stir, then clap the kneeband on, and then he cannot resist, for that is a sure
way at all times to make him gentle to get on; now being mounted, go gently
about, let your footman guide him by the head once about till he be settled,
then he may go from his head to the midst of the rope, and you may put him
foreward your self, and settle him gently, and take both the musroule reins,
and the bridle reins in both your hands, but bear him all of the musroule,
and the help of the chain in his mouth: and bear him very lightly of the
mouth till he be something settled, that he will go foreward gently and
quietly, and ever be working up his head, and never care for his nose bearing
out, but still carry your hand aloft, to get his head so high as you had it when
you did mouth him in the Stable, now when you have wrought him in the ring so
long as you think fitting, then you may light and make much of him: But by the
way be sure ever to give him over in his willingness, and that you leave him
not in any disorder; so shall you find him the next time very willing and
obedient to you: then lead him into the Stable again, and set him up well. If
he be any thing hot, then you may loose the foremost girth, and bring it about
his breast, and fill it round with good dry wispes, then when you take him
forth the next time, you must have some old sober horse in a readiness, that
when you have brought him forth to the ring and settled him well, then let the
old horse be brought forth, then you may let the foot man take his back, and
lead him from the stoops, and tie a rope of two yards long to the halter, then
let the footman of the old horse go before you, and lead your Colt, and let
him follow the old horse. This way will boulden your Colt, and make him go
willingly without any stopping. I would have you go into some large field of
some twenty or thirty acres in compass, and ever as you go be working up his
head, and go round about the field gently, and ever as you go put him
foreward with your stick, and make him go against the other horse: let him of
the other horse have a good long rod in his hand, then when you have gone once
about the field, then you may untie the rope from the halter, and let him have
the rope in his hand, then let your Colt go against the old horse, and go a
pretty way off, then let him go before the old horse, and let the other
follow, and if he stay at any time, the other man may help to put hin on. And
as soon as he does go gently on, then light off him and cherish him, and lead
him home to the Stable, and set him up well. Now when you have him to lead the
other horse, then twice a day is enough to exercise him. When you have brought
him to that perfection as he will go willingly of himself, th^n you may
venture to lead the way before the other horse: but be sure you do not take
your Colt forth at any time, but let one be with you for the space of a week,
till he be well weaned, and will go willingly of himself; and then when you
have brought him to that perfection, you may begin to frame his mouth, and I
would have you very circumspect to attain to that secret, it being one of the
chiefest grounds that belongs to a perfect Snaffle-man.

CHAP. 5.
Loving Son, be careful to understand my rules, and I will (by Gods help)
deliver you truly all my experience that I have attained this 50 years
practice. To come to the matter: first, I would have you walk him fair and
easily, and ever be working up his head gently, carrying your bridle reins, and
the reins of your musroule, two in one hand, and two in the other: for a day
or two carry him most of the nose, the chain in his mouth, let him feel the
sn^sfle with the reins thereof, let him feel both as you find his mouth
frame to your hand: within ten or twelve score stay him, and forget not to
raise your hand, it will make him climb to your hand lightly.

Also I would have you carry in either hand a good smart rod, with the great
end in your hand, and the small end along by his sides as you carry your sword,
that if he bear out his end of either side, you may be ready to set him up
straight, and in any case do not work him too long, but when you do find
that he does work to your content give him over with his willingness, and
clean without any disorder.

Then when you take him forth the next morning, let your man with the old horse
be ready, and if he do offer to stir when you do get up, then put one the
knee-band, and that will make him stand gently, then when you are mounted take
the reins in your hand, and go gently forward and work him as you did
before, and carry him more on the mouth, till you have brought him that he will
obey to your hand gently, and carry light on the hand, and sometimes carry him
on the snaffle reins, and that will make him carry light both of the mouth and
the nose, and when you have brought his head into that place, where you mean
to place his reyne then you may put to your martingale; and I would have you
make your martingale with a buckle, and not with buttons, and broad betwixt the
upper side of the breast and the foremost girth, then draw the martingale not
too strait at the first, till he be a little settled therewith.

Then you may draw it so straight, as his head shall stand even as his head
stood against a Wall. Then proceed forward, and walk him on as you did
before, still observing the rules I did tell you before and ever have a
special care that you do not carry a pressing hand of him, for that will dull
and harden his mouth, and utterly mar all you go about: but be ever working
easily and gently, first with one rain, and then with the other, and you shall
see that within a short time he will work so firmly, and pleasantly, that it
will encourage you to work of his mouth, and ever have a care that he mouth
true. And now that you have set him on the martingale, I would have you to let
your musroule raines alone, and not meddle with them, but carry him all of the
mouth, and work him well of the snaffle reins, for I have tried many a year,
that the false reine makes a false mouthed horse, and now when you have
begun to work him of the mouth altogether, then let your hand work his
mouth, and the martingale and musroule work his nose: so you shall find in a
short time that they will agree both together, and then you shall see his neck
rise and begin to show a comely reyne: For it is one of the chiefest secrets
belonging to a perfect Snaffle man.

Now, having brought your horse, that he will yield lovingly to your hand,
and that your martingale is slack, then you may put him on faster, and begin
to put him on a gentle soft trot, sometimes of a trot, and then of a walk, and
so change from one to another, as you shall feel him work to your hand, still
remembering often to stay him gently of your hand, and be sure you let not his
head sink down, but still keep it up in the place you have it. Then as you
do exercise him, I would have you to draw him first of one hand, and then of
the other, and ever help him with your rod, and so you may exercise him till
he will run perfectly of either hand, then you may bring him about of either
hand, very large in the figure of eight in as large a compass as shall
contain fourscore paces at the least about.

I would have the ring very large, for that you may bring your horse about,
even so that your horse may come about with his head, neck, and body just and
even, for in no case his head may not come one way, and his body another way,
for that is naught. Now when you are working him in both these rings, you may
first pace him, then trot him, first of one hand and then of the other, so long
as you shall find his mettle hold, and that he will go freely and metledly
under you. But be sure you give him over in his willingness, and clean
without any way of disorder.

And loving son, I will tell you one principal rule more (that is at the
first) when you begin with him understand his nature, whether he be of a high
spirit, and full of mettle, or he be dull, and of a dogged condition, for
according to his nature you must work him, for if you work both conditions of
one fashion, you will mar more then you will make, the high metled Colt, must
be wrought gently with easy helps, and little correction, for if you deal
roughly with him, you will drive him out of all; but for the dull metled Colt,
you must needs be sharp with him, and often quicken him up, or else he will do
nothing.

Now to proceed, I would have you exercise your horse in this large figure of
eight, till he will tread it, and trot it willingly, and ever when you mean
to stop him upon the hand, let it be in the midst thereof, between the rings,
and in your exercise you may put him sometimes into his swift trot; and prancke
him up and make him go franckly under you, still having a special care he
carry light of the hand; and when you put him into his swift trot, if at any
time he bear hard of the hand, then stay him and retire him two or three
stepps, and that will make him presently to yield willingly to your hand, and
be sure you fail not, as often as you feel him press hard of your hand, that
you stay him and retire him till he yield to your hand, and within a short
time you shall find him, that as soon as you offer to stay your hand, he will
presently yield and go gently and lightly of your hand, and so I would have
you bring him to that perfectness of your hand, that he will carry his head so
steadfastly, and his reins so round, and stately, that he will not disorded it
at any time; and I would have you have a care of carrying your hand, that is to
carry it a lost above your saddle pomell, and in no case stir it up and down,
but carry it still and firm.

CHAP. 6.
ALSO Loving son, there is another principal rule, that I do mean to set
you down, and I would have you be very careful to get the understanding
thereof; and that is this, to know how and when to help your horse, and how
and when to correct your horse, and how and when to cherrish your horse, which
things must be done all either in due time, or else they will prevail nothing,
for if you help him not in the very instant when he should have it, it is to
no purpose, nor give correction at the unfit time, it preuailes nothing at all,
and if you cherrish when there is no cause, it is to no purpose neither.

Therefore you must work diligently to get the knowledge thereof, for when you
are in practicing your horse, and does perceive that he does stand in need of
help, then let him have it even in due time, and that will prevail; which
help may be given him three ways; with your rod, with your heel, and with
your mouth: with giving a small ierke, with doubling your tongue in the roof
of your mouth, and you may correct him in all these three manner of ways.

That is with your rod in his flank, with the sharp stroke of your spur,
or giving him some fearful word with your mouth: but you can cherrish him but
two ways, that is, with clapping him on the neck with your hand, and giving
him fair words that will please him; and thus in your practice you must
observe all these helps, and do them in due time, for in time being done,
does set all right, and out of time will set all wrong.

Therefore I would have you ever when you are in practicing of your horse, and
working him in his lessons, to remember in time, and out of time, and there
will be do doubt, but all your business will come to good effect, if you do
always remember and carry it in your mind, that in time sets all right and
forward, and out of time does set more wrong in a day, then you shall set right
in a week. But now to come to your practice again, I would have you practice
your horse still in the figure of eight, till you have him so perfect in both
the rings, as is sitting.

Both upon his soft trot, and his swift trot, always carrying light of your
hand, with his head in the right place, and his reyne lofty and staitly, then
you may begin to set him of a proud trot, and to go stately, which in my
opinion is the only show that any snaffle horse can be for upon, both for
the show of the Rider, and the horse for to go of a stately trot a long a
street, and to take up his forefeete comely, and round; and now and then to
beat three or four low curvets, will grace his trot much, so as he be made so
perfect, as he will make his changes willingly and perfectly, without working
on, for it is an unseemly sight for the Rider to work upon his horse in the
streets.

And now loving son, I will here with Gods help, set you down a perfect
and vnfalliable way how to teach him without heating, or chasing him: First I
would have you put on his musroule and martingale, and then his bridle, then
put a sursingle about him, then put your martingale to the sursingle, as you
did when you rode him.

Then take two good strong lines, so long as will reach so far behind the
horse, as you may be in safety from his heels, then make fast first the one
cord to the one side of the snaffle, and the other cord to the other side of
the snaffle, then take the other ends thereof in either of your hands one, and
a rod in your right hand, also then bring your horse into some large court,
that is either walled or paled, and there let one lead him by the head round
about the court, and come you after him in this manner, as this Picture does
show you: Then let him that does lead him go from him, then put him forward
upon a foot pace, and guide him with your long reins, and bring him to and
fro, that he may know your hand, then begin to put him forward with your rod
and make him trot fair and gently at the first.

Then you may carry him something harder of your hand, and put him into an even
trot, and you shall see him presently begin to go proudly before you, then as
soon as you see him settle himself never so little to set his feet to your
liking, then stay him presently, and make much of him, give him some reward,
and give him over for that time, and feed him well with oats, and let him
rest one hour at the least, and then take him out again, and exercise him as
you did before, and you shall see presently, if you sharp him up, and shake
your rod, that he will fall into a proud trot presently, and ever be sure
that as soon as you see him set but five or six strokes true, then presently
stay him, and make much of him: Now you shall see presently at his first
setting, whether he will have a lofty trot, or a low trot, and if he begin
with a lofty trot, as no doubt if he be a metled horse he will, then you need
not use any other helps to him but the reins and rod.

But if he be of a slow mettle, and set his feet thick and short, and low
withal, then you must use these helps as you see here proportioned, and then
you must put them on, and buckle them on every foot under his foot lock, and
you must buckle them strait as you can, that they do not go round about his
legs, then you may bring him to the practicing place again, and you shall see
him take up his feet finely to your liking: and thus you may practice him still
until he be so well acquainted with them, that he will take up his feet so
lofty and comely as shall be to your liking: and when you have him so perfect
going on the one hand, then you may change him on the other hand, and that will
set his body even that way he came. Now, when you have him perfect on either
hand, and does set his trot comely and stately, and that you have his mouth at
command, then you may venture to set a Saddle on him, and the next time you
take him forth, let one that has some understanding take the reins of you,
and the rod in his hand, and let him see how you did carry the reins in your
hand, and if he can make him set as you did, then you may take his back, and
take the bridle reins in your hand, but let him scarcely feel your hand; but
let the other man carry him upon his long reins, as you did before: then if he
do perform his trot as he did before, then you may carry him all of the
reins: and if he do perform his trot of your reins, yet let the other man
follow you still, that if he break with your hand at any time, he may help
you; and so you may exercise him till he be so perfect as you shall think
fitting, and you may cut his trot shorter and shorter, till you have brought
him that he will stand upon his trot, and trot both foreward and backward. You
may not let the footman go from you, but still carry your long reins after
you, till you have him so perfect as you desire.

Then before you leave your footman, I would have you let him stand still, and
bid the foot man shake his rod and set him foreward, then lay your rod on his
left shoulder, and close your legs close to his shoulders, and carry your
hand something hard of his mouth, and say to him, Up, up, and let the footman
helps you with his reins, and it is very like he will raise himself and
advance clear up before, which if he do, then make much of him, and go
foreward still upon a foot pace: but if he will not raise himself with the
helps you give him, then deal not roughly with him, but go on forward a
little, then stay him again, and offer to him as you did before, and if he
refuse the second time, then offer it to him the third time, which if he
refuse, then trouble him no more that way, but walk him once about the Court
and set him up, and get a good stout rod of a yeard in length, or there about,
and get a piece of a nail and knock into the one and thereof, then go to a
Grindle stone, and grind it just of that fashion that the prickle of a goad
is, then take your horse forth again, then let him go once about the Court,
without any man on his back, and trot him proudly, then get on his back, and
let the footman come behind with the long reins, and go once about again,
then let the footman set him up to you, and give him the same helps as before,
and if he refuse to advance and rise before, then let the footman come up to
him and stand by his shoulder, and prick him in the midst of his brisket,
and say, Up, up, and prick him hard and you shall see that he will raise
himself presently without fail, which being done make much of him, and go on
upon a foot pace still about the Court, then when you come to the place where
you did offer him his lesson, let the footman come and prick him as before,
and he will advance presently, and ever when he does prick him on the breast
you must help him with the rod, and close your feet fast to the hindmost part
of his shoulder, and bid him, Up, up, and so practice him till he be perfect,
and ever as you walk him round about, let the footman come and give him the
prickle and he will rise presently; and so so exercise him till he will rise of
himself willingly, which when he will do, with the help of your rod and
foot, then be assured that you have won him, and that with good and discreet
riding, he will proceed and go forward to your liking, and ever have a care
that you do not dull him, but still give him over in his willingness, and a
little at once and often. Now, the next morning take his back at the first,
and put him to his trot, and when he has gone once about the Court, then make
him advance with giving him the helps I told you of before, and then when you
have brought him to that perfectness that he will advance easily, at every
time you offer it him, give him the help of your rod and heel, and when he
is so perfect as you think fitting, then you may teach him to make his
changes, that is, when he is in his proud trot, you may make him to beat three
or four aduances, which will be very graceful in his going, and you may teach
any horse that shall be proud trotting for a Coach for the streets in this
manner: for I assure you, do but work directly after these rules, and you
shall hit all, and miss none.

Now, loving Son, I have another way that I have practiced very often, and that
is this: First, set a saddle on the horse, and put the musroule, and
martingale, and bridle on him, then take two small coards or slips, and put
about either footlocke one, and let them be with nooses to come strait to his
legs and let the slippes be so long, as you may hold in either hand one, and
in either hand a bridle reyne, and also in either hand a switch rod, then get
upon his back, and first draw the one leg up, and hit that leg with the rod,
and then do the like with the other leg and as you take up the one, so let the
other fall, and so continue still, taking up one leg, and letting down
another, till he will take them up one after another very easily and
willingly, and then let him rest for that time, and do not forget to make much
of him, and give him some reward, and let him rest a pretty while, and then go
to him again, for this exercise is so easy, as you may every hour be
working of him, and so you shall in short time bring him that he will take up
his feet to your hands easily and willingly, with a little help of the slips.
But with the help of the rod then, you may take him forth of the Stable to
some wall side or pale, and there put him to take up his feet as he did in the
Stable, and then you may put him forward a little, and still take up his feet,
and so by degrees, and a little at once you may bring him to set his trot
foreward: and if he will not take up his hinder feet answerably, then put him
on a pare of balls on his hinder feet, and they will help him very much to set
his trot true and just: and then exercise him till he will take up his fore
feet with the help of the rod, without any other help: and when you have
brought him that he will set his trot stately and proud, then teach him to
advance as he did before.

And thus, loving Son, did I practice at the beginning, till I came to that
skill, that now I will undertake, with Gods help, to make any horse to set a
proud trot, only with the hand, heel, and mouth, without any engine.

And now, loving Son, that I have brought you thus far upon your walk and
trot, I will begin, with Gods help, to teach you to make your horse to gallop
truly and right, from one degree to another. First, I would have you the next
morning, to bring him to the double ring again, and let it be rather larger
then before, and then put him about it a foot pace, to settle him a little,
then put him forth into a swift trot, ever having a special care that he carry
his reyne as he did before, then having trotted him twice or thrice about the
ring, stay him, and retire him a little, then put him to his swift trot again,
and put him up to his gallop as softly as you can possibly make him strike his
gallop, and let him go but once about one ring, ere you put him to his trot
again, and so let him trot about the other ring, and so I would have you
exercise him trotting about the one ring, and galloping about the other ring,
till you have brought him, that as soon as he has trotted about the one
ring, at the entering into the other, he will fall into an easy gallop of
himself: and so I would have you exercise him in trotting the one ring, and
galloping the other, till he be so perfect, that as soon as you but bend your
body forward, and give him the flat of your heel, he will presently fall into
an easy gallop: and ever when you feel him press forward of your hand, and
would go faster then you would have him, then stay him a little and let him
trot again, and that will bring him to gallop at a certain.

I would have you ever carry a faster hand of him in his trot, then in his
gallop: for that will make him carry light of your hand, which is one of the
chiefest things belonging to his gallop. For that horse that does tide chasing
and pressing upon the hand, does weary the arms and tire himself. But loving
son, give me that horse, that will ride of an easy gallop from the hand, and
so to the middle of his spend* and so to the very height of his speed:
always carrying light of your hand, and ever yield willingly to your hand
whenever you see occasion to take him up to give him a sobe, for that horse I
hold to be perfectly and truly mouthed, and rightly managed from the beginning.

All this is easily to be done if he be rightly mouthed at the beginning: but
if you do thrust him forth at the first, to gallop him furiously to the very
height of his speed, and so continue him but one week you will utterly spoil
him for ever for being at command: Therefore good loving Son mark this course
well, and carry it in your memory, and believe me it will do you much good in
your practice. And so I will come to the point where I left, that is, as often
as he does press hard of your hand in his gallop from the hand, that so often
you stay him gently, and put him to his trot again, and that in short time,
that he will seldom or never press hard of your hand, but will ever carry an
easy mouth and light upon your hand, and when he is brought to his perfection,
then I would have you to practice him to gallop from the hand as easily and
softly as you can possible make him strike his gallop, going round both the
rings, always carrying a gentle hand of him, for that will make him settle his
fore feet, and make him slip them foreward both comely and easily, and bring
his hinder legs close and round after him, for as the Colt that must be made
for the bit and great saddle, must be made to gallop high and lofty, so must
the hunting horse be brought to a slow and easy swimming gallop, as art can
afford, for commonly that horse that is short knit, and High filleted, does
prove the best hunter, for the strength of the back does carry it away at
length: and so the horse that is long and loosly knit, will commonly gallop
with his fore feet slubbering and stamping, and bring his hinder legs high and
unseemly after him, and will never prove good galloper.

And now to come to the matter again, I would have you exercise your horse
still as you did before, in the large rings, till you have brought him so
perfect, that he will fall into his gallop at the first setting forth, and go
so comely and easily as shall be to your liking, then you may take him into
some plain ground, of some ten or twelve acres, and there begin at a side to
gallop him round about, as large as you can; and when you have settled him into
his truestroake, then you may thrust him up into the middle of his speed, and
so continue him a pretty while, and that will make him gather himself up
roundly, and gather spirit into him, then check him up again, and bring him
into his easy and soft gallop, and so make an end at this time. Provided
always, that you leave him with an easy mouth and light reine, now when you
take him forth the next morning, then bring him into the same ground you had
him before, then put him into his swift trot a little, to settle his mouth to
your hand, then put him into his easy gallop, and fetch a large compass, and
make as large a double ring as you can, see that you bring him about of either
hand, for the larger he does gallop, the better may you set his legs and give
him his true stroke; and if at any time he do fall out of his stroke, then
presently put him into his trot, but half a dozen trots, and then put him into
his gallop again, and he will presently fall into his true stroke again;
and ever have a special care that you keep him large enough, for when he
does grow perfect in his gallop, he will desire to come in too fast; and if
you gallop him any long time, be sure to give him wind in due time, and give
him an easy hancke: when you think he has done well, then light of him, and
make much of him, and walk him up and down a little, then take his back
again, and put him to his gallop. And when he is settled in his right stroke,
then look down, and see whether his right leg lead or no, and if he lead
on the left leg, and not on the right; then the next morning take with you
one of the slips you had to make him trot, and when you begin to gallop him,
begin on the right hand, and first put the slip one his left set-locke, and
take it in your left hand; and if in his gallop he lead with his left leg,
then you may mark when he does set his left leg before, then you may even
in that very time when he does set his leg forth, give him a little twich
with your hand, and help him with your rod of the right shoulder, and
presently he will set the right leg before, and so you may continue that
help till he will lead with his right leg before, both of the right hand; and
of the left, and so when you have brought him to his perfect stroke of his
gallop, from the hand to the middle of his speed, and that he will perform
it readily, and willingly, then you may put him to gallop roundly of either
hand, in and out as you please, as shall come into your mind when you are
galloping. And when you have brought him to his voluntary gallop, and that he
willingly give you leave to hancke and loose at your pleasure, then you may
bein good hope that you have won his mouth for ever, and then you may take him
the next morning into some vnplow'd fallow field, that is redge and furrow, and
there begin to gallop him, and do not go even over them at the beginning, for
that will break his stroke mightily, but sloope him over side-way, till he
have gotten his true stroke, and that he will strike his furrow even and
just, and that he will set his forefoote ^ust in the furrow, for that you must
bring him (...) if ever you bring him to go over a field with a (...). for if
he set over the furrow (...) his back, and be a great deal (...) to him then
to set his fore-foote even (...) ^ow.

And when you have galloped him over so slooping, a quarter of a mile, then you
may turn him back again, and sloope him as much of the other hand, and when
he will strike his furrow even of either hand, then you may put him over the
lands, even forward; and when you have made him perfect in all these ways,
then I think you have finished his gallop for the field all manner of ways.

But loving Son, there is another round galloping lesson that I have
practiced much with three horses all at once, which I will by Gods leave teach
you the manner thereof; and about some thirty years agone, I and two of my
eldest sons, of three fine young horses, did gallop it on Malton Hill, and it
was highly commended, for it was never done in that place before.

First you must make three figures of eight, about ten paces of length, and of
a reasonable compass for the horses to turn in at the end thereof, and you
must cross these three figures one over another, as these figures does show
you: and you must set your horses one even against another all on a row, where
these horses shoes is set: then you must set one forward of a foot pace, and
when he is in the midst, then let another set forward whilst he is going about
the other ringe, then let the third set forward, whilst he is going about the
second ring, and let the third go about his ring, then let every one keep his
time upon a soft walk, and as one goes out, so let an other come in: and keep
time one after an other; and presently you shall hit it for it is just as you
do dance the hay; the old name of it is called the hedge dance, and so you
must exercise it of a soft pace till your horses will hit even one after an
other: as they will soon be perfect in the walk, then you may put them to
their trot, and make them trot it roundly and swiftly, and when they are
perfect in that, they will gallop it presently, both roundly, and readily. This
is a pretty pleasing lesson for three horses to exercise; and it is very good
for Gentlemen when they are met in the field in a cold morning, before the Hare
be a foot, to practice it to get them h^ate, and also in a morning when you
water your horses three together, when they have drunk to exercise it in some
plain ground, it is very good to warm their water in them.

Now good loving son, I pray you if you please to practice it, that you will
give it the name of Brownes Round, for that I think I was the first that ever
did practice it of the Snaffle.

Now loving son, that you have brought your horse to be perfect in all these
lessons heretofore set down upon the Snaffle, Musronle, and Martingale: I
would have you to take off the musroule, and martingale, and ride him with a
loose martingale, made in this manner as this figure does show you, and you
must carry it in your left hand, and bring it under your horses near
fore-legge, as this Picture does show of the other side: You must put these
loopes to the check of your snaffle, and you must carry it so loose, that he
scarcely feel it, unless he do offer to put out his nose, and if he do
carry his head close enough, you may take it from under his fore-legges, and
carry it in your left hand, as a false reyne and so use it at your pleasure.

CHAP. 7.
NOW loving Son, that I have here set down all the skill and knowledge that
I have gotten in fifty years practice, from the first haltering a Colt, from
on degree to another, till he be brought to gallop this round heretofore set
down. Now I will by Gods help set you down another, as true and infallible
away to pace and amble any horse sufficiently, and well, of what nature and
disposition soever he be of, and if you will diligently and carefully observe
these rules heretofore set down by me, you shall by Gods help, hit all and
miss none.

First, loving son I will begin to let you understand of all the ways that I
have practiced from the first beginning till this day.

First, I did practice to lead him down the hill, and check him under the
chin, that will make him set to an amble presently, but it will make him totter
with his end, and stamp with his fore-feete, and will make him set hard.

And I have used another way with long shoes with pikes before of three inches
long, that way will make him catch up his hinder legs unseemly as though he
had the wild Mares hinch.

I have used another way that is to wispe them of their hinder feet, above the
fet-locke, that way will make him straddle and go wide behind. I have used
another way, that is to work him in some deep ploughed ground, that way will
give him sore heates, and toil him and take of his mettle mightily.

But, loving Son, I have set down two ways that I have practiced this
thirty years, and I will never use other whilst I live, neither to my self,
nor to any that I shall teach, and these be the two ways.

First, I would have you take his back and try him how he is inclined, and go
to some rising ground and there thrust him up to the height betwixt his trot
and his gallop, and you shall presently see him fall into a shuffle, betwixt an
amble and a gallop, and if he will do so, then I would have you use no other
way with him but the hand and the heel, if you have any understanding to know
how to help him with the hand and heel, you may give him his pace so without
any other help. But if in trying him so, he will not make any offer or show of
a pace, then give him over and toil him no more, but go to him in this manner:

First, go and find out some even ground that is as ^eare the Stable as you
can, then bring him thither, and have a pair of Traues ready: I need not tell
the fashion of them for they are common in every town. I do use good strong
girth-w^b, and line it with broad-cloath list* but by the way, I would tell you
one secret, though known to some, yet most do not know it, and that is this,
when a horse does trot, he does ever take up his feet cross, that is, the far
foot before, and the near foot behind: and so the near fore foot, and the
far foot behind now is clean concontrary in the amble, for he must take up
both his feet of one side together: and now having brought your horse to the
even ground, you must first take up his fore foot, and put on one traue, and
make it fast a little above his foot lock, and then put another on his hinder
leg in the same place, and tie it also fast for slipping down, then take a
good strong coard of two fathom in length, and put it into the loops of your
traues, then measure some yeard or thereabouts, and double your coard, and tie
it to the middle girth of your saddle, then let there b^ some one with you with
a good long rod in his hand to put him forward to your hand, and to set him
straight to you, then take and lead him forward even as softly as you can
possible make him set his feet, and bear up his head hard with your hand, and
you shall see him lift both his legs together presently; by th^n you have gone
the length of your road, and seen him lift both his legs together, then
presently stay him, and make much of him: then lead him home again, in any
case, as softly as may be, till he has gotten the use of lifting both legs
together: then you shall see him ^^t his amble of one side, and let him stand
at every end of his rod to rest him, and cherish him, and give him some reward
ever when he does well: Then when he will go well on the one side, you may
put the trauers on the other side in the same manner that the other is put on,
but you must make it a good deal longer then the other is, so long as he
shall scarcely feel it, and then lead him up and down a pretty while, then
you may take them up shorter and shorter by a little and a little, till he will
set his amble of that side also; then let out the far trane, a handful or
there about and make them even, so as he set over both his hinder feet alike:
then you may exercise him so long till he be perfect, and will go fast in your
hand, then I would have you take an old horse, or any sober horse that will go
quietly by the other, and then take him and get on his back, and take the
other horse you are ambling by the reins loose in your hand, and get him to
go by you, even against you, and so you may exercise him without running by
him to toil you, for you must ply him till he be perfect in your hand, and
that he will amble by the horse you ride on after three miles an hour, and
when you have brought him to that perfectnes, then you may set an other on the
old horse, and you may get on the ambling horse, and you may put on a pair of
false reins to the snaffle, and take them in your hands, and let him that does
ride on the old horse, lead him as you did before, and so you may go up and
down the road with him till he go willingly of himself. Then you may take
the reins the other man carried in his hand, and hold them in your left hand
loose, and bear him all of your reins, and let the other man go by still till
he be something settled to go of himself, then you may venture to put him
forward to go by himself, and let the other man go from you, and so practice
him till he will go willingly, and then have a special care that he strike
his pace true and long; then begin to work up his head with your hand in this
manner: When you draw the right reine, make it bring the left side on, and when
you draw the left reine, it must bring the right side on, and ever when you
draw the right reine, help him with your left heel, and when you draw the
left reine, then help him with your right heel, and that will make him set his
pace long, and bring over his hinder legs further, for the further he sets
over, the fleighter will his pace be: you must labor him to get him to as long
a pace as you can, and when you have brought him that your hand and his legs
agree together, that is, that the right reine and the left leg, with help of
the left heel will come all together, and likewise the left reine and the
right leg, with help of the right heel come all together, then you may be in
good hope that you have got the true use of your hand to set his legs at your
pleasure.

CHAP. 8.
THen, loving Son, you may be in good hope that you may prove a sufficient
ambler: when you have brought you^ horse to that perfection, then I would have
you shift your traues from beneath the knee, and beneath the hough, and put
them above the knee and above the hough, then go to some vp-rise (as we term
it in Yorke-shire) or some climing ground that does rise reasonable high, there
put him up very softly, and use your hand to guide his legs as you did before of
the even ground, and when he is a little acquainted with the ground, you may
put him faster to it, and ever have a care to keep him long and true in his
place, for they be two principal rules; and ever when he does well, then fail
not to make much of him, and give him some reward, and you shall see that
within two or three days he will work so finely and comely up the hill, that
it will do you good to ride him: but always have a care to leave him when he
has done well, and in his willingness: and so when you have practiced him in
that manner with the Traues, and that you find him to go perfectly and well,
then take off one of them, and let him go with the other on, and when you have
him perfect, you may take off the other: and when you have taken off the other,
I would have you make in a readiness one pair of houghbands, made as this
figure does show you, and buckle them hard above the hough behind, then take
his back and put him up the road fair and softly, and if your hand and heel
will serve you to keep him in his true stroke, then you may proceed with him
and work him on: but if your hand will not serve to keep him where he was,
then I would have you presently to clap on the single Traue again, and so
practice him till he be so perfect as he will go willingly and true.

And if he does set over further of that side that the Traue is on, then he
does of the other, then shift the Traue on the other side, and that will help
him of that fault: And when you have brought him that he will go perfectly and
well, then take it off again; but before you take the traue off, you must put
him up to the height of his pace, and make him strike it out, a^^ ever as you
see him to grow upon your hand, and come on faster, when you come to the end of
your road, light off his back and lead him down and make much of him, and when
you have him so perfect that he will strike out to the height of his pace,
then venture to take it off, and say him loose with his hough-bands on.

In any case remember to give him but short roads, if he work to your hand
well when you begin to try him loose, put him to it very softly, and so proceed
faster as he does grow in perfectness. And when you have him that your hand
and his legs do agree altogether, then there is no doubt of your proceeding;
and then you may ease his hough-bands a little till he will go without them*
and when you assay him without them, put him up the road very softly, as you
did with his engines on. Now loving Son, to let you understand the benefit of
the hough-bands, is this; They do make him bring in his hinder legs close and
low after him, and will make him go comely in his pace, and also set forward
his hinder legs: and now when you have him working up the road loose, and that
he will set true and right, then put him on faster as you see him grow in
perfectness: but you must not thrust him up the road every time to the height
of his pace, but pace him softly three or four times, and the fifth time thrust
him up to the very height; for if you should put him up every time to the
height of his pace it would dull him and make him weary.

And you must not in any case, shift his road, until he be so perfect, that
when you offer to put him up to the height of his pace, he will fly up with it
so lightly and comely as you desire.

And loving Son, I would have you to be very careful and circumspect in this
point, for it is one of the chiefest principalls which belongs to the pace:
for there is small art in bringing any horse to the midst of his pace, but
there is great art and skill to bring a horse to his full pace, and that he will
go with it in any company: For, loving Son, I my self was but half a pacer
for the space of twenyeares, and had as many horses as I could turn me to,
with the help of two of my Sons, and was well paid for them: and I have met
them within a month after, and have seen them go of such a hiffe haffe, as
has been neither amble nor trot, which has grieved me much ^ and I could
never mend it until I got the skill to work them up the hill: for, loving
son, I will assure you, it is not to be done any way so well as that way: nor
to bring him to his changes, that is, from the height of his pace to his
gallop, and from his gallop to his pace again, and to shift from the one to
the other truly at your pleasure; for I would not give a pin for that pace
that will not keep company with any horse that he shall meet with, and to make
his change at your pleasure, that is, to go in his amble, in his gallop, and
in his trot at your pleasure: when you will have him shift from one to another,
then is he fit for any company: for the horse that is perfect in all these
three paces, the rider may say, Now I will ride of an ambling horse one mile,
and of a trotting horse another mile, and of a galloping horse the third mile.

And now loving son, when your horse will make his change from one to another
in his first road, then you may take him into another road that is something
lower rising then the first, and when you have him perfect in that, then you
may take him from that to another road, that is something lower then the
second, and when he is perfect in that, then you may bring him to the even
ground, and so perfect him in that, and then you have brought him to go on all
grounds: but you may not in any case shift him from the first road, to the even
ground at the first, for then you mar all, but you must bring him down by
degrees to the even ground, and that you have him perfect on the even ground,
you may take him to the highway, and ride him the first day one mile, and home
again, and the next two miles; and so as you see him grow in perfectness, so
you may take him further and further, till you have him so perfect that he will
go a days journey.

And when you do begin to travel him out a days journey, you must light
down often, and ease him so that he will tall to his pace again very
willingly, but if you keep him always at his pace, you will so tire him in
it, that he will have no desire to keep it, and you must as you are
traveling, ever when you come to some fair gravel ground for the purpose,
something rising, and of a good length, you may put him up to the height of his
pace, and so make him change truly to his gallop, and so keep him in his
gallop some twelve score, or there abouts, and then you must help him with
your hands, and bring him back to his amble again, and so you may exercise
him as you travel on the high way, to make him perfect of those two things,
and for his trot you need not trouble your self, for he will go to that of
himself, but you must not in any case put him out of his trot, into his
gallop, but you must bring him out of his trot, into his pace again, then you
may put him into his gallop, and so change him from his pace to his gallop at
your pleasure; and when you have brought him that he will perform all these
changes at your pleasure, then I think you have made him fit for the hye way,
and now that you have brought your horse from one degree to another till he be
perfect on the hye way. I will make hold to call you back again to your first
lesson where you began: And good loving son mark this point well, that is, to
have a special care of your horse at the first putting on of your single traue
that it be of a due length, neither too long nor too short, let it not be above
a yard at the most, and be very careful in leading of him with his head up,
and as softly as possibly you may make him go: For all the skill that belong
to the traue, is to give him a long stroke, and to understand how to give him
his helps in due time: I would have you practice this way till you be very
perfect herein, and observe the rules heretofore set down carefully, and when
you are perfect in this way, and that you find you grow perfect to lead his
legs right, and true, then I would have you begin to practice to work him up
the hill, with the traues above the knee, and above the hough; and practicing
so in short time your hand and heel will serve you to work any horse with the
traue on in that place, and when you find your hand serve you so well, then
you may venture to practice him loose up the hill with the hough bands of his
hinder legs, and so to come to work him loose without any engine, for now I
thank God my hand does serve me so well, that I do not traue one amongst seven.

But loving son, there is two lessons more, that I will teach you, which be
the cunningest lessons belong to an ambler; and the first is to be done in this
manner hereafter mentioned.

CHAP. 9.
FIrst loving son, I would have you bring your horse into some large ring, of
four or five score paces about, and put him into as fine and comely an amble,
as you possible can make him go in, then let him go two or three times about
the ring, then put him up to his fine hand Gallop, out of his pace, and let him
go other three times about, then take him up from his Gallop, and put him to
his proud and stately trot, that you made him before going loose before you, as
your Picture does show you, and that (as I term it) is the going of three
changes, and all in one round compass; and I think, if you have brought him
to ride all those three changes in that round compass, as often as you please
to put him to it, you have done as much to him of the snaffle as art can
afford.

CHAP. 10.
Loving son, the other lesson is this, having brought your horse to this
perfectness, and that he is truly paced rightly colored, and finely made,
and stately, and that he be for an Honorable man's Saddle, and that you must
set him on a Pad, and a Bit, you must begin with him in this manner: First,
when you have him at the length of his pace, that must be that he set his
hinder foot over his fore-foote three quarters of a yard at the least, then
you must begin to set him proud of your hand; and ever set him forward with
your rod, heel, and mouth, and you shall see him presently begin to cut his
pace, and to go proudly: you must make your road but short that you do ride
him in, that you may give him rest at every roades end; and you must have a
special care, that as you cut his pace short, that you make him set true, or
else you mar all: For you must bring him from three quarters of a yard over,
so far short till he come to set but one foot just over another, and must
set his pace as true as he did, when he set over the furthest, and when you
have cut his pace so short, you must let him rest there, for it is not possible
to cut it any shorter, and make him set true withal.

Now when you have brought him to his shortness of his pace, I would have you
you perfect him in that stately going till he will willingly, when you have him
at the length of his pace, if you but take up your reins, and thrust him
forward with your heel, and mouth, that he will go as proudly and as stately
as you will desire to have him; and now when you have brought him to this
perfectness, and that he must be set upon a Bit to bear a foot cloth in the
streets, it is fit you do bit him, for that you know how to keep him in his
true stroke with your hand, and you must bit him in this manner; If he be a
short fore-handed horse, the cheek of his Bit must be the longer, and if he
be long fore-handed, it must be the shorter, and when you do put the Bit into
his mouth, first you must take as small a hunting snaffle as you can get, and
put into his mouth first, and then you may put one the Bit, and let the curb
be at the full length at the first, and bear him at the first all of the
snaffle, that you may help him when need is: and so you may by a little at
once let him feel the curb, and so you may exercise him till he be perfect,
and when he does ^^now the curb, you may take it up shorter, as you see cause.

And so loving son, when you have brought him that he will go of his proud
and stately amble, and shift to his proud and stately trot, and shift from one
to another at your pleasure, then I think you have performed as much as is
possible to be done.

Now loving son, I will teach you to make your horse beat a curuet in the
stable: you must begin in this manner: You must first turn him backward in his
Stall, and set him upon two false reins, the^^ ^^ a pair of Pastornes on his
fore-feete, then take your prickle you had before, and prick him on the breast,
and he will presently rise up before, as you taught him in his proud trot, then
you must put on a pair of traues, as you see here, above the knee, and above
the hough, then turn him forward again, then let one be at his shoulder, and
give him the prick, and stand you behind him with another long prick, and
prick him on the side of his buttocke, and he will present rise behind, and
so you may take both the prick in your hands, and first thrust it to his
shoulders, and then to his buttockes, and he will presently rise before, and
behind, and beat it even.

The traues will make him keep his hinder legs close, and not yerke out this
lesson is good to exercise him in the stable when you bring him in from riding,
and after his water.

There is another lesson I will teach you, that is as needful, that is to make
your horse kneel down when you would have him. You must begin in this manner,
you must turn him back in the stall, and strew litter enough under him, then
put a long slip to his foot-locke on his farre-foote, then put an other on his
near foot, then take the slip on the far side, and bring it over his wythers,
then with your right hand draw his leg up a good way from the ground, then
hold it fast, then draw the other leg up withal your strength, and bid him
couch, and he will presently kneel down on both his knees, then when he is
down, make him kneel a good pretty while, then let him rise again, and make
much of him, then you may exercise him so still, till he be so perfect that
he will kneel down when you strike him one the knees with your rod, and bid
him couch: this lesson is good for a high way horse, when the Rider is weary,
to light.

Now there is another lesson to teach your horse, that is this, to make him
follow you any manner of way you go; you must teach it him in this manner.
First, you must keep him very sharp for one day, and a night, and give him
nothing but straw in his rack, then come to him the next morning, and tie a
long slip to his collar, then take a good quantity of oats in your
prouand-dish, and go to him and let him feel them, and then go a good pretty
way from him, and shake the oats in the dish, and bid him, Come, come, and if
he will not come, then go near him, and draw a little from him, and he will
come presently; and so you must practice him, till when you loose him from the
manger, and shake your oats, he will come to you.

Then you may go out off the door, and let him follow you loose in some
Court, where he cannot get out, and so you may make him follow you any way
wheresoever you go, and then you may put a piece of bread in your boot, or
shoe, and the taste of it will make him love you exceedingly, and blowing into
his nostrills will help much.

CHAP. 11.
AND now, loving Son, for Farriership I have no skill, neither will I set
down any thing, but what I have tried by my own experience, and sore pains
taken this fifty years.

But I will set down three serets, that is very fitting for either Rider or
Groom to know, and these be they.

To make a Star in any dark colored horses forehead, or sneepe in his nose,
or in any part of his face and body.

The second is, to make roules to get a cold from any horse that is new taken.

The the third is, to kill any scratches, or sore heels whatsoever.

For the first, you must make a bodkin in this manner heretofore set down, and
two pricks in the same manner, and where you would have the star, there you
must thrust in your bodkin, and bring it forth again some quarter of an inch
above where you put it in, then you must take your bodkin forth, and put in one
of your pricks; then you must make another hole cross over the other prick,
then take four yeards of fine two-peny-bredth Inkle, and wrap it about in this
manner, as you see this sample, and when you have wrapped the one half, then
cross it as you see this figure, some twice or thrice about all the four
ends, and then go on still and wrap as you did before, and tie it fast at one
end, and let it be on four and twenty hours, and then unwrap the Inkle and
take out the pricks, and close the skin with the ball of your hand, and
anoint it with hot butter once when you take them out, and again within two or
three days after: and so do no more to it, for the skin will come on it, and
it will be a very fair white.

You must make your medicine for the cold in this manner:

You must get a handful of Box, a handful of Rue, a handful of Rosemary, and
a Garlic head, and chop all these small together, and take so much fresh
butter as will serve to roll them in, then make nine small roules thereof, a
little bigger then a Wall-nut, and give him three in a morning, and so every
other morning three, and warm him lightly after you have given him them, and
set him up very warm, and cast a warm blanket upon him.

For the killing of the Scratches, you must take four pennyworth of white
Copperis, one handful of bay salt, and boil them in small bear wort, till it
be something thick, then put it in a pot, and clip the hair bare, that the
water may go in, and when you dress him, rub it in well that it may go to
the bottom, and dress him morning and euenining, and keep his legs dry,
and it will presently kill the disease.

I have one secret more, which shows how you may have a Horse-coult, or a
Mare-coult at your pleasure.

When you would have a Horse-colt of your Mare, observe this rule: There are
twelve signs, six Male, and six Female; and if you would have a horse Colt,
you must put your Mare to the Horse in one of the male Signs and it will be a
horse Coult. So likewise for a Mare Coult, you must observe it by the osix
Signs which are contrary.

CHAP. 12.
SO now (loving Son) I have troubled you with a great deal of reading, for a
small deal of matter, but I must desire you to bear with an old memory, for
the old saying is, as age comes on, so memory decays. I will now only set you
down a brief of all the principal rules, in order, as I have observed them
in this book.

The first is, To make a true and perfect mouth.

The second is, to make a proud, stately, and comely reyne.

The third is, to make a proud and stately trot, which must be done with round
balls of wood, six or seven inches in compass, and made fast under his
fetlocke, as is showed in his place.

The fourth is, to make a full sufficient highway pace.

The fifth is, to make a proud stately short pace for a street.

The sixth is, to make a fine comely and easy gallop, either for hunting, or
for the highway, and that he will make all his three changes in a large ringe,
that is upon his pace, trot, and gallop, and that he will perform all these
changes in those rings heretofore set down, and that he will do them all
without any disorder.

Then loving Son, if you will practice to get all these grounds here by me set
down, you shall be accounted as sufficient a Snaffle-man as most is in England.

Vale.
