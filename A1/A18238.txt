AT LONDON, Printed by H. L. for Thomas Man, 1612.

TO MY REVErend and worthy Brother, Mr. Doctor HALL.
THe wise Merchant, that after long travel with much searching and
aduenturing, does think that he has found some rich treasure, although he do
much rejoice in it, yet will not trust himself; but will use all means of
trial of it, by the most skillful and expert, before he will adventure his
estate, upon an uncertain commodity, or offer any way to vent the same. Blame
me not then (my reverend and dearest Brother) if after trial of this kind of
translation, by my self and others, I crave of you to be in stead of many,
for bringing it unto the touch; to try, whether it be in all things, according
to the worth, which I have conceived of it, for carrying-on the little ones in
so plain and so pleasant a way to all good learning. For, whom can I find
more meet then your self? And first, in regard of that right noble Hope, to
whom I have Dedicated my first assay in this kind, being as yet unable to
iugde thereof; considering your louingest affection so duly and publicly
testified to that honorable House. Secondly, in regard of the general sort,
to whom you have not more approved your love, in your painful and worthy
labors, then they in their glad embracing of the same. And for me, Who has
ever witnessed more true and sound affection, first in comforting and
supporting your faithfullest sister, in that her long and weary combat of so
many years together, against the manifold terrors, assaults and tortures of
the bloody Enemy? and that not only privately by your tenderest Letters, but
publikelie in that most sweet Epistle, which has been for the comfort of many
a fainting soul. Wherein, you did not leave her destitute of your brotherly
consolations, until the Lord who strengthened her, to be faithful unto the
death, had vouchsafed unto her a most glorious victory; and translating her
into his throne, from all the malice of the Dragon, gave unto her the Crown of
life. Also for mine own self, since, as I have acquainted you, and some other
of chief note and place, with all my Schoole-trauells, from the time that I
thus set my self more earnestly unto them, so with this kind of
Grammatical translation in particular, from my very first entering into them;
and more specially of late with the controversy concerning the same: so that
you are fulli^ able to satisfy any, as I hope; and by your wisdom to compose
it in peace. That th^re may be still a joint union in this labor, which I
trust will prove so profitable to all. And moreover, for that you have not
refused to put-to your helping hand to the work, perusing, and adding some of
your own experiments; and have also seen some little trial of my beginnings,
and by all means encouraged me hereunto. Lastly, for that you have now
vouch^afed to grace my weak endeavors, with your loving though undeserved
testimony. Wherefore, my kindest Brother, as you have witnessed all this
love; so let me entreat you especially, amongst others, in these and all
other my studies for our poor Coun^reyschooles, to help (as your greater
occasions shall permit) to sever all the dross, that nothing may remain, but
only that which is pure and will abide the touch; That in the end, that
which is approved may come footh as the gold, which has seven times passed
the fire. The Latin Commentary of Corderius, which I lately met withal,
has much confirmed me in the course; though the English translation, joined
to it, does very often translate the exposition, not the text. Notwithstanding,
Fear least I should deceive my self or any other, or least I should faint in
the way, leaving the work undone, together with the good experience of your
tender love, so carefully supporting me, and so brotherly censuring and
directing in such mildness, and also accepting my willingness, makes me thus
to presume. The fruit, I trust, shall be for yours, amongst others. And in this
hope, that you will esteem of so mean a gift, according to mine affection, not
the work, I commend it unto your love, and to the blessing of our most wise
and holy GOD whose it is; remaining ever,

Your thankful though unworthiest Brother, I. B.

TO THE IVDIcicus Reader.
LEarned Reader, if you perceive the benefit of this kind of translating, help
lovingly to amend what is amiss. Future editions (God willing) shall supply
what is wanting, and bring to more perfection.

To the Learner.
1. B^ careful first to be ready in the Grounds of your Accidence and Grammar,
at least to have the perfect understanding of them; and to be very cunning in
the examples of Nounes and Verbes, also to have very readily the Rule of
construing. For your better direction herein, see the questions of the
Accidence and Grammar, called The Posing of the Parts, gathered of purpose to
help thereto. 2. In using these translations, labor ever, first, to understand
fully the matter of every sentence which you would construe, by often reading
over the English, to get it (as it were) without book. 3 Then learn to
construe the Latin according to the rule of construing, using the book where
you doubt, and to the end to go surely and speedily. 4 Next, to parse as you
construe, being helped by the Latin and English together. 5. After, try to
construe and parse out of the English alone, looking only on it: whereby you
continually make Latin. 6. Lastly, prove whether by often reading-ouer the Latin
out of the English (first, according to the order of the translation; after,
according to the order of the Author) both Latin and matter will not most
speedily be made your own.
Understand the matter perfectly; and the Latin will flow most easily, as of
the own accord.
For the use of this Book, see the Grammar-schoole, Chap. 8. in the manner, use
and benefits of Grammatical translations.
