FINIS.
TO MY HONORABLE FRIEND, SR. THOMAS MOVNSON, KNIGHT AND BARONET.
SInce now those clouds, that lately ouer-cast
Your Fame and Fortune, are dispersed at last:
And now since all to you fair greetings make,
Some out of love, and some for pitties sake:
Shall I but with a common style salute
Your new enlargement? or stand only mute?
I, to whose trust and care you durst commit
Your pined health, when Art despayr'd of it?
I, that in your affliction often viewed
In you the fruits of manly fortitude,
Pati^nce, and even constancy of mind,
That Rocke-like stood, and scorned both wave, and wind?
Should I for all your ancient love to me*
Endowed with weighty favors, silent be?
Your merits, and my gratitude forbid
That either should in Lethean Gulf lie hid
But how shall I this work of fame expre^^e?
How can I better, after pensiveness,
Then with light straynes of Music, made to move
Sweetly with the wide-spreading plumes of love?
These youth-borne Airs then, imprisoned in this Book,
Which in your Bowres much of their being took,
Accept as a kind offering from that hand
Which joined with heart your virtue may command.
Who love a sure friend as all good men do,
Since such you are, let those affect you to:
And may the joys of that Crown never end,
That innocence does pity, and defend. --
Yours devoted, THOMAS CA^PIAN.

^
Often have I sighed, often have I sighed, often have I
^
^
sighed for him that hears me not: Who ab^^nt has both love and me for-got.
^
^
Oh yet I languish still, yet I languish still, yet I languish still through
his de-lay.
^
^
Days seem as years, when wished friends break their day.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
^ (...) he but loved as common lovers use,
His faithless stay some kindness would excuse:
O yet I languish still, still constant mo^rne
For him that can break vows, but not return.
^
NOw let her change and spare not, Since ^he proves strange I care not: Feigned
love charmed so
^
^
my de-light, That still I doted on her sight. But she is gone new ^oies
embracing And my deires dis-gracing.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
When did I err in blindness?
Or vex her with unkindness?
If my cares served her alone;
Why is she thus untimely gone?
True love abides to t'houre of dying;
False love is eu^^^ving.
3
False then farewell for ^u^r:
Once false proves faithful never.
He that boasts now of thy lou^,
Shall soon my pr^^ent to^tunes prove.
Were he as fair at bright Ad^mu;
Faith is not had where none ^^.
CANTVS. III.

Patience is a thing d^

uine, and far I grant a-boue me.
^
BASSVS.

2
Foes sometimes be friend us more, our blacker deeds obiecting,
Then th'obs^quious bosom guest, with false respect affecting:
Friendship is the glass of Truth, our hidden stains detecting.
3
While I use of eyes enjoy, and inward light of reason,
Thy obseruer will I be, and c^^sor, but in season:
Hidden mischief to conc^^^e in Sease, and Love is (...) o^.
^
Maids are simple some men say, They forsooth will trust no men:
^
^
But should they men's wills o. bey, Maids were very simple then.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Truth a rare flower now is grown,
Few men wear it in their hearts;
Lovers are more easily known
By their follies, then deserts.
3
Safer may we credit give
To a faithless wandering Jew,
Then a young man's vows believe,
When he swears bis (...) ue.
2
Love they make a poor blind child,
But let none trust such as Fee;
Rather then to be begun'd
Ever let me simple be.
CANTVS. V.
^
SO tired are all my thoughts, that sense and spirits fail; Mourning I pine,
and
^
^
know not what I ayle. O what can yield ease to a mind, toy in nothing that
can find?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
How are my powers sore-spoke? what strange distaste is this?
Hence cruel hate of that which sweetest is:
Come, come delight, make my dull brain
Feel once heat of joy ag^^ne.
3
The lovers tears are sweet, their moner makes them so:
Proud of a wound the bleeding Soldiers grovs:
Poor I alone, dreaming, endure
Grief that knows nor cause, nor cure.
And whence can all this grow? even from an idle mi^de,
That no delight in any good can find.
Action alone makes the soul blessed;
Virtue dies with too much reft.
^
WHy presumes thy pride on that that must so private be? Scarce that it can
Best of all that
^
^
good be called, though it seems best to thee.
Nature framed, or cu-rious eye can see.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
It Is thy beau'y, soc'^sh Maid, that like a blossom grows,
Which who viewes no more enioyes then on a bush a Rose,
That by manies handling fades; and thou (...) one of those.
3
If to one thou sh^lt prove true, and all beside reject,
Then art thou but one man's good, which yields a poor effect;
For the common'st good by larre deserves the best respect.
4
But if for this goodness thou thy selte ^^lt^ common make,
Thou art then not good at all; so thou can no way (...)
But to prove the meanest good, or else all good fortake.
5
Be not then of be ^^ry proud, but so her colors bears,
That they prove not ^taines to her that them ^or (...) should we^^^;
So shall thou to all more fair then thou west borne appear.
CANTVS. VII.
^
Kind are her answers, but her per-formance keeps no day. All her free favors
and smooth words
Breaks time as dancers from their own Music when they stray:
^
^
wing my hopes in vain. O did ever voice so sweet but only fain? Can true love
yield such delay, conuer-ting joy to pain?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Lost is our freedom,
When we submit to women so:
Why do we need them,
When in their best they work our woe?
There is no wisdom
Can alter ends by Fate prefixed;
O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
Never were days yet ca 'd two,
But one night went betwixt.
^
O Grief, O spite, to see poor Virtue scorned, Truth far ex- n'd, False art
loved:
^
^
Vice a-dor'd, Fr^e Justice sold, worst causes best adorned, Right cast by
Power, Pity in vain implot'd!
^
^
O who in such an age could wish to live, When none can have or hold but such
as give?
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
2
O times' O men! to Nature rebels grown;
Poor in desert; in name rich; proud of shame;
Wise, but in ill: your styles are not your own,
Though dearly bought, honor is honest fame.
Old Stories only goodness now contain,
And the true wisdom, that is just, and plain.
(...)
^
O Ne-uer to be moved, O beau-ty un relen-ting; Why did I dream
Hard heart too dearly loved, Fond love too late repen-ting!
^
^
of too much bliss? Deceitful hope was cause of this. O hear, o hear, o
bear me speak, O
^
^
hear me speak this and no more, this and no more, this and no more, Live
you in joy, while I
^
^
my woes, my woes de-plore.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
2
All comforts despayred
Distaste your bitter scorning,
Great sorrows vnrepayred
Admit no mean in mourning:
Dye wretch, since hope from thee is fled;
He that must dye is better dead.
O dear delight, yet ere I dye
Some pity show, though you relief deny.
CANTVS. X.
^
Break now my heart and dye, Oh no, oh no, she may re-lent. Should she now
Let my de-spaire prevail, oh stay, oh stay, hope is not spent.
^
^
fix one smile on thee, where were despair? The loss is but ea-sie which
smiles can repair.
A stranger would please thee, if she were as fair
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Her must I love or none, so sweet none breathes as she,
The more is my despair, alas she loves not me:
But cannot time make way for love through ribs of steel?
The Grecian enchanted a^l parts but the heel,
At last a shaft daunted which his heart did feel.
CANTVS. XI.
^
IF Love loves truth, then women do not love: Their passions all are but
dis-sembled shows,
Now kind and free of favor if they prove. Their kindness straight a tempest
o-uerthrowes.
^
^
Then as a Seaman the poor lover fares, The storm drownes him ere he can
drown his cares.
BASSVS.
^
2
But why accuse I women that deceive?
Blame then the Foxes for their subtle wile:
They first from Nature did their craft receive:
It is a woman's nature to begu^le.
Yet some I grant in loving steadfast grow;
But such by use, are made, not nature so.
O why had Nature power at once to frame
Deceit and Beauty, traitors both to Love?
Oh would Deceit had dyed when Beauty came
With her divineness every heart to move!
Yet do we rather wish what ere befall,
To have fair women false, then none at all.
^
NOw winter nights en-large the number of their hours, And clouds their
Let now the chimneys blaze, and cups o'er-flow with wine: Let well-tuned
^
^
storms dis-charge vp-on the ayrie towers, Now yel-low waxen lights shall
wait on hunny
words a-maze with har-mo-nie di-uine.
^
^
Love, While youthful Revels, Masks, and Courtly sights, sleeps leaden spells
re-moue.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
This time does well dispense
With lovers long discourse;
Much spe^ch has some defense,
Though beauty no remorse.
All do not all things well;
Some measures comely tread;
Some knotted Ridles tell;
Some Poems smoothly read.
The Summer has his joys,
And Winter his delights;
Though Love and all his pleasures are but toys,
They shorten tedious nights.
(...)
^
AWake thou spring of spea-king grace, mute rest becomes not thee;
They fay-rest women, while they sleep, and Pictures e-quall be.
^
^
O come and dwell in loves dis^our-ses, old re-nuing, new cre-a-ting.
The words which thy rich tongue discour-ses, are not of the common ra-ting.

Thy voice is ^s an ^^cho clear^, which Music does beget;
Thy spee^^ is ^n Or^^^, which no^e can coun^et^t:

And I co^d hear (...) w^^^out ending,

But language is our proper grace ^^om which they ^^uer dare.

If speech be then the best of ^^aces,

BASSVS.

2
If weary, they prepare us rest; if sick, their hand attends us.
When with grief our hearts are preft, their comfort best befriends us:
Sweet or sour they willing go to share what fortune sends us.
3
What pretty babes with pain they bear our name and torm presenting?
What we get, how wise they keep, by sparing, wants preventing;
Sorting all their household cares to our observed contening.
4
All this of whose large use I sing, in two words is exp^sle*
Good wife is the good I praise, if by good men possessed,
Bad with bad in ill fate well, but good with good ^ue (...).
CANTVS. XV.
^
FIre that must flame is with apt fuel fed, Flowers that will thrive in sunny
soil are bred;
^
^
How can a heart feel heat that no hope finds? Or can he love on whom no
comfort shines?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Fair, I confess there is pleasure in your sight:
Sweet, you have power I grant of all delight.
But what is all to me if I have none'
Churl that you are t'inioy such wealth alone.
3
Prayers move the heavens, but find no grace with you;
Yet in your looks a heavenly form I view:
Then will I pray again, hoping to find
As well as in your looks, heaven in your mind.
4
Saint of my heart, Queen of my life, and love,
O let my vows thy doing spirit move:
Let me no longer mourn through thy disdain,
But with one touch of grace cure all my pain:
CANTVS. XVI.
^
IF thou longst so much to learn (sweet boy) what it is to love. Little suit at
first shall win
Do but fix thy thought on me, and thou shall quick-ly prove.
^
^
Way to thy a-basht desire: But then will I hedge thee in, Salamander-like with
fire.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
With thee dance I will, and sing, and thy fond dalliance bear;
We the grouy hil^ will climb, and play the wantons there.
Other whiles we will gather flowers,
Lying dalying on the grass,
And thus our delightful hours
Full of waking dreams shall pass.
3
When thy joys were thus at height my love should turn from thee,
Old acquaintance then should grow as strange as strange might be,
Twenty rituals thou should find
Breaking all their hearts for me,
When to all i will prove more kind,
And more forward then to thee.
4
Thus thy silly youth enraged would soon my love d^f^e;
But alas poor soul too late, clips wings can never fly
Those sweet hours which we had pi^t
Called to mind thy heart would burn:
And could thou fly never so fast,
They would make thee straight return.
(...) XVII.
^
SHall I come sweet Love to thee, When the eu'ning beams are set?
^
^
Shall not ex-cluded be? Will you find no fained let? Let me not for pit-ty
^
^
more, Tell the long, long hours, tell the long hours at your door.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Who can tell what thief or foe,
In the covert of the night,
For his prey will work my woe;
Or through wicked foul despite:
So may I dye vnredrcft,
Ere my long love be possessed.
3
But to let such dangers pasle,
Which a lovers thoughts disdain:
It Is enough in such a place
To attend loves joys in vain,
Do not mock me in thy bed,
While these cold nights freeze me dead.
CANTVS. XVIII.
^
THrice toss these Oaken ashes in the air; Then thrice three times tie
Thrice sit thou mute in this in-chanted chair:
^
^
up this true loves knot, And murmur soft she will, or she will not.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Go burn these poisonous weeds in you blew fire,
These Screech-owles feathers, and this prickling bryer,
This Cypress gathered at a dead man's grave;
That all thy fears and cares an end may have.
3
Then come you Fayries, dance with me a round,
Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound:
In vain are all the charms I can devise,
She has an Art to break them with her eyes.
CANTVS. XIX.
^
BE thou then my beauty named, Since thy will is to be mine: Others
For by that am I en-flamed, Which on all a-like does shine.
^
^
may the light ad-mire, I only truly feel the fire.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
But if lofty titles move thee,
Challenge then a Sou'raignes place:
Say I honor when I love thee,
Let me call thy kindness grace.
State and Love things diverse be,
Yet will we teach them to agree.
3
Or if this be not sufficing;
Be thou styled my Goddess then:
I will love thee sacrificing,
In thine honor Hymns I Will pen.
To be thine, what can thou more?
I Will love thee, serve thee, and adore.
CANTVS. XX.
^
FIre, fire, fire, fire, lo here I burn, I burn in such desire* That all
^
^
the tears that I can strain out of mine idle empty brain, Cannot al-lay my
scorching pain.
^
^
Come Trent and Humber, and fair Thames, Dread Ocean haste with all thy
streams: And
^
^
if you can-not quench my fire, O drown both (...) drown both me, and my
de-sire.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
2
Fire, fire, fire, fire.
There is no hell to my desire:
(...) all the Rivers backward fly,
And the Ocean does his waves deny,
For fear my heat should drink them dry.
Come heavenly showers then poaring (...):
Come you that once the world did drow^e:
Some then you spared, but now save all,
That else must burn, and with me fall.
CANTVS. XXI.
^
O Sweet delight, O more then humane bliss, With her to live that
^
^
ever loving is: To hear her speak whose words so well are placed, That she
by them, as they in
^
^
her are graced: Those looks to view that feast the viewers eye. How blessed is
he that
^
^
may so live and dye?
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Such love as this the golden times did know,
When all did reap, yet none took care to sew:
Such love as this an endless Summer makes,
And all distaste from frail affection takes.
So loved, so blessed, in my beloved (...) I,
Which till their eyes a^^e let iron men envy.
(...) XXII.
^
THus I resolve and time has taught me so, Since she is
^
^
fair and e-uer kind to me, Though she be wild and wanton-like in show,
Those little
^
^
stains in youth I will not see: That she be constant heaven I often im-plore; If
^
^
prayers prevail not, I can do no more.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
2
Palm tree the more you press, the more is grows,
Leave it alone it will not much exceed:
Free beauty if you strive to yoke, you lose,
And for affection strange distaste you breed.
What Nature has not taught no Art can frame;
Wild borne be wild still, though by force made (...).
CANTVS. XXIII.
^
Come, O come my life's de-light; Let me not in langour, pine^
^
^
Love loves no de-lay: thy sight, The more en-ioy'd, the more di-uine. O
^
^
come and take from me The pain of being deprived of thee.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Thou all sweetness do enclose,
Like a little world of bliss:
Beauty guards thy looks, the Rose
In them pure and eternal is.
Come then and make thy flight
As swift to me as heavenly light.
CANTVS. XXIIII.
^
COuld my heart more tongues im-ploy, Then it har-bors thoughts of grief;
It is now so far from joy, That it fearce could ask re-liefe.
^
^
Truest hearts by deeds vn-kinde, To despair are most en-clin'd.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Happy minds that can redeem
Then engagements how they please;
That no joys, or hopes esteem
Half so precious as their ease.
Wisdom should prepare men so
As if they did all fore know.
3
Yet no Art or Caution can
Grown affections easily change;
Use is such a Lord of Man,
That he brooks worst what is strange.
Better never to be blessed,
Then to loose all at the best.
CANTVS. XXV.
^
Sleep angry beauty, sleep, and fear not me; For who a sleeping Ly-on dares
provoke?
It shall suf-fice me here to sit and see Those lips shut up that never kindly
spoke.
^
^
What sight can more con-tent a lovers mind, Then beauty seeming harmless if
not kind?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
My words have charmed her, for secure she sleeps,
Though guilty much of wrong done to my love;
And in her slumber see she close-ey'd weeps,
Dreams often more then waking passions move.
Plead sleep my cause, and make her soft like thee,
That she in peace may wake and pity me.
CANTVS. XXVI.
^
SIlly boy, it is full Moon yet, Thy night as day shines clearly, Had thy youth
but
^
^
wit To fear, thou could not love so deare-ly: Shortly will thou mourn when
all thy pleasures are be-
^
^
reaued; Little knows he how to love that never was de-cei-ued.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
This is thy first maiden flame that triumphs yet unstained;
All is artlesse now you speaks, not one word yet is feigned;
All is heaven that you behold, and all your thoughts are blessed:
But no Spring can want his Fall, each Troyless has his Crossoid.
3
Thy well-ordered locks ere long shall rudely hang neglected;
And thy lively pleasant cheer, reads grief on earth dejected:
Much then will thou blame thy Saint that made thy heart so holy.
And with sighs confeste, in love, that too much faith is folly.
4
Yet be just and constant still, Love may beget a wonder;
Not unlike a Summers frost, or Winters fatal thunder:
He that holds his Sweet-hart true unto his day of dying,
Lives of all that ever breathed most worthy the ^^^ying.
(...) XXVII.
^
Never love unless you can Bear with all the faults of man: Men sometimes will
^
^
Jealous be, Though but little cause they see, And hang the head as
discon-tent, And speak what
^
^
straight they will re-pent.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Men that but one Saint adore,
Make a show of love to more:
Beauty must be scorned in none,
Though but truly served in one;
For what is courtship but disguise?
True hearts may have dissembling eyes.
3
Men when their affairs require,
Must a while themselves retire;
Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawke,
And not ever fit and talk.
If these and such like you can bear,
Then like, and love, and never fear.
CANTVS. XXVIII.
^
SO quick, so hot, so mad is thy fond fute, So rude, so
That feign I would with loss make thy tongue mute, And yield some
^
^
te-dious grown in urging me. An hour with thee I care not to con-verse: For
I would not
lit-tle grace to quiet thee.
^
^
be coun-ted too perverse.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
But roofes too hot would prove for men all fire,
And hills too high for my unused pace;
The grove is charged with thorns and the bold bryer;
Gray Snakes the meadows shrowde in every place:
A yellow Frog alas will fright me so
As I should start and tremble as I go.
3
Since then I can on earth no fit room finds,
In heaven I am resolved with you to meet;
Till then for Hopes sweet sake reft your tired mind,
And not so much as see me in the street:
A heavenly meeting one day we shall have,
But never, as you dream, in bed, or grave.
CANTVS. XXIX.
^
SHall I then hope when faith is fled? Can I seek love when
^
^
hope is gone? Or can I live when Love is dead? Poorly he lives that
^
^
can love none. Her vows are broke, and I am free, She lost her faith in
loo-sing me.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
^
2
When I compare mine own events,
When I weigh others like annoy;
All do but heap up discontents,
That on a beauty build their joy.
Thus I of all complain, since she^
All faith has lost in loosing me.
3
So my dear freedom have I gained,
Through her unkindness, and disgrace,
Yet could I ever live enchain'd,
As she my service did embrace.
But sh^^^ i^ changed, and I am free,
Faith failing her, Love dyed in me.
TO MY WORTHY FRIEND, MR. JOHN MOVNSON, Son and Heir to Sir Thomas Mounson
Knight and Baronet.
ON you the affections of your Fathers Friends,
With his Inheritance by right descends;
But you your graceful youth so wisely guide,
That his you hold, and purchase much beside.
Love is the fruit of Virtue, for whose sake
Men only liking each to other take.
If sparks of virtue shined not in you then,
So well how could you win the hearts of men?
And since that honor and well-suted Praise
Is Virtues Golden Spur; let me now raise
Unto an act mature your tender age,
This half commending to your Patronage:
Which from your Noble Fathers, but one side
Ordained to do you honor, does divide.
And so my love betwixt you both I part,
On each side placing you as near my heart.
Yours ever, THOMAS CAMPIAN.

To the READER.
THE Apothecaries have Books of Gold, whose leaves being opened are so light
as that they are subject to be shaken with the least breath, yet rightly
handled, they serve both for ornament and use; such are light Airs. But if any
squeamish stomachs shall check at two or three vain Ditties in the end of
this Book, let them power off the clearest, and leave those as dregs in the
bottom. How soever if they be but conferred with the Canterbury Tales of that
venerable Poet Chaucer, they will then appear toothsome enough. Some words are
in these Books, which have been clothed in Music by others, and I am
conten^ they then served their turn: yet give me now leave to make use of
mine own. Likewise you may find here some three or four Songs that have
been published before, but for them I refer you to the Players Bill that is
failed, Newly revived with Additions, for you shall find all of them reformed
either in Words or Notes. To be brief, all these Songs are mine if you
express them well, otherwise they are your own, Farewell.

Yours as you are his, THOMAS CAMPIAN.

Such scoffing me, or pitying me, say thus,
Had he not loved he might have lived like us.
O then dear sweet for love and pittits sake
My faith reward, and from me scandal take.

BASSVS.

2
It Is childish to be caught with Pearl, or Amber,
And woman-like too much to cloy the chamber;
Youths should the Field affect, heat their rough Steedes
Their hardened nerves to fit for better deeds.
Is It not more joy strong Holds to force with swords,
Then women's weakness take with looks or words?
2
Men that do noble things all purchase glory,
One man for one brave Act has proved a story:
But if that one ten thousand Dames o'creime,
Who would record it if not to his shame?
It Is far more conquest with one to live true,
Then every hour to triumph Lord of new.
CANTVS. IIII.
^
Veil love mine eyes, O hide from me The plagues that charge the curious mind:
^
^
If beauty private will not be, Suffice it yet that she proves kind. Who can
vsurp heavens light alone?
^
^
Stars were not made, Stars were not made to shine on one.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Griefs past recure fools try to heal,
That greater harms on less inflict:
The pure offend by too much zeal,
Affection should not be too strict.
He that a true embrace will find
To beauties faults must still be blind.

EV'-ry Dame af-fects good fame, what ere her doings be: But true praise is

Borrowed guise fits not the wife, a simple look is best: Na-tiue grace becomes

^
^
That before the year grows old the new-est fashion dies.

BASSVS.
^
^
2
Dames of yore contended more in goodness to exceeds,
Then in pride to be enui'd for that which leaft they need:
Little Lawne then feru'd the Pawn, it Pawn at all there were;
Homespun thread, and household bread then held out all the year:
But th'attyres of women now wear out both house and land,
That the wives in silks may flow at ebb the Good-men stand.
3
Once again Astrea then from heaven to earth descend,
And vouchsafe in their behalf these errors to amend:
Aid from heaven must make all eeu'n, things are so out of frame;
For let man strive all he can, he needs must please his Dame.
Happy man content that gives, and what he gives enioyes;
Happy Dame content that lives, and breaks no sleep for toys.
^
SO sweet, so sweet is thy dis-course to me, And so de-lightfull is thy
^
^
sight, As I taste no-thing right but thee. O why inuen-ted Na-ture light? Was

beauties sake, That her graced words might better take?

BASSVS.

2
No more can I old joys recall,
They now to me become unknown,
Not seeming to have been at all.
Alas how soon is this love grown
To such a spreading height in rise,
As with it all must shadowed be?
^
THere is a Garden in her face, Where Roses and white Lil-lies grow;
^
^
A heavenly paradise is that place, wherein all pleasant fruits do flow. There
Cherries
^
^
grow which none may buy, Till Cherry ripe, till Cherry ripe, till Cherry ripe,
Cherry ripe, ripe, ripe, Cherry
^
^
ripe, Cherry ripe themselves do cry.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Those Cherries fayrely do enclose
Of Orient Pearl a double row,
Which when her lovely laughter shows,
They look like Role-buds filled with snow,
Yet them nor Peer, nor Prince can buy,
Till Cherry ripe themselves do cry.
3
Her Eyes like Angels watch them still;
Her Brows like bended bows do stand,
Threatening with piercing frowns to kill
All that attempt with eye or hand
Those sacred Cherries to come nigh,
Till Cherry ripe themselves do cry.

TO his sweet Lute A-pol-lo sung the mo-tions of the Spheres;
^

The wondrous order of the Stars, whose course diuides the years: And all the
My-steries above;

But none of this could Midas move, Which purchased him his Asses ears.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
Then Pan with his rude Pipe began the Country-wealth t'aduance;
To boast of Cattle, flocks of Sheep, and Goats, on hills that dance,
With much more of this churlish kind:
That quite transported Midas mind,
An held him rapt as in a trance.
3
This wrong the God of Music scorned from such a sottish Judge,
And bent his angry bow at Pan, which made the Piper trudge
Then Midas head he so did trim,
That every age yet talks of him
And Phoebus right revenged grudge.
CANTVS. IX.
^
YOung and simple though I am, I have heard of Cupids name: Guess I can what
^
^
thing it is, Men desire when they do kille. Smoke can never burn they say,
But the
^

flames that follow may.
^
BASSVS.
^
^
2
I am not so foul or fair,
To be proud, nor to desparye;
Guess I can what thing it is
Men desire when they do kiss.
Smoke can never burn they say,
But the flames that follow may.
3
Faith it is but a foolish mind,
Yet me thinks a heat I find,
Like thirst longing that does bide
Ever on my weaker side:
Where they say my heart does move,
Venus grant it be not love.
4
If it he, alas, what then?
Were not women made for men?
A good 'twete a thing were past,
That must needs be done at last.
Roses that are ouer-blowne
Grow less sweet, then fall alone.
5
Yet nor Churl, nor ^^lken Gull
Shall my Maiden blossom pull:
Who shall not I soon can tell,
Who shall would I could as well:
This I know who ere he be
Love he must, or flatter me.
CANTVS. X.
^
Love me or not, love her I must or dye. O that her grace would my wished
Leave me or not, follow her needs must I.
^
^
comforts give. How rich in her, how happy should I live?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
All my desire, all my delight should be
Her to enjoy, her to unite to me:
Envy should cease, her would I love alone,
Who loves by looks, is seldom true to one.
3
Could I enchant, and that it lawful were,
Her would I charm so^tly that none should hear:
But love enforced rarely yields firm content,
So would I love that neither should repent.
CANTVS. XI
^
WHat means this folly now to brave it so, And then to use submission?
^
^
Is that a friend that straight can play the foe? Who loves on such conditi-on?
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Though Briars breed Roses, none the Bryer affect,
But with the flower are pleased:
Love only loves delight, and soft respect,
He must not be diseased.
3
These thorny passions spring from barren breasts,
Or such as need much weeding:
Love only loves delight, and soft respect,
But sends them not home bleeding.
4
Command thy humor, strive to give content,
And shame not loves prof^ssion:
Of kindness never any could repent
That made choice with discretion.
^
Dear if I with guile would guild a true in-tent, Heaping flattries that
^
^
in heart were never me^nt: Easily could I then obtain what now in vain I
force. Fals-hood much does

gain, Truth yet holds the bet-ter course.
^
BASSVS.

^
2
Love forbid that through dissembling I should thrive,
Or in praising you, my self of truth deprive:
Let not your high thoughts debase
A simple truth in me;
Great is beauties grace,
Truth is yet as fair as ^hee.
3
Praise is but the wind of pride if it exceedes,
Wealth pris'd in it self no outward value needs.
Fair you are, and passing fair,
You know it, and it is true,
Yet let none despair
But to find as fair as you.

Pity from every heart is fled,
Aye me, aye me,

Tears of dislembled sorrow,
Constant vows turn truthlesse,
Love cruel, Beauty ruthl^sle.

2
Eyes that of earth are mortal made
What can they view?
All Is but a color or a shade,
And neither always true.
Reasons sight that is eterne,
Even the substance can discern.
3
Soul is the Man; for who will so
The body name?
And to that power all grace we owe
That deckes our lining frame.
What, or how had housen bin,
But for them that dwell therein?
4
Love in the bosom is begot,
Not in the eyes:
No beauty makes the eye more hot,
Her flames the spright surprise:
Let our loving minds then meets,
For pure meetings are most sweet.
CANTVS. XVI.
^
SInce she, even she, for whom I lived, Sweet she by Fate from me is torn,

Why a n not I of sense deprived. Forgetting I was ever borne? Why should I

BASSVS.

2
Be It either true or aptly feigned,
That some of Lethes water write,
It Is their best medicine that are pained,
All thought to loose of past delight.
O would my anguith vanish so!
Happy are they that neither know.
(...)
^
I Must complain, yet do en-ioy my Love, She is too fair, too rich in lovely
parts:
Thence is my grief, for Nature while she strove With all her graces and
di-uinest Arts
^
^
To form her too too beauti-full of hue, She had no leisure left to make her
true.
^
BASSVS.
^
2
Should I agrieu'd then wish thee were less fair?
That were repugnant to mine own desires:
She is admired, new lovers still repair,
That kindles daily loves forgetful fires.
Rest jealous thoughts, and thus resolve at last,
She has more beauty then becomes the chaste.

2
Learn to speak first, then to woo, to wooing much pertayneth:
He that courts us wanting Art, soon falters when he sayneth:
Looks a-squint on his discourse, and smiles when he complains.
3
Skillful Anglers hide their hooks, fit baytes for every season;
But with crooked pins fish thou, as babes do that want reason,
Gogions only can be caught with such poor tricks of treason.
4
Ruth forgive me if I erred from humane hearts compassion,
When I laughed sometimes too much to see thy foolish fashion:
But alas, who less could do that found so good occasion?

HEr fair inflaming eyes, chief authors of my cares,

I prayed in humblest wife, With grace to view my tears: They be-held me broad

BASSVS.

2
Her lips with kisses rich,
And words of fair delight,
I fayrely did beseech
To pity my sad plight:
But a voice from them brake forth
As a whirle-winde from the North.
3
Then to her hands I fled,
That can give heart and all,
To them I long did plead,
And loud for pity call:
But alas they put me off,
With a touch worse then a scoff.
4
So back I straight returned,
And at her breast I knocked;
Where long in vain I mourned,
Her heart so fast was locked;
Not a word could passage find,
For a Rock enclosed her mind.
5
Then down my prayers made way
To those most comely parts,
That make her fly or stay,
As they affect deserts:
But her angry feet thus moved
Fled with all the parts I loved.
6
Yet fled they not so fast
As her enraged mind:
Still did I after haste,
Still was I left behind,
Till I found 'twas to no end
With a Spirit to contend.

TVrne all thy thoughts to eyes, Turn al thy hairs to ears; Change all thy

And all thy loves to fears. True Love will yet be free Inspite of Jealousy.

Turn darkness into day,
Constructures into truth:
Believe what th'enuious say,
Let age interpret youth
True love will yet be free,
Inspite of Jealousy.
3
Wrest euerylword and look,
Rack every hidden thought:
Or fish with golden hook,
True love cannot be caught,
For that will still be free,
In spite of Jealousy.

2
Thanks be to heaven, no grievous smart,
No maladies my limbs annoy:
I bear a sound and sprightfull heart,
Yet live I quite deprived of joy;
Since what I had in vain I crave,
And what I had not now I have.
3
A Love I had so fair, so sweet,
As ever wanton eye did see:
Once by appointment we did meet,
She would, but ah it would not be:
She gave her heart, her hand she gave,
All did I give, she naught could have.
4
What Hagge did then my powers forespeake,
That never yet such taine did feel?
Now she reiects me as one weak,
Yet am I all composed of steel.
Ah this is it my heart does griue,
Now though she sees she will not believe.

Think not when Cupid most you scorn,
Men judge that you of Ice were borne:
For though you cast love at your heel,
His fury yet sometime you feel,
And where-aboues if you would know,
I tell you still not in your toe:
But a little higher, but a little higher;
There, there, o there lies Cupids fire.

Hark the Birds delighted sing,
Yet our pleasure sleeps:
Wealth to none can profit bring,
Which the miler keeps:
O come while we may,
Let Us chain Love with embraces,
We have not all times time to stay,
Not safety in all places.
3
What ill find you now in this;
Or who can complain?
There is nothing done attrisse
That breeds no man pain.
It Is is now flowery May,
But even in cold December,
When all these leaves are blowwne away
This place shall I remember.
