The Testament of master Wylliam Tracie esquier / expounded both by William
Tindall and Iho^ Frith. Wherein thou shall perceive with what charity ye
chaunceler of worcetter Burned when he took up the deed carkas and made ashes
of hit after hit was buried.

M.D.xxxv.

To the reader.
THou shall understand most dear Reader that after Wylliam Tyndall was so^
Iudaslie betrayed by an English man / a scole^ of Louaine / whose name is
Philippes / there were certain things of his doing found: which he had
e^tended to have put forth to the furtheraunce of gods word amongst which
was this Testament of master Tracie expounded by him sealffe / where unto was
annexed / the exposicion of the same of Iho^ Frithes doing and own hand
wrytinge / which I have caused to be put in Printe / to the intent that all the
world should see how ernis^lye the Cannonistes and spiritual lawyers (which
be the chief rul^rs under bysshopes in every dioces in so much that in every
chatedrall church the deane chaunceler and archdeken ar commonly doctoures or
bachelors of law) do endeuer them sealues justly to judge and spirituallye to
give sentence according to charity upon all the acts and deeds done of their
diocessanes / after the ensaumple of the chaunceler of worcetter / which after
master Tracie was buried (of pure zeal and love hardelye) took up the deed
carkas and burnt hit / wherefore he did hit / it shall euidentlye apere to y^
reader in this littell treatise / read hit therefore / I beseech the and judge
the spirits of our spiritualitie / and pray that the spirit of him that
reased up Christ / may ones inhabit them / and mollyfye their hertes / and
so illumine them / that they may both se and show true light / and no longer
to resist God ner his truth / Amen.

The Testament hit sealfe.
In the name of God. Amen.
I Willyam Tracie of Todyngton in y^ cowntie of gloceter esquier / make my
Testament and last will / as here after folowith.

First / and before all other thing I commyt me unto God / and to his mercy /
trustinge with out any dowte or mystrust / that by his grace and the merytes of
Jesus Christ / and by the virtue of his passion / and of his resurrection / I
have and shall have remission of my sins / and resurrection of body and
soul / according as hit is written Job. xix. I believe that my redeamer lives
/ and that in the last day I shall rise owte of the earth / and in my flesh
shall se my savior / this my hope is laid up in my bosom.

And as towching the wealth of my soul / y^ faith that I have taken and
rehearsed / is sufficient (as I suppose) with out any other mannis work / or
workis / My ground and my belefe is / that there is but one god and one
mediator between god and man / which is Jesus christ (...) that I do except
none in heaven nor in earth to be my media^oure between me and god / but only
Jesus Christ / al other be but peticioners in receyui^ge of grace / but none
able to give influence of grace. And therefore will I bestow no part of my
goods for that intent that any man should say / or do / to healp my soul for
therein I trust only to the promise of god / he that believes and is baptized
shall be saved / and he that believes not shall be damned / marcke the last chapter

And towchynge the buryynge of my body / it avails me not what be done
thereto / where in saint Austine de cura agenda pro mortuis says / that they
are rather the solace of them that live than / wealth or cowmforth of them
that are departed / and therefore I remit hit only to the discretion of mine
execu^ours.

And towchinge the distribution of my temporal goods / my purpose is by the
grace of god / to bestow them to be accepted as fruits of faith / So that I do
not suppose that my merit be / by good bestowi^e of them / but my merit is
the faith of Jesus Christ only / by which faith such works are good
according to the words of out lord Math. xxv. I was hongrye / and thou
gave me to eat / and it folowith / that ye have done to the least of my
brethren ye have done to me etc. and ever we should consider the trwe sentence
/ that a good work makes not a good man / but a good man makes a good work
/ for faith makethe the man booth good and rightwyse / for a rightwyse man
lives by faith. Romans i* and what so ever springs not owte of faith / is
sin. Romans xiiij

And all my temporal goods that I have not geuyn / or delivered / or not
given by wrytinge of mine own hand beringe the date of this present writing I
do leave and give To Margarete my wife / and to Richard my son which I make
mine executours / witness this mine own hand / the x. day of October / in
the.xxij. year of the raygne of king Henry the viij.

Tyndall.
Now leat us examen the parts of this Testament sentence by sentence. First to
commyt our selves to God above all / is the first of all preceptis / and the
first stone in the foundation of our faith / that is / that we believe and put
owre trust in one god / one all true / one almighty / all good / and all
merciful / cleauinge fast to his truth / might / mercy / and goodness /
suerly certyfied and full persuaded / that he is our God / ye ours / and to
us all true / without all falsheed and gyle and cannot fail in his promyses /
And to us almyghtye / that his will cannot be lea^ to fulfill all the truth
that he has promised us / And to us all good / and all merciful / what so
ever we have done / and how so ever grievously we have trespassed / so that we
cum to him the way that he has appointed / which way is Jesus Christ only /
as we shall see folowingly this first clause than / is the first commawndement
/ or at at the least / the first sentence in the first commawndement / and the
first article of our creed.

And that this trust and confidence in the mercy of God is through Jesus Christ
/ is the second article of our creed confirmed and testified through out all
scripture / That Christ brings us in to this grace / Paul proves. Romans v.
saying. Justified by faith we are ^t peace with God / through Jesus Christ our
Lord / By whom we have an entering in unto this grace in which we stand / and
Ephe. iij. By whom says Paul we have a boold entringe in / through ye faith
that is in him* and in the second of the said Epistle / By him we have an
entering in unto the father / and a little before in the same chapter / he is
our peace. And Ihon in the first chapter. Behold the Lamb of God which
takethe away the sin of the world / which sin was the busshe that
stopped the entering in / and keapt us out / and the sword wherewith was kept
the entering unto the tree of ly^^ from Adam and all his ofsprynge.

And in the second of the first of Peter / which bare our sins in his Body
/ and by whose stripes we are made hole. By whom we have redempcio^ through his
blood even the forgeuenes of our sins Colloss. i. and Ephesians. i. And Romans
iiij. He was delivered for our sins and rose again for our iustifyenge.

And concerning the resurrection / it is an article of our faith / and proved
there sufficientlye / and that hit shall be by the power of Christ / is also the
open scripture.

Ihon. vi. This is the will of my father which sent me / that I lose nothing of
all that he has given me / but that I raise hit up again in the last day /
and again I am the resurrec^ion Ihon. xi.

That this live faith is sufficient to justification with owte adding to of
any more help / is this wise proved the promyser is God of whom Paul faith.
Roma. viij. If God be on our side what matter makes hit who be against us /
he is thereto all good / all merciful / all true / and all mighty / wherefore
sufficient to be believed by his oath / more over Christ in whom the promise is
made has received all power in heaven and in earth. Mat. the last.

He has also a perpetual presthode / and therefore able perpetually to save.
Heb. vij

And that there is but one mediator Christ is Paul i. ad Timoth. ij. And by
that word understand an attonemaker / a peace maker and brynger in to grace
and favor / having full power so to do. And that Christ is so / is proved at
the full. Hit is written Ihon iij. The Father loves the son / and has given
all in to his hand.

And he that believes the son has everlasting life and he that believes not
the son shall not see life / but the wrath of God bydeth upon him. All
things ar given me of my father. Luke. x. And all who so ever call on the name
of the Lord shall be saved. Acts. ij. Of his fulness have we all received Ihon.
j. There is no another man given to man in which we must be saved. Acts. iiij.
And again / unto his name bear all the prophets record / that by his name
shall all that believe in him receive remission. Acts. x. In him dwells all
the fulness of god bodily. Colloss. ij. All what soever my father has are mine.
Ihon. xvj. Whatsoever ye axe in my name that will I do for you Ihon. xiiij. One
Lord / one faith / one baptyme / one God and father of all / which is above
all / through all and in you all Ephesians. iiij. There is but one whose servant I am
/ to do his will. But one that shall pay me my wages / there is but one to whom
I am bound / ergo but one that has power over me to damn or save me / I will
add to this Paul's Argument Galat. iij. God swear unto Abraham.cccc. year
before the law was given / that we should be saved by Christ. Ergo the law
given.cccc. years after can not dysanull that covenant / So dispute I Christ
when he had soffered his passion / and was risen again and entered in to his
glory / was sufficient for his apostles / without any other mean or help /
ergo the holiness of no saint sense has dimynisshed owght of that his power
But that he is as full sufficient now / for the promise is as deaply made to us
as them / Moreover the treasure of his mercy was laid up in Christ for all
that should believe / yer the world was made / ergo nothing that has happened
sense has chawnged the purpose of the in unvariable god.

Moreover to exclude the blind imagination falslye called faith / of them that
give them sealues to vice with out resistance / affirminge / that they have no
power to do otherwise / but that God has so made them / and therefore must save
them / they not entendinge or purposynge to mende their living / but synnynge
with hole consent and full lust / he declares what faith he means.ij. manner
of wayse / First by that he says / who so ever believes and is baptized /
shall be saved / By which wordis he declares euydently / that he meanith that
faith / that is in the promise made apo^ the apoyntment between god and us /
that we should keape his law to the uttermost of our power / that is he that
believes in Christ for the remission of sin / and is baptized to do the will
of Christ / and to keep his law / of love / and to mortify the flesh / that
man shall be saved / and so is the imaginacion of thise swyne that wylnot leave
wallowynge thez sealues in every mire and podell / clean excluded / for God
never made promise but upon an appointment or covenant under which who so ever
will not come can be no partaker of the promise / True faith in Christ / gives
power to love the law of god: for it is written Iho^ the first / he gave them
power to be the sons of god in that they believe in his name / Now to be y^
son of God / is to love rightwisnes / and hate vnrightwisnes and so to be
like thy father. Have thou than no power to love the law so have thou no faith
in Christis blood. And Romans iij. we set up or maynteyne the law through faith
/ why so* for the preaching of faith ministers the spirit. Galat. iij.
and.ij. Corinth. iij. and the spirit loweseth the bands of Satan / and
geuethe power to love the law / and also to do hit.

For says Paul Romans viij. if the spirit of hi^ that reased up Jesus dwell in
you / then will he that reased up Jesus quycken your mortal bodies by the
means of his spirit dwellinge in you.

A well will thou say: if I must profess the law and work / ergo faith
alone saves me not. Be not deceived with sophistry: but withdraw thine ears
from words and consider the thing in thine heart. Faith justifies the: that
is brings remission of all sins / and seattethe the in the state of grace
before all works / and gets the power to work yer thou coudest work /
but if thou wilt not go back again / but continewe in grace / and come to
that salvation and gloriouse resurrection of Christ / thou must work and
join woorkis to thy faith in will / and deed to / if thou have time and
leisure / and as often as thou fallest set the on thy faith again withowt he
^lpe of works. And all thowghe when thou art reconcyled and restored to grace
works be required yet is not that reconsilynge and grace the benefit of the
works that follow: but clean contrary that forgeuenes of thy sins and
restoringe to favor deserve the works that follow. Thowgh when the king (after
that sentence of deeth is given upon a murtherar) has pardoned him / at the
request of some of his friends / works be required of him that he henceforth
keep the kings laws / if he will continewe in his graces favor / in which he
now stands / yet y^ benefyte of his life proceeds not of the deserving of
the works that follow / but of the kings goodness / and favor of his
friends / ye and that benyfyte and gift of his life deserve the works that
follow Thowghe the father chastise the child / yet is y^ child no less bownd
to obey / and to do the will of the father. If when the father pardons hit /
the works that follow deserve that favor / than must the works that
followed the correction have deserved favor also. And than was the father
vnrightwyse to chastise hit. All whatsoever thou art able to do / to please God
with all / is thy duty to do / thowghe thou had never sinned / if hit be
thy duty how (...) it than be the deserving of ye mercy and grace that went
before? Now that mercy / was the benefit of god thy father through the
deserving of the lord Christ / which has bowght the with y^ price of his
blood.

And again when he says that he purposes to bestow his good / to be accepted
as fruits of faith / hit is evident that he meanith that lyuinge faith wc
professes y^ law of god / and is y^ mother of all good woorkis / ye ^ nursse
thereto.

A another cauillation which they might make in the second part / where he
admits no another mediator but Crist only / nor will give of his goods /
to bynd any man to any feigned observance for ye healp of his soul / when he
were hole in the kingdom of Christ clean delivered both body and soul from
the dominion of Satan (as the scripture testifies all that die in Christ to
be) is this / they will say / that he held that none should pray for him
save Christ / and that we be not bound to pray one for another / ner ought to
desire the prayers of another man* that he excludes / in that he says all
other be but peticioners. By wc words he plainly confesses that other may
and ought for to pray / and that we may and ought to desire other to pray
for us: but meanith that we may not put our trust and confidence in their
prayer / as though y^ gave of them selves that which they desire for us in
their peticions / and so give them the thanks / and ascribe to their merits
that wc is given us in the name of our master Christ / at the deseruinges of
his blood Christ is my lord / and has deserved and also obt^yned power / to
give me all that can be desired for me. And all that other desire for me: that
is desired in Christ's name and given at the merytes of his blood. All the
honor than / trust / confidence / and thanckis / perteyne to him also. Some
will haplye say / how should I desire another to pray for me / and not trust
to his prayer. Verily even as I desire my neghbur to help me at my need / and
yet trust not to him. Christ has commanded us to love each other. Now when I
go to desire healp / I put my trust in god / and complain to god first / and
say / Loo father / I go to my brother / to axe help in thy name / prepare the
heart of him agenst I come: that he may pytye me and help me for thy sake etc.
Now if my brother remember his duty and help me / I received hit of god / and
give god the thanks which moved the heart of my brother and gave my brother a
courage to help me and wherewith to do hit / and so has help me by my brother.
And I love my brother again and say: Loo father I went to my brother in thy
name / and he has help me for thy sake: wherefore O father be thou as
merciful to him at his need / as he has been to me for thy sake / at my need.
Lo now as my brother did his duty when he help me / so do I my duty when I
pray for him again: and as I might not have put my trust and confidence in my
brothers help / so may he not in my prayers. I am sure that god will healp me
by his promise / but am not suer that my brother will help me / thowghe hit be
his duty / so am I sure that god will hear me whatsoever I axe in Christ's
name by his promise / but am not suer that my brothere will pray for me / or
that he has a good heart to god

No / But the saynctes in heaven can not but pray and be herd / no more can
the saints in earth / but pray and be heard nether. Moses / Samuel / David
/ Noye / Elias / Elizeus / Esaias / Daniel / and all the Prophets prayed and
were heard: yet was none of those wicked that would not put there trust in God
/ according to their doctrine and preaching partaker of their prayers in the
end. And as damnable as hit is for the pore to trust in the riches of the
rychest upon earth / so damnable is yt alto to leave y^ covenant made in
Christ's blood / and to trust in the saynct of heaven. They that be in heaven
know the elect that trust in chrystis blowde and profess the law of god and
for them only pray: and these wicked Idolatrers which have no trust in the
covenant of god / ner serve god in the spirit ner in the gospel of christ's
blood / but after their blind Imaginacion / choosing the^ every man a sondrie
saint to be their mediator / to trust to and to be saved by their merits /
do the saynctes abhore and defye. And their prayers and offeringes / ar to the
saynctes as acceptable and pleasunt / as was the prayer and ye offeringe of
Simon Magus to Peter. Act. viij.

More over the saints in their most combraunce ar most conforted and most
able to confort other / as Paul testifies.i. corinth. i. In so much that
Saint Steven and Saint James prayed for them that slew them / Saint Martine
preached and counforted his desperaet brethren even unto the last breath / and
likewise (as stories make mention) did innumerable more. Ye and I have known of
simple unlearned persons and that of some that were great sinners wc at the
hour of deeth have fallen flat of the blood of Christ / and given no rowme to
other men's either prayers or preachinges: but have as stronglye trusted in in
Christ's blood / as ever did Peter or Paul / and have thereto preached hit to
other / and exhorted other so myghtelye that an angel of heaven could not mende
them. Who then should resist God that he might not give the same grace to master
Tracie / which was a learned man / and better seen in the works of Saint
Austine. xx. year before he dyed / than ever I knew doctoure in England / but
that he must than faint and shryncke / when most neade is to be strong / and
fear the popes purgatory and trust to the prayer of Pristes derely paid for*
I dar say that he prayed for ye pristes when he dyed / that god would convert a
great meny of them / and if he had known of any good man among them that had
neded / he would have given / and if he had known of any lack of Pristes / he
would have given to mayntene moo: But now sense there be more then I now / and
have more then every man a sufficient living / how should he have given them
but to hyre their prayers of pure mystrust in Christ's blood? if robbinge of
wydowes howses under preten^e of long prayers be damnable. Matthe. xxiij. Then
is it damnable also for wydows to suffer them selves to be robbed by the long
patterynge of hypocrites / through mystrust in Christ's blood: ye and is it not
damnable to mayntene soch abhominacion? Now when this damnation is spread over
al / how ca^ we give them that have enough alredye / or how can ^^ey th^^
(...) ynowghe alredye to ^e mo^^e under (...) name of prayenge / and not harden
the people moare in this damnable damnacion?

And concerning the burienge of his body he allegeth saint Austen / nether is
there any man (think I) so mad to affirm that the outward pomp of the body
should healp the soul. More over what greatter sign of infidelytie is there /
then to care at the time of death / with what pomp the carkas shall be carried to
the grave. He denies not but that a Christen man should be honorably buried
namely for the honor and hope of the resurrection / and therefore co^mmytted
that care to his dear executours his son ^ his wife / which he wist woolde
in that part do sufficient / and leave nothing of the use of the contre ^ndone
/ but the abuse

And that bestowenge of a great part of his gods (while he yet lived upon
the pore / to be thanckfull for the mercy receued / without byynge and
selling with God / that is / without byndinge those p^^e unto any other
appointed prayers than god has bownde us already / one to pray for a another /
one to help a another / as he has helped us / but patiently ^^bydinge for the
blessings that God has appointed unto all manner good works / trustinge
faithfully to his promise / thankinge (as ye may se by his words) the blood
of Christ for the reward promised to his woorkis and not the goodness of the
woorkis as thowhh he had done mo^re then his duty / or all that: And assygned
by wrytinge unto whom a another part should be distributed / and geuinge the
rest to his executours / that no strife should be / which executours were by
right the heirs of all that was left to them: Thise things I say are signs
evident not only of a good Christen man / but alsoo of a perfect Christen man
/ and of such a one as neded not to be ^gast and desperaet for fear of the
paynfull pains of purgatory / which who so fearith as they feign hit cannot
but utterly abhor deeth: seeing that Crist is there no longer thy Lord /
after he has browght the thither / but art excluded from his satisfaction /
and must satisfye for thy self alone / and that with sufferinge pain only /
or else taryenge the satisfienge of them that shall never satisfy ynought for
them selves / or gapinge for the Popes pardons / which have so great dowtes
and dangers / what in the mind ^ intent of the graunter / and what in the
purchesar / yet they can be treuly ob^eyned with all due circumstances / and
much le^ certitude that they have any authority at all. Paul thristed to be
dissolved and to ^e with Christ: Steven desired Christ to take his spirit /
the prophets also desired god to take their souls from them / and all the
saynctes went with a lustye courage to deeth / nether fearing or teachinge us
to fear any such crudelitie. Where has the church then gotten authority to
bind us from being so perfect / from having any such faith in the goodness
of God our Father / and Lord Christ / and to make such per^yt^es and faith
of all heresies the greatest*

Solomon says in the.xxx. of his Prouer^es / iij. (...) insatiable and the
fourth s^^th never / It is enough. But there is a fyft called d^^^e avarice /
with as greadye a (...) / as meltynge a mawe / as wide a throat / as gapynge a
mouth / and with as ^^^ening teeth as the best / which the moare she eats the
ho^gryer she is. An unquiet evil never at rest / a blind monstre and a
surmysynge be / fearing at the fall of every leaf. Quid non mortalia
p^ciora cogis / auri sacra fames? What does not that holy honger compel them
that love this world inordinatly / to commit? might that deuyls belie be
once full / truth should have audience / and words he construed a right / and
taken in the same sense as they be meant.

Thowgh hit seem not impossible haplye that there might be a place / where the
souls might be kept for a space / to be taught and instruct: yet that there
should be such a Iayle as they Iangle / and soch facyons as they feign / is
plain impossible and repugnaunt to the scripture: for when a man is translated
utterly out of the kingdom of Satan / and so confyrmed in grace that he can
not sin / so burning in love that his lust cannot be plucked from gods
will / and being partaker with us of all the promyses of God and under the
commandments: what could be deuyed him in that deep innocence of his most
kind father / that has leaft no mercy vnpromysed / and a^inge hit thereto in
the name of his son Jesus / the child of his hertys lust / which is our
lord and has left no mercy undeserved for us* namely when god has sworn
that he will put of rightwisnes / and be to us a father / and that of all
mercy / and has slain ^hys most dear son Jesus / to confyr^^ (...) oath.

Finally seeing that Christ's love takethe all to the best / and nothing i^
here that may not be well understood / (the circumstances declaringe in what
sense all was meant) they ought to have interpreted her charitably / if ought
had been found dowtefull or semynge to sound a mysse. Moreover if any thing
had been therein that could not have be taken well / yet their party had been
to have interpret i^ as spoken of ydelnes of the heed / by the reason off
syckenesse / for as much as the man was vertuous^ wise / and well lernyd / and
of good fame / and report / and found in the faith while he was a live. but
if they say he was suspect when he was a live / then is their doing so much
the woorsse / and to be thowght that they feared his doctrine when he was a a
live / and mystrusted their own part / their consciences testifyenge to them
that he held no another doctrine then that was true / seeing they then neither
spoke nerwrote against him / ner brought him to any examinac^on. Beside that
some merry fellows will think / that they owght first to have sent to him to
wytt whether he would have revoked / yer they had so dispytefully burnt the deed
body / that could not answer for it sealffe / nor interpret ^his woordys /
how he meant them / namely the man being of so worshipful and ancient a
blood. But here will I make an end desyringe the ^eader to look on this
thing with indifferent eyys / and judge whether I have expounded ye words of
this Testament as they should seame to sygnyfye / or not / Judge also whether the
maker thereof seame not by his work both vertuou^ and godly* wc if it so be /
think not that he was y^ worsse because the deed body was burnt to ashes /
but rather learn to know the great desire that hypocryses have to find one
craft or other to d^^e ^ truth with / and cause hit to be counted for heresye of
the simple and unlearned people which are so ignorant that they cannot spy
their sotteltye / hit must neades be heresy that towcheth any thing their
ra^^en byle they will have hit so who so ever say nay only the eternal god
must be prayed to night and day to amend them in whose power it only lies.
Who also grant them ones ernestlye to thriste his true doctrine contained in
the sweet and pure fountaynes of his scriptures and in his paths to direct
their wayys, Amen

Here ends the Exposicion of Wyllyam Tyndall. And follows Ihon Frithes.
Ihon Frith
There is nothing in this world tha^ is so ferme / stable or Godly / but that
it may be vndermynede / and f^owardlye wrested of men / and spe^yally if they
be void of cherite As it is euydent by Wyllyam Tracyes Testament and last will
that he left / ageynste the which many men / and that of long Contynewaunce
have blasphemously barked. whetther of a godly zele / or of a dasynge brain /
let other men judge. But this I dare boldly profess / that his godly sayings
are ungodly handled / which thing I cannot so iustlye ascribe unto ignorance
/ as unto rancor / unto y^ furyes I had amost^ said / for if they had conferred
all things unto the ru^e of charity / which enuyeth not / which is not puffed
up / which is not stur^ed to vengeance / which thinks none evil: but
sufferith all things / believes all things / trustith all things / and
bearith all things / they would not so hedelye have condemned those things /
which might have been full devoutly expounded / how be it they have not only
atteptyd that thing / but have procedyd unto such madness / that they have
taken upon the to strive with dead folks / for it is a most comen jest in every
man's mouth that after the maker of this Testament was departed / and buried /
they took up his body and burnt it which thing declared their furye
although he felt no fire / Therefore we humblye requere ow^e most redowted
prince / with all his noble^ / and present assembly / that even as al other
things do of right depend of their judgment / that even so they would by
their discrete advise / cure this disease / p^deringe all things with a more
equal ballaunce / So shall this enormous fact be looked upon with worthy
correction / and the condition of the commonwealth shall be more ^^yet / mark you
therefore what things they are / which they so cruellye condemn.

Master Tracie.
In the name of God. Amen.
I Willyam Tracie of Todyngton in ye cowntie of gloceter esquier / make my
Testament and last will / as here after folowith.

First / and before al other things I commyt me unto God / and to his mercy /
trustinge with out any dowte or mystrust / that by his grace and the merytes of
Jesus Christ / and by the virtue of his passion / and of his resurrection / I
have and shall have remission of my sins / and resurrection of body and soul
/ according as hit is written Job. xix. I believe that my redeamer lives / and
that ^n the last day I shall rise owte of the earth / and in my flesh shall se
my savior / this my hope is laid up in my bosom.

Frith
IT is meruell but here be sumwhat that they improve / for their mind is so
intoxicate that there is nothing but they will note it with a black cole /
and yet all may be establysshed by the testymonye of scripture / for faith is
the suer persuasion of our mind of god and his goodness toward us / And where
as is a suer persuasion of the mind / there can be no doutinge or mystruste /
for he that douteth is like the floude of the sea which is tossed with wyndes
and karried with violence / and let not that man think that he shall obtain
any thing of God Ia. i. And therefore / saint Austyne says / if I doubt I
shall be no holy seed / furthermore where as he looks through the grace and
merytes of Christ to obtain remission of his sins / suerly it is a
faithful saying / and worthy to be commendyd / for it is even ye same that
Peter professed Act. xv. where he says / unto him do all the prophets bear
witness / that through his name as many as believe in him shall receive
remission of their sins / morouer in that he trustith through Christ to have
resurrection of body and soul they have no cause to blame him / for thus doyth
paul argue / if Christ be risen / then shall we also rise and if Christ be
not risen / then shall not we rise / but Christ is risen / for his soul was
not left in hell / therefore shall we also rise (whom Christ shall bring with
him) and be immortalle / both body and soul i. Cor. xv. And therefore he does
both rightwislye and godly deduce his resurrection by christ's / by whom the
Father has given us all things / or else we should not be / But there are some
/ that gather of his words / that he should recounte the soul to be mortal
which thing after my judgment is more suttellye gathered then either truly
or charitablye / for seeing there was never Christen man that ever so thought
(no not the very pagaynes / what godly zele / or brotherlye love was there
which caused them so to surmyse / for a good man would not once dream such a
thing: but I pray you why should we not say that the soul does verelye rise
which through Christ risinge from ye fylthe of sin / does enter with the
body into a new conversation of life / which they shall lead to gether with
out possibilite of synninge / we say also of god (by a certain phrase of
scripture) that he arisethe / when he openythe unto us his power / and
presence: And why may we not say the same thing of the soul which in the
mean ceasone seems to lie secret / and then shall express unto us (through
Christ) her power and presence / in taking again her natural body / why
should ye then condemn these things / There is no man that can receive venom
by those words / except he have such a spiderowse nature that he can turn
an honye comb into perelous poison. Therefore let us look on the resydewe.

Master Tracie
And as towching the wealth of my soul / ye faith that I have taken and
rehearsed / is sufficient (as I suppose) with out any other mannis work / or
workis /

Frith
Here he only cleauith to god / and his mercy / being suerly persuaded that
according to the testimonye of Peter / who so ever beleuyth in him / through
his name shall receive remission of sins. Act. xv. Paul also affirms /
that who so ever trusts in hi^ shall not be confounded. Roma. x. And who can
deny but this is most true / when it is understand off that faith which is
formed with hope and charity / with the Apostle calls faith / that works by
cherite. Galatas.v. Now sithe these things may be expounded so puerlye /
forsoothe he utters his own envy which would otherwise wreste the mind of
ye maker of this Testament

And as towching the addition of this particle with out any other man's work /
or works: yt semith that he had respect unto the saying of Peter / wc
declares that there is no another name under heaven given unto men / in wc we
should be sauyd. Act. iiij. Besides that S. Paul commits ye power of
sanctifieng to Christ only. Hebr. ij. where he says / both he that sanctifies
(that is to say Christ) and they that are sanctified (that is to say the
faithful) are all of one (that is God) and suerlye if we labored to precell
each other in love and Cherite / we should not condemn this Innocente / But
we should rather mesure his words by the rule off Cherite / in so much that
if a thing at the first syghte did apeare wicked / yet should we take it in
the best sense / not Iudginge wickedly of our brother / but referringe that
secret judgment unto Christ which cannot be disceyued / and though they be
disceyued by the pretense of Cherite / yet therein they may rejoice / and
therefore they would be loathe to condemn ye innocent / but let us pass these
things / and se what folowith.

Master Tracie
My ground and my belefe is / that there is but one god and one mediator
between god and man / which is Jesus christ so that I accept none in heauyn nor
in earth to be mediator between god and me / but only Jesus Christ / all
other to be petycioners in receyui^ge grace but none able to give influence of
grace / and therefore I will bestow no part of my goods for that intent that
any man should say or do to help my soul / for therein I trust only to the
promise of Christ / he that believes and is baptized shall be saved / and he
that believes not shall be damned.

Frith.
Why look you so sowerlye good brotherne^ why do you not rather give him great
thanckes? sithe he has openned unto you such a proper distinction by the
which you may escape the scolasticalle shares and mases / he only deserves
the name of a middeler / which being God became man to make men gods / And who
can by right be called a middeler between God and man but he that is both god
and man / therefore sithe we have such a myddeler / which in all points has
prouyd owre infirmytye (sayuinge only in sin) which is exalted above the
heuyns / and syttethe on the right hand of God / and has in all things
obtained the next pour unto him / of whose imperye all things depend / let
us come with suer confidence unto the trone of grace. Hebr. iiij. All other he
callyth peticioners which receive grace / but are not able to empress and
power thereof into any other man / for that does only God distribute with his
finger (that is to say / the spirit of god) through christ / I meruell that
you are angrye with him that has done you such a great pleasure / how be it
I do Ascribe this condemnacio^ rather unto the canonystes then unto deuynes /
For the godly deuynes would never dote so fare as to co^dempne so proper
sayings / but paraduenture this might move their pacyence / that he will
distribute no porcyon of his goods / for that intent that any man should say
or do for the weal of his soul / ar you so sore afraid of yower market? Be
not afraid / ye have salues ynowghe to souple that sore / ye know that he is
not bownde under pain of dampnation to distribute his goodis on that facion /
for the^ those holy fathers were in shrewde case which contynewinge in long
penurye / skant left at their departinge a half penye. Thou will
paraduenture say / that they shall suffer the grievous pains off purgatory /
be it so / yet may they be quenshid both with less cost and labor / the
popes pardone is ready at hand / where both the crime and the pain are
remytted attonce / and verily there is such plentye of them in all places /
that I can scantly believe that there lives any man that is worth an half penny
but that he is suer of some pardons in store / And as for this man he had
innumerable. Notwithstanding this distribucion is not of necessite (for unto
him that is dampened it profettyth nothing / And he that is not dampened is suer
of salvation) why are ye so hot against this man / are not his goods in his
own power / he shall give a reckeninge of them unto god / and not unto you /
here you may se / of how light judgment you have condempnyd these things /
now let us ponder the residwe.

Master Tracie.
And towchinge the buryenge off my body / hit auaylethe me not what be done
thereto / wherein. S. Austyne in the book de cura agenda pro mortuis / enformynge
us says / that they are rather the solace of the^ that live / tha^ wealth or
coumforth of the^ that are departed and therefore I remyt it only to the
discretion of mine executoures.

Frith.
What has he here offendyd which rehersyth nothing but the words of S.
Austyne / if you improve these things than reprove you S. Austyne him self /
Now if you can find the means to allow. S. Austyne and cheritablye to
expownde his words / why do you not admit the same fa^^ure unto yower
brother / specyallye seeing cherite / requerithe it: besides that / no man can
deny / but that these things are true / although S. Austynes auctorit^ were
of no reputacyon with you / for if these things were of so great value before
God / then Christ had evil provided for his martyrs whose bodies are commonly
cast owte to be consumed with fire / and wild beasts / notwithstondinge I
would be afraid to say that they were any thing the worse for the burning
of their bodies or t^^^ynge of it in pieces / Be therefore charitable toward
yower brother and ponder his words (which are rather saynt^ Austynnes) some
what more iustlye

Master Tracie
As towchinge the distribution of my temporal goods / my purpose is by the
grace of god to bestow them / to be accepted as fruits of faith. So that I do
not suppose that my merit shall be by the good bestowinge of them / but my
merit is the faith of Jesus Christ only wherbye such works be good. Matthew.
xxv. I was hongrye and thou gave me to eat / and it follows / that ye have
done to the leest of my brethren ye have done to me etc^. And ever we should
consider the true sentence / a good work makes not a good man / but a good
man makethe a good work / for faith makes the man Both good and right wise /
for a rightwyse man lives by faith. Romans i. And whatsoever springs not out
of faith is sin. Romans xiiij

And all my temporal goods that I have not given and delivered / or not given
by wrytinge of my own hand / berynge the date of this present writing / I do
leave / and give to Margarete my wife and to Richard my son / which I make
mine executours: wytnes this mine own hand / the.x. day of October / in
the.xxij. year of the raygne of king Henry the.viij.

Frith.
THere is no man doutyth but that faith is the root of the tree / and the
quyckenynge power out of which all good fruits spring therefore it is
necessary that this faith be present or else we should look for good works in
vain: for without faith it is impossible to please god. Heb. xj. in so much
that S. Austyn called those works that are done before faith / swiffte
runnynge out of the way. Morouer that owr merit cannot properlye be asscrybed
unto owr works does the Euangeliste teache us saying / when ye have done all
things that are commanded you / say we are unprofitable seruauntis / we have
done but owr deutye. Luke.xvij. By the which sayynge he does in a manner fear
us from puttyng any confydence in our own works: And so is owr glorious
pride / and hye mind excluded. Then where is owr merit ^harke what S. Austyne
says: The death of the Lord is my merit: I am not with out merit as long
as that merciful Lord faylith me not etc^. This death of the lord cannot
proffite me / except I receive it through faith / and therefore he reckenyth
right well that the faith in Christ is all his meryt / I mean the faith which
works through cherite / that is to say faith / formed with hope and cherite
/ and not that dead historical faith which the deuyls have and tremble. Iaco.
ii. Furthermore what what S. Austyne judges of our merit he expressith in
these words: mark the Psalm / how the proud head will not receive the
croune / when he says he that redeemed thy lyffe from corruption: which
crounythe the (says the Psalm) here upon would a man say / which crouneth
the / my merits grant that / my virtue has done it / I have deseruyd it /
ye is not frelye given / but give kare rather to the pleasure / for that is but
thine own saying / and every Man is a liar / but hear what God says / which
crounyth the in compassion and mercy / of mercy he crounith the / of
compassion he crounyth the / for thou wast not worthy that he should call the
/ and whom he should iustyfye when he called the / And whom he should glorifye
when he justifies the: For the remanauntes are sauyd by the election which is
by grace ^ favor. Romans xi. Now if hit be by grace then is hit not of works /
for then grace were no grace. Romans iiij. For unto him that workethe is the
reward imputed not of grace but of deutye. Romans iiij. the Apostle says / not
of grace but of deutye / but he crounyth the in compassion and mercy / and if
thy merits have proceeded / god says unto the / boulte out thy good merits
and thou shall find that they are my gifts / this is the righteousness of God
/ not meanyng^ the righteousness wherbye he him self is rightwise but the
righteousness wherewith he iustifyethe them whom he makithe rightwyse where before
they were wicked / these are Austynes words.

Fynallye let not that move you where he addyth / that a good work makes
not a good man / but rather a good man makethe the work good / for there is no
man but he is either good or evil / If he be evil then can he not do good but
evil / for according to Christ's testimonye / a rootten tree bearithe no good
fruit. Matthew. vij. And again he says / how ca^ you say well seeing you your
selves are evil. Mat. xij. But if he be good / he shall also bring forth good
fruit at his ceasone / how be it that fruit makethe not the man good / for
except the man be first good he can not bring forth good fruit / but the tree
is known by the fruit / And therefore faith as a quyckenynge root must ever go
before / which of wicked makes us rightwyse and good / which thing our
works could never bring to pass / out of this fou^tayne spring those good
works which iustifye us before men / that is to say / declare us to be very
rightwyse / for before God we are verily justified by that root of faith / for
he serchithe the heart and therefore this just judge does inwardely iustyfye or
condemn / gyuinge sentence according to faith / but men must look for the
works / for their sight ca^ not enter into the heart / and therefore they
first give judgment of works / and are many times deceived under the cloak of
hypocrisy

You may se that here is nothing / but that a good man may expou^de it well
al be it ye childerne of this world (wc with their wiles deceive the^ selves
enteringe so presumptuously into Gods judgment) do seek a doubt where none is
/ Go ye therefore and let charity be yower guide / for god is cherite / and
thowgh our laweyers heart would break / yet must you needs judge hi^ a christian
man / wc says nothing but that scripture confyrmythe / And verily the
judgment of this cause came owte of ceasons and even vngracyouslye unto our
Canonistes / for they are clean ignorant off scripture and therefore condemn
all things that they read not in their law / wherefore we renounce their
sentence and appeal unto the deuynes / which will sone know the voice of
their sheepherde and gladlye admit those things which are allowed by the
scripture whereunto they are accustomed.

Thus endethe the Testament of M. Vvillia^ Tracie expounded by I. frith.
