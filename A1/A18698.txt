A caroll of hunting.
As I came by a grene forest side
I met with a forster yt badde me abide
whey go bet / hey go bet / hey go* how
we shall have sport and game ynowe.
Underneath a tree I did me set
And with a great heart anon I met
I badde let styppe / and said hey go bet
With bey go bet / hey go (...)
we shall have sport and game ynowe*
I had not stand there but a while
Not the mountenaunce of a mile
There came a great heart without gyle
There he gothe / there he gothe. etc.
we shall have sport and game ynowe.
Talbot my hou^de with a merry taste
All about the grene wode he began cast
I took my horn and blewe him a blast
with tro / to / to / to: tro / to / to / to.
with hey go bet / hey go bet. etc.
There he gothe / there he goth. etc.
we shall have sport and game ynowe.
Finis.
A caroll bringyng in the bores heed.
Caput apri differo
Reddens laudens domino.
The bores heed in hand bring I
With garlans gay and rosemary
I pray you all sing merely
Qui estis in conuiuio.
The bores heed I understand
Is the thief service in this land
Look where ever it be fande
Seruite cum cantico.
Be glad lords both more and less
For this has ordained our steward
To chere you all this christmasse
The bores heed with mustarde.
Finis.
Thus ends the Christmasse carolles / newely enprinted at London / in the
fletestrete at the sign of the son by wynkynde word. The year of our lord.
