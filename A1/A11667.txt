Information from the Scottish Nation, to all the true English, concerning the
present Expedition.
OUR distresses in our Religion and Liberties being of late more pressing then
we were able to bear; our Supplications and Commissions, which were the
remedies used by us for our relief, were after many delays and repulses,
answered at last with the terrors of an Army coming to our borders; A peace
was concluded, but not observed: And when we did complain of the breach, and
supplicat for the performance, our Commissioners were hardly entreated; new and
great preparations were made for war; and many acts of hostility done against
us, both by Sea and land. In this case to send new Commissioners or
supplications, were against experience, and hopeless; To maintain an Army on
the borders is above our strength, and cannot be a safety unto us by Sea: To
retire homeward, were to call on our Enemies to follow us, and to make our
selves and our Country, a prey by land, as our Ships and goods are made at
Sea. We are therefore constrained at this time to come into England, not to
make war, but for seeking our relief and preservation.

Duty obliges us to love England as our selves: Your grievances are ours;
The preservation or ruin of Religion and Liberties, is common to both Nations:
We must now stand or fall together. Suffer not therefore malice and calumny to
prevail so far as to persuade, that we come to make war, We call Heaven and
Earth to witness, that we are far from such intentions, and that we have no
purpose to fight, except we be forced, and in our own defense (as we have more
fully expressed in our large Declaration) we come to get assurance of the
enjoying of our Religion and Liberties in peace against invasion: and that the
authors of all our grievances and yours being tried in Parliament, and our
wrongs redressed, the two Kingdoms may live in greater love and unity then
ever before, which to our common rejoicing, we may confidently expect from the
goodness of God, if the wicked counsels of Papists, Prelates and other
firebrarnds their adherents be not more harkned unto, then our true and honest
Declarations.

And where it may be conceived, that an Army cannot come into England but they
will waste and spoil; We declare, that no Soldiers shall be allowed to
commit any outrage, or do the smallest wrong, but shall be punished with
severity: That we shall take neither meat nor drink, nor any thing else, but for
our moneys: and when our moneys are spent, for sufficient surety, which by
public order shall be given to all such as shall furnish us things necessary.
We neither have spared, nor will we spare our pains, fortunes, and lyves in
this cause of our assurance and your deliverance: and therefore cannot look
from any well-affected to truth and peace, to be either opposed by force and
unjust violence in our peaceable passage, or to be discouraged by wilful or
uncharitable withholding of means for our sustentation on our way. We are
brethren: Your worthy Predecessors at the time of Reformation, vouchsafed us
their help and assistance. We have for many years lived in love: we have
common desires of the purity of Religion and quietness of both Kingdoms: our
hopes are to see better days in this Island: our Enemies also are common: Let
us not upon their suggestions or our own apprehensions, be friends to them, and
enemies to our selves: We desire nothing but what in the like extremity (which
we pray God your Nation never find) we would most gladly upon the like
Declaration grant unto you, coming with your Supplications to the Kings
Majesty, were he living amongst us: and what ye would we should do unto you,
we trust ye will be moved to do even so unto us, that the blessing of GOD may
rest upon both.
