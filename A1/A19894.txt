ANE BRIEF COMMENDATIOVN OF VPRICHTnes, in respect of the surenes of the same,
to all that walk in it, amplify it chiefly be that notabill document of Goddis
michtie protectioun, in preserving his may vpricht seruand, and fervent
Messinger of Christis Euangell, Iohne Knox. Set forth in Inglis meter be M.
Iohne Dauidsone, Regent in S. Leonards College.

Quhairunto is addit in the end ane schort discurs of the Estaitis quha hes
cause to deploir the deith of this Excellent seruand of God.

PSALM. XXXVII.

Mark the vpricht man, and behauld the Just, for the end of that man is peace.

IMPRENTIT AT SANCTANdrois be Robert Lekpreuik. Anno. 1573.

TO THE MAY GODLY, ANCIENT, AND WORTHY Schir Iohne Wischart of Pittarrow
Knicht, M. Iohne Dauidsone wissis the continual assistance of the Spreit of
God, to the end, and in the end.
CONSIDDERING with my self (may worthy Knicht) the greit frailty and
vnsurenes of all strent his ^irthly quhatsu^euer, quhairin man leising god,
vsis to put his traist on the ane part, and the sure fortres and saifgaird of
vprichtnes, howbeit destitute of all aid warldly on the other part: I culd not
withhald my pen from uttering of that praise and commendatioun of vprichtnes,
quhilk in my mind I had consauit of the same. Being chiefly mouit heirunto be
the Miraculous (as I may weill call it) and may wonderful preseruatioun of
that may notabill seruand of God, and sinceir Preicheour of Christis
Euangell, Iohne Knox. Quha being bot of small estimatioun befoir the eyis of
the world (it greit befoir God) was hatit unto the deith. And that euin be
Kingis, Quenis, Princes, and greit men of the world, and finally be all the
rabill of Sathanis suddartis, in Scotland, Ingland, and France. ea, not only
was he hatit, and raillit on, bot also persecutit may scharply, and huntit
from place to place as ane unworthy of any society with man. And althocht
they were michtie and potent, ea, and wantit na evil will, and he on the other
side ane pure man, alane, and often times without help, or assistance of ye
world, it was he michtely preseruit, and as in a may sure saifgaird (all the
wickits attentis quha thristit nathing mair nor his blude being frustrat)
conductit to ane may quiet, peaciabill and happy end, to the greit
advancement of Goddis glory, and singular comfort of his Kirk, and to the
confusioun of ^^^the^ and disco^fort of all his wickit Instrume^tis. Thairfoir
(...) dotabil and evident ane docume^t of the loving cair (...) ^wardis his
serua^ds should not with him be bury it bot abide recent in memory till all the
Inhabitantis of this Realm in all ages to cum. I have preissit schortly in
this lytill paper to make, as it were, ane memorial of the same, and yat in that
language quhilk is may co^moun to this hail Realm, to the intent that
asweill vnleirnit as leirnit may be pertakeris of the same. Not that I think my
self abill to handill sa worthy ane matter worthelie in any tongue, bot that
partly I may schaw my good will in this matter, and partly to gif occasioun to
vtheris, that both hes mair dexceritie in sic thingis, and greiter
opportunity of time, to intreit the same at greiter lenth. That be calling to
mind this notabill exe^pill of Godis loving cair towardis us, we all in chir
feirfull dayis (quhairin he that seis not trial approaching neir is destitute
of Judgment) may be strenthnit and incourageit to ga fordwart vprichtly,
every ane in our a win vocatioun, without declyning outher to the richt hand
or to the left. And principally that our watch men faint not, nor begin to
look, or flatter with the world for feir of Tyra^nis, bot that they may have
brasin faces, and foirheidis of Iron aganis the threitnings of the wickit,
co^dempning impiety of all persounis in plane termis, following the ensa^^^ll
of this may zealous serua^d of God, of quho^e heirtofoir we have maid
mentioun, and that being assurit gif sa they walk vprichtly in dischargeing of
their office, that they ar in ye protectioun of the Almichtie.

And this small fruit of my sober trauellis, I have thocht good to offer and
present to ow (may worthy Knicht) not same kill for that, that I thocht it
worthy to be presentit til any: as that I wald let my good will and grate
mind, be the same appeir towardis ow, throw quhais procurement I obtenit the
benefit of that godly and faithful (thocht mockit a^^^lsly traducit of the
world) society, quhairof presently I a^ participant. For the quhilk I
acknawledge me, and my humbill service alwayis addettit to our honor. And
howbeit (as I mon confess) nathing can proceid of me that may in any wayis
correspond to our meritis towardis me: it sal the thankfulness of mind at na
time (God willing) be deficient. Quhilk is to be acceptit, quhair other thingis
ar lacking, in place of greit rewaird. And the rather have I takin ^auldnes to
dedicat this lytill Treateis unto our honor, ba^th because I understood, ow
ever to have been sen our Chyldheid, ane vnfeneit fauourar, and mantenar to our
power of vprichtnes, quhais praise in this lytill Volume is intreatit. And
also, that this notabill seruand of God (quhais michtie preseruatioun,
notwithstanding the wickitis rage, to ane quiet end, chiefly mufit me to this
business) was may belufit of ow quhile he leuit, and yat for yat greit
vprichtnes quhilk e saw from time to time may viuely expres the self in him.
And finally, that our honor may be mufit heirby, as e have begun and
continewit to this day ane zealous professor of Goddis word, mantenar of the
samin, and lufer of his seruandis: sa e may perseueir to the end of our life,
without sclander to our professioun, ever approving the treuth, and haitting
Impiety in all persounis, not leaning to warldly wisdom, nor louking for the
pleasure of greit men in the world: Sen nane of their thingis, bot only
vprichtnes can outher make ane plesand to God, or it sure in this world. And sa
traisting that our honor will accept this my sober offer (till God grant
better occasioun of greter) intill good part. I commit ow to the protectioun of
the Almichtie, that quhen it sall pleis God to tak ow forth of this misery, e
may end our life in the Sanctificatioun of his haly Name. To quhome be praise
and Glory, for ever, Amen. From Sanctandroi^ the XVIII. of Febr^

ANE BRIEF COMMENDATIOVN OF VPRICHTNES
SEN that we se men till have studyit ay.
Into this eirth sic strenthis to prepair
As micht be saifgaird to them nicht and day,
Quhen any danger dang them in despair.
Wald thou good Reider have ane strenth preclair, Prouer. 10.12.13.18. Ecclesi.
9. Psalm. 25.27.91.

May strange and stark to rin to in distres
This lytill schedull schortly sall declair
How that the surest Tower is vprichtnes.
Quhilk vprichtnes we may descriue to be:
Ane traid of life conform to Godds command, Job. 31.

Without all poysoun of Hypocrisy
Or turning to or fra, from hand to hand. Prouer. 5.

Bot stoutly at the word of God to stand.
Eschewing alwayis it for to transgres
Not bowing back for them that contramand. Psalm. 18.

This wayis we may descriue this vprichtnes.
For first their is na Castle, Tower, nor Town,
Nor raturall strenth, as Alexander sayis, Q. Curt. li. 7

Bot ma^nis Ingyne may vincous and ding down,
As that he had experience in his dayis,
Na strenth was sure to them that was his fais:
The Craig in Asia did beir witness, Q Curt. li. 7

Howbeit in hicht unto the sky it raise,
It was ouercum for laik of vprichtnes.
Euin sa that bailfull Bour of Babilone, Q. Curt. li. 5 Ieremi. 5^.

Na saifgaird was to Darius we reid,
Suppois it was ane may strange Dongeone,
And money ma I micht declair in deid,
Bot sic exempillis Foraine nane we neid,
Quhat surenes fand the Bischopis halynes,
Into Dunbartane quhair he pat his Creid.
It was not half sa sure as vprichtnes.
Psalm. 33.40.60. Esai. 31. Ieremi. 17
The force of men gif any will obtend,
Kindred, or friends to be ane gaird may strange,
All is bot vane, they can not man defend,
For quha mair surely into Royat rang,
Q. Curt. lib. 10.
Nor the greit Conqueror his freindis amang,
it was he poysonit as sum dois expres,
Intill his Camp quhilk he had led sa lang,
Than quhat is force of man till vprichtnes.
Riches and rent we ken dois not abide,
Prouer. 11. Eccle. 5. Job. 1. Psalm. 49. 1. Timot. 6. Zephan. 1. Ecclesi. 2.
Nahum. 3.
Bot flitts and fochis ever to and fra,
Than vane it is in them for to confyde,
Sen that we se them asweill cum as ga,
Thairfoir my freindis sen that the case is sa,
That warldly strenth can have na sickernes,
Sum other saifgaird surely we mon ha,
Quhilk is nocht ellis bot only vprichtnes.
Bot sum perchance that winks mair wylelie,
Will say they wait ane wyle that I na wist,
With iouking they will Iangill craftelie,
And on their feit will ay licht quhen they list:
Thinking all surenes thairin to consist:
Hypocrisy is quent with quyetnes,
Bot all begylit they ar into the mist.
For nathing can be sure but vprichtnes.
For quhat become of falls Achitophell,
2. Sam. 17.
For als far as he saw befoir his neis,
The Scripture schawis I neid not heir to tell.
The like of this in money Historeis,
Psalm. 7. Ester. 7.
I micht bring forth that to my purpois greis,
How Hypocrites into their craftynes,
Them selfis hes trappit with greit misereis,
Because they did eschew all vprichtnes.
Bot quha sa ever on the other side.
Ester. 6.
Hes preissit peirtly to leif vprichtlie,
Da^i. 6.
And be the treuth bound bauldly till abide:
Hes ever had the may security.
For they had God their buckler for to be,
Quhome we mon grant to be ane strange fortres, Psalm. 76. Psalm. 89.

Of quhome the Devil can not get victory,
Nor all the enemeis of vprichtnes.
Think weill my freindis this is na feneit fair,
For quha sa list of David for to reid, 1. Sam. 17.18.19.20.21.22 29.33. 2.
Sam. 2.3.5 8.15.16.18.20. ^. Sam. 23.

May se quhat enemeis he had alquhair,
And it how surely he did ay proceid.
Because he walkit vprichtly in deid.
He was mair sure from Saulis cruelnes,
Nor gif ten thousand men intill his neid,
Had with him been syne lackit vprichtnes.
Of sic exempills we micht bring anew,
Bot ane their is that preifis our purpois plane
Of Daniell that Propheit wise and true, Dani. ^.

How often was he in danger to be slane.
Into the Lyonis Den he fand na pane. Dani. 3.

The three Children the fire did not oppres.
I think this only History micht gane,
To preif how sure ane Tower is vprichtnes.
Bot it because exempills fetchit far,
Mufis not so much as they thingis quhilk we se,
I purpois schortly now for to cum nar,
Unto the but quhair chiefly I wald be:
That is to schaw the prufe befoir our Ee.
Of their premissis, as all mon confess
That hes seen God wirking in this country,
How ane hes been preseruit in vprichtnes.
It is Iohne Knox in deid quhome of I mean,
That fervent faithful seruand of the Lord,
Quhome I dar bauldly bide at till have been,
Ane may true Preicheour of the Lordis word.
I rak nathing quhat Rebalds heir record,
Quha never culd speik good of godlynes.
This man I say eschaipit fire and sword,
And deit in peace, in praise of vprichtnes.
(...) that this may be maid ma^e manifest:
P^ll (...) thing in special,
Tuiching this Lamp, on life quhill he did lest,
First he discendit bot of lineage small.
Amos. i. 7. Mark. 1.
As commounly God vsis for to call,
The sempill sort his summoundis til expres.
1. Cor. 1. Iaco. 2.
Sa calling him, he gave him giftis with all
May excellent beside his vprichtnes.
For weill I wait that Scotland never bure,
In Scot^^ ^^id ane man mair Eloquent.
Into pe^^^ adin^ also I am sure,
Was nane in Europe that was mair potent.
In Greik and Hebrew he was excellent,
And als in Latin tongue his propernes,
Was tryit trym quhen scollers were present.
Bot their were nathing till his vprichtnes.
For fra the time that God anis did him call,
To bring they joyful newis unto this land,
Quhilk hes illuminat both greit and small,
He maid na stop bot passit to fra hand,
Idolatry may stoutly to ganestand:
And chiefly that greit Idol of the Mes.
Howbeit may michtie enemeis he fand,
it schrinkit he na quhit from vprichtnes.
The grievous Galayis maid him not aghast,
Althocht the Prelates gold in greit did geif,
Ouir schipburd in the sey him for to cast,
He fand sic grace they sufferit him to leif.
ea, mairatour they did him not mischief,
As they did his Companeounis mair and les,
With pynefull panis quhen they their pythis did preif,
God fa prouydit for his vprichtnes.
In Ingland syne he did eschaip the Ire,
Of Ies^bell, that Monstour of Mahoun.
In Scotland nixt with terror him to tire,
They brint his picture in Edinburgh Town.
Bot son to Scotland (...) ^e ^^id him bo^^,
Quhat ba^^ he h^^ bid di^ to may go,
Send (...) and they Devils he good ^^ng down,
In spyte (...) ane that haitit ^p^^^ h^nes.
They that hes been chief in Authority,
For the may part had him at deidly feid,
it he eschaipit all their cruelty,
Howbeit oftymes they did deuyse his deid,
ea, sum (...) bin presitely be the heid,
Quha undertake his Di^igs for to dre^,
it bauldly be his baner he abaid,
And did not soul ane ioit from vprichtnes.
Bot chiefly anis he was put to ane preace,
Quhen that the Queen of tressoun did accuse him
Befoir her Lordis in haly Rudehous place.
Quhair clawbacks of the Court thocht till abuse him
Sa prude^ly this Propheit yair did use him,
Into refuting of their fulischenes.
That all the haill Nobility did ru^e him,
And praisit God for his greit vprichtnes.
Quhen Queen and Court culd not get him co^uict,
Bot sa were disapointit of their pray,
They fryit in fury that he schaipit quick,
it at the leist to get their wills sum way,
They wald have had him wardi^ for ane day,
In Daueis Tower, ea, for ane hour or les,
It was denyit for ocht the Queen culd say.
Their micht be seen how sure was vprichtnes.
Bot in quhat perrell trow e he was last,
Quhen Edinburgh he left with heart full fair,
Doutles na les nor any that hes past,
In spyte they spak that him they should not spair,
They should him schuit into the Palpet their
Because he did rebuke their fylthenes,
And mischant murder that infects the air,
^^ God preseruit him in Vpri^h^nes.
Money (...) dangers nor I can declair,
Be sey and land thi^ Propheit did sustens,
In France and Ingland, Scotland, heir and their,
Quhilk I refer to them that mair hes h^^e,
Intill his company and sic things seen.
Bot this far schortly I have maid progres,
To preif how God may surely dois mantene,
Sic as continue intill vprichtnes.
For this Excellent seruand of the Lord,
Unto the deith was haitit as we know,
For sinceir preiching of the Lordis word
With Kingis, Princes, hie estait and law,
it in their Ire him micht they not ouirthraw,
He did depart in peace and plesandnes:
For all the troublis that he hard us schaw
That he sustenit for lufe of vprichtnes.
And this is merwell gif we will considder,
Ane sempill man but warldly force or aid,
Aganis quhome Kings and Princes did confidder,
How he should fend from fury and their fead,
Syne leave this life with list for all their played,
He had ane surer gaird we mon confer,
Nor any warldly strenth that can be maid,
Quhilk was nathing bot only vprichtnes.
Bot sum may say quhairto should thou prefer
This vprichtnes quhilk thou extolls sa hie
Until all warldly stre^this that ever were?
Sen that the contrair daily we may se,
How vpricht men ar murtherit mischantlie,
Gene. 4. Math. 14. 2. Chro. 24. Math. 27.
As first was Abell with greit cruelnes,
Good Iohne the Baptist, and als Zachary,
ea, Christ him self for all his vprichtnes.
Eusebius To. 4 fol. 7.
Peter and Paull with money ma sensyne.
And of lait eiris in Ingland as we know,
Vide Sleidanum.
How money piteously was put to pyne.
And now in France that schame is for to sch^w.
James our good Regent rakkin in that ^aw,
Quha had rung it were not his richteousnes.
Sa, I can se nathing sa sone ouirthraw,
Man in this eirth as dois this vprichtnes.
To this I answer into termis schott,
Quhen warldly strenth is vincust and maid waist, Prouer. 12.

With it man tynis both courage and comfort,
Quhen it is tynt quhairin he pat his traist:
Bot quha that deith in vprichtnes dois taist, Prouer. 11. Math. 16.

Sall have the life that lests with ioyfulnes,
Sa they ar sure, because they ar imbraist
Be the Eternal for their vprichtnes.
Bot this sa lichtly we may not pas by:
I grant in deid quha preissis vprichtlie
To serve the Lord mon first them selfis deny, Math. ^^.

And na wayis dres to daut them daintelie
Bot them prepair for troublis Identlie, 2. Timo. ^. Psalm. 14. 1. Pet. 5.
Job. 1.

For troublis ar the bage they mon posses,
Sen Satan ceisis not continually
To troubill them that followis vprichtnes.
Q^hylis harling them befoir Princes and Kings, Luc. 11.

As rauing Reb^lds rudely to be rent,
Accusing them of troubling of all things, 1. Reg. 1^. 1. Reg. 12.

As cankerit Carlis that can not be content,
Except all things be done be their consent:
Now scornit, now scurgeit, Math. ^7. Ieremi. ^8. A^^. 12.
now ba^d with bitterness
Imprisonit, and sindrie fassiounis schent,
And sum times dreuin to deith for vprichtnes.
This is their lote oftymes I will not lane
Into this eirth that use to be vpricht,
Bot quhat of this my purpois it is plane:
That is, that they ar surer day, and nicht, Psalm. 51. Psalm. 1^8.

For all this woe, not any wardly wicht.
For in their conscience is mair quyetnes
In greitest troubl^s, not the man of micht
Hes in their Castells, without vprichtnes.
For qullen Belshazzer greit King of the ^^ist.
Dani. 5.
Ane thousand of his Princes had gart cal^,
Drinkand the wine befoir them at the Feist,
Intill his prydefull Pomp Imperial:
Euin in the middis of this his mirrie hall.
He saw ane sicht that sank him in sadness,
Quhen he persauit the fingers on the wall,
Writing his wrak for his vnvprichtnes.
Quhat sall I say I neid not till insist,
To schaw how they to God that dois Rebel,
In their may micht can not be haldin blist,
For in this world they do begin their hell,
Gene. 4. Esai. 66. Prouer. 15.
As Cayin did that slew the just Abell,
Within their breist they beir sic bailfulnes,
That tongue of man can not the teynd part tell,
Of inwart torments for vnvprichtnes.
Prouer. 14.
Bot they that walks vprichtly with the Lord,
In greitest troublis wantis not inwart rest,
Act. 5.
As the Apostillis doung for Godds word,
Reioysit that for Christ sa they were dressed,
Act. 13. Act. 16.
Peter in prisone sleipit but molest.
Paull in the stocks and Sylas with glaidnes,
Did sing ane Psalm at midnicht, sa the best
Surenes that man can have, is vprichtnes.
Sa be this surenes now I do not men^,
That Godds seruands ar never taken away,
Be cruel men, for the contrair is seen,
For God oftymes of his Judgments I say,
Letts them so fall, as thocht befoir the day:
To plague the world for their unthankfulness,
Esai. 3. Heb. 11.
Quhilk is not worthy of sic men as they.
Bot I mean this be strenth of vprichtnes.
That quhen it plesis God to let them fall,
Act. 7. 2. Timot. 4.
They have sic in wart comfort without cair,
That they depart with joy Angelical.
Of life assurit that lestis for ever ^^it.
And it sum time he doi^ his seruands spair,
To let the Tyrannis se his michtenes, Esai. 41. Ierem. 1.4^.

In spyte of them, that he can his alquhait.
Preserve may surely intill vprichtnes.
Quhilk we have seen as we can not deny,
Into Iohne Knoxis michtie preseruatioun,
Quhilk till our comfort we should all apply,
I mean that are the Faithful Congregatioun.
Sen he departit with sic consolatioun,
Euin as he leuit, he deit in Faithfulness,
Being assurit in Christ of his Saluatioun,
As in the end he schew with vprichtnes.
Sa is he past from pane to pleasure ay,
And till greit eis doutles until him sel^,
Bot for ane plague till us I dar weill say,
As sair I feir we fall heir schortly tell,
Schir wink at vice beginnis to tune his bell.
Bot on this heid na mair I will digres,
That good men hes mair rest in all perrell
Nor wickit in their wealth but vprichtnes.
Then sen alwayis we se that men ar sure
Throw vprichtnes quhidder they live or die, Psalm. 19.

Let all good Cristianes Employ their cure,
In their vocatioun to leif vprichtlie,
And cheiflie let all preicheouris war^it be,
That this day God and the good ^aus profes, Tit. 1.

Na way is to wink at sic Impiety
And chiefly do^, withstand all vprichtnes.
Taking exempill of this Propheit plane,
Quhome heir befoir we breuit in this bill,
Quha Godds reuelit will wald never lane,
Quhen men begouth for to delight in ill,
He wald not wane ane wy for na ma^n is will
For to rebuke Earl, Barrone, or Burges,
Quhen in their wickit wayis they walkit still.
Follow this Lamp I say of vprichtnes.
Let nouther lufe of friend, nor feir of sais,

Psalm. 40. Esai. 5.

For pleis it God out life to lenthen heir,

Sen both the Tiger and the Tod,

Thou wants ane watcheman that tuke tent,

And tynsall of the charge they bure.
Bot now I feir that thou sall se,
Greit missing of that man to be,
Quhen crafty heidis sall na mair hyde,
The hurde of their Hypocrisy,
Bot all sinceirne: set a side,
With policy will all things gyde,
Their Balamis birds fair may thou fei^:
Thairfoir be Godds buke abide,
And to sic Bablers give na en.
Give ^^range opinio^nis ^nteris in,
Tak tent quha sic things dois begin,
And with sic matoris mynts to mell,
For Satan coisis not fra fin,
The Kirk of Christ seiking to quell,
Sic folly faill not to refell:
For quhen the reik beginnis to ryfe,
The fire will follow as they tell,
Be it not quencheit be the wise.
Bot chiefly murne and make thy mane,
Thou Kirk of Edinburgh allane,
For thou may re^ by all the rest,
That this day thou wants sickin ane,
Thy special Pastor: and the best
That any Kirk had Eist, of west.
He did comfort the in all cair,
And the foirwairnd of thy molest,
Quhanby thou micht thy self prepair.
Their was na troubile come to the,
Bot he foirspak it oppinlie,
Thocht sum the matter than did mock,
Gif he spak suith now thou may se,
This day thy heid is in the ock,
God send the blyithnes of this block,
And freith the from thy falls above the,
For tho^ art the may fervent flock
That Scotland beiris, as deid dois prove the.
And give God sa h in dills the best,
Allace quhat sill cum of the rest,
Except repentance ^^n and red:
It is ane Mirror manifest,
Of dule and dolor to be dred,
To fall on them this barret bred.
Bot till our purpois to return,
Thocht of this feir thou salbe fred,
it hes thou matter for to murne.
Because that watchem^n (...)
That the in purity did plant,
And comfortit thy Congregatioun:
Bot it thocht he be gane^l grant
The Lord can send the consolatioun,
Gif thou give him dew adoratioun,
He will not leave the comfortles.
As alreddy thou he^, probatioun,
God grant thy Preicheours vprichtnes.
e Lords also that doit frequent,
The Loft in Sanct Geills Kirk lament,
That Bogill their that e hard blaw,
With quhome quhyles e were small content,
For the schai^p threitnings he did schaw:
it they maid ow sum quhat stand a^,
Thocht not so much as naid requyrit:
This day in grave he lyis full law,
Quhilk langtyme was of him, desyrit.
For seeing all things not go weill,
He said their should not mis ane reill.
That should the chaifest walkin up.
Gif he said suith this day e feill,
Luke gif God hes begun to quhup,
Bot their byds it ane fowrer Cup*
Except our manner e amend,
The dreggs but dout als e sall sup,
From quhilk danger God ow defend.
Sanctandrois als not to leif out,
His deith thou may deploir but dout,
Thou know is he lude the by the laue
For first in the he gave the rout,
Till Antechrist that Romische slave,
Preicheing that Christ did only save.
Bot last, of Edinburgh expressed.
Quhen he was not far fra his grave,
He come to the by all the rest.
God grant that thou may thankful be,
For his greit graces schawin to the,
In sending the his feruands true,
Amen. Thou heiris na mair of me.
Bot Kyle, and Cuninghame may rue,
Als sair as any that I schew,
To quhome this darling was may d^ir.
And other gentill men anew,
Quhome I have not reheirsit heir.
Than last of all to turn to ow,
That were our brethren, bot not now:
God grant agane e may cum ham^,
For we should wis our weill I vow,
As also did this man be Name,
Thocht sum said he did ow defame,
He prayit to God that e micht turn,
That e micht schaip Eternal schame,
Thairfoir our part is als to murne.
For doutles he was mair our friend,
Nor they that win kit, or manteind
our fulische factioun and vnfair.
In deid that e should not susteind,
He thunderit threitnings to the air,
To terrify ow mair and mair,
And rug ow back that e micht rue:
For he knew perseueird e their,
e were bot schipwrak but reskew.
Than all this land thou may lament,
That thou lacks sic ane Instrument,
Till sum not plesand, it, sa plane,
That all the godly was content.
Allace his like he left not ane,
Nor I feir fall not se agane:
Bot it let us nawayis despair,
For quhy our God dois it remane,
Quha can and will for his prepair.
For thocht his deith we do deploi^,
it is he not our God thairfoir:
As wickit warldlings wald obtend,
Gone is our God quhairin e gloir.
The le^ing God we make it kend,
Is he, on quhome ^e do depend,
Quha will not leave us in distres,
Bot will his seruands till us send,
Till gyde us throw this wilderness.
Thairfoit letting their Bablers be,
Quhais chief Religioun is to lie,
And all Godds seruands to backbyte,
Traducing this man principally:
Let them spow out in tha^ dispyte,
All that they will be word or write.
Like as him self is into gloir,
Sa sall all ages ay recyit,
Iohne Knoxis Name, with greit d^coir.
