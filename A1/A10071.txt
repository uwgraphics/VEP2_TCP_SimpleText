Seldom cleanely OR,
A merry new Ditty, wherein you may see,
The trick of a Huswife, in every degree:
Then lend your attention while I do unfold,
As pleasant a story as you have heard told,
To the tune of, Upon a Summers time.


DRaw near you Country Girls,
and ^^ssen unto me,
I Will tell you here a new conceit
concerning Huswifery,
concerning Huswifery,
Three Aunts I had of late,
good Huswifes all were they:
But cruel death has taken
the best of them away,
O the best of them away.
O this was one of my Aunts,
the best of all the three:
And surely though I say it my self
A cleanly woman was she,
A cleanly woman was she.
My Uncle careless was,
in wasting of his store:
Which made my Aunt to have a care
To look about the more,
To look, etc.
^hen Winter time drew on,
nee^e to ^lthollon day:
My Aunt did cash her wits about
To save her Straw and Hay,
To save, etc.
And like a provident woman,
As plainly did apeare:
She starved her Bullockes to save her Hay,
Until another year,
O this was one of my Aunts,
the best of all the three,
And surely though I say it my self
a provident woman was she.
But as she went to fee
her cattle in the fields:
When she comes home two pound of dirt,
Hang d^ngling at her heels,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
And there she let it hang
from Candlemas till May:
And then she took a hatchet in hand,
And chopped it clean away,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
In making of a cheese
my Aunt showed her cunning:
Such perfect skill she had at will,
She never used running,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
For having strained her milk.
in turning once about,
She had the best curd that ever you saw,
By the sent of the strayning clout,
O this was one of my Aunts,
the, etc.
The second part, To the same tune.


She was the choysest Nurse,
that lived in all the West:
Her face was white as the charcoale flower
So was her neck and breast,
O this was one of my Aunts,
the best of all the three
And surely though I say it my self,
a cleanly good Nurse was she.
The garments which she did wear,
did shine like the br^zen Crock*
And where she went she bore such a sent,
That ^he flies b^ew in her frock,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
My Aunt so cu^ious was,
as I to you may tell*
She u^ed to make ^at puddings,
In markets for to sell
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
The smallest candles end,
my Aunt would never loose:
It would help to make her puddings fat,
With the droppings of her nose,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
Another trick she had,
as I shall ^ow declare,
She never swept the house,
About some times a year,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
And when she swept the Hall,
the Parlor or the Spence:
The dust was worth to her at least,
A shilling or 14. pence
O this was one of my Aunts,
the, etc.
One day my Aunt was set
by the fire si^e a spi^ning:
As she knew well what was to do,
To woollen or to linen,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
A change came in her mind,
her work being in great have:
She burned her Tow her Wheel and all,
Because she would make no wast,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
My Aunt so patient was,
of this I dare be bold
That with her neighbors she
Was never known to scold,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
Her lips with loathsome words,
she seldom would defile:
But sometimes she would whisper so loud,
You might hear her half a mile,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
Yet one condition more,
unto you I will thou:
She washed her dishes once a month,
And set them on a row,
O this was one of my Aunts, etc.
If other wise she had,
but of a dishclout fail,
She would set them to the Dog to lick.
and wipe (...) with his tail.
O this was one of my Aunts, etc,
But to conclude in have,
I hold it not amiss:
I love a cleanly huswife well,
As may appear by this,
O this was one of my Aunts,
the best of all the three
And surely though I say it my self,
a cleanely woman was she.
