LONDON Imprinted by John Wolf, 1581.

TO THE RIGHTWORSHIPFVLL, Master GEORGE GORINGE Esquiere, one of her Majesty's
Gentlemen Pensioners: HENRY CHILLESTER wishes long life, with continual
health and prosperity to Gods good will and pleasure.
AS the unskillful caruer that wants both Art and judgment, cunningly to
contriue the work he takes in hand, and yet able to judge of his own
imperfection, finds means, (for the better advancement thereof) to erecte
the same on the top of some high pillar, or such like place, where the fault
cannot easily be perceived by the curious beholders: Even so (Right
worshipful) having perfected this my Youths wit, Or wit of Green Youth,
(a fit name for so simple a Subject) I was moved, partly of mine own accord,
(knowing your worthiness, which well appears to the world) and partly at
my friends request (that persuaded me you would courteously accept it) to
make my special choice of your worship, to supporte, and sustain by your
virtue and worthiness, this simple work, unworthy such a Patron. For though it
be sufficiently fraught with a few pretty conceits, yet can I not my self in
privy conceit, so much love or like it (as the Crow that thinks her own
bird fairest) to suppose, it may well swim through the sensural seas of such
as have either high Forheads, and sharp wits, or want of judgment, with
evil tongues, unless it be guyded by such a Pilate, as can safely conducte it.

May it therefore please your worship (of your courtesy) to allow my good
will, and hereafter to like of the work, I shall have what I especially wish
for in this behalf, and care the less for the sharp censure of such as
disfauoure my doings. For I know that Apollo for all his skill, refused not to
hear the harishe Pipe of Pan, though but a rural God. And Pallas, though in
Art she far surpassed Arachne, yet vouchsafed she to handle the thridde of
her spinninge, and to say that her web was well wrought, and cunningly
contrived. And Xerxes, a mighty Prince, thought no less well of the poor man
that presented him with a handful of water, then he did of the greatest gifts
that ever any bestowed upon him. And truth it is, that such men as are either
guyded by the rule of reason, or endued with the courteous gifts of gratitude,
do more regard the mind of the geuer, then the worth of the present.
Therefore to conclude, I hu^blie beseech your worship, with the force of
your virtue, to defend my YOVTHES WIT from the malicious reports of those
that mislike, and seek to disgrace it: And in so doing, your worship shall
give me incouragemente, hereafter to attempt a better work then this is: For
the smallest tree, (if it be well proyned) will prosper, and very light
labor not mislyked, is likely to grow so far onwarde, as to become
Industry it self. And thus abruptly finishing these rude lines, I commit
you to the tuition of the Almighty, Resting always

Your worshippes most humble at commandment, Henry Chillester.

TO THE READER.
MAy it please you amongst other books, some good, some bad, to peruse this my
YOVTHES WIT, Or WIT OF GREEN YOVTH, in such sort as they were woonte to
survey the Tables of Phidias, and the Pictures of Prazitiles, that had before
seen the excellent workemanshippe of Appelles, between whom and the other,
though there were as great difference, as between the least twinkling
Star, and the Sun it self, yet did they both like of the one as they had
cause, and look on the other when occasion served. The praise that Homer
purchased by his skill in Poetry, was not so great, that it could quite
disgrace the doings of his Inferiors: For Meuius and Bauius (though not so
excellent) yet were they allowed for Poets of many: some have desired to hear
an Orator of evil utterance, to the end they might afterward take the more
pleasure, when they hard one plead, that could pronounce his words
distinctlie, and with good discretion. Cato the wise man of ROME, was wont
oftentimes to vaunte, that he learned no less good by conuersing with fools,
and spying their faults, then he got wisdom by the wysest, and those of best
behavior: And therefore, I am thus far to entreat you for this my simple
work, that if it be not in your conceates, worthy to be likened to Appelles
Pattornes, ye will vouchsafe, at idle times, to gaze upon (...), as a table of
Phidias or Praxatiles. If it bear not the beauty of a sun beam, then liken
it to the least star that shines. If it be not comparable to Homers poesy,
that was taken as a sufficient dowry with his daughter in marriage: yet permit
it to be allowed of some, as were the verces of Bauius and Meuius, If it taste
nothing at all of a good Orator, yet accept of it, till a better come in
place. If it teach no wise conceate, yet esteem of it as a pattern of my
foolish conceate, whereby such as have judgment, may conceive (if they will) a
platform of some wisdom. Bear with me, I pray you, though I seem in this
linking of my lines together, half to riddle with you, and accept my good
will, For I have been as much troubled in contriuing these my conceits, as
they that build castles in SPAIN (as the French Proverb understands it)
Or, as a Hen with two Chickens, And so fare ye well.

In ZOILVM, Richardus W.
INuide cur acuis ringendo Zoyle dentes?
cur sulcat vultus ruga maligna tuos?
Sed tu Maeonidem ridebas Zoyle vatem,
and similis nunquam desinis esse tui:
An non est Iuuenum iuuenilia condere Scripta?
sic capitur studijs ipsa Iuuenta suis.
Ve Cereri grata est peragen dis messibus aestas,
Bacchus in Autumno dulcia vina bibit,
Sic matura dabit posthac maturior aetas,
intera hoc placida perlege mente, precor.
M. G. In commendation of the work.
SVch sugared sap, such dew of sweet delight,
As painful Bees that bide on Hibla hill:
From fragrante flowers both fresh and fair in sight.
With labor great, do galne their hiues to fill.
Such, and no more, the well disposed mind:
Within this book, by reading soon may find.
Then praise the wight, whose pains shall please thee so,
And please thy self with that which profit bringes:
And with thy profit, profit many more,
And then report by proof what profit springes
From our (Green Youth) and safely say thou this:
Such wit does want in grauer heads then his.
Th. W. To the Reader.
THe proverb says, wit goes not all by age,
the wise regard men's deeds and not their time
Let Zoylus then cease of his woonted rage,
and Momus grant that greenest wits may clime
To touch the top of highest things with praise:
Which Nestor scarce attainde in all his days.
Young coltes bears price before old restie iades,
young twigges stand fast, when taller trees decay:
The budding rose exceedes the flower that fades,
youth waxes ripe, whilst age does were away.
Then judge aright, and praise him for his pains:
That proves his theme, in praising youthly brains.
G. A. In commendation of the Author.
LEt hoarie hears, who long in painful soil,
with heavy hand have sowed Experience seed:
At harvest reap, in guerdone of their toil,
the name, and fame, of wisdom for their meede.
But yet for wit, let youth receive the praise:
As this our Youth does flow in these our days.
N. Skr. In the praise of his friend.
THough wanton will did wrangle late with wit,
though Soldior braulde, though Scholar cauil still
Manillas moan, though no man pity it,
nor woman-like, so lose a praise of will.
Though counsel then, that came from phisickes lore:
Does yealde as yet no salve to heal his sore.
Yet died not wit, he did but make his will,
I not deny but then he might be sick:
His addle head may were a kercher still.
for then his brain was touched to the quick.
But who so looks, shall see him here alive:
And well perceive how youth can him revive.
Mistres Marie P. In commendation of her servant work.
TO praise the wight whose deeds deserve no less,
were but to throw my words into the wind:
For each that sees his work, must needs confess,
(unless they swerve contrary to their kind,)
That he deserves far more then I can tell:
his works, his words, his deeds deserve so well.
R. W. gent. To his friend A N.
Lo for my friend I here do break my vow,
who erst have sworn in silence for to rest:
But for because my friend constraines me now,
both vows and oaths, I do accounte as jest,
And say and swear, as I have done of yore:
that such Green wits have seldom been before.
I. Io. Gent.
IN verse to write the praises of my friend,
I want the skill of learned Poets old:
Whose pregnante wit in Virgill may be pende,
(and not by me) his filed phrase be told.
Read, gallante youths, this book which he has wrote:
not for his own, but your delight, God wot.
I. H. To his friend A. N.
TO say of trothe, that this my friend does well,
and in the end his doings should prove badde:
My name, his fame, I should both by and sell,
and nether win, but both of us be sad.
So that to praise him further then I say:
I neither can, ne will, ne must, nor may.
YOVTHES WIT OR THE WIT OF GRENE YOVTH. WITH THE CASTLE OF Conceits, Choose
Gentlemen and mez-Dames which of these two shall best like you.
Two lovers being together in the night, the Man died for joy, the Maid for
grief: Whereof ensued the death of other two.
IN the city of Cessenna not long since, was dwelling a rich merchant named
Affranio, who had two children, a Son and a Daughter. Near unto him was
dwelling an other merchant named Gerardo, who had likewise a Son and a
Daughter, and as between the fathers there had of long time been great
familiarity, so did acquaintance grow and increase between their children,
specially between their Daughters: For Camilla the Daughter of Gerardo, (by
means of her brothers absence, who was resident at Rome, where he had
continued a long time as factor for his father,) having no body to keep her
company in his absence, resorted diverse times to Cornelia, who (her father
being dead) was then only Mistres of the house, which her brother Hannibal (as
sole inheritour of all his goods) did hold and enjoy after his decease: The
continual conversation of these two gentlewomen as it engendered between them
such perfect amity as could never be dissolved, so did it kindle a new fire in
the heart of Hannibal, which by the contemplacion of Camillas beauty, so
increased from time to time, and in the end took such deep root, that it
could not possibly be removed: This strange passion so tormented the mind of
the poor gentleman (who had never before been acquainted with the like) that
neglecting all his necessary affairs, he applied his whole care and study to
please and pleasure his beloved Camilla, who utterly ignorant of his grief,
showed him no better countenance then she did commonly to all other young
gentlemen of her acquaintance, which Signor Hannibal perceiving, and not
satisfied therewith would feign have made his meaning more apparent, craving
such comfort as the necessity of his cause required, but the fear he had to
offend, (and so to lose the favor whereof he was assured, by her continual
presence) did still deteyne him, and would never suffer him to prosecute his
purpose: Thus hanging between hope and despair, the one pricking him forward,
the other pulling him back, imagining now one thing, now an other thing, and
never resolving fully upon any thing, he became at last so melancolike with
musing and imagining on this matter, that losing his appetite to meat, and
desire to sleep, at the last he grew sick, and by little and little wasted away
as snow against the sun.

Cornelia seeing her brother thus pained applied her self (like a natural
sister) to provide him all things that she thought meet for the recovery of
his health, by Physic or otherwise, but his disease proceeding of no natural
cause, could neither be discerned nor cured by any Phisitia^ were his skill and
experience never so great: only their opinion was for the most part, that it
proceeded of some passion of the mind, which Cornelia understanding, who could
by no means imagine upon what occasion he should be so disquieted; to
understand the truth, she lay continually upon him, using all the persuasions
that possibly she might, to make him reveal unto her the cause of this his
grievous malladie, which at the last he did with much a do, telling her, that
it was only for the love he bare to her friend Camilla, which he had sought by
all means possible to suppress, but could not, being continually renewed by
the daily contemplacion of her celestial beauty.

Cornelia hearing these words, uttered by her sick brother, with grievous
sighs and great abundance of tears, knowing that it was then no time to
reprove his folly, but rather to provide a remedy for thextreame mischief
whereunto he was so unhappily fallen, comforted him with sweet words,
exhorting him to pluck up his spirits, and seek some means to remedy his
grief: Whereunto he replied that he knew not how to ease him self, unless it
would please her to discover his affection to her friend Camilla, and persuade
her to take some pity upon him.

Cornelia that loved her brother as her own life, gave him her promise that
when opportunity should serve, she would satisfy his desire, and make his
estate so well known to her in whom his only hope of help consisted, that she
had no doubt but that her tender heart would be moved to take compassion upon
him, when she should perceive that his intent was honest, and his affection in
deed vnfamed.

Hannibal was somewhat comforted with these kind words, and considering the
great amity that was between Camilla and his sister Cornelia, thought her
words might work such effect with her, that he should easily obtain his
desire.

Cornelia shortly after being with her friend Camilla talking of diverse matters
(as women will do when they he together) at the last she spyed her time, to
open her brothers case unto her, tellinge her what strange torments he
endured for her sake, affirming that without her help he was like to languish
without all hope of remedy, praying her therefore most instantly to have pity
upon him.

Camilla though she liked not well of these words that Cornelia had used unto
her, yet seeing her to be greatly grieved for her brothers sickness, she did ye
rather hold her excused, and would not greatly reprove her, but gave her to
understand that she took small delight in such amorous suitors, praying her from
thenceforth to trouble her no more with the like, assuring her (if she did)
that she should but lose her labor, and be far enough from obtaining that
she sought.

Cornelia though she were not satisfied with this answer, yet (being so nipt)
maidenly shamefastnes would not suffer her to proceed any further in the
matter, neither durst she show her brother what answer Camilla had made her,
least it should drive him to greater extreamities then he was in before: but
whether it were with watching, and the great pains that she took with him
continually during the time of his sickness, or by some grief she conceived in
the discourteous answer of her friend Camilla, or because she saw no means to
remedy her brothers seacelesse torment, she fell shortly after into a grievous
fever which constrained her to keep her bed, whereof when Camilla had
understanding, she came incontinently to visit her, and being with her all
alone, in a chamber next adjoining to the lodging where Hannibal lay, having
but a wall between them, so that whatsoever was said in the one, might easily be
hard in the other, Hannibal hearing his Camillas voice, asked his sister
Cornelia, who was with her, who answered him that there was no body but
Camilla, Hannibal being likewise alone at that present, calling his wits
together and taking more courage unto him then he was accustomed to have in
this case, taking his lute in his hand he began to sing as follows: Yield me
my heart, yield me my liberty.
From out this prison let me pass again,
That for thy sake, bide such extreamitie,
As never mortal man might well sustain.
If thou have vowed to tread Dianas trace,
If cruelty increase in thee by kind,
If thou disdain to grant thy servant grace,
Or can not lodge such, liking in thy mind:
Yield me my heart, that wholly then I may
Give up the ghost, when as my race is run,
Which now for love does languish night and day,
And has no power those painful pains to shun.
But if thy purpose be to keep it still,
Yet use it better then thou did before.
To vex the wight, no doubt the deed were ill,
That well deserves, thou should esteem him more.
Then, in thy breast, as reason does require,
My grieved heart vouchsafe to lodge at last,
That I may say, thou did not desire,
Nor wish the woes, that I so long did taste,
But that thy love though it were long conceald,
Was firmly sixth, and plainly now reueald.


And then began on the other side of the wall, with words interrupted with
sighs and great abundaunce of tears, to declare to Camilla his amorous and
extreme passion, humbly beseechinge her to take pity upon him, and not to
suffer him to finish his miserable life in the flower of his youth, through her
cruelty and want of compassion.

Of such force were these his prayers, that mollefying her tender heart, (which
she felt suddenly enflamed with an unaccustomed heat) she thought it great
cruelty not to have compassion upon him, and no less ingratitude to deny him
that favor which his entire affection and perfect loialtie had well deserved:
wherefore in frendlye wise she spoke unto him after this manner: Senior
Hanniball, I am contented to allow of your words, and cannot but like well of
your courteous offer, not supposing you to be one of those that with leude
practices do seek to deceive such simple souls as I am, who when they have
satisfied their wicked desire, report it amongst their companions, to the
great reproach and utter spoil of those that were so fond to believe them. But
rather then any such thing should happen to me, I desire to die the most
grievous death that may be devised, knowing rightwel, that when a woman has
once lost her good name, she has then no more to loose, the same being the
only riches that she can have in this world. It is therefore very meet that
we be somewhat circumspect in this matter, and if the love you bear unto me, be
so perfect as you profess, and that your meaning be none other then I imagine
it, you may demand me of my Father in marriage who I am well assured will not
deny you your honest request. By this means you may easily obtain your desire
and keep my good name unspotted, which is the thing wherein I chiefly delight
me.

Hannibal was well satisfied with these words, and greatly commending the
virtuous care she had for the preservation of her good name, promised so sone
as he had recovered his health to do as she had directed him. After this
Hannibal proved all means to procure his health, and being well recovered
caused certain of his friends to move his suit to Camillas Father, who knowing
his hability, and liking well of the offer, answered that he could be well
contented to bestow his daughter upon him, but would not resolve upon any
thing till his Son (whose name was Claudius) were returned from Rome which
he said would be very shortly.

Camilla knowing her Fathers answer imagined the matter to be fully concluded
for she thought assuredly that her brother would not be against it, wherefore
betakinge her self wholly to her friend Hannibal, her affection toward him grew
so great that it was nothing inferior unto his.

Whilst Claudius deferred his coming from Rome to Cesena, upon some occasion of
business that detained him longer then he thought for, these two lovers diverse
times had conference together, thinking by that means somewhat to aswage the
amorouse flame, that continually burned in their breasts, but this caused it
more and more to increase, and made them think every hour a year till
Claudius returned. But when they saw he stayed so long after his time
appointed, they caused themselves to be secretly married thinking to celebrat the
marriage at Claudius return, who cominge home shortly after was advertised by
his Father of the aliaunce that Hannibal sought to have with him, which (upon
what occasion I know not) he greatly misliked and would in no wise give his
consent thereunto: persuading his Father very earnestly for diverse causes that
he thought reasonable, to break of this match and in no wise to suffer it to
go forward, wherein the old man folowinge his Sons advise, did in all things
as he desired him, and answered Hannibals friends accordingly when they came to
know his resolution in the matter.

The two lovers understanding how contrary to their expectacion al things were
fallen out, (as it is our humane nature to desire that which is most denied us)
more desirous now then at any time before to be together, and freely to enjoy
each other, Camilla said to her beloved Hannibal: what, are not we handfast?
can we be put a sonder with a safe conscience? no verily, and therefore to make
the matter more assured (as I may very well without offense to Godward) I will
this night admit you to my bed: wherefore if about midnight you will repair to
my Fathers house, my maid that is alredie privy to all that has passed
between us, shall give her attendaunce at the back gate to let you in, when you
come, whereunto Hannibal very glad of so good an offer, willingly consented,
and when the hour was come, went with all speed to the place appointed, and
was privily conducted by the maid to Camillas chamber who received him very
courteously, and he imbrasing and kissing her with great affection, ravished
with exceeding joy, through this his unexpected pleasure, his senses failing
him, he pitifully dyed in the arms of his dear Camilla, who seeing this
strange adventure, twixte fear and grefe, was so grieuouslie tormented that
being unable long to endure it, at the last she fell down dead upon the
corpse of her beloved Hannibal.

The pore maid that was present, behoulding this pitiful tragedy, and seeing
no hope of recovery in them, cried for help so loud as she could. Claudius
that lay not far of, being awakened with this sudden clamor, came running
into his sisters chamber with his weapons ready drawn in his hand, to see
what was the cause thereof, and beholding there this pitiful spectacle,
knowing it was the body of Hannibal that then lay by his sisters, not stayinge
to hear what the maid would say to him, presently stabbed her in with his
dagger, and so leaving her for dead returned again to his own chamber.

In the morning this strange accident being noysed throughout the whole town,
and at the last coming to the ears of the Governor, he caused the maid to be
examined (that was not then fully dead.) and understanding by her how all
things had passed, caused Claudius to be apprehended, and within two days
after (the maid dying) condemned him to be beheded, whereupon he was presently
executed in the place, appointed for the punishment of all offenders: The two
lovers likewise with great lame^tation were both buried in one tomb, very
sumptiously prepared, in perpetual remembrance of their incomparable amity.

A Prince being enamoured of a bewtifull gentlewoman, perceiving a fauowred
servant of his to be greatly tormented for the love of the same gentlewoman,
gives him leave to enjoy her, and quenches his own heat by an other mean.
A Certain Prince (whose name I need not rehearse) soiorning for his pleasure
in the town of Blais, had amongst all his folowers one that he specially
favored, who walking one day abroad for his pleasure, beheld by chance a very
bewtifull gentlewoman, that was wife to a welthie merchant of the Town, and
findinge in her (as he thought) so many good gifts, as he never saw in any in
all his life before, he became so greatly enamoured of her, that he could never
be in quiet, but was continualy troubled in mind, practicing by all means
possible to find a remedy for his new passion, and so behaved him self that
the gentlewoman well perceiving his purpose and being vanquished with the like
affection, did by her looks and iestures give him plainly to understand, that
she liked well of his friendly offers, and would willingly satisfy his desire,
if opportunity did serve.

Duringe these hopes the Prince his master made a solemn feast, whereunto
were asembled all the Ladies and gentlewomen of any reputation in the City,
amongst whom this gentlewoman before spoken of, was one, who for her bewty,
neatenes in apparel and comely behavior, did as far surmount the rest, as the
pretty pigion does the foul black raven, or the fairest spring, the filthiest
pudle: to be short there was no comparison between them, so greatly did they
differ in all things: which the youthful, Prince perceiving, and wondringe
greatly at such excellent beauty, as she on the other side did at his
royalty, and the rare perfections that she perceived to be in him, love by and
by atached both their hearts, and inflamed them with such affection each
toward other, that they instantly desired a spedie end of their amorous
procedings, and so finely they handled the matter, that before they parted, it
was concluded between them, that the next night (her husband being from home)
they would mete at her house, and satisfy each other, with full assurance of
their unfeigned amity.

The love of this gentlewoman being thus removed from the Servant to the
Master, the last stood so greatly in her grace that the first was in a manner
quite forgotten, her sweet looks, converted to rigorous regards, she now set
him at naught, whom before she highly esteemed, which sudden alteration, so
tormented the mind of this pore gentleman, and drove him into such extreme
passions, that being quite altered from that he was wont to be, he seemed rather
a dead image, then a living creature. In these extremities he withdrue
himself into his chamber, and taking his lute in hand, song thereunto as
follows: Both love and death are now become my foes:
Of liberty has love bereft me quite,
So death denies his due to end my woes,
And lets me live (to work me more despite)
A wretched life, that lasts all too long,
Since all things tornes contrary to my mind:
My mind is grieved to bide such open wrong,
Such open wrong as no redress can find:
Yet see I well the cause of all my grief
Springs from the place where lay my most delight:
A small delight that lendes so bad relief,
A bad relief that so bereaues my right,
And to an other void of like desert
Yeldes that which should requite my passed pains
A grievous case, a cause that cuts my heart
So much the more because no help remains:
But (thus resolved) that whilst my life shall last
I will no more a woman's words believe
This hurt once heald, I hope my heat is past,
And then no more it shall my senses grieve
To think on love or lovers wanton toys,
I leave that life to such as like it best
Let them suck sorrow from their secret joys
I will hence forth devise to live in rest:
Fare well therefore thou false dissembling dame
Whose luring looks did lull me so a sleep
That when I felt the force of fiery flame
And saw my self in danger drowned so deep,
I could not leave the harm I lykt so well
Which now I loath, and will do while I live,
Thy winks, thy wiles, thy words, and all farewell:
To them that list my intrest whole I give,
That they may keep the thing with cost and care
Which I desird and should have been my share:


The Prince his master seeing him so suddenly, and straungely altered,
labored by all means possible to understand the cause thereof, which the
gentleman would not in any wise confess, but sought to excuse the matter as he
could, and make his case a great deal better then it was. The Prince therefore
seeing all his words spent to small purpose, in seeking to persuade him to
manifest his grief, and perceiving that the hour approached, wherein he
appointed to mete with this gentlewoman, whose love he had so lightly
purchased, being loath to prosecute his purpose without the company and
council of his favored servant, whom he had in all things found faithful
unto him, he secretly called him, unto him, and said. Though I have diverse
times demanded the cause of thy grief (which I imagine to proceed of love)
and can not be resolved in it, yet for the mutual amity that ought to be
between us, I will not conceal any secret of mine from thee: Know then for
certain, that I have of late been intrapped with the love of a gentlewoman of
this town, so fair and full of all perfections, as I think in all Europe
there lives not her like, whose happy company (if fortune be not too contrary
unto me) I hope to enjoy this night at my pleasure, wherefore having now
revealed this secret unto thee, as to him in whom I have most special affiance,
I pray thee vouchsafe to accompany me to the place where she remains that is
my only solace, and I assure thee, if thou will let me understand what it is
that thus troubles thy mind (which I heartily beseech thee) thou shall find me
as ready to satisfy thy desire in any thing, and as careful to redeem thee
from these dolors that now deprive thee of thy natural rest.

The gentleman knowing the perfect goodwill and unfeigned affection that his
Lord and master bare unto him, perceiving also by this his profred courtesy
how desirous he was of his well doing, showed him from point to point the
cause of all his grefe proceeding of love, and the ingratitude of her whom he
honored and esteemed above all other creatures, being the self same
gentlewoman that his Lord had chosen for his chefest friend, which when he
perceived whether he had cause to contemn him or no, I leave it to the
judgment of those that be lovers, whose nature is, to loath them that seek to be
pertakers of their loves or to take from them any part of their favor whom
they so greatly fancy? Notwithstanding this wise and worthy prince, preferring
the love of his friend before his own fond affections, took a clean contrary
course, for considering the miserable case whereunto love had brought this pore
gentleman, he resolved with him self rather to respect his health then his own
private pleasure, and resting upon this determination he said to the gentleman
as follows.

My friend though I have nothing in the world so dear and delightful unto me,
but I could willingly imparte the same with thee, though thou may dispose of
my goods as of thine own, and c^mmaund my person to do thee pleasure, yet love
that can allow of no parteners, will not permit us to be both pertakers of the
gentlewoman whom we both desire, thou art greatly pained for her sake and I
prefer the pleasure I might enjoy with her before all my worldly treasure.
These are two great extremeties, for as the one can well be endured, so may not
the other be well forborne: Thy case craves comfort, and my contentment, if
thou want thy will thou art in danger to perish, if I bridle my affections it
will bread me sorrow, notwithstanding so great is the love I bear unto thee,
that I do rather chose to deprive my self of this favor, then to se thee
languish for lack of that which is in my power to grant thee: Comfort thy
self therefore cast of this carefulnes, and despair no more but count thy self
assured of that thou sekest, she shall be thine that best deseruest her, thou
shall enjoy her wholly to thy self, I give her freely unto thee, and give over
all the intrest that I had or may have in her hereafter.

The pore gentleman hearing these kind words and perceiving his own error,
betwixt hope to obtain his desire, and ^eare to offend his good Lord, whom he
honored with all reverence due to so worthy a person, not knowing how to
answer or what to imagine, he stood as still as a stone, staringe in the
princes face, sheding great abundance of tears, and as one bereft of all his
senses unable to utter one only word a great while together: At the last
coming to him self again, with all humility he craved pardon for the offense
which he had unwittingly committed against his majesty, protesting that he
would rather choose to die a thousand deaths if it were possible then
willingly seek to impeach the least part of his pleasure.

The Prince remaining firm in his liberal purpose, after he had studied a
while by what means he might best beguile the gentlewoman, and bring his friend
relief, having found a fit devise for that purpose, he commanded the
gentleman to attend upon him, and upon pain of his displeasure to do
whatsoever he should appoint him, and so incontinently they passed together
toward the gentlewomans lodging, where they were finely received at their
coming, by a pretty maid, that she had made priuey to her meaning, who like a
good servant, careful of her Mistres commandments, conveyed the Prince very
privily into her chamber, where she attended his coming, whose friendly welcome
and amorous enticements, had been enough to move the chastest mind in the world,
to take delight in her, and forgetting al friends and friendship, to betake him
self wholly unto her. But this good Prince, whose mind was fully bent to seek
the safety of his friend, when he and the gentlewoman were laid together in the
bed, and the candle put out, faining as though he rise to ^ase him self,
went to the gentleman his servant, whom he had left in an other lodging not
far of, and sending him thither to supply his rome, satisfied him self with
the maid, that was a pretty (...) gerle* whom with his good persuasions, and
liberal promises, he easily obtained to be at his commandment in all
things, wherewith he did well content him self for the time.

The gentleman that was now in tharmes of his Lady, whom he loved so dearly,
when he had well satisfied his desire, and aswaged his heat, with her sweet
imbracement, he asked her pleasantly whether she thought that the greatness of a
Prince, was able to show more perfect affection, then the good heart and loyal
service of a mean gentleman.

The gentlewoman hearing his voice which she knew very well, perceiving thereby
that it was not the Prince whom she had pleasured, but the gentleman that she
thought to displease and deprive of that favor, which his entire affetion had
well deserved, understanding very well to what end his words did tend, sighing
a little she said.

If my wisdom had been as great as my beauty, I had not deprived my self of
liberty, to make me a slave to one that set so light by me, neither had mine
expectacion been thus deceived, nor my self so beguiled: But seeing it is so
fallen out, and that the liberality of a Prince has been so great, to
prefer the love of his servant, before his own private affections, it is
great reason that (...) should hold me contented, and show my self as
liberal (...) you (whose loyalty has well deserved it) as he has done that
gave me this good example, wherefore I do here wholly betake my self unto you,
accepting you for my only friend so long as li^e, and your good liking shall
last, with assured promise, never more to a^^er my choice, or allow of any
other in that respect, but always and in all thing, to be most humble at your
commandment.

These and such like words she used unto him, and afterward falling into more
pleasant talk, they passed the time till morning came, and then the gentleman
with a gracious Conge, taking leave of his Mistress, departed with the Prince
his master, being both well satisfied, who diverse times after, when occasion
served, received the like contentemente. But now least I engender in your
hearts some extreme envy, by speaking overmuch of this their exceeding
pleasure, I think it best to hold my peace, and so avoid the inconvenience,
which otherwise might ensue.

A lamentable discourse of the love between Barisor, and Flora, with the
piteous end of them both.
Not without great reason do the Poets feign foolish love to be naked, for
undoubtedly he is naked of all good virtues. They do likewise make him blind,
to show that for want of good foresight, he suffers him self to fall into all
manner of vices: I may then very well conclude with them, and say that his
subjects are so naked, so blind, and void of natural sense, that being in a
manner dispoiled of all good virtues, they suffer them selves, to be led into
such filthy pudles, from whence they are not able to get out again* till their
hard fortune do make them feel the smart of their wilful folly, as plainly
appears by the story ensuing.

The most renowned king of Hungary, the last that reigned in those parts,
before the Turk had wasted the country, and brought it under his subjection,
did in his life time, hold an open Court and had in his train, a great number
of gentlemen and Ladies, so well accomplished in all perfections, as there was
no Prince in Christendom comparable unto him, where love had so lively
displayed himself, that it was hard to find in any other Court whatsoever,
more affectionate servants to their Ladies, then was one gentleman of his
house named Barisor, who though he were but basely borne, and little favored
with the gifts of fortune, notwithstanding nature far more gracious unto
him, made him in all virtue and beauty so perfect, that without comparison he
was accounted the most accomplished gentleman in the Court, and had such
advantage above all other, that as well in all manner of Gentlemanlike
exercises, as also in martial exploites, he always showed himself far to
surmount the rest which made him to be so well-beloved and esteemed of every one,
especially of the Ladies of the court, that by means of the good countenance
they gave him generally, he took great pleasure oftentimes to bear them
company, showing him self so courteous and serviceable unto them, that thereby
he drew unto him the hearts of most of them.

In this honorable troop, there was a Lady named Flora, of an ancient house,
and very rich in possessions, who seeing this gentleman so much esteemed and
praised of every one save only of her, could no longer forbear to show him the
like freendly and favorable countenance. He on the other side beholding the
delicate complexion and natural beauty of this worthy Gentlewoman, was in
such sort surprysed, that he did in a manner lose all his senses. Love
incontinently (during these amorous regards) using his accustomed force, at one
instant tied the hearts of these twain so straightly together, and brought
them to that pass, that it was easy to judge by their outward countenance
how they were inwardly tormented, which though it seemed very strange unto
them at the first, specially to the young Lady, yet when it had once taken
root in her heart, it was so surely settled, as it did accompany her to her
grave: Thus to discover their secret thoughts having yet none other means but
only the amorous glaunces of their gasing eyes, they could not sufficiently
discover the force of this new fire, wherewith they were so greatly inflamed,
which so much tormented the mind of the poor Gentleman, that being on a day
al alone in his chamber, and almost out of his wits through extreme sorrow,
he cast him self down upon his bed thinking to recover some rest, but Love,
and the continual remembrance of this new passion, so often renewed his grief,
that in the end he was enforced for the ease of his mind, to sing to his Wife
these verses following.

Another to the like effect.

Like as the Steer that never felt the Yoke,
But lived free in Woods and pastures still:
Or like the horse that never yet was broake,
Nor brought with bit t'obay the Riders will.
So rangde I long, and wandered often astray,
Untaught to bridle my desires alas,
Amidst my thoughts blind Cupid bore such sway,
That bastard boy, not he whose son Jove was.
Whose brande was smothering heat not much vnle^ke
To that clear flame which broyleth in my breast.
Wherein I joy as in the thing I seek.
And therefore since I therewithal am blessed,
And Reasons yoke has made my senses tame:
I cry, O happy yoke, O noble flame.
His song ended, sighing bitterly he said: O unhappy and miserable wretch that
I am, well worthy am I to lose both life and liberty, to become a slave and the
most unhappy gentleman on earth, that have settled mine affection in so high a
place, that not so much as mine eyes, much les my thoughts shall ever be able to
attain unto it, which makes me worthy of a thousand deaths, if it were
possible to endure so many: what may I then expect, but even my utter ruin
both of body and soul, seeing my self without all hope of remedy at the very
beginning of my love, considering the difference of our degrees: Her great
wealth, and my want: Her plenty, and my poverty.

In these words, which were mingled with an infinite number of passions, he
could find no reason at all for him to recover any rest. The poor Lady on the
other side, that fried in the same fire, withdrew her self into her chamber,
and framing her countenance (as she could very well) by fayning her self sick
she found the means to ^e alone, to the end she might the better bewail her
case, without being perceived of any, wherefore provoked by the heat of her
new love, which took from her all Maydenly modesty, she said to her self.

Alas, is it meet this cruel tirant should so hardly entreat me, to make me
will, that I may not, when I may not as I would? Ah, ah Barisor, well may I
count my self unhappy, that ever I saw thee, seeing that sight, has engendered
this love, which at the beginning seems so hard and grievous unto me, and
will (I fear me) in the end be a cause of greater evil, and peradventure the
utter ruin of us both. My only desire is to enjoy thee, that art my only
comfort: But alas, I see no way how to bring it to pass, without greatly
offending my parents and mine own honor, and therefore should death be more
delightful unto me, then still to endure this extreme torment, that my
miserable life makes me so long to endure.

These poor passionate lovers, so long maintained their inward affection by
outward looks and secret favors, that the poor Gentleman unable to endure
his consuming griefs, presuming upon the courtesy of his mistres, whom by all
evident tokens, he perceived to burn in the same fire that he did, seeing her
one day all alone at a window very sad and pensive, pricked forward by an
amorous desire, he found the means to enter into her chamber unseen of any,
save only of a trusty maid that attended upon her, and fayning to bring her
news from some friend of hers (as one that was co^uersant among the best) he
did most humbly and graciously salute her, and then began with a trembling
voice to utter these words.

Madame, though I know the greatness of your beauty and the place ye hold, to
be such as should move any man of my degree to be well advised what he will say,
before he presume to speak unto you, least by his unadvised proceeding, he do
abridge some part of that honor, which is rightly due unto you, whereof I
always had, and ever will have as great care and regard as any the most
affectionate servant that may possibly present himself before the eyes of so
worthy a Lady: Notwithstanding, confessing the cruel torment that grieuouslie
afflicts every part of me, for fear least I should obtain no place in her
honorable service, whom I desire to obey and please in all things, which would
not have suffered my life to continue till this time, had it not been conserved
by the hope I had to be so employed to the death: dispayring of al succor, I
have now taken this presumption upon me, humbly beseeching your accustomed
bounty to accept this excuse of your pore slave that desires no longer to
live, then his life shall be acceptable unto you, and bearing with my
indiscretion, to impute the fault to your excellent beauty, that has
entangled me, and so restrained my liberty, that finding my self so
wonderfully surprised, I am (said he, the tears standing in his eyes) wholly
tied to your answer, whereby I attend the last and final sentence of my life
or death.

The young Lady little acquainted with such amorous discourses (as it is the
nature of such tender youth to be somewhat shamefast) at first cast down her
eyes to the ground: but anon after (overcome with these sweet words. and
unable to resist the feruency of this strange passion) at this first encounter
(putting all shame under foot) she looked up again, beholding him with a
sweet, and lovely countenance, for whom she dyed a thousand times a day, and
then casting forth a deep sigh, answered him with a trembling voice, after
this manner.

Senior Barisor, I must needs confess, that at the first encounter, my forces
failed me, and the honor I ought to my reputation being greatly attainted by
the like mishap, (whereof unawares I my self am the cause) at every word I
would speak, my heart panted, and was grievously perplexed, my mind likewise,
and all the other parts of my body, were so weakened, that I had in a manner, no
use of them at al, which now enforces me (having hitherto forgotten my self)
to let thee understand, that the very first time, I was surprysed with thy
honest behavior, I felt in my self such extreme anguish, that me thought it
pulled my heart out of the accustomed place, to join, and unite it with thine:
and since that time, thy virtues, and the knowledge I had of thy fervent
affection (the force and assurance whereof is now discovered) has been so
lively imprinted in my mind, that through despair, and extreme passion, I
thought a thousand times, that my soul would have departed from my body,
supposing all my life long, to keep secret this amorous flame, which, whilst
I had sought too much to suppress, increasing more and more, would in the end
have quite consumed me. But since upon so just occasion, I see my good, present
without dissimulation, unable to deny that which ye know as well as my self,
I humbly beseech you, seeing I have so much forgotten my self, as to put my
honor into your hands, to be circumspecte in your dealing, and forecast the
dangerous mishaps, and inconveniences that may ensue, if our love come to
light, considering the greatness of my house, and how many noble personages
there are, that will seek to hinder the favor that I desire to bear unto you,
which I shall not be able so well to dissemble, but that at one time or other it
will be perceived.

Love now, that had deeply wounded these two Lovers at the heart, desirous to
make them know his full power and puisance, when he had quite berefte their
liberty, so planted his ensign in their entrails, that from the poor Lady
Flora he took all ability to resist, and gave to Senior Barisor a rash
desire to enterprice that, which after cost him his life, for geuinge bridle
to his unruly affections, with a long and gracious kis, confirmed his unfeigned
amity, and ravished with exceeding joy, through the continual pleasure, he
conceived in her many courtesies, finding him self alone at liberty, he made
request of that, which most contented his libidinous desire, and so long
continued his haunt, that at last, the bruit of suspicion, did not only offend
the ears, of all the gentlemen of the court, but also of her Parents, who
determined to use some rigorous correction, and to remove her far from him, by
whose means she had gotten this il report, and lost her good name: which when
she perceived, she determined rather to make her self unhappy for ever, then
to live without the company of her faithful, and well affected servant.

And after good deliberation, seeing her self greatly urged to forsake the
Court, through the fury and fear she had of her displeased friends, she
agreed with her best beloved (to the end they might freely enjoy their Love,
some where else) to forsake the Court, and her Country, with all convenient
speed: wherefore, the better to bring their desire to pass, they caused them
selves to be married as secretly as they might, and setting all their affairs
in good order, when they were furnished of money, and all things that each of
them severally according to their ability, were able to procure, for fear to
be discovered, they stole away in the night, and traueled by unknown ways
that were not commonly trad^^^, til they came to the sea side, where they took
(...), with purpose to pass toward Italy, thinking there to spend the rest
of their life happily, and as their heart desir^d: but cruel fortune,
inconstant and envious of the good that be fore she had granted them, turning
their sweet into sower, and their pleasure into great displeasure, so
extremely handled them, that their miserable mishap may be a good example to
all other, to beware of the like, when they find themselves disposed to take so
dangerous a wise.

These two fugitive Lovers being embarked, as aforesaid, before they were fully
ten miles, from the haven there rose so great a tempest in the sea, that the
sky being covered with many dark clouds, and the water troubled with the
vehemency of the wind, that it seemed al things were quite confounded and
brought into a confused Caos so that the boldest in the bark, and he that had
best skill was feign to give over his task, and commit all to the mercy of
the time, which was so dangerous, that the ship ouermatched by the vehemence
of the winds, was broken all to pieces, against a hard rock, and all that
were in it drouned and lost, save only Barisor and Flora: For Barisor
(strengthened by the vehemencye of his love) holding his Flora in his arms, all
be blobred with weeping when he saw the eminent danger which might no way be
avoided, he cast her upon his back, and with an invincible courage leapt into
the Sea, and puttinge himself, to the power and conducte of the tempestuous
waves, brake the billows with his body, as a Dolphin with his broad finnes.
The Lady acknowledginge the great diligence of her poor lover, said unto him:
Alas my dear friend, I greatly fear, that by seeking my safety we shall both
be drouned: nay sweet Lady (said Barisor) thy company is such a comfort unto
me, and my desire to preserve thee so great, that it makes me more swift then
the wind, and stronger then the waves that strive against me. The sorrowful
Flora bending her self to kis her bearer (the best recompense that then she
could make him for all his pains) it gave the poor gentleman so great
courage, that with the help of the time, and the sea which waxed calm again,
he gate to land, in a desert Island, inhabited by none but wild beasts. So
soon as they were arrived in this place, they loking back on a sudden,
perceived a huge Lion hard at their heels, wherefore thinking that he would
have devoured them, and so with their life to have ended all their miseries,
they prepared themselves with patience, to abide their unhappy destiny, and
like friends to die together. But the cruel beast (whether it were that he had
before satisfied himself some where else, or that the heavens had so appointed
it) contrary to al expectation, departed from them, without offering them any
injury, or using any violonce toward them.

When they had escaped this danger, for fear to fall into the like again,
they wandered up and down three whole days together, to seek some place of
security, but in all that time they saw no earthly creature, nor found any
harbor, but only the wild desert, and the maine sea, that environed it round
about, wherefore being extremely pinched with hunger, and faint with running,
they were constrained to rest their feeble bodies, void of al natural strength,
hard by the sea side, where being couched together in this miserable plight,
each embracing other, almost dead for want of food, and not able to do any
thing but weep and sighe, Barisor said to his beloved Flora: Alas my dear
heart, thy sweet and delicate youth, unable to endure the extreme anguish of
this deadly famine, must needs pearish, without any hope of recovery. Ah my
dear friend, said she, I feel myself greatly eased by enjoying thy friendly
company. Then pausing a while, and fetching a feeble sighe, she said again:
Alas poor soul, I see thou may no longer endure this dolor, all the forces
of thy pining heart do fail thee: Not in love (replied Barisor) though in
this earthly bodies, our souls (so united, that nothing has power to part
them) shall ascend to the heavens together, and so long as any gasp of breath
remains, satisfy the^ selves with these two kisses, now cold, for want of
natures gifts. Thus lamentably complaining, and straightly embracing, at the
last they gave up the ghost, and shortly after were found by certain strange
merchants that came on shore, to furnish themselves of fresh victual, being
driven upon this Island by tempest, who when they saw the dead bodies of these
desolate lovers, newly deceased, but past al recovery, perceived by all outward
appearance, that they died for want of food, wherefore lamenting their case
(which seemed very strange unto them) they buried them after the best manner
they might, and then departing from them, they departed on their purposed
voyage, where they made report of this strange accident, and likewise in all
other places where they happened to come, and amongst the rest, in Hungary, so
that in the end, it came to the ears of those that were acquainted with the
late escape of Barisor and Florinda, who knowing by all evident tokens, that
these pitiful news concerned them, some were glad, because they might now
with more assurance, enjoy the large revenues that belonged to Flora, others
reproved their folly, but all in general lamented their loss, specially such
as were lovers, to whose mind this strange example was no small terror.

Behold here, Gentlemen, the force of foolish Love, which inflameth the hearts
of the greatest, oftentimes bereaueth them offense, and makes them careless of
al duties, who, the greater, and more noble that they be, the more care they
ought to have, not to remitte any thing, how small so ever it be, that may be
any blemish to their reputation: For it is most certain, that whosoever once
forsakes God, and suffers himself to be led away with every foolish passion,
that provoke him, he must needs fall into such dangerous ways, as will lead
him at last to utter perdition, which he shall never be able to avoid.

Constance loving Martuccio Gomitto: when she heard that he was dead,
desperately put her self all alone in a bark, which being transported by the
wind to Suse in Barbary. From thence she went to Thun^s, where finding her
friend Martuccio alive, and in great authority she bewrayed her self unto him,
who marrying her shortly after returned with her very rich to Lippare: Wherein
is plainly set forth the force of love, and the steadfast affection of those
that love faithfully: with a perfect example of the ficklenes of fortune, who
never abides custom, but every day altreth her estate, aduaunsing one, and
ouerwhelming an other, and sometime greatly abasing them whom she minds to
bring to a better state.
NOt far from Cicilia, there lies a little Island named Lippare, the
inhabitants whereof are chiefly maintained by marchaundise and navigations: In
this Island a virgin of very good parentage, named Constance, was borne, and
brought up, who for her beawtie and virtuous behavior was well beloved, and
greatly desired of many in marriage, but specially of one Martuccio Gomitto, a
comely and courteous young man, not very welthy, but well skilled in ye art he
professed, to whom this virgin did likewise bear so good affection, that she
never thought her self well without his company, whereof when Martuccio was
assured, purposing to make her his wife, he demanded her fathers good will,
which he denied him, saying he would bestow his daughter upon one that should
be well able to maintain her, to the end she might be a comfort to him in his
old age.

Martuccio greatly grieved to see him self rejected, and in a manner despised
for his poverty, prepared a little vessel and furnishing it with all things
fit for his purpose having also drawn diverse of his friends and kinsfolk to
take part with him, he made a vow never to return again to Lippare till he
were rich: wherefore departinge from them, he began to practice p^racy on the
borders of Barbary: pilling and spoiling all that he found too weak to resist
him, wherein fortune was very favorable unto him, if he could have taken the
time whilst it served. But he and his companions not contented that they were
in short time become very rich, in seeking to get more, they were all taken by
certain Saracins, who shutting them up under their hatches carried them to
Thunes, where they were committed to prison and long after kept in great
misery, whereupon news was brought to Lippare for certain, by many credible
persons, that all they that were in the little bark with Martuccio were
drouned. Which Constance hearing (who was grieved without measure at his
sudden departure) she greatly lamented amongst the rest, and determining to
live no longer, because her heart would not serve to make away her self by any
violent means, she sought to find some new necessity to hasten her desired
end: For which purpose going one evening forth of her fathers doors toward
the sea side, she found by chance a fisherbote in the haven somewhat distant
from the other ships, which (by means that the owners were newly arrived)
was furnished with mast, sail, and oaers, which Constance perceauing presently
entered into it, and (having a little skill in navigations, as most of the women
of that Island have) she lanched into the deep, and casting ouerbord the oaers
and rudder and all things else wherewith the boat might be guided, hoised her
sail and committed all to the mercy of the wind, thinking it would either
ouerwhelme the boat (being vnbalaced, and without a pilote) or else drive it
upon some rock, and so break it all to pieces, and so being unable to avoid
the danger when she would, must of necessity be drowned: In this mind weping
bitterly, she wrapped her clothes about her head and laid her down under the
hatches: But it fell out contrary to her expectacion, for the gentle Northwest
wind did blow so full and freshly, that by the next night after she went a board
the bark, it brought her within a hundred miles of Thunes, into a haven near
to a town named Suse: The young virgin felt not whether she were on land or in
the sea, for whatsoever happened, she never lifted up her head, nor never
thought to lift it up again.

By good hap, as the bark stroke upon the shore, there was a poor sea^aring
woman hard by, laying forth her fisher men's nets to dry in the sun, who
marueiling greatly to see it run on ground with full sail, and thinking that
the fishermen were a sleep within, she went a board the bark, and finding no
body there, but this poor desolate virgin that was the^ fast a sleep
(wondering greatly at so strange a case) and perceauing by her garments that
she was a Christian, she called her diverse times so loud as she could, and
when she had waked her, she asked her in Latin, how it was possible for her to
come thither, all alone in that little bote.

The virgin hearing her own country language, doubting that some contrary
blast had brought her back again to Lippare, started up sodainlye and looked
round about her: But not knowing the country, and yet seeing her self on
land, she asked the poor woman where she was: who aunswering her, said: My
daughter thou art now near to Suse in Barbary: The poor virgin hearing this
story that the had so well escaped the danger of the seas, and fearing to fall
into the hands of these barbarous people that would abuse her, not knowing what
was best to do, she sat her down on the botes side and wept bitterly.

The good old woman seeing what sorrow she made, greatly pitied her case and
comforting her all that she might, and entreated her to go with her into a
little house she had upon the shore which at last, after long and earnest
persuasion she was contented to do, and being there the old woman so ^^nely
flattred her that in the end she told her by what means she was arrived there:
The good old woman knowing by this means that she had fasted long and must
therefore needs be a hungered, set before her such simple fare as she had, and
entreated her so much that she got her to eat a little. Constance being now
somewhat refreshed asked the old woman what she was, who answered that she was
of the Trappany, and that her name was Chereprise, and served certain
Christian fishermen dwelling in that country.

The young virgin (though she were greatly grieved) yet hearing Chereprise
named, her mind gave her straitwayes that she had heard the name before, not
knowing any cause that should move her thereunto, and began now to hope, she
knew not what, and did no more desire to dye as she was wont to do, desiring
the old woman without enquiring any further of her estate, to have compassion
on her youth, and give her council how she might keep her self from
receiving any injury, which the good old woman promised her to do: Wherefore
leaving her alone in the house, she went with all speed to take up her nets,
and then returning back again, when she had foulded and laid them up
handsomely together, she led Constance with her to Suse, where being arrived,
she said unto her.

My daughter I will bring thee to the house of a good Saracin Lady, for whom
oftentimes I do such business as she shall please to appoint me, she is an old
gentlewoman very wise and charitable, I will recomend thee unto her so well as
I can, and I am sure she will receive thee willingly, and use thee as if thou
were her own child: And for thy part, when thou art with her, conform thy
self to serve her well and faithfully, that thou may win her favor, and
continue it until such time as it shall please the Lord to send thee better
fortune.

This said, she brought Constance to the Ladies presence, who when she knew
what she was, and understood what had happened unto her (for Chereprise had
informed her thereof at large) she earnestly beheld her and pitying her case,
the tears tickled down her cheeks, then receiving her into her service, she
kissed her, and led her by the hand into her house, where she remained after
that amongst other women (without the company of any man) that were
continually employed about diverse kinds of curious works, that they wrought
with the needle, which Constance learning in short time began to work
amongst them, and by her good behavior and great diligence, won the favor not
only of her Mistres, but also of other that were conversant with her, who
quickly taught her to understand and speak their language.

Whilst Constance was remaining at Suse, her loss being greatly lamented in
her fathers house, it happened that in the time of Mariubdile King of Thunes,
there was a young Lord of a great lineage and very puisant remaining in Grenado,
who challenged the realm of Thunes to be his and for that cause leauying a
huge army, he came to make war upon the King, thinking to drive him out of
the country.

These things coming to the ears of Martuccio Gomitto, who could very well
speak the Barbary language, when he understood that the King sought to make
himself as strong as he could to withstand the malice of his enemy, he said to
one of his keepers: If I might be permitted to speak with the King, I could
give him such council as might easily gain him the victory: The keeper told
his Master what Martuccio had said, who went incontinently to make report
thereof to the King, who commanded Martuccio to be brought before him, and
being come, asked him what his council was: Martuccio with all reverence
answered him in this manner.

Worthy Prince since the time that I have frequented your country, I have
always had good regard to the order of your fight, and perceive (unless I be
deceived) that your greatest strength consists in archers, wherefore in any
conceit if it might be so brought to pass, that your enemies should want
arrows, and your people have plenty, it must needs be that they shall be
vanquished and you have the victory: In deed said the King if this could be
done, we need not to doubt of the conquest. Surely Sir (said Martuccio) if you
please it may easily be done and in this manner. First you must cause the
stringes of your archers bows to be made a good deal less the^ those that
are commonly used, which done you must likewise cause the notches of their
arrows to be made fit for those strings, but this most be done secretly and
with such expedicion, that your enemies have no understanding of it, least by
knowing your policy, they seek means to prevent it. And this I say because
you know it is the custom when the arrows on either side be all spent, then
to store them selves with those that they receive from their enemy, and to
return them back again so long as the fight endures: Now by this device
that I have told you, you may have great advantage of your enemy. For when you
have both discharged all your arrows one against an other, their arrows being
big notched, shall serve your small stringes very well, but your small
notched arrows shall not be able to serve their great stringes, so shall you
have great plenty to assail them a fresh, and they none at all to resist you,
by this means ye may deal with them, as you list, and they shall no way be
able to escape your hands.

The king that was a very wise Prince, perceauing how profitable this council
might be unto him, caused it with all diligence to be put in execution, and
finding it to fall out to his commodity, and the confusion of his enemies, he
greatly commended Martuccio, and to show him self thankful for so great a
benefit, rewarded him very bountifully, and advanced him to great authority.

The report of this ran through out the whole country, so that at last it
came to Constance ^ares, that Martuccio Gomitto (whom she supposed to be dead
long since) was yet alive: wherefore the love that she bare unto him, which by
this time was almost quite extinct, began now to kindle a fresh with a new
flame, which increasing more and more, did quite remove from her all desire to
dye, and opening her case to the good Lady that she served, told her that she
greatly desired to go to Thunes, to satisfy her eyes with that which her ears
had heard, to thend she might be more assured of his safety, whose welfare she
wished as her own. The good Lady greatly commended her, provided a bark, and
with all speed went with her to Thunes, where at their coming they were
honorably received by a kinsman of hers that was dwelling there: where when
they were settled, she sent Chereprise (that went thither with her) to harken
after Martuccio: who vndestoode that he was alive, and in great authority,
whereof making report to the Lady, she rejoiced greatly at this good news, and
desired to be the first that should bring tidinges to Martuccio of the welfare
of his friend Constance, and of her being in the country, went one day to the
place where he lodged, and desiring to speak with him, was permitted to come
unto him, to whom she said. Senior Martuccio there is a servant of yours that
came from Lippare, arrived at my house, whose desire is to have some conference
with you, and because I would not trust any other (as she requested me) I am
come my self to do the message unto you: Martuccio thanked her and went with
her to her lodging, where she left Constance, who seeing that her dear friend
Martuccio was ravished with exceeding joy, and not able to bridle her affection
leaped suddenly about his neck, and embraced him with open arms, but the
remembrance of the passed pains, and the pleasure she conceived in her
present fortune, did so bereave her sense, that she could not utter one word,
nor reframe from shedding tears in great abundance.

Martuccio beholding her whom he so dearly loved, the case seemed so strange,
and so greatly amazed him, that he stood in doubt a great while, whether he
saw her in deed, or else dreamed that he saw her, but when he came to himself
again, and knew for certain that it was she he said unto her. Alas my dear
art thou yet alive, it is long since that I hard report that thou was lost,
neither could it be known whether thou we^test, or what was become of thee.
This said, weping bitterly he embraced and kissed her a thousand times
together. Then did Constance tell him of all her adventures, and how
courteously the good Lady had dealt with her from time to time, after which and
diverse other talk that they had together, he departed from thence, and going
to the King his Master advertised him of all that had happened to him and his
friend Constance, craving leave of him to marry her according to his country
manner: The King greatly marueling at the matter, sent for Constance, who
confirming all that Martuccio had reported, he said unto her: Now truly fair
vigin thou art worthy to have him to thy husband, for whom thou have taken
such pains and passed so many perils: wherefore bestowing many large gifts
upon them, he gave them leave to do whatsoever they thought good: Then
Martuccio very liberally rewarding the Lady for the great benevolence that she
had used toward Constance in her adversity, with the Kings license, took
leave of all his friends in that country, and with Constance and Chereprise
took ship, and returned very rich to Lippare, where they were so chearefully
received of all their friends (who never thought to have seen them again)
that it is not possible to declare the exceeding joy that this second meeting
did bring to every one of them: To conclude Martuccio and Constance (to their
great comfort and contentment) being solemnelye married, ever after duringe
the term of their life enjoyed their love together, as they ought without any
impediment or let, to their deserved pleasure.

The complaint of one in misery.
THe day seems long to them that dwell in dole,
and short the time to such as live in joy:
The sickmans grief full little knows the hole,
so much delight does differ from annoy,
That the one does cause in man desire to die,
the other still to live continually.
What man would wish to live that lives in woe?
and in delight who would desire to die?
Since that by death an end of grief does grow,
and death of joys depriues us utterly,
Of worldly joys, for only so I mean:
of which we see death does deprive us clean.
Whereby not all old proverbs true I find,
for old said sawes do say that life is sweet:
But death is more desierd of noble mind,
then life to lead for living far unmeet.
Which loathed life does make me thus to cry:
I live too long come death and let me die.
A Lover fancied, but not favored of Fortune.
MY mourning mind does crave some sweet delight,
and fancy fame would lend me some I see:
But fortune frowns, and sendes me foul despite,
and care does keep all comfort quite from me.
Such passions strange do still perplex my mind:
as I despair of any ease to find.
But let me see, I must not yet despair,
Dame fortunes wheel may happen ^ourne again:
When storms are past the weather may be fair,
and pleasure comes unlooked for after pain:
Things at the worst, the proverb says will mend,
why should not then my sorrows have an end.
But old said Sawes are not yet scripture all,
for things at worst are past all mendinge quite:
To pininge hearts all pleasure seems small,
what mirthe can do the py^ing heart delight.
When fates do frown and fortune is our foe,
^ought can be thought to rid the mind of woe.
The nature of the Lark described.
THe little Lark that in the ground is hatched,
and there bredde up till feathers make her fly:
No sooner she a flight or two has caught,
but up she mountes unto the lofty sky.
Where if she see Son shine and weather fair,
how then for joy she twittles in the air.
But if she see the wind begin to blow,
it pour down rain and tempests do arise:
Within a bush she keeps her self full low,
where pretty wretch close to the ground she lies,
Until such time as all the storms be past,
and then again she geu^th her up in have.
Which plainly shows the nature in the Lark,
is still to seek, to mount to lofty sky:
And though perhaps you now and then may mark,
a kistrell kite to make a flight so hye,
Yet all things waide if each thing have his right,
a lark will far be likde above a kite.
The hawty mind how it disposes it self.
WHat hill so hye? but little emmets clyme,
what precious perle? but pore by travel gain,
What thing so hard: but is atchiud in time,
what pleasure such? but may be got with pain,
What doubt so great but hope may men assure?
see more, what heaven? but prayer may procure.
The heavy Ass both keep the valley still,
the clownishe coultes do love the Country best*
When hawtie hearts do clime the highest hill,
and gallant minds do seek in court to rest,
The cowarde dreades and in dispairs does dye,
when boldest bloodes by hope do clime full hye.
Then let my heart go clime the highest hill,
and leave the valley for the country Ass:
My mind in court shall seek by travel still,
to find a pearl which (far) all pearls does pass.
My hope shall rest upon a princely mind.
by help of God some heavenly grace to find.
Loathing his life, he wishes for death.
WHat greater grief then torments of the heart,
which daily grow by troubles of the mind?
And what such joy as sudden ease of smart,
which long time sought, full hard has been to find?
What heaven on earth, with lucky love to dwell?
then luck^les love again what greater hell?
But how fares he that feels no delight?
what world is that? where nothing is but woe:
What woe to that? which works such despite,
as makes a man no kind of comfort know.
What life leads he* that daily cries to die*
far worse then death, lo such a life lead I,
Then let me thus conclude my tale in brief,
I am the man that only may lament
A loathsome life; that find no ease of grief,
nor hopes for help until my days be spent.
And sadly so I end my solemn song:
Come, come, good death, I dying, live too long.
Hanging between hope and despair, he calls for help.
TWixt cheerful hope, and comfortles despair,
straungely perplexed, full sore amasde I stand:
Hope seems to show the weather will be fair,
and dark despair, says tempests are at hand.
Venture says hope, despair does bid me slack:
hope pricks me on, despair does pull me back.
Have well says hope, despair does bid me doubt,
trust me says hope, despair says hope is vain:
Shrink not says hope, despair cries not to stout.
labor says hope, despair does show no gain.
Good hap says hope, despair cries contrary:
hope bids me live, despair would have me die.
Thus twixt those two, at point of death I live,
in hope of good, yet fearing froward chance:
In you it lies, a happy hap to give,
to bring me out of this despairing trance.
Oh help me then, that thus on knees do cry:
Assure my hope, or in despair I die.
The Lover craves reward, for his long and faithful service.
OH Love, to whom I long have been a slave,
consider well, how truly I have serud;
And blame not him, who is compeld to crave,
the due reward that he has well deserud.
Let trusty troth, be ever yet regarded:
that faithful servants, may be well rewarded.
Thou know how long, that I have lived a thrall,
thou know again, my true and faithful mind:
And thou can tell, how lands, limme, life, and all,
by faith full fast, I once did firmly find.
To serve a Saint, all this thou love do know:
and how my faith, I never did forgo.
And since thou know I never reapt reward,
nor ever sought til now reward to crave:
Sweet love, let now my humble suite be heard,
and pity take, upon thy silly slave.
And cause the Saint whom I so long have serud:
to lend me liking as I have deserud.
Oh amor.
WHat thing is love? a God as Poets wright,
why Poets feign, then how can that be true?
What is it then? some worldly sweet delight,
oh then, their love, why should so many rue?
It is a grief? then why are men so vain?
to joy in that, which does procure their pain.
But such a pain, as pleasure bringes withal,
and such a grief, as yealds a heavenly joy:
Does make the heart, to think the hurt but small,
when fancy rids the mind of self annoy,
And such is sure, the panges that lovers prove:
that wretched wights, can joy so much in love.
But peace, I see love is a God in deed,
who diverse ways, does work in mind of man:
Whose mighty power man's reason does exceed,
by working woe or comfort now and than.
But is it so? is love a power divine,
then God of Gods speed well this love of mine.
Naught dare I do therefore oh God of love
I thee beseech, to work for thy behooue.
Of a hauty mind.
THe conquest rare, does greatest glory gain,
the strongest fortes by stoutest wightes are won
The hardest things atchiude with greatest pain,
do breed most ease, when so the work is done.
Well labors he, how so his time be spent,
that for his pains does reap his hearts content.
God knows my heart, and what I do desire,
but what I seek does few or no man know:
The nobler heart, the higher does aspier:
and for my self I cannot stoop to low,
But if I seek to clyme a step to hye,
God save the child, for if I fall I dye.
In high attemptes, the boldest bloudes of all,
do best prevail, when peril once is past:
Then live, or dye, or stand, or slide or fall:
clyme sure I will God set my footing fast,
And help me so to height of my desire,
that I may wish, save heaven to clyme no hyer.
After many misfortunes he craves death as the ender of all calamities.
I Long in jest have wishd and calde for death,
when foolish toys have gone against my mind:
But dying now at latest gasp of breath,
I call to God that I may favor find.
That sin breed not my souls eternal pain,
that dyinge here I may not dye again,
For now I see the woes of wretched will,
and now I find the filthy shame of sin:
And now by grace I know the good from ill,
I loathe the state that I have lived in*
I see the life of man is but a flower,
which springes, grows, fades, and dies in an hour.
What are we all but even a clod of claye,
first made of earth whence back again we must:
A life unsure which lasts not a day:
A death most sure to which each one may trust.
And yet that death yeldes life by heavenly grace,
which grace God grant each one in wretched case.
And for my self God me my sins forgive,
and God forgive each one that is amiss:
Our sins forgive, God grant our souls may live,
From wretched world with him in heavenly bliss.
And thus I end my solemn dyinge song,
Lord save my soul I dyinge live too long.
He proves virtue to be better, then worldly riches.
THe gold that first within the ground does grow,
does come to stand on top of pillars hye:
The precious Pearl that likewise lies full low,
the Prince accountes a jewel for his eye,
What iemme so rare that ever yet was found,
but that at first did grow out of the ground.
Then when you see your palace trimly decked,
straight call to mind from whence that decking came:
And to the ground have presently respect,
who by Gods help did first bring forth the same.
And think the iemme, that makes the brauest show:
full rough at first, within the ground did grow.
The man whose mind is full and wholly bent,
to virtues throne to tread the ready way:
And meets mishap, ere half his journey spent,
to loathsome vice to lead him out astray.
Where is the fault, but in a froward will:
who goes without the guide of wisdoms skill.
But what if wit be ruled by sage advise,
and then do chance to meet with naked need:
It boots alas, but little to be wise,
if wealth do want, to help to do the deed.
Yet wealthy wise, who walks to virtues school:
when he comes there, shall see himself a fool.
How should the mind, then seek out virtues throne,
or else what mind, is best to seek the same:
The seat is strange, and stands all alone,
and virtue she, is thought a heavenly dame.
Which makes me think, it is some heavenly place:
which heavenly mind, must game by heavenly grace.
Which heavenly guide, God grant my willing mind,
with wisdoms skill, to seek out virtues school:
That though wealth want, yet wit may wisely find.
how long, too long, that I have lived a fool.
And I may see from virtues heavenly way:
what wanton toys have led my mind astray.
The lover being overcome, is compelled of necessity ^o sing of sorrow.
Feign would I write some pretty pleasant toy
to put away fond fancies out of mind,
But secret spite so chokes me with annoy,
as wearied wits can little pleasure find,
So that I see if ought at all I write
my song must be of sorrow and despite.
And sorrows song, who would desire to sing
that doleful dumpe does lend but small delight,
And yet the mind which wretched woes do wring
can sing no song but smackes of some despite,
For if of mirth it does the more disease
and solemn songs do little pain appease:
Then sad and sweet since that no song I see
which may delight of cheer the heavy heart,
I can but ^igh let others sing for me,
no music mirth can ease my secret smart,
Therefore I deem as I at first begone
I would be merry, but my mirth is done.
The lover by froward hap enforced to forsake love, enforces him self by
travel to seek out the forte of fame.
THe world is chaungd, my wits are woond about,
fancy is forced to leave her fond desire,
From vain delites dame Virtue drives me out,
and wisdom will what reason does require.
My wanton wits are warnd by sacred I kill
to fly the follies of (...) will.
I now must leave to write of lovers toys
in Cupids Court I must no longer keep,
Nor sport my self in wanton pleasures lays,
nor longer lie in fancies lap a sleep
I now must wake and set my self to school,
to see how long that I have lyude a fool.
And I must now some time in travel spend,
to seek in time the gallant forte of fame.
That when (alas) my lothed life does end,
my works may leave remembrance of my name.
And I may show though long I went astraye,
I found at last dame virtues heavenly way.
The lover forsaken craves speedy death.
A Wretched case it is to sit and cry,
where none are near to help the harmed heart:
A greater grief where present aid is nigh,
and yet by spyghte is only kept a part.
But yet most grief, when help is hard at call,
and yet (alas) can do no good at all.
In such a case lo cursed wretch I stand,
my heavy heart full sore for comfort cries:
Yet none can get, yet some is hard at hand,
which in despighte accursed hap denies.
And some I have, which would somewhat content,
but does in deed my sorrows more augment.
The secreat cause alas for shame I hide,
since folly first was worker of my woe:
By want of wit, which wisdom has discride:
and I do now by secreate sorrow show.
Therefore consumde, come kill me death I cry,
in deed resolud, and well content to dye.
A Comparison between thraldom, and liberty.
THe little bird that close in kage is pente,
which ladies love to sit and whistle by:
Some say does singe but lays of deep lament,
and cheareles chirpes for loss of liberty,
Esteeming more her mates abroad in field,
then courtly toys that chiefest pleasure yield.
But contrary, oh happy bird think I,
so luckely to light in fowlers snare:
As to be brought to stand in pallas hye,
and eke in court to feed on princely fare.
And shortly there in favor so to stand.
as to be fed at fairest ladies hand.
Would God I were a bird in prison pent,
so I might still behold my heavenly Queen:
If that I sing one note of deep lament:
that day when I my Princes grace have seen,
Wring of my neck, or fling me out of door,
as worthy then to keep in court no more.
A warning to all estates.
The gallant mind, when store of coin is spent,
by rare exploytes, must seek to purchase praise.
Though honor fall to some by due descent,
good hap does hit a thousand sundry ways,
Yet oftentimes in seeking high renown,
the hautie heart, hard Fortune flingeth down.
The soldier thinks by sword to win his wish,
when often is seen the sword does cut him short.
The sea man seeks in deepest floods to fish,
when drowning proves a cold unpleasant sport.
The merchant means to win the world by wares,
when often his cost does yield him naught but cares.
Now some again build castles in the air,
which many times fall tumbling on their necks,
And some will seem to sit in stately chair,
which are sometime set down with deadly checkes.
In s^^e I find the brauest mind o^ all
is highest set, but hand before a fall.
The misery of love.
BEwrapt in woe, (...) with wretched will,
overcome with ^ares, deep drenched in distress,
Pining in pain, alive, but dying still,
crying for help, but finding no redress.
A life I lead the Lord of heaven does know,
much worse then death to mourn in sorrow so.
But what auailes when fates and fortune froune,
when moon and stars are now become my foes,
When from delight, despite does keep me down,
and cares my corpse do round about enclose.
Abide I must as destinies ordain,
thus like a wretch to (...) away in pain,
Or loathed life that wretched thus I lead,
ten times (...) such cursed hap to know,
Or cruel (...) come cut a two the thread
that draws forth my days in sorrow so,
Oh sorrow (...) thy soking sighs dospill me,
all dole adieu come you good death and kill me.
Or else good God who from above do see
the secret cause of all my cutting care,
And knows and have what thing will comfort me
vouchsafe some drop of mercy me to spare,
That so my heart, that long has bid in grief,
may praise thy name for tending my relief.
In wanton youth, my fancy thought a while,
there was no state nor life so sweet as love,
But now I find how well did wit beguile,
and I the pain of such a pleasure prove,
I needs must say by true experience taught,
I find in deed the state of love stark naught.
For first the wise, love makes become a fool,
the soldier stout, the rich not worth a grote,
The learned clarke, it sets again to school
to learn an art wherewith to cut his throat.
It makes the man most free become a slave,
and many times an honest man a knave.
The Lord of love Cupid him self is blind,
yet shootes by ame and often unhappily hits.
He hurts the heart, and quite does dim the mind,
and with vile ways does ouerwhealme the wits?
What shall I say, who knew so much as I
would deem of love a woeful misery.
A mean is best.
WHen I sometime with grief enough beheld
the gallant troop of brauenes in their kind
Some swime in silk, some silver pearl and gold,
and I poor soul come meanly clad behind.
Good Lord I think what kind of world is this
when some so thrive, some fare so far amiss.
But when again I see some lusty lad
whom I my self have known in mean estate,
And in respect, but silly simple swads,
and none to keep so high and stately gate.
Well, yet think I, this will not ever last:
the tides do flow, but ebb again as fast.
The proverb says, that pride will have a fall,
who has no lands, nor yet no rents, I see
When money melts, and feathers gin to fall,
will be full glad, to come and follow me.
Lo this is all, the sudden joy I have:
when richly clad I see a rascal knave,
An other.
FRom leathed bed, my lustles limbs I lift,
with heavy heart, with sorrow, not with sleep:
But sigh and sobbe, I see no other shift,
such careful thoughts, my mind in thraldom keeps,
No Musickes mirth, nor any sweet delight:
may once revive my over dulled spright.
Yet can I sing: and how? but as the swan:
a doleful dumpe, when death is hard at hand:
And so perhaps, poor wretch, I think I can,
sing such a note, as none shall understand.
Which song perhaps, shall please but few that hear:
and my poor heart (God knows) as little cheer.
Then since you see my heart so ill at ease,
leave of to crave a Christmas song of me:
My doleful dumpe, were liker to displease
each one I fear, then please but one of ye.
But if some one would sit him down and cry:
with sorrows, sobs, so, but for shame would I.
The lover wearied, craves ease.
THough wearyed long, yet home I come at last,
and down I sit, in sorrows sorry seat:
Dark dole draws on, delightful day is past,
and fancy fair, must be my chiefest meat.
I broake my fast, with dishes of despite:
and now must suppe, with sorrows soppes at night.
In coldest frostes, my fire is furies flame,
in whoatest heat, my cooling card is care:
My pleasure pain, which fates and fortune frame,
my music moan, to think how hard I fare.
My compame, a train of treachery:
my loathed lodge, a den of misery.
In such a house, what wretch would lay his head?
from faithles friends, who would not seek to fly?
Who pines in pain, were ten times better dead,
such life lead I, which makes me thus to cry.
Ah woeful wretch, whose heart so sore accursed:
with swelling sobbes, is hourly like to burst.
The arraignement of a Lover,
THe wretched wight, that wears away in woe.
who draws his days, in dumps of dire despite
Whom care consumes, but does no comfort know,
who dying lives, deuoyde of all delight.
Let him with me come sing this sorrows song:
the loathed life alas, does last too long.
In prime of years, first grew my deadly grief,
and as my years, my corzies do increase:
Rigor retains, the means of my relief,
and spite still swears, my sorrows shall not cease.
Envy so works, with sleights of false suspect:
that witles rage, does reason quite reject.
Pride looks alofte, and pity shrinkes aside,
and dare not speak, hate is so hard at hand:
Disdain, desert, has due reward denide,
and will, will let no case be rightly scand.
Lo thus I live, in danger of distress:
and right it self, can get me no redress.
The cause at first of all this care, was love,
who clapped me close, in fancies fetters fast:
And so inforcd, a captives life to prove,
in prison pent, my prime of years are past,
And yet can make no means to set me free:
till death him self, do make an end of me.
At beauties bar, I twice have been arrained,
and craft has there, been my accursed still:
Foul hate was hard, and reason was restraind.
and wicked wrong, had leave to say his will,
A forged tale of false suspect, was troth:
and troth it self, was thought a trifling oath.
In judgment seat, by beauty sat disdain,
before her lap, sat Cupid God of love.
Self will sat next, and treason with his train,
was witness called, my foul offense to prove.
My cause, the Quest was panneld there to try:
who me co^demnd (God knows) without cause why.
But beauty yet, her judgment would not give,
for why? (quoth she) the man may yet amend:
His years are young, and he in time may live
to do them good, that him do favor lend.
Yea (quoth disdain) dame beauty will ye so,
tush let him trudge, quoth Courtesy not so.
Quoth Pride alas, it is a ^illy slave,
what should he do? twere good for him to die*
(Quoth Pity) then let poor souls favor have,
at least, extremity, proves open injury.
(Quoth Cruelty) twere ill that he should live:
(quoth Reason) then I will the man repriue.
Being ouerwearyed with misfortunes, he craves death.
MY weary wit, quite ouerwor^e with woe,
my dulled brain, bewitched with wretched will*
By certain signs, do daily seem to show,
that care in fine, my silly corpse will kill.
Though hope a while, my loathed life prolong:
sorrow at last, will singe the Signets song.
For though sometime, I do dissemble dole,
and Swanlike singe a song of sweet delight:
Yet God he knows, my heart is far from hole,
which pining pants, with pangs of bitter spite.
The cause I singe, is hope that death is me:
the song I sing, is death come let me die.
This deadly song, in dole is my delight,
and mournful mirth, to cheer a careful mind:
Yet such sad sport, sometimes in deepest spite,
is all the joy, that fortune lets me find.
Yet thus content, with patience perforce:
I singe, I die, come bear away my corse.
The Lovers tongue tied, for being over-(...).
I May not speak, yet speak I must perforce;
what boo^es to speak? you will not understand:
I must confess in deed, my voice is hoarce,
yet if my words were well and wisely skand,
Then would you say, the man whose tongue is tied:
must have his mind, by mysteries discried.
So for my self, since I have silence sworn,
til I have leave at large to say my mind:
Plain speech, alas, must be of force forborne,
until to speak, I do (...) ^auour find.
But had I leave to speak without offense,
then would (I say she lies not long way hence.)
This is one mean, whereby to know my mind,
the second is, I rue her careful case:
The third (sweet soul) she is of nature kind,
the fourth, she is of favor like your face.
The fifte, she is a fair and courteous dame:
the sixte and last, she bears our Ladies name.
She is besides, the only Saint I serve,
she is the sweet, whom I do most esteem:
She is the dame, whom I do most deserve,
yea it is she, whom I most dear do deem.
And thus I end, I say no more but this,
I cannot speak, judge what my meaning is.
Another.
I May not speak, yet silence works my woe,
my speech I have, and yet I cannot speak:
My tied tongue, does tumble too and fro,
my will would feign, but wits are all too weak.
My heart does heave my tongue to tell my mind:
yet to my speech, a sudden stop I find.
Yet, had I leave, to say but what I would,
then would I (...) wits unto my will:
My tied tongue should tell you as it could,
the thing that yet, I must keep silent still.
My heart would break, but it by signs should show:
that which by speech, I may not let you know.
Then speak (...) first, and so my speech release,
crave what I may my words shall grant your will:
Speak you, hear me, but if you hold your peace,
my tied tongue, must needs be silent still.
And thus I end, my heart is like to break
with grief* remitte your will to let me speak.
Say you but this, my words shall like your will,
and you shall hear the (...) of my heart:
And if my wits do want such cunning skill,
as well may painte my panges in every part,
Yet by my words, guess thou my inward grie^e:
and by thy will grant me some sweet relie^e.
He craves by virtue, and not by subtlety, to come to good fortune.
WHat means this world? is nothing left but woe?
are words but wind? is faith the court^^y fled?
Can flattery seek to creep in credit so?
is virtue gone? and all good dealing dead?
Then let me seek* to do as others do:
by subtle sleights, to creep in credit too.
What have I said? shall I by subtle ^leight
seek credit? no, my heart such dealing hates:
My troth has vowed, for to detest deceit,
such means are best, for such ill meaning mates
As credit seek, unto so vile an end:
as wisdom finds, a foe of such a friend.
And for my self, since that I know indeed,
that virtue gains the greatest good that is:
Although with some, it stand in little stead,
yet with the best, it thryueth not amiss.
I crave of God, though here my hap be hard:
by virtue I, in heaven may have reward.
Love good and badde.
Strange were the life, that every man would leeke,
more strange the state that should mislike each one
Rare were the iemme, that every one would seek,
and little worth, that all would let alone.
Sweet were the meat, that every one would choose:
and sour the sauce, that all men would refuse.
Yet such a life, and such a state there is,
such iemme, such joy, such meat, such sauce, and all:
And if I do not take my marks amiss,
by but one word, I could descry them all.
Which only word, that shows them all by name:
is this word (Love) that plainly shows the same.
Who would not wish to lead his life in love?
and who so mad, to seek to live in woe?
Yet he that means, the joys of love to prove,
is like perforce, most bitter panges to know.
In love such woes, with joys are ioynde together:
take the one, take both, or leave both, chose you whether.
Love right is rare, and worthy to be sought,
but counterfaite, is but a foolish toy:
Whose virtues rare, as rare effects have wrought,
and which mista^e, has wrought as great annoy.
But right so rare, and hard is to be known:
as who would seek, were better let alone.
Fond fancies fruits, are all the soode of love,
whose sause most sour, is sorrows sugared gall:
Which mess of meat, does in disgestion prove,
to yield both mind and body, comfort small.
Yet see the spite, who of the fruit would eat:
must suppe the sauce, or let alone the meat.
Another.
Eh cruel care, that calls to mind in vain,
the thriftles time, that reachles youth has spent:
Had thou but waighd, in pleasures past the pain,
that present now, I do too late repent,
Then had thou sau'de me, from such sorrows smart:
as now I see, do so consume my heart.
But since at first, thou letst me slip at large,
to follow will, the worker of my woe:
Too late (alas) thou takst me now in charge,
with secreat sorrows to consume me so.
Then leave me, Care, or quickly lend me cure:
least loathed life, no longer do endure.
What say thou Care? or can thou make no way,
to win the good, that wanton will has lost:
Oh then good death, do thou no more delay,
to kill me, thus with careful troubles tossed.
But must I live? then God who knows my grief:
cut of my cares, and lend me some relief.
Long have I walked, to tire my restles mind,
yet tired am long since, with weary woes:
And yet (though tierd) no resting place can find,
where I might once my restles mind repose:
But tired thus, on, on, must travail still:
till want of rest, my wearyed carkas kill.
Ah wretched walk, that has such weary end,
which end though long, would I could find it yet:
But fates do frown, fortune is not my friend,
and wretched woes have ouerworne my wit.
So that in vain I seek, I see in fine:
to set at rest, this wearye mind of mine.
I sought for love, but found out foul despite,
(a way that was quite wide from that, I sought:)
But since (alas) I followed folly quight,
and left the way, that trusty reason taught,
In weary ways, I now must wander still:
to see the sorrows of my wretched will.
But Ladies ye, that lead your lives at ease,
and are not forcd, to tread one step awry:
Nor pass one foot, more then may pleasure please,
with ruth respect, my woeful treachery.
And when you fall into your tyring talk:
with pity weigh, poor Bretons weary walk.
Another.
It Is strange, Madame, to see you strange,
that stood so much on terms of truth:
From which so soon to see you change,
does show in you a trick of youth.
A trick of youth to take a toy,
to take a toy and turn away:
And turn away from your sweet joy,
from your sweet joy, that would not stray.
From whom you once could say and swear,
not death it self should make you start:
But since you lickt and likd else where,
your vowed oath is laid a part.
And let it lie a part for me,
for I my self have vowed too:
To fly as far, as fast from thee,
as thou from me can think to do.
And so shall either be content,
thou have thy wish, and I my will:
Whereof who first seems to repent,
let them bite on the bridle still.
Another.
It Is lust that leads your love awry,
it is change that makes you check your choice:
It Is fancy makes your faith to fly,
it is folly makes you false your voice.
But reckon what you get thereby:
And put your winnings in your eye.
It Is wanton words that winnes your will,
it is wavering wit that makes you trippe:
It Is double dealing draws you still,
it is sorry meaning makes you slip.
But reckon what you get thereby:
and put your winnings in your eye.
For lust with loathing once will reaue,
and change perchance your choice will choke:
Fond fancy often her fall does weaue,
that puts on folly for her cloak.
But reckon what you gain thereby:
and put your winninges in your eye.
When wanton words are tournd to wind,
and wavering wit, has wrought your woe,
Then dooble dealinge you shall find
and sorry meaning both your foe:
And counting then your gain thereby,
you may put winninges in your eye.
The fruits of ielousy.
DAme Procris, and Don Cephalus, old Ovid tells the tale
were lincked fast in loyal love, as married man and wife,
And blisfully they lead their lives, deuoyde of any bale,
till Ielousy threw in a boane, the root of all their strife.
He gave the first occasion, and subtillie he sought,
disfigured to prove her truth, corrupting her with gold:
To vnderminde her chastity, this ^aight her love has cought,
for where the battery is so hot, weak women cannot hold.
He blames her inconstancy, she blusheth at her fall,
and for to shrowde her self fro shame, she frames her self to flight:
Thus banished, she bides abroad, til weried therwithal,
he called her home, and reconciled, he does forgive her quight.
In proof of this atonement made, on him she does bestow,
a dog, a darte, of sundry sort, excelling in their kind:
The dog he mist no chase in hunt, the darte it mist no blow,
a man might seek the world for such, yet not their matches find
In concord thus continuing, Don Cephalus does use:
to haunt the field with more delight, then ever he was wont:
Dame Procris she that marked it well, begins now to muse,
and thinks it but unlawful game, her husband went to hu^t.
See, see the fruits of ielosie, see on what ground they grow,
on no soil else I warrante you, but such as hat^ a stain:
Silde seeks the Sire his son in oven, but that he first did know
himself full often to have been there, this case is too too plain.
Upon a sweet smile.
Sweet are the smiles, in secreat I receive,
and secreat sweet, is sweetest sweet of all:
Would God (sweet wench) thou plainly did perceive,
how by thy smiles, I live deuoyd of thrall.
Then (my sweet soul) I know to my delight:
thou still would use, sweet smiling in my sight.
For if sweet hope, yeald me such sweetness still,
my fancy sweet, for food will never sterue:
I can but yeald sweet thanks for sweet good will,
and sweetly seek, such sweetness to deserve.
And could my wish, once win my sweet desire,
soon should I reap, the sweet I would require.
Which sweet request, is to thy sweet content,
by thy sweet will, to work my sweetest wish:
Which wish so sweet, my sweet so sweetly meant,
is by sweet bait, to catch so sweet a fish,
Which bait so sweet, is love I lay for thee,
and thou the fish, I seek to draw to me.
Which sweetly let thy fancy feed upon,
and thou shall find so sweet a kind of baight:
as by my hook of hope, I think anon,
to draw thee up, by lines of sweet delight.
And thus (my sweet) I sweetly angle still:
till my sweet love, has caught thy sweet good will.
An inuectiue against love.
WIth ue, that see my loyal heart:
grant my desire, enjoy his due desarte.
That all the world, may well be warnd by me,
to shun such mischieues, as themselves may see.
Let Poets feign and tell what tales they list,
the troth is this, love grows in deed of lust
First look, then prate, and so forsooth they kissed,
and then you know what further follow must.
Which to obtain, yet better be without,
how wits must work to bring this gear about.
Love is in deed a natural instinct,
which first does grow but by view of the eye,
Which moves desire to pass beyond precinct,
and so does breed a secreate malady.
So love is then a natural disease
and does in deed to nature little ease.
The law of love instruckes no more but this,
truly to serve the lady whom we love:
To prove each mean to please a misteris,
whom every toy may to displeasure move.
It is I find a flatteringe kind of art,
which with deceit will fraught the truest heart.
And if it be as learned fathers find,
it is a fire that does consume the heart:
A welcome wound unto the wanton mind,
a pleasant poison breeding deadly smarte.
And if in love be such a state to prove:
happy is he that never falls in love.
And for my self I solemnly protest
See, see the fruits of ielosie, see on what groun^ (...)
on no soil else I warrante you, but such as has (...)
Silde seeks the Sire his son in oven, but that he first did know
himself full often to have been there, this case is too too plain.
Which since I do by true experience prove,
I hate the nature, state, and law of love.
He craves speedy love, or speedy death.
OH care leave of to tire my restles mind,
come comfort, come, revive my dulled spright:
Fly fancy, fly, or else some favor find,
cease sorrow, cease, love lend me some delight.
Auaunte despair, oh help me hope in haste,
hap help my hope, least life no longer last.
Draw near delight, cheer up my heavy heart,
pack from me pain, away vile wretched woe:
Sweet heavenly joy, come help my secreate smarte,
oh ruthe relieve the wretch that sorrows so.
Grief get thee gone, let pleasure take thy place:
hence ugly death, for I must live a space.
Mistres dear, dame sweet, sovereign, my joy,
the Saint I serve, the comfort of my care:
My hope, my healpe, my mirth in all annoy,
my love, my life, my joy of joys that are.
Oh save my life, that thus on thee do cry:
lend me thy love, or let me quickly die.
My faith has vowde to foil all false suspecte,
and will will work in spite of enuies face:
Trothe is the oath which I cannot neglecte,
that love should find to gain his ladies grace.
Oh Gods of love, that see my loyal heart:
grant my desire, enjoy his due desarte.
He being tormented with many passions, craves speedy remedy.
WHether will wit? or what? is reason fled?
what wretched will has now bewitchd my brain
What rechlesse rage keeps reags within my head?
what frantike fit, has vexd me in each vain.
What mad conceit, does thus my mind molest?
that tumbling thoughts, will never let me rest.
Work no more wit, till reason rule thy will,
by sage advise, to stay thy busy brain:
Suppress thy rage, by sacred wisdoms skill,
and frantike fits will fly away again.
Let madness march, into some other mind:
and seek thy self, some quiet rest to find.
For living thus, thy wit does work thee woe,
and brain bewitchd, does breed thee wilful bale:
And rueful rage, in time will rancor so,
that will cannot, give ear to wisoomes tale.
Therefore (good will) let wit in time take heed:
least reason lost, thou run stark mad indeed.
Yet sit not still, for idleness is ill,
but call to God, to grant thee heavenly grace:
That willing wit, may work his heavenly will,
and troubled mind, may find a heavenly place.
About this work, go beat thy busy brain:
both rest on earth, and heavenly joys to gain.
That wight is bewitched, that is subject to beauty.
THe grief is great, that never finds redress,
hard is his hap, that finds no happy hour:
Doleful his doom, that dies in distress,
bewitchd the will, that waits on beauties bower.
Wretched his woes, that is bewrapt in love:
such grief hap, doom, and wretched state I prove.
For fancy now, has reason put to flight,
and witles will, does wisdoms words disdain:
Desire, acquaints him self with fond delight,
and running wit, has got a wanton vain.
Self will has sought, sage wisdom to beguile:
and has in deed, deceaud himself the while.
For fancies gain, is loss, unto my grief,
and reason fled, what rechles race I run:
My deep distress, dispayring in relief,
does tell me plain, my pleasant days are done.
My foul despite, does show my mourning mind:
the bitter fruits, of fond delight I find.
Repentance rues sage wisdoms small regard,
and wretched woes, do wanton toys bewail:
And heavy heart, lamenteth hap so hard,
and sorrow shows, that self wills sleights do fail,
Which makes me sing, unto my dying hour:
bewitchd is he, that waytes on beauties bower.
Seek, and find.
THe proverb says, who seeks shall surely find,
shall find? but what? not that he seeks I guess*
For why? my self have sought in sundry kind,
unto my grief, to find some sweet redress.
And sure I find, but what? for sweet delight:
the bitter fruits of broyle and dire despite.
Then, who seeks so, were better not to seek,
or if he seek, were better lose then find:
For he that finds unto his most misleeke,
will where he finds, his burden leave behind.
And stand content, with labor spent in vain:
rather then bear it to his further pain.
Yet he that seeks to find out sweet delight,
and seeking, seeks the surest way he may,
It Is ten to one, but he shall meet despite*
which if he find, he needs must bear away,
Or else despite will drive him too and fro:
from all delight into a world of woe.
So that which way so ere he go to work,
to find the way that leads unto delight:
Such envious hagges shall find in secreate lurk:
as still will seek to drive him on despite.
Yet what of this? in spite of all despite:
my mind shall seek to find out my delight.
The lover argues between delight, and despite.
WHen joys do fade, and all delight decays,
and pinching pain, possesses pleasures place:
And wretched woe, in weary woeful ways,
draws forth the life, in grief and great disgrace.
Who then can choose, but in his heart to cry?
adue delight, I must in sorrow die.
Adue deligh* oh what a doleful song?
why solemn songs serve best for silly souls:
Then why shrink I? who dying, live too long,
and daily hear the howerly careful knowles.
The bell of bale ringes out both day and night:
to bid me die, and bid adue delight.
Yet minds will mourn, when mirth is changd to ^^ne,
and hearts will yearne to bid delight adue:
The sowrest life, seems sweet til latest groan,
many repent, and yet repentance rue.
The fancy likes, that breeds the hearts despite:
which makes me singe, adue to all delight.
And yet God knows, it is a sighing song,
and such a song as greeues me sore to sing:
But since my Lute is lost, I played on long,
and sorrow is my only Musickes string.
Which runs between the frets of foul despite:
I am content to sing adue delight.
Oh miseri amanti.
WHat greater woe can be then want of wish?
and what such joy as to attain the same?
A sour sauce, does mar the daintiest dish*
no greater grief, then that which grows in game.
What spite to that, which pleasant sport procures:
what sorrow such, as man in mirth indures.
This want of wish, which works deadly woe,
and being gainde does breed as great a joy:
This sour sauce, that marreth sweet meat so,
this grief in game, this pleasure with annoy.
This spiteful sport, and mourneful (...) to prove:
is but to lead a luckles life in love.
For see, the joys are woes of lovers wish,
whose gain yealds loss, whose want breeds wailful woe:
Whose sauce is sorrow, to his daintiest dish,
whose grief in game, is doubt in yea or (...).
Whose spite in sport, is joy amiss conceiud:
whose mirth in moan, is death, the mind deceiud.
Oh (...) wish which each way works woe,
oh luckles love, which yeldes such sower sweet
oh froward fates, that first ordained so,
that moan with mirth should match so far unmeet:
Oh wretch, aid me that thus am forced to prove,
the grievous joys, by luckles lottes of love.
A Farewell to Fancy.
FAncy farewell my doting days are done,
my years are young but wit is waxen old
Reason says now my retchlesse rafe is run,
and wisdom has my wanton will controld:
And tells me plain that pleasures fruits are pain
and worldly things are all and some but vain.
Kingdoms breed cares, and treasure is but trashe
beauty bides not and favor fades away.
Friendship breeds foes, love leaves in the lash
the fairest looks when liking does decay
Biting breeds lust, lust loss, loss little ease
small ease, great grief, great grief no small disease.
Disease breeds dole, dole breeds doleful care,
care does consume, consumption day by day
Does feed on flesh, till bones be left so bare,
that loathed life, must have his dying day.
And worldly death, breeds life in heaven on hie:
to which good life, God grant that I may die.
The Lover being kaught, craves comfort.
Sweet soul, or Saint, I know not which to say,
whose heavenly power, or heavenly heart at least*
With only sight my senses does dismay,
as mind amasde, can take no hour of rest,
To thee alas, unknown, this suite I move:
comfort thy slave, whom thou have caught in love.
What have I said? alas, by only sight,
and have thy looks then linckt my heart in love?
Yea in thy looks, I see such sweet delight,
as to desire, diuinest minds may move.
Therefore thus cought, with only look I say:
a look I love, and more too as I may.
But since that may, rests only in thy will,
by looks to show, my granted leave to live,
Let me enjoy, such looks of liking still,
that I may vow, my mind shall never move.
But look and like, and love that only look:
on which to look, such sweet delight I took.
And thus I live, in hope to see the look,
that by delight, may bid me seek to serve:
Nor do I care, what toil I undertook,
by thy command thy liking to deserve.
So humbly thus, this earnest suite I move,
do bid me serve, where I am bound to love.
The Lover craves either speedy release, or else speedy death.
Driven by desire, to seek out sweet delight,
I fast am caught in dungeon of distress:
Where cloase clapped up, I lie in such despite,
as reason shows no way to seek redress.
But captive like, to sit alone and cry,
adue delight, I must in sorrow die.
Too true I find, who follows on his eye,
is sildome sure the high way right to hitte:
For many toys, do lead the mind awrie,
except that will, be guyded on by wit.
For mistes do fall, to dim the clearest eyne,
so fell a fogge before these eyes of mine.
I saw a dame, which did mine eye delight,
but secreat hurt of love I could not see:
For why? her state was set on such a hight,
as oh, I find no clyming up for me.
So to delight in love, I sought the way:
in whose despite, I find mine own decay.
Yet farewell sweet, the cause of all my care,
I blame not thee, mine eye did work my woe,
But since that love lendes such unhappy share,
the kindest heart, to kill with sorrow so,
I am content, in this distress to lie:
til love release, or death will let me die.
A Lover voweth constancy to his Lady.
IN little chestes the greatest jewels lie,
and smallest heads, are thought of greatest wit:
Clearest the sight, that can by view of eye
discern the mark, that hardest is to hitte.
And happy he, that bears his hand so right:
as (having seen) is sure to hit the whight.
Your chest I find, the careful casket is,
where now does rest the iemme of chief account:
Your sight of sense, has found by sure advice,
the heavenly wight upon Dianas mount,
And you by hap, have surely hit the mark,
that how to find, may maze a cunning Clarke.
But who could keep the key of such a chest,
or had a head, might join with such a wit,
Or could discern, where his desire does rest,
as heart does wish with happy hand to hit.
His hap were such, as I can never crave,
but wish of God, my haples heart might have.
So (pretty soul) a solemn vow I swear,
I would not seek for iemmes of greater joy,
Nor should mine eye, be trouling here and there,
to make a mark of any tysing toy.
But where I once my leauel lay of love,
my hand shall hold, and heart shall never move.
The Lover forsaken, and almost dismaide, yet through hope takes comfort.
FLy fancy, fly, and let me love no more,
what means my will? or are my wits bestraught?
Die sweet desire, molest me not so sore,
but seek to save, that thou in vain have sought:
For sorrow shows, the woe of wretched will,
and force affirms, but froward fortune still.
Where least I like, my love has lent me loss,
where most I love, my liking finds lack:
What boots my bark in waves of woe to toss?
when sorrows sands, do threaten sore shipwreck,
Such storms of strife, so rife in every coast
as (but great hap) show life and labor lost.
Yet (cowarde wretch) will thou go back again?
and keep thy couch, and leave to seek delight?
Make sure accounte, no pleasure without pain,
the sweetest joys, are gainde through sore despite.
Then get thee forth, in hope go hoyse up sail:
the wind may turn, and work for thine avail.
Let hardy hope, daunte fearful fond despair,
prepare thy self to lead a souldiars life:
Through thick and thin, by weather foul or fair,
pass through the pikes, and dread no deadly strife.
And though long first, yet when the worst is past:
the best will yealde, some wished joys at last.
Another.
I Shrink to speak, since yet I have no leave,
and yet my heart, so heaues my tongue to speak,
As that in deed, I plainly do perceive,
with force of fame, my very heart stringes break.
Which force must be, with favor ouerprest,
or else my heart, will never sit at rest.
Forgive me wretch, if that my words offend,
fancy has forcde, my silly mind to sue:
Some lyking, let good nature to me send,
my mind has sworn, our Lady service due.
Then if thou love our Lady, or her name:
regard my suite, grant favor to the same,
Which favor (lo) I only crave, is this,
to grant me leave, to say but what I could:
Say but my words, thou will not like amiss,
and thou shall hear my meaning, what I would.
But til that time, as I have said before
I must be dumb, and die in dole therefore.
The lover in sorrow craves death.
HOw might I do, to weep and wayle my fill,
that doleful dumpes, might soon dispatch my days,
Since sorrow seeks, my carkas so to kill,
oh doleful doom, that so my death delays,
I see, selfewil has wrought me such distress,
as reason shows no hope to find redress.
Yet die I must, I feel deaths deadly stroke,
my carkase eke, is nie consumde with care:
Why live I then? since that my heart is broke,
but living thus, like one half dead I fare.
Which makes me thus at point of death to cry:
strike home thy darte, good death, and let me die.
Patience prolonges the patient in pain,
comfort relieues, but rids not sorrow quight:
Hope lingers forth, a loathed life in vain,
fortune is false, and friends no wretched wight,
The fates do groan, dole is my destiny:
why live I then? good death come let me die.
Hard to find a faithful friend.
HE seeks unsure, that seeks to find a friend,
for faith is fled, and friends are secret foes:
A show of trothe, tryes treason in the end,
and many pluck a canker for a rose.
This wretched world, is full of wicked wiles:
when simple geese, the subtle fox beguiles.
For stinging snakes, lie hid in smoothest grass,
and softest stream, does show the deepest flood:
No closer craft, then in the glosing glass,
which flatters much, and shows no perfect good.
I find in deed, no greater subtlety:
then covered is with smoothe simplicity.
Then deem I best, each where to doubt the worst,
to make account of each thing by desarte:
Or ere I choose, to make true trial first,
by trial then, for to esteem in heart.
Thus think I best, such trusty friends to find:
as may content each faithful meaning mind.
He craves content, being ouerworne with Love.
OH Love, leave of to vex thy silly slave,
to bide the broyle, some fresher souldyer seek:
Thus worn with woes, some comfort let me ahue,
that so thou may, my service better leeke.
For if that care do quite my carcass kill:
how should I live, to do thee service still.
Behold my face, my flesh is fallen away,
see how mine eyes sink hollow in my head:
My dumpes declares, how my delights decay,
deem if I seem more like alive or dead.
Let lyking love, some comfort me procure:
least loathed life, no longer do endure.
Oh hear me Love, and lend me help in have,
the time is come that I must live or die:
Stay not too long, least all too late at last,
in vain (alas) thou lend me remedy.
I humbly crave, my humble suite regard,
grant my desire may have his due reward.
De contemptu mundi,
IN deep despite of this vile world I write,
what is it? but a vale of misery:
A cave of care, a dongeon of despite,
a place of pain, a pen of penury,
A sea of sorrows, and a goulph of grief,
where wretched hearts do die without relief.
The wise man wrytes it is a poisoned baight,
which does with toys, the godly mind infecte:
A wanton these, which cloasly lies in weight,
to rob the mind of every good effect.
It is a ground, where only griefs do groe:
and to conclude, a wilderness of woe.
Now, why my self so ill thereof should deem
some men may muse, that see my youthful years:
Oh soft a while, though young of years I seem,
my youth has past through many aged briars,
But now that I am yet beyond the bushes,
I do not care for all the world two rushes,
Save that my Prince I honor, I protest,
my Parents eke, and so I love my friend:
Set these aside, and as for all the rest,
of love and liking I must make an end.
I hate the world, and all the toys therein:
and long to see my joys in heaven begin.
Maledisant Beuchampe.
THe tender budde, that bravely ginnes to blow,
while summer showers yeeldes comfort to the root:
If that unawares, there fall a sudden snow,
no sun can shine, that well may do it boot,
Except it hold but for a day, and so
It may have leave to make a lively show.
My self the slower, that flourisht all too fast,
while favor flonge fair weather in my face,
But now must die, my pleasures ouerpast,
to see disdain, so drive me in disgrace.
By due desarte, whereon (ay me) to think:
From sweet delight, my head begins to shrink.
And coolde of care so nips my heart at root,
as that except, you favor seem to show:
No sun can shine, that well may do it boot,
with frost of fear, it will be withered so.
Wherefore dear dame, let favor save the flower:
Whose life or death, lies only in your power.
Oh che dolor.
IF in the world, there be but only one,
against whose good hap, both heaven and earth are bent,
Whom lot has left in sorrows seat alone,
her thriftles time, with fruitles travel spent
To wail in vain, and mourning so to dye,
by heavens I think, that only wenche am I.
For natures griefs, are cured by Phisickes art.
and counsel, much does comfort careful mind:
But such a pange, does pinche me at the heart,
as Physic, friend, and all I frustrate find.
So that I see, the heavens for me prepare,
to live in thought, and pine away in care,
Then since such life, to some one is assignde,
and I that one, on whom that lotte does fall,
With crooked care, I will content my mind,
til death desirde, do make an end of all,
Whose long delays, I do too long endure,
and know not how, his comfort to procure.
Oh strange disease, that nature never knew,
then not to blame in leaving no redress:
Oh cause accursed, whereof such sorrow grew,
as soakes the heart that dies in distress.
Oh heart what help? but still in woes to waste:
til death often wishd, do end my dole at last.
The Lover casts all mourning away.
LAment that list, I can no longer mourn,
the heavy thoughts that lay upon my heart:
To happy joys the heavenly fates do turn,
and sweet conceits, have cut of sorrows smart.
The fear is fled, of heavenly favor lost,
and hope attainde, of that I wished most.
My most desire, was service due reward,
my greatest fear, was force of fortunes spite:
My prayer yet, the heavenly powers have hard,
that due desarte, might once enjoy delight.
Which I protest, since that I now possess:
my grief no more, nor joy was ever less.
Your favor was the thing my service sought,
and your dislike, did make me doubt despite:
But yet my heart, had still this happy thought,
when rage was past, remorse would lend delight,
Which true I find, and sing in heart therefore:
lamente that list, for I will mourn no more.
The Lover compares his ill luck, to Philomelas ill fortune.
NOthing on earth remains, to show aright
the pattern true of my increasing care:
But Philomela with her song by night,
whose rueful state to mine I may compare.
With careful watch she preaches in the tree,
when creatures all into their nestes do creep:
So from mine eyes all sweet repos does flee,
when men are wont of course to take their sleep.
She with a thorn, against her tender breast:
I with the darte, of cruel loves unrest.
This gentle bird, her yealding voice does strain,
to wayle the wrongs, that Progne did endure:
I haples man, upon the wight complain,
that causeles does, to me these woes procure.
And when she does, a tune so doleful frame,
as well might move, the heavens to moan her plight,
(Oh grief of griefs) yet such as hear the same,
rue not her song, but therein take delight,
Likewise my plaints, which bring from me salt tears
seem pleasant suites unto my mistres ears.
An other.
THe tender budde that bravely ginnes to blow,
while sunnie showers yealdes comfort to the root,
If that unawares, there fall a sudden snow,
no sun can serve, that well may do it boot,
Except it hold but for a day, and so
it may have leave, to make a lively show.
My self the flower, that flourish all too fast,
while favor flonge fair weather in my face:
But now must die, my pleasures ouerpast,
to see disdain, so drive me in disgrace
By due desarte, whereon (ay me) to think:
From sweet delight, my head begins to shrink.
And coolde of care so nips my heart at root,
as that except, you favor seem to show:
No sun can shine, that well may do it boot,
with frost of fear, it will be withered so.
Wherefore dear dame, let favor save the flower:
Whose life or death, lies only in your power.
Another.
THe day of my delight is ouercast,
And clouds of care begin apace to rise:
The sun does go his course, midday is past,
Night will ensue, my mistres shuttes her eyes,
The glistering beams whereof, gave me that light:
Which others have, whilst I bewail the night.
But should the sun stand always in one place*
Sure that contrary were unto her kind:
The warm desires that grow by her good grace,
Would burn, and so con^ume both heart and mind.
The course we keep in middle sphere is best,
Where rolling still, she seeks a place to rest.
Disdain does drive these clouds of my despair:
And shades the sun from shining in the air.
Another.
THe shafte that Cupids bow has shot,
has Vulcane forged in my breast:
The fire which made the iron whotte,
desire did blow and never rest,
The cooles of care which burnte was love,
the steel was trust whereon he strikes:
The hammers hope which always prove,
to frame the shape which best he likes.
Tears serve the turn to quench the fire,
and fancy files the arrow head:
Pain pays the workmen for their hire,
the wound is deep, which never bled.
Lenuoy.
To heal this hurt, is readyest mean:
To shoot his arrow back again.
A Gentleman dallyeth with his Lute.
THou know (my Lute) if thou know ought,
that Music still does covet change:
Stale beaten stuff is counted naught,
new from the stamp is counted strange.
And strange devises still delight,
such dainty wits as diverse be:
Dear bought is good in every plight,
far fette, for Ladies, and for me.
If Tigell bring us nothing else,
but still do plead upon a song:
And play us naught but Osnay bells,
then Tigell does the Cuckoo wrong.
Lie down therefore, my little Lute,
and give me leave a litte while:
From case to pluck my little Flute,
the time a little to beguile.
Thou knewst when I was well content,
til midnight thee for to embrace:
Another now will thee prevent,
and seek to keep thy wonted place.
And I who thought it did suffice,
with thee an hour or two to play:
Must now assay in other wise,
some sport to find till it be day.
Content thee then and hold thee still,
my Lute I pray thee do not fume:
Although I seek against thy will,
another instrumente to tune.
And when I have assaide my wits,
that I can play both true and plain:
Then will I visit thee by fittes,
and will return to thee again.
The Lover showing his loyalty, and findinge no favor, is contented to give
over.
I Marvel why you be so strange,
when once you did profess such love:
Or why seek you so sudden change,
since fault in me you cannot prove.
My service has been ready preast,
at every beck to come at call:
And I as faithful as the rest,
or any one amongst them all.
The day as yet has loathsome been,
in which my service has been tried:
The loyalty that I live in,
and constant heart wherein I bide.
The surging seas, the flashing floods,
are here at bar my trothe to prove:
The craggie hills, the desarte wooddes,
if they could speak would show my love.
My tongue, my pen, my hand, my heart,
were ever bente to do your will:
And I not minded for to starte,
but so for to continue still.
Yet all this trothe, which I do owe,
you seem but little to regard:
The faithful love which I did sow,
does yealde disdain for my reward.
But since my chance does so befall,
I must of force this love refrain:
As good to leave as to lose all,
if grief be all that I shall gain.
Since then, for that I long and sue,
some others have for little cost:
It Is time to leave and say adue,
shake hands with me and farewell frost.
Another.
I May and I may not,
I would but I cannot,
For making of strife.
If I might as I may not,
I would do as I do not,
But if that I shall not,
Then farewell my life.
But yet I doubt not,
Neither despair I not,
If you deny not,
My lawful request.
While you dissemble not,
Smile on and spare not,
More pleasure I ask not,
Then you to love best.
A Lover forsaken, despayreth.
MY senses are not yet so dull,
as you (perhaps) suppose they be:
For I can spy and mark at full,
the crafty sleightes you use with me.
And time will come ere it be long:
I may requight you of this wrong.
For though I wink I am not blind,
through little holes the day I spy:
Your subtle secreate I can find,
wherewith you think to bleare mine eye,
And yet I seem to slumber still,
when that I see against my will:
I taste alas (the more my pain)
the brackish tears as salt as brine,
That trickling on my cheeks remain,
distilling from my blubbered eyne.
So much you feed me with this taste:
that life and all therewith you waste.
I hear and so do many more,
your nipping frumppes and taunting toys:
And where you blaze them well I know,
among your youthful Courtly boys.
Which when I hear, I would that death,
would come and stop my gasping breath.
I smell my loathsome carryon coarce,
with carping cares tournd now to dust:
In thee remaynes yet no remorce,
but beastly still, live as you lust.
Like smelling hounde, I vent thy trace:
and can foot out thy vaulting place.
I feel the privy grieping nippes,
wherewith you purpose me to kill:
Who looks for ought at sower slippes,
but choakiug fruit, that soon will spill.
I feel you tear and rent my heart:
though undeserved for my part.
I see that death his brows does bend,
I taste all pains that one may have,
I hear the bell biddes make an end,
I smell the dampnes of my grave.
I feel, and so I will conclude:
that all my love you do delude.
The praise of his Lady.
WHat man can keep in silence long
the beauty of so fair a dame:
Or who can hold or stay his tongue,
from blasing out her worthy fame?
Though land and life thereon did lie:
I tell you trothe it is not I.
Whose beauty when I seek to blase.
I see the dulnes of my wit:
Yet does it nothing me amase,
good will enforces so to it.
And I am vrgde against my will:
to show the bluntnes of my skill.
Her comely face who list to view,
with all the features of the same:
Must needs her term (if he say true)
a Gods, and no earthly dame.
For Helen she does pass as far:
as doah the sun the shining star,
Behold her body straight as line.
her arms so tirmme, so long, so smll:
Her hands so neat, so white, so fine,
her fingers long and straight withal.
That you would easly judge with me:
the like of her unborn to be.
I needed not (if she were here)
with poynted words to praise her grace:
Nor to display her favor clear,
with all the beauty of her face,
I wish this rowme she did ^^pplie:
then should you see if that I lie,
If princockes Paris were alive,
and choice of damsels had at will:
Disposed once again to wiue,
his wits I know were not so ill,
To leave vnchoase this Princely piece:
for all the passing gyrles of Greece.
Not This be brave that was sometime
a Lover unto Piramus:
Lucretias favor for to find,
wherewith she coyde Tarquimius.
But she does farther both excel:
then I am able for to tell,
In fine, if equally you would
each part in her with judgment way:
By true constrainte confess you should,
and thereof here my life I lay.
It were not now in natures might,
to frame so fair and trim a wight.
To all these graces, she has store
of mercy and of perfect love,
No earthly wight I know has more,
as trial tells, when truth shall prove,
I hard when nature said and swear,
she was the Jewel of her ware.
For mad you might me then condemn,
if I would think my self so wise:
That I were able with my pen
to set her out before your eyes*
Since well I know, the like by birth;
as yet did never live on earth.

WAy Lady mine, I thee beseech with loyal loving heart:
In equal balance my good will, and yield me my desert.
Lady. Lay forth in true vnforged tale, the sum of all thy suite:
Even as my ear shall like or leave, so look to reap thy fruit.

Lover. Let favor thine then furnish up, that fancy mine does crave:
Lend Lover true, for lew of love, the guerdone he should have.

Lady. Truth lies not always in the show, that glisters in the eine:
Trust asks further trial still, and trial asks time.

Lover. I cast my glove to him that dares, my loyalty disprove:
A better proof in alder years, was never gin for love.

Lady. Young, hot, and lusty bloods seeks thus, their vowed trothes defense:
^old ladies crave for milder profes, of plighted friends pretense.

Lover. My dear, if boistrous words offend thy virgins melting breast:
Know here what proof my Lady loves, that likes her lover best

Lady. Experience though it never learnd, my greenish years to love:
Long since has taught that tract of time, this trustines does prove.

Lover. Except I sue and serve thee then, while lungs shall lend me breath:
Let all the ill that heart can think, procure (...) death.

Lady. Ask then and have, as thou deseruest, so look for thy desire:
N^ shall my bitter nay deny, if justly you require.

Lover. I care not Lady for thy coin, I crave no Iunos gold:
Nor Pallas prudence do I seek, my Venus love I would.

Lady. Endeavor thy behests to keep, thou needs no longer sue:
While Lettice lives, Will shall not want, if he continue true.
Great thanks for this great grace I yeald, and god in heaven thee give
Expense of Nestors years on earth, and then in heaven to live.

AS each man spics a time,
his grief for to bewail:
And does pour out from baylefull breast,
the woes that him annoy:
So have I seuerde out this time
in hope for mine avail.
To show my friend my griuoues panges,
and eke my blisfull joy.
The woeful plight which present now,
I do in breast sustain:
The pleasures eke which now are past,
I will to mind them call:
For too too long in secreate breast,
I have them kept with pain.
With sighs that boyles from out my breast,
most bitter like to gall.
There was a time when as I set
my love upon a Less,
And lent my lyking out to loan
to lull my lyking lust:
Because she present in mine eye,
me thought did all surpass.
But sure within her secret breast
did harbor then no trust.
For after we had dwelt awhile,
in pleasures sweet delight:
And hushed our senses both asleep,
as lyk'd our persons best:
Then crept there in this croppe of care,
which wrought me this despite.
And took from me the loving Less,
and did disturb our rest.
And now do I appeal to you,
take pity if you may
On him that is tormented still,
with woes his life that wear:
And for thou art a faithful friend,
lo thus of thee I pray,
Let not this froward hap of mine,
my tender heart still fear.
Another.
COnsider well I pray, the lines that here I wright:
Naught else but dole and doleful things, I profer to thy sight.
No cause at all I have, to write of any joy:
My mind is whelmde in deep distress, and tombled in annoy.
My serses all do quake, to think upon my grief:
For to bewail my woeful hap, that cannot find relief.
What favor should he have, whom fortune has defide:
By rigor of the law it is hard, for any to be tried.
By Law, why said I so? no Law there is I think:
That bars true lovers from their joys, but he that still does winck
And blinking like a bussarde fool, can laugh to see our woes:
And nothing for our help, will he seek out the Lord he knows
Oh would it were in me poor soul, the waggish God to tame:
If he then wrought us such despite, in me then were the blame.
But why do I now wish, for things which pass my reach?
It were as much for me to crave, fine Tullie for to teach.
Good Lady yet give ear a while, and hear my woeful plaint:
Seek (I beseech) to search his wound, whom love does sore attaint
And do not still reject your thrall, when as he does co^plain:
And think not light the direful panges, that I for you sustain.
Ten thousand griefs a day I feel, and ten times ten more woes:
And eke a thousand thousand sighs my pensive heart out throws
I live a thousand times a day, I die ten thousand more:
And yet I am as near of thee, as I have been of yore.
Let pity once take place, and move thy loving mind,
That I for all my torments past some favor once may find.
Another.
GOod Lordinges give me leave a while,
to beat my brains about a toy:
The further that I wade therein,
the deeper wade I in annoy.
The less I think thereon in sooth,
the greater bliss shall hap to me.
The fewer times I hear thereof,
the happyer man sure shall I be.
The less in sight the better luck,
the furthest of, the most at ease:
And yet this is the straungest case,
for life I dare it not displease.
For life and all thereon depend,
what rests then for to ensue?
My Lady bars, I may not tell,
therefore dear hearts, count you it true.
For if I once knew what it mente:
her should I have that me it sent,
Philomelas fie.
FIe flattering face in an unfaithful friend,
Fie on mischaunce, where never was mistrust:
Fie fond desire, that finds dispightfull end,
Fie, fie, that faith should ever prove unjust.
Fie froward fate, which makes me singing cry:
Fie fortune, fie, and falshoode, fie, fie, fie.
But fie for shame, this song yealdes small delight,
When every note does run on fie, fie, fie:
Oh weigh the cause, is her accursed spite,
Which makes her thus lament her misery.
It is her note so sweet, and not her song,
Whereto we love to listen too so long.
So may my note seem sweet, although my fie,
May seem (perhaps) a most unpleasant word:
Although I sing, in heart alas I cry,
Fie pleasure fie, I must with this poor bird,
Go shroude my self, as one with sorrow slain.
Till merry May, may make me rise again.
And then this Bird shall come and singe with me,
Such heavenly notes, as may each ear delight:
And every one that does my sorrow see,
Shall curse the cause of my accursed spite.
And some al night, shall gladly leave their nest:
To hear record, of our unquiet rest.
Alta peto.
THe hautie Lark, that feign would sit on hye,
And yet perforce, long time does sit below:
Will up at last, although he gain thereby
To his decay, a deadly overthrow.
Which makes my heart, that highly would aspire:
Seek how to clime, to height of my desire.
To prowle for pence, such gain yealds simple share,
To fight for flies, the conquest were but small:
To gain content, my mind shall only dare
To venture death, in clyming though I fall.
But careful hope, must hoyse me bp alofte:
Least footing fail, and then I fall not soft.
And when I clime, the tree shall be of life,
The fruit of faith, the field the ground of grace:
My ladder love, and care my cutting knife
To proyne such sprigges, as may annoy the place,
Reason the ground, to stay me from a fall:
And hope my hold, to touch the top of all.
A Gentleman mislyking of his Mistres, sent her at his departure, these six
sower lines for a farewell.
ALthough you count, your haven a sea of bliss.
I nothing like, to anchore in your fludde:
I fear in faith, so sweet the water is,
that over use, has made the bottom mudde:
And south to say, I cannot well away,
in common cockex, to put my bark in bay.
Farewell foul, false, and filthy forger, P. I.

The Mistres of this gentleman, having more cause to dislike of him, then he to
misleeke of her, requiteth him with these six lines following.
THe seas you seem to set so little by,
no harbor is for every rotten bark:
Let be the flood, and let the Anchor lie,
It flotes not here, you need not therefore carke.
And sooth to say, the bay bears such a grace:
uneaths it likes to harbor ought so base.
Farewell fond, false, fleering, and fantastical fool. P. M.

Verses out of Borbonius.
MArcus Auarus heri cum se suspendere vellet,
sexque obulis misero, restis emenda foret:
Territus hoc pretio, restim (inquit) non emo tanti,
quinque obulis tandem, conuenit atque perit.
Mark Miser, yesterday I hard
the hanging craft would try,
And under three pence caitife wretch,
no halter could he by.
I buy no roapes so dear (quoth he)

For two pence halfepeny he agreede
at last, and hangs him self.
Le home.
THis gear bears prick and price my girl,
of all that ere I see:
La feme.
The prick for me, sir, I cry first,
the price I leave for thee.
Corpus, opes, animam, formam, vim, lumina, scortum,
Debilitat, perdit, necat, aufert, eripit, orbat.
The body, wealth, the mind,

Does weaken, leese, kill, race, and steal,
and eke depriueth sore.

YOung lust of love in hoarie locks:
on Ladies loins lay lasye knockes.
Old beldames then do you receive:
the cripple knights young Ladies leave.
Angels.
MIne angels still they be so fledge, they fly,
or else in ship they floate with puffed sails:
Or with their legs they leap and run awrie.
or driven away by Dragons with long tails.
Legs, wings, and ships, the devil in dragons shins:
To bear away mine angels never linnes.
A Riddle.
SC^lere vehor, materna carne vescor, quaero patrem meum^
Matris meae virum, vxoris meae filium.
Foul is my fault, that feed my fill,
and gorge on mothers bowels still.
With busy care I seek my Sire:
my mothers husband I require.
And such a one that man must be:
as is the son of wife to me.
Money still restless.
GOod money be demourant with me still,
and then thou shall be pendaunte in my purse:
But if thou will be volant at thy will,
or coorraunte else, thy harbore will be worse.
Voussera still incloased in my chest.
whereas thou runst abroad sance any rest.
A fantastical passion.
MY vain is done to write in prose or verse,
For why? I see my wits begin to fail:
Full feign I would a woeful tale rehearse,
but sorrow so, my senses does assail,
That I am forcde, to say and end in brief:
I cannot wright, I am so full of grief.
A bird to a birder.
A Fowler snarlde a little bird, with lymed bushe of late,
To whom for life and liberty, the pretty foul does prate
She begges her ransom at a price, and promises for pay
Three jewels rich, The birder then so biddes her fly away:
Escaped thus, now list (quoth she) Hereafter hold thine own:
Trust not to much: nor take no care for that which hence is floe^
Henceforth if thou apply thy self, to rule thee by these three:
No little foul as I, shall make so great a fool of thee.
The abuse of the world.
THe mournful mind, the overwhelmed brain,
the wits bewitchd, that wearyed are with woes:
The pensive heart that pines away in pain,
the troubled thoughts whom thousand cares enclose
Does still I see, consume my carkase so,
as naught but death, can rid me of this woe.
Long have I hoapde, too long I find in vain,
and all in vain it is I find too late:
That pity would procure some ease of pain,
but pride is full, pufte up with deadly hate.
Disdain is grown so great with beauties grace:
as humble suites are all thrust out of place.
Humility is thought a silly slave,
deserte is deemde a peeuishe painful drudge:
Truth thought deceate, and flattery no knave,
craft credit gains, good dealing may go trudge.
This all too late, to my despite I find:
which makes me thus to wail and mourn in mind
The Author troubled with hope and despair.
TWo things there are that trouble much my mind,
the one is hope, the other is despair:
In hope, my heart does heavenly comfort find,
and peevish dread, my pleasures does impair,
Hope to good hap, does give me up amayne:
Despair as fast, does flinge me down again.
I hope the best and yet do dread the worst,
which wretched dread says hope is all in vain:
And hope biddes me account that dread accursed,
that lets my help, my heavenly wish to game.
And hope assures that reason does require:
although despair deny me my desire.
Therefore I hope, although withal I fear:
because I hope my hope will banish dread:
Which makes despair both day and night to bear
my tossed brains within my troubled head.
This passion strange, twixt hope and fear I find:
is that which long, has much perplexed my mind.
The Author troubled with love and hate.
TWo things there are that much torment my mind,
the one is love, the other deadly hate:
The force of love does make affection blind,
and blind desire does set my wits at bate.
They beat my brains to make what means they may
I find in fine to work mine own decay.
I like not love, again I love not hate,
yet love or hate, I needs must take the one:
The choice is hard which were the better state,
and happy he could let them both alone.
For he that knew them both as well as I:
would loathe his life, and gladly wish to die.
Love often breeds hate, whom luckles lots ensue,
and foul despite does sore consume the heart,
Which seeks revenge that honest minds do rue,
when conscience pricks, does cause repentant smarte.
This for my self, as once before I said:
has made my mind and senses so dismayde.
And yet alas, I cannot choose but love,
yet hate my self to see my fond desire:
But cannot get my fancy once remove,
that in my heart has kindled hateful fire.
But must of force my wretched mind content:
to live in grief until my days be spent.
Another.
THe longer life the more offense,
the more offense, the greater pain:
The greater pain, the less defense,
the less defense, the loss of gain.
The loss of gain, long life does try:
wherefore come death and let me die.
The shorter life, less count I find
the less accounte, the sooner made:
The count soon made, the merryer mind,
the merrier mind, does thought euade,
Short life well spent, the same does try:
wherefore come death and let me die.
Come gentle death the ebb of care,
the ebb of care, the flood of life:
The flood of life, the joyful fare,
the joyful fare, the end of strife.
The end of strife, for that wish I
wherefore come death and let me die.

MIstrust misdeemes amiss,
whereby displeasure grows:
And time delayde, finds friends afraid,
their faith for to disclose.
Suspecte that breeds thought,
and thoughts to sighs conuarte:
And sighs have sought a flood of tears,
where sobbes do soake the heart.
This heart that means no harm,
must feed on sorrows all:
Until such time in please the judge,
the truth in question call.
Though cause of great mistrust,
before the judge appear:
My truth and mercy of the judge
I trust shall set me clear.
Report thus runs at large,
my truth for to detecte:
Yet truth in time shall try it self,
and drive away suspecte.
Believe not every speech,
nor speak not all you hear:
For truth and mercy of the judge.
I trust shall set me clear.

WHat watch, what woe, what want, what wrack,
is due to those that toil the seas:
Life led with loss, of pains no lack,
in storms to win much restles ease.
A bedlesse boarde at seas in rest:
may chance to him that chances best.
How sundry sowndes with lead and lines,
into the deep the shipman throws:
No foot to spare he tries often times
no near, when hoe, the master blows.
If Neptune frown all be undone,
straightway the ship the wrack has wone.
Those dangers great do often befall,
on those that shores upon the sand:
Judge of their lives the best who shall,
how vile it is few understand.
Alack, who then may judge the game?
not they which have not felt the same,
But those that sail in storm and wind.
and days and years have spente therein:
Such well may judge, since proof they find
in rage no rest, till calm again;
No more may those that love do feign:
give judgment of true lovers pain.

ARise o noble Sidney now,
and hear the merry Robin singe:
The birds on every bushe and bough,
with warbling make the woods to ringe.
Dame Flora fresh in mantle green,
does weight upon a maiden Queen.
And out are gone by break of day:
a world of Dames to bring in May.
When Phoebus shines in lofty skies,
and Luna yealdeth up her light:
It Is time for waking wits to rise,
and bid adue the drowsy night.
Great sleepers have but little health,
the wise will walk and use his skill:
The sluggarde wantes both wit and wealth,
and lives in need, and scareslie still.
Arise o noble Sidney etc.
The labourer finds his feeding sweet,
the idle heads have idle brains:
The slothful sheep has simple sprites,
and much desires and little gaynes.
The house but breeds great cares in breast,
the field takes toys from troubled mind:
As grief and sickness follow rest
so health through labor must men find.
Arise o noble Sidney etc.
As bees seek hunny out of flowers,
and travails far for pleasures sake
So man delights in summer bowers,
and for sweet things some toil must take:
For needful sleep the bed is good,
whilst night be clips the world about:
But in the day each lusty blood,
on hills or dales are walkinge out.
Arise o noble Sidney etc.
Since May does come so kindly in,
and does rejoice both man and boy:
With mirthe we do this May begin,
in hope to end the year with joy.
A soldier does this daybell ringe,
who wishes well to worthy wight,
And we poor boys his farewell singe,
to worthy Sidney noble knight.
Arise o noble Sidney etc.
A Riddle.
A Thing there is a friend told me,
that none can feel, nor hear, nor see:
Which breeds many deadly smarte
and eke with grief consumes the heart.
For which is found none other ease,
but one, the cause of the disease.
Now this is my desire of thee:
to be resolude what this may be.
Answer:
THe thing that breeds such a grief,
as but by it find no relief,
Is strange, yet not so strange I trow:
but one by study soon may know.
And at a venture this I guess,
It Is Love.
And why smile you.
I Smile to see the world so full of toys,
I smile to see that toys should so delight:
I smile to show by signs such secret joys,
as but for shame, would make me laugh outright.
To show such mirth as manners do conceal:
and smiles (in kind) can never half reveal.
But for I see that laughing is too light,
and smiling shows a modest merry mind:
I will conceal my secret sweet delight,
save by a smile you may my fancy find.
Then why I smile, the cause be sure is this:
somewhat is well, I say not what it is.
I smile to think what what, that what may be.
I smile again at pretty iestes I find:
And now I smile at secret smiles I see,
I smile in sign to show a merry mind.
And so I leave to write, but not to smile:
mirth among friends may be alone awhile.
And why sigh you?
I Sigh to see the world so full of woes,
I sigh, to think of secret misery:
I sigh, to show that speech may not disclose,
I sigh, and could, and but for shame would cry.
That tears might tell such torments of the mind:
as sighs nor sobbes, can never show in kind.
But for I see, that women use to weep,
and gallante minds, their secret grief conceal:
I will awhile, unseen my sorrows keep,
least womanlike, I do my woes reveal.
Then why I sigh, the cause, be sure, is this:
(I say not what) but somewhat is amiss.
I sigh to think, that somewhat is so much,
as that in some, there cannot be much more:
I sigh, to think my secreat sorrow such,
as makes my heart, to sigh and sobbe so sore,
And so I leave to wright, but sighing still:
to show by sighs, that sighing will me kill.
Plus amor, que la vie.
MY chance was good, who can say nay?
my hap was hitte that instant time:
When I for solace seemde to go,
to garde^^e in the springing prime.
Whereas me thought I saw did clime,
Fair gallante girls, the one was such
As to recount it grieves me much.
They climde, but whether? would you know?
trust me, in truth I cannot tell:
Mine eyes were dazeled with the show.
of her which I did mark too well.
For why? of troth, she did excel.
And so surpaste the other train:
That they but shadows seemed plain.
The other three were Venus joys,
in whom the Gods took delight:
She keeps them from all dire annoyes,
if they complain, it makes her spite.
She is their Patrones by right.
Wherefore in them she suits her shows:
And nothing cares for mine God knows.
But why should I grave at their gain,
Minerua is the patron dear
Which shields my lady from the pain,
that Venus brattes feed for their cheer.
These wantons think they have no peer.
Till sturdie Mars does lay the baight:
And then they cry Peccaui straight.
The glistering glee, which they retain,
the outward shows of Venus joys:
The curled hear, the faces plain,
the fine proportion of her boys.
My Lady countes them all as toys.
And thinks that tricks her passing trim:
Out of their waves of woe to swim.
Well since (my Dear) thou have begoon,
in Dians sacred fields to walk:
Where all the virtues still do won,
and flowers croppe from dainty stalk,
There rest thou still, with them to walk.
And let me languish still in woe:
For that is al I crave, you know.
Another.
TO vaunte before the conquest got,
to triumph still fore victory:
Were too too diffamous a blotte,
if hap should hit the contrary.
So that I said, it is the wisliest done:
Never to vaunte, till victory be won.
And then to vaunte, and double vaunte it too,
to triumph then, it were to thee no blame:
For so of right thou ought then to do,
because thy foe of right does bear the shame.
Thy triumph then, does merit naught but this:
with Laurel bow, for to be crownde I wis.
But what deem you him, worthy for to be?
which triumphs still, before the conquest got,
If then a judge you will allow of me,
he sure deserves, no whit at all God wot.
But as he is, so shifte him to his mates:
and let him seek, for conquest without gates.
But pardon me, which meaner conquest seek,
what conquest is it? would you so feign it know?
No victor I, the vanquished is most leeke,
to conquer me, as plain I here will show.
So that I count my self already quelde:
and mean to yealde before I be compelde.
The Dame that has, my conquering heart put down,
and pulde allow, the stomach which I bare:
With blows? no, no, it was done with a frown,
which breeds to me, the terror of my care.
Wherefore I mean, to yealde me to thy grace:
some lovely looks, thou will extend percace.
Then since to you I yealde, as vassal hear,
and stand to crave for mercy at your hands
Good Lady then, some pity let appear,
and lose from me, the lewd and lucklesse bands.
Which binds me still, to be to you a thrall:
joy when I rise, rejoice not when I fall.
Another.
THree new years gifts, three ladies craude at once,
and thrice renewde their treble suite to me:
And three times thrice, I wished for the nonce,
that I could sort, each Lady out her fee.
As they deserude, so should it always be.
which when I heard, then did I cast in mind:
Chiefly what gifts for them I best might find.
As gorgets brave, or shadows for the head;
Or shutes of lawne, or net that finely shows:
their glutted eyes with them be always fed,
And for such toys, they nothing care, God knows.
in meaner things their minds they do repose.
And means to take, such gifts as he can give:
whereby the geuer, by the gift may live.
Gloves say you then, be they the gifts you crave,
To keep from sun, the whitenes of your hands:
alas (good souls) the sun you feign would have,
As weather serves, and state of year now stands
to cool your lilly white, you need no fannes.
The nipping frostes, and blustering winds do show:
what like good will you unto summer owe.
That like good will, I would you ought to me,
Then like for gifts, I surely you should find:
no gloves it is, that I crave of you three,
But mere good will, which me to you will bind.
for so be sure, I still do fix in mind.
Not geuers you, but I will weigh your gift:
Cry not boe peep, it is but a simple shiste.
Another.
IN rage and grief, against the world I wright,
in dole, deep drencht, in pain perplexed sore:
Alive, as dead I seem, in each man's sight,
out of the world exempted clean therefore.
That out I cry, and crying, still will say:
fie upon love, why breedst thou my decay?
Fie upon love, why do I thereof plain?
nay rather fie upon my gasing eyes:
That such a foil would let me to sustain.
of one that does both me and mine despise.
Which makes me cry, and crying, still will say:
The Italian blood does breed my dire decay.
The Italian blood, fie, fie upon them all
which craftily creepes out of Cresids kind:
They love to keep both man and mind in thrall:
and in their woes, they joy still in their mind,
Which makes me cry, and crying still to say:
fie Italy, why breeds thou my decay?
Fie Italy, why do I curse thee so?
nay rather fie upon too forward will:
Which sought too soon, to faune upon my foe,
without the guide of sacred wisdoms skill.
Which being spide, she made me straight to say:
when you command (dear Mistres) I Will obey,
Obey, but how? too soon to froward mind,
which sought me clean to ouerwhelme in care:
She scornde to see how glad she did me find,
to feed on grief, which was my daily fare:
For which good deeds of hers, I still will say:
fie on thee wretch, why seekst thou my decay?
A Sonet.
WHat should I write? what should I say?
what should I do to weep my fill?
I crouch, I kneel, I still obey,
and yet my heart she seeks to spill.
So that with grief I grunt, and groan with care:
which daily is my sustenaunce and fare.
My meat is moan, my drink is dreadfulnes,
my solace sower, my music naught but woe:
My mind is turnde unto forgetfulness,
and I lie wallowing in my sorrows so.
That in the end I cry for morning gray
and wish for night ten thousand times a day.
Lo thus I live, and living thus, I die,
but dying now, I hope to live again:
For by experience lo, thus much I try,
that dying well, we never feel more pain.
When I am dead, quite gone, and laid in grave:
for me again, no wisdom it is to crave.
Another.
Try ere thou trust, the proverb says so true,
and trust not thou, before thou well have tried:
For here to each I will set down in view
what vile despite was hid ere I it spide
In Lady fair, in whom I took delight,
who at the length, wrought me this foul despite.
I loved her dear, and she did like me well.
as then I thought, that better could not be:
In words, in show, in speech, lo thus I tell,
the fault was hers, the foil was mine you see.
And I poor soul, (thus flouted) went my way:
and she did laugh, that wrought my dire decay.
Badde was the best, that fell unto my share,
and worse was hers, if she do weigh it well:
For though to me it bring some carking care,
that her disgraces vilie, I can tell.
So that I see, my hap did fall out best:
to leave a blackbirde, cloase within her nest.
Amor altus.
COnstrainde by love, though half held back by fear.
headlong I run, into the hands of hap:
With mind amasde, I wend I wot not where,
seeking no seat, but in dame Venus lap.
But down proud heart, do not presume so hie:
Least fortune frown, I fall, and then I die.
But live or die, affection does enforce
the hautie heart to clime, although it fall:
Sweet pity seems to promise some remorce,
and love will serve, the highest Saint of all.
To servants, fall sometime a happy hire:
for due desarte, the sum of their desire.
To lie below, and see our joys alofte,
what mind so base, but venture would a ioynte:
What though I slip, and that I fall not soft,
if life yet hold, I do not care a point.
For hope of joys, will help my present pain:
heart hold up head, hand help to clime again.
Me thinks I see where Dame Diana sittes,
and Cupid cries, hold Hope, and ^lime by care,
And Pallas by, who does instruct my wits,
by humble suite to win a happy share.
And Venus smiles, what should I wish for more?
up sure I will, and if I die therefore.
Another Riddle.
WHat thing on earth breeds greatest grief?
Yet lends the heauiest heart relief.
That is the cause of greatest joy:
Yet thousand ways does breed annoy.
Both spoils and saues, sleas and reuiues:
Prolonges, and shortens many lives.
This thing is very strange I trow:
Yet I of thee the same would know.
Answer.
WHat breeds delight, yet works pain?
That hurts sore, yet heales again?
That is the cause of great despite:
And yet does purchase sweet delight*
That heals some of deadly smarte:
And strikes some other dead at heart.
It should be strange, what so it is:
But sure if I judge not amiss:
It Is all one with the same that I
Propounded you, It Is love perdie.
Mors mihi vita.
COnsumde with cares, and ouerwhelmde with woes
I bid adue, to such as live in joy:
Contented well, my loathed life to lose,
as fortune still did follow with annoy,
For as I feel, my death draw neare^ on:
I see the smarte of all my sorrows gone.
Whereby I see sweet death the end of dole,
while life prolonges, the wretched soul in pain:
The salve of death makes sickest hearts soon hole,
when care is found a comfort all in vain.
Yet dying thus, ere I be thoroughly dead:
accept this counsel of a careful head.
Love not to live, nor yet desire to die,
but live to die, so dying look to live:
Such dying life, such living death have I,
which makes me thus, the world this comfort give.
To dread no death, but count him for our friend:
who bringes us joys, and makes our sorrows end.
The Nightingales note.
THe Nightingale that singes the sweetest note,
of any bird that flies in the air:
Whose choice of sound with warblings in the throat
reuiues the heart that dies in despair.
In April first records, then sings in May:
and that m^onth past, she singing goes away.
Which heavenly note, might hold but half the year:
the joy thereof would cloy our ears with sweet:
Nothing so good, so rare, nor yet so dear,
but change for worse, the foolish man thinks meet,
So sweet and short is Philomelas song:
and naught esteemed, that lasts once too long.
But yet this song, that Philomela singes:
of sorrow groans, although the sound delight
Or hard mishappe, whereof such mischief springes,
she but records the sound of her despite.
So with that bird, may I singe fie, fie, fie:
while others joy in song to hear me cry.
Nil nisi probatum.
Among mishappes, which kill a careful heart,
to find a foe of an assured friend:
Is such a grief, as breeds that deadly smart,
which until death can never take his end.
Oh wretched world, where faith is so unjust:
that surest friends are sometime hard to trust.
But all too late I find the proverb true,
that friends are found, as fortune skoules or smiles:
But twice accursed that hollow hearted crew,
whose flattering face, the simple mind begiles.
And for my self, since frendshippe such I find:
I will accounte of each one in his kind.
Fair words shall stand for open flattery.
till faithful deeds may merit no mistrust:
And secreat traynes shall stand for treachery,
till trial find her dealinges not unjust,
But where I find the trothe at need, I cry:
with such a friend I vow to live and die.
The clogge of care.
THe clogge of care that hangs on heavy heart,
pulles down the head from lofty minds delight:
The sighs that grow of sorrows secreat smarte.
in time consumes the wretched carcass quight,
But comfort yet may cut that clogge away:
the cause of dole, whereby delights decay.
And then the heart will hold up head on hie,
and joy as much as it did mourn before:
Oh comfort come, and cut of by and by,
that cruel clogge, that cuttes my heart so sore.
I have too long, to careful thoughts been tide:
my mind cannot the burden long abide.
But all in vain for comfort still I cry,
my clogge of care is such, I cannot go:
I see too plain my doleful destenie,
to waste my days, in worlds of careful woe.
Which makes me thus to end my solemn song:
the careful heart can never hold out long.
Another.
THe Plowman sure are ye,
and I the sandy field:
Your harvest then must needs be gross,
that such a earth does shield.
The gold I mean my self,
the hutch my husbands heart:
The Mart is done, put up your pipes,
go whistle for your part.
And let me live at rest,
deuoyde of slanders blotte:
Contented with my faithful feere,
whom fortune did alofte.
For sure the Letchers love,
comes ever out of time:
I mean not to deface my fame,
with such a couerte crime.
I am no Younckers pray,
I skilles am in scapes:
I do detest the doting love
of Roysters, and their rapes.
I mean to run the race
of these my poasting days:
In such a sort, that none shall check
my youthful wanton ways.
Leave then to ransacke her,
that cares for no change:
Ne seek to false her faulcones faith.
with haggarde hawk to raunge.
Upon two Gentlewomens names.
MY fancy led me suddenly, as I did sit and sow:
Amongst some other secret things, a secret cause to know.
Remembering how the Poets use
Good Gentlewomen to abuse
All in their ditties when they choose
Resounding fame to blow.
Extolling in their Sonets then
The only praise of faithful men,
They list not see, how we women
Pass them, as I will show.
Hark not what Poets prattle then, from reason they declinde:
In Platoes School, thou may it learn, how friendship is definde.
Love lyketh where is loyalty,
Like loyalty in like degree;
In women this is chief to see,
Peruse and you shall find.
So says he that this frendlines,
Only does spring from humblenes,
None barreth women gentleness,
Except they bar their kind.
Perhaps I could adioyne to this, where most affection dwells:
How there the flower of frendlines, most pleasantly it smells.
Enritching women's goodly grace,
But here I need not in this place
Experience proves well this case
Ask her I say naught else:
Then since it comes to us by kind,
Keep not the secret cause to find,
In Poetry that is so blind,
No true tale once it tells.
Since loyalty, affection, and likeness of degree
On perfect proof, from cradle up, has linked thee to me,
No treasure rich, nor golden mine
Exchange shall make at any time
For as I was, so am I thine
Reposing trust in thee:
Enduring so, I do pretend
No change to make till life do end,
Damon was never dearer friend
So thou my Pithias be.
A merry conceate.
Our Wilkin now will wedde,
the goodlyest girl I guess
That ere this country bredde,
it is that bounsinge Besse.
That every jack for ale and cakes,
At every game his Lady makes.
He thinks his Lady bears the bell:
Pore horechit Hob:
And she belowtes the mome as well.
And there a bobbe.
How ere the world it wagges,
his Besse must needs be brave:
Gogs vish these rotten rags,
are vitter vor a zlaue.
Then vor my Lady zweares our Will:
And therewithal he smackes his Gil.
And she requites his busse again,
He likes well that:
He pays his Lady for her pain,
That hittes her patte.
To bear his flaunting port,
our Wilkin wants wealth:
He shames to yeald the sport,
and therefore seeks by stelth.
To maintain this his iollie ruff,
He stryketh hands with Saunder Snuff.
So forth together they two trigge,
To make a hand:
The booty must be very big,
That they two stand.
Our gaffar Simkin sold
his vorty sheep at fair:
And down the ruddocks told
are paid him in his chair.
Such payment round is good to tell,
He lykes his market very well.
Our Wilkin well of this was ware:
And geues a guess
That Besse and he shall have a share
Of Simkins mess.
The Penyfather Post,
his weson pipe to wette
He calls to his host,
a half perth nale to fette.
His ginger from his purse he draws,
And on the cup he lays his claws.
Upon bon viage there he spendes:
Three half pence flat:
On Madge, his mare, and on his friends,
That with him sat.
And homewarde then he plods,
with homely hobbing pace:
At every step he noddes,
in comely courtly grace.
But see the luck, amidde the way
Comes Will, and biddes vaer Simkin stay.
A yellow Iaundize their he said:
In Simkins purse:
Which if it be not quickly staide.
Will hurt them wurse.
Thy purse (quoth Will) does surge,
var Sim, an inche to low:
The perfect pills to purge,
my mates and I do know.
My self (says Will) will be thy leeche,
Wherewith his purse slides to my breeche,
Old Graybeard now may wipe his nose:
His gold is fludge:
To Birchin Lane for silken hose,
Does Wilkin trudge.
While R^ddockes yours be rife,
our Girl must have her part:
Else there begins the strife,
twixt Besse, and her sweet heart.
A kerchiefe now, atawdrie lace,
A hatte to hide her whorish face.
The arrante woman spies her time,
You may be bold:
The stammell will be soulde for fine
Crusado gold.
The pence are easly spent,
that roll so easly in:
How he that list forrent,
will fear thee not a pin.
Ten hundred shifts yet may be made
A thousand crafts yet will be ^ad.
Will and his girl will to the wine,
to tipple square:
While chinkes hold out they may be sure
Away the mare.
At boorde to her he drinks,
and turns it on the thumme:
The wily wench she winkes,
with nere a word but mumme.
With beckes and deckes his girl he wooes,
With necks and checks she does re^use,
A world to see our woing Will.
Alonge the street:
How he does square it with his Gill,
When they two meet.
The Cutter roystes it out,
with tospotte swearing cappe:
As sturdie and as stout,
as is the mouse in trappe.
And for his Lady will he fight,
As long as no man is in sight.
The Duckerell Darcies blow has got:
Oerthwarte the shankes:
His pretty Parnell spares not,
To play her pranckes.
A whelpe of a good hear,

An easy beast to bear,
well spaste, and sure behind*
She never flinges, but forward still,
The restie ^ade has nere her fill.
Of such a toward twigge the fruit
Is rotten ripe:
The youths will dance with little suite
T^ every pipe.
A couple fitly met,

Ere they at work will swette,

Such scapeth (...) litely fell their ware,

At last I charge them beg their bread
With dishe and ^lappe.
A Sonette made by Thomas Howell.
I Wish and crave the thing that works my woe,
I see the snare, yet have no power to shun:
I hold for friend, whom aye I held for foe,
In flying fire, upon the flame I run.
I pine in pain, when hist, no pleasure past,
In seeking heaven, I lie in Kimbo lake:
In blisfull bathe, most bitter bane* I taste.
And for the Eele, I grieping graspe the Snake.
The mark I seek, I see does pass my reach,
Yet still I prick, and prease, t'achieue the same:
Desire condemns what wisdom would me teach.
And folly faunes on grief in stead of game.
What vayleth it the irksome hook to spy,
That lurking lies in sweet and pleasant bait.
When power does want, the force thereof to fly.
In baine is seen the hurtefull (...) deceit,
Right thus in pleasures pathe (...) prison find,
Yet headlonge forth does haste and hold the way:
When Reason me, to r^le does put in mind,
My fancy says go on, and make no stay.
A. N. his answer to the same.
Leave of to wish the thing that works thy woe,
And thou shall shun the snare that thou do see:
Hold him no fr^nde whom the^ do find a foe,
So thou from (...) and (...) shall still be free.
Pain is a grief, (...) pleasures gains:
And Limbo^ (...) sought out*
So (...)

He is oreboulde, that (...) without his reach,
Though still he pricks, (...) never hope him in:
Drown the desire, so shall thee wisdom teach,
That folly faunes, where griefs the game begin.
It vayleth much the irksome hook to spy,

Wit will want force, where wisdom, wantes to fly,
That else in vain is seen the hid deceit.
In pleasante pathe, no pleasure is to find,
Though headlong forth thou haste, and hold thy way*
When reason rules put wisdom in thy mind,
Let Fancy say; got on and make no stay*
The discommodities of marriage.
Sith doubts (...)
Best hold^ (...) still alone,
For though you have (...):
The praise of a maiden, as plain did appear.
I will none by saint Mary, you make me to swear:
The charge is too costly, the ware is to dear.
I answer to you Sir, even after the rate:
That presently payned your self for to prate.
To praise the stale widow, with all her whole state,
Be she old, be she young Sir, I like no such mate.
But I will content me, as I did before:
To love, and to look to my self and no more,
For if that I marrye, I must look for a store:
And toil and trudge for it, till my boanes be all sore.
If I purpose to marry these chances ensue:
I must get her apparrelle, and that must be new
Least shortly I prove the Proverb be true.
You are welcome, be gone Sir, I am not for you.
I must woo her, and win her with silver and gold:
And other such jewels, as are to be sold.
And yet she is ready for every (...) ^olde:
To leave and forsake me to let fly her hold.
I must give her a purse, and eke a pin^ase:
A whistle, a tablet, a tawdrie lace.
A thimble of silver, to cover her face:
And all to obtain her favor and grace.
I must dance her attendaunce by day and by night:
Be pleasant and painful, all day in her sight.
And yet peradventure, and that's too much spite:
I shall gape for a Gudgin, and fish for a Snight.
If I chance to obtain her after this wise:
Then double and ^reable, my costs will arise.
I must then apparrelle her after the guise:
And find her such trinckets, as she can devise.
To household, we must have a hen and a cock:
A distaffe, a spindle, a wheel, and a rock.
A cassocke, a (...), a gown and a smock.
And for our Dames (...) a key and a lock.
A bed, and a (...), and other such (...)*
A fillet, a paste, a comb, and a glass.
A pot, and a pan, with vessels, and brass:
And twenty such toys, which here I let pass.
And yet it does chance most commonly after:
God sendes us a child, a boy or a daughter.
Then must I provide, who so ever begat her:
Some rags and some iagges, to fold and to wrap her.
A Nurse, and a midwife to hold up her back:
Some spyces, to make her a posset of sack,
And other such trinkets as these young wives do lack:
Which if that they have not, our love goes to wrack.
A cradle, a swathbande, a pillow of down:
A wastecote, a biggin, to wrappe the childs crown.
A wenche for to rock it, with down a down, down.
Or else it is time for me, to pack out a town.
A possenette, and sugar, to make the child pappe:
A blancket of woollen, the child for to wrappe.
If this be not gotten, such fortune may hap:
At her first vprysing I bear her a clappe.
If I marrye a widow, you bid me not care,
She brings all this gear, and other such ware.
Your stock and your treasure, thereby you may spare:
Enritching your substance, to maintain your fare.
But yet Sir, I pray you, remember well this:
Not one shrow of twenty, among them there is.
Whose children and kinsfolk, at any time miss
To prowle or convey away, that thing or this.
Now has she a daughter, now has she a son:
Now has she a Cousin the world has begone.
I must give them a ladle, a dishe and a spoone:
Which if I deny them, our frendshippe is done.
And then Sir, withal, she will clothe her in yelowes:
And ^uming and ^^etting, she begins to be ielious.
With scoulding and brawling, she lets not to tell us:
At stues and at tauerns, all is spent on good fellows.
She sumes and she frettes, she fomes like a bore:
She swears she was never thus used before.
Ere this time I might have bestowed my store:
To give at my pleasure a little or more.
If I (...) you say Sir, she makes me good cheer,
With caudels and possettes, and good double beer,
For money at all times I can buy this gear,
What need I to keep then, a wise all the year.
What need I to find one meat, drink and array,
To keep one at liuerie by night and by day.
For when I would dally with sport and with play,
I can meet with a sweeting, a snatch and away.
If once I do marry, and take me a wife,
To brauling and scoulding I am bound all my life,
To ^aunting and vaunting, to discord and strife,
The practice of this thing, is commonly ryfe.
I am bound for to tarry for her still at home,
To toil and to moyle for her all alone,
Whilst she sittes a feasting with old mother Ione,
I must be a drudging for her like a mome.
All these things, with other that I could resight,
From wooing and wiuing drive me away quight,
And I will bestow my sweetest delight,
With sweet sleep to pass out the long drowsy night.
These maids be so wanton, these widows so wood,
That neither of both will do me any good.
These widows be withered, they drink up my blood,
These maids be so lusty, I Will none by the roode.
And therefore I will, till you agree on the one:
Thus hold me contented to live still alone.
The commendation of hope.
WHo hops much and fears naught at all,
does show him self too desperate of mind:
Who fears much, and has his hope but small,
in such conceate, can little comfort find.
Who stammering stands, half hoping, half in dread:
assure him self, shall have a troubled head.
Who hopes for naught, nor fears ought at all,
is rather mad, or not of human kind:
Who ^lymes by hope, and fears every fall,
does doubtless bear, a most unquiet mind.
Who dreads the worst, and al ways hopes the best:
what ever hap, is ever best at rest.
But he that hopes, upon so sure a ground,
as sets the spite of foul despair aparte:
And to his hope, such heavenly hap has found,
as yealdes the thing, that most contents his heart.
Let him not boast, but give God thanks for all:
who helpte him up, and sau'de him from a fall.
For he it is that helps the honest heart,
that geues the hope that never needs to fear:
Which finds a salve to every sudden smarte.
and keeps the mind in quiet every where
In him alone, mine only hope shall rest:
this life once left, in heaven to live at rest.
A warning to wanton Lovers.
CEase sorrow now, for thou have done the deed,
for care has now, consumde my carcass quight:
No hope, no help, nor hap can stand in steed
for doleful days does cut of all delight.
Yet while I hear the toling of the bell,
before I die, I wright this fainte farewell.
Who loves to lead his life in quiet rest,
beware the worst, of what so may befall:
Abandone Love, feed not on fancies feast,
least hungry heart, in vain for comfort call.
And sorrow then, do so assail thy mind:
the wit bewitchd, a world of woes do find.
And then comes care for to tormente my heart,
when naught auayles to languish or lament:
For long the heart, does pine in secreat smarte,
before the days be quight in sorrow spent.
This find I true, and for good will I tell:
ware wanton love, and so I say farewell.
A fancy.
I Would, yet will not, yes, yes, no, no? why,
for that my will and would, do disagree:
For why? to work my would contentedly,
my wish to will does want too far I see.
Which makes me thus against my will to say:
I would, yet nill, but will when so I may.
I may? why now I may, yet may I not,
for that my may is not such as I would:
Yet what I may, full feign I would God wotte,
and more would wish, if so be that I could.
Which more might I, then would I quickly say
I would, and will, and glad in that I may,
But oh, that will his wish cannot attain,
and that delight, should so desire deny:
That willing hearts, should labor all in vain,
when will and words, do meet so contrary.
Yet what of this, I hope to see the day:
when that my would may find a willing may.
A farewell to Fancy.
Fancy farewell, that wroughtst my fond delight,
delight adue, that wroughtst my deep distress:
Distress adue, that wroughtst my deep despite,
Despite adue, for death does lend redress.
And death adue, for though I thus be slain:
in thy despite, I hope to live again.
Fair Dames adue, whose love has wrought my woe,
and farewell woe* that wearyed has my wits:
And farewell wit, with will bewitched so,
and farewell will, so full of frantic ^ittes.
Fransie farewell, whose sorce I feel too sore,
and farewell feeling, for I feel no more.
And life adue, that I have lou'de and loathd,
and farewell love, that makes me loathe my life*
Both love and (...) farewell unto you both,
twixt hope and fear, farewell all foolish strife.
Folly farewell, which I have fancyed so:
and farewell fancy, that first wroughtst my woe.
Adue desire, for death is hard at hand,
and yet again, I say adue to death:
Though loathed life do in deaths danger stand,
yet faith assures, when body loses breath,
The soul in heaven shall live, and fare right well:
which makes me cry, come death, and life farewell.
Both friends and foes, unto you all farewell,
farewell my friends, for frendshippe I have found
Farewell my foes, that truth in time may tell,
when that ^y bones be buried in the ground.
That with the world, I die in charity:
and so adue, the bell has done, I die.
And yet once more to death again adue,
for dying thus, me thinks, I live again:
My certain hope shows joys that do ensue,
and heart finds ease of former pinching pain.
Which makes me thus by certain prouse to tell
faith fears no death, I dying, live, farewell.
Counsel given to a friend.
WHen gallant youth has gone a while at will,
and followed that which fancy does affecte:
And sees in time by proof of sacred skill,
What wisdom would that reason should respect.
He then returns from former vanytie,
and treades the pathe to true felicity.
When wit does way the wanton toys of will,
and will does yield to follow wits advice:
And willing wit does learn by wisdoms skill,
of perfect good to know the passing price.
Then worldly toys are all had in despite,
and Heavenly joys are all the hearts delight.
When fancy leaves to follow fond desire,
and wisdom does dame fortunes force defy
And nature does but reasones will require,
and conscience will conceal no treachery.
Then if my mind do not mistake his marks,
the sky will fall, and we shall want no larkes.
The secret suit of a lover.
NOt what I would, yet would I what I wright,
not what I mean, yet mean I what I say:
Not what I might, yet would I what I might,
not what I can, yet will I what I may.
My speech is dark, but you perceive much light,
then mark my words, and guess my meaning right.
For this you know, my tongue so fast is tide,
as for my life I cannot yet speak plain:
Yet do I seek to have my mind descride,
thereby to speak, some liberty to gain.
For if my tongue might tell my tale in kind,
my heart would hope to have some ease of mind.
But oh hard hap, my hope his help denies:
and hope half past despair does drown my mind:
Yet reason shows, that thou in deed art wise,
and ruth reports that I shall favor find,
Which makes me thus in midst of my distress,
in secret sort to sue for some redress.
Of sweet contents.
WHat a^le I wretch? or whereto was I borne?
what means my mind my fancy so to set?
The greatest iemmes I seem to have in scorn,
and daily seek the thing I cannot get.
The reason is, I seek a thing to crave,
which will would wish, but hope can never have.
What, is it wealth? no, many rich I see,
as many seek but few or none can have:
Beauty? oh no, fair ladies many be,
and it is I say no common thing I crave.
What, is it love? tushe love is but a toye,
yet faithful love is sure a heavenly joy.
And therefore Love I cannot choose but leeke,
but lyking looks, and lack breeds discontent,
And they shall find, that do such sorrow seek,
that lothed lack does luckles love lamente.
What is it then whereof I am so feign?
oh it is content I seek, but cannot gain.
Oh sweet content, what one does thee enjoy?
who lives content? alas I least of all:
Content does breed delight without annoy,
content mislykes no fortune that can fall.
Content is that, which few or none can find:
yet must I seek to set at rest my mind.
One that had made his full choice.
MY foolish days, and wanton lusts be past,
in vain you seek (...) me again:
Let be your toys, my thoughts are fixed fast,
Citheria should her self but lose her pain.
Remember not to me wonted delight,
each sweet so past, is now but bitter gall:
Darcknes I (...) that erst I counted light,
my reason is redeemde from fancies thrall.
Apply your selves to set some other snare,
perhaps ye may speed better if ye do:
Such woodcockes many in the world there are,
that will be caught, I am no pray for you.
One has me fast, already hers am I:
Ne will I be another till I die.
A Country Carrolle, translated out of Belaye.
A Crown for Ceres will I make,
of every kind of corn:
With garlandes made of fai^e (...) boughs,
I Bacchus will adorn.
Two pottes of milk to Pales, last
I purpose to present:
That they may hear my humble suite,
and to my will a^ente.
That Ceres may enforce the ground,
a plenteous croppe to yeald:
That Bacchus may the clustred grapes
well prosper in the field.
That Pales so her mantle spread,
upon the pleasant soil:
That grass and wholesome h^rbes may grow
to quite my painful toil.
The same in another sort.
WIth fragrante flowers, with ears of corn,
with leaves that largely grow:
On every vine lets garlands make,
our thankful minds to show.
To Pales, Ceres, sacred dames,
and Bacchus last of all:
Who all our meddowes, fields, and grounds,
when we for grace did call,
With grass, with grain, and grapes so filde,
as they did deem it best:
We fearde no heat, no hayle no cold,
for they our labor blessed.
From all that might the grass, the ear,
or tender branch offend.
The cattle, birds, or greedy goat,
that from the hills descend.
In summer season in the spring,
or Authume did not spoil:
The grass, the ear, the sprouting budde,
but fed on others soil.
Let mowiers then make merry now,
let Reapers all rejoice:
Let vintners vaunte of their good hap,
and all exalte their voice.
To praise the meddowes, fields, and ground,
that gave so great increase:
And laud their name that wrought this work,
else will their goodness cease.
Barnes, garners, sellers, so are heapte,
with hay, with corn and wine:
That never erst the like was see^e.
with any mortal eyine.
An Epigram out of the same Author.
THough false Aeneas now be dead, and Dido laid in grave
yet others left they in their stead, that like co^ditio^s have.
Who with the show of marriage rites, which is a holy thing:
do hide their fleshly fond delights, that folly forth does bring
Verses translated out of the foresaid Poet.
WIth love, with grace, and perfect worthiness,
the powers divine were compassed round about
The sky was clad and cloathd in comely sort,
with burning rays of happy heavenly hew:
All things were full of beutie and of bliss,
the sea was calm, the wind was meek and mild.
When here below the Paragon was borne,
whose fair white skin exceedes the Lilly far,
Whose hair like gold does glister in the sun:
whose lips do stain the perfect crimson die.
From Phoebus beams her shining eyes took shape,
within her breast, the heavens themselves have sown.
And through the Gods, her name immortal bides.
Another.
THe happy branch to Pallas consecrate.
the branch of peace does bear the name of her
Who reaues my sense, and in her beutie shrowdes
such cruelty as most to Mars belongs.
Leave then (thou wilful Dame) leave of I say
this lovely name, or show thy self the like,
That as thou do, in a^l immortal seem,
thy name may seem ordainde by destiny,
What from the heavens, has been bestowed on thee.
is nothing strange nor wonderful to me.
Since thou in mind and heart art Sovereign,
and that thine eyes from those that gaze on thee
Their body, heart, mind, sense, and soul does steal.
Another.
THe self same night wherein the powers divine
From highest heavens beheld the earth below,
Love bente his how to pearce my painful breast:
And made me subject to his Dietie,
The sacred place, from such great cruelty,
Nor yet the time it self could me redeem.
This stroke to heart, did from her eyes descend,
Whilst I too much her glorious face beheld,
I thought at first that Love had leueled,
At both alike, and that one only bond
Had equally together joined us both:
But Love; as blind, and ill aduisde therein,
Has let her go that was the greatest pray,
Detayning me that (...) of least accounte.
Another.
AS none may well with fixed eye behold
The glistering beams of Phoebus golden rays:
So to survey thy (...) passing (...)
Would bleare the eyes, and dimm^ the clearest sight.
And he that shall with fixed eye (...),
Thy glorious face; so shining as it ^oth,
Shall find such ^l^arenes will increase his pain,
And take front him the use of seeing quite:
How can my tongue or (...) be able then,
To painte thy praise, or yealde thy due desarte,
That have no power thy beauty to behold.
Which if mine eyes were able to attain,
I would p^esume to pass the noble bird,
That unto Jove is justly consecrate.
My love shall last.
THe Soldyars wish draws on with wars delight,
the Pilgrims sport lies in his present pain:
Ships (...) the port, and seeks for seas in sight,
and I to smile in love, account it gay^e.
Whom while I serve: wish, sport, and seas I find:
with gallante war, with sport, sea room, and wind
Since now this hap is had, I joy to singe,
what kind of sea, what mates, what ship was there:
How happy chance, by lotte ruled every thing,
the maine sail truth, each wave a friendly tear.
The master, Love him self, sweet sighs the wind:
joys road with Oars, the ship a merry mind.
Fast hope at helm, did wind the boat about,
and fixed faith stood up for middle maste:
The cable hope, which servant twinde throughout,
held gladsome glee, with picked anchore fast,
Beauty discride the rocks, till I was past:
and now beloude, I swear my love shall last.
My love is paste.
THe soldior worn with wars, delights in peace,
the Pilgrim in his ease, when toils are past:
The ship to gain the port, when storms do cease,
and I to smile, now void of love at last.
Whom while I serude, peace, rest, and love I lost:
with greeuesome war, with toil, with seas betost.
But now the brunte is past, I joy to singe,
what kind of sea, what slaves, what ship was there:
How foolish chance, by lotte ruled every thing,
how error was maine sail, each wave a tear.
The master, Love himself, deep sighs the wind:
cares road with vows, the ship vnmerry mind.
False hope at helm, often turnde the boat about,
and fickle faith stood up for middle maste:
Despair the cable twisted round with dout,
held grieping grief the picked anchoare fast.
Beauty was all the rocks, but I at last:
am now twice free, and all my love is past.
Love for virtue, of longest continuance.
THe chiefest care we ought to have,
is to adorn the mind:
With beauty such as best beseemes
and most accordes with kind.
Of greater force this beauty is,
a Ladies love to gain:
Then that which foolish folk commends,
and wise men count but vain,
The love of virtue lastes for aye,
which choice no chance can change:
But love for lust, time turns to naught,
and quickly makes it strange.
When crooked age does once creep in,
brave beauty bids adue:
And then those fondlinges all too late,
their former follies rue.
But virtue bides in perfect plight:
and to the virtuous bringes delight.
Loves Epitath.
HEre lies blind Love, here lies the bedlem boy:
here lies the God, that all the Gods did fear:
Here lies intoumbde, Cithenas greatest joy,
here lies the bow, that Love was wont to bear.
Here lie the shaftes, here lie the piercing darts:
wherewith erewhile, he tamde the stoutest hearts.
Now is he dead, now can he do no more,
no sign appears that he shall live again:
To plague poor souls as he has done before,
and pinch their hearts with strange tormenting pain
Now is he dead, and who the cause but she,
whose blasing beams, blind all the world I see.
Often did he proone and all to none effect,
to force his fire to fasten in her breast*
Her frozen heart did still his flame reiecte,
and made him muse to see his power suppressed.
Deceived so, he knew not what to say:
ne could he judge, the cause of his decay.
To prove his fire, if it had force or no,
unto his wings he put the burning brande,
The fire took hold (for needs it must do so)
then he too late (poor soul) did understand
His fond conceate, and filde the air with cries:
no plaintes preuailde, he died, and here he lies.
At latter gasp a grievous sighe he gave,
and said, farewell ye faithful Lovers all:
Now proof shows plain, what grievous pangs ye have
what force my fire, what power to make you thrall.
I find it now, that felt^ it not before:
but be content, it shall offend no more.
If former faults did merit worthy blame,
the blame is great, I have incurde thereby:
My life must pay my ransom now with shame,
A shameful death, I am at point to die.
My glory gone, my b^anes consumde to dust:
you have your will, abide it needs I must.
In commendation of his Mistress.
I Smile to think how fond conceit.
deceaues the finest wits:
To feed them with a dainty bait,
that choakes them all by bittes.
How fondly some commend the face,
and some the smoothie skin:
And some prefer in highest place,
the tender doubled chinne.
What should I stand to reckon up,
their trashe and trumpery:
That drinks the dregs of every cup,
and praise it to the sky.
Let such go brag them in the crew,
of baser minded swains:
They never came yet where it grow,
nor paid more then their pains.
But if my Mistres would vouchsafe,
her beauty to discover:
Then justly might they frette and chafe,
that so they past her over.
He that triumphs in sweetest blis,
I know then would repine:
No man that saw her, but would wish
oh that she would be mine.
But yet content ye with your choice,
subscribe ye to my saint:
Whose worthy praise no silver voice,
nor pen can fully painte,
Lenuoy.
Let it suffice I live to prove it here:
In all respects she never had her peer.
The despairing Lover.
TO painte the passions of a payned heart,
or show the panges that foolish love constraines.
When honest meaning lackes his due desarte,
the only mean to purchase greater pains.
Alas I rue, because my reason fails.
whilst fond desire, settes up her swiftest sails.
Too swifte in deed, to pass the dangerous seas,
such dangerous seas, as can be hardly paste:
Yet past all help, and hope to purchase ease,
amidst the waves my ^rased bark I cast.
And cast the best, although I count it vain:
till fates accord to send relief again.
A sorrowful Sonette.
IF to the life that ever lastes,
this life a moment be:
If time consume our youthful years,
which we no more shall see.
If every thing that bears breath,
do waste and wear to naught:
Why dreamest thou in prisoned spright?
why do thou take such thought.
Why do thou so detest the day?
and wish the darcksome night.
If to a safer place thou seek,
to take thy speedy flight.
There is the good that every soul
ought chiefly to desire:
There is the rest whereto eachone,
would willingly aspire.
There love does lie, there pleasure dwells,
there, there my soul I say
Amidst the highest heavens thou may
the image well suruay
Of her whose beauty here on earth.
I have adornde from time of birth.
The hurt that grows by gold.
SOme say the golden world is gone,
but I suppose not so:
Now reigns the glistering golden age,
that greatly works our woe.
For gold is now the God on earth,
now gold does govern all:
Gold makes and marres, if gold we want,
in vain for grace we call.
Gold geues and takes from kings their crowns,
gold maintains blooddie war:
Gold bringes the greatest to their graves,
and breeds many a jar.
Gold geues the jack a gentiles name,
and gains him great account:
No fault so foul, but gold afoordes,
gold makes the meanest mount.
Gold is the cause of all our care,
since first this gold was found:
No faith nor frendshippe has been seen
but fraud did most abound.
Oh, wretched gold, would God thy name,
had never here been known:
Then should we not have known the harm,
that by thy name has grown.
He should I now have cause to say
so greatly to my grief:
That want of thee, to win good will,
does make me want relief.
The passions of a Lover.
MY Mistres eyes augment my kindled flame,
her golden locks have caught my captive heart,
Her hurtful hand, my haples fall does frame.
her words bewitch my mind, and breed my smarte.
Her glistering eyes disgrace the brightest star,
her crisped hear surmounts the glorious sun:
Her hands in whitenes, pass the Iuorie far
her witty words immortal fame has won.
Her lovely eyes do much amase my mind,
her golden locks (alas) do link me fast:
Behold my state, behold what hap I find,
no other joy my pyning ghoast could taste.
Since cruel Love, within my breast did shrine:
her eyes, her hear, her hands, her speech divine.
The folly of Love.
ALas I see no hope is left at all,
by serving thee, to set my heart at rest:
Yet from this folly can I never fall,
nor leave thy love, that likes my fancy best.
I am my self, mine own and only foe,
I see the pit, and plunge my self therein,
And though the means be found to ease my woe:
fool that I am, I seek no ease to win.
Though nothing hap, that may my hope advance,
from serving thee yet can I not refrain:
No not though death, or worse, if worse might chance,
this is the good, that I by lot do gain.
I see the best, and know the worst as well:
yet seek the worst, and bid the best farewell.
To his unconstant friend.
ROsetta retchlesse Dame,
since thou have chaungde thy mind:
And in my absence to thy shame,
have shewde thy self unkind.
I have (as well I might)
withdrawn my fond desire:
From fancying one that is so light,
to make such quick retire.
Henceforth for beauties blaze,
where no deserte is found:
I will not set my self to gaze,
so great good will to ground.
This warning may suffice,
to make me wise at last:
Else greater dangers will arise,
then those already past.
But tell when thou have tried,
what good thou gaynste thereby:
Thou wast the first that began to slide,
thy falshode made me fly.
Whilst I with store of tears,
did wail the want of thee:
Thou toauest abroad with ruffeled hear,
and had no mind of me.
Forgetting my good will
thou gave thy self in charge
To such as sought to spoil thee still,
and leftst thy Love at large.
As wavering as the wind,
that alters every hour:
So wavering is thy wandering mind,
whereof thou have no power,
But tell etc.
Where are thy solemn vows,
at parting made to me?
Where are the tears with bended brows,
that then these eyes did see?
Would any man suppose,
such plaints should pass in vain?
From one that only loves to gloss,
and glory in her gain.
O false perjured wight,
accursed shall he be
That in thy doings takes delight,
or puttes his trust in thee.
But tell etc.
The man that holds my place,
and pleades to please the best:
For all his fair dissembling face,
may love thee with the least.
But she whom now I serve,
and honor with my heart:
Above all dames does best deserve,
so prisde by due desarte.
Keep thou thy new come friend,
for I will stick to mine:
We love, and when our likes shall end.
one toumbe our bones shall shrine.
But tell when thou have tried,
what good thou against thereby:
Thou wast the first that began to slide,
thy falsehoode made me fly.
The Lover overcome with sorrow* desires death.
THe more my knowledge grows,
the more my power decays:
To all mishappes my haples life,
is prone at all assayes.
My secret flame augmentes,
amidst my floode of tears:
Before one grief be fully gone,
another straight appears.
Both night and day my thoughts,
are chiefly on my grave:
In darcknes is my most delight,
no mirth my mind can have.
The day dislykes me much,
the ceaseles griefs I taste:
At night when all things else take rest,
my woeful heart does waste.
I never cease to weep,
and yet I know not why:
In this unconstant wavering world*
no truth at all I try.
A monstrous sea it is,
of sorrow, grief, and pain:
Yet no where else can I find means
how I may comfort gain.
Come therefore gentle death,
cut of my line of life:
That by such death, a thousand deaths,
may cease this secret strife*
A Lady lamenteth the death of her lover.
WHy is my crased corpse so strong against my will?
that all the griefs I feel, cannot consume me quite
Who holds my wretched soul, whereas it likes so ill,
And will not let it pass to place of more delight.
Alas since lovely Love, did by his power divine,
Draw both our hearts to him, and make them al as one,
Why have the heavens denide? why do they not incline?
To make our deaths alike, for other men to moan.
The worthy Amphihons wife, whose heart was heapt with grief
To see her children slain, became a senseles stone.
And in that shape as yet, shedes tears without relief.
But by my will this lotte should not be hers alone.
My self would be the like, if safely so I might
Be sure to shrine his bones, whose life was my delight.
A Lover, whose constante mind nothing could alter.
THe proud disdaynes of her unskillful age,
that scoffs at Love, and scorns his Dietie:
The fond desires that do my mind inrage:
and heap my heart with all impyetie.
My death then in her forhead fixte I find,
my silly vessel pressed to pass away:
With broaken maste, torn sail, and stormy wind:
the grievous cares that threaten my decay.
The quenchlesse fire that boyleth in my breast,
the little care she has to cave my rest,
The cureles grief her absence bringes to me,
all this (though great) yet can it not remove:
My steadfast mind that joys in naught I see,
save in her life that lothes my steadfast love.
And makes her mirth, to see me so distressed:
the loving mind turns al things to the best.
A Dialogue between a forsaken lover and diverse Shepherds.
TEll me gentle shepherds, tell me I pray,
as you desire the Driades good grace:
And seek to have God Pan your friend always,
have ye not seen of late pass by this place
A lusty youncker with a gallante Dame.
Shepherds. We saw such two, they poasted hence apace.

Lover. How blessed are ye that bear a shepherds name,
no vain desires may your delights deface.
The force of love, ye fear it not at all,
his piersing darts, do seldom breed your pain.

Shepherds. Sildome indeed, such happes do us befall,
as cause requires, no constante course we make.

Lover. They follow you, from whom your flight you make,
she flies from me, and seeks my blood to spill.
Whom I pursue and honor with my heart:
she lothes my love, I lack my due desarte.

A Lover that had his Mistress always present with him by conjecture.
A Shadow thou, pursuest me every where,
walk where I will, I have thee still in sight:
If in the fields I raunge, I find thee there,
if in the town, thou guydest my passage right.
Awake, asleep, by sea, or else by land,
where so I bide, thy shadow shrowde I still
Within my breast, that at thy mercy stand,
and as thy slave commit me to thy will,
But what said I? a shadow, see my wit,
unseemly, is the smile I seem to make:
To match the white with black, were far unfit,
yet such a match I fondly undertake.
A shapeles thing, a shaddowe is we see,
thou feately framde, well formde in every part:
A shadow foul, and frail as frail may be,
thou fair, and firm, so deemde by due desarte.
In thy sweet face, the perfect marks I find:
of such good gifts, as guide thy modest mind.
The Lover to his eyes.
TOo soon (mine eyes) you did perform your part,
too soon in deed, before my mind was armde:
Or had the skill to fence my feeble heart,
my feeble heart, that fancies ^orte has harmde.
Extreme and strange, not able to be bid,
so are my griefs, such as no tongue can tell,
I seek, but see they cannot well be hid,
nor quite suppressed, so deep in me they dwell.
Great are my thoughts, the greater is my grief,
on sandy soil, I build my fading bower:
No help I have, nor hope to find relief,
such things I seek, as far exceed my power,
One is there yet* may salve this secret sore:
none else but she that gave the hurt before.
One in adversity, comfort him self with the hope of Gods mercy.
WEll may I wail my fate,
since fortune is my foe:
Who bendes her force against my Forte,
and seeks to breed my woe.
Her battery is so strong,
so boystrous are her blows:
That al my strength can scarce withstand,
the rigor that she shows.
The rampires that I raise,
come tombling to the ground:
My strongest bulwarks battered sore,
does all my force confound.
The roaring cannon shot,
comes whirling by mine ears:
And where it hittes it hurts much,
whole houses down it bears,
Enuironde as it were,
with troops of warlike wightes:
My soldiors dare not sally out,
to seek their chief delights,
And yet within God wot,
for want of needful food:
They feel such grief, as better were,
to lose both life and blood.
In these extremes I stand,
and still defense do make:
Desiring rather honest death,
then shameful life to take.
For life is nothing worth,
where honor is defaste:
And death as dear to all such wightes,
as virtues lore embrace.
Although my state be ill,
the staff whereto I stay:
Is God the Lord who gouernes all,
whose will we must obey.
His wisdom far surmountes
the compass of our wit:
He knows that we know nothing of
and geues us that is fit.
By sundry means he seeks,
to win us to his will:
And all he does is for our good,
although we deem it ill.
What he will have preserude,
shall never pearish quight:
Be has a salve for every sore,
and rules all by right.
This is my only hope,
this comfortes all my care:
This makes me think my chance will change,
this does my mind prepare:
To bide the hardest bruntes,
and bear the greatest grief.
That fortunes force or fiercest foes,
or fond affections chief,
Can lay upon my back,
or bring to breed my smarte.
A Fancy.
THe more I see, the more I seek,
the more I seek, the less I find:
The less I find, the more I leeke.
the more I like, the more unkind.
The more unkind, the more my care,
the more my care, the worse my cure:
The worse my cure, the case more rare,
the case more rare, the more unsure.
The more unsure, the sooner lost,
the sooner lost, the lesser stay:
The lesser stay, the greater cost,
the greater cost, the sweeter pray.
The sweeter pray, the more accounte,
the more accounte, the more I crave:
The more I crave, the more I mount,
the more I indunte, the less I have.
Thus do I live in liking still:
I love in vain, and lack my will.
The Lover complains his state,
THe grief that griepes my heart, and moves my trobled mind
Has peareed so through every part, that now no help I find.
What, is it miser I, that sigh and sorrow still:
In soothe I cannot well conceive, my case is grown so ill.
All reason quite removed, no mean remains for me:
To conster such a doubtful case, or judge of that I see.
Then, am I dead in deed? of truth I know not, I:
So void of soul and sense I am, as one at point to die.
Alas what might it be, that does inflame me so:
Were it but fire, my streams of tears, had quenched it long ago.
How may I rightly term, this strange tormenting grief:
No fire, no life, no death it is, and yet it lackes relief.
A dialogue between Reason and the heart of a Lover. Reason.
ABide a while my heart, why do thou haste away?
Heart. I go to seek the lovely eyes, that must my griefs allay.

Reason. I pray thee ^arke a while, my leisure will not serve:

Heart. A feruente fire pricks me forth, and will not let me swerue.

Reason. Alas poor heart, alas, how little is thy skill:
Thou have not yet the sense to see, the end of all thy ill.
Those eyes that so thou seek, will with a glaunce or twain:
To ashes soon convert thee quite, that else might safe remain.
These eyes they are thy foes, then should they succoure thee?

Heart. They are my friends, no foes I find, that will so friendly be.

Reason. Oh this deceaues me most, the subtle birder so
With fained notes deceaues the birds, and seeks to breed their woe.

Heart. Thou much beguilest thy self, or enuiest at my state:
The case is not as thou conceauest, but as I said of late,
The poor unhappy bird, unto her death does fly:
I go to seek those glorious eyes, to purchase life thereby.

The contrarieties in Love.
TO me the night seems short, the day too long,
I fly from love, but follow still his trace:
Unto my self extreme, my self I wrong,
And wronged so, return to thee for grace,
Great are my pains, and yet they please me well,
I see the best, and fondly seek the worst:
Desire draws on, despair does hope expel,
Twixte weal and woe thus is my case accursed.
I prove to run, but prove my proof is vain,
The light seems dark the dark seems light to me:
Though free yet bond I willingly remain,
Youres am I most, mine own I may not be.
My will I wish, but dare not show my suit:
Love biddes me speak, and speaking makes me mute.
The Lover to his bed,
O Bed, o restles bed, and made for ease,
why do thou not perform thy part to me?
To me a plague, why do thou others please?
and please him least that most has need of thee.
I lay me down in hope to rest awhile,
I prove to sleep, and so let slip my grief:
But sower conceits my sweetest joys exile,
and lets the rest that most should lend relief.
The swelling seas, when storms and tempests rise
move not so much as does my troubled mind:
Of this or that so still it does devise,
for every cause a new conceit to find.
Amidst my care this comfort yet I have;
that in my bed when restles I remain:
I may be bold without offense, to crave,
what likes me best, although I crave in vain,
And when I crave, and craving want my will:
May wail my want, and freely weep my fill.
A Lover, whose lady said he was an unfortunate flatterer, writes these
verses for answer thereunto.
IF ever words did wringe me at the heart,
My heart was grieved at that I heard of late:
To let good will be barde for my desarte,
Desaruing love, to find disdainefull hate,
Such is my hap, such is my haples fate.
The heavens have wild, my will must needs obey:
And has no law, the proverb so does say.
Say what I can, it cannot help a whitte,
All that I do, I see is done in vain:
In vain I work, in vain I waste my wit,
In vain I prove to purchase ease with pain.
A silly proof that bringes such sort gain.
Such sort gain, for gold that geues me dross,
Hard is my hap that always live by loss.
By loss I live, by life my self I lose,
I lose my self and yet I live to love:
I love to live, and live to like of those
That fear my fraud, although my faith they prove,
My secret sighs my sorrows cannot move.
Her hardened heart, whose beauty binds me still:
To sue, to serve, to seek, and like her will.
Flatter alas, I would I could do so,
So should my grief be shortly easde thereby:
Truth is my trust, let truthles treason go,
Words are but wind, where words no works do try.
True dealinge was my Sire, plain meaning, I,
Plain as I am, can singe a plain song best:
Best for my soul, small for my bodies rest.
Unfortunate, there did she fit me right,
A righter name she never gave to none?
Fortune my foe, death works me all despite,
But let her spite, she spightes not me alone.
Besides my self, she spightes at many a one*
One is there yet, which only one am I:
That fear not fate but fortunes force defy.
Like he that list her false dissemblinge looks,
Seek who so will her fair entysing baits:
In such sweet shows I see unsavory hooks,
Which warnes my wit to shun her sweet conceits,
Who hopes for hap vnhapie wretch he waightes.
Her cursed cup that will his mind infecte,
And work his woe ere he the worste suspecte.
Suspecte not yet though I suspend my chance,
That any chance can change my constante mind:
The hardest hap shall most my hope advance,
And make me hope although no hap I find.
My heart has vowde my vow her virtues bind:
To bide her own and only hers to be,
Whose sight lendes light, whose light lends life to me.
The tormented lover that durst not reveal his state.
A Happy life I led and liude at ease,
When pricked with love I would at lardge complain:
And to the flame that fed my fond disease,
Give vent at will to help my present pain,
But now (aye me) my wretched case is such,
As s^ase I can permit a sighe to pass:
To ease my heart that has been chardgd too much,
With change of griefs that wax a heavy mass:
I love, and yet I dare not say I leeke,
Tormented still, I seem to live content,
Consumde with care, I can no comfort seek,
Such is my state, so is my fancy bente.
But though I plain, my plaintes are much the less,
The less my grief, though little be my joy:
Because I feel, and find this sower success,
From sweet desire does spring and spread annoy.
Yet let me see, some comfort have I more,
More then I thought, to comfort me withal:
Amidst my griefs, that growing grieve me sore:
This only grace, unto my lotte does fall,
To write at night, the words I fear to tell:
When wanting ink, salt tears do serve me well.
A dialogue between the Lover and Love. Love.
Love. O Love, when wast thou borne? When every leaueles tree
And parched soil began to spring, a seemly sight to see.

Lover. Who brought thee forth at first?

Lo. The nurce of all annoy.
Even idleness, the plague to man, and end of all his joy.

Lover. Who gave thee all this power, to war with worldly wights?

Love. An ardent hope, a cold despair, that lets your chief delights.

Lover. Where do thou harbor most?

Lo. In young and tender hearts
That tirant-like, I still tormente, with store of piercing darts.

Lover. Yet tell, who trainde thee up?

Lo. Sweet beauty only she:
To whom both youth and vanity, obedient servants be.

Lover. What is the chiefest food thou feedest thy self withal:

Love. A fair clear light which ledes me forth, and seldom lets me fall

Lover. Fear thou the length of time, that alters all things quite?
Or do thou doubt the dinte of death, that dau^ts the worthiest wight

Love. No, no, I Way the^ not, for though they change my state,
I take my rest, and turn again, to that I was of late.

The humble petition of a passionate Lover.
MAke me to live, (sweet mistres) make me live,
exchange my chance, make mirth of mourning cheer
Exchange my death, a lasting life to give,
so work my heart, so weak whilst thou art here
That when my soul shall from my body fly:
it may else where, a better place supply.
Make me to live that at the instant hour,
when thy sweet eyes I shall assaye to touch
Both sense and sight may want there wonted power.
that in thy arms whom I esteem so much
My pyning corse may mildely pass away:
and of my life make this the latest day.
Join both our souls, join both our souls in one,
link both our hearts in bands of like good will:
Make both our minds to match in mirth or moan,
let our self law lead our affections still,
So let our thoughts, our words and works agree:
as if I liude in thee, and thou in me.
Forbid me not thy lips that like me well,
deny me not thy bosom for my due:
Those lovely beams where love him self does dwell
those blazing beams, that scarce mine eyes can view,
Vouchsafe (sweet heart) that sweetly I may kiss:
and by such sweetenes turn my bale to bliss.
Naught that I have, can I accounte mine own,
naught that thou have, in right thou recknest thine:
Mine eyes are thine, as all my deeds have showen,
even so thine eyes, they are or should be mine.
My heart is thine, thy heart is due to me:
so love allows, if so our lyking be.
Thou art my fire, and I thy kindled flame,
I am thy soul, be thou my soul again:
Embrace thine own, and so avoid the blame,
thou may incur by showing proud disdain.
Link fast our lips, that so with like delight:
we may exchange our souls, our sense, and sight.
So let us change, as by our change we may
be more assured of that we most misdoubt:
And not by changing, change that chance away,
that might perchance, be better brought about.
My seeking is that such exchange should make:
our doubtful love, a deeper root to take.
So is my wish, and so I hope it will,
so may I live a most contented life:
So shall I find to please my fancy still,
so may my state be ever free from strife.
So shall I think my self, the happyest man:
that ever liude since first my life began.
The changeable state of Lovers.
Whom love has made obedyent to his law,
does every hour exchange his shape anew:
I proved it well, that long have liude in awe,
and often chaungde, the more my chance I rue,
First to a heart, a woeful wounded heart,
I was transformde then to a silly swanne:
That singing shewde his death without desarte,
next to a flower whose color soon waxt wan.
At last alas, a Fountain was I made:
as soon dried up, for from my blubbered eyes
The water flowed, till all began to fade:
and now the beast I am, in flame that fries,
But yet ere long, I hope a voice to be:
to vaunte of her, that makes no count of me.
The vanity of Lovers.
SInce griefs increase, since this my quenchles fire,
Consumes me still, alas what boots it me
To say and swear, I will with speed retire,
And never loves, her lovely face to see.
Since when I want (poor wretch) her wished sight,
Her wished sight, the cause of all my care:
New cares begins to cut of all delight,
And break my vows, so snarlde in Cupids snare.
Who Tyrant-like (alas) the more my pain,
Within her eyes has pleasant poysone plaste:
The sight whereof, does search through every vain,
And helpeles quite, my fainting heart does waste.
Thus am I forste, though sore against my will:
To seek and leeke, the cause of all my ill.
FINIS.
