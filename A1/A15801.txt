THE TRVE USE OF ARMORIE, Showed by History, and plainly proved by example:
the necessity thereof also discovered: with the manner of differings in ancient
time, the lawfulnes of honorable funerals and moniments: with other matters of
Antiquity, incident to the aduauncing of Banners, Ensigns, and marks of
nobleness and cheualrie, By William Wyrley.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS AND OTHERS THE professors of martial
discipline.
NOBLES and Gentlemen, I will salute you with a sentence of mine Author sir
John Froysard, The adventures of arms (says he) are so diverse, and so far
oftentimes beyond expectation, as that their effects causes great admiration:
which saying of his caused me with the more attention to read over his works,
and finding the same most truly prosecuted through the whole course of his
history, but especially in the actions and adventures of two famous Capitains
Sage and Imaginatiue, the one sir John Chandos, and the other sir John Grayllie
by name (commonly called the Captall de Buz) it delighted me (as a lover of
honor and cheualrie) to note down their several fortunes with some reasons of
their falls, as men may guess at the judgments of God, and having enterprised
the publishing thereof, have dedicated these my labors, such as they be, to
your honorable society: which doings of mine though they may seem to some men
frivolous and not worth your regard, yet doubt I not but you shall find
matter of benefit valuable to the time you shall therein bestow, both by way of
imitation, and virtuous aemulation, as being a subject that may stir your
worthy endeavors to the honor of God, your dutiful service of her Majesty,
the benefit of your country, and your own eternal glory. I have been
careful to set down (as my manner is) the Standards pennons, cote armours, and
other marks of honor, to the end it may publicly be known of what necessity
the use of them is (as being for that cause first ordained) how and in what
manner they are to be used, and to whom they do of right most chiefly and
properly appertain and belong. And these matters being well conceived (as
indeed without such tokens no martial discipline can be exercised, no army
ranged, no attempt of any company achieved, and so (by consequence) no
conquest made, nor so much as any Commonwealth (whatsoever) defended, neither
from outward enemies, civil discord, nor the rebellion of any plebeian rout,
be the same never so simple, rude, or of small esteem) it will (I hope) reduce
into estimation a matter both of honor, order, and necessity, which now
(through the abuse thereof) is so far run into contempt, as that (of many men)
it is holden for a thing of no price, but thought to be a very mockery, and a
matter of no other sequence, than to set up vain and fantastical glorious
fellows into a pride, and to draw from them some small sums to certain
persons into an office instituted, which no doubt was by the wisest and best
governed states at the first devised, and generally by all of any policy
received to a most necessary end: yet think they (as it is now in use) it
serves but only for that purpose. And indeed I must by the way complain,
that certain of the said officers (or others pertaining to them) either for
want of skill or maintenance, or otherwise for their gain, have committed
faults not justifiable, whereby they have brought a matter of great honor into
defame, and injured thereby the Commonwealth, and brought both others that have
managed those affairs with more discretion, and themselves into obloquie. But
these faults and errors, and some others also (spoken of in this dedication
instituted to that purpose) will in the handling of this matter more easily
appear, and the thing be (I hope) reformed either by the good endeavors which
the officers (understanding thereof) will use, or else by the magistrate, when
he shall have knowledge of such the abuses as he may be informed of. And first
that Guydhomes ensigns and marks of armorie be of necessity, let it be but
considered whether wars be sometimes of necessity to be taken in hand or not,
and surely I think there is none of so very mean capacity, but will yield
unto it that they be: especially defensive, and in some cases also offensive:
which as a thing granted I will ouerpasse. And then I say further, that wars
being lawful and of necessity, it must also be granted, that the same must be
made by companies and bands of men, over which some must command, and the rest
obey, and then will it follow, that for the oredring and dividing of those to
the best advantage, standards and banners must be allotted to every company,
to the end they may draw together in their strength, and perform such actions
as they shall be commanded, thus may you see the necessity. And for the use it
does also appeer, that sithence some must be commanders, it is of importance
that they be known both by the persons over whom they command, and generally by all, and that so perspicuously that upon every sudden occurrent, the meanest and
simplest common soldier may thereby know every particular officer, and
captain that has charge: for which purpose our ancestors devise was, that
such men should wear some such coat of mark over his armor, as whereby they
might be easily discerned, to be the same persons which indeed they were: and
where sometimes (when occasion so offered it self) they were forced to use
pauishes for their defense, whereby a great part of the mark which was upon
their vesture, was shadowed from sight, it was thought necessary that their
marks should be also laid upon their shieldes: the commanders of horsemen
(their faces being for the most part covered) they added to the crests of their
helmets some further distinction to be the better also known by: thus much for
the ordinance and use of armorie. And hereby also may it appear to whom they
do properly belong and appertain, namely, to Kings, Princes, Archbishops,
Bishops, Earls, Barons, Lords of provinces and fees, Knights, officers in the
Army, Navy or piece, and generally to all that have charge over bands and
companies of soldiers. And now sithence from henceforth many of my speeches
will tend to the discovery of such things as I take to be abused, erroneous,
or faulty, wherein I may peradventure not square in opinion with some others,
and being my self no officer or of any authority, whereby I should have cause
to deal in these affairs, I will therefore first beseech your honors and all
others to whom it may appertain, that if any thing shall pass my pen which
shall be offensive, that they will conceive no worse of it then I mean, which
is but to bring these matters of armorie into question, to the end that if
any thing be amiss (as I for my part think that many things are) that then
the same may be reformed: but if happily I mistake, that then it would please
such as be of judgment or skill, to justify the same as well done, and I
shall most willingly yield to authority and reason: and so not speaking but
under correction, I say that first I find (as I conceive) some blame to be
imputed in your selves which be professed soldiers, that where your ancestors
and al others generally did in their standards, banners, and pennons show
forth to the view and face of the enemy, certain fair, ancient, and known
marks, which their elders for the most part had usually before time carried,
or at least themselves had then taken (if they but then were in their rising
age) whereby their own people were in a goodly and decent order conducted and
led, and their enemies very much terrified, when they should see those marks
showed forth, the owners whereof had in their memories by plain feat of arms
overthrown their parents, or happily themselves, beaten them out of the
field, razed down their castles and fortresses, sacked their towns and
cities, wasted and spoiled their countries, ransomed their people, and
generally so daunted and amazed them, that it was sometimes found to be true,
that very bare names of some valiant persons overcame whole armies. I can not
but blame you of all sorts which shall make choice of banners (which you call
colors) so curtein like and so far from all due order of Ancient bearing as may
be, and for your parts which are descended from Ancestors of mark, I would be
glad to hear any reason from you, to what end you should lay the same a side,
and make choice of a curtein in the place thereof. And you others (whose
wisdom and valor have gained you the reputation of a charge) I would gladly
also hear from you what should move you to be of that mind, as not to take
some convenient mark, such a one as may be thought meet by authority for you,
whereby you may gain an honor, both to your selves and your posterity, and by
your good usage thereof much enlarge the reputation, you have by your valors
obtained.

An other thing that is amiss as I take it, and has great need to be
reformed, is the quartering of many marks in one shield, coat, or banner, for
sithence it is true that such marks serve to no other use but for a commander
to lead by, or to be known by, it is of necessity that the same be apparent,
fair, and easy to be discerned, so that the quartering of many of them
together does hinder the use for which they are provided. As how is it possible
for a plain unlearned man (who may be as good a soldier in some respects as
the best) to discern and know a sunder, six or eight, (what speak I of six or
eight?) sometimes thirty or forty several marks clustered all together in
one shield or banner, nay though he had as good skill as Robert Glouer late
Somerset that dead is, and the eyes of an Egle, amongst such a confusion of
things, yet should he never be able to decipher the errors that are daily
committed in this one point, nor discern or know one banner or standard from
another, be the same never so large? So that except it be to be made in a
pedigree or descent to lock up in an evidence chest, thereby to show men's
titles to their lands or the Alliences and kindreds of their houses, otherwise
(as I say) I see not to any use in the world they serve, specially so many
together to be made upon a man's vesture, Target or banner, and therefore I
could wish that every man would content himself with his own peculiar coat
of name, and not to use above one quartered therewith at the most: which one
yet does not so much trouble the capacity of a man, but that he may both know
and discern a banner or shield well enough. And this one do I the rather
esteem well of to be borne, for that a Prince or Noble man making challenge or
title to any Country (for which he is forced to make wars before he can
obtain it) it will be a goodly thing for him to show forth his standard of
the Arms of that Country quartered with his own amongst those people which
in reason and conscience owe him duty and obedience, to the end that they may
thereby be the sooner induced to submit themselves to their true and lawful
sovereign, as his subjects. And for that cause (as I take it) King Edward the
third and his valiant sons devised and showed forth the Arms of France and
England quartered together, and although my Author says that Jacques Dartuell,
a honey trier of Gaunt was the first deviser thereof, yet will I not believe
otherwise, but that the principal reasons that led the king thereto, was to
make known the iustnes of his title to that kingdom where he then intended to
make wars. But now it may be objected, sithence a Prince or great Lord may
have title to several Countries, that therefore it is necessary for him to
bear all such tokens or marks as he has title too: To this I answer, that
although I could yield to them (but that it will bring the confusion aforesaid)
yet is it of no such necessity, for that a man needs to show his title but
only to them whom he means to subdue: and if it should fortune that he had
title to diverse and several Countries, and that he would make wars to them
all at once, yet should it not be needful to him to show forth any more marks
quartered in one standard, but only unto every several country the Arms of
that nation quartered with his own. But this being the case of Kings and
Princes, wherein (amongst others) our most famous, noble and worthy kings and
princes of this land, have showed themselves most prudent and wise, to what
purpose is it that others being but commanders under their prince, and which of
themselves have neither title to country nor are able to maintain wars,
should in their princes service pester their banners and shields with such an
infinite number as many do? And in this point I cannot enough commend the Baron
of Stafford, who heerin shows his great skill and temperance, for althongh
his Ancestors have had title to quarter the marks of that valiant Thomas of
Wodstocke (yoongest son of King Edward the third) Earl of Buckingham and
Duke of Gloucester, of Bohune Earl of Hereford and Northanton and high
Cunstable of England: and also of that great house of Somerset, which by their
ancestor John Earl of Somerset, (yoonger son to John of Gaunt) descended
from the same king Edward the third, (I omit to speak of diverse Barons and
others of great estate, whose heirs both with revenue and honor enlarged
greatly his family) yet the said Baron contents himself with the paternall
mark of his house, and never so much as dreams of any other, far differing
from a number of meaner persons, who if they possess any manor or lands by
descent, albeit their ancestors married the heir of the same many hundred
years agone, and whose parents peradventure never did bear any mark, or if
they did (time having obscured the same) it remains unknown: yet shall you
have them run to an Herald or painter, as busily as if the matter were of
weight, and there make search they know not for what, and the herald or painter
(on the other side) to draw some small piece of silver from them, will find out
the badge of some one or other of the same name, although many times none of
the kindred, and may be never came near that country, and that will they
inuest them with as their own, and sometimes (when no mark for any of the
name will be found) then devise some conceit or other, and say they find it
borne by such a name, and content them wonderously therewith, which serves yet
to no other use, but to make up a just number, whereby their own marks become
the more confused: and yet into this quartering (being a very fountain of
errors) many both Noble men and Gentlemen, and the officers of Arms
themselves, do oftentimes very rashly enter. It is not long sithence there died
a knight in Staffordshire of good account, and (in his life time) was a deputy
Lieuetenant there, to do his obsequie came an officer of Arms, who compiled
for him nine several marks all in one Escuchion, and yet never a one of them
(as they were there set forth) to him belonging, but his own of name. And as
I have given you this one for an instance, so almost can a man come into no
town of any account, nor almost into any Church or house of Noble man or
Gentleman, but he shall find errors, so that the numbers thereof be infinite:
It were therefore to be wished that this matter of quartering should be
reformed, as well for the untruths therein committed, as for the titles that
may be brought in question thereby to lands and Heritages: And as being one of
the chiefest things that brings the honor of Armory into disgrace: for not
long ago heard I one speak in this manner, did I not (quoth he) know the
grandfather of this man (speaking of the owner of a scuchion wherein were
quartered many marks) to purchase by plain patent (although he never were man
at Arms) both his coat and crest within these forty years, and how comes it
now to pass that I see his nephew invested in all this Armorie? (numbering many
and diverse several devices all in one shield by way of quartering) this being
a very mockery to see a man of no valor or estimation in warlike affairs,
and the paternall Ancestors of whom (for ought that can be proved) were not in
any late age welders of Arms, to entrude themselves into so many badges of
Armorie is not the least matter to bring into contempt an order so honorable
and necessary, as the bearing of Arms is.

Another matter that to my understanding is also to be reformed, is the manner
of differings, which are by the yoonger brothers and their posterities laid
upon their marks, being cressants, mollets, etc. and that such little ones, as
that a man cannot discern them a very small distance from him, which
differences are in reason to be made fair, plain, and large, that they may be
also as easy to be discovered as any other devise that is in the coat,
shield, or banner, otherwise they serve not to the purpose for which marks were
first ordained. And the inconvenience which ensues of this error will the more
easily appear, if I but set you down the words of mine Author (treating of an
accident that happened in such a case) which be these: Et feist msr Robert
Baileul aler sa Banniere tout deuant en escriant moriannes les Henuiers qui
inestoint esthauses Aperceurent la Banniere de moriannes qui encore estoit tout
Droicte, si cuiderent que ce feust la leur ou ilz se deuoient radresser, car
mult petite y auoi^ de difference de lune a l'autre, car les Arms moriennes
sount Bars contre Bars d'Argent and d'Azure a deux Cheuerons de Gueules, et
le cheuron de msr Robert auoit vne petite crosete d'or, si ne l'aduiserent mye
bien les hennuiers ainsi vindrent bouter de fait dessubs la Banniere de msr
Robert, si furent moult fierement reboutes et tous discomfis: For these
henowers being led by sir William Baileul thought in the stir and business to
have come to his banner hearing the surname of Moriens called upon, and seeing
as they supposed their captains ensign, and the difference of sir Robert,
being the yoonger brother, but a little cross upon the upper cheuron they
could not apperceaue, so that the most of them were either slain or taken, and
the elder brother the Knight their leader was glad to save himself as well as
he might: The Lord of Cowcie son in law to king Edward the third, suffered
also reproach through the hard dealings of the Lord of Chine who raised his
banner against certain Englishmen of sir Hugh Caueleys company, being either
the same that Cowcies was, or the difference so small as might not be
discerned, whereby the said Lord Cowcie though he were absent as far as
Austrich, had dishonor spoken of him as in the discourse of the Capital I have
touched.

Thus then having showed by example the harm and inconvenience that cannot but
many times happen through the littlenes and nicenes of such differences, I have
thought it not amiss to lay before you the differings that antiquity used,
that by comparing them together you may discern the great wisdom of our
ancestors and our own imperfections in this point, for want of due
consideration: which was done at the first by changing of the devise borne into
other colors only, but when that would not suffice for the number of leaders
(many times all of one house) then were they forced to vary their marks by
adding of either bars, bends, cheurons, cheefes, quarters, borders, labels,
losinges, or such like, and very seldom should you see in those times
cressant, mollet, or such like small little thing borne for a difference, and
if any did, yet was the same made so large and fair that it might be seen as
well as any other the devise which should be in the shield or banner. And for
the proof, I will give you the example but of one house only for your better
information (though I could do the like of many others) namely, that of the
Bassets, who indeed (in my judgment) varied their marks of honor very
finely, and that upon good respect:

For Ralph Basset (the son of Thurstine who came in with the Conqueror)
which Ralph (as it it said) devised the Law of Frank pledge, and many other
good laws, being Iusticiarius Angliae, having four sons, to wit, Thurstine,
Thomas, Richard, and Nicholas, the first and last both failing, the issue of
the one being extinct, and the other overthrown by standing against king
Henry the second with king Steven: The son of Thomas went away with his
ancestors mark without distinction (being vndie gold and red.)

But the sons of Richard Basset being advanced by their mother Mauld, the
daughter and heir of Sir Geffrey Rydell knight, varied the marks of the said
Geffrey in this manner: first, Geffrey Lord of Witering the eldest son of
Richard Basset and the said Mauld, (surnaming himself Rydell) the progeny of
him bare gold three pals red, with a scarffe or bend of blewe over all.

Ralph Basset the eldest son of Richard, which Richard was the second son
of Richard and Mauld Rydell, and to whom his mother gave the Baronie of Weldon,
bare gold three pals red, a border of steel studded with gold compassing the
same about.

Also Ralph Basset, the son of Ralph, third son of Richard Basset and
Mauld, to whom the said Richard gave the Baronie of Drayton in Staffordshire,
bare gold three pals red, with a quarter of Britain.

And Roger Basset of Warwickshire varied from Drayton, changing the pals into
black.

But Ralph Basset (descended from Williliam Basset Baron of Sapcote in
Leicestershire, which William was Justice in Itinere, and yoongest son of
Richard Basset and Mauld Rydell his wife) (having no advancement by the house
of Rydell) detained vndie the devise of the Bassets, and only changed the
colors thereof into silver and black:

And Sir Ralph Basset of Chedle knight (a yoonger son of Sapcote) varied from
that house, by adding to his devise of waves, a red Labell, whereunto he was
forced by reason the progeny of Thomas Basset had many ways varied the said
vndie, by changing the color thereof.

As John Basset of North Luffenham in Rutlandshire bare it, varied into white
and red:

And Allen Basset Baron of Wicombe, differed this devise of vndie into white
and blew, from whom the Sanfords descending assumed the same mark, and now
Browning bears it as being descended from an heir of Sanfords.

The house of Chedle yet after this dividing it self into two branches, John
Basset of new place (being of the yoonger house) left the Labell, and charged
the black vnds with many besants dispersed all over them.

But after all this (about the time of king Edward the third) the line of Ralph
Basset of Chedle being extinguished: Simon Basset Baron of Sapcote (descended
from the forenamed William) and sir John Basset of Blore knight, (heir to the
above named John Basset of new place) both of them (I know not the cause why)
at one instant (as I think) relinquished their devise of vndie, and invested
themselves into ridels: that is to say, Simon into the pals charged with a
quarter varrie white and blew, and sir John into the same, with a quarter
silver, and a black Griffon thereon.

And in Tamwoorth Church (near to Drayton) well and old there stands gold
three pals red, a quarter silver and a cross patie black thereon.

Thus have I set down unto you (though something tediously) the use that the
antiquity followed in a very glorious line, for Lords, Knights and Gentlemen,
which flourished diverse hundreds of years sithence, and you may see that these
men (though they were many of them great Barons) were not ashamed of their
differences, but laid them forth largely to the view, neither do I esteem it
a shame whereby any man should covet to hide the same, to be descended as a
yoonger brother, sithence that every brother (having the like parents) is as
well descended as the eldest, and therefore as good a Gentleman (though not so
rich) as he. And the more is his honor, if without the help which by reason of
his patrimony the elder has, he can advance himself into place of office or
dignity, whereby he may raise an other flourishing family of the same surname:
And therefore you my masters that be yoonger brothers, never hide your
differences by putting forth a little cressant, or a peeping mollet, but use
some fair large devise, sithence in truth your estimation is by your rising to
be had in as good a regard as if you were the elder.

And now being in speech of yoonger brothers and their differences, I have
observed two kinds of them which the antiquity used, (besides the aforesaid)
one was, that such as were advanced by Kings, Princes, or other great Lords,
did many times bear some part of the devise of him who advanced them, by way
of addition unto the mark of their own family, which served very aptly to
distinguish them from their elder house.

The other was, that diverse did add unto the mark of their own house, some
part of the devise of that family from which their mothers descended, and both
these two kinds of differings are (in my mind) greatly to be commended, not
only for that they may be made large and apparent, and for that cause serve
very properly to the use for which Badges are ordained, but also that the one
makes manifest a grateful mind (in him that is advanced) to his prince or
lord of whom he received benefit, and by reason thereof linketh them together
in a kind of amity, which seldom or never is worn out, and by that means a
great strengthening it is unto both houses.

The other not only serves to unite the families which have matched together
in the foresaid love and amity, and thereby works the like effect, but
besides it shows the certainty of the dessending of the said yoonger brother
out of both the said houses, and also gives knowledge of the time thereof,
whereby if any title of inheritance be at any time cast upon the yoonger
brother, either descending from ancestor of the fathers side, or mothers, it
gives him a testimony of his title, and witnesses unto the world the truth of
his descent by the continual bearing of that devise, so that this kind may
(many times) work profit to the bearer, and avoid many troubles and suits: and
therefore into one of these kind of differings could I wish our yoonger
brothers, which from henceforth shall be advanced, to inuest them selves, as
being both honorable, fair, certain, and profitable. But now it may be
objected that the order in use shows plainly enough the diversity of
brothers, as the cressant a second, the mollet the third, that by this means
the matters are made certain: to this I answer, that first the time is not
(by this means) signified, neither can it be known which of the Cressant
bearers was the uncle or nephew. And further it is a very usual matter for
every new Riser at this day, if he can find that there is any of the like
Surname that bears mark, presently to usurp the same with a Cressant or
some such difference, so that (for my own part) I do seldom credit such kind
of differinges nor their bearers, unless it be by some other testimony or proof
made manifest, which cannot be counterfetted so well in the other devise,
except the riser should be thoroughly acquainted with the descent of him whose
line he seeks to intrude himself into, and besides, it may be the sooner
espied by them of the true line and forbidden, nor the other dare (for fear
thereof) so soon venture the committing of a falsitie. But what a confusion is
it when you shall see the second of a second brother, and sometimes an other
second from him, to cluster one Cressant upon an other, many times three or
four, one on horseback upon an other, where as by the aforesaid bearing of
the difference from the Prince, Lord, or mothers family, a man may better
distinguish the brothers and set down for a second, a third, and fourth, etc.
And after from those again, in a fairer, larger, and more apparent manner: And
the more apt am I to speak against these ordinary differences (as they are
called) knowing them to be but new inventions, and any of them as ordinaries
(in fashion as now they are) never used before the time of King Henry the
sixth, before which time men were much more wary and discreet in bearing of
their marks, and in foreseeing that no intruders should enter into their
families, nor that any should lay away or remove their differings without
special warrant or license of them that thereby might be prejudiced: for a
Labell being much in use for the heir apparent (to wear as his difference
during his fathers life) was seldom removed to the second brother, but when
the inheritance went unto the daughters of the elder brother, and then the
second was permitted to bear the same for his difference, as being the heir
male of his family and as one that remained in expectancie, yet might not the
second brother use to intrude himself into the absolute signs of his house
(the inheritance being in his neeces or kinswomen) as appeared in the case
between Gray of Ruthine and Hastings which was this:

John Lord Hastings married to his first wife Izabell one of the sisters and
heirs of Almerie de vallence Earl of Penbrooke, by whom he had issue John
Hastings (after Earl of Penbrooke) Elizabeth (married to Roger Lord Gray of
Ruthin) and some other children which needs not to be spoken of, for that (as I
take it) all the lines of them failed before the extinguishing of the line of
the said John Earl of penbrooke: after (such issue being had) the said Izabell
Vallence died, and the said John Lord Hastings took to a second wife Izabell
the daughter of Hugh Spenser, by whom he had issue Hugh Hastings, and Thomas,
and then died, and left as heir John his son by his first wife (who was Earl
of Penbrooke as I have said, erected by reason of his mothers inheritance)
which John Earl of Penbrooke married and had issue an other Earl of
Penbrooke, who also married and had issue a third Earl of Penbrooke, but in
the end all the line of the said John Hastings (first Earl of Penbrooke of
that family) failing, there arose a question betwixt the heirs of Roger Gray
and Elizabeth his wife being sister (of the whole blood) and the heirs of Hugh
Hastings brother (of the half blood) to the said John Earl of Penbrooke, for
the inheritance of the Hastings. But Gray recovering the same (by the law that
says, Possessio fratris de feodo simplici facit sororem esse haeredem) called
the said Hastings also (having removed the difference of his mark for that he
was then heir male of that house) into the Court of cheualry, and there having
a judgment against him, the said Hastings was compelled to use a difference
(which was a Label of silver) upon his mark, a fair red sleeue of his Ladies
upon his golden vesture: Since which the heirs of that yoonger family have
used the said Labell even until this our age. So that you may see by this that
the law was then taken to be such, that such an heir male as had not the
inheritance of his Ancestors should not be suffered to bear his mark without
distinction, for it should seem (by this) that the issue of them that had
married the heir general of any family (being by reason thereof possessed of
the lands) had not only an interest in the Arms, but might also forbid any
man the bearing thereof: and moreover it would also appear that the law was
then supposed to be such, that the owner of every mark might dispose of the
same, as of his lands and inheritance, and that the Donee had power (by virtue
of such gift) to use the same as his own proper Armorie, for I have seen a
deed importing thus much: A tous y ceux qui Cestes le^res verrount au orro unt
Thomas le fytz monsr John de Herovill Chr. Salutz en deuyn Sachetz moy auoir

And for proof that the said grant was not made without warrant of law
authorizing the same, the said Roger Wyrley although he and diverse others his
ancestors bare other arms as proper to their own family long before the said
time, as may appear by diverse and sundry pieces of evidence sealed with the
same, dated many years before this grant: yet did the said Roger use and bear
the said cote by Heronvile to him granted by virtue of the said deed, after the
same was to him granted, as by diverse seals and other moniments thereof may
appear, so that the use concurred with the grant, and therefore not to be
doubted but that the law did then take the said grant to be good and vailable.
And for a further proof, amongst diverse I will give you one other testimony,
and so leave to trouble you any more in this point.

And this law (I think) was grounded upon this reason, that forasmuch as every
tenant that held lands by a knights fee was tied to do his Lord escuage or
shield service proportionable to the tenure he held, it is agreeable unto
equity that he may give or leave his Armor to such a person, as he means to
make owner of his heritage, whereby he shall be bound to the same service that
himself by the said law was charged to do, as having with the mark
maintenance answerable thereto. And that this matter was of regard in my
Authors time, it appears by the request both of sir John Chandos himself,
made to the Prince of Wales (as in the discourse of him I have touched) and of
sir Thomas Trivet (a gallant soldier of that time) speaking to the Earl of
Buckingham, being rested before the city of Troys in France, (in this manner)
the words of my Author concerning this matter be these: Et msr Thomas Trivet
apporta sa banniere toute enueloppe deuant le County de Bucquenham et lui did
monseigneur sil vous plaist ie desuelopperay au iourdui ma banniere car deu
mercy iay asses de revenue pour maintenir estate comme a la banniere
appartient: il nous plaist bien respondit le count, etc. so that by this the
thing is manifested, for that the chiefest reasons whereby they thought to
induce (the one) the Prince, and (the other) the Earl, to give them leave to
raise their banners, was, that they had sufficient revenue to maintain the
estate that to a banner did appertain. And it may also appear, that it is not
necessary for any to have marks, but such as be warfaring men, having either
revenues to maintain soldiers, or at least a charge, or some office pertaining
to men at arms under their Sovereign: which thing if it were performed
according to reason, there should not need so many mollets and cressants for to
distinguish yoonger brethren, for that none but such as meddled with warlike
affairs have need of Armore, and they (I doubt not) would for their own
necessity be forced to use some more large and apparent devise than such
little ones, as be now (of no value) in use.

There is also another matter out of square, which is, that every man that
obtains large possessions (whether the same be acquired by his judgment in
law, traffike in merchandise, or any other mean) yea although never any of his
progenitors (from whom he can derive himself) had the charge to lead men of
arms, will yet at this day intrude themselves into the badges and marks of
soldiers: for although such as be descended from men of martial discipline,
have an interest in their ancestors marks (amongst other their goods) and
therefore may show forth the same to their predecessors glory, and their own
(in respect of their descent) yet such men as rise by their sciences,
judgments, or skill in other arts, affairs, or trades (although they be to be
reverenced for their wisdom and praisefull actions, and had in honor
answerable to their virtues and dignities) have yet little to do with the marks
or badges of soldiers. For although a reverent Judge that has ministered law
and justice a long time (and that so long as that thereby to his great glory)
he has obtained reputation, wealth, and revenue, is to be had in high
estimation, and in respect thereof to have allowed him some note or mark of
honor fit for his calling, yet (to my simple judgment) the same should be
disposed unto him after the old Roman order by signifying the manner of his
rising, rather than to put a corselet on his back, a burgonet on his head, a
target on his arm, and a sword by his side, being things that would cumber
greatly the good old man to use, either for his own defense, or but to show
(by way of triumph) for his glory, sithence neither is it tolerable (by reason
of his age) nor in his youth did he exercise himself in welding thereof. And
as these things are unseeming for him to wear, no more can I see any reason
why he should deck up the moniments of his house with such signs or tokens,
except he can derive himself from an ancestor that has had the use of such
things, and then (to set them forth as a glory to his deceased parent) will
greatly augment the regard of his rising, which rising yet (of it self) is a
sufficient honor, the same being by any just, virtuous, or laudable means. And
these new risings I could wish to be of more reputation than they seem to be
esteemed of, either by others, or themselves that so rise, as is apparent by
many of their doings, who intrude themselves into marks of Antiquity, and
setting forth of descents, wherein they are yet feign many times either to
counterfeit, or else to derive themselves from some poor parents, which they
(either truly, or by surmize) allege to have descended from some ancient
family, and that have been by some accident or other in former time decayed:
wherein me thinks men do greatly mistake the matter, for that (in my opinion)
a man that is but of mean parentage and rises by commendable means, is
equivalent to him that rises from a decayed family, namely when his said
parent has been overthrown for offense, as many times they allege (in plain
terms) which yet is to be understood although it were never spoken of, for
that God in his justice (seldom I suppose) overthrows any of estate, except
for some great offense by some of the house committed, although (peradventure)
the same lies hid to the world and appears not. But this being an argument
that is daily in question amongst learned men, I will leave to them to be
discussed, and return to my former purpose, which is, that I could wish every
man that raises a house by his good industry, should be honored with some such
badge or mark, as should be answerable to the quality of his rising, and not
every man of what condition soever they be, to entrude themselves into the
signs and marks of soldiers, and such as follow the field with martial
exploits.

Some people also there are that be so precise, as that they do disallowe
altogether the setting forth of any memory of well deserving men, which have
showed themselves valiant either in the act of Religion, their Princes service,
or defense of their country, neither allowing their posterity to set forth
any memory of their praises, nor suffering any moniments or garnishments to
remain of their burials, as though it were a matter offensive to God to have
goodmen well spoken of, or their valorous doings by their obsequies either
reverenced, or by any record, remembered: To such men I have not thought it
amiss to show them their error by directing them to such places of Scripture
as do not only tolerate and allow of such actions, but also praise and commend
the doing thereof, and in some sort charge and command the same to be done,
whereby both they may (if they be not obstinate) reform their misconceaued
opinions, and others may be fortified in their praisefull endeavors toward the
honoring of virtuous and worthy men, to the animating of posterity to
imitate their laudable actions, sithence indeed the chiefest matter that
stirs up men to do well next their zeal to God, and the love of virtue it
self, is to think that not only their souls shall be rewarded with the
mercies of God, but also that their doings shall be had in a reverent
remembrance with the reports of all good men that shall speak of them: And
first, that the using, bearing and setting forth of Banners, Ensigns and
marks of armorie are allowable by the sacred scriptures, it appears by the
holy Evangelist Saint Luke recording the peregrination of Saint Paul, and
speaking of armorie without reprehension (which he would not have done had the
use thereof been offensive) in this sort: Act. Apost. Cap. 28.
Post menses autem tres nauigauimus in naui Alexandrina, quae in insula
Hyemauerat, cui erat insigne Castorum.

And in the book of Numeri God by his prophet Moses commands his people of
Israel to divide and dispose themselves into companies by their Ensigns and
Banners speaking unto them in these words: Number. cap. 2.
Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen and Aaron, dicens, singuli, per turmas, Signa,
atque vexilla, and domos cognationum suarum, castrametabuntur, filiorum Israel
per Gyrum tabernaculi foederis.

So that by this you may see, that as these matters be no new inventions of
men, so they are also things allowable by the word of God.

Neither do obsequies or moniments ensuing worthy acts want the authority of
Scriptures, for in the book of Numeri it is written thus: Number. ca. 31.
Cumque accessissent principes exercitus ad Moysen, and Tribuni, centurionesque
dixerunt, nos serui tui recensuimus numerum pugnatorum, quos habuimus sub manu
nostra: and ne vnus quidem defuit ob hanc causam offerimus in donarijs Domini
singuli quod in praeda auri potuimus inuenire, periscelides and Armillas,
annulos and dextralia ac murenulas, etc. Et susceptum intulerunt in
Tabernaculum testimonij in monimentum coram Domino.

And in an other place of Numeri thus: Number. cap. 16.
Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens, praecipe Eliazaro filio Aaron
sacerdoti, vt tollat Thuribula quae iacent in incendio, and ignem huc illucque
dispergat: etc. produc atque ea in laminas, and affigat altari: etc. vt cernant
ea pro signo and monimento filij Israel.

Also in the book of Joshua I find these words: Iosue lib. cap. 4.
Et ait Iosue ad eos, ite ante arcam Domini Dei vestri ad Iordanis medium, and
portate inde singuli singulos lapides in humeris vestris, iuxta numerum
filiorum Israel, vt sit signum inter vos: and quando interrogauerint vos filij
vestri cras, dicentes, quid sibi volunt isti lapides? Respondebitis, defecerunt
aquae Iordanis ante arcam foederis Domini, cum transiret eum, idcirco positi
sunt lapides isti in monimentum filiorum Israel vsque in aeternum.

And for the disposing of heritages it is written thus. Number. cap. 27.
Homo cum mortuus fuerit absque filio, ad filiam eius transibit haereditas. si
filiam non habuerit, habebit successores fratres suos. quod si and fratres non
fuerint, dabitis haereditatem fratribus patris eius. sin autem nec patruos
habuerit, dabitur haereditas his qui ei proximi sunt. Eritque hoc filijs Israel
sanctum lege perpetua sicut praecepit Dominus Moysi.

And for the collection of Genealogies thus says God to Moses and Eleasar:
Number. cap. 26.
Numerate omnem summam filiorum Israel a viginti annis and supra, per domos and
cognationes suas, cunctos qui possunt ad bella procedere: etc. Ruben
primogenitus Israel huius filius, Henoch, a quo familia Henochitarum: and
Phallu, a quo familia Phalluitarum: and Hesron, a quo familia Hesronitarum. And
for a further proof of the recording of Genealogies, it is to be considered
how diligently the same has been observed through the whole course of the
Scriptures, as the descents from Adam to Noe, and from Noe to Abraham, etc. do
sufficiently testify. And more that with the spirit of truth the Genealogy of
Christ our Savior and redeemer as concerning his humanity is also by the
writing of his holy Evangelists most plainly and sincerely remembered and
set down. All these things being therefore by the Scriptures of God, and
decider of all controversies, proved and declared: Your Lordships may see that
the bearing of Arms, raising and aduauncing of Standerds, Banners and
Ensigns, using of obsequies, erecting of moniments, enroling and regestrings
of pedegrees and descentes have joined to the ancient customs and Laws both
of this Land and all other nations, the authority of Gods word being very well
accompanied with discretion, reason, and judgment, for God having by his
sacred institution ordained Kingdoms, Provinces, and Seignories, and that over
them Kings, Princes and Magistrates, shall command, rule and govern his
people, to the end chiefly that his heavenly kingdom may be replenished with
the blessed souls of his servants, for the instructing whereof he has also
ordained his holy Church, and the Bishops, pastors and ministers of the same,
which Bishops and other spiritual officers cannot so well inform his Christan
people without the aid of the said Kings and temporal Lords: neither can they
govern their particular Countries either from the invasion of outward tyrants
or inward rebels, but through the use of their sword of justice, which sword
cannot be exercised against unruly persons being of strength wanting men
skilful in Martial Discipline, who cannot manage those affairs but by mean
of the aforesaid Arms and ensigns, in manner as before I have more largly
expressed. And in like sort as Princes, great Lords, Judges, Magistrates and
Governors, do use to wear sacred Robes of gold, purple, scarlet, and other
ornaments and apparel, not to take pride in, or for any vain ostentation or
show, but only that they may be distinguished from the inferior people, to the
end that a reverent regard may be had of them in respect of the high office
which under God here on earth they bear. And as these things no man of any
reason will gainsay, so I see not but as well may their just virtues and good
government be remembered with funerals, obsequies, and moniments, after their
decease, whereby such as succeed in government may also be had in more high
estimation, and a fair example is thereby given them to imitate the regiment
of their predecessors. Likewise does the registring of descents carry with it
reason joined to authority and custom, for as by Gods law there is commanded
a privilege of enheritance to the first begotten of Israel, and so for want
of sons to the females, and from them to others answerable to the proximitie
of their blood and kindred, which with our laws of this land, and of most
nations do concur and agree, it does well stand with peaceful government for
the avoiding of contentions which may rise for want of records, to testify the
truth of men's titles to their enheritances, that Genealogies and Pedegrees
should be enrolled and kept in remembrance.

I have my good Lords stood the longer upon this point, for that of late
traueling through some countries of this Land, and having a desire to see the
moniments of antiquity which have remained in such places as I passed by, for
which cause as otherwise I many times resorted to Churches and other houses to
satisfy my affection, I found that many moniments both of burials and in
glass were so broken and defaced, that uneath may be had any knowledge what the
fragments remaining did signify: and enquiring of the inhabitance how it came
to pass that those things were so blemished, they made report that certain
persons, delighting as may seem in novelty, for they can abide no mark of
antiquity, had defaced the same. These men that take upon them to be
reformers, whose desires are great through the singularity and pride they have
in their own wits and understandings, weening themselves to be very wise,
where indeed they are very simple, and only look but into the abuses of
things, and do not see into the grounds and depth of the reasons and causes for
which good ordinances were made, go about to find faults, where many times
none are, but if peradventure they hap to find an ordinance well made misused,
then straight never seek they to reform the abuse, but by their wills, down
goes ordinance and all, such is their insolency, rashness, and want of
judgment. It were well done therefore my good Lords, and I could wish that
your Honors having sometimes access to her Majesty, and oftentimes conference
with my Lords of her privy Council, should inform her Highness, and their
Honors of the said abuses committed, and to be thereby a mean that these
simple fellows taking upon them to be reformers, might be reformed themselves,
and both kept from destroieng of good ordinances, and be punished for their
offenses in that behalf committed. In the mean time yet shall I desire that
Honorable personages will look better to the moniments of their ancestors, by
correcting the destroiers thereof, and therein to imitate the laudable actions
of William Fleetwood, Serieant at the Law, and Recorder of the City of London,
who being commissioner amongst others for the visitation of causes
Ecclesiastical, by the Princes authority, by virtue thereof imprisoned
certain wilful persons that had defaced the moniment of Queen Katherine
Dowyger at Peterborough, until such time as they had reformed the same, which
thing was through his good endeavor reedified and perfected again, and so
remains to this day: for although some happily see standing those of their
own parents, yet it were good they should foresee that no others be pulled
down, for that there is not to be looked for but that suffering such injuries
to rest unpunished, the dooers thereof will in time grow more insolent, and
have a cast to overthrow theirs also.

And now being in speech of moniments, I cannot but remember their ignorance
who make small account of any ancestour except before the Conquest, weening
that all that lie crosse-legged so were: and that all ancient evidence without
date is the like: whereas the one was not had in use until after the Palestine
wars, and the other, such as be sealed, be also since the Conquest, for I could
never see nor hear of any that had seen sealed deed, but the same was made
sithence the Conquest of this Land, when the use (as I take it) of sealing with
wax first began in England.

But these men will not stoop one jot under the Conquest, telling many
fables of their ancestors then preserving their houses, Honors, and Armories,
forgetting quite that it is much more glorious and honorable to be descended
from a most famous nation conquering, then such people by plain feate of Arms
subiuged, for as the Poet says, quis enim sua praelia victus
Commemorare velit? referam tamen ordine, nec tam
Turpe fuit vinci, quam contendisse decorum est,
Magnaque dat nobis tantus solatia victor.
So that if they have any thing praise worthy left to brag of, it is that
they well contended with so puissant conquerors, which were then in their time
as wise, glorious, and famous a nation as were in the whole world to be found.

Another sort there be not much more skillful, who if they see any Armorie,
straight enter into the comparison of the fairenes thereof: and foul and false
is it, if metal lie upon metal alone, or color upon color: And yet I
could wish we should never have more dishonorable men nor worse soldiers than
have so borne their Armorie: for to omit that worthy Godfrey, and that Mack
Morise king of Lymster in Ireland, whose only daughter and heir was married
to Richard Strongbowe Earl of Penbroke, and bare in a black shield a red
ramping Leon, of our own sir Richard Sanbach of Sanbach in Chesshire, sir
William Wakbirge of Wakbirge in Darbyshire, two valiant Knights, yet both bare
color upon color. Passing the number of examples, I will only recite the
words of mine Author speaking of the adventures of a brave Knight in the
company of sir Robert Canole resting by Parris, this Knight having vowed to
strike with his lance on the barriers of the city, performed it, and then the
words be these: Celluy cheualier ie ne sca comment il auoit nom ne de quel pays
il estoit mais s'armoit a gueulles a deux fousses noyeres et vne bordure noyre
non endente. And although I grant they be not so well to be discerned, as when
metal and color be varied the one with the other, yet sithence the number be
great of most worthy men that have borne their arms in such manner, I will
esteem their marks as honorable as the rest, and never impute any falsitie to
them. And this kind of men also commonly descant upon the proportion, nature,
and quality of the devise, as if the name of Richard were better than Robert,
and Ralph better than Roger, and in their conceits the Eagle or Faulcon are the
fairest birds to be borne of all fethered fowls, and so of other the like:
when indeed except for the reverence due to the bearers, who do honor their
bearings by their renown, virtue, and valor, otherwise there is no difference
in the fairenes of marks: but that those only are to be preferred which be
easiest to be perceived, discerned, and known to be the same things they be
marked out for: And therefore the Capitale of Beusz black Midas head with his
fair long Ass ears was as good a crest, as sir John Chandos chiftains head
proper in a white scarffe goodly enuellopped: and as fair a cote is Hopwells,
being three red hares playing on bagpipes in a silver shield, as Newinton which
bare d'Azure three eglets d'Argent displaid. And now me thinks I hear some
that esteem me to mend, and become more fine, skillful, and Herald like in my
emblazons, as using the French phrases of d'azyer and d'argent, who think I
doubt not, but that I have committed a great error for want of using the said
French phrases in my emblazons, notwithstanding I will join in opinion with
such as esteem it to be more proper to speak and use English terms and
phrases in an English book dedicated to Englishmen, than French or Latin,
otherwise than cited authority leads.

And now my good Lords, and you brave Soldiers and Gentlemen, I have little
else to trouble you with at this time, but to wish you had no worse a writer
to eternize your fame then mine Author sir John Froissart was to the Knights,
and Captains of England your predecessors, and to crave your patience in that I
have been so unadvised to molest you this long with these tedious and simple
travels of mine, caused through the great zeal and affection I bear to your
praiseable profession, and that you would pardon my boldness in the writing and
dedicating thereof to your Honors: nevertheless, I beseech you again sithence
they entreat of matter tending to the advancement of your glories, that you
would vouchsafe to accept of them in good part, and with the shields of your
worthy favors to protect them from the outrage of such as envy your
memorable virtues, praieng to God that all your noble atchiuements may be with
no less praise remembered, then our knights of that time were spoken of by sir
Arnold Dandrehen martial of France, there enemy to King Henry of Castile the
valiant bastard, a little before the battle of Naueret, and because at my
first entrance into this matter, I saluted you with a sentence of mine author,
I have thought it no bad Decorum with his report of those speeches being as
follows, to take my leave. Sire sire saulue soit vostre Grace (says he) vos
die q^ qua^t par battaille vous assembleres au Prince vous trouueres la gens
d'armes tells comme il les fault trouuer car la est la fleur de tout Cheualrie
du monde, and la trouueres durs sages Combatants and a bonnes certes and ia
pour mourir plain pie nen fuiront, etc.

LORD CHANDOS. THE GLORIOUS LIFE AND HONORABLE DEATH OF SIR JOHN CHANDOS, LORD
OF SAINT Saluiour, le Vicount, great Seneschall of Poyctow, high Constable of
Acquitaine, Knight of the honorable order of the Garter, elected by the first
founder king Edward the third at his institution thereof.
LET none rejoice too much in fortunes state,
Reading the story of my tragike death,
But watchful be to attend some turning fate,
Which like wild whirlwind all our doings sweath.
For as grave Senec, in wise morals seath,
No mortal man with Gods gain favor might
Of warrantice, to see next mornings light.
No earthly one, how goodly so he seem
Fine, fair, or perfect how so he appear,
Renowned, rich, of excellent esteem,
That firmly stands, and fixed form does bear,
For wauing fortune so the ship will stear,
With giddie guiding to her fond intent,
Nor wit nor prowess can bad rule prevent.
Uncertain more than is slow Lidian brook,
Which dallieth his winding banks within
Fast forward hasts, then does regardant look
Staying in doubt, the ocean t'enter in,
Or to reslide where first it did begin
Yet suddenly, quick plungeth in amain
After much show turns back to springs again.
No whistling fowler has so many gins,
No wading fisher half so many baits,
No nimble spider threeds so many spins,
No toiling hunter tenth part of deceits
That fortune has of woondrous ticing feats,
Training men on, triumphing in their fall,
Showing them honey, poisning them with gall.
As AEacus imagind was to deal
With Tantalus deluded with the pray
Of hungers ease: and scalding thirsts assail,
Whom weary proffers make to empty way,
Yet near vncaught the luring fruit does stay,
So are they fed high honors seek to gain,
Sheed manies blood and purpose not obtain.
When fortune shows her friendly countenance,
What mighty ones in self conceits we seem,
Weighty affairs dispose by ordinance,
As what we list to bring to pass we deem,
In our own reach each thing we do esteem,
We him appoint to death, and him we ^ease,
Welding whole world as does our liking please.
Led onward with hope of long assurance,
We never think of fortunes frowning,
But high honors plant as if perdurance
had promised continual showring,
Fresh still to increase increased springing,
But long before proud honor takes root
Wisest forecasting proved is no boot.
Often when we are most busy tampering,
Some foes to trap within our plotted snares,
Not him unlike who pit is digging,
Headlong into it falls himself unawares,
So we surprised in our own affairs,
For fortune that attends worldly chance,
Where smooth she smild, now blinketh wide askaunce.
For proof mark me of her dear darlings one
That seemd to have her fettred fast in gives,
It might be thought that only I alone
Fair favor had: and thus she daily strives
To have the chiefest regement of our lives,
That when she list to knit the brows and frown
He standing high is quickly tumbled down.
When first that worthy golden book began
For Magistrates bright mirror clear indeed,
Through which eternal praise the Authors wan,
Straight I beleeud as truly as my Creed
My hard mishap so happily would speed,
As that some one of those rare learned men
My blis and bale would have vouchsaft to pen.
In perfect die could they have pictured
False turncote with true shadows in true kind,
Her fained show of truth, and truest falshed,
Her glosing face, and her unconstant mind,
And her continual foe-mate still I find,
Since fates she drives my spent life to rehearse
In lowly rimes refuse of lofty verse.
Outrageous she slays without remorse
Alike most worthy and unworthy wight,
As roling wave that needs must have the force
Tossing light things subjected to great might
Respectles where or when so ere they light,
So careless she not caring when or how
She casts down or makes low to bow.
What time King Edward first invaded France
With good aid of th'erle of Henauld won,
Friend fortune then mine acts seemd to advance,
So euenly my silken thread did run.
High enterprise what I attempt was done
With shining glory, and fair honors name,
As golden trumpe shield forth John Chandos fame.
Then as my King by Cambray City past
I armd approchd the barriers of the town,
There lept I in, my foes some wondered fast
To see my deed: a Squier of renown
John de saint Ager, strove to beat me down:
Right strong we coped with stern courage bold
Our mighty bufs some ioyed to behold:
Ecchoing stroks on eithers helmet lights
With sparkling fire thundering mightily,
All for glorious praises both our fights
Stird with youths heat and mindful dignity,
Th'assailed strikes and both incessantly
Imprinting dents do yeald, so I at last
Returned with praise: on with the Army past.
When as the French had gathered mighty power
Came to Vironfosse, where treaty ended war,
Froisard me recounts among the flower
Of English Squiers, sets my fame full far.
In his large book is shone: how much we are
In reverence bound, unto such learned clarks
As with their pain eternize broad our warks.
For if none should register noble deed,
There Is none would strive to show his noblenes,
Or press in virtues others to exceed,
If memory none made were of valiantnes:
Freshlie burgening to future ages,
This pricking spur does hearts heroic heave,
To think fell death fair Fame cannot bereave.
Some sots there be so scrupulous that naught
At all believe but what themselves do see,
These coy iudgers have seld or nener thought
Of times forepast what mighty men might be:
Of others deem by thimbecilitie,
Found in themself, recall in question when
Our acts memorizd are by learned men.
This truce expirde King Edward new prepared
puissantly to pass the foming flud,
Which gate king Phillip strongly thought t'aue bard,
Decking a fleet thick seeming like a wood,
Whereof had charge three captains seamen good,
Sir Hugh Kyriell, Babuchet, Barbnoire,
With stretched sails the narrow seas do scower.
These Chieftaines forty thousand men command
Laid by French King to stop us if they could:
Which when our King had spide he does demand
What masts they were so thick he does behold,
His Pylot named them and well he told,
These were the foes that so his costs anoid,
Southamton town, and th'yle of Wight destroid.
Replide the king: Saint George, God be our guide,
I much desire with yonder fleet to fight,
A looffe to winde-ward all our Navy wride
To view the turn right goodly was the sight,
Banners, pensils, stremers, wauing bright:
Ladies we had whose minds these sights might daunt,
Going to see the Queen brought bed at Gaunt:
Whose presences fresh minds encouraged
With double flame t'assaile the enemy,
For trusty servants often had vowed
For their sweet sakes t'prooue all extremity
T'fight for his Lady knights felicity,
hot fervent love makes coldest coward bold,
desirous much gaie Ladies grace to hold.
In front the French forth plast a goodly ship
The Christopher: from ours but lately taken,
Fraught full of those which we compeld to skip
mid washing waves unto their dismal bane,
Thus may we note how Fortunes fuls do wane,
Blithe this ship of Clarions now does sound
And even now with horror does abound.
Our foes whose number four for one did pas,
Like men at arms they Fortune strive to try,
Hideous broyle, monsterous noise there was
Enuffe to have made a fainting heart to die,
On surging seas more fell fierce battails be
Then on firm land: each one must bide the fray,
And fight it out there is no other way.
From dashing ships the pointed arrow fly
Like stones of hail forced by an esterne wind,
Wherewith great numbers Frenchmen stout do die,
And now to board, then linked chains do bind
Big ships so fast, they cannot soon vntwinde,
Fierce strong incounters and huge deadly blows
From forced arm that many overthrows.
From morn till noone indurd tempesteous broile
With mighty rage upon the raging flood,
We English soldiers took no little toil,
Stout enemies aduentrous tried and good,
Yet voiding scoppers voided out their blood,
Near unto Sluice they were all take and slain,
Victorious we do home return again.
About this time the Duke of Britton died,
Wanting issue for so right noble place,
A brother one he had by fathers side
John Earl Mountfort sprung of ancient race:
Another brother had he in like case,
Begot of father one and mother same
Dead: left issue, a noble virtuous dame:
Married well unto sir Charles of Bloys
Extract from race right honorable fair,
German cosen to Phillip of Valoys,
Strife great begone for the Duke of Brittons chair,
For either of these claimed to be heir.
Brave King of France Bloys his part maintaind:
Stout English King, the Mountforts he sustaind.
To Britton did send back thrice noble knight
Sir Robert D'artois Earl of Richmount made,
Whose banner blew with golden lillies dight
A Castile labell fair for difference laid:
And by his skill in valiant warlike trade
He conquered Vaus, and country proching near:
But conquered town did cost him very deer,
For in defense of it he knightly died.
His too soon loss displeasd king Edward so,
Enraged swear he would not long abied
Till well he were revenged of his fo,
Strongly prepared to Britton does he go,
Soon brake we holds, and tore wald castles strong,
Four mighty towns besiegd at once ere long.
The Normain Duke like right valiant prince
Came with four thousand proper men at arms,
And thirty thousand of others to convince
Our English troops that dreadles were of harms,
By skillful means of two wise Cardnals charms
Calm peace was made three whole years to endure,
And valiant kings both swear to keep it sure.
Thus he that in eternal heavens rayns
And hearts of kings has in his governance,
Their frowning storms unto fair smiling gleams
Does change unto his heavenly pleasance,
Rules often their thoughts so to his ordinance.
They may devise, but he will whole dispose,
What long they build, he soonest overthrows.
Thyer a thousand three hundred forty, more,
Saint George his day king Edward did prepare
A royal feast, proclaiming it before
In France, Flaunders, in Henault, and Almaine,
All knights that would vouchsafe to take the pain
Should safety have for to return in peace
When as the iusts and knightly sports did cease.
And there the king selected proved knights
In martial feats and battelous stoure,
That had their shields shone to their enemies sights,
And forcement made with strong redoubted power,
Due praises gaind and durable honor,
And made us swear that feasts continuance,
Which was maintaind through noble chevachance.
Thus as the king triumphant sports did hold,
News him was brought did much his mind displease
How Lord Clisson had lost his head they told,
And maletrait, the French kings ire t'apease,
Conceiud because some did false rumor raise,
Untrue they were unto the crown of France,
Ten Lords there died, such still is fortunes chance.
Which known report caused king Edwards frowns,
And fierce maintaind the French had broke the peace:
Sir Henry Leon set at ten thousand crowns
For ransom when he promisd not to cease
For to defy his king in open press,
Th'erle of Darbie he into Gascoyn sends
To vengefull war his mind he all intends.
Which valiant Earl Plantagenet namde
At Hampton barkt, at Burdeux does ariue
(His banner, England with French label famde)
He thought to show unto his foes beliue,
Staid at Burdeux but even days thrice five,
Bergarath, Angolesme, and Aguilon,
With thirty holds and towns he took anon.
Toth court of France this voyage well was known
How this stout Earl so many towns had wone,
The spoil his soldiers got far wide was blown,
The king pondering of this mischief done,
He sommons made, and sent Duke John his son
Attended with a hundred thousand men,
His late lost towns for to obtain again.
This mighty host did Angolesme enclose,
Which brave John Norwich an Englishsquire held
Hardly constraind, wisely does dispose
His buisnes and this mighty army weld:
Thanks his good wit that so his lesson speld.
An honest shift to find at time of need,
Deserves praise upon the happy speed.
It was the eve, before our Lady day,
He saw the town began to mutonie
Unto the walls he took the ready way
Made none acquainted with his priuitie,
His cap toth host he waued speedily,
They are aduisd: demanding what he meant:
He said to speak with Duke was his intent.
The courteous Lord him quickly satisfied,
Then being come demanded if he would
Yield: he said I am not so advised
Most noble Duke, the town I well may hold,
I do entreat your grace we may be bold,
The morrow next without yours disturbance
To do unto our Lady reverence.
In honor of whom I your grace requier
Of one days truce for me and all my band:
The Norman Duke agreed to his desire.
With thanks John bowed like a pliant wand:
The morrow morn fair armed he does stand
Straight parted down in blew and fiery red,
With ermine, Lion stern ramping decked.
Then issuing the French to Armor stirred,
He stepped forth and willed them to stay:
Sirs he said? your Duke us peace has granted
Which I must use to mine own best assay:
On suddenly some went without delay
Unto the Duke: declard what had been said,
And how as yet the Army had him staid.
When this good duke his wise excuse had hard
Commandment gave that he should safe depart,
His promise give he wild should not be bard,
For kept he would tho woorser were his mart:
A virtue fitting well his Princely heart.
The Captain gone, then Angolesme does yield
With seven Towns more, the Frenchmen hold the field,
Right strong before Aguillon be they come,
Plast in the meddowes fair about the hold,
A hundred thousand men, a goodly sum,
on foot and horseback well and truly told,
Before they part this Castle have they would,
The Duke so vowed, unless for him the king
His Father sent and for no other thing:
Full seven months the army held their ground,
Within which time so many brave assaies
For to defend so many practice found
In forraging so many goodly fraies,
Such skirmiges and that such sundry ways,
To win the same: as Greeks had never more
When they strong Ilion planted were before.
This Castle strongly seated is between
Two sliding streams, that vessels well may bear:
Environed with gawdie meddow green,
Upon the which right bitter bickering are
Often on the rivers fight they without fear,
Sir Gualter Mannie chief of the English band,
Full expert knight on water or on land.
This courteous knight sage, imagenatiue,
Found to his foes much warlike buisnes,
Right warily affairs does he contriue
For sure defense of honor spotles,
Courageous knight and valiant doubtless:
Yellow banner he showed, three Cheurons black
An English Lion on the highmost stake.
Whilst thus thassailaunt and defendaunt strive
Every day some practice new to do,
The King of England maks have to ariue
Hearing declard his friends besiged so,
Conveniently he hasts himself to go
To rease the Duke: from Hamton port he saild,
Contrary wind made that his purpose faild.
For where he thought in Gascoine to take land
Sir Godfrey Harcourt causd him change his mind,
Whose reasons being by grauest counsel scand
And likte because contrary was the wind,
A fair large bay in Constantine we find
Called Hogg saint vast: from shipping well ariud
In Battails three our Army is contriud.
Toward wealthfull Cane we onward hold our way,
And all the Country wast with sword and fire,
The Earl of Tankervile made with us a fray
Fast to the town we forced him to retier,
After taken by his own desire
Within the town, of which we Masters were
And Country round all trembled fast with fear.
Our sovereign determinde in his mind
To pass through France to Callis if he could:
The Castle of Poys we in the way do find
Rease assault and easly gain the hold,
Nothing so strong might dure our forcement bold
Absent the owner of the fort away:
Spoild was the town because they false did play.
Two damesels fair were in this Castle found
Of beauty rare and of fine tender age,
Who rudely Ravished had been in that stound
Save that Lord Basset, and my self in rage
Did them defend, and by aduisement sage,
Safely protect, and brought before the King
Which them receiud and thankt us for the thing.
Right princely he and sweetly intertaind
These Virgins, causing them to be conuaid
To Corby town: high praise hereby we gaind.
Each armed Knight who Knighthood true has waid
Will suffer no foul act done silly maid,
A souerain praise it is to armed Knight
Outrageous acts to hinder by his might.
What wight, vile sin forbids not if he may,
Consents and guilty is to wicked ill.
The King does march to Callis seeking way
The river of some we are attaind until
Where Godmare say a Knight of warlike skill,
Having in charge from sovereign to keep
The passages where water was not deep.
The Knight obeyed, and Knightly did his best,
Due worthy praise each man does well deserve
That to his power fulfils his Princes hest,
Tho tickle fortune seem often times to swerue
As unto him who leader like did serve:
Strong Archer shot so whely all together
From kept defense the Frenchmen they deseuer.
When this Baron I mean sir Godmare say,
Saw this huge mischief light amongst his men
What he can help when fortune says nay:
Fairly withdrew the best he could as then,
Its wisdom good for each commander when
Things cross fall out, to govern so his will
That he the more for lesser do not spill.
Into the water bravely did we mount
Which at that time passed with channel lo,
Where overthrown Knights were of good account
The passage won, dame fortune favored so
To be admierd how she can ouerthroe,
Thus we Blanchtaque by noble courage gain
Gladded with joy in lieu of passed pain.
Thus when we had acquierd the further bank,
The gracious King as duty does requier
To mighty God yields most humble thank:
Highly inflamed King Philips boiling yer
In street to close us was his chief desire,
Angerly vexed with Lord Godmare fay
Till sir John Henault does his rage allay.
Forth hold we martch to Cressie in Ponthew,
The King his mind the Camp should there be staid
Well informed the Frenchmen him pursew,
A space pondring lastly to us said,
This Land my mothers dower should have staid
It given was: therefore here make I choice,
To challenge it from Philip of Valoys.
And for that we were scarcely one against eight,
We warely batteled at advantage
Th'assayling tempter by fine skillful sleight Of warlike heed for to indammage,
Three battles ordered for knightly usage:
Ith first the Prince, and Earl of Warwick were
In guls a fes six croslets gold did bear.
Sir Reignald Cobham, strongly armd in red
Three sable stars plast on a Cheuron gold.
Sir Barthelmew Burwash in like color sped
Gold ramping Lion queue does forked hold.
Amongst these first, my name is also told.
Sir Richard Stafford in gold shield did bear
A gulie Cheuron and blew Labell fair.
With us there were eight hundred men at Arms,
Two thousand Archers, Brigands a thousand
Purposely bent to work fell enemies harms:
Ith second did the earl of Northanton stand,
With men at Arms just numbered to our band
Twelve hundred Bows: in gold Lord Basset dight
Three Rubie piles a quarter ermins bright.
Fair clad in Arms seven hundred the king
With bowmen thousands two for guard abide
Well pointed and directed every thing,
Our second battle moude somewhat aside
Us first to second as the time espide:
The king withdrew him to a windmill hill,
Where he and his all day they stooden still.
When as the French thus heard of our address
They forward came bedect right sightly,
It pleasure was taview their nobleness,
Their gilded armors glistering brightly,
To fight with them stird us more lightly:
High valerous mind where enterprise is brave
Would conquer honor and due praises crave.
Too long to tell the fierce incounters made,
The puissant strength or courage of the foe,
How every prince in order does invade,
Or how the arrows flew like flakes of snow,
Or how the horse their masters overthrow,
Or how we were oppressed so with might,
As that we sent unto the king a knight:
Requesting him with his fresh power to aid
His tender son so fiercely fought withal:
What slain or wounded is my son he said:
That thus they send and for my succor call:
Neither: the knight? then tell him that he shall
Replide the king? his first worn spurs obtain
To him and his the honor shall remain.
When as we heard this answer us resent,
As lions fell with fasting mawes near pinde
Amongst the herds new come do fellie rent
The silly flock: such like our us find.
For many lives from bodies we vntwinde,
Fourscore banners dejected to the ground,
And sixscore knights were there prostrated found,
And thirty thousand of the common sort:
With sir Reignald Cobham three Heralds sent
Searching the fields of truth to give report
For to be slain: so fully were we bent
To fight when as we hard the Kings intent:
Some Knights yet thought he dealt but over hard
That of his succor we were so debard.
This happy day by noble valiantnes
We vanquished, immortal fame we gaind:
And so the King held on his purposes
To Callis, where as we long time remaind:
That stoutest Knights garding the town constraind,
Surrender make of Callis to his will,
All which he does with English people fill.
Duke Hanniball when as grave senate sent
And him home called to aid his native soil,
From Italy with no less anguish went,
Then did Duke John from Aguillon recoyle,
Long having lean was loath to suffer foil,
But his sad father wild him thence in have
Us to resist that much his Country wast.
How turning times do trauerse humane course,
From ruffling war to calmest quietness,
And does allay the mightiest rage and force
Appearing pleasant temperat stilnes,
Freed of Tumult, stur or buisnes,
For clanging trumpet and harsh armors sound
Dainty blis and meriment is found:
For Cardnall Guy of Bullen he was sent
As legate into France, well does entreat
Firm peace between the kings, until was bent
Their raged minds: to endure without deceat
Twixt them and theirs, till two years out were beat.
Home went our king: but Britton was except
Where two brave Ladies cruel wars they kept:
The one of Mountfort entitled Countess,
Whose husband did a prisoner late in France,
Redoubted Lady of great valientnes
Sharp wars maintaind for all her Lords mischance,
Amason like would ride with shield and Lance,
Defend her self with battelous axe in fist
Threatening blows bestow and well resist.
On swelling seas puissance has she tried,
In stormy fight amongst the mightiest
With enemies blood the marble waters did,
With brave Bundutia or Viragoes best,
Great Edelsleda or the woorthiest,
Of manly dames, that wouen maile have worn,
She may compare for valerous adorn.
The Other possessed a Lions heart in breast
Little Inferior to her courageous foe,
Sir Charles of Bloys her husband now did rest
A prisoner, fell fortune would it so:
Against whom she often her mighty power did shoe.
These warlike dames hard wars do still maintain
T'on for her son, the other for husbands gain.
The two years truce expierd King Phillip died,
And John his son was Crowned in his sted.
Our Prince of Knights when he his time espied
Surnamed black: from England is he sped,
And into Gascoine warlike Knights he led,
Whose virtue good and courage did abound,
And for no death would flee on foot of ground.
To Thoulous, and Carcasson led his host
Late before the River of Garron past,
Having burned and spoiled all the cost,
With pillage store and prisners fiaunct fast
To Burdeux safe returned at the last,
Tho the earl of Arminack and the earl of Fois
Had Countries charge with soldiers of some chois.
The prince fresh in the flowers of his youth
So much desierd to follow martial deeds,
As duly to recount of him the truth
His noble thought thereon he only feeds,
Right busy Lord, to sow wild otes his seeds,
A second rode does into Berry make,
And country round at pleasure spoil and take.
King John informed of our chevachaunce
His sommons called: but first of all he sent
Three Barons wise t'aduise our ordinance:
Lord Craon, Bowciqualt, and the Herment,
Called of Chaumount: who ordered their intent
Us to entrap: abushment one they plast,
From which we drove them to a castle fast,
Called Remorentine: the prince does me command
To go persuade these foresaid knights to yield,
I salued them, which done I do demand
Surrender of the castle which they held
Unto my Lord, that matters so would weld
Of courtesy, unto his rendered foe
Of custom used in like case to shoe.
This rendering mart they thought too bad to make
All three men of proved valor much,
In silken white that puffing blast did shake
Black egle spread whose either head does tuch
The banners sides: sir Bowcequalts was such,
That forth he hoised wefting in the wind,
Thinking he does himself in safety find:
Plain said he would no folly such commit
As to become a prisner without cause,
Trusting right well himself for to acquit,
But morrow morn they yielded without pause
Thereto compeld by raging fires laws,
Of well conceived hope they were beguild,
Their fortress left, forsaken and exild.
Like sparkling lightning drove by southern blast,
Scorching all it finds in hit power,
The valerous prince proceeds with like waste
In burning Towns, in raising many a Tower,
Such hideous storms he on the French does shower,
Rich spoils we gained, and great booties wone,
Without control of ought which we had done.
The valiant and renowned king of France
When as he hard our Prince in field to be,
Vowed to fight, in arms to prove his chance,
And careful was by Poyicters town least we
Should there repasse, or that he should us see:
Worthy king most worthy glorious crown,
Right valiant Lord, though Fortune now did frown.
He sommoned brave Dukes, stout Earls and Lords
In batteled arms before him to appear,
With so much haste as hasty speed affords
Encountering strength against us foes to rear,
Resolud to fight as one deuoid of fear,
No spare of cost to furnish his intent,
Lofty thoughts on vengfull battle bent:
When this great mass of men all mustered were
The battles three ordained out of hand,
Gay duke of Orleaunce first well gouernd there,
Where six and thirty wauing banners stand,
Long pennons twice so many there were fand,
Beat with fine arms of every Lord and knight
Most glorious unto the gasers sight:
Charles duke of Normandy had second guiding,
The third, stout king, and there dressed to behold
Fair knights in glistering armors shining,
Proud stamping steeds richly trapt in gold,
High placed crests that hautie helm does hold,
Trim flower of France in their brave araie,
For gallantnes here present were full gaie
Ordered: did mount on steed as white as snow,
Of courage like the king that on him sat,
Knightly armd ride forth from rank to row
With smiling grace his men to animate,
Did pleasing and right stirring words relate
So Castor like, with kingly resemblaunce
And kindled heat his speech he did advance:
My Lords in parle at Parris when you be
Your English foes you stoutly menace,
Desiring that so happy day to see
To find them ranged in some open place,
Here is the thing apparent to your face
The only thing that you so much did crave,
The English plast in open field you have:
And as the king was in this parlaunce
Lord Ribamount, who had our battles seen
Sent for that cause to view our guidaunce,
Approcht the king saying, sir as I ween,
Your enemies in one battle placed been
Are men at arms two thousand as I guess,
Five thousand, five hundred, archers no less:
Right sagely they and warily ordered ar
With bowmen they have all the hedges lind,
None can approach the streights the watching bar
We hard adventure and perilous find
If we assail: the king requiers his mind
Which way were best: for he meant to invade,
Then presently all things were ready made.
As thus the king prepared was to fights
The cardnall of Perigourt came in have,
Full lowly on his knees toth king resits
How dangerously he might dear subjects wast,
Pondring if it pleased his grace to cast
With him all his peers his enemies wear
A desperate remnant waying what was thear,
Willing the King to give him leave to prove,
Whether the Prince so to him would agree
Peace might be had: the Prince thereto did move
If with his honor it might concluded be,
Fair offers made: king John would none but he
Himself, and more, a hundred in his field
Of his own choice as prisners all should yield:
Whilst busy cardnall spent this day in vain,
It being truce: some special knights did ride
Their foes to view, and manner of their train,
I riden forth, returning me espide
Lord Cleremount, who quickly to me hied,
Chandos quoth he? how long thus have you borne
My sole devise, and for your own it worn?
We both were clad in vestments wrought as one,
A Lady blew in glistering Phoebus rays:
I then replid, its only mine alone
And none of yours? whereto the Frenchman says,
You English ianglers use such speech always,
Of your gross wits can nothing new devise,
What others wear, is pleasing to your eyes.
But if the truce withheld not I would prove,
It whole were mine and that you did me wroong.
Why sir (I said) to morrow i will not remove
From of the field, I will be in the throng,
But if it chance I meet you them among,
I Will make it good for all your fluent tongue,
That properly to me it does belong.
Contrary unto sacred usage
I was not in my arms invested,
Ware strange devise too great abusage,
And an others which he not disgested,
No knightly mind should be infested
With error such, his own arms not to wear,
But found conceits and others toys to bear:
Too cruel I causd this brave noble killed
The morrow when hydeous was the fray,
For checking me I made his blood be spild,
His murder I commanded that same day
Providing that no ransom he should pay,
For which God would the like to hap to me
In my discourse as you shall plainly see:
What greater burden to a noble mind
Then to be clogged with murtherous thought?
What mightier harm can brave captains find
Then when their noble doings are forth sought?
That they unto their fame such blame have brought:
This cholerike action often I did repent
When God on me threw equal punishment.
When labring Cardnall could no truce obtain
He did depart: but we that day had spent
Right busily, did each devise ordain
That best was thought or Art could best invent:
Eight thousand we that in this journey went:
Threescore our foes among which two thousand knights
Full goodly Armd; t'aue seen these gorgeous sights.
The morrow day when blushing sun did rise
Great pleasure it was thus to behold us dight:
One of the things that most delights man's eyes
Is for to see a glistering Army bright,
Fair dressed in Arms, in order duly pight,
Prepared to join: even so both parties were
And ever I about the Prince was nere:
Who Hector like in battelous Arms was clad,
Enuirnd as he intending to have burnd
The Greekish fleets: said noble hearts be glad,
High victory almighty God has turned
To fewest folks and greatest number spurnd,
If we be slain we all have valiant friends
To venge our deaths on those that work our ends:
Therefore I pray each Lord in presence now,
To prove his best, and have regard to see
His honor kept, I here my Lords do vow,
A Knight most good and resolute to be,
And that no chance shall make me yield or flee.
Most mighty Prince thy words did so inflame
Our settled minds to die was but a game.
And as the battles now approchen near,
Sir James Audley clad in glorious red
Fair fretted gold: does to the Prince appear,
Requesting that for former service led
It Is father and to him in loyal sted,
To give him leave the foremost man to be
For to assail the ventrous enemy.
Sweetly accords the prince to his desire,
Gave him his hand, and wished him well to speed,
Such special grace that he might there acquier
All present knights in virtue to exceed:
He chose a place to make his vow a deed,
And by the help of four right trusty squiers
He won th'achieument of his high desiers.
Sir Eustace Dabrigcourt fearing t'be behind
Did baisse his gleaue and well embrace his shield,
And as the arrow from the bow does twind
He flies toward the enemies field,
An Almain knight his coming well behield
In silver targ that bare five roses red,
They strongly meet and both down tumbled,
Dabscote no harm received by his fall
But lightly up himself again does rease,
Five Almains straight they light upon him all
At once: and bear him down with mighty feas.
So among his foes tide to a cheer he stays,
Until that we that ground recovered had
Losd, he fard, like tiger raging mad.
Here lusty knights were and aduenturous
As ever foming courser carried,
At good virtue most bravely aemulous
Ever thinking too long they tarried,
Until that enemies stout they harried,
The venturous heart does often adventure chieue
That many hearers scarcely will believe.
So hideous waxt the stur, so strong the broyle,
So fell the fight, so cruel was the shot,
And men at arms they strove with forced toil,
Nor shields, nor armors gay defended not
The bodies from the shafts, who paid the scot
Where right they hit: and thus discomfit was
Their martial host that foremost on did pas.
I waited time and spoke unto the prince,
Sir sir pass forth, the iourneys yours I see,
Set on the king, good fight must him convince,
He valerous is I know he will not flee,
This day you vowed a knight most good to be.
He quickly said, John, forward lets advance?
We so perform, we took the king of France
With as much toil as Phillips son did take
Darius: we the French kings person wan,
No need there is large prosses for to make,
Or slaughter show how it befell as than
Or prisoners name, but seuenteen earls we wan
With many Lords and knights which we did gain,
And near six thousand one and other slain:
In this strong meddle taken was a knight
The Chattelon of Dampost near alide
Toth Cardnall: th'inflamed prince had sight
Of him: humbly had I not denide,
Distressed Chattelon suddenly had did,
The noble prince took in high dispite
That's master would against him let him fight.
This battle to the French maulpartuis,
Two leagues from Poycters cruel and furious,
Enduring with horrible noise and huis
From prime till noone, the prince desirous
Like stoutest lion t'be victorious,
With princelike courage foes pursues apace
And many knights bears he down in chase.
No heed took I good prisoner rich to gain,
But had regard the prince so well to guide,
Hot, fresh, and young, wherefore I ply my pain
As duty would, lest harm should him betide,
His own desire was I should abide
His person near, in thickest of the fraies,
He credits what I speak: to my great praise.
All as we would: glad prince did frank bestow
A stately supper t'prisoner king and praid
His good content, though buisnes against him go,
For your own self renowned king he said,
Your prowes past all those to you obaid,
Byth true censure of our best skilled knights
The sovereign praise you wan in all the fights.
What triumphing in England known these news
At Burdeux, what great reioicing seen
In foreign courts how honored all our crewes
Where they became? my service as I ween
That here I did was highly in esteem,
About a prince men thought me meet to be
As well for counsel as for cheualrie.
King John int'England gladly was conueid
On trampling steed through London does he ride:
Note fortunes change a king that scepter sweid
With large command, through noble France does bide,
In foreign land: there pricking him beside
His conqueror on cole black hobbie plast,
On whom the woondring vulgars praises blast.
No Romain in his triumphs glorious
Through city passing with trumpets sounding
More apparent appeered victorious,
Than our brave prince by modest riding
At peoples plause with joy abounding,
Remembering those high words he erst did say,
Never shall England ransom for me pay.
Betwixt the kings there grew agreement,
And if performd then back John should retier.
The peers of France denide their kings intent,
Whereat king Edward stormd with furious yer,
And vowed their plague with wastfull sword and fire
Until they grant the thing which he thought good:
Strongly prepared he past the swelling flud,
Lands at Callis, thence marches in array
With bravery such and show of martial might,
In goodly armors dect so fine and gay,
All beat with Arms fine banners tossing light,
On us dan Phoebus ioyd to have a sight,
With fauning face he seemd on us to smile
We fresh be seen reflection cast the while.
Undoubtedly in all the world was not
More noble band than here were present now,
What knight was he that honor had not got,
In some strange land well shone his virtue how
For leader good a man might him allow,
Most happy realm, thrice happy is that king
Whose subjects fame in foreign regions ring:
First if the prince of Wales I should recite,
Or Henry Duke late Darbie Earl before,
Or Reignald Cobham that much renowned knight,
Lord Mowbray, Manny, Basset, with great store,
Lord Audley, Willoughby, and many more
Than now I show: what if I tell my name
And say that Chandos was not lest in fame.
Fame our names imblasoned not so far
For tennise play or handling of a lute,
Nor dancing fine or glistering as a star,
As women dressed in most unseemly suit,
Our chiefest music trumpe and checking flute,
Our dance, our march: our tennise often to feel,
Thundering blows: our clothing tried steel.
Through Picardie and Artoys spoyld we pass
Int fertile Cambray making there some stay,
In former places found we little grass,
Toward Thyriach we martch anon away
Till foulding siege to City Reames we lay,
Which country was so wasted and so foild
That all our horse for want well ny were spoyld:
Sir Barthelmew Burwash whilst siege does hold,
My self, Lord Audley, and Lord Mucedent,
Sir Richard Pontchardon, a prudent knight and bold
agreed all fowr, and with our troops we went
To Chalous in Campayne, for ventures bent
We approcht strong Cragney a castle hey,
Whereas two knights courageous captains be
Ton Caples called: who bare in golden shield
An ancred cross of sables: we asseild
Rudely the hold, from whence some one did weild
A mighty stone, that head a pieces peild
Of Lord Mucedent: but it was not field,
For to revenge his hard mischance again
Took the hold and all the soldiers slain.
Seven weeks at Reames the king made his abode,
and forage faild and men began to want,
For still we knights the country over rode,
Whereby each thing waxed exceeding scant,
Then to remove the king and nobles mant,
Chalous, Troys, and countries near we wast
Passing the river Muson at the last.
So forth we marched keeping same ordinance
At first ordaind to Aguyllon we came,
Did hawk and hunt passing in pleasaunce,
Often tried our horse and used warlike game,
Which still among, much did the Frenchmen tame,
Nothing unless too hot for us could stay
T'heauie or cold but we did bear away.
Sweeping from hence to Paris ward apace
The county of Neuers and Gastenoys we waste,
Raunge at our wills continuing forth our race
Until that we at Burge le royne were plast
Two leagues fro Paris: and so the town we facst.
Well famed France might wail, for naught but flame
Was to be found in bowels of the same:
Where Meroue puissant warrier raind
Whom fierce Attila overthrew in fight,
Where Charles le main that many kingdoms gaind,
In all Europa feared for his might,
Unconstant fortune taking so far flight,
Sometimes the yoke on others shoulders laid
With biting snaffle now are strongly staid:
From Burg le royne to Mont le herri we
In sightly wise our battles all do draw,
Our constant dealing when the french Lords see
Perseuering still in France to make a flawe
Consuming all as fire does the straw,
Unto a peace to move our king they meant
Their Chaunclor and their learned counsel sent.
They understood our king would not depart
Till pleasing peace he conquered as he voud,
Which thing near touched duke Charles his tender heart,
And nobles for own harms too hawtie proud
Fair conditions twixt them were aloud,
By thundering storm which God from heaven sent
And knotted hail our king does first relent:
A written deed at Charters there was framd
Betwixt the kings, their heirs, allies and friends,
In which fair towns, strong castles all were namd
toth king and his were given for amends
For passed pain, and so the strife it ends,
More Castles, Towns, more Cities and more ground
Were given then in England could be found.
Some speeches were brave dukedom to enclose
Of Britton, in the charter of this peace:
Yet do they not of it so well dispose
So as fresh wars in that place did not cease,
How track of time hard bound does of release
Charles thoughts vpbound within his stubborn breast,
Them forth to loose supposed now his best.
Home went his grace, soon I repasse the seas
As regent and lieuetenant for my king
Taking the oaths, possessions and the keas,
Of Lords, Cities, Castles, which did wringe
Some Frenchmens hearts like percing adders sting:
Great grief it was subiuged to be bound
To strangers most discourteous they had found:
I stewards, bailifes and captains do ordain
As liked me: and this when I had done
Came to Nyort, there purposd to remain,
Keeping estate whereby men's hearts I won
Largely I spent most like a Princes son,
In plentious fare bountiful and much,
King Edwards love and lowance to me such:
His royal love to me was passing rare,
Numbers thought I did deserve no less,
Courteous I aduisd and would not spare
But liberal be, fraught with temperatenesse,
Fair points of honor would I not disgresse,
Amongst brave Lords, fair Ladies, I esteemd
Of great estates in gentle favor deemd:
Forth of the charter was except the land
Saint Saluiour, sir Godfrey Harecourts late,
Who Pollux like at Constantine did stand
To his defense, when slain was every mate
With weldie axe, his stroke so heavy sat,
Not prowdest enemy durst sad blows abide
Till at the length two horsemen at him ride
Inragd bear down a knight most cheualrous,
Which stradling set his legs to stand more suer
On surest leg: and there dispiteous
They bear him down who fights whilst he may duer,
Live still his praise and glory fresh in ure,
For wisdom and prooude skill in martial facts
No living knight one jot exceeds his acts.
With plainest difference of Earl Harcourts race
In glorious red two golden bars did bear:
Daring against foe toth utterance show his face,
Which tried he was well worthy arms to wear,
Amongst his foes that durst them nobly rear,
The home made knight that never ward in field
Small title has unto a noble shield.
In his past life his land he did behest
To my good king and he to me it gave,
Toth valiant John of France he made request
For his consent that I the same might have:
He gently sealed to what the king does crave,
I it enioid well worth in yearly rent
Of hundred franks fifteen: which free I spent
Most bountifully, amongst soldiers bold
To gallant men my purse was never closd,
Which caused that as often as I would
I had companions, valiants lads disposd
To warlike feats, that strongest holds have posd:
Sweet behavior ioind to liberal hand
Reasons I was with manly soldiers mand.
Brave Duke of Lancaster mars his Henry did,
Whilst I at Nyort kept so high estate
Fair cosen German to the king allide,
Good gentle Duke, lamented was thy fate
Among valiant knights thou nobly ledst of late,
When as thou did with Darbie title rain
As after when the Dukedom thou did gain:
In battelous Arms before the king of France
Like Pallas knight thou entredst royal list,
Against Brownswick Duke, full bent to prove the chance
Of doubtful combat, the king cause why it mist
Staid the event: great eithers loss he wist.
This Brownswick Duke tried strong champion bold
Bare fair in red two lions passant gold.
True golden fame, black death cannot defile,
Glistering honor buds from dustie grave,
Each noble Lord that bears glorious style
Spend must his life eternal praise to have,
As thou high Duke did honor ever save,
Most mighty God let England never want
Such noble Lords true honor seek to plant.
In England cause the prince kept princely port
Most like himself: the counsel thoughten best
Int' Acquitaine that he should make resort,
Partly for that the Gascoins do request
His presence: and revenues largely rest
His noblenes right noble to uphold.
And Gascoin Lords desire that he would
Repasse the seas: he answers their desiers
Once landed, careful I to meet him well
Accompaned, with knights and youthful squiers
On coursers mounted decked every sell,
And receiving him at warlike Rochell
We thence attended unto Poycters town
As reason wild and duty had us bowne:
Of Acquitaine I Cunstable was ordaind,
High honors given and feastings to me made
Continually his favor more I gaind,
Through enterprises of account I wade,
Noble exploits I end by skillful trade,
Which plaisd him so as he loud me ever
Because in honor still I do persevere:
Peter of Lusignon King of Cypress I Will
Made means to all the Kings of Christendom.
From iarring discord to abstain a while
Help to repulse the miscreants late come
Their borders near: and much of neighbors wone.
Had been in Italy, France, and Almaine,
In Flaunders, England, came to Acquitaine:
Not when swift fame had pierced hautie skies
Admetus praise which made Apollo bow
Down from estate, to view with leeuing eyes
His bountifulnes, which seen made him allow
So well of it, and further did avowe
Fame sparing was: yet suer my Prince exceeds
The praises of Admetus lib'rall deeds.
For when he hard of this strange kings ariue,
He sent me forth with knights accompaned
In gentleness could with right courteous strive:
At kings first entrance he saw well placed
Forty knights so many squiers faced,
All for the honor of Lady Princes
Fair was the iusts each proved blamles:
More sign of love, more show of princely power,
Rare welcoms given, fine courtesies withal,
Of courtesy sweet prince a pearls flower:
Nor wandering king did never see nor shall
More store of knights in earthly regents hall.
The prince me will to take him to my guide
Him plesaunce show in his dominions wide:
A vermile cross the Cyprian king still wore,
For holy voyage he had undertake
Against the Turk: his soueraign to adore
In glorious Arms: a party prince to make
He wild, and found to no good service slake
Our loved prince: departed well content,
Great intercourse of loves betwixt them blent.
Thus having been most kindly intertaind,
By me: and stout sir Thomas Phelton much,
Sir Neal Loring, sir Simon Basset, daind
Him well to treat: sir Baldwine Fr^uile such
His kindness showed, as spite could not but gruch
To see the like: he safely went his way
The principality through I him convey.
King John of France into England past
Brave king, fair queen, gay nobles for to see
Through true firm love which does eternal last
Whers fained love, small iars remembered be,
No virtues more in phear of high degree
Than were resiant in this sovereign,
Whose worthy praises ever may remain.
Bloody parcas what meanest thou to sheare
His vital twine so worthy longer life,
Can thou, pale malice, such priuly virtues bear?
Than bluntest coulter duller be thy knife:
Amongst best things thou mischief ever rife:
But mighty God often takes away the best
For our bad sins, or for to ease his blessed.
Whilst this good king in England made his stay,
Him sickness took with sharp incresment sore
And strong oppresment at Sauoy where he lay,
Death does approach then flesh can breath no more
His loss king Edward greatly does deplore,
From England Parris: to stately tomb conueid,
And Charles his son the Regal scepter sweid:
Oh vading flower why flatterest thou thy self
In pompeous seat of mighty majesty,
Frail honors titles or foul wasting pelf,
Forgetting great eternal dignity,
Scorneth mightiest earthly Imperie:
What low inferior fears of you amiss
That high superior threts again ywis.
Sir John Montfort in th'aprill of his youth
Gay Arms began weld: and with success begone
In Britton: to sir Charles of Bloys his ruth,
This fair new knight was that brave Countess son
Of whom I spoke: Bloys hearing what was don
By him, and how he sieged strong Alroy,
And with sharp war the country does destroy,
Told king Charles: who aiding cosen Bloys,
Sent sir Bertram Glesquine who does entreat
Knights such he knew of whom he had good choice,
Him to assist in ventrous warlike feat:
Sir Bertrams praises now were waxen great.
King Charles him had in reverence and account
In praisfull virtues cause he does surmount.
Young Earl Mountfort of their assembly hard,
Sealed letters into Acquitaine does send
To some good knights telling how he fard,
Especially he writ to me his friend
Willing my presence, helpful to defend
His heritage: I soon agreed to go
If my good prince would say it should be so.
I license crave for this departaunce,
If that thereby I might not break the peace,
The prince said no breach: and releasaunce
Gave unto me and others, who not cease
Him to beseech my numbers to increase,
Through Xanton, Poyictow I pass unto Alroy
Friendly welcomd with no little joy,
Of Earl John and many a valiant knight,
Accouting all themselves in safety now
So long as me amongst them have they might,
My counsel their opinions so allow,
And it was not long ear some plain told hus how,
Sir Charles Bloys accompaned does advance
In best appoint that has been seen in France,
And fast approcht: which news when so I knew
I placed me where coming I behold
A seemly band, as eye did ever vewe,
And goodly dight as heart desire cold,
Oftlie returning unto friends I told,
That I had seen of noblenes the flower
For discipline in ordring of a power,
One cannot cast a glove from off his hand
But it on Lance will or on basnet light,
So properly in order plast they stand,
Their leader is a Lord of great insight,
They have us taught our battails soon to dight:
My friends then said, sir you our Chieftaine are
Please you command and all we will prepare?
Though young Earl were sovereign in the place,
To Martial buisnesses yet I tend
By princely letters from King Edwards grace
To me, he wild the Earldome to defend
Heedy for this, my time here well to spend:
Three battails then I ordered with good have,
And in the first sir Robert Canole plast
Lord of Duriuall, hardy Britton borne
Sir Oliver Clisson the next does guide
Whom Lion white in red crowned, does adorn.
The third fresh Earl, with whom my self abide,
Him well t'aduise for doubt what might betide,
Reregard of five hundred men I made,
To sir Hugh Caueley these few words I said,
Sir knight, this company I appoint to you,
Withdraw your self and choose some piece of ground,
From thence not buge unless you plainly vewe
Us to disrout, then hasting in that stound
Us reunited to place retier you round,
Lately left: there tending like do stay
More better service can no man do this day.
When stout sir Hue all hard my speeches pass
Right shamefast waxt, and thus in haste replide:
Such charge to take he never minded was
With fervent words flatly the same denide,
Half angry asking what weakness I espide
In body his, with foremost not to fight,
Willing the gifter to some other wight.
Advisedly to him I answered,
Your valor sir I passing tried know,
Your high desiers I thoroughly measured
Strong ablenes to fight in foremost row,
Because right sage and wise your self I know
This charge I give, wishing you that place
In which you shall acquier thankful grace,
With honor and applause amongst the best,
And furthermore I faithful promise give
To you sir knight, to grant the first request
You shall demand if that John Chandos live,
My rightful treating herein do not deprive:
This noble soldier tookt still in dispite
He might not in the front of battle fight.
Whose settled mind to see well near I weep,
Him to that pass it commen was I told
He or my self the reregard must keep,
Which better was, allow his judgment should,
Confusd he staid, yet take the charge he would,
For which salt tears distill from manly eyes
Departs to ground that fittest he espies:
A Baron rich in Britton there did dwell
Lord Beumanoyr, a prisoner safely sworn
Us English too: which thought he might do well
Spending his time fell strife might out be worn,
To pass between of both sides was he borne,
By his spent travel so much he brought to pas
As one whole day and night of truce there was:
Gay Phoebus lodgd fair Luna pressed in place,
Our English soldiers most requested me
Largely telling the poorenes of their case
With much expense, that I should not agree
To peace: determined to win or die
By battle: to whom I easily give consent
As one thereto by inclination bent.
Chaste Cynthia gone, Aurora blushed
Lord Beumanoyr betime was stirring
From his camp toward us his footings sped,
In hope to speed: I soon departing
We salued at our first incountring:
He wild I would endeavor to accord
These parties for the goodness of our Lord.
Contrary to his just desiering
I answered, good sir of Beumanoyr?
I counsel that you haste retiering
From whence you came, our companies deuoyr
Is you t'inclose, and slaie as destroier
Of their desiers: they so hate talk of peace
Therefore herein your best is for to ceace,
And furthermore tell to sir Charles of Bloys,
Earl John this day will Duke of Britton be
Or slain abide, shunning other choice:
When this rich Baron hard these words of me,
Said Chandos, Chandos? as good will as ye,
Or your young Lord, my Lord has to the fray
Calm peace yet offers if you said not nay.
We both depart and both to friends return,
I scarcely ariud Earl Mountfort asked
What news? for he in longing thoughts does burn.
I told him now that he was hardly tasked,
But fairest truth I fouliest masked:
Lord Beumanoyr has sent you word by me,
This day your foe will Duke of Britton be,
Or else this day he will not breath at all:
Which message told he color seemd to change
Willed t'aduance and straight to battle fall,
T'inflame his courage I from truth did range
Somewhat to make the matter seem more strange,
I said advise, whether you will fight or leave.
Yes by Saint George: our banner forward heave.
Lord Beumanoyr his answer likewise framd
Saying, he had the prowdest langage hard
Of me, that ever erst: forth to Bloys he namd
What were my words, but more he plain declard
How that all right I said clean him debard
From truest title to great dukedom quite.
He does reply: God knows whose is the right.
The Ermine banners of the dukedom right
Were placed, each against other orderly,
To see brave Lords under their pennons dight
All beat with Arms bedecked properly,
So feateously both battles beautify,
As to the gaser well it might appear
That all the Vallewer in the world was here.
As raging tides about some Ilsland meet
In stredned channel forced by a prime,
With like encounter both our battles greet
Like bustling rage was showed at this time,
Red sprinkling blood our weapons does begrime,
A brauer battle better fought by skill
Was never seen our present age until.
Our enemies more than we in number were
And opened us by strength of fighting well,
Sir Hugh Caueley, quickly succord there,
Beat back fierce foes, eger, stout and fell,
Four times that the very truth to tell,
His silver banner, with gulie fes in sight
Between three calves of sables, set us right.
Like armed Mars with weldie axe in hand
Complet formd and full of valiantnes,
In hammered steel strongly do I stand,
Full fraught with strength as well as hardines,
Few durst abide me in my furiousnes,
The Earl I wild to do now this or that,
He me beleeud, whereby much fame he gat:
On th'erle of Aucer and fierce French I set
With courage such as they discomfit were,
To say the truth right valiant knights we met
As by prooud virtue plain they made appear
Which naught auaild: by strength was taken there
Th'erle of Aucer, Iognie, and Lord of Preer,
Rich Norman baron ransom cost him deer:
Their banners torn and cast down to the ground,
Their company in maruels mischief then,
In battle if that one to flee be found
He causes three, if three, there flies ten,
If ten, twenty, and then a hundred men.
When given them was this strong ouerthro,
On Glesquine I and sturdie Brittons go,
Where many a mighty feat of Arms was done,
Where many heavy sounding blow was given,
Where many a prisoner rescude was and won,
Where many a basnet was a sunder riuen,
Where many a man dead to the earth was driven:
Hot Earl of Raix, who maruels wrought that day
I prisoner took and swore with me to stay,
Under my pennon was bravely taken here
Sir Bertram Glesquine, then all fled that might
Excepting some that held their Lord full deer
Which strong unite and sharply began to fight,
But thither straight my self and power I dight,
Then was achieved many a feat of Arms,
Slain were our foes and beaten down by swarms:
Here murdered was Right noble gentle knight
Sir Charles of Bloys, his face toward his foes:
For so it was determind over night
Ton of these Earls unto his ending goes,
Our enemies the selfsame thing dispose,
Both parts resolud this day should be the last
Betwixt these Earls, and so the dice were cast:
No man of honor almost does escape,
For when they forced were to fearful flight
Much mischief fell, for many knights mishape
For cruel slaughter, happened in this fight
The scambling chase eight leags endurd right,
Ending almost at the gate of Reans
And some our friends in it good booties geans:
This battle finished was near to Alroy
Whilst Phoebus in the balance wandered,
The present year of man's eternal joy,
A thousand threescore and three hundred,
And single four, as some have numbered,
Earl Montforts banner on high bush was pight,
Returning friends of it might have a sight:
As each commander foes left to pursue
From weary chase he thither might him get,
Long time it was or all together drew,
Much joy was made when as we all were met,
My Guydhome next unto th'earls Ermins set
Sir Eustace Dabscote, sir Matthew Gorney,
Bare palie gold and Azure euenley,
Sir Robert Canole, sir John Bouchier came,
Sir Walter Huet, sir Hue Caueley stout,
For this days service worthy lasting fame,
Who ordered us we ginning to disrout,
From among his friends strong foes he beats out,
I wild the Earl to joy at his good hap
Since he was placed in dame Fortunes lap,
He said your prowes it sir knight atchiud
all knights so think that here with us remain,
Deserved honor ought not to be depriud,
Next unto God by you I battle gain,
And drinking recht a flagon glad and feign
To me: and said, drink now to our good speed,
And thus on conquest gladed thoughts do feed,
As joyful meriment was in making now
All chaffed from the chase like wounded bore,
Sir Oliver Clisson, with eye beat from his browe
Comes bringing with him prisners noble store,
Though his great wound did grieve him very sore,
Approaching yet light from his courser down,
Et fut receue come cheualier asses boune.
Now to Duke John by Heralds word was brought
His late rival dead they saw to lie,
Then said the Duke he shall of me be sought,
I rather would in such estate him spy
Then for the Dukedom striving armd to be,
When slain he saw him covered with his shield
He wept, but soon I took him from the field:
More needful cause had I to weep alas
Then he, because I caused so his death,
And from that place I willed him to pas,
For sir quoth I, even thus the matter swaieth,
By this man's end the Dukedom with you staieth,
On these great Lordships fie upon them all
That are possessed by others deadly fall:
To Guingant Town good Earl of Bloys was borne,
In reverent sort he there entombed lies,
Whose name the Clargie do so much adorn
With martiers crown for truths defense that dies,
A heavy clog might on my conscience pries
That would no peace, until this Earl were ded,
Almighty God causd me with like be sped.
For measure such as we to other meat
Is often unlooked remeasured again,
By iustest God from his tribunal seat:
Wherefore great Lords that now in world do rain
Warelie heed what harm to selves you gain,
And all your doings peasd with temperaunce
Brings quiet end freed from anoyaunce:
This valerous hap soon blasted was abroad
How by my counsel had Lord Mountfort don,
Which caused many me with praise to load
When known how knightly we the battle won:
Displeasd king Charles, frail Fortune so did run,
Much sorrow he for cosen Bloys does make,
And much for Glesquine and for others sake:
Duke Mountfort letters writ of credence
Unto king Edward, ioifully he sent
By a Poursuuant, performing diligence
Found the king, and showed how buisnes went,
For which good news he so his favor bent
As for a Herald true he him allowd
Surnamed Windsore fairly him indowd.
We hold the fields, win Towns and Castles strong,
Wasting, spoiling, conquering as we go,
Cold king of France took counsel ear too long
Wise message sent Earl Mountforts mind to kno,
The Dukedom whether he would hold or no
Of him: but then, Lord Latimear was sent
Int' England for to know the kings intent:
Which understood these parties do accord,
That our young Earl should Duke of Britton be,
But lowly homage, now he must afford
Unto king Charles, and so they all agree
Without heirs mals if that he hap to die
It shall descend unto the Bloys his son,
Still quiet now and brawling wars are done.
Our Irish seas do never rage so rough
When northern winds does on their billows smite,
As though they would the threatening rocks so tough
Make level with their calmnes for dispite,
And ouldest pilote from passage does affright,
Yet brething Zephirus can their raging slake
As gentle as the meanest standing lake:
How soon great God can rage of wars alaie,
For where but late the trembling mother cride
Dreading her babe: in safety does she play,
None careful now their treasures close to hide,
None watches now for doubt what may betide,
Britton but now, with bluddie wars did rage,
And now fair concord does all fury swage.
Now does wear the great Castilian Crown
Dan Peter: whose extremest rage was such
As on him all his chiefest nobles frown,
And vulgar commons at his doing gruch,
Some said his deeds whole Christendom did tuch,
The Pope, the French, and Arragon agree,
Him to depose and Henry plast to be:
And for that cause the foresaid states do pay
Sir Bertram Glesquins ransom unto me,
For hundred thousand franks I said not nay,
From his gagd fiaunce clear I set him free,
These states request me into their journey,
As one to rule, and special room to bear,
I flat refusd my liking was not there.
Yet certain of my princes knights did go:
When these troops assembled were in Spain
They thirty thousand soldiers were and mo,
When each considered the evil rain
Of Peter, and the nobles he had slain
They him depose, and Henry do adorn
As king, although Alphonsus bastard borne:
Thus he possessed: bestows right largely
And soldiers bountiful him account:
To Siuile city first in haste does fly
Forsaken king, thence to high sea does mount
Accompaned with Dan Casters, in count
Faithful knight: to Galitia ward amain
Making sail, there of one castle feign
Called Coulone: on craggie cliffe strong plast,
Distressed self, wealth, children, and treasure,
There doubting staid, sent trusty knight in haste
T'acquitain, with letters showing the seasure
Of bastard Henry's, wrongful displeasure,
Unto my Prince: who thought too hard event
Was fallen on him and too sharp punishment:
Spiteful Fortune great enemy to those
Of high degree, what pastime can thou take?
Through turning times thy self so to dispose
Of mighty king mean fugitive to make,
But peevish self thou all men wilt forsake:
To highest things peasd level do thou ame,
At sharpest falls thou make sporting game,
A king but late unto whose only beck
Whole Castile bowd: lives like a prisner pend,
Dares not appear for fear of too great check
And stateliest troops of nobles with attend,
Remayns one knight like, sad AEneas friend
Large countries late obeid his bending will,
And now possessed but barren basest hill:
The Prince called me these letters in his hand
And brave sir Thomas Phelton speedily,
In most princely favor we highly stand,
Sir Knights quoth he, strange news is come to me
Which unto you shall soon imparted be,
Which don he wild as was his usage
Our opinions to so great voyage,
Then presently a parliament was called,
To which repaird the noble Gascoine knights,
Arminack, Gomigines, Dalbreth stald
In highest rooms: from hence four worthy Wights
T'england sent as reason wills of rights:
King Edward he our journey does allow,
Fresh John of Gaunt to go with us does vow.
Without delay into Nauar were wild
Sir Thomas Phelton and my self to fleet,
We so exploit with journey labring hild,
As with the king at Pampelune we meet,
From loved prince him do we nobly greet,
He promisd be, at Bayon by a day,
With courteous leave we home return our way.
Our prince, dan Peter both do meet him there,
With parle much at last he condescends
Hard passages to open that straightest were,
For which dan Peter promisd for amends
The Groine, and country shoring that extends
To Sauater, and more a hundred thousand franks,
Thus he an aid toth prince and all his ranks.
The prince two heralds does dispatch with speed,
To Castile ward, giving his knights to kno
The purposd war, and what he had decreed,
His pleasure known, they came king Henry fro,
But why they part they little to him sho:
Then Caueley, Dabscote, and bold Huet was,
Gay sir John Deuereux, all thence do pass
Companions some hard not so soon this news,
Safe to return much toiling they endure,
King Henry closely up all passage mewes,
In dangerous state remain the most unsure,
The prince doubted his enemies might allure
Them to their wills, which well twelve hundred were
Of pyked men in welding shield or spear,
At th'entrie of Foix inclosd they stay
And may not pas, th'erle does flat forbid
Them t'enter in his country any way,
Most noble prince of message send me did
Toth Earl of Foix, and show him he would rid
Him of these men, and that what harm they should
His country do, that he remend it would.
The Earl accords to their safe passage:
I chaffer so as them I wholly hier,
Among whom in wars full many a trusty gage
All which one word would work to my desire,
To busy prince I hastily retier:
These waged soldiers do themselves divide
By companies, toard Acquitaine they ride,
Toward Toulouse some, their rediest journey take
At Mountabon the river seek to pass,
Sir Guy Dazay and Earl of Narbone make
Quick sommons, and of soldiers gether a mass,
Sir John Comes Mountabons captain was:
The French toth town sent courrors riding
T'see if companions would be stirring:
Sir John demands why thus in armors dressed
They came t'inuade the principality?
They chaffing said our enemies with you rest
Whom we will rouse for their iniquity,
Sir John, sir John you know not courtesy,
If thus you harbor the pillars of the land
Here be their foes will wake them out of hand:
Lords he replide, here be some men of war
Into Montaubon lately entered,
That with my Lord the prince retained ar
And him must serve as is indented
Better undone than soon repented,
Advise you well ere forward you proceed,
My princes frowns you have good cause to dreed.
But when our men tried and aduenterous,
Threatening enemies plast before them see
To hazard battle hard and dangerous
They meant: ordaining each thing feateouslie
Though pressing enemies far more numbers be:
Sir John Comes, his soldiers all armed
Then to assist great need required,
Sir Perducas Dalbreth, sir Robert Cheney,
Pass all before, requesting safe they might
Go by in peace, the Frenchmen fierce deny:
Then suddenly terrible was the fight,
Back to the town our men were beaten right
Nandon of Begerant, and Burg of Bertvell,
Had rid all night and came in time so well
Unto their aid: as foes were take or slain,
Rich prisoners were won and fienced
Upon their faiths: which lost our men there gain,
For with their oaths the Pope dispensed,
Whereof our captains to me complained,
And wild redress in this they thoughten wrong
To me of Arms the judgment did belong:
To cipher plainly how brave Lords did cum
gaily beseen with valiant numbers,
How Lord Dalbreth was countermand his sum
Of thousand spears: whereat he woonders,
Or else what lets peect buisnes sunders,
Or all winter t'shew the princes charge
Where things past count asking recital large,
With buisnes much we pearse into Nauare,
With toiling more some streights we got beand
Which asperous, foul and stiep^e doubtless are,
Mantled with snow was all t'high mountain land,
Horse nor man scarce on their feet might stand,
Our army closd, in three we do divide
That one might pass whilst other two abide:
On monday armd like youthful Troyilus
And fresh as he in all his iolitie,
As stirring, weldie, and as cheualrous
As Chaucer makes him in felicity,
Past John of Gaunt: and with him passed I,
Twelve hundred pensils under me remain
Wrought with my arms that glisteren on the plain.
On twesday past our Hector princely,
Spanish Peter: and Charles king of Nauare:
Lewis Harcourt, in barons dignity,
Sir Thomas Phelton well dressed for war,
His brother William of self had little care
King of Malorques on wensday over came
Accompaned with Lords of peereles fame,
Earl Arminak, Dalbreth bold Gascoynes all,
Pomiers, Gomigines, and stout Mucident,
And of Buiff courageous capital,
Lord Clisson, and sir Robert Canol went,
Barnerdle Sall, that was to scaling bent,
Of Rounceuauls we have forsake the streights
Which flieng Fame to bastard Henry beits.
And more how we strong Sauatar had won,
Placed at the entry into Spain,
When storming king all hard what we had don
He sommons forced, and does such numbers gain,
Entering in arms into the open plain,
Which news foreriders to the prince have told,
Who says the bastard valiant is and bold:
The cherefull trumpet sounds to addres,
Fresh knights furbishen armors hastily:
And many squiers to stir up hardines
The noble prince does knight immediately:
Some made the duke, and some were made by me:
But th'ennimie battle does deny before
Brave Frenchmen come in number forty score.
Right warlike band which bold sir Bertram led,
And wise sir Arnole Cleped Dandrehen,
With heedie toiling wairie journey sped
At Spannish camp ariuing with their men,
It hapt unto king Henry's brethren when
They new were come to ride our host to view
With the attempt some haples overthrew,
Strike fierce into the Canton where I set
The watch: I stirring they recoile with speed,
Returning they with both the Pheltons met,
Which forth were rid to do some valiant deed,
With hundreds two well Armed for their need,
Sir Richard Cauton, sir Hugh Hastings
With other knights of fair proceedings,
These Spaniards six thousand were no less,
And when our English once they had espide,
Which little mountain t'aue had in distress
With shooting joy amain they toard them ride,
Where many a skillful feat of war was tried,
But in the end they were all take but one
And he too rash does lose himself alone:
For when he saw proud Spaniards placed
In leueld plain, his sharp gleiue he takes,
His hard resisting shield he soon embraced,
Toward the thickest speedy have he makes,
One stroke he dead: then bright sword he shakes
So vigorously, in his threatening hand
And stroke, and foynd, and lasht, whilst he might stand.
Armed he was in red most glorious,
Two Ermin Lions passant crowned gold,
With Scottish treasure diffrence spacious,
His brother and his friends the fight behold,
And saw his ending too aduenterous bold:
Raging furor, fair knighthood does confound.
Sir William Phelton brought dead to ground.
Spaniards of fair adventure ioyious,
The leaders were king Henry's brethren
Their journey to their brother prosperous
They glad declare, show prisoners taken,
Great thanks he gave: and residue threaten,
Soft stepped forth a soldier bold and wise,
Praying the king heerin to take advise:
Sir save your grace: your speech I not gain say,
But yonder is armed many a proved knight
As ever rangde in battelous affray,
Hardy in Arms and matchles in strong might,
If with stout prince you do assemble fight,
You Will find no fliers what so ere betide
Twixt life and death toth vntraunce they will abide,
In reverent sort unto your grace I speak,
Abstain from war, let fierce enemies be,
Contagious air will make their strongest weak,
Your country left behind them shall you see,
They pincht with want it so will chance that we
May fight with them, who present are the flower
Of cheualrie, of wisdom, and of power.
Marshall replide the king, I so desire
The princes power with good power to meet,
He shall not (by my fathers soul) retier,
Till him I do in joined battle greet,
Seven thousand I have armed head and feet
Of genetors full twenty thousand more,
And threescore thousand: which have truly swore
Me not to fail, therefore sir Arnole I
A basht to be, may seem to have no cause,
Stout willing numbers vowed have with me to die.
Yet full six days upon these things they pause:
We forward come compeld by hungers lawse,
The swift river near to the groyne we pass,
Where as we find a better soil for grass.
At entrance first when we approached Spain
King Henry sealed letter sent our Prince,
Requesting knowledge and the title plain
Why so with power he sought him to convince,
The Herald was retained ever since
He came till now: wherein seven weeks spent
Now back by him his answer thus he sent,
That his true cosen he was come to aid
In rightful cause as justice does desire,
Therefore, quoth he, Earl Cristmer having waid
Your great wrong thus to the Crown t'aspier,
Am come in arms, but yet I fair requier
You both t'accord, right king to have the crown,
Your self rich lands: but if at this you frown
Then you chief cause of slaughter, spoil and blood
Which I God knows am passing loath to sheed,
I wish you would well ponder of the good
We offer: and not trust th'uncertaine speed
Of fickle chance, so careless in hit heed,
Here rest your friends if that you say not nay,
Dated from Groyne in March the thirtith day.
This Herald gone, his letters red with all,
Sir Bertram said now shortly shall we have
A do: therefore O noble King let call
Each officer, his charge to order brave,
The hawtie prince does naught but battle crave,
Replide the king, I little do him dreed,
Good hope is of a furtherance to the speed:
Int' three their fights: the first sir Bertram lad,
Aduentrous French and strangers where with him
Th'erls of Dancell, and sanxes second had
Greatly renowned cause they late did win,
The third stout King, martial passing trim,
A hundred thousand the one and other were
Right nobly seen before up decked appear:
As busy king pricketh from rank to rank,
Nearer Naueret we a little drew,
Where they behold us raised on a bank
From under which we all the valleys view,
Couerd with helms: whose banners some I knew
Against me ear this reasd had they been and borne,
Taken and beat, and all too pieces torn.
Sir Bertram Glesquine thimperiall egle bare
In silver, gulie baston over all:
Six white spur rowels Dandrahen does rear
In field of red, a checkered fes does stall
Of th'on and the other color: then I call
My banner for, vproled I hit bring
Unto my Prince, in presence Spanish king,
Beloved Lord behold my banner hear,
Vouchsafe the pains it to unfold for me,
Granting license this day it up to rear,
Thanks good Father yours: and your large bounty,
Fair lands I hold t'maintaine it in degree.
The Prince, and King as two that all us rules
Disuellope silver a sharpened pile of gules:
Right well they wish: with duty I depart
To my good friends companions feareles,
Take here my banner and yours with good heart,
Which all you bear in greatest buisnes,
I said I know your valuers peareles:
All plast on foot, all ordered be so well,
That prieng spite would say we did excel:
Here mighty prince the cristall skies beheld
Praieng to God the journey might be ours,
Advance he cride God shall the buisnes weld:
Duke John and I fierce charge the stragers powers
Dashing with force, as some mighty towers
Together rusht, right long lasts the fraie
Or either could be opened any way:
Much foyning here with spears and axes fell,
Much rushing here with shields and pauish strong,
Much striving here each other to excel,
Much struggling here as happens in like throng,
And by much strength we mix each other among,
Amongst the rest was I feld to the ground,
And Spannish captain fallen on me I found
Called Martine Ferrant: greatly in esteem
Amongst his nation for his woorthines,
In dangerous fury I drew a knife full keen
That often I wore, and through true valiantnes
I deadly wounded Martine dredles,
Slain he abides, straight up rose I again
Rescude by right valiant friends with pain.
Like chaffed Lion escaped from the toil,
Amide his foes fell ragd in angry mood,
Here biting one, there doing other foil,
Inflamd I fare as furious Lion wood,
Amongst the French tried matchles soldiers good,
Excepting us, we forced them t'open
Whereby array and order all was broken.
Well to report, they knightly did their power
Us to resist which prooud companions were
Sir Robert Cheney, sir Perducas a flower,
In mars his field: sir Robert Bricquet there
Laid him about: too long to name them here
Fierce foughten so as wonder it was to see:
All these bold French or slain or taken be.
Too sloe I praise courageous John of Gaunt
Like Priams son strong broyling mid his foes,
All timorousnes from him bed he auaunt,
And boldly in amongst the thickest throes,
Such poissant, weldie and so thick his bloes,
Whom sound he hits with staggring steps does reel
They knew it sure that his sad thundering feel.
Sir Bertram and sir Arnold taken were,
I taking none attended to the fight,
Yet many a Lord about me taken nere,
On King Henry we drive with all our might,
Who showed himself a kingly leader right,
Most terrible and stormy grew the fray,
And stout Henry did many fliers stay.
Princely Edward mirror of Cheualrie,
Accompaned with martial puissance
So hot assaild the enemies fast do fly,
Recovering horse some swift away do praunce
Desierous Henry with gentle semblaunce
Returned them often: brave Edward beat them thence
As often: for naught against him could ablie fence:
Which pestilence when stout King Henry saw
Assuredly if taken to be slain,
From out so sharp a tempest does withdraw:
Quickly mount we unto our horse again,
Chasing our foes fleeing lost field amain,
Great slaughter and miserable drowning
Of those that sought the rivers passing^
Some do repasse the bridge to Naueret near,
Sad town right fast their flying friends receive,
Hard pursued and surprisde with fear,
Take is the town where many life do leave,
Of trustiest hope we flatly them bereave,
Of saint James grand Prior: chief of Calcan
Both taken here with many a valiant man.
Proud Darius Camp was little richer
When Macedonian soldiers entered,
Gold, silver vessels glorious glister,
Things that increase stout soldiers venture,
To reaching thought these toys no tempter,
Yet meaner soldier that lives by the ware,
Of his maintenance ought to have some care.
Dam Peter would the prisoners all to die,
But gentle Prince their pardons does obtain,
Reason wild him no demand deny,
But lowly said high Prince the realm of Spain
By your good virtue t'me restord again:
When tidings came how Henry safe was fled,
He was perplexed and pesterd in his head.
Thus turning times their changes often have,
Thus fortune frail is moving too and froe,
Thus things that are, do pass, and others crave
Their place: which hasting after them do go,
Mad fortune like unconstant wind does bloe.
What was not is, what is, right soon does cease,
Now ruffling war: then sweet temperat peace.
What sots be we to heed so great a care
For worldlines that no man can combine
In saftie; what dolts sweetest sleep to spare
For earthly trifles slipper then the slime,
No earthly great, but wasted is with time,
He crowned, he fled, he fled and then he crowned,
Regno Regnaui, fortunes wheel goth round.
This act known wrought contrary effects,
Our friends reioyst, there is great sorrow make,
Ours hopt with joy: there is worser ils suspects
Then be: for most men's hearts will quake
Dreding worst till best the better make:
This spanish Peter deals very ill
With noble Prince possessed of his will.
Fairly possessed all Spain is at his beck,
Vanished so great a hundred thousand armd,
Gay fortunes fauns, after frowning check,
Too small a salve where thou so greatly harmd,
Fie on thy spite so many nobles charmd.
For ever long Dam Peter proud was slain,
And bastard Henry crowned king again.
Most countries famd fair prince to highest skies,
Him worthy thought Imperial crown to wear,
Goodly his fame for princely praise does rise:
Three mighty kings by him discomferd were
Of which the brauest he away did bear:
The Other two as Philip, and Henry,
Fast fled the field and feared his cheualrie.
No covenant held king Peter that he sealed,
To our good prince ith vale of olives staid
Sent to him knights, but smally that auaild
Delaying scuces for himself he laid:
Which soundest counsel circumstances waid,
Sir Dandrehen the beugie of vitams were
Exchangd for knights of ours late taken there
Sir Thomas Phelton, sir Richard Cawton,
Sir Hue Hastings, armd gold we do redeem
With gulie manuch, and silver labell on
These taken were, thought act of high esteem
By Henry's brethren dastads plainly seem:
Parching drought and hot infesting air
Causes urging hasty home repair.
Huge vastie Ocean stirred with large wind
High mounting waves demonstrat mighty rage,
So shipmen tossed and toild themselves do find,
Esteeming that storms never will assuage
Till drenched bodies pawned be in gage,
So AEolus huffs, so billows big arise,
As to be lost each man himself does prise:
Unexpected, so gently breaths a calm
As gliding channel smilingly does pas,
The wanton Dolphin dallieth on each walme,
Large sea it self seems as smooth as glass,
Sweet cheerful songs are chaunted for alas
The sayler drinks, quick boy hies to the top,
Each nouist stands, and does on hatches hop,
Glistering swords vnshethed for revenge
Black thretning frowns, fell fury felt withal,
The rumored noise and sound of armors clenge
is hushed, to battle none does trumpet call,
Scaling ladders rear none against the wall,
Now rage, now calm, now war, now pleasant peace,
Now blooddie broil, and now the battails ceace.
To Acquitaine returned noble prince,
And into England fresh valerous John,
Sir Bertram Glesquine prisoner ever since
Our fights to me: remaining once alon
In chamber with the prince, who asked anon
How he fard: and what most people said
That he so long as prisoner with him staid:
Well most gracious prince he answered,
For though prisoner sworn I do abide,
It is with knight most nobliest vertued
I know: and diverse people talk beside
Unto my praise: you doubt to let me ride:
Be God not so, the Prince replied, pay
A hundred thousand franks and go your way.
He took the word, and soon the money paid
Against my mind: yet do I not deny
The deed: but sure he should have staid
Till Dan Peter sent us safe the money
He promisd: by him impeached suer t'be,
Wanting which a fowage was desierd
To pay the soldiers for this journey hierd:
This tax displeasd our Gascoyns maruels much,
Who flat refusd at all to pay the same,
In open words at princes doings gruch
In counsel chamber at Paris him they blame,
With ticing words cold Charles his mind they flame,
He venters t'send, the prince a sommoning
At Paris court to make appeering:
Stern looking Lion having run his race,
Safe home retierd, still resting in his den,
The prickeard fox should send it is noble grace
Bidding him come, and make account as then
Of wrongs he wrought: or threaten him to pen
In bower: fierce Lion fell, courageous
Would storm, at bringer, sender, marvelous,
Tossing his head: this answer to the fox
Poor hartles wight thy father have I had,
In grasping paws giving his kindred knox
For lended life thy sier favor had,
What desperate fury vexed thee so mad,
My only name me thinks should cause thee quail,
Beware I pluck not off thy bushing tail:
For head thoult save within some peevish hole,
Near like to this the princes speaking
The same his case, with words he does control
King Charles: and says his to Parris coming
Shall Be with helmet his head enclosing:
Armd threescore thousand waiting him upon,
Letters in haste he writ to me anon.
(Int Constantine: first when this speech was had
Of tax: (I went) for much I hit disleeke,
I knew the Gascoyns would account it bad,
Being great commanders furthermore would seek
Redress: and here we lost more in a week
Then was recovered the remnant of my life,
And thus again began new cause of strife.)
His pleasure known right reddie speed I make,
Attained straight fair Angolesme in have,
Smooth sea but late more still then standing lake
So roreth, as the world it would all wast,
For Charles defide King Edward at the last,
So flaming wars were open on each side,
To Mountabon commanded I do ride:
Unto the French to hold war frontier
The Captall Beuff, sir Jews Harcourt went,
Sir Richard Pontchardon, for mars a soldier
Whose sables shield silver plats ysprent:
We issues make, of most knightly event,
Two Gascoin Lords wary bushment make,
Took a Seneshall namd sir Thomas Wake,
Armd in silver two fair bars of red,
Three rundels in the lostie chief do stand
In sable bordure deeply ingreled,
This venture hap betwixt Lusiguen and
Meribell: great error soon was fand
In so weak riding: we closer trouping kept
Toward our enemies well appointed stepped
Unto Terriers, and siege about it laid,
Raised assaults the which auailed naught,
Fearing least too long a time we staid,
Good myners got that so their buisnes wrought
The strong foundations of the walls out sought,
Spoyld was the Town and greatest numbers slain,
We heaped wealth and treasure in it gain.
Atchiued to Mountabon we retier,
Sir Eustace Dabscote new come from Nauar
Unto the prince, forth sent by his desire
Us to assist in this brave fronting war
In Ermins shield three hamets red he bare,
We him receud as fresh as Aprils flower
Fair Marquis Iuliers only paramour:
In true amors liud this knight valerous
And Ladies form in breast close shrined,
Absent thoughts vewd Lady glorious,
With Iulie thinking stout heart it pined
And mighty goodly things it shrined
For to attempt: knight of amorous trade
Loved Ladies favor has more valiant made:
Sir Robert Canole in Britton rested,
Where he large lands and heritage possessed
From thenglish his heart he never wrested,
Ever most true and loyal to us pressed
Knowing how the French themselves addressed
On us to win: with threescore men at arms
Like number archers dreadles of their harms,
Left Britton, and ariud at Rochell Town:
Where sir John Deuereux captain does remain, Counter changed to Sir Walter
Deuereux the elder house.

Whose gulie armor with fair fes was bowne
In chief three plats of silver standen plain,
He nobly does sir Robert intertaine,
Staid not long does Angolesme attain
Where of his knights th'prince maks him sovereign,
And sent him now asscotiat passing well
With stirring knights toward us forth the lance
Came to Again, from whence not far does dwell
Sir Perducas Dalbreth that ward for France,
Speaking with him, preached so by chance
As English he for ever does abide,
Commanding well three hundred by his side.
So marching they to Darmell siege do lay
Strong fortress and most able to endure,
Besides in it five warlike captains stay
Skild in defense, and wary garding suer,
The only practice chief they put in ure,
I hard of this and those which were with me
Thither to wend we shortly all agree:
But in our way to Mountsac near we came,
Strong town and kept: we thought to pass it bie
Four, vittaild summers going unto the same
We met, asking, they do not ought deny,
How stood the town, and then we backward wrie,
Take it: and leave sir Robert Mutton there,
In silver shield a cinquefoile blue does bear:
Having sped we to the siege approached,
Where sir Robert does highly us receive,
Well pondring here how little we incroched
Of these stout five: we it and them do leave.
Marched to Doume, and there assault do heave,
Strongly seated by nature and by art,
But long we staid not ear we thence depart,
We resting here Chandos my Herald goes
Unto sike prince from us of credence sent,
Declaring t'him the order of our foes
And other affairs great and importent,
Willing herein his gracious plaisment,
He gone: Gauaches, Foyns, and Rochmadore
We gaind, and make them English subjects swore:
Toward Villa frank we swingd and country spoil,
Fair towns, strong castles, by treaty or by force
We take: with flame does champion country broile,
In Thoulasine we prosecute like course,
And Villa frank was take with some remorse,
The Duke of Aniow fell angry in his mind
At us: but yet no remedy durst find.
My Herald come in quercy does us find,
Tribulation greatly we had brought
The country in: to learn the princes mind
We ready, his pleasure having sought,
Desiering all his mind should whole be wrought,
Accordingly to Angolesme we go,
Pressed to depart we let our Captains knoe,
What town, strong fortress, so from French they take
For keeping it to have at all no dout,
We strongly would such speed unto them make
That angered enemies should not get them out,
Doutles they were a brave and ventrous rout
Ortigo, Wisk, and Bernard Delasale,
Who over a wall like any cat would scale.
These three the castle of Belperch do gain,
Old Queen of France Duke Borbons mother there
Made her abode: great cause had she to plain
Such companions of her rulers were,
How so she plain hard Fortune must she bear,
Ortigo, Launt, and Bernard Wysk I ween
With sale, right happy thus to rule a Queen,
From Quercy we: from Burdell so retierd
Both earls of Cambrig and of Penbroke
It having wone as greatly they desierd,
Where sir John Mountague at the skirmige took
Two brethren Batfoyls often their host awoke, Arnaldin and Barnardine

At Angolesme arrived all by chance,
To each the prince showed lowly semblance.
Still purposing fierce foes with war to vex,
The Roch sur you a fortress mighty strong
Which enemies held, we thought to ours tanex:
John Bloudew captain was the French among,
The piece toth Duke of Aniow did belong
Thinking it against our power sure
Ablie well, one year strong to endure,
Attempting we gaind it in little space,
Madlie displeasd the fretting Duke his mind,
Poor Bloudew found with him but little grace,
For in a sack some drowned do him find,
In which the Duke some caused him to bind,
We returned, of wished purpose sped,
The castle won, and captain Bloudew ded:
Magnanimous Proteselaue that desirde
The threatening Trojans first for to invade,
Thereby unto perpetual fame aspirde,
Of lofty honor gaining highest grade,
Before the best the ventring way he made,
So oftentimes when men do most despise
Their lives fair fame ene then does highest rise:
Our Proteselaue, at Poicters that us led
Sir Ieams Audley, thrice renowned knight
Sharp sickness took, causing him keep his bed
Wherein he did, with praises ever bright,
His funeral the prince caused be dight
Most solemly, himself in person there
At Poycters where his body we Iteer:
Thus changing time about does changes wheel,
Present in office I do him succeed.
Shortly making stoutest Frenchmen feel
My being there: I ever found good speed
Which greatly made them stand of me in dreed.
Although bright sun here Poyctow seemd to lose,
Yet many deemd another to them rose.
For Seneschall of Poyctow was I made
Int' Aniow then I meant to make a rode,
Gathered knights, and men of warlike trade,
Th'erl of Penbroke at Mortain made abode,
Chandos my herald unto him he yode,
To ride with me him most humbly praying
With his command: he sent me the denaying.
At first he seemed gladly to agree,
AEmulous some about him that attend,
Affirmd the honor would remain to me
Of his journey: and farther do defend
That by himself it honor was to wend.
A bachelor I, respecting his regard
So he refusd, but yet I forward fard
Forth sending, having gathered some my friends
Sir Thomas Percie, who in sun bright banner raisd
A blew lion rampine, which difference fends
From challenging: sir Thomas Spencer plaisd
With me to ride, sir Eustace Dabscote seasd
His lance and came: sir Thomas Balester
All in good will the French stout to master,
Sir John Crinell, sir Steven Gouseton
Three roses gold in Azurd shield had pend,
Sir Neal Loring, who fairly Arms put on
Quarterly white, and red, of guls a bend:
Sir Richard Dargenton does knightly wend,
Who fair in Coral bar as we beheld,
Three silver cups bright glistering in the field:
Burned Aniow: bout Loundonoys we bide,
Right plentious, rich, and good the country was
By Crewse green banks, we Thourayn over ride
Burning, wasting, that many shrike alas,
Thence to Vicount Rochaorts land we pas,
Sir Lewis Sanxer I hard did rest us near
Who Campain banner did sans difference bear:
Toth Earl this caused me to send again,
Desierous this Marshall fresh to view,
Created for old was sir Dandrehen,
Notwithstanding th'erl all this well knew
He yet to me excuses framd of new,
I discontent for orgule that he did
Refuse: dischargd, and back to Poycters rid:
Earl John of Penbroke gatherd soldiers bold
Entering spoild, where late I left before
A manche of rubie richly set in gold
In banner ventelan en la vent he bore,
Rochaorts lands he burns very sore,
One day by noon unto Puirone he came,
The Frenchmen well advised had the same,
Well purposing to rest him there all night,
Dismounting soon as one that dreaded naught,
His people all from off their horses light,
Some herbage for themselves and them they sought,
But here they all close in a trap were cought:
Sir Lewis Sanxer, for the novelty
Of his new office, sought for dignity,
He knew the erl courageous gaie and young
More sooner for to be intrapt then I,
His folks assaild, the foemate was too strong
At entrance they our Lady Sanxer cry,
Of therls troop a hundred and twenty die
At greeting first: therle him soon adrest
Assembling fast his masd friends the nearest,
Sir Thomas Percey, sir Baldwine Freuile,
Perceiving strength and foes furiousnes
Into a house their men within a while
They drew: the French making great ioyousnes
Apperceiuing them well so succourles,
Saying they should most dearly and suerly pay
For their misdeeds before they went away:
So fierce assail, so fine defense again,
So strong attempt, and then so sure resist,
Such eger climing, such tumbling down amain,
More briefer work no soldier ever wist,
That afternoon the French their purpose mist,
Weary and toild at night they make retrait
The morrow morn determind of their fait.
Ne could they escape so hardly enclosed,
The French men thought they had them sure and fast:
Good watch they kept least any escaped,
Distressed erl strange miss adventure cast
And found himself oppressed sore at last,
For vittaile none, nor comfort ought at all,
But helpful hands, and bad thin stony wall:
At silents hour and darkest of the night,
Good squier he called in whom he trusted much:
Entreating him with swiftest speed he might
To Poycters: considering danger such,
From needful journey true squier does not gruch
From postern parting, wandered up and down
All night could find no way to Poycters town:
Till broad day, his horse then weary was
Yet traueling by nine to me he came,
Found me kneeling as custom vsd at mass,
The state of his left Lords does plainly frame
Repeating often the earl of Penbroks name,
Praieng aid: greatly I repinde
At former act so easily not inclinde:
Pawsing a space, then dinner was prepared
And I disposd to dine before I went,
About this time the fight exceeding hard,
The earl a second squier to me hent
Willing him ride ragd foes for to prevent,
From finger taking his known ring of gold
Chandos from me salute, pray him he would
Give me relief: so hardly in distress,
By storming foes: who many ladders brought
Right egerly ascending to oppress
Them toild within so virtuously they wrought,
That desperate climers dearly climing bought,
So well enduring as wonder was to see
So weak a place defended strong to be.
This knightly erl was as courageous,
As full of comfort in extremity,
As any Lord that arms battelous
Ever put on to quail his enemy:
As brave defending proved most plainly
Daring do, what to tried arms belongs
As proudest he, largest praise out throngeth.
This latter squier entering in my hall
On bended knee does forth sad message tell,
I staide, half dind, pondring said I shall
Be highly blamd, and sure I do not well,
To suffer him lost whose valor does excel,
So high allide, companion at assaies
To my good Lord of Cambrig worthy praise,
Himself great Lord extraght from noble birth:
Presently commanding each to horse
Unto my knights words full of pleasing mirth,
Most glad to see me bent to sweet remorse,
Grand gallop we hold a hastened corse,
Which news was brought unto the French by chance
Fast coming I was with two hundred lance.
All suddenly they left often to assail
Long weary earl, and fast away they fly,
These fresh gallant of hoped purpose fail,
Thinking not good my coming to abie,
Or toyled sore a battle for to try,
My drawing near our labred friends do judge
When fast they saw away their foes to trudge,
Then leaping on such horses as they had
Leau Puirone, mounting some two on one,
Some walk a foot whose chances were so bad
To lose their horse way with the Frenchmen gone,
In this estate we encounter them anon
Slo coming onward: where as great semblaunce
And show of love made at incountraunce,
Saluings done low thanks both give and take,
Gaie earl as blithe as escaped bird from snare
To Mortayn glad his reddie way does make,
Accounting me chief cause of his welfare
Says to his friends, we much beholding are
To Chandos: at great pleasure does recount
His escape, my aid, to Poycters I remount:
Each one which from adventures dangerous
Is safe escaped by good accident,
Though loss were much beseeming dolerous
Yet self escaping is woes bannisment,
The greater danger greater meriment,
Forpassed travel most pleasant telling,
Sweet is fresh air to lost prisners smelling.
Pale envy greeues, when matter wants to grieve,
At others weal pines more then own mischaunce,
Joys when disaster hap does all deprive
Some mortal wight of happy pleasaunce,
Full sadly beweeping each fair semblaunce,
Bad favorite of black infernal devil,
Gladly delighting in most wicked evil:
Cancred malice sound reasons enemy,
Vile enuies cheifest agent of her thought,
Wide blasting bellows to raging fury,
For wilful self mischief has out sought,
Where ginnings bad there endings ever naught,
As true loves flame the mind to honor boundeth,
So malice rage the senses all confounds,
As lurcking spark in hept straw enclosed,
Feeling wind quick life of cresment blowing
Stealing at first, to strong flambes disposed
His late cover, with furious bestowing
Both self and couers sooner ore throwing,
So lurking malice cares not self to burn
So that others with self she ouerturne:
No state so holly free from enuies bait,
No man so voud, but malice seeks to rain,
Prieng occasion the humor does awaite
Of better sort, glad if she can then gain
To take revenge to weakest humors strain,
Her only heaven in black revenge does rest
As sovereign good revenge she counts best.
An Abbey strong seven leags from Poycters stood,
Called Saint Saluine, a place of some defense,
Wherein there celd a Monk of envious mood,
That his superior hated: through pretense
Of buisnes some, one day he got him thence
To the roch of Poisay where did remain
Two captains French right glad of me to gain:
Caring not, what, or how, so they might have,
Knowing wicked monk to these two he came,
In close dark night to come of them does crave,
He would restore the town to them agame,
Sir Lewis saint Julian, Carlonet frame
Their wills to his, the town is so betrayed
The knight it kept and there as captain staid:
False cursed monk, true causer of my death,
What made thee gad thy civil cloister out?
Sweet contemplation vowed not thee staieth,
Monsterous fury stird thy thought no dout
Using thy work to bring my end about,
Had thou been of blessed Barnards trade
Good thoughts divine had thee more honest made:
I whom sly fortune never once did mate,
In high dispite took so foul treason don,
Wicked treason wrought my luckles fate,
The vilest plague that raineth under sun
Goodness never by thy bad working don.
Practicing thoughts had I lost place t'regaine
Forcing not how or by what subtle train:
To armed knights and squiers in my charge
Bout this reprince I secretly do send,
Bold Poytouins to me in bounties large
Of loving thoughts which freely they did lend,
Unto my requesting soon condescend,
On Newyeers eve the period of the year
They commen are to me they loved dear:
Sir Richard Dangle, sir Lewis Harcourt came,
Two golden bars that bare in field of guls,
Pons, Dargenton, Pount Chardons must I name,
Sir Thomas Percy the Rochelos that ruls,
Sir Baldwine Freuile, from me he not reculs,
A patie cross of red in gold he bare
On which five losinges varrey placed are:
When each brave knight with his bold ventring band
Arrived were, three hundred spears we found,
With judgment much our great buisnes scand,
Poycters we left, and swift away we bound,
None but we chief commanders knew the ground,
Where well I thought to bring fine feat to pas,
By wondrous hap I much deceived was:
Approached close unto saint Saluins walls
In deep diches buisie to ascending,
Our horses given to waiting boys there calls
A shirling horn, with sharp sownd eccoing,
We were discride I warely doubting
Said we have faild, and willed to remount,
What worlds devise is worthy good account.
What practices we mortal men devise,
God does dispose as likes his pleasure best,
Our wise conceats, right foolish does he prise,
Vain the soundest judgments of our breast,
His high decrees permanently do rest:
We platforms lay but sequel never see,
Example plainly does appear in me:
Rebounding horn shirl hard the worst I dout,
Casting indeed my thoughts beond the Moon
Ungracious fortune, me to my teeth does flout,
Making my deep pondrings all undone,
My long studies were confounded soon:
Mighty God my doings laughed to scorn,
Daunting my courage byth sounding of a horn:
The reasons why it sounds that proper hour
From Poysay roch, with only forty lance
Came Carlonet, to seek sir Lewis power
Ariuing here with us by luckles chance,
With joined soldiers pointed to advance
This night int Poyctow hoping there to win,
His horn does wind his friend should let him in:
Had I taken the opportunity
Fair, offered by these captains absence,
The town had I surprised speedily
And well atchiued forewished pretense,
Against decreed fate, find no defense
Wight ever could, why should I hope alone
To find the grace that erst found never none?
Of these two Frenchmen their forth outriding
We ignorant every one retier,
Unto Chauigney: there purposd I some byding
Good knights of Poyctow courteously desire
Ift pleased me t'command their service hier:
I render thanks with no: they farwels take
Some English knights with them a party make,
The latest night of all forepassed year
My valiant friends and I disceuered,
Aduenterous hearts well worthy arms to bear:
Come to my house from saddle alighted,
Sir Thomas Percy me kindly asked
If I determind here to make my stay
Till morrow morn that it were perfect day,
Why gentle knight, quoth I, do you inquier?
Replieng said, departing I request:
Him wished I remount ats own desire:
In melancholious troubled thoughts I rest
Which to remove attendants began to jest,
With iangling words and chatting meriment:
A stranger enters with fast approchment
Saying: my Lord I speedy news have brought,
I, what: he told, sir Lewis and Carnet were
Both ridden forth, and so adventures sought:
Of small account I hold the thing I hear,
Perhaps say thel' buy their ventring dear,
Our armed friends to ride that had a mind
Are strong inuffe if that they may them find.
I forth inquier, which way French captains hold:
To Poicters ward he said with speedy race:
Most careful I, lest seeking enemies should
Do some dispite sounding t'my disgrace,
Deep pondering upon that thing a space
Called to ride, but little having gone
We caught the track of Frenchmens horse anon:
Fast galloping strong brig for to attain
Under which Vingenna does swiftly slide,
Percy them spieng, strikes with spurs amain
It first to gain, being on the other side
With so quick and valiant speed he hide
There ariuing to stop fierce foe, does light
With company few like valerous knight:
A foot lights the foe, it apperceiuing
Egerly bent him stoutly to assail
Who nobly trusted to good defending,
As manly he their bouldnes could not quail,
French horses given unto their boys, ith tail
Of them came I, with floting banner spread:
Which seen they knew, and fast away they fled,
Leaving their masters horses in the place,
To whom I riding briefly began to say
With taunting words: intend you French a space
That armed raunge this country night and day,
Rich prisoners take and ransoms bear away,
Castles, towns, and other things you gain
In stealing sort, where seneschall I remain:
Asking of me no leave, at pleasure
Riding, you two so mighty masters be,
From of this soil springs all your treasure,
We now must reckon, how so we shall agree
For injuries so great you offer me,
And know this thing does please me passing well
We fit are met that I these words may tell:
More than a year and half have I desierd
Conveniently to encounter you,
Told have I been how greatly you requierd
In open plain my personage to view,
I am John Chandos advise me this is true,
Your feat of Arms from which your praise does grow
We mean to prove and lessen much I trow,
Still stood the French holding themselves all coy,
Seem not dismayed: but whilst to them I speak
A hardy Britton thinking not to toy
Unto one Dodale my servant gave a beak,
Down from his horse he tumbled all too weak,
Which busling buisnes when I had espide,
Chaffing a fresh I to the rescue hide:
I hastly turning, of my men demand
Why suffer you your fellow to be slain?
A foot, a foot, with speed I do command
feared Dodale, rescude was with little pain,
And to sharp battle each one does him strain,
Each one prepared for fending and defense,
And on all parts the battle does commence.
Forth I proceed in knightly order clad,
In weldie arms and in right fair address,
Side vesture wide of glistring white I had,
Which two large piles full goodly do impresse
Of glorious red that wrongs seek to redress,
Down to the ground does sweeping vestment flake
One pile before and one plast on my back:
In my right hand strong thretning instrument,
Prepared for to worken wrathfulnes,
Targ on my left, in which fair mark imprent
Of rightful arms true signs of noblenes,
High crest on helm gay note of woorthines,
Big chiftains head white wreath inueloped,
In proper colors featly dressed:
With kindled courage as I forward rusht
Purposing my enemies ouerthro,
My foot did slide and all proud bravery crushed,
Flundring, almost flat on earth I go,
But Jacques Marten sent at me a blo
Whilst thus I staggered, which does attain
Near to my eye and entered to my brain:
The mischief double my visor was not down,
Besides the stroke at all I did not see,
For that ith lands that long to Burdenx town
In chasing of a heart I lost my eye,
Most foolish sport great harm thou bredst to me
Five year before: the dolor that I feel
By this same stroke I to the earth do reele.
Twice wallowing ore as wounded unto death,
Striving Frenchmen would win me to their side,
But Edward Clifford my uncle, bout him laith
So mightily none durst fell blows abide,
Betwixt his legs me wounded does bestride,
Where friendship and true kindred are conbind
There never does knit true loves, band vntwind.
Unhappy wight that gave my deadly wound
Heeded by a valiant English squier,
Upon him running purposd to confound
The striker: with enraged furious ier
Striving for revenge with hot desire:
Sir John Cambo, sir Bertram Case do fare
Like men through rage, depriud of wisdom are.
Though maruels well my valiant servants fought
Against their foes and for revenge do strive,
Yet being too few their striving was for naught,
Ah how they mist their master now alive
That wonted was prooud courage to revive.
Alive alas I lay in pitious plight
With deadly wound right doleful to their sight:
Lusac brig built high is in the midst,
Where Percie Frenchmens coming does abide:
The foes and I met in the valley lowest,
Wherefore of him bad buisnes was not spide,
The foe recoyld he thought: does t'Poyicters ride,
Knowing lest of sorrowfullest mischaunce
How groueling I prostrate on ground in trance:
The French though winners angerly complain
Because of horse they thus frustrated be
Our garcons void, seeing my mischaunce amain
Theirs fled so soon as they my banner see,
The place they said by virtuous cheualrie,
Remains with us: yet we sore traueled
Laden with armor must needs be stayed
By enemies: since in country wandered
Of theirs we be six leags from any friend,
Our hurt people and many sore wounded
T'whom reasons laws wilds us to attend,
Two forth they sent: thus staying at wits end.
Three warlike captains fast toward them praunce
Having them sought with armd two hundred lance,
Sir Richard Dangle, sir Lewis Harcourt,
Sir Baldwine Freuile, with wasting banners light,
Which when the French see in so strong effort
With glistering Arms, for sought battle dight
Unto my men these words they utter right,
We you acquit from oaths and promise free,
Desiering in fair Arms good company,
You loss have had, we rather you should gain
Then yonder foes that come against us so fast,
Sad were my friends, for me their master slain,
Yet condescend unto their wills at last,
Mischievous fortune thus to and fro does cast,
These conquerors now, are prisoners to their thrall,
From one to the other thus she hurls the ball.
A goodly custom of our passed wars
That passing fair and Christian like did seem,
For ever at the end of hottest iars,
The conquests self so much we did esteem
That ransom better than spilt blood we deem,
On solemn oath we often great prisoners trust
That would redeem their gaged promise just,
For courtesy at end of battles rage
We Englishmen and French are greatly famde,
For cruel handling and slavish usage
Rough Almains and stern Spaniards greatly blamde,
Uncivil, rude, and beastly were they namde,
Undoubtedly brave knight most valerous
Unarmed is most sweet and courteous:
With baissed lance the knights approach amain,
Forth stepped the French willing them to hold,
For as taken prisoners they do all remain:
My heavy servants that same thing have told,
When coummen knights saw me lie on the mold
In wounded state, they greatly do bemone
My luckles death that here was slain alone:
Sharp brinish tears trickle from their eyes,
Some wring their hands making full pitious grief,
Some fill the ear with their resounding cries
My special servants such whose sole relief,
Stay, comfort, aid, and succor was I chief.
I heard one wail my hard and luckles chance,
And in his moan my praises high advance:
Sweet gentle knight he said fair peerles flower
Of Mars his train, good valiant champion stout,
What wicked wight to forge bad gleaue had power
Whereby bright lamp of life was stricken out?
Black colie smith when first thou wents about,
This tool to forge: I would thou had ben mad,
Dan Vulcans luck or worse mischaunce had had,
Brave England never bred a brauer knight,
Puissant France has felt no fierceser foe,
Fairer conditionde never living wight,
More courtesies no earthly man did knoe,
More finer wit, more judgment none did shoe
In his attempts: more honors none has gaind
By high exployts then those thou have attaind.
From out our bunch our Orients pearl is gone,
From treasure ours our rarest jewel lost,
From iuorie ours stolen is our whitest bon,
Reft from our wealth rich thing of greatest cost,
Of all our pillars fallen is most surest post,
Good Chandos slain I say no more but this,
Best English knights thy presence much will mis:
Companions bold adiutors of thy acts,
Captains stout whose hearts with thee did dwell,
Soldiers true the furtherers of thy facts,
For thy mischaunce their pleasures will expel
As only he they loved dearly well:
This speech I hard but could not speak again
Oppressed I so much with doleful pain:
Right pensiuely resorteth to my mind,
Lord Cleremount slain at Poycters field
Not far from hence: sir Charles of Bloys I find
My conscience near, whom I from peace withheild:
Now I as he lay tumbled by my shield,
Each captain that does slaie when he may save
Some blooddie end must ever look to have:
More praisefull virtue in a conqueror
Then mansuetie is none to be found,
More famous never any victorer
Then those whose acts do breath good gentle sound,
Loath tyrant hatefuls name upon the ground,
As thundering storm suffers smooth calm at last
Well entreating should be when battails past,
Virtuous clemency spares life from death,
When ghastly Mors attacheth with sharp dart
The only thing dashed mind in quiet sleath,
From cruelty is free to have the heart,
Sweet soul it makes most joyfully depart,
A princely thing the yeeldeds life to spare
Most manly mind in victor does declare:
On sheilds and pauish laid warely
Borne to Mortimer, plast on softened bed
My wounded head unarmed charely,
And salues applied to that which freshly bled,
In dolerous plight I lay, thus sore bested,
But in the space of fowr and twenty hours
Forth flew my soul to fair Elisian bowers,
The English they lament my sudden loss,
Some Frenchmen ioyed much at my mischaunce,
Because I woonted was with them to toss
In warlike wise to their anoyaunce,
My fortunes favors they thought abundaunce
Friends English loud, because in me they found
Bounty, valor, and virtue, to abound:
Foes French, feared from hence growed their hate:
Vile giddie fortune laugh until thou burst,
Triumph and joy that thus thou gaues a mate
To me showing hateful spite at woorst,
Who trusts thy fauns is senceles, mad and cursed,
Toling me on unto my sharp decay,
Setting my sun and closing up my day:
At prosperous things thy level do thou ame,
Proud though thou have thus foild me in the field,
No fretting time shall yet decay my name,
Thou strengthles art bright glory to ore weild,
But virtuous fame thy spite obscureth seild,
All mortal men be subject to mishap
But cheefely those that sit in fortunes lap.
I Chandos felt the force of fortunes power
How fickle she, how soon she does decay,
In greatest bravery me less then in an hour
She did confound, as here perceive you may:
At Chauigney if I had made my stay,
What I desirde had come unto my hand,
For Frenchmen had been taken and their band,
Or being come if that I had not slid,
And so receud my fatal deadly blo,
Or that my vysore closed down had bid,
Or Percy had of my adventure kno,
What do I here of ifs fond resons sho?
My dismal day my latest time was done,
My oil all spent, and hasty course out run:
My death bewaild among Lords and noble dames,
For that in me much noblenes they found,
Full many a knight my great misfortune blames
To whom my courtesy often did abound,
For my large fame about the world did sownd,
A batchelers life pursuing arms I liud,
In countries cause, that hasty death depriud:
What glorious praise deserves that worthy wight,
Whose armd body as bulwark against the foe,
Dispising life in throngs of foes does fight
For cuntries cause and sweetest sweet bestow?
Though bodies die, wide do their praises gro,
Seld well got honor sufferd is to die
But memorized lives perpetually.
I count not my past death unfortunate
Because I was in my kings quarrel slain,
But that when least I thought of fortunes mate
Alone I was brought to my final baine:
Why God so would the reasons showed I plain,
Though like offense on earth God pardons,
Great dangers is of that still lasting death:
For though vile murderer flourish as a palm
Fast planted in fair Iordans meddows flore,
And goodlike days pass forth in pleasant calm,
And bended peoples knee him does adore,
Great kingdom rules, from one toth other shore,
Yet douted is it that eternally
He is condemnd to hels perplexity:
Wherefore good captains sprung of English race,
That fair atchiue makes Lords of life or death,
To yealded foe show woonted English grace,
Before you kill do as old proverb says,
Talk, eat, drink, sleep, and often take your breath,
Ear you execute thing of importance,
Then seldom will ensue repentance:
Rare is the virtue hurt not to reharme,
Great fortitude offenses to remit,
Shining glory to strong conquering arm,
To sheath his sword, when ended fighting fit,
Which happy fames does so together knit
As wering age can never waste the same,
Pleasant music to sound mild victors name:
Armed knight true stay of commonwealth
Self governing in goodly temperaunce,
Conseruer of her cheifest states in health,
Good winner of her peaceful plesaunce,
For lawyer none could plead his ordinance,
Unless thy armed body did defend
Him and the thing whereto his speech does tend.
Departed life, the Prince my heir remaind
Unto my goods, which great esteemed were
Four hundred thousand Franks which I had gaind
In wars pursuit, of body I had no heir,
On expert knight King Edward loved dear
Sir Allain Bocquesels, who bare in shield of gold
A Lion blew that silver fret did fold,
Saint Saluiours lands sir Godfrey Harcourts
Late, he bestowd: and sir Thomas Percie
My office had: and thus coy fortune sourts,
Some now aloft and then cast down we see,
Thus gasing stages ever filled be,
He was, he is, he is up, and now he is down,
He lives, he dies, here is, here was the town.
Ah throughfare full of balefull miseries,
Hard passage couerd with sharp thretning rocks,
Vile toilsome life subject to destinies,
Mad fools on stage whom flouting fortunes mocks,
Poor silly sheep to slaughter led by flocks,
Drunk peevish men, whom safties thought confound,
Dreaming they never shall consume in ground:
As silent night brings quiet pawse at last
To painful travels of forepassed day,
So closing death does rest to labors cast,
Making of our toilfull work a stay,
Thoughts, griefs, sad cares, are bandon then away,
In pomp and glory though brave days we spend,
Yet happy none until be known his end.
FINIS.
WILLIAM WYRLEY.
CAPITAL DE BVZ. THE HONORABLE LIFE AND LANGVISHING DEATH OF SIR JOHN DE
GRALHY CAPITAL DE BVZ, one of the Knights elected by the first founder of the
Garter into that noble order, And sometime one of the principal Governors of
Guyen, Ancestor to the French King that now is.
LOVE is a thing that cannot be compeld,
Nor further wrested then his liking grows,
Not mines of wealth, nor honors glory weld,
Nor blandisment with her fair pleasing shoes:
Not gastfull death, from which great horror grows:
Not lothd imprisonment, nor love of liberty,
Nor sad conceits plungd in perplexity.
The more you strive, the more you vainly strive,
Thinking to move a constant settled mind:
Such one as seeks not after gainful thrive,
But firmly does his thoughts to honor bind,
And troubles makes him faster for to twind,
Fast gaged band of love, and scorns to live,
More rather then the same he will vnriue.
Rather then that one jot of plighted truth,
Good valiant heart, will swerue from voud behest,
It suffer will, much woe and pining ruth,
With endless griefs, and torments over pressed:
For true love dwells but in a valiant breast:
Harboreth but, in high Heroique thought:
For cowards love is fickle, light, and naught.
Record my self, a knight in Gascoine borne,
And to the house of Foix by wife allide,
German Remond, from him fame did adorn,
With Phoebus surname for his witty guide,
His honor, wealth, estate, were bruted wide,
For errant knights, such as brave Arms profess,
Right welcome these, strange knights his chiefest guess.
And under him I first began Arms to wear,
Learnd fair to ride, and tame the raging steed,
To don my helm, and couch my thretning spear,
To brandish sword, to serve his masters need,
That daring foe by these his end might reed:
To weld resisting shield, with gold bedight,
On sables cross, five silver scallops bright.
The English party strongly I maintaind,
And ever armd against the crown of France:
Much honor, praise and noblenes I gaind,
Most highly me king Edward did advance,
Decked in his knightly Garter gay I praunce,
Among first elected, is my name enrold,
And ever went my valor uncontrolled:
At Poicters field, in battelous array,
I raunged was among the hardy knights,
My shining pennon wefting I display
Amid the throngs in thickest of the fights:
On whom soever my sad axe it lights,
Is either feld, or slain, or prisoner bound,
So dealt I death, and many a doleful wound.
Sir Charles D'artoys, and many knights were taken,
By me and mine, that ransoms rich we gain,
For through the press I pressing made a lane,
Of ventring Arms delighted with the pain:
No trifling here, nor leisure was to feign,
But fight, or die, or yield with foul reproof,
Defend, assail, for honor and behoof.
The battle wone, our fury all was laid,
In such triumphant iolitie we groe,
That each one thinks him self so well apaid,
As numbers of our captives we let go
On their gagd faiths, we trust them even so,
Word, and deed, dear Christian blood is saude,
The conquest ours, the thing we only craud.
The noble mind naught but the conquest seeks:
And where the quarrels but for titles cause
Fair wars should be, not like revenging Greeks,
Whom scattered blood, and fire made to pawse:
For as our God is just in all his laws,
Plagues the murtherous, and bloodthirstie mind,
With blood, for blood, as those fell Greeks did find.
I over pass the taking of King John,
His yoongest son, and many a great estate,
The numbers slain, of Earls, and Lords, each one,
But fortune here, did young Lord Barckeley mate
Pursuing foe, with swift and speedy gate,
With courage stout: through too much courage lost,
His journey did a Barons ransom cost.
A squier he spide to void the field in have,
Well mounted brave, he after him does hie,
The French looked back, and was not much aghast,
Though fine in Arms, the Lord he dight epsy,
In field of gneuls, ten formed croslets be,
Of silver bright, a cheuron them between,
Full knightly Lord one might him easly deem.
This skillful squier, a wary man at Arms
Practisde in fight, and heedy in his deed,
The Lord venterous, dreadles of all harms,
Fast spurring coms, as he that thought to speed,
But fortune him, a little faild at need,
Right poysent bloe he stroke, and haples mist,
For the others check hit right upon his wrist.
Th'incountring stroke did force his sword to fall
Into the field: the Lord dismounted straight
As he no misaduenture could apall,
But as he stoupt, the squier by cunning slight,
Picketh his sword, and pearst his thies with weight:
John Helens light, the Lord his prisoner swore,
Drew out his sword, and from the field him bore.
Such does of wars the rare adventures fall,
Most sonst to loose when least we do mistrust.
Now was black prince so buissie t'order all
His great affairs, abstain a space he must
From Arms, but I, lest that mine Armor rust,
With cosen Foix to war in Pruce do wend,
Where Sarisines souls full fast to hell we send:
Like Christian knights on miscreants we war:
High honor gain, and home we meant return,
But now in France was fallen so foul a iar,
To hear the same each honest ear would burn,
The pesant French, did at the gentle spurn,
No Scythian, nor lothd Parthian act
So monstrous ever, both for form, and fact.
This clownish rabble by troops assembled,
Until that they six thousand were increast,
They still increast, outrageous waxed,
Never meaning, from mischief to have ceast,
But practiced, who should be likst a beast,
Of their bad horrible acts, one i will recite,
To show the substance of their vile delight:
Within his house they took a worthy knight,
And on a broch they thrust his murdered corse,
Then roasted him, in wife and childrens sight,
Now after twelve had ravished her perforse,
To eat the scorched flesh, without remorse,
Of her dear Lord they did compel: then slew
Her piteous self, that lothed life to vewe.
What cruel Atreus, might the like devise?
What bloody Progne, like torture could invent?
Nor he, nor she, nor Devil, I surmise
Might have bethought more dierfull bad event:
Or worken thing of more astonishment:
Most villainous doer of wicked thing,
Their hellish voice, make him their beastly king.
At Chalons, occasion offered stay,
In our return from Pruce, to enter France,
Of these helhounds, we heard the people say
How diverse Ladies, like were to mischaunce
In Meulx: for these dogbolt crewes advance,
Thither enragd, with spoil, and rauishment,
Sad murder, cause of woeful pale lament:
Which news forth told, the Earl and I accord,
To rescue them, or do our best deuoyre,
There once ariud: us welcoms they afford
Most glad the Ladies of their present power:
Joy makes their tears distill like silver shower:
Fair Duches of Normandy, and Orleance,
With more, three hundred, all in like mischance.
Though I were English, yet tender pity mooud
My melting heart, to favor their distress:
Twixt both the kings, peace for a space was prooud,
If not? what armed knight could have done less,
Than to comfort chaste Ladies comfortless,
Against such feends, stern bent to rude uproar,
Nine thousand thought, yea some did number more:
And to the gates of Meulx inragd they came,
Which opened were byth villains of the town,
Full were the streets, with catiues void of shame,
With chilling fear, the Ladies swapped down,
In deadly sownd, to hear each rakehell clown,
Yeall showting threts, which made our house to shiuer,
Compasd part with Marne, the gentle river.
Against their rage our gates we open wide,
Wherein there stood in glorious arms so bright,
The Earl of Foix: and goodly armd beside,
Him stands the Duke of Orleance warly dight.
Their noble banners before them both they pight,
Foix bare gold, three pales of streaming blood.
The Other France: with fair large difference good.
With thretning Axe in hand I was at hand,
And my disuelopt pennon me before,
Thus when these clowns perceiud us fearles stand
Purposely Armd their filthy corpse to gore,
As cewting Curs, trudge when the lions rore,
So hartlesse clowns, fled from our tried might,
Base clowns, base thoughts, and basely take their flight.
We slew the beas till weary conquering tools
Were foul distaind with filthy rascald blood,
This dunghill brood, these brainsicke fuming fools,
That furies rage, incensed raging wood,
Of their wild gore we make a gushing flood:
Of these base slaves, we seven thousand slew,
Fetherd with fear, the rest fast nimbly flew.
Lothing the slaughter of this rascald rout,
Cause chaffering townsmen taken had their part,
Bright flaming fire, we cast the town about,
To teach them learn more civil kind of art,
The Ladies court us, with freed willing heart,
High praises ring of this that we had wrought:
Clownish practice soon are to ending brought.
A special time for valor to be shone,
A rare adventure for heroique spirits,
Here was that boiling valor might be shone,
We ours extend and give us but our rights,
The clowns nine thousand, gatherd in our sights,
My cosen Foix and self, had threescore lance,
With them we did atchiue this happy chance.
In such a cause, for noble knight to die
And sacrifice himself for just defense
Of Ladies truth: believe it suer will I,
Of mighty God he shall have recompense,
And in some sort for other sins dispense,
Brave knight, chaste Lady, bound is to defend,
Chaste dame, brave knight, in honor to attend.
Each knight that clothes himself in burnisht steel
For Ladies truth and noble damsels right,
Least that reproach and bashful shame he feel
Must hazard life, and enter dangerous fight,
As here did we, Jove abled much our might,
These rascald peasants like to mad dogs slain,
With thanks rewards remercied was our pain.
About this time from Parris safe was fled
By cunning slight king Charles king of Nauare,
His buisnes sly so craftily he sped
Or that the busy regent were aware,
Spiteful defiance to him he does declare,
And to the mighty realm in general
The like, and then he ward unto them all.
His part I took with those of my retain,
He frankly paid and we did freshly serve,
Stoutest Frenchmen we mightily constrain
For hunger many ready were to sterue,
The earth untilled, none did the vineyard carue.
We patisd all the country to and fro,
That no man durst without our pasport go.
Thus of the fields and of the rivers Lords,
Fair castles, towns, we daily wan and took,
Until the Legate Cardnals set accords
Between the Regent, and the king, who took
His oath to be bon Francoys on a book:
Before Melune, his brother Philip was,
All malecontent from thence he soon did pas.
Int Normandy he, and I to Cleremount,
For iarring wars were thundered openly
To France, for that they held not of account,
The treatise made in England sincerely,
In Beauesine, I warred right fiercely,
Till Edward king, safe past the raging streams,
Fully resolude to place his siege to Reames.
For me he sent, I speedily obeyed,
Having wadge war to all the country round
And came in time, when as his siege he leayd,
To th'intended town, and all the prochaine ground
We rifled, and toth siege brought what we found,
The countries near, were grown so passing pore,
With thriftie hand, the creasing earth none store.
From thence the king remoud to Aguylon,
Staid there the lent: for that an English squier
Had taken Flauigni, called John Dalison,
Wherein provision was of great acquier,
With as good wine as need would well desire,
The squier was armed, all in trusty blew
A shining silver scuchion fair to view:
From thence toward Parris, with consuming waste
No costly building from our wrathfulnes,
Each thing almost, we turn unto degaste,
Proud Frenchmens joy we bring to balefulnes,
Their arbors spoil, and vineyards pittiles,
That fairest buildings, make we fowlest place,
And goodliest work, we batter, break and race:
Near to the city when the king was plast,
Commands a Herald to him speedily:
Toth regent Charles, he said depart in have,
And show him here is staid his enemy,
That much desiers him and his knights to see,
In warding arms, as noble knighthood should
Defend his country by his courage bold:
This messenger performs commanded charge,
But Charles in battle so to try ne meant:
Some noble Lords hearing this message large,
To issue out, for fight were fully bent:
But th'regent staid them dreading detriment:
For by experience had he learned late
In pitched feilds that little good he gate.
Sir Walter Mannie toth barriers went,
Conducting fresh young knights new made before,
Full of proud courage, through new advancement:
Fierce was the fraie, and many wounded sore,
In Parris were of proved knights good store.
When time he spide fair back his fighters drue,
Full soberlike rash perils to eschew:
Like aged Pylote tried in many a flawe,
High towering fleet has in charge to guide,
Leads forth by counsel, and sad sober saw,
Aduising turn of wind, and change of tide,
Sholes, sands, and rocks, that under water bide,
Performs his voyage, by his wary heed
Such at Parris proved Lord Mannies deed:
The king remooud: most surely I thought,
And counsel took with six of my accord,
That gaie young knights such as adventures sought,
Whereof in Parris numbers great there hord,
Some issue after us they would afford,
This thought of mine, did come to good effect,
The French do sallie as I did suspect:
A valiant troop that prowess tried profess
On stamping coursers properly prepared,
Careless come on, some hoping to convince,
That scatter should from out their battaild ward,
Or whom t'incounter naught at all they card,
They past, the busment, we had closely laid,
They past, we glad, and little time we staid:
Sir Aimon de Pommiers and the Lord of Courton.
Three Gascoins we, three English were the rest,
Lord Moubrey armed in desierous red,
A silver Lion ramping reddie pressed
To raise his foe: Lord Neuill forward sped,
In glistering Arms most goodly clothed,
In guelie shield he silver saltier bare,
Stout Pounchardon we six the Christains were:
Of this attempt: two hundred we command,
In ruinous house sequestered from the way,
We ambuscade, where one might well have paund
His life, no foes would there have made astay,
With bustling noise, we bustle to the fray,
Like furious tempest forth we rushen fast,
The French looked back amassed at our have:
With wonderment from whence we issue could,
Turning their reains our fury to withstand,
Strongly our points ariue with courage bold,
Each against foe direct with leueld hand,
That from their seats some tumbled to the land,
Some horse and man, reuersed over quite,
So fell enragd, so strongly some do smite:
When as we had our course with courage run,
Each drew his sword, where many a proper feat
And practice of fair Arms was bravely dun,
Sometimes it seemd, the Frenchmen had the bet,
And straight again it seemd that we did get,
Of all our coast I wan the sovereign praise,
With Lord Compreney on the French it stays.
Who nobly fought under his banner fair,
A Beucle red in silver plast between
Six martlets black: slain he that did it bear,
The Lord himself was taken on the green,
And all these troops are now disparted cleene,
The most there did, some into Parris ran,
Or else they had been taken every man:
Valiant hearts whose thoughts to honor bend
Sleep not in rest, but daily do devise
New matters and strange accidents to send,
Their praises forth in golden sounding wise:
Whilst sluggish knight, in sloth and slumber lies,
Unworthy arms, who does not use the same,
Foul wight that brings fair honors marks to shame.
What booteth it of Gentries brag to boast,
What vaileth it, old ensigns forth to show
To tell how grandsiers whon in many a coast,
When we our selves no warlike practice trow?
But rest our selves with this old idle know,
Our shields the signs of Antique moniments
We maken babish lothly instruments.
Well when we had our buisnes brought to pass,
And in good covenant all our prisoners bound,
We marched where as the king of England was,
Our welcoms do with hearty praise abound,
Prisoners us their masters courteous found,
Forth on we hold, until that peace was took
At Charters, and our Army up it broke.
Our king this Charter in October gave
At Callis on the fowr and twentieth day,
After the virgins son was come to save
All mankind lost and wandered far astray,
One thousand, three hundred, threescore I reckon may:
Now on the king, int' England I attend,
Where good entreaty much I might commend.
Yet staid not long, but into Bearne I sped
To Ortoys, where I found the Earl of Foys:
Letters I receiud and speedily red,
From Naueroys king, who gladly did reioise,
For wide it bruted was by common voice,
That John of France, was now in England ded,
And he thought long till France he harrowed.
Sends for me, as chiefetaine to attend
His wars, by guidment of my proved skill:
To his entreaty soon I condescend,
Requesting other knights unto my will,
Imbarkt, and wind so well our sails does fill,
As safe at Cherbroke we descend to shore,
Men at arms and soldiers twenty score:
Breathing life toth melancolious thought,
Of this sad king: because he late had lost
Maunt, and Meulanc, both byth treason sought
Of Bouciquall, and Glesquins british host,
To Have sweet revenge he spare would for no cost,
Right glad was I that th'youthfull Regent,
Should have some news against his corwnment:
At Eureux then I made my chief amasse,
And found I had full seven hundred spears,
Three hundred archers: five hundred there was
Of brigands: to hus most willingly appears,
Captains companions not dreading future fears,
But he that brought greats numbers to our aid,
Of armed heds, for enterprise araide
Was sir John Ionel, a valiant English knight,
And sir James Planchine with him did resort:
Against our foes we strong and freshlie dight,
For our delights consist in warlike sport:
With courage good we march forth in effort,
T'incounter foe, is plast our whole intent,
Much wishing trial of his hardiment.
To Passie ward, and to the brig of Tharch;
We drew: casting the wary Frenchmen would
The river of Seen ore pass at that same arch:
Pretended journey if they onward hold,
Transierd they were, as it was to me told,
For as we rode the twesday in Whitson week
I met a Herald (who well for me did seek)
Surnamed Faulcon: I knew him passing well,
For he toth king of England does pertain,
In haste I asked if he could forth tell
News of the French? fair I him entertain,
He answer framd, in reverent sort again:
I came my Lord from where they do abide
Expecting your approaching at this tide.
What have they past the river yea or no?
On this same side they rest (he does reply)
Near unto Passie, they do abide I tro.
What numbers and what captains to discrie
I will him, and then plainly shows he
Fifteen hundred of fighting men they were,
That Bertram Glesquine cheifest rule did bear.
Lord Aucer was, and Vicount Beumont there: Sir Balwine Danekin:

Master ofth crosbowes: Lord Chalon: and Beweu:
Tharchpriest: and sir Edward Remie were: Sir Arnole Canole: brother to sir
Robert Canole.

These French and Brittons there my self did vewe:
Of your own country some knights I also knew,
There is the Lord Dalbreth his company,
Properly armd a valiant meanie.
Sir Aymone of Pomiers: the soldich
Lord of Lestrayt: then began I angerly
To waxen red, and much in mind I wish
Revenge to those I hard so busely,
Though friends to seek me as an enemy:
For Dalbreth self I ask, and he replide
With Charles the Regent now he does abide,
Who sunday next to Reams t'be crowned is led,
And after that I studied had a space
I laid my hand upon my buissie head,
Be there (quoth I) such Gascoyne Lords in place?
Yes suer he said: I took it in disgrace,
Gascoyne thus, against Gascoyne, then I swore
By that same cap that saint Anthony wore.
My Lord (said Faulcon) a herald by does stay
From tharchpriest sent of message unto you:
That herald French let pack him hence away,
For not at all my person shall he vewe,
Tharchpriest his master is a knight untrue,
Then sir John Ionell, wild he should be brought,
But I said no, his message is for naught,
His master feign our dealing would descrie,
And for no other would he hither come,
Iangle, and prate, he would so many a lie,
That pain it were to hear him part or some,
When Faulcon thus had hard my settled dome,
He went whereas the herald French does stay,
Fair answer gave the other went his way,
For otherwise then I in choler spoke,
This modest herald smoothly me excusd
In peaceful manner he the best did make,
As one that strife and discord flat refusd,
Peace, meeknes, love, his civil heart had vsd,
For rancor, malice, pale envy, and wrong,
Unto no heralds office does belong,
Thoroughly waieng every thing at large,
Being buisnes of so great a substance,
As valiant foes as welden shield or targe
Were named, and of as good approuance,
That thus against me were come in ordnance,
To praise the foes, does honors own advance,
What sever is theuent of battles chance:
If one reproach his foe of cowardice,
And with base words him greatly does defame,
Afterward does of hoped purpose miss,
Being overthrown: much to his own shame
Has he forth told: foes honorable name
Does conquest make right great and glorious,
And abject triumphs more lesser famous.
Who can assure himself of victory,
That is but flesh and blood as others are?
Then foul is it, and too great infamy,
The baseness of the foe for to declare,
Which often hurts own self at unaware:
Mean conquest is it, base rascolds to subdue,
Unto the foe give then fair praises due.
Thus both we parties of each other hard
By both these heralds: presently I sent
To Eureux, showing the captain how I fard,
Willing him all such to fight that meant,
To send them forth to me incontinent,
Which if performd, I then do vow to fight
With these French troops attain them if I might.
Directed by this heralds wary guide,
It happened that the four and twentieth day
In pleasants month of all fair Vernas pride,
To Chocherell ward we light into the way,
Where we behold foemats proud display,
So many banners wefting in the air,
They seemed twice the number that they were.
Whose glistering marks when as I do behold,
And many knew whom faithful friends I thought,
I thought against me they never raise them would,
As great a matter percing coin has wrought,
My countrymen should no such gain have sought,
And leagmen to one king and sovereign,
But kingly rule no loving hearts does gain:
They made three battles and a reregard,
The first had Glesquine, and his Brittons bold,
The Earl of Aucer ruld the second ward,
Th'archpriest did their tertian battle hold,
The Gascoins held the rergard that I told,
Led by Pomiers, the souldish, and Curtone,
Perducas Dalbreth, my neighbors every one.
When as they busy were in marshalling,
Themselves to fight within the meddowes fair,
On Itons banks, which does near Couches spring,
Shoring a hill, we plainly do appeer
By a little wood, and to our enemies near,
Into the which our boys, and carriage went,
Lest in the fight they suffer detriment.
We egal battails against our foes ordain,
Except a reregard, and with his English crew
Sir John Ionell our first did well deraine:
The second rightly plast in order dew
I ruld my self: the third as fair to view
The Marnel held: my banner high was pight
Upon a bush appeering plain in sight,
That if our men were scattered in the fray
Thither they might as time would serve retier,
Twice twenty men, about mine ensign stay
It to defend and honor to acquier,
Thus how to win I plast my whole desire,
And vantage took ofth' hill for more avail,
Purposd to let my enemies me assail:
Which they perceiving drew to counsel all,
Many of them that day had eat no meat,
Thinking betimes to fight which I did stall,
Some thirsty were, nigh sweltred with the heat,
Some scorcht almost, and choked with their sweat,
Some presently would fight without delay,
The wiser some that thing would flat denay:
Of weighty affairs as thus they hold debate,
And counsels hard, and verdits too and fro,
The Gascoyns who perused well my state,
Taught by trial, my dealing for to kno,
Said, Lords advise, ear forward that ye go,
A better knight, found is there in no land,
Then is the Captall for to lead a band.
First do ordain some men of arms t'assaile
Those that his banner have in charge to guard,
Much heedie care in this for to prevail,
Then thirty of the best that may be spard
Mounted well, and so to take regard
For nothing else, but suerly to advise
To take the Captall prisoner for a prise,
And carry him straight from out the field amain,
For otherwise, so long as he may bide
To win the same it will be passing pain,
The Captall is a knight so nobly tried,
But of his men when his surprise is spide,
They suddenly will so discomfort be,
As ours you shall the journey present see.
Beshrew his heart that there did praise me so,
For by his counsel was I ouertane,
And for that I mine enemies wise do kno
And heedy were, to bring me to my bane,
I held the hill, which made them nothing feign,
For by no art, or policy they could
Me there assaild, unless be lost they would.
When they perceiud me plast in such a strength,
New counsel then these gallants new devise,
Each thing well waid, they all accord at length
That me t'attempt they might be thought unwise,
High mounting Phoebus blasing, hotly fries,
Some of them faint, and neither bread nor wine,
Nor no auitaile had they for to dine.
Good policy it often is to refuse,
And wary deal when foes strong numbers been,
Sir Bertram sly, our doings does peruse,
Which smally pleasing were to him I ween,
And then he said, Lords, I do suerlie deem,
If we make shoe back ore the brig t'retier,
Our foes will soon descend in great desire,
And think well fly, then round upon the plain,
We may return, in order duly pight
With wishing courage set on them amain,
Observing former constitutions right,
This counsel liked was of every knight,
They execute, which when I do epsy
Fine cunning working easly I descrie.
But sir John Ionel, hastily to me said,
Sir see you not how yonder Frenchmen flee?
Yes sure quoth I, their doings I have waid,
They think to us no good I easly see,
But tole us from the strength wherein we be,
Suddenly back unto his men he hide
And fight he would whatseuer should betide:
And boldly spoke such as my person love
Rest not behind: with battelous glaue in fist
He forward floong: but when I saw him move,
Of great presumption that deed I took and wist
The knight too far the enemies meaning mist,
I frowning said he fights not without me,
Our foes in order swiftly turned be.
This English knight right bravely dealt his blows
Amongst the Brittons with courageous stower,
With mighty force he many overthrows,
In haste I came to aid him with my power,
At first our foes do find their turning sower:
Saint George we cride, our Lady Glesquine they,
So fell and bitter began this mortal frey:
Now when the battles strong assembled were,
Th'arch priest straight departed from the field,
Willing his men his banner on to bear,
And cry his cries, as if his place he held,
Against me himself his Arms would never weld,
He promise kept, well made to me before,
For which of treasons some accusd him sore.
Sir John Ionel who first this fray began,
Paid for rashness at too high a rate,
Mad fury that confoundest every man,
Who wisdom wants thy raging to abate,
Does often too soon his error find too late,
When strength, and blood, and life, and all is lost,
Purchased too dear the wit that so much cost.
Who wars does use must naught at all be greeud
To have the worse, or conquered be in field,
For he that triumphs most of all atcheeud,
Has eftsoons lost his strong resisting shield,
Unconstant fortune is constant very sield,
Loss is no shame, nor to be less then foe,
As self esteems each man is even so,
This hardy knight sore wounded was and did,
Who had before dealt thundering strokes amain,
Lord Beumont French among the dead does bide,
Sir Baldwine Danekine here likewise slain:
They bought it dear before the place they gain:
My ventrous men strove with commended pride
Presuming victory would with them abide,
Th'instructed thirty, found me where I deal
So huge and mighty bloes, as that no plate,
No hardened steel, no quilt, nor warped meal
Could make resist, but yielded open gate
To my sharp axe, my bloes so heuie sat,
But here these thirty sease me in the fray,
And by fine force they bear me thence away.
Fast to the rescue cry my friends apace,
When they perceud me ravished in this wise,
Much broyling there, much foyning for a space,
Forth' rescue some, and some to save their prise,
But foes prevail as erst they did devise,
To Vernon then I was transport in have,
And there in saftie strong and suerly plast:
As much respect they took to win the field,
Such heedie care was had lest I were slain,
The noble mind with murder very seld
His fame and estimation will distaine,
His foe may live and ransom yield again,
To save when one may slay an enemy
Is chiefest virtue praisd in cheualrie.
From Vernon t'Parris with joy I was conueid,
Where tharchpriest of the king is foully blamde
For his depart, but all the matter weid
Although the Lords of France him much defamde,
Yet help I much t'excuse him badly namde,
The matter furthered for that he lately had,
In Burgoyne slain four hundred robbers bad:
What harm took I through much mistrustfulnes
Toward him that did my faithful friend remain,
Calling his truth in question questionles,
That fair my favor sought to entertain,
His careful message flatly I disdain,
Preiudicating his intendiment
Was for to work me some foul bad event,
Yet time discovered his fidelity,
And my outrageous rash mistrusting
Great mischief bred through wicked jealousy,
Of friendly honest thoughts: often working
The mind from truth, by bad misdeeming,
The friend suspected without giving cause,
Is breach sometime of truest trueloues lause.
Tharchpriest he sent unto me for my good,
But I refused to hear his message,
Being distempered in my choleric mood,
Which bare the rule then unto my dommage,
Reason I taste the folly of my rage,
Yet now we talked at Parris being,
And good leisure had of cold agreeing:
For by the means of Lord Dalbreth I went,
About the city where I pleased best,
The coward Charles so cruelly was bent,
Against Lord Saqueuile, with me distressed
As he cut off his noble cheifest crest:
Lord Ganuile, at that present time had did
But that his son a mean did well provide.
Who notice gave unto this king of France
That if he vsd it is father any tort,
Or that he died reprocht with sad mischaunce,
The Lord Lauall, a man of great resort
His prisoner now would use in equal sort,
By this brave deed this noble son did save
His fathers life they sought for to deprave:
Renowned act well worthy worthy son,
For parents life to hazard life and all,
Careless striving, own self to be undone
Rather then suffer so his fathers fall,
No danger strange he danger ought to call,
That son, or friend, desires to be namd,
Suffering father, friend, by death defamd,
I well have seen a master guide his bark,
When blustering winds and tumbling waves did rage,
Saving himself and friends with care and carke,
Until the swelling surges did aswage,
This skyphier have I seen through dotage,
To sand his ship in calm and quiet flood,
When neither blasts nor tides his course withstood:
More harder much in compass good to live,
When careless heed our mind has whole possessed,
And sense to dainty pleasure quite is give,
Then when we are with anguishment distressed,
In troublous times we hide our guidment best,
For hundred vice the thoughts does conquered make,
When bathing heart does floting pleasure take:
As by my self a pattern of reproof,
Who well did sail when fretting tide did thret,
From sholes and flats I wary lay aloof,
No gaping fish no hoped pray could get,
My leueld course by card and compass set,
Yet did I ground when least was wind and tide,
Strike on the cliues in danger to have did:
For whilst at Parris prisoner I remain
In banding pleasure void of warines,
The king and nobles me sweetly entertain,
So that I furthered much their buisnes,
Help to persuade a band of sikernes,
And peace betwixt the Kings Nauare and France,
So was I quite of ransom and finaunce:
The Lord Dalbreth full often for me spoke,
And greatly help the battle of Alroy,
Which was performd with many a blooddie stroke,
Which to king Charles brought little cause of joy,
Yet treaties had and fair exchanges coy,
Which all fell out to further my desire,
I was redeemd as prisoner could requier:
Subtle Charles showed me great signs of love,
Castle Denemoux with thappurtnance gave,
Willing my service for his more behoue,
His pension rich far more then I did crave,
I homage yield for these rewards I have,
Into Acquitaine to the prince I came,
Who hearing this full sharply does me blame,
And said I was too woondrous covetous,
Lands to take in France, where nothing loud,
Nor honored, and thus dispiteous
Spoke he, by reason none it could be prooud,
That I two Lords might serve, thus Iulie moud,
A squier I, resent unto the king,
Surrendering castle and each other thing:
Making abodement with the loved Prince,
Whose wisdom seeing me bashed in such sort,
And how his words so much did me convince
He all forgot, turned all to pleasant sport,
Endewd me rich for to maintain my port,
Doubtless I loud his favor so entier,
Than Croesus coin I did it more desire.
Let him that stands heed well he do not slide:
For he that in a Princes favor dwells
Must wary watch, lest blame to him betide,
And careful be when meaner senses swells,
It to surpresse, when sever it rebels,
And not to yield, to ought that may displease
His soueraines mind and breed his own disease:
Heed and temperance are the things whereby
Men must them rule that live in Princes grace.
Far out stretched, recheth his persaunt eye,
Vewing each person, time and secret place,
Much beond his rule and dreded mace:
Therefore disseuerd from thy soueraines sight,
Do as his eye upon thy act were pight.
I with my Prince and in my Country staid,
Till that Don Peter was come out of Spain.
Bastard Henry of cruelty he vpbraid,
In cruelty deposing him of rain,
The Prince resolud to place him there again,
Sending for me and many a Gascoine Lord,
That unto him our legence due afford:
Him I attend and highly was esteemd,
Amongst the noblest held I ever place,
For highly was my knightly service deemd,
As well for Mars as prudent Pallas grace,
With Lord Clisson sprung of British race,
This Spanish journey did I company hold
An expert knight in ventring arms right bold.
And when the prince this king restored had
To former height, inuest in Royal state,
Full like him self, he dealt with us but bad,
His perverseness too long were to relate,
His breach of promise wrought the great debate,
That hapt between the Gascoins and my Lord
The prince: fell cause of war and much discord:
Though many Gascoin Lords my kinsmen near
The English left and French themselves out shoe,
Yet I against them did still my banner rear,
In fronting war my time I did bestoe,
With Chandos to Mountaboune armd I go,
That soon I trust we made our foes to feel
Our Axes sharpened were with caruing steel:
Now when the French the English had defide,
And noise of strifes were bruted openly,
Sport was to see the captains them divide,
As their affections led them stirringly,
Without requests to yield them willingly,
Those that were French did English straight become,
Contrariwise there changed other some:
Yoonger brother to sir Lewis Robersart.
Lord Chanoyne Robersart he English turned,
Whose hautie service welcomed our king:
Sir Perducas Dalbreth toth French returned,
Who gulie shield about his neck did fling
Wrapped with dented bordure silver shining:
Do what one can affection will be free,
Spite of desert or highest dignity.
Bold sir Hue Caueley now in Arragon,
This thundering news of wars had plainly hard,
With all his soldiers he arriud anon
At Angolesme a party for to ward,
The prince him had in reverent regard,
And presently him noble chiftaine made
Of thousands two, and sent him to invade
The lands of Lord Dalbreth and Arminacke,
The greatest two of all our Gascoyne Lords,
Where many a tower and town he fiercely bracke,
And fire and blood unto his foes affords:
Thus all we captains growing of accords
Seek to defend, and to offend our foes,
Which likewise so themselves toward us dispose:
When Canole, Chandos, and sir Thomas Phelton,
Who did in red two ermine lions bear
Passant crowned gold: my self for one,
Go to the prince, who held us all full dear,
Such companions as behind us wear,
We promised new fortress if they gain
And then besiegd we rescue will amain:
Which of our friends did three encourage so
As they Belperch do win and there they kept:
About this time did fortune ouerthro
Lord Chandos, for whose loss great numbers wept:
The Duke of Burbon little space he slept,
For that our captains held his mother fast
Within Belperch where they perforce were plast:
Duke Burbon having purueied iollie store
Of warlike knights strong siege did bout them lay,
With battering engines he constraind them sore,
His power still increasing day by day,
To sir John Deuereux, they sent without delay
Which Seneschall of Limson was, and he
Toth former promise was a party:
This gentle knight toth prince in haste he came,
And did their case with such effect declare
In showing that to us it would be blame,
If that we should not succor them that bare
Themselves so well, good words he did not spare
For their behoof: and so it was agreed
The captains should be rescude with some speed.
Therle of Cambrige fair brother to the prince,
Therle of Penbroke pressed for deeds of arms,
Sir John Montague who Batfoyles did convince,
Sir Thomas Phelton dreadles of his harms,
Sir Robert Canole that often the Frenchmen charms,
My self: we met a noble knightly crew
As of so many eye did ever view:
At Lymoges the erls their musters took
Fifteen hundred lance our selves we found,
Three thousand others, bent on their foes to look,
And join with them though numbers do abound,
This hard the French trencht in a piece of ground
With strong enclosure like a castle wall,
That from the fight their ventring foes should stall:
But when we were in opposition plast,
Against the French: a herald soon was sent
Toth Duke, who closed lay more half aghast,
The herald told him through bold hardiment,
We there were riude with vigerous intent
With him to fight: the Duke this answer dressed,
That fight he would not so at our request.
And look how he was dard at Turnehen,
So was he now: our herald morrow morn
To him rewent: who safe himself does pen,
He said, sir Duke, even she that has you borne
Before your face shall led be to your scorn,
Way with my Lords less her you rescue will
We took her thence, cold Duke he sat him still.
Shirle trumpets sound fresh courage to inflame,
We all are raungd in battelous array
Launte, Wiske, and Sale, these ventrous three I name,
That from the castle issued at noone day
Sir John Deuereux: and sir Eustace Dabscote.
And Burbons mother brought with them away:
Two noble knightly soldiers did receive
Led her thence and asked the Duke no leave.
When Thaniou Duke his army mighty made,
And Glesquines power to his he had unite,
They forward came the Princes land tinuade,
Took Aguillon byth' thretning siege they pight,
Which made me wonder when I knew it right,
The self captain did once so well it hold
That hundred thousand men ne take it could.
On Dordon river a town is planted fair
Called Lind, a league from Bergareth no more,
Which Phelton and my self did well repair,
With vittails and artilleries fencing store,
Well puruied now with that it had before:
Sir Touius Batfoyle captain there does rest,
And promise voud to guard the town at best.
And thither does the Duke of Aniou move,
Enuirning close the town in such a wise,
The dwellers think it best for their behooue
To render it, and do their strength despise,
Thunstable commons like Protheus guise
Are so delighted in each chaffring change,
Like fleeting tides their thoughts do ever range:
The captain also was becommen French,
infest with love of glittering ticing gould
Too foul a swill a soldiers mind to drench,
That thoughts to honor ever fasten should,
And his give promise permanent to hold:
I understood how all this practice went
At Bergareth: and to be there I meant.
At this delivery: sir Thomas Phelton and
My self do ride, what time the sun was plast
Betwixt the east and west in lower land:
We came as French were reddie entering fast
At the other gate: to Batfoyle spide I have,
Traitrous Batfoyle was busy t'entertaine
My croching foes in hope of greedy gain:
In hands I shook my suer bright shaking sword
Enflamde with courage as reason did requier,
I plainly showed I came not now to bourd,
Traitor I said, take here deserved hier,
Treasons no more thou shall from hence conspier:
And as I spoke I lent him such a bloe
That soul and body does a sunder go,
A just reward for such foul treason don.
But when the French our wefting banners view
Their backs they turn and swift away they run,
Lightly clad with fear they nimbly flew,
The townsmen ginne their dealing false to rue
Lay all the fault in him that I had slain,
And so the town did English still remain.
The Duke and Glesquine went to Limoges,
Where the Dukes Berrie and Burbon siege do hold,
Which city yielded was byth tretrousnes
Of their Bishop: which matter being told
Unto the prince, he swear revenge he would
So vile despite, by his dear fathers soul,
Which oath he kept unbroke and ever whole.
From Coynoc then he marched in brave array,
Twelve hundred Lords, knights and hardy squiers,
A thousand archers, so many Brigands sway,
That all the country dread their flaming iers,
On sharp revenge do boil their hot desiers,
Sir Thomas Percie, and Lord Rosse was there,
Who did in gules three silver Bogets bear.
Meignill of the north.
Sir William Mesnile a chiff of burnisht gold
Three gemels finely set in Azurd shield:
Sir Simon Borley six bars equal told
Of black, and yellow, in his chiff he held
Of the mettaile, two pales as first is speld,
In midst a scuchion of Rubie fairly dight,
In it three bars of ermins plainly pight:
Right fierce assault the city so was taken,
Many an innocent with the nocent died,
Man, woman, child, were brought to blooddie bane,
Such woeful rigor did this town betide,
The duke of Lancaster stoutly here was tried
In single fraie, the earl of Cambrig and
The earl of Penbroke, fighting so are fand,
Which tripart combat was so nobly fought
As sick prince took pleasure it t'behould,
Causing his litter nearer to be brought,
The French resist so long as ear they could
And lasht, and stroke, with noble courage bold,
But conquered yield, and yielding favor find,
As noble arms her sacred laws assinde:
Divine mercy whose lore I ever loud,
The sovereign good that God to man affords,
Most like to God man has his likeness prooud
That treasure such within sweet heaven hords,
And you great captains and renowned Lords,
That manage arms hold mercy in your mind,
Bloods wilful spiller seld does mercy find.
I was right glad from this that so I bide
At Bergareth, the frontier to sustain:
And now through France with ventring troop did ride
Sir Robert Canole to the Frenchmens pain:
Wealth and treasure did such abundance gain,
His soldiers, but silver and gold esteemd,
Oystrige feathers or what was dainty deemd.
Not virtues self can lengthen mortal days,
Yet fame prouides that virtue should not die,
Oblivion repugnes good fame always,
True writers of brave acts does still defy,
Each wight depriud of honor shut should lie
She much desiers: all covered with the corse
Of valiant deeds she takes no remorse.
If Phrigian Poet should the praises show
Of noble Priam and his worthy sons,
Their high exploits set forth in order dew,
Although large fame of all their doings runs,
Yet but defendaunts when toth sight it cums:
Assailant conqueror, this brave English king
Triumphant victors his noble offspring.
As Priam nor his sons left naught behind
But golden praise pronounst by writers skill,
And none could now their names or doings find,
So hugely woxt the vastie world to fill,
Unless it had dropped from a heedie quill:
So Muse and Mars together must agree
The first, the last, makes live eternally.
And since our Hector stout came out of Spain
He languished, which greatly made us grieve,
For stealingly each hour increast his pain,
Against which with courage good he much did strive,
Wasting sickness quite does his strength deprive:
Now into England to return he meant
Of peyred health to seek amendment.
He sent for all his squiers, knights and Lords
That of him hold: and when we present were,
Such princely gentle language he affords
As might brave courage and allegance steare,
Full sweetly spoke he like a noble peer,
In every thing he wild us to obey
His brother Gaunt which regent here should stay.
Then shipping takes the gentlest knight alive
And most renowned for his woorthines:
Right pensive I that sickness did deprive
His health that bread the Frenchmens sikernes,
In batteled Arms they found him matchles,
For so he pinde, and inly grew his grief,
As final death did work his first relief.
He newly gone: four Britton knights advance
Themselves to take Mountpaon: and they sped
So well by practice as the matter chaunct,
The Lord thereof French turned in that sted:
Which known did make Duke John to shake his head:
Sommons he forced and vowed it to regaine
In conquering wise or die with deadly pain.
It touched him near, because it lay him near,
So on a day with kindled courage stout
From Bourdeux accompanied strongly fair
He does depart with his brave warlike rout,
Of Poyctow, Xanton, and Gascoine, there about:
Of the english Phelton, Freuile, and Rosse, there was
Sir Michael Delapole did in this journey pass,
Whose cornerd shield was laid with skillful blew,
A fesse between three Liberds heads of gold:
Sir William Bewchampe gay as bridegroom new Of Poiwike.

Armed in red right stately to behold,
A girdle plast between six martlets told:
Glistering bright like Phoebus in his pride:
Well could he just, and comely could he ride:
Now when we were this castle plast before,
And ordered had each thing in order dew
We raisd assault, but were resisted sore
A whole long day: then back our soldiers drew,
This castle was inuirond with deep stew,
So fast we filled with fagots up the mot
As to the walls with much ado we got:
And now much work and buisnes was begun,
And many a man reuerst and overthrown,
More feller stut was none under the sun,
So that this news was bruted wide and known
At saint Maquere all our striving shown,
Where John Maltrait; Siluester Buds did hold
Two hardy Brittons courageous, tried and bold:
These two could not agree, which he should part,
To sucker sieged friends: then by accords
They cuts would draw: so fortune and not art
Should choose: and chance, the longest cut affords
To Buds: whereat they laugh with pleasant words,
Forth he comes with twelve right hardy men
Got in where we his friends full close do pen:
Love of friend despises dangerous fear.
We one whole quarter of the wall down break,
Then marshalling our selves to enter there,
A lowly herald they sent in haste to speak
Unto our Duke: finding themselves too weak:
Enraged he so much in angry mind
Small was the grace that they were like to find.
But then sir Richard Dangle, sought for me
As one to mercy greatly bent he knoeth:
This noble Duke toth reasons does agree
That we pronounce: for deer he loud hus both,
So we appeased his conceived wroth,
Buds his cutting a ransom dear him cost,
And thus again the French the fortress lost.
Mountcounter castle in the marches stands
Of Aniou, and of Poictow, very strong
Four leagues from Thouars, two captains with bands
Of men it kept, offering neighbors wrong,
The piece toth Duke of Aniow did belong,
Sir Thomas Percie Poictow seneshall
To come to him does good commanders call:
Assembled soon three thousand armors bright
From cities friends does mighty engines bring,
And fiercely it assailed day and night,
Incessantly they battring engines fling:
Here were companions courage stirring
Whose hearts eirned ought should them resist,
Still toth assault they forward do persist,
Sir Walter Huet, and sir John Carswell hear,
Daui of Hulgreue, in ermins finely clad
A scuchion gules: these three them well do bear,
And cheifest praise at this assailment had,
Companions three the Frenchmen greatly drad:
By heedy force and skillful wary pain,
Won was Mountcounter, near alth'warders slain.
And to these three was this fair castle given,
Strong frontier war against the French t'maintaine,
Booties rich from them they often driven
And patised the country for their gain,
Idle to rest for busy wits is pain:
Brave captains and good soldiers at assaies
Deserve rewards as well as pleasing prays.
Fair Lady Blanch the noble Henry's heir
Duke of Lancaster and of Darbie earl,
Whose titles John of Gaunt did rightly bear,
But death his percing dart too soon did therle
Bereft her life the worlds sweet orient perle.
In widdowers state this hautie duke did bide
When he thaffairs of Gascoyne had in guide:
Don Peter king of Castile and of Spain
Slain: he left two daughters heirs behind,
Which Ladies young in great distress remain,
Lest froward bastard uncle should them find,
Sir Guiscard Dangle had this thing in mind,
Imparts to me these Ladies titles fair,
Then to the duke both we the same declare:
Persuading him to comfort their distress:
He special knights of good account forth sends,
Declaring how for their behoofulnes
It was, he so himself to them commends
And for their safety all his thoughts attends,
They come: he likes: the eldest does he wed:
Thus of a wife and kingly title sped.
Till September with us he made his stay,
Then into England purposd he to sail:
My self, Mucident, and Lespaire, the swaie
He left of Gascoyne, hoping to prevail
So with the king as that we should not fail,
Of succors when the spring time did return,
He gone: in Gascoine made I my soiorne.
The summer prochaine truly to record
Was to us sent much succors and relief,
By th'erle of Penbroke and many a noble Lord,
Which all was lost unto our heavy grief,
No worser dispite or blinder mischief
Could have befalne: the earl two days did fight
In Rochell haven in the townsmen sight,
Yet could not sir John Arden Seneshall
There at that time, persuade the paultrie maire,
With any of his the earl to help at all,
But like a broking varlet dashed with fear
Or traitrousnes, no reasons forth could steare.
In dainty ermins armed was this knight
Gold and azure in fes fair chekered right.
I hard of this and thither hide amain,
And many knights of England willing bent,
The Lords of Gascoyne with their gallant train
Of noble hearts fraught with hardiment,
We come too late: our enemies took Le vent.
Which made me storm and fret with anger sad
That they and we so hard mischaunce had had.
The Constable French assembled mighty power
With him the dukes Berrie and Burbon both,
Gay erls and Lords dressed for warlike stower,
In gaining forts his time he whole bestoth,
Besieged one made sir John Deuereux wroth,
Saint Sever namde, at Poicters he did bide
When as the siege Saint Sever does betide:
Sir Thomas Percie he earnest does desire
To further that his men may rescude be,
Who condescends to that most just requier,
So forth they come and both encounter me,
Showing the state of friends extremity,
The ground, and strength, that French foemates hield,
We purposed to seek them in the field:
So forth to friends we letters sent in haste
good numbers gain and for the rescue pace,
Our enemies receive these news at last,
Which mightily their courage does abace
No will they had t'meete us in open place,
Our friends ignorant of our present post
Yielded: and our desiers were wholly lost:
When sir John Deuereux of this yielding hard
He chaft and stamped, for his the castle was:
And thus with us our Poyctaine buisnes fard:
Thus wavering fortune too and fro does pas:
Worldly triumphs are like to flowering gras,
Whose fragrant smells and hew at suns vprise
With liked favor, vades ere night and dies.
No knight that cloths himself for wars affairs
That always can atchiue his hearts request,
All are alike to fortune, none she spares,
Her coiest darlings often she makes distressed,
Now is she sloe and then too forward pressed,
She dandles him, and then on him she frowns,
Here spades she gives, and there she deals her crowns:
Oftenest times when least we do mistrust
With some od toy are soonest ouertane,
Every hour each daring captain must
Be well resolud for to attend her wane,
Often she sports to bring us to our bane,
Yet noble minds must still despise her might,
Brave honor lives maulgree so wicked wight.
It is a world to mark the iollitie
Of seamen floting in the Liquid sea,
His careless thought of dredles ioperdy,
His buisie prattle, his so pleasant lay,
Full merry mate, like gladsome bird in may,
Fairly forward with spredded canuas flies,
Like him that would attain the hautie skies:
Of all the lives led under Phaetons wheel,
He thinks none can compare in blisfulnes
With his: such tickling joy his heart does feel,
And laughing pride at present happiness,
Right cherefully whistles to their buisnes
His company: not any helliers end,
Hawser, booling, but soon he will amend:
Scarce little chip shall lie upon the hatch,
But for the swabber hastily does call,
Clean and fine each buisnes to dispatch:
Then to his joy a fresh he gins to fall
Still thinking self the happiest man of all,
Large flag and stremers tossen with the wind,
And he himself a very King in mind.
A mass it is to note his misery
When raging tempests bustle on the flood,
And to admier the strange extremity
Of him late iocound now chaungd frantike wood,
The flapping brace strikes off his settled hood,
To leeward now the needments tumble fast
Ynuffe to make a stubborn mind aghast:
The toilesomst life under the circled sky
Does his appear, and most unhappiest,
Such grief and anguish bout his stomach be,
Plays to prayers he turns now distressed,
And his sad working seems the weariest
Of labors all: his toyled mates do tend,
But how from death they may themselves defend:
Every thing out of due order plast,
To trim up ought there is now at all no care,
With frownings dume, down are his smilings cast,
And whilst he droups tossed in this sad affair,
The forcefull flood his vessel does not spaire:
Barely crauling to next recouerd shore
In wailing does disaster hap deplore.
Like is the state of all aduenterous,
That spend their lives in welding high affairs,
Thinking themselves in times prosperous
Most fortunate: but when swiftly vnwairs
Fortune them flingeth into endless cairs,
Frowning they sit, forsaken desolate,
All male content confessing taken mate.
Recordaunce make with grief and dolefulnes,
For double sorrow is it to record
Contenting joy changd into balefulnes,
Good liking turned to bad things abhord,
Fortune has so her friends both crossed and scord:
Let no man then she seems to favor most
To highly of her lended faunings bost.
Fair Subise, is a castle seated strong
At river Charents meeting with the sea:
Which to a courteous Lady did belong
That English held and so she meant to stay.
The Lord of Pons toth castle siege does lay,
Thibauld Duepont, and well three hundred lance,
To that service their bodies do advance.
Siegd Lady sent to me desiering
My succors, which I promisd should not fail,
I thought to force the Frenchmens soon retiering
With two hundred I meant for to prevail,
And straight to be the closed Ladies bail,
I might have taken hundreds two and two,
But these to serve I judged were ynow:
Thus on my way toward Subise I proceed
With trusty soldiers well accompined,
With former fortuns I brave courage feed,
Too long from thence me thought I tarried,
Coveting to ride through couerts covered,
Come near our foes a space I do abide
To fit our arms lest harm should us betide:
We do remount and entrance make in haste,
Among our foes who now our fury feel,
We suddenly down cabbind lodgings cast,
They know we brought in hand sharp caruing steel,
We ring our cries, down do the carcass reele,
Who thought themselves most safe and suerly well
The Lord of Pons with me does prisner dwell:
Some fled apace, and some were present slain,
Some couerts seek, and some are prisoners sworn,
Some maimed are, left wallowing on the plain,
Some their armors of their backs have torn,
With which some others do themselves adorn,
Whilst some toth chase, and some toth spoil do run
A mischief hapt and we were all undone:
A Welchman came that Euan had to name,
With him he brought four hundred chosen men,
With torches and with faggots fiery flame,
For passing dark it was befaln as then,
On us he sets: this rare adventure when
I did behold, I sought for to withstand,
But in the chase wide scattred all my band.
Lo I that late a conquering sword did hold,
Am now become a squiers captiued thrall,
But late I vanquished foes with courage bold,
And see the like on me is now befall,
Such are the turns of fortuns tennise ball.
Some of my friends through darkness escape the fraie,
But with my foes as prisner safe I stay:
Who proud of their good fortune led me thence
Unto their fleet at Rochell ancred fast,
No ransom could for liberty dispense,
But I in haste to Paris city past,
Where my delivery was not wrought in have,
I was the man king Charles did much desire,
Twelve hundred franks he gave unto the squier
Me thither as his lawful prisoner brought:
This cowardly king in prison closd me close
Fearing I should have still new trobles wrought,
His badgage mind to craft was whole disposd,
His quaking heart I think was ever hosd,
Thus led I forth a melancholious life,
My body quiet and now my mind at strife:
My mind to me no kingdom was at all,
I could not find that pleasant sweet content
That diverse eld have found within a wall,
From worlds affairs through wilful banishment
In this estate found I no easement,
I liud and lackt, I lackt and would have had,
I had and lothd, such kingdoms all too bad:
Perhaps it might have chaunct some rare divine
Thus pend in contemplation to have liud,
Sequestered so with prayers himself to pine
From worlds vanities glad to be depriud,
As though he in a haven of peace ariud
Have thought of saints, and martiers iollie store,
Dropped his beads and passed sins deplore:
But I that vsd to wear for hawtie crest
Black Midas head: by side a flaming sword,
And sun bright arms upon my body dressed,
Sheeld on mine arm, wherein was fairly scord
Antique signs that praises due afford,
Between my thies my gaie stout foming steed,
In hand a lance proud courage fresh to feed:
Wished some sier that hermits life could lead,
Here to remain for me in hermitage,
Here might he all his former vows have paid
To patron after sollemest usage,
Well unto God to saine his message,
I would have spoke that water of the spring
He should have had and many another thing:
To broyle in arms, to watch, to stir, to guard,
Strong to defend, well to offend again,
Here battles join, their frontier safe to ward,
Now close to troop, then goodly to deraine,
These easements were, I thought these things no pain,
Helm, sword, and lance, fair steed, and goodly sheeld,
Whole all my thoughts these brave devises heeld:
No torment to a discontented thought,
No feller plague unto a valiant heart
That rare exploits and high adventures sought,
Then to be tide so suer he may not start.
How could it choose but daily breed my smart,
Of fair atchiuements howerly to hear,
And that my self in person was not thear:
It rumord was the earl of Salsburie,
Whose shining banner was of silver bright
In fes fair foild with guely lozings three:
Sir Brian Stapleton a ventrous knight
Who in silken white a sables lion pight,
In ramping wise and flashed fair with gold:
Sir William Luzie did here a party hold
In rubie armd, three Lucie fishes white
Seemd with croslets like to Phoebus face:
Sir Philip Courtney foundring blows could smite,
Sir William Mesnile a knight of courtly grace,
Seven ships of Spain they batter, break and race,
And unto battle well themselves addressed
And Glesquin braud before the town of breast,
Holding the time sir Robert Canole pight
Which now in haste was gone to Vuryuale,
Theritage which pertaind to him of right.
King Charles well nie excepting him had all
The Brittons hearts: now so it did befall
His castle siegd, gave hostage for a stay,
To yield it up not rescude by a day,
Sir Hue Brooe that this strong fortress heild,
That marchet made, who bare in banner red
On silver cheuron three roses of the field:
Sir Robert here arrived in that sted,
Before the rendering day expired,
A herald, French Constable sent to kno
Hostage whether they would redeem or no.
Sir Robert flatly held: not any one
In absence his, his castle so should mart:
Thanswerd messenger back is lightly gone,
Told his Lords, they make him soon depart,
And show sir Robert if he so do start
His hostages each one should hedded be.
Herald (he said) say to thy Lords from me
Three knights, one squier, in prison here I have,
If they a hundred thousand frankes would give,
And mine do die no one of these thest save.
The French of life the hostages deprive:
Which seen sir Robert a scaffold made beliue,
His prisners brought in duke of Aniou sight
Their harmles heds he caused off to smite.
The siege brake up, this execution done:
The castle with sir Robert does remain:
True hostage true prisners death have won,
Such chaffring brought good hearts their deadly pain,
But noble captains such rigor should refrain,
Lest when their friends they need in such like case
They make refusal doubting the disgrace.
Justice often from ancient custom grows,
Affection seldom looks with single eye,
Strict justice like injurious dealing shows,
Hard law to make the innocent creature die,
And yet good right appeered for to be:
God loves not right which does to rigor tend,
Neither of both their cruelty can defend.
I likewise heard how noble John of Gaunt
Ariud at Callis with puissant power,
Puissantly the Frenchmen does he daunt,
Fearful makes both town and many a tower,
Numbers my old acquaintance in that stower
As Chanoyne Robersart, sir Hue Caueley,
Sir William Bewchamp, sir Henry Percie,
Sir Walter Huet, sir Steven Gousenton,
With many more which some did to me name,
Sir Lewis Clifford, sir Richard Pontchardon,
To hear of whom to sorrow brought some game,
I hopt and wished the French that they might tame,
But in their cheuachey a venture did befall
That was at Parris talked with joy of all:
Fowrscore horse of sir Hue Caueleys band
Were ridden forth adventures for to try:
The Lord of Busiers does it understand,
The Lord of Chin, sir John Buell, these three
With sixscore lance against them ridden be:
Lord Chin was slain through his great hardines,
Which to his friends was cause of heaviness:
Thus when they were assembled in such sort
Right felonous and cruel was the fray,
And many a deed was don of good report,
Chin his banner disueloped that day,
Which seen the English orgulous words did say
Against Lord Cowcie, which English houerd still,
Who was in Austrige warring at his will:
This Chin did raise Lord Cowcies fair device,
Which was six bars of varrey and of red:
This was the same, or difference small so nice
and slender, that among them this error bred,
Which now were either taken, slain, or fled:
All men of yoonger house that banners bear
Should have their difference glistring, large and fair.
I likewise heard the flower of all our pride
The valiant Prince of Wales departed life,
No earthly thing so good may always bide,
Nor honor such prevailing over strife
Where glories most mischaunce is ever rife:
Great things great falls, and far abroad are blown,
Low things low falls, their fallings are not known:
His falling known, was fall of all my joy,
His death depriuer of my comfort chief,
His loss the loder of my sad annoy,
His want the wanting of my freed relief,
Ah filching death thou felonous bloody thief,
Bereauer of my sole deliverance,
Dispoiler of my worldly pleasaunce:
For could it be that any marshallist
Such one as loud to cloth himself in Arms,
But honorable presence thine he mist,
And many ways thy loss did work his harms,
And froward mischiefs backward on him swarms?
Farewell fairst flower of Plantagenets line,
Adieu all comfort to this life of mine.
Full many treaties had the English now
Made with the French, which came to small effect:
Some of my friends oftimes did tell me how
In these their parleys they had of me respect,
Yet did no good: which made me to suspect,
That never I my weldie Arms should don
For grief whereof I pine away with moan.
The young Earl Saint Pole, and three other knights,
In exchange they offered for me alon,
Which Lord Comigines taken had in fair fights
Bith subtle train of sir John Harleston,
By his coursers bounty sir Hue Chatelon
Was saud, or else he had full dearly paid,
Because from England he was late mistraid.
The matter thus: after we came from Spain,
And that the quarrels fresh began to renew,
All things to strife and battle woxt again,
The French at first the county of Ponthew
Regaine: this Lord of Chatelon named Hue,
Unawares he does sir Nicholas Loudine rest
His prisner: and by slight he him surprest.
When as the valiant duke of Lancaster
At Callis riud new come from Turnehen,
Intending the Frenchmen proud to master,
He fast prepared to make a rode again
With store of squiers, knights, and noblemen,
Trauasing France up and down at pleasure
In burning, spoiling and gaining treasure:
If oppression to mind valiant
Be offered: by wisdoms wary guide
It so couerneth, through much discontent
As if ever happy chance betide,
It shoes the fire close covered it does hide,
And breaks forth into revenging flame
If ever good occasion move the same:
Deep rooted malice does not lightly die.
When as the duke passed by Abuile
To Louaines mind repard the injury
That Chatelon had done to him erewhile,
Sir Nicholas laid a bushment by a wile
Near to the town, for all the streights he knew
Whole three years space he used them to vewe:
Sir Hue Chattelon at that instant bode
Within the town as gardant of the same:
Near unto it he knew the English rode,
Then of the crossebowes he bare the masters name,
Them to advise he thought was for his fame,
Only ten and armed save his head
He came where as the tending bushment stead:
When valiant Louaine saw his shield of guels
Three varey pales on chiffe of loved gold
A martlet black: himself he scarcely ruels
For joy: the man (quoth he) I most desire would
In all the world, I coming do behold,
The ransom dear to him this year I paid
Shall rendered be if that he may be staid:
And forth he breaks, the Frenchmen in that sted
Do marvel much from whence does noise proceed:
One cried Chatelon yield or thou art ded.
To whom said he? to Louaine now with speed.
Replied sir Nicholas ioying at his deed:
Being knightly armd in red fresh to behold
A silver fes tween many billets gold.
And to the host in iolitie retiers
Proud of his prisner: afterward conueid
To England: where great ransom he desiers.
When Chatelon his mischaunce had weid
Back in a ship in stealing wise he streid:
This same the cause why he so swift did pas
From friends when meddling with Gomigines was.
King Edward his death I heard reported,
Who gloriously in knightly dignity
Had raind: first noble son departed,
Which Hector like with great triumphancie
Had conquered kings through magnanimity:
Then followed father worthy such a son
A shining sun which still bright glory won.
Edward the 3. first founder of the noble order of the Garter.
The founder of our high fraternity:
The fortress of a firm concordance:
The favor of right noble soueraintie:
The perfect pledge of true assurance:
The constant gage of goodly ordenance:
The founder of the Azurd garter did
With honor: Jove, so, long let the order bide.
The strong incursions sir Hue Caueley made
Then Callis captain were unto me told:
How sir John Harleston does fierce invade
Captain of Guins: some did to me unfold,
And how at Arde Gomigines did hold,
Exploiting well: of brave attempts I hard,
But oh my self from fair atchiuements bard.
My closure I with great impatience took,
Perplexed thoughts oppress me every hour,
This vile restraint I heavily do brook
And bitter sighs continual forth I power,
Right safely shut within this warding tower
Still in danger every day of death,
Least melancholious grief would stop my breath:
If thousand merchants venture into Ind,
Seeking foreign stroud for wished gain,
And only one his ship has left behind
Through wrack, which peevish fortune did constrain:
How could it choose but inly breed his pain,
To see the rest in such a reioicing,
For that he hopt: now greeues at the loosing?
For fellows many in distressednes
Is to the greeuance much releasment:
Far less by ods he thinks his wretchedness
That sees with his the tears of many spent,
To saddest woes it is much easement,
When others with like grief as ours do moan,
And that we are not wracked all alone.
All other captains, my self excepting,
Of each calling had their delivery,
Though sometimes they staid th'expecting,
Being not wrought to wish most speedily,
Yet ear the end it chanced still to be:
It was my fortune and not deserving
That thus I lay in prison staruing.
Past hope I make a virtue of my need,
With pining patience I my grief support,
Desiered death comes on with wished speed,
I drooping pass as one stroke alemort,
This hard restraint was unto me more tort
Than sharpest death that tirant might devise,
My swelling mind could half so sore agrise:
Thus long I liud, I thought it was too long:
All hopeles of relinquishing my care,
Or relaxment from loath prison strong,
Unless on book I would full solemn swear
Against the crown of France no Arms to bear.
I flat refusd me lever were to die
Than to abjure my English loyalty.
Here prooud I plain that force no hearts could win,
Here tried I true that proffers naught prevail,
Here was it seen love forced not of a pin
Sweet liberty, the mind her greats assail.
No luerments wrought my constant mind to fail,
No, no, my Gascoine body bare an English heart
Not mooueable by fortunes overthwart.
And in my smart it often did strain a smile
To think how Charles my liberty did dreed,
He doubted least I would within a while
Some broiling wars and battles newly breed,
For quaking fear his heart did ever feed:
How much the English excelled in the war,
So much the French in treaties past them far.
For by the Parley still they somewhat got.
I leading forth my life all malecontent
In smoking sighs, which out I daily shot,
But for my soul I thought it pertinent,
Which given was and must be permanent,
Most quiet and sweet harmony to make
Of discords all and all the world forsake.
Fore passed life I over canuassing,
Found my great sins exceeding numberous,
Subjected to frail natures trauasing
Ore whelmd unless by mercy wondrous,
We saved were in world so comberous,
By sweetly Lord, that straied sinners sought,
And perished souls through blessed torment bought.
And he, diverse ways deuinely works
To bring us in the compass of his fold,
Out of the which what worldling dies
Perishes as sage deuines have told,
He grant us all our selves therein to hold,
Which made himself a subject for our sin,
Yet Lord of heaven, earth and all therein.
Oh how good God us often suffers
With worldly wit our selves to injury,
Chaffring as occasion offers
Respecting not the end, till suddenly
Repentance comes our friendly enemy,
And then we cry if this had not been don
Then had not fates so foul against us run:
If I had not persuaded John of Gaunt
For to make choice to Spanish marriage,
Which thing our buisnes French did greatly daunt,
For he tended as is common usage
To own advancement and advantage,
I had not lean, he me would have redeemd
How difficult so ear the matter seemd.
And from first time I welded glorious arms
Full careful I, least murder should attaint
My fame with bad, and black reproachful charms,
Of hellish rumors, to ages to depaint:
Through murder many captains are distaint.
This proverb vsd among some I highly hate,
(A hedlesse man does seldom breed debate.)
But often times for cruel murder don
God stirs up our friends unto our harm:
And father has been slaughtered by his son:
And brother slain with brothers blouddy arm:
Often for one murder thousand men will swarm,
Whom greatest God does use as instruments
For sharp revenge of murderers torments.
Most happy knight that uses temperance
So in past life, that he be not defilde
With murderers name, which works anoyance
Through world of ages badly be reuilde
And lasting heaps of slander has up pilde.
In quarrels just whilst foes resisting bin
To slay them then in fighting is no sin.
No man of life I ever did deprave
In my cold blood when striving fight was don,
In hottest wars I willed blood to save
Whereby among my foes great praise I won,
The cheefst thing God hates under sun
Is murder, and for mercy blood to spill,
Blood cries for blood the proverb runs still.
Revenge on hateful murder does attend,
And sly occasion does so warely watch,
As blood for blood with earth does foully blend,
Merciles plagues this black revenge does hatch
When parties self of plagues tastes but a smatch,
To generations three or four they run
Till all the brood and offspring be vndun.
Oh heavenly God that long did lend me space
My former faults committed to deplore:
Five years I did in lothed prison pace
Which my proud nature did too much abhore,
That so I tamed was I thee addore.
I mercy loud, and thou did mercy lend,
Sweet mercy far more then man may offend.
Receive my soul Lord to thy governance,
Most richly since from hell thou it redeemd
I flat renounce all worldly pleasance,
Yea those vain ioies that I so high esteemd,
How loathsome now that erst so likefull seemd,
Lord since I come thy promise is not old,
Receive me where the ioies may not be told.
LENVOY
Thus closed was his burning lamp of life
That glorious shone in knightly dignity,
Here was the period set of all his strife,
Conclusion of his fatal destiny,
Lantern sometime of noble cheualrie,
Dreaded champion whilst the fraie did last,
Lovely conqueror at thend of battails blast.
In prison did this most valiant knight,
Renoumd and dred for magnanimity,
His funeral king Charles causd be dight
At Parris in estate most solemnly,
Of barrons, knights, and praieng clergy:
A nobler one could scarcely there be found
Within the French or in the English ground.
The king of England lost a trusty heart,
The king of France a stout courageous fo,
The warlike country Gascoine cheifest part,
When thou brave knight wast reft her bowels fro,
Thy glistering fame about the world shall glo
As bright as star set in fair welkings face:
The starrie sky thy fittest dwelling place:
For virtue good transcends the decked sky
Enstalde in throne beond each twinkling star,
No time, day, night, obscures her glorious eye,
Each vading substance so she passes far
Among cheifest knights extold for noble war,
Thou houldst thy seat within sweet heavens rest
In paradise prepared for the blessed.
Almighty God, that often have England blessed
With glorious triumphs over enemy,
In thy puissance victory does rest
And not in man's weak plotting policy,
Give to our Captains in their true cheualrie
Like constant virtue, truth, and courage bold
That Chandos, and the Captall true did hold.
FINIS.
WILLIAM WYRLEY.
