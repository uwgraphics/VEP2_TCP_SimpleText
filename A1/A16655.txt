Coat of arms of Sir John Scudamore, Knight
To the right vvorthily honored and most free Respecter of all virtue, his
chiefly esteemde and singular good patron Sir John Scudamore Knight.
HOw noble, how ancient, and how effectual the Art of Music is, many
excellent discourses of Theoristes deeply learned in the science have already
so confirmed and illustrated, that it might seem as much arrogancy in me to
attempt the praise thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seek
to exclude it out of divine, or human society. I will only allege one
testimony out of an Epistle, which that ancient Father Martin Luther did
write to Senfelius the Musician, which is so ample in commendation of this art,
that it were superfluous to add any other. Music, says he, to Devils we
know is hateful and intolerable, and I plainly think neither am I ashamed to
auerr it, that next to Theology, there is no Art comparable with Music: for
it alone next to Theology does effect that, which otherwise only Theology
can perform, that is, a quiet and a cheerful mind. Now if Music merits
so high a place, as this holy man has given it, can we deny love and honor
to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to
whom shall we that labor in this quality, better recommend our works, then
to our patrones and benefactors? Receive therefore (most honored Knight and my
worthiest Patron) the fruits of your bounties and the effects of those quiet
days, which by your goodness I have enjoyed. And as the glory of a new finished
house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that
owes it, so if any part of this new work of mine can excite commendation, the
grace is chiefly yours, though the labor mine. But because there is no man
more distrustful of his own endeavors then I am my self, by the weakness of
my nature: I beseech you receive my labors howsoever into your protection,
whose worth can best countenance the^ from misfortune, and spirit defend them,
I will only assist you with a poor man's bounty, I mean my many humble
prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to bless you with long life
and prosperity to his glory and our comforts, that must ever owe you our
service and love.

Your Wor. wholly devoted Richard Alison.

Coat of arms of Sir John Scudamore, Knight
To the right vvorthily honored and most free Respecter of all virtue, his
chiefly esteemde and singular good patron Sir John Scudamore Knight.
HOw noble, how ancient, and how effectual the Art of Music is, many
excellent discourses of Theoristes deeply learned in the science have already
so confirmed and illustrated, that it might seem as much arrogancy in me to
attempt the praise thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seek
to exclude it out of divine, or human society. I will only allege one
testimony out of an Epistle, which that ancient Father Martin Luther did
write to Senfelius the Musician, which is so ample in commendation of this art,
that it were superfluous to add any other. Music, says he, to Devils we
know is hateful and intolerable, and I plainly think neither am I ashamed to
auerr it, that next to Theology, there is no Art comparable with Music: for
it alone next to Theology does effect that, which otherwise only Theology
can perform, that is, a quiet and a cheerful mind. Now if Music merits
so high a place, as this holy man has given it, can we deny love and honor
to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to
whom shall we that labor in this quality, better recommend our works, then
to our patrones and benefactors? Receive therefore (most honored Knight and my
worthiest Patron) the fruits of your bounties and the effects of those quiet
days, which by your goodness I have enjoyed. And as the glory of a new finished
house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that
owes it, so if any part of this new work of mine can excite commendation, the
grace is chiefly yours, though the labor mine. But because there is no man
more distrustful of his own endeavors then I am my self, by the weakness of
my nature: I beseech you receive my labors howsoever into your protection,
whose worth can best countenance the^ from misfortune, and spirit defend them,
I will only assist you with a poor man's bounty, I mean my many humble
prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to bless you with long life
and prosperity to his glory and our comforts, that must ever owe you our
service and love.

Coat of arms of Sir John Scudamore, Knight
To the right vvorthily honored and most free Respecter of all virtue, his
chiefly esteemde and singular good patron Sir John Scudamore Knight.
HOw noble, how ancient, and how effectual the Art of Music is, many
excellent discourses of Theoristes deeply learned in the science have already
so confirmed and illustrated, that it might seem as much arrogancy in me to
attempt the praise thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seek
to exclude it out of divine, or human society. I will only allege one
testimony out of an Epistle, which that ancient Father Martin Luther did
write to Senfelius the Musician, which is so ample in commendation of this art,
that it were superfluous to add any other. Music, says he, to Devils we
know is hateful and intolerable, and I plainly think neither am I ashamed to
auerr it, that next to Theology, there is no Art comparable with Music: for
it alone next to Theology does effect that, which otherwise only Theology
can perform, that is, a quiet and a cheerful mind. Now if Music merits
so high a place, as this holy man has given it, can we deny love and honor
to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to
whom shall we that labor in this quality, better recommend our works, then
to our patrones and benefactors? Receive therefore (most honored Knight and my
worthiest Patron) the fruits of your bounties and the effects of those quiet
days, which by your goodness I have enjoyed. And as the glory of a new finished
house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that
owes it, so if any part of this new work of mine can excite commendation, the
grace is chiefly yours, though the labor mine. But because there is no man
more distrustful of his own endeavors then I am my self, by the weakness of
my nature: I beseech you receive my labors howsoever into your protection,
whose worth can best countenance the^ from misfortune, and spirit defend them,
I will only assist you with a poor man's bounty, I mean my many humble
prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to bless you with long life
and prosperity to his glory and our comforts, that must ever owe you our
service and love.

Your Wor. wholly devoted Richard Alison.
