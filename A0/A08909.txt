A peerless Paragon, OR* Few so chaste, so beauteous or so fair,
for with my love I think none can compare.

To the tune of the mother beguild the daughter.


IN times of yore, sure men did doat,
and beauty never knew:
Else women were not of that note,
as daily come to view.
For read of all the faces then
that did most brightly shine,
Be judged by all true judging men,
they were not like to mine.
King Pryam loved Hecuba,
and thought her wondrous fair,
But had he seen mine, I dare say
there had been no compare.
Stout Hector held Andromicha
a stately beauteous Queen,
But shes, no Troylus Cressida,
yet fair as ere was seen.
Nay all the faces Jupiter
did like and fancy most,
Are to her substance shadows mere
of whom I make my boast:
Surely you wonder what she is,
whose beauty I proclaim,
I Will tell you truly, and not miss
though she be without name.


My love she is the Non-pareil
of all that ere was seen,
And had not Venus come in the way
she had been beauties Queen:
Her comely feature, lovely looks,
I will describe at large,
God Cupid puts her in his books,
and of this Iem takes charge.
The Grecian Helen was a Moore,
compared with my dear Saint,
The fair faced Hyren's beauty poor,
and yet she does not paynt,
Andromeda whom Perseus loved,
was blacker then the night,
Her lineaments so well approved
in praise of them i will write.
Queen Vesta for her chastity
with her may not compare,
Nor Lucrece for her honesty,
she is like the Phoenix rare:
A Summers day, I could commend
her parts were it nere so long,
But yet her parts so far extend,
I fear to do her wrong.
The second part, To the same tune.


BUt yet my tongue cannot refrain
to set her praises forth;
Then list, and i will describe her plain
and show you her true worth:
Her hair not like the golden wire
but black as any Crow;
Her beetle brows, all men admire,
her forehead wondrous low.
Her squinting, staring, goggle eyes
poor children do affright,
Her nose is of the Sarazens size,
oh she is a matchless wight.
Her ears so hound like, that they fall
upon her shoulder bone,
I know not truly how to call
her, she is such a worthy one.
Her oven mouth, wide open stands,
her teeth like rotten pease;
Her blabber lips my heart commands,
her neck all bit with fleas:
Her tawnie duggs like two great hills,
hang Sow-like to her wast,
Her body's round as a wind mill,
and yet I hold her chaste.
Her belly tun-like to behold,
no more shall be expressed,
But if the truth were plainly told,
I Am sure they are the best:
Her brawnie blind cheeks plump and round
as any Horse of war,

Her speckled thighs they are not sound
her knees like hoggs heads are.
Her legs are like the Elephants,
the calfe and small all one,
Her ancles they together meet,
and still knock bone to bone;
Her pretty foot not above th'eighteenes
so splaid as never was,
An excellent usher for a man
that walks the dewy grass.
Her shoulders are so Camel-like,
she would make an excellent Porter,
I vow I never knew her like.
if any man consort her.
No shoulder of mutton like her hand
for thicknes, breadth, and fat,
With a scuruy mange upon her wrest,
oh Jove how I love that.
Thus have you heard my Love set forth
and yet no flattery used,
Your judgment, is she not of worth,
let her not be abused,
If any to her have a mind,
he wrongs me many ways;
For as she is beauteous, so she is kind,
and here conclude my praise.
FINIS.
