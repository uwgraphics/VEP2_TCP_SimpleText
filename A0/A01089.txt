To the Reader.
READER,
HEre is presented to thy view a short and plain Treatise; it was written for
mine own use, it may become thine if thou like it; The subject indeed is old;
but the manner of the Work is all new. If any be delighted with recreation of
this nature, and yet have not much time to spend, they are here fitted, the
instrument will dispatch presently. If they fear to lose themselves in a
wilderness of lines, or to outrunne the limits of a Plain, by infinite
excursions (two inconveniences unto which the common ways are subject) they
are here acquitted of both, having nothing to draw but the Dial it self,
contracted within a limited equicrurall triangle. If want of skill in the
Mathematics should deter any from this subject, let them know that here is
little or none at all required, but what the most ignorant may attain. If
others shall think the Canons more exact; so do I, but not so easy to be
understood, not so ready for use, not so speedy in performance, nor so well
fitting all sorts of men: and withal an instrument in part must be used, this
will do all, and is accurate enough. If it must needs be disliked, let a
better be showed and I will dislike it too; It is new, plain, brief, exact,
of quick dispatch. Accept it, and use it, till I present thee with some other
thing, which will be shortly.

Imprimatur.

THE DESCRIPTION OF THE QVADRANT, and the manner how the lines are inscribed
and divided.
CHAP. I.
1. The description of the fore-side.
THe limb is divided into 90 degrees, and subdivided into as many parts as
quantity will give leave. The manner of division, and distinction of the
subdivided parts is such as is usual in all other Quadrants.

To describe the other Work in the superficies; Take from the upper edge of
the limb about 3 degrees, and set off that space from the center R to A.

Then divide AE into seven parts, whereof let EB contain two. Or in greater
instruments, if AE be 1000. let EB contain 285. Make SC equal to EB, and
draw the line BC. From C, draw CD parallel, and of equal length to AB. Upon
AB and CD, and BE also (as far as it is capable) insert the 90 sines, from B
toward A and E, and from C toward D, but let them be numbered from A unto B to
90, and so to E 113 degrees 30 minutes, from D to C unto 90 degrees.

Again: Draw ES cutting CD at F; so shall BCFEB contain a parallelogram,
whose opposite sides, being parallel, are divided alike, and in this manner. BE
and CF as whole sines, do contain the 90 sines, or as many of them as can
distinctly be put in: and from the divisions are drawn parallel lines, having
every tenth, or fifth, distinguished from the rest. These serve for the 12
Signs and their degrees, and therefore you see upon every 30th degree, the
characters of the 12 Signs inserted, in such manner as the figure shows. And
these lines may be called, The Parallels of the Suns place.

In like manner, The lines BC, OF, being first bisected at X and Z, shall make
4 lines of equal length. These 4 lines XB, XC, ZE, and ZF, are each of them
divided as a scale of Sines, beginning at X and Z, and from each others like
parts are parallel lines protracted, having every tenth and fifth distinguished
from the rest. They are numbered; upon BC, from B to X 90, to C 180; upon FE,
from F to Z 90, to E 180. These lines are called, The lines of the Suns
Azimuth.

This done; Upon the center R describe the two quadrants VT, and BC, let their
distance VC be one sixth part of Rc, or more if you will.

Divide them each into 6 equal parts, at e, o, y, n, s; and a, i, u, m, r,
drawing slope-lines from each others parts, as Va, ei, on, ym, nr, sb: and
these lines so drawn are to be accounted as Hours. Then dividing each space
into two equal parts, draw other slope-lines standing for half hours, which
may be distinguished from the other, as they are in the figure.

Then from the points V and T draw the right line VT.

Lastly, Having a decimall scale equal to TR, you must divide the same TR into
such parts as this Table here following allows, the numbers beginning at T,
and rising upto 90 at R.

Upon your instrument (for memory and directions sake) near to the line AB,
write, The sum of the latitude and Suns altitude in Summer; The difference
in Winter.

Over VT, write, The line of Hours.

Near to CD write, The sum of the latitude and Suns altitude in Winter;
The difference in Summer.

By TR, write, The line of latitudes for the delineation of Dialls.

2. The description of the backe-side.
Upon the backe-side is a circle only described, of as large extent as the
Quadrant will give leave, noted with ABCD, divided into two equal parts by the
Diameter AC.

The semicircle ABC is divided into 90 equal parts or degrees, every fifth and
tenth being distinguished from the rest by the longer line; They are numbered by
10, 20, 30, etc. unto 90. The same parts are also projected upon the diameter
AC, by a ruler applied to them from the point D. These are numbered also from A
to C by 10, 20, etc. unto 90.

The other semicircle ADC, is first divided into two Quadrants at D. And then
upon these two quadrants are inscribed 90 such parts as this Table ensuing does
allow. The inscription is made by help of a Quadrant of a circle equal to AD
or CD, being divided into 45 equal degrees, out of which you may take such
parts as the Table gives, and so prick them down, as the figure shows.
Every fifth and tenth of these parts is distinguished from the rest by a longer
line; they are numbered from A and C, by 10, 20, etc. unto 90 ending in D.

Thus have you both sides decribed. Besides all this, there are two sights
added, with a thread and plummet like as in other instruments. The thread has
a moovable bead upon it for special use. The same thread passes through the
center R. quite behind the Quadrant, and is hung upon a pin at the bottom of
the Quadrant, noted with W. The reason of the threeds length will be seen when
we come to the uses of the instrument.

CHAP. II.
The use of the Quadrant in general.
FIrst upon the fore-side. The limb serves especially for observation of all
necessary angles.

The lines AE, CD, with the Parallelogram BCEF, are to find out the Suns
Azimuth in any latitude whatsoever.

The slope-lines within the arkes VT, cb, by help of the thread and bead, do
serve artificially to divide the line of Hours TV, into its requisite parts;
which together with TR the line of latitudes, do serve to protract all plain
Dialls howsoever situated.

Secondly upon the backside. Note that ABC is called the Semicircle: AC is
called the Diameter: AD the Upper quadrant: CD the Nether quadrant.

The uses of these are to find out the necessary arkes and angles, either for
preparation to the Dialls description, or serving after for the Dialls
situation upon the Plain.

In all these uses the thread bearing part, and therefore having asufficient
extent of length, that being loosed it may with facility reach over either side
of the Quadrant.

CHAP. III.
To find the Azimuth of the Sun in any Latitude whatsoever.
BEfore you can make any draught of your Dial, you must know the situation of
your plain, both for declination and inclination. The best way to come to the
plains declination is by help of the Suns Azimuth.

By having the Latitude of the place; The place of the Sun in the Eclipticke,
and the altitude of the Sun above the Horizon, you may find out the Azimuth
thereof in this manner.

Add the Suns altitude, and your latitude together, and substract the lesser
of them from the greater; So shall you have the sum of them, and the
Difference of them. With this sum and difference, come to your Quadrant, and
according to the time of the year (as the lines will direct you) Count the
said Sum and Difference respectively, and applying the thread unto them, find
out the Suns place in the Parallels serving thereto, and where the thread
cuts this Parallel, observe the Azimuth there intersecting, for that is the
Azimuth from the South, if you number it from the line whereon the sum was
numbered.

Example 1. In the North latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. in the Summertime the
Sun entering into 8, and the altitude being observed 30 gr: 45 min. I add the
latitude 52 gr. 30 min. and the Suns altitude 30 gr. 45 min So I find the
sum of them 83 gr. 15 min. and substracting the lesser of them from the
greater, I find the difference of them 21 gr. 45 min. The sum I number in the
line AE, and the difference in DC (because it is in Summer) and to the terms I
apply the thread, and where it crosses the parallel of the beginning of 8,
there I meet with 66 gr. 43 min. which is the Azimuth from the South, being
reckoned from the line AE whereon the Sum was counted.

Example 2. The latitude and Suns place being the same if the altitude had
been 9 gr. 15 min. The sum of the latitude and altitude would be 61 gr. 45
min. The difference 43 gr. 15 min. and so the thread applied to these terms
would have showed 96 gr. 52 min. for the Azimuth from the South.

A third Example. In the same Latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. in the Wintertime,
the Sun entering the tenth degree of, and the altitude being 9 gr. 30 min. I
would know the Azimuth of the Sun from the South. I add the Altitude 9 gr. 30
min. to the Latitude 52 gr. 30 min. and so find the sum of them 62 gr. 0 min.
And substracting the Altitude out of the Latitude, I find the Difference of
them 43 gr. 0 min. The sum (because it is in Winter) I count upon the line DC
in the Quadrant, and the Difference upon AE. So the thread applied to these
terms cutteth the tenth of, at 49 gr. 50 min. which is the Azimuth numbered
from DC the South.

The Amplitude.
Note here by the way, That the thread applied to the Latitude of your place
numbered upon both lines AE, DC, will show you, for any place of the Sun, the
due Amplitude of his Rising or Setting, or the Azimuth whereon he rises or
sets, if you number the same from the middle line noted with XZ which here
represents the East and West Azimuths.

CHAP. IIII.
To find out the Declination of a Plain.
THe declination of a Plain is numbered from the South or North points toward
either East or West. And it is the arc of the Horizon comprehended between
the South-North, and a line infinitely extended upon the Horizon perpendicular
to the horizontall line of the Plain; which line may be called the Axis, and
the extremity of it, the Pole of the Plains horizontall line.

To find out this declination you must make two observations by the Sun: The
first is of the Distance or angle made between the Axis of the horizontall
line of the Plain, and the Azimuth wherein the Sun is at the time of
observation. The second is of the Suns Altitude. Both these observations should
be made at one instant, which may be done by two observers, but if they be
made by one, the less distance of time between them, will make the work to
agree together the better.

1. For the Distance. Upon your Plain draw a line parallel to the horizon, to
this line apply the side of your Quadrant, holding it parallel to the horizon.
Then holding up a thread and plummer, which must hang at full liberty, so as
the shadow of the thread may pass through the center of the Quadrant, observe
the Angle made upon the Quadrant by the shadow of the thread, and that side
that lies perpendicular to the horizontall line, for that angle is the
Distance required.

2. At the same instant as near as may be, take the Suns Altitude; These two
being heedfully done, will help you to the plains Declination by these rules
following.

When you have taken the Altitude, you may find the Suns Azimuth by the
former Chapter. Then observe, whether the Sun be between the Pole of the
horizontall line and the South North
point or not.

If the Sun be between them, add the Azimuth and Distance together, and the
sum of them is the Declination of the plain.

If the Sun be not between them, subduct the lesser of them from the
greater, and the difference shall be the Declination of the plain.

By your observation you may know to what coast a Plain declineth.

For if the South North
point be in the midst between the Suns Azimuth and the pole of the Plains
horizontall line, then does the Plain decline to the coast contrary to that
wherein the is: If otherwise, the declination is upon the same coast with the
Sun.

CHAP. V.
To find the Inclination of a Plain.
THe Inclination of a Plain is the angle that it makes with the Horizon. When
you have described your horizontall line upon a Plain, as in this figure OF,
cross it with a perpendicular GH, for the Vertical line.

And because the inclinations of the Upper and Under faces of the Plain, are
both of one quantity in themselves, if therefore you apply the side of the
Quadrant noted with AB unto the vertical line of the under face, or to the
under side of a Ruler applied to the vertical line of the upper face, as is
here showed in this figure; Then shall the degrees of the Quadrant give you CAD
the angle of inclination required.

CHAP. VI.
Of upright declining Plains.
THose Plains are upright, which point up directly into the Zenith or
vertical point of the Horizon, and may be tried by a perpendicular or
plumb-line. In these, as in the rest that follow, before the Hours can be
drawn, two things must be found; 1. The Rectifying arc; 2. The Elevation of
the Pole above the Plain.

1. To find the Rectifying arc.
Extend the thread from your Latitude counted in the upper Quadrant of the
circle on the backeside, to the complement of the Plains declination numbered
in the Semicircle; so shall the thread show you on the Diameter the Arc
required.

2. To find the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.
Extend the thread from the Rectifying arc numbered in he upper quadrant, to
your Latitudes complement taken in the Semicircle; so shall the thread show
upon the Diameter, the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.

According to these rules, in the latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. supposing an
upright Plain to decline 55. gr. 30 min. I find the Rectifying arc to be 28
gr. 36 min. And the elevation of the Pole above the Plain to be 20 gr. 10
minutes.

CHAP. VII.
In East and West incliners.
THose plains are called East and West incliners, whose horizontall line lies
full North and South, and their inclination is directly toward either East or
West.

1. To find the Rectifying Arc.
Extend the thread from your Latitudes complement taken in the upper quadrant
of the Circle on the backside, to the complement of the Plains inclination
counted in the semicircle; so shall the thread show upon the Diameter the Arc
required.

2. To find the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.
Extend the thread from the Rectifying-arke counted in the upper quadrant, to
your latitude taken in the Semicircle; so the thread upon the Diameter gives
the elevation of the Pole above the Plain.

Thus in the latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. If a Plain incline Eastward 40 gr. to
the horizon, the Rectifying-arke will be 35 gr. 58 min. And the elevation of
the Pole 37 gr. 26 min. above the plain.

CHAP. VIII.
In North and South incliners.
SUch Plains are called North and South incliners, whose horizontall line
lies full East and West, and their inclination is directly upon either North
or South.

1. For the Rectifying-Arke.
There is no use of it in these plains, because they all lie directly under
the Meridian of the place.

2. To find the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.
If the inclination be toward the South, add the inclination to your latitude;
for the sum is the Elevation of the pole above the Plain. If the sum
exceed 90 degrees, take it out of 180, and the supplement gives you the Poles
elevation.

If the inclination be Northward, compare the inclination with your latitude,
and subduct the lesser out of the greater: the Difference is the elevation of
the Pole above the Plain, If there be no difference, it is a Direct polar
Plain.

CHAP. IX.
In declining Incliners.
THose Plains are called Declining incliners, whose horizontall line declineth
from the East or West, toward either North or South, and their inclination
also deflecteth from the coasts of North and South toward either East or West.

The best way to find the Rectifying-arke, and the poles elevation for these
Plains, will be

First, to refer them to a New latitude, wherein they may lie as East or West
incliners. For which purpose you are first to find out an Arc, which in
respect of its use may fitly be called, The Prosthaphaereticall arc, it is
found by this rule:

Extend the thread from the complement of the Plains declination counted in
the upper quadrant, to the inclination numbered in the Semicircle; so the thread
shall give you upon the Diameter the Prosthaphaereticall-arke required.

This Prosthaphaereticall-arke is to be used as the Inclination was in the
precedent Chapter. For,

If the Plain do incline toward the South, it must be added to your
Latitude: and so the sum (if less then 90 degrees) gives you the New
Latitude: but if the sum be greater than 90, then the residue, or supplement
of it to 180 degrees will be the New Latitude required.

If the Plain incline toward the North, compare this Prosthaphaereticall-arke
with your Latitude, and subduct the lesser of them out of the greater; So the
Difference shall give you the New Latitude. If there be no difference, it is a
declining Polar plain.

Secondly, it will be required to know what Inclination these Plains shall
have in this their New latitude; and that is done by this rule:

Extend the thread from the Prosthaphaereticall-arke taken in the upper
quadrant to the Plains declination counted in the Semicircle: so the thread
shows on the Diameter, the New-inclination in their New latitude.

Being thus prepared, you may now proceed as in East and West incliners you did
before.

1. To find the Rectifying-Arke.
Extend the thread from the New latitudes complement taken in the upper
quadrant, to the New-inclinations complement numbered in the Semicircle; so the
thread upon the Diameter shows the Arc required.

2. To find the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.
Extend the thread from the Rectifying-arke in the Vpper-quadrant to the New
latitude in the Semicircle; so the thread upon the Diameter gives the Elevation
of the pole above the plain.

According to these rules, supposing a Plain to incline toward the North 30
degrees, and to decline from the South toward the West 60 degrees in the
latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. First I find the Prosthaphi-arke 60 gr. 6 min. and
because the Plain inclines toward the North; I compare this arc with the
Latitude of the place, and taking it out of the Latitude there remains 36 gr.
24 min. for the New Latitude. Then I find the New inclination to be 25 gr. 40
min. and so the Rectifying-arke 59 gr. 8 min. and the Elevation of the Pole
above the Plain to be 32 gr. 20 minutes.

CHAP. X.
To draw the Houre-lines upon the Horizontall, the full North or South plains,
whether standing upright or inclining.
IN the four last Chapters we have seen the uses of the Circle on the
backe-side of the Quadrant: in this and the next Chapter we shall show the use
of TR the line of latitudes, and of TV the line of Hours; which two lines with
the help of the limb VCTB, and of the thread and Bead, will serve to prick
down any Dial, by the Precepts hereafter delivered. And first we begin with
those Plains which have no declination, whose Poles lie directly under the
Meridian of the place; of which sort are the Horizontall, the Erect South and
North plains, with all Incliners looking directly North or South.

Having then by the former Precepts found the Elevation of the pole above your
Plain, you may begin your draught in this manner.

First, Draw the line RAT of sufficient length, and out of the line of
Latitudes in your Quadrant, take off the Elevation of the pole above the
plain, and prick it down from the point A, unto R and T both ways.

2. Take the line of Hours TV also out of the Quadrant, and with that extent
of your Compasses upon R and T as upon two centers, draw the arkes BV and CV,
crossing each other in V; and draw the lines RV and TV: then coming to your
Quadrant again;

3. Apply the thread to every hour point in the limb VT or CB, as first to s,
or r, so shall it cut the Line of hours TV in 1; Then take off with your
Compasses T1, and prick it down here from V to 1, and from T to 7. Again,
Apply your thread to the next hour in the limb at n or m, it will cut the
Line of hours TV in 2 take off T2, and prick it down here from V to 2, and
from T to 8. So again, the thread applied to the third noure at y, or u, cuts
the line TV, in 3; take off T3, and prick it down here from V to 3, and from
T to 9. In like manner, the thread applied to the fourth hour at o, or i, will
cut the line TV in 4 take off T4, and prick it down here from V to 4, and
from T to 10. So also the thread laid upon the fifth hour at e, or a, cutteth
TV in 5; take off T5, and prick it down here from V to 5, and from T to 11.
Thus are all the Hours pricked down.



An horizontull Dial to 52 gr: 30 m: lat:



Lastly then, laying your Ruler to the center A, through each of these points,
you shall draw the houre-lines A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, AV which is 12, A1, A2,
A3, A4, A5, RAT is the line of the two sixes. So having 12 hours, which is
half the Dial, drawn, you may extend the necessary lines, as many as you
will, beyond this center, as 5A5, 4A4, 7A7, 8A8, etc.

In the same manner may the half hours be pricked down and drawn, by
applying the thread to the half hours in the limb, etc.

And note also that in these Plains before mentioned; As the extent from V to
1, is the same with that from T to 7, so likewise is it the same with V11, R5;
And as V2 is the same with T8, so likewise is it the same with V10, R4: So
likewise V9 and T9 are all one, and both equal to R3 and V3. So that the three
first hours taken from the Quadrant, that is to say, T1, T2, T3, will give all
the hours for these Dialls. T1, gives V1, V11, R5, T7. T2, gives V2, V10, R4,
T8. T3, gives V3 or R3, V9 or T9. But in other Plains it is not so, for which
cause I have rather set down this way before at length, as a direction for
what comes after, for that is general.

Here note again, that if you desire to make your draught greater, you may in
your description either double or triple every length which you take in your
Compasses. And so I proceed to all declining Plains.

CHAP. XI.
To draw the Hours upon all sorts of declining Plains, whether erect or
inclining.
BY the former precepts you must first get the Rectifying-arke, with the
Elevation of the pole above the Plain. After they are had, you may prick
down the Hour points in this manner following, little differing from the
former.



A Plain* inclininge Eastward 40 gr:

The horizointall line, parallel to the line of 12.



1. Asbefore; Upon the line RAT, set off the Elevation of the pole above the
plain, being taken out of the line of latitudes in the Quadrant, from A both
ways, to R and T.

2. Take the line of Hours TV out of the Quadrant, and with that extent upon R
and T as upon two centers, describe the two arkes BV and CV crossing at V, and
draw the lines RV, TV, and AV. Thus far we go along with the last Chapter.

3. If we take the example in the seventh chapter, that plain is the upper
face of an East incliner, whose Elevation is 37 gr. 26 min. and so much does
this line TA reach unto in the line of Latitudes: the Rectifying arc is 35 gr.
58 min. This arc I number below in the limb of the Quadrant ES, and thereto
applying the thread I observe in the upper limb Vcb T which of the Hours and
where it cutteth, I find it to cut the slope line o u in the point P; to this
point P I set the Bead, which by this means is rectified and fitted to the
description of the Dial.

Here you see the use of the Bead, and the reason why this arc counted upon
the limb is called the Rectifying arc: and here be careful that you stretch
not the thread.

4. The thread and Bead being thus placed and rectified, you shall see the
thread to cut the line TV at a upon the Quadrant; take T a in your Compasses,
and prick it down here from V to 12, and from R to 6.

Here by the way observe, that because this plain is an Eeast-incliner, the
face of it looks toward the West, and then if you imagine the true situation
of this Dial upon the plain whereon it must stand, you will easily conceive
that the line of 12 is to stand on the right hand from the line AV. and so the
line of 6 on the left hand, whereas if this plain had faced toward the East,
the line of 12 must have stood on the left hand, and 6 on the right hand. Your
own conceit, together with the precepts of the chapter following, must help
in this, and in other things concerning the right scituating of the lineaments
of your Dial.

To proceed then,

In the same manner must you apply the Bead to every hour line, as in the next
place I remove it to the line y m in the Quadrant, and then I see it to cut the
line TV in b; I take 1 b in my Compasses, and with it do prick down from V
to 1, and from R to 7. Again, the Bead being applied to the lines nr, sb, the
thread will cut the line TV upon the Quadrant in c and d; I take the points TC,
Td, in my Compasses, and prick them down from V to 2 and 3, and from R to 8
and 9. Then again, the Bead applied to the lines ei, Va, the thread will cut
the line TV in the points e and o; I take then Te and Tf, and prick them down
from U ^o 11 and 10, and from R to 5 and 4.

5. Lastly, lay your rule to A, and draw A10, A11, A12, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6,
A7, A8, A9. Thus have you twelve hours, and if you extend these beyond the
Center, you shall have the whole 24 hours, of which number you may take those
that shall be fit for the Plain in this situation.

The half hours may thus be pricked on and drawn also, by applying the Bead
to the half hours pricked down in Vcb T the upper limb of the Quadrant, for
so the thread will give you the half hour points upon the line TV, which may
be taken off, and set down upon the Dial as the hours themselves were.

CHAP. XII.
How to place the Dial in a right Situation upon the Plain.
AFter the houre-lines are drawn by the last Chapter, they are to be placed in
a right situation upon their Plain. Which to do, upon some Plains is more
difficult than the Description of the Dial it self. To give some directions
herein, I have added this Chapter, where you have 9* Questions with their
Answers, giving light sufficient to what is here intended and required: but
first be admonished of three things.

1. That the inclination mentioned Chap. 8. is the very same in Use with the
Prosthaphaereticall arc mentioned Chapter 9. And therefore when I mention the
Prosthaphaereticall arc, because it is of most frequent use, you must remember
I mean both the Prosthaph: arc, Chap. 9, and the Inclination, Chap. 8.

2. That these rules, though given primarily for places of North-latitude,
lying within the Temperate, Torrid, and Frigid Zones, yet are also as true, and
may be applied to all places of South-latitude, if we exchange the names of
North and South, for South and North.

Here by the way note, that the North part of the Torrid Zone extends from 0
degrees of latitude to 23 gr. 30 min. the Temperate Zone reaches from 23 gr.
30 min. to 66 gr. 30 min. the Frigid Zone extends from 66 gr. 30 min. to 90
gr. of latitude. And so I come to the 9 Questions.

1. What Pole is elevated above the Plain.
Upon all Upright plains declining from the North: Upon the upper faces of all
East or West incliners: Upon the upper faces of all North-incliners, whose
Prosthaph: arc is less than the latitude of the place: On the under faces of
all North-incliners, whose Prosthaph: arc is greater then the Latitude of the
place; and on the upper faces of all South-incliners, The North pole is
elevated. And therefore contrarily,

Upon all upright Plains declining from the South: On the under faces of all
East and West, and South incliners: On the under faces of all North-incliners,
whose Prosthaphaereticall arc is less than the Latitude of the place: On the
upper faces of all North-incliners, whose Prosthaph: arc is greater than the
Latitude of the place, The South pole is elevated.

2. What part of the Meridian ascends or descends from the Horizontall line
of the Plain?
In all Upright plains the Meridian lies in the Vertical line, and if they
decline from the South it descends, if from the North it ascends.

Upon both faces of East and West Incliners the Meridian lies in the
Horizontall line.

In all North-incliners, the North part of the Meridian ascends, the South
part descends: in all South incliners the South part of the Meridian
ascends, the North part descends: upon both upper and under faces. And if
these North and South incliners be direct, then the Meridian lies in the
Vertical line, and so makes a right angle with the Horizontall line: but if
they decline, then the Meridian on the one side makes an acute angle with the
horizontall line.

3. To which part of the Meridian is the style with the substyle to be
referred, as making with it an acute angle?
The style is the cock of the Dial; the substyle is the line whereon it
stands, signed out in the former descriptions by the letters AV.

In all Plains whereon the North pole is elevated, it is referred to the North
part of the Meridian, and makes an acute angle therewith.

In all Plains whereon the South pole is elevated, it is referred to the South
part of the Meridian, and is to make an acute Angle therewith.

Except here only those South-incliners, whose Prosthaph: arc is more than the
complement of your Latitude: for on these plains the substyle stands on that
part of the Meridian, whose denomination is contrary to the Pole elevated above
the Plain. For on the upper faces the North pole is elevated, but the substyle
stands toward the South end of the Meridian: and on the under (...) the South
pole is elevated, but the substyle lies toward the North end of the Meridian.

Note here, that in South-incliners whose Prosthaphaereticall arc is equal to
the complement of your Latitude, the substyle lies square to the Meridian upon
the line of 6 a clock; which line in such plains always lies perpendicular
to the Meridian line. Amongst these falls the Equinoctial plain.

4. On which side of the Meridian lies the substyle?
In all direct plains it lies in the Meridian. In all Decliners it goes from
the Meridian toward that coast which is contrary to the coast of the plains
declination.

And so do all hours also go upon the Plain to that coast which is contrary
to the coast whereon they are; As all the morning or Eastern hours go to the
Western coast of the Plain, and all the Evening or Western hours go to the
Eastern coast of the Plain. Which being observed will be a great help to
place them aright.

5. What plains have the line of 12 upon them, and which not?
All upright Plains, in all latitudes whatsoever, declining from the South
have the line of 12; and decliners from the North in the temperate Zone have it
not, but in the other Zones they also have it.

The upper faces of East and West incliners in all Latitudes have it, the
underfaces have it not.

The upper faces of all North incliners whatsoever have it; their under faces
in the Temperate Zone want it, in the Frigid Zone have it, and in the Torrid
Zone likewise if the Prosthaph: arc be greater than the Suns least North
Meridian altitude, but if it be less they want it also.

For South incliners, consider the Suns greatest and least Meridian altitude
upon the South coast. For if the Prosthaphaereticall arc be such as falls
between them, that is, if it be greater than the least, or less than the
greatest, then have bothsides the line of 12 upon them; but if it be less than
the least, then does the Underface want it universally, and the upper face
alone has it* if greater than the greatest, then does the Upper face want it,
and the under face alone has it: Except in the Frigid Zone where the upper
face has it also, by reason of the Suns not setting there for a time.

6. Whether the North or South part of the Meridian serves for the line of 12?
In those Plains that have the line of 12, where the North pole is elevated,
there the North part of the Meridian serves for 12. and where the South pole
is elevated, there the South part of the Meridian serves for the line of 12 or
midday.

Except, in all Latitudes, the under faces of those South incliners, whose
Prosthaphaereticall arc falls between the Suns greatest and least
Meridian altitudes, for in them the South pole is elevated, but the North part
of the Meridian serves for the line of 12.

Except in special those Upright Plains in the Torrid-zone which look toward
the North, and the Under faces of North-incliners also, whose
Prosthaphaereticall arc is greater than the least North-meridian-altitude; for
these have the South or lower part of the Meridian serving for 12, though the
North pole be elevated.

7. Which way the style points, and how it is to be placed?
In Plains where the North pole is elevated, it points up toward it; and
where the South pole is elevated, it points down toward it.

The style lies perpendicularly over the substyle, noted in the former figures
with AV, and is to be elevated above it to such an angle as the Elevation of
the pole above the Plain shall be found to be by the 6, 7, 8, and 9 Chapters.

8. When is it that that part of the Meridian next the substyle, and the line
of twelve do go contrary ways?
In all Latitudes, Upon the upper faces of South-incliners, whose
Prosthaphaereticall arc is greater than the complement of the Latitude, but
less than the Suns greatest South Meridian altitude: And on the Under faces
of those South-incliners also, whose Prosthaph: is less than the complement of
the Latitude, but greater than the Suns least South meridian altitude: In the
Torrid-Zone alone you must add hither also, North upright Plains, and those
North-incliners on the Underface, whose Prosthaphaereticall-arke is greater
than the least North-meridian altitude of the Sun; for these have the line of
midday standing on that coast which is contrary to the coast of that part of
the Meridian next the substyle, and none else. The line of 12. I call herethe
line of midday because in the Frigid-zone, where the Sun sets not in many
days together, there are two twelves, the one answering to our midday, and the
other to our midnight: and so all Upper faces of South-incliners, whose
Prosthaphaereticall arc falls between the least and greatest South meridian
altitudes, have there two 12 a clockelines upon them.

9. How much the Meridian line ascends or descends from the Horizontall
line?
The quantity of the Angle is to be found upon the circle on the backside of
your Quadrant, in this manner;

Extend the thread from the complement of the Plains inclination taken in the
lower Quadrant, to the complement of the Plains declination counted in the
Semicircle, and the thread will show you upon the Diameter, the degrees and
minutes of the Meridians Ascension or Descension.

In the example of the 9. Chapt. taking the Upper face of that Plain, I find
the Meridian to ascend above the Horizontall line 33 gr. 41 minutes.

These directions are sufficient for the bestowing of every line into its
proper place and coast. As may be seen in the Example of the ninth Chapter.
For,
First, upon the upper face of that North incliner, because his Prosthaph: arc
16 gr. 6 min. is less than 52 gr. 30 min. the Latitude of the place, therefore
the North pole is elevated above it: by the Answer to the first Quest.

2. Because it is a North-incliner, therefore the North part of the Meridian
ascends above the Horizontall line, by the answer to the second Question.

3. Because the North pole is elevated, therefore the Style with the substyle
makes an acute angle with the North end of the Meridian, by the Answer to the
third Question.

4. Because this Plain declineth toward the West, therefore the substyle lies
on the East Side of the Meridian, and so do the hours of the afternoon: by
the Answer to the fourth Question.

5. This Plain, being the Upper face of the North-incliner, will have the line
of 12 to be drawn upon it, by the Answer to the fifth Question.

6. Because the North Pole is elevated, therefore the North part of the
Meridian serves for the line of 12: by the Answer to the sixth Question.

7. Because the North pole is elevated, therefore the style points upward
toward the North pole; by the Answer to the seventh Question.

8. That part of the Meridian next the Substyle, and the line of 12 are both
one, and so therefore go both one way: by the Answer to the eight Question.

9. By the second the Meridian line ascends, and the quantity of the ascent
is 33 gr. 41 min. above the Horizontall line: by the Answer of the ninth
Question.

Thus you see every doubt cleared in this example: the like may be done in all
others.

CHAP. XIII.
The making and placing of Polar Plains.
POlar Plains are those North incliners, whether direct or declining, that lie
in the Pole, and so have no Elevation of the Pole above them, as the direct
North Place this Diagram between folio 32. and 33.

The horizontall line of the Plain.

and South polar, the East and West upright Plains, and infinite others
declining betwixt both. You may know them by the 8 and 9 Chapters, as is there
intimated.

These Plains may have Dialls described upon them by this Quadrant, but the
better way is the common way, to protract them by an equinoctial circle, for
otherwise the style will be always of one distance from the Plain, be the Dial
greater or lesser.

The Polar plains that decline, before they can be described, must have their
New-inclination known, and then their delineation will be easy, the manner of
it may be seen in this Example.

Suppose the upper face of a North-inclining Plain, lying in the Latitude of
52 gr. 30 min. to decline from the South toward the East 68 gr. and to incline
toward the North 73 gr. 57 min. you shall find by the ninth Chapter, the
Prosthaph: arc to be 52 gr. 30 min. the same with the Latitude of the place,
and therefore you may conclude this plain to be Polar. By the same Chapter you
shall find the New inclination to be 63 degrees.

When you have these you may draw your Semicircle AB4, and divide it into 12
equal parts for the hours: so signing the new-inclination 63 degrees from A
to B, draw CB: and supposing the altitude of your style to be CD, through D
draw the perpendicular D 12; and where the lines drawn from C through the
divisions of the semicircle do cut the line D 12, there raise perpendiculars
for the hours, and so finish it up as the manner is. The style lies directly
over and parallel to the substyle CB, and the distance of it from the plain is
CD, and in this Example the substyle CB stands from the line of 12 Westward,
because the plain declineth Eastward, according to the rules in the former
Chapter, and so do the morning hours also.

For the placing of the Dial in a true site upon the Plain, you shall find by
the answer to the 9 Quest. in the former Chapter, that the Meridian ascends
55 gr. 38 min. for other necessaries, the precepts of the former Chapter will
direct you. Only observe, that in Upright East and West plain, the line of 6
is always the substyle, and it ascends above the North end of the
Horizontall line, as much as the Latitude of the place comes to.

FINIS.
AN APPENDIX Showing a ready way to find out the Latitude of any place by the
Sun.
BEcause in the third Chapter, and quite through this Treatise, the Latitude of
the place is supposed to be known, when as every one perhaps cannot tell
which way to find it out; I thought good therefore to add this Appendix as a
ready help to show how it may be attained sufficiently for our purpose. Know
then that for the finding out of the Latitude of a place by the Sun, these
things are required.

1. To find the Meridian line.
The readiest way to find the Meridian line is by the North-starre. This star
is within 2 degr. 37 min. of the North Pole. The North Pole lies very near
between Allioth, or the root of the great Bears tail, and this star; You
may therefore imagine where the Pole is, if you conceive a right line drawn
from the Pole-starre to Allioth, and by your imagination suppose parts of the
distance of the next star of the little Bears tail from the Pole-starre
toward Allioth, for there is the very Pole-point. Now then if you set up two
poles aslope, and from the tops of them hang two cords with weights at the ends
of them, and turn them till you standing on the South Side of them may see
them both together with the Pole-point, as it were all in one line, then be
sure these two cords do hang in the Meridian line, or very near it, yea so
near it, that though you should err 3 degrees herein (wherein you need not to
err one degree) yet will not the Meridian altitude in these Climates
(especially more Northward) fail you above 3 minutes, which is near enough to
our purpose. I have here given you the chief stars of the great and little
Bears, that by them you may come to know the stars used in this observation,
and so find the very Pole-point it self.

2. To find the Suns Meridian altitude.
Observe diligently about noone when the shadow of the South cord shall fall
upon the North cord, for then is the Sun in the Meridian. At that instant
observe the Suns altitude stedily and carefully, for that is the Meridian and
greatest altitude of the Sun for that day.

3. To find the Suns declination.
For this purpose the limb has the characters of the 12 Signs fixed to each
30 degree, and a scale of declinations under the limb noted with MN. The Scale
is divided by this table; for look what degr. and min. of the Eclipt. do
answer to the degr. of declination in the table, the same are to be numbered in
the limb, and by a ruler applied to them, the degrees of declination are
drawn upon the Scale.

Before you can find the Declination, you must know the Suns place, and for
such as know not the use of the Astronomicall tables, an Almanacke will serve,
where for every day at noone, you shall find the Suns place in signs,
degrees and minutes. The degr. and min. must be numbered in their Signs upon
the limb, and the thread applied thereto will show the declination answerable.
As for example. September 21. 1637 in the Almanac for this year, the Sun is
found to be in 8 gr. 23 min. of. In the Quadrants limb I look for the Sign
and number there, 8 gr. 23 min. whereto apply the thread, I find it to cut in
the scale of Declinations 3 gr. 20 min.

4. By the Meridian Altitude, and declination of the Sun had; how to find the
Latitude of the place, or the Elevation of the Pole above the Horizon.
Compare the Suns Meridian altitude and declination together, and if the
Sun be in a North Sign as, then substract the declination out of the
Meridian altitude, so shall the difference give you the height of the
Equinoctial. But if the Sun be in the South Signs, as, then add the
declination to the Meridian altitude, so shall the sum give you the height of
the Equinoctial, which being taken out of the Quadrant or 90 degrees, leaves
the Latitude of your place, or the Elevation of the Pole above your Horizen.

For Example. Upon the 21 of September 1637. I observed the Suns altitude in
the Meridian to be 34 gr. 10 min. Upon which day I find the Suns place to be
(as before) 8 gr. 23 min. of, and the declination 3 gr. 20 min. And because the
Sun is in a South sign, I add this declination and Meridian altitude
together; the sum 37 gr. 30 min. is the altitude of the Equator, and this
taken out of 90 degrees leaves 52 gr. 30 min. for the Latitude of Coventrie.
