THOMAS BECON.


A confortable Epistle / too Gods faithful people in England / wherein is
declared the cause of taking away the true Christen religion from them / and
how it may be recovered and obtained again / newly made by Thomas Becon.

Abacuk. 2. Though the Lord tarry / yet wait thou for him / for he will
undoubtedly come / yea / and that out of hand.

Imprynted at Strasburgh in Elsas, at the sign of the golden Bibel in the
month of August. In the year of the LORD M. D. LIIII.

The Epistle. The first Chapter.
TO the faithful Christians / wheresoever they be dispersed thorowoute the
realm of England / Thomas Becon wis^heth / grace / mercy and peace from God
the father / with perfect knowledge of his dearly beloved son Jesus Christ our
Lord / and alone savior through the halowinge of the holy Ghost / unto the
true and unfeigned obedience off Gods most blessed will / with an earnest faith
in the merciful promises of God / and assured hope of obtayninge the same / unto
everlasting life. AMEN.

IT greatly rejoices me (mos^e dear brethren) to hear of this your
constancye and stedfastnes in believing and confessing the glorious Gospel of
our savior Jesus Christ (which as the apostle Romans 1.
says / is the power of God to save so many as believe) namely in these
perilous and troublesome days / wherein we se so many sturte back and run
away from the co^ fession of Gods truth (which when the weather was calm /
they seemed constantly to profess) and follow the fond fantasyes of men /
that speak not Gods word, but their own drowsy dreams and idle imagi
nations brought into the church of Christ by subtle satan and his marked
marchau^ te^ / unto the great disturbaunce of the Chri sten common wealth / so
that / if it were possible / the very elect and chosen people off God / through
their ^ugsing might be seduced Mat. 24.
and led from the way of truth. As ye have godly begone / so manfully go
forth unto the end / that ye may receive a full joy and a perfect reward of
the Lord your God in that day / when he gloriously shall apeare and render to
every one according to his deeds / that is to say / praise / honor / and
immortalite to them / which continue in good doing and seek eternal life. But
unto them that are rebellious and disobey the truth and follow iniquity /
shall come indignacio^ / and wrath / tribulacion and anguishe. But be it known
unto you dear brethren / that this thing that has happened unto us in this
realm of England / Roma. 2.
I mean the taking away of Gods true religion / and the thrusting in of
pa^istrye in the stead thereof / unto the great and unspeakable sorrow of all
true Christen hearts / ought not to seem unto you new strange and unlooked for
/ but rather such a thing as has hitherto many times been declared unto you
by the preachers / and ye your selfs godly co^sydering the corrupt manners and
unlucky chances of this realm / did right well the same aforesee and
greatly lament. For diverse signs had we long before / besides the godly
admonicions of the faithful preachers / which plainly declared unto us an
utter subuersyon of the true Christen religion to be at hand / except it were
prevented by has^ye and hartye repentance. What shall I speak of that godly
and mighty prince Edward / duke of Somerset / which in the time of his Pro The
(...) of Somerset
tectorship did so banyshe Idolatrye out of this our realm / and bring in
again Gods true religion / that it was wonder so weyghty a matter to be brought
to pass in so (...) a time? Was not the ungentle handlyng of him / and the
unrighteous thrustinge him out of office / and afterward the cruel mur thering
of him / a man / yea / a myrrour off true innocencye and Christen patience / an
evident token of Gods anger against us? The sudden taking away of those mo^e
goodly and verteous young Impes / the duke of Suffolk and his brother / by the
sweating The (...) of (...) and his brother.
syckenesse / was it not also a manifes^ token of Gods heavy displeasure
toward us? The death of those two most worthy and godly learned men / I speak
of M. Paulus M. Paulus Fagius. D Martine Bucer.
Fagius / and of D. Martine Bucer / was it not a sure Prognostication / some
great mishappe / concerning Christen religion to be at hand? But as I may
pass over many other / and at the last come unto that / which is most
lamentable / and can never be remembered of any true English heart / without
large tears / I mean the death of our most godly Prince and Christen king
Edward the. VI. that true Josias / that earnest Ring Edward the (...).
destroyer of false religion / that fervent setter up of Gods true honor / that
most bounteous Patron of the godly learned / that most worthy mayntayner of
good let ters and virtue / and that perfect and liuelye myrrour of true
nobili^e and sincere godliness: was not the taking away of hi (alace for sorrow)
asure sign and an evident toke^ that some great euel hanged over this realm of
England? Who considering these things (as I may speak nothing of the wicked
Gross gospelers.
nes of those me^ / which made the word of God a cloak of their naughtines /
of their insatiable covetousness / of their intolerable pride, of their
volupteous and wanton living. etc.) perceived not a shepwracke of the Christen
religion too be at hand / as it is (alace for pytie) come to pass at this
day? All good men feared the decay of Gods true honor in this realm /
that we feared / that has chanced / how could it otherwise come to pass?
Gods blessing was offered unto us* but we through our wicked and unthankful
life refused it. Shall not therefore blessing be taken away / and cursinge come
in the place thereof? as it is written / he would not have the blessing / it
shall therefore Psalm. 109.
be far from him.

The. ii. Chapter.
IF the kingdom of God be proffered unto us / and we set not by it / are we not
worthy England blessed* (...)
to loose it? What realm since the Apostles time was ever so abundantly
replenished with the knowledge of Christ's Gospel yea / and that in so few
years / as this realm of England was? But alace how was it regarded? Who
repented? who know ledged his sin from the very heart? Who called on the name
of God in spirit and truth? Who framed his life / according to his
knowledge? It is therefore come too pass / as our Savior Christ long before
threatened / the kingdom of God shall be taken Math. 21.
from you and shall be given to a nation / that brings forth the fruits
thereof. God planted this realm of England / a pleasant and goodly vineyarde /
dressing and trymming it after Esa. (...).
the best manner / lokynge contynuallye to have some worthy frut thereof / but
w^ in the stead of natural grapes / it brought forth wild beryes /
unwholesome and unnatural / was it not worthy too be laid wayste / to be
trodden under foot / and to be devoured of wild beasts? Were not the people
of the old world worthy too be Genesis 7. 2. Pet. 2.
overwhelmed with waters / which being of righteous No he so often before
admonisshed / would not repent / and make provision for the avoiding of that
plague? Were not the filthy Sodomites worthy to be consumed Genesis 19. 2. Pet. 2.
with fire and brymstone from heaven / which being before told of their
destruction would not cease through their abominable living to provoke the
heavy wrath and fearse vengeance of God against them? Were not the
Israelites worthy to be plagued even unto the death / when they despisyng /
lothyng and abhorring Manna / which Exodus 17
came down from heaven / lusted after the vile flesh of the earth? Were not
the Jews worthy to be led away miserable captives and wretched prisoners /
to serve strange princes in farreyne countries / which would 4. Re. 25
not serve their Lord God in their own cou^ try / a land that flows with
milk and honey? Was it not convenient / that the Matt. 21. Marc. 12. Luc. 20.
people of Judah should be oppressed / yea / destroyed both they and their
cy^es of their enemies the Romans / which refused Ie sus Christ / their
trueliege and souerayg^e Lord to reygne over them / and most cruelty put him
to death? Were they not worthy Mat. (...).

we are co^^elled daily to hear such Antichristian tro^pet^lowers / such

the Christen common weal of the true Israelites? ^erely our ingratitude /
our vnthankeful^s / our unkindness / yea / our churlyshenes toward God and
his holy word has caused all these miseries / worthily to fall upon us. We
were weary of the heavenly Mauna / and had a pleasure to return unto Egypt /

will God send the^ a s^ro^g illusio^ to believe lies. Is not this the sayng of
our savior Christ? this is conde^nacion / that light is come into Joan. 3.
the world / and me^ have loved darkness more tha^ light / for their works
were evil. The thing therefore that brought this co^de^nacio^ this darkness /
this blyndnes vpo^^s / is the hating of the light of Gods word / our
unthankfulness for the benefits of Christ's Gospel / and our sinful life
replenished with all kind of wickedness. These things / these things made God
to withdraw the most pleasant and comfortable light of his loving co^tenau^ce
from us / and to suffer the prince of dar kenes to shadow us with his wings of
hellish ignorau^cy and deuelish blindness unto our great disco^fort and
continual sorrow. God have mercy on us / and bless us / and show us the light
of his co^tena^ce^ / and be merciful unto us / that Psalm. 67.

Amen.

suffer our selfs continually to be wrapped and covered in with the dredefull
clouds of popysh blyndenes? God forbid. Yea / rather let us with a lusty
courage and bold spirit hunte out and seek some means / whereby we may be
dispatched of this most miserable plague / wherewith we are at this present
justly stryken for our vntha^kefulnes and wicked life / and so recover the
favor of God / that we may once again walk in the heavenly light of his most

/ as the prophet says: Your wickednesses have made a wall Esa. 59.

evil can not Psalm. 5.

disobedience against Gods most blessed will. Let us eue^ with tears / as
Peter and Magdalene did Matt. 26. Luc. 7.
lament and bewail our wretchednesses / being most heartily sorry / that we
ever offended so loving a father / and so merciful a Lord. For this unfeigned

Moses and all the Prophets / Ihon Baptiste / Christ and al his disciples / as
the holy scriptures testefie. For with out repentance nothing is to be had of
God but wrath / dis pleasure and everlasting damnation / as our savior Christ
says: Except ye repent / all sort of you shall perysh. But where true
repentance comes / and an earnest hate off Luc. 1^.
sin / with a fervent study of innocence and amendment of life / there
lyghe the grace / mercy / favor and good will of God / bent out for the
penitent sinner / as God him self says by the Prophet: If the ungodly turn
away from all his sins that he Ezec. 18.
has done / and shall keep all my statutes / and do judgment and righteonsnes
/ he shall su^ely live and not dye. All his offenses shall no more be laid before
him / but in his righteousness that he has done / shall he live For I have no
pleasure in the death of a sinner / says the Lord God / but rather that he
turn from his wicked ways and live. Again / as surely as I live / says the
Lord Ezech. (...)
God / I have no delighte in the death of a sinner / but rather that he should
turn from his ways and live. Turn ye / turn ye from your evil ways / and
why will ye dye O ye house of Israel? Diverse examples have we hereof in the
holy scripture / as the Examples of repe^ta^ce.
children of Israel / the Ninevites / David / ^anasses / Peter / Magdalene / the
thief / and such other* which after they repented / found favor at the
merciful hand of God. As we have followed them in synning and doing euel / so
let us follow them in repenting and doing well. Than may we be sure to find
like favor with them. For it is written: Psalm. ^4
the Lord is at hand for them / that are off a troubled heart / and the broken
in spirit will he heal and save.

The. v. Chapter.
SEcondly to this hearty repentance must a true and Christen faith be annexed
/ Faith.
which apprehends and lays hand on the merciful promises of God frelye
setforth to all faythefull penitent sinners in Christ's dear heart blood. For
without this faith and perfect persuasion of Gods favor toward us /
Repe^tau^ce is vain / as Repe^tau^ce and faith must go together.
the histories of Caym / Esau / Saul / Achab / Judas / and of such other do
manifestly declare. In consideracion whereof our Savior Christ / when he
began to preach / said not only to his hearers / Repent, but he added /
And believe the Gospel, teaching that true repentance must be joined Mar. 1.
with Christen faith / or else it profits nothing. An example hereof besides
many other / have we in the history of the sinful woman / in the Gospel of
saint Luke / which Luce. 7.
did not only repent earnestly / as her bitter tears / sorowefull sobbynges
and deep syghynges do plainly declare / but she also faithfully believed /
being constantly persuaded / that she although a most wicked sy^er should
obtain remission of all her sins at God the fathers hand for Jesus Christ's
sake his derely beloved son / whose fete at that present she ceased not too
kiss / whose fete she washed with her tears / wyped with her hair / and
anointed with most precious pleasant oil. Our Savior Christ / therefore
beholding her true repentance conjoined with undoubted faith / said not
only to her / Thy sins are for^euen the / but he added / Thy says has
saved the, depart with peace, that is too say / with a quiet / free /
ioyefull and merrye conscience. Let us bring for the this faythefull
repentance Note.
and repentaunte faith / and with all humility pour out our sins before
the gracious throone of Gods Majesty / and hartel^e crave remyssyon and
forgeuenes off all our sins / in the precious blood off our Savior Ih^u
Christ / and without all doubt God will ^e favorable unto us / have pytie on
us / and lighten his chereful countenance once again upon us / that we on the
earth may know his ways and his sauinge health among all nations. For the
Lord our God is full of compassion and mercy / long suffering / and of great
goodness. He will not always be chyding / neither keeps he his anger Psalm. 103.
for ever. He will not deal with us after our sins / nor reward us /
according too our wickedness. For look how hye the heaven is in c^parison of
the earth / so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him. Look how
wide also the East is from the West / so far will he set our sins from us.
Yea / like as a father pitieth his own children / even so will the Lord be
merciful Esa. 38. Miche. 7
unto them that fear him. All our sins will he cast behind his back /
into the bottom of the sea will he throw them / and never remember them more /
yea / if our sins / as the Prophet says / be as red as s^arlet / Esa. 1.
yet shall they be made whyther then snow. And if they were like purple / yet
shall they be like white wolle / if we unfeignedly repent / turn unto the Lord
our God / believe his promises / and crave mercy of him for Christ's sake.

The. vi. Chapter.
THyrdly / earnest diligence must be ge^en / Good wor ^es.
that according to this true repetaunce and unfeigned faith we bring forth good
works. For the nature of hearty repentance and of Christen faith is not to be
idle / but mightily to work / to change the penitente creature / and to
transform him into a new man / that he may serve the Lord his God in
holiness and righteousness all the days of his life. If there be not an
alteracio^ of life / if the old man be not Ephe. 4.
put of with all his works / and the n^we man put on / which is made according
unto God / through righteousness / if those (...) Roma. 6.
which before were servants to uncleanness and unrighteousness / do not now
become servants to cle^nes / righteousness and holiness / without all doubt
we have neither true repentance nor unfeigned faith / whose nature and
property is to bring forth new spiritual and godly fruits / as the Apostle
says: If any man be in Christ / he is a new creature. Again / they that are
of Christ / 2 Cor. (...). Galat. 5.
have crucified the flesh with the affectes and lusts thereof. Therefore the
holy preacher Ihon Baptiste / that priests son did not Math. 3.
only exhort his hearers unto repe^tau^ce / but also unto amendment of life
/ and unto the bringing forth of such fruits / as become true and faithful
repentance. Bring forth fruits / says he / worthy of repentance Math. 3
etc. For now is the axe laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore
/ that brings not forth good fruit / is hewe^ up and cast into the fire.
And our Savior Christ says: Not every one that sayethe Math. 7.
unto me / Lord / Lord / shall enter into the kingdom of heaven / but he
that does the will of my father / which is in heaven. Again / ye are my
friends / if ye do those Joan. 15. Joan. 14.
things / which I command you. Item / he that has my commandments and
keeps them / he it is that loves me. Also in another place / Let your light
so shine Math. 5.
before men / that they may se your good works / and glorifye your father
which is in heaven. These fruits of faythefull repentance / which are the
true good works / that God requires of us too be done in the holy scripture /
and not such as good intent / blyndezele / or man's idle imaginacio^
fantasyeth / ought to be brought forth / when time requires of every true
Christen man / to declare that his faith and repentance is true and unfeigned.
We may not therefore / if we tender our own salvation / and will recover the
favor of God / be ^lacke and sluggyshe in bringynge forth these weyghty
fruits of repentance and faith / but so adourne / garnyshe / deck Note.
trymme and setforth our life with them / that it may appear too all men /
ye^ / too the very adversaries of God / that our repentance is true / and
our faith unfeigned / and that we be true Christians / not only in name / but
also in deed* and not off the number of those / of whom the Apostle writes on
this manner: They profess (with their mouth) that they know God Titus. 1.
but with they: bebes they deny him. And albeit / at all times it were
convenient / that the true Christians shouldbe bring forth the works of
repentance / and the fruits of faith / and led a life worthy their
profession / yet in these our days it is most requisite. For who consydereth
not / with how great a number of enemies / I mean the devil and the papists
/ the true Christians are enuyroned and be set in these our days / which do
nothing else but diligently mark / what they may find in us* worthy to be
rebuked* that by (...) means they may slander the good doctrine that we
profess and bring us ^ute of credit with all men / that they may go forth
the more frelye to lie / as they have begun largely all redye / and tosowe

therefore / that the true (...) of God and of his blessed word / (...) in these
our days seek all means possible so to garnish their life with good works /
that in all things they may do honor to the doctrine of Christ our

stop the mouths of the wicked and ungodly adversaries by well doing / as
(...). Peter 1. Pet. 2.
admonishes / saying: this is the will ofGod / that by well doing / ye should
stop the mouths of folish and ignoraunte people / as fre and not as having
a liberty to be a cloak of noughtynes / but as the servants of God. Again /
^erely beloved / I beseech you as strangers and pylgrimes / abstain from
fleshly lusts / which fight against the soul / and have an honest
conversation among the ^eathen / that in that they do bacbyte you as euel doers
/ they judging you of your good works / may glorify God in the day of
visitacio^. Hereto agrees the saying Phil. 2.
of s. Paul: Do al thing without murmu ring and disputing / that ye may be
fautles and pure / and the sons of God without rebuke in the mids of a
crooked and a perverse nation / among which se that ye shine as lights in the
world / holdinge fast the word of life. For there is nothing that so

strikynge The pap^ stes (...) (...).

Christians / (...) contrariwyse / nothing gladdeth them (...) / tha^ to se our
life dissolute and swar ^ng from our profession. For than like hell hounds
yell they out and say: Behold your Protestants. Se your new Gospelers.
Consider their life. Note their manners. Mark their conversation. Where is
found the like pride / covetousness / falls bargayning / crafty byeng and
sellinge / oppressing of the poor / raising of rentes / taking of incomes /
idle words / vayn oaths / super fluous bancketting / cont^pte of the poor /
unmercifulness / breakinge of promise / untruth / with all that ever setforth a
wicked and ungodly life? O what a sto^bling block is this to weak
consciences? What a (...) o nour to the word of God? What a slander to the
Christen profession? What a decay to godly religion? What auauncement of
Papistrie and Idolatry? What encouragement to the blind to persevere in their
blyndnes? What a glory to the wicked Pa pistes / and a confirmacion to their
abho^ nable and deuelish doctrine? Therefore if we tender the glory of God /
the auau^cem^t of his true religion / and the salvation off our own souls /

The. ix. Chapter.
THat God shows his present help In greatest extremities God chiefly helps.
most of all in greatest extremities / diverse histories declare euidentlye in
the holy scriptures / whereof part briefly to touch / it shall not be out of
the way / that we may learn in the midst of greatest euels not to despayr
of the mighty workyng of God / but to conceive asure hope / and to look for all
good things at the hand of the Lord our God. Who knows not unto what great
extremity the children of Exodus 14
Israel were brought after their deliuerau^ce out of Egipte? Came they not to
this point in their iourneye / that before them there was no way to go into /
but the readde sea / wherein they must needs be drouned / if they went forward
/ and behind them was king Pharao with all his army / ready to slay them / if
they tarryed? Here natural reason saw nothing but present death. Before
them was the readde sea / unable to be passed through / and behind them their
mortals for with his bloody and cruel hooste ready to kill them. Oh / to what
extremities are the Israelites come? Yet behold / Psalm. 145 1. Cor. 10
that merciful God / which is ever true and faithful in his promises / found
a way for them to escape / where all reason / wit / wisdom / discrecion /
experience / and pollecye of man could do nothing in the matter. He caused the
sea to divide it self / so that in the midst thereof he made a dry pathe for
his people safely to pass through / the sea standing on both sides of them
like two walls / and the Israelites being once passed through / that which
was a safegarde too Gods people / was an utter destruction to their enemies.
For the sea ate the commandment of God closed again together / and drouned
Pharao with all his company. O the wonderful works of God.

Again / when they were come into the wilderness / Exo. 16. 17.
where neither meat nor drink was to be gotten / and they judging after na
turall reason / thought that every one off them should there most miserablye
have dyed for want of socour / how did the heavenly father in that extremity
provide for his people / by sending them meat from heaven / and geuinge them
most pleasant and sweet waters / even out of the hard rock (...) drink?
O the exceeding great riches of the Lord our God.

To whom is the historye of Joseph unknown / Gene. 39
who being miserably kept in prison certain years without just cause /
every man despayred of his deliverance at any time. But when all things seemed
to be paste remedy / and the matter brought to utter desperacion / concerning
his coming out: God sets too hand / and does not only deliver Joseph
out of prysonne / Gene. 41
but he also brings him to such honor and dignity / that he is made
chief ruler over all the land of Egipte next unto the King. O the singular
good will of the Lord our God toward his faithful and loving servants.

What shall I speak of that most noble 4. Re. 18.
and faithful king Ezechias / which being in most grievous danger / both he
and his contries / through the tyranny of Sennacherib that most proud king of
the Assyria^s / which was at hand to destroy both him and his realm / and not
perceauing how he and his people with all their wit / pollecy and stre^ght
were able to enter battle with so mighty an enemy / utterly despairing of his
own might and power / lamented his cause unto the Lord his God which so petied
the sorrowful estate of king Ezechias and of his people / that even the same
night he sent his au^gel / which slew 4. Re. 19.
in the hooste of the Assyria^s an. c. lxxx. and five thousand / so that
Sennacherib with the rest of his hooste fled / which shortly after / as he was
worshipping his false God / was slain of his own sons in the idolatrous
temple. O the pricelike puissau^ce of the Lord our God / in defending his
faithefull people. Notable is the history contained in the book of Hester /
concerning the Jews / which were the people of God / where we Hest. (...).
read that wicked Ama^ / being highest in autho rite with king Ahasuerus / for
displeasure that he bare unto Mardocheus the Jew / because he would not bow
the knee unto hi^ / and reverence him / procured of the king a commandment
to be directed unto all his officers and magistrates / that all the Jews /
that were within the kings dominions / should be destroyed. And as for
Mardocheus / Ama^ had prepared for him a new pair of galowes of. l. eubites
hye / purposinge to hang him the next days following. Here was nothing at hand
/ nor to be looked for / but present death and destruction. All was like to go
to havoc / all things were brought to such an extremity. The commission is
written and sealed with the Kings own ring. Posts are sent with it into
all the kings lands / the day is appointed / that all Jews / both young and
oldechyldren and women should be destroyed in one day. What is here too be
seen / but present death? The Jews are not an handful in comparison of their
enemies / so that utter destruction lygheth bent out for them / and no way
there is to escape it / so far as rea son can judge. But now behold Gods
workinge / and here shall ye find that thing true / which Solomon has: The
kings Pro. 21.
heart is in the hand of the Lord / like as are the ryuers of water / he may
turn it / whyther so ever he will. Aman / which before Hest. 7.
was so much set by of the king / is now suddenly so far fallen from the
kings favor / Bevvare ye papists.
that he is commanded to be hanged upon those same gallows / that he had set
up for good Mardocheus / so that Mardocheus was made ruler of all that Ama^ had
/ and was exalted unto hye dignity / that that may be found true / which we
read in the Psalm: I said unto the fools / deal not Psalm. 75.

one / and sets up another. Again / the ungodly sees the righteous / and
seeks occasion to slay him. But the Lord will not leave him in his hand /
nor condemn him / wha^ he is judged. Immediately / after also was a contrary
commandment sent out by the Hest. 8. 9

of the kings May not God thus vvorbe in the O^enes heart, for his faithful

dominions by no means to trouble or too vex the Jews / but to take them as
most dear / faithful and louinge subjects of the King / and if any would
withstand the Kings commandment in this behalf / that the Jews should
gather them selfs together / and slay their enemies / and take away their
goods. Thus suddenly was sorrow turned into joy / heaviness into mirth sadness
into gladness / slavery into honor / darkness into light / and death into
life. O the unspeakable power of the Lord our God.

To whom is the history of the. iij. iong Dan. 3.
men unknown / which / because they would not worship the golden Image at the
kings commandment were cruelly cast into an whote bre^ning oven? Who would
not have judged their life utterly lost? But God / which helps in most
extremities / so provided / that the fire did hurt them nothing at all / no /
not so much as an hay^e of their head perished with the fiire / nor no part
of their garments. Whole and sound came they out of the brenninge furnace /
unto the great glory of God. O the fatherly care of the Lord our God / for all
such as cleue to his holy and blessed word.

The history of casting the prophet Daniel Dan. 6.
into the den of Lions / because contrary to the Kings commandment / he
prayde unto the Lord his God / is not unknown to them that read the holy
scriptures. Who durst have promised Daniel any life / bei^ thus cast down
unto the hungrye and cruel Lions? yet God was present with him / and stopped
the Lions mouths / that they did not once hurt him. O the loving kyndnes of
the Lord our God toward all them that call on his holy name / and put
their trust in him.

I pass over the histories of the cytiesins of Bethulia / of Job / of Thoby /
of Susan / and of diverse other contained in the old testament / which in all
their necessities and troubles / calli^g on the name of god / proved his
present help / which by no means would suffer them to perish. All these
things Romans 14
are written for our learning / that through patience and comfort of the
scriptures we should have hope.

When Christ and his disciples were in the shipp^ / Christ at a certain time

The disciples perceiving them selfs too be in great danger and peril of
drownynge / and not knowing what to do / nor how to escape / came unto Christ
/ awoke him and said: Master / save us / we peryshe. Christ answered: Why
are ye afraid / O ye of littell faith? Then he arose and rebuked the wyndes
and the sea / and there followed a great calm. O the tender mercy of the Lord
our God / toward all such as in the time of their trouble fie unto his name
as unto a strong bulwark. This historye teaches us / that though the seas
and the wyndes / yea / though the deuel and the world rise / rore / rage and
ruffle against us never so much / yet if we fie unto God with hearty and
faithful prayer / he will surely help us / so that nothing shall hurt us /

The like historye read we of Peter / which when he saw Christ walkinge on
Math. 14
the sea / said: Lord / bid me come unto the on the water. Christ said /
come. And wh^ Peter was come down out of the ship / he walked on the water
to go to Jesus. But when he saw a mighty wind / he was afraid. And when he
began to syncke / he cried / saying: Lord save me. And immediate lie / Jesus
stretching forth his hand / caught him and said unto him / O thou of little
faith / wherefore dedist thou doubt? O the merciful favor of the Lord our
God toward his weak and feeble creatures. Here find we the saying of the
Prophet true / A broosed read / shall he not break / and smoking Esaias. 42.
flax shall he not quench.

But as I may at the last come too the history of our Savior Christ / Who
sees not ^he mighty power of God / in raisinge up Christ crucifyde and dead

impossible? The Jews now promised the^ selfs many fair holy days / great

The. xi. Chapter.
Moreover / in the Acts of the Ap^stles Acto. 12.
we read / that after king Herod had killed James / the brother off Ihon with
the swearde / he laid hand on Peter / and put him in prison / committing him
to four quaternions of soldiers to be kept / and entendinge after Easter to
bring him forth to the people / and so to kill him. But prayer was made
without ceasing of the congregation to God for him. Here Peter was apprehended
/ cast into prison / bound with chains / warders appointed to keep him / and
all things so handled / that he should by no means escape / but all times be
ready at the first call to be brought forth unto death. Peter looked
continually for present death. Herod and the Jews persuaded them selfs to be
sure of Peter to kill him at their pleasur / as though they had slain him all
ready. But behold the mighty power of God / which fyndeth a means to deliver
his servants / when reason sees no way to escape. The night before that
Peter should be brought forth to death / there was a very diligente watch /
because they would be sure of him. Peter him self was bound with two chains.
Two soldiers also kept him in the prison / one on the one side of him / and
another on the other side. Besides this / there were kepers set before the door
to keep the pryso^. All things were as sure as might be. Peter was paste all
hope of deliverance. He committed the matter unto God / and gave him self to
rest / loking the next day after to have been slain. And while Peter was
Note vve^ and despair no^.
a sleep / and had given over the matter / God wrought / and sent his angel
into prison unto Peter / which wonderfully brought him out of prison / and
delivered him from all danger. Read the chapter. O the almighty power of the
Lord our God / in the deliverance of his servants. If God de termineth too
save alive / who is able too put to death? Here se we the saying of our Math.
1^
Savior Christ to be true / that all the hay res of our head are numbered /
and that not ^ne of them shall perish without the good will of our heavenly
father. Here is that verified / which is spoken by the Psalmogra Psalm. 34.
phe / the aungel of the Lord py^cheth his te^t round about them / that fear
him / and delivers them. Great are the troubles of the righteous / but the
Lord delivers the^ out of all. He keeps all their bones / so that not one of
them shall be broken. The Lord deliue reth the souls of his servants / and
all they that put their trust in him / shall not be forsaken. The tyrauntes of
this world may threaten / persecute / empryson / chayn / lock / Not^.

afterward was most miserably slain. The Godly woman Susanne / through false

to be stoned unto death / but God wonderfully delivered her from the hands of
her enemies. Esau burned with an immortal hatred against his brother Jacob /

to kill his brother. But Jacob prayed to the Lord / and so mollifyed Esaus
heart / in so much that when Jacob thought / that both he and his should have
been slain / his brother Esau came gentilly unto him / louingelye embrased him
/ kyssed him friendly / and for very joy wept: so mighty is God to mollefye
tyrauntes hearts / when it pleases him / and to make them gracious and
favorable too his servants. How often read we in the historye of the Gospel
/ that the Jews went about too kill Christ / and yet laid they no hand on
him. The Euangeliste shows the cause / saying: For Joan. 7.
his hour was not yet come. But when the time came that God had appointed

God / let us not fear the worldly tyrau^tes / although never so mighty /
fearce and cruel / which are nothing else but vile flesh / earth / asthes /
duste and dong / whose tyranny is like too a staff of read / whose
imaginacions / counsayles and deuyses are vain / folyshe and of none effect /
when the Lord God take the part against them / and whose glory was the
flower of the field. For they shall do no more against the ellecte and chosen
people of God / than God both suffers and appoynteth. When Pylate sitting in
judgment / said to our savior Christ / knows thou not / that I have power
Joan. 19
to crucifye the / and have power to deliver the? Christ answered / thou
could have no power at all against me / except it were given the from
above. Even so may we say of the worldly tyrauntes: They shall have no power
at all against us / except it be given them from above. And the holy apostles
in their prayer unto God / said / that whatsoever Herod and Pontius Pilate /
with the Gentiles and people of Israel did Act. 4.
against Christ / they did nothing / but that the hand and the counsayl of
God had determined before to be done. No more shall the tyrauntes of this
world do any thing against us / but that / which God before has determined
to be done from everlasting. Of this history of Peter therefore may we learn
two notable things. First that God than most chiefly helps / when things
be brought to greatest extremities. Secondly that the tyrauntes of this world
can not take away a Christen man's life / nor yet do any more against him /
than the good will / pleasure / determinacio^ and appointement off God is / in
whose hand alone / as the wise Eccle. 11
man says / is both prosperity and aduersite / life and death.

The. xij. Chapter.
Seeing / when that we are taught by so many credible histories that God does
at all times help / but chiefly wha^ things be brought unto an extremity /
again that no man can take away the life of any faithful man / till God
apoynteth: let us not doubt / but that God will both hear our prayers / and
help us also / and deliver us / although for a season he seems to differ
his help / and to leave us in the briars. He is the father of mercy / and God
2. Cor. 1. Esa. 39
of all consolacion. His hand is not so shortened / but that he is able too
help / neither is his ear so stopped / but that he both can and will hear
us. God is faytheful / says 1. Cor. 10
the Apostle / which will not suffer you too be tempted above your strength /
but shall in the mids of the temptacion / make a way / that ye may be able
to bear it. Let us not therefore despair / though present help comes not
from God at the first calling / but rather go for the to pray unto God /
after the example of the Cananite / and not to be weary / till we have

good with silence too abide the saving health of the Lord. If we on this
manner behave our selfs toward the Lord our god / we shall without fail
shortly behold the wonderful works of God. We shall se the down fall of
our enemies with all their tyranny / papistrie / Idolatry / supersticion /
ceremonies / masses / decrees / counsaylles / customs / etc. We shall se the
glorious Gospel of our Savior Christ spring again / grow / encreace /
prosper / flourish and tryum phe. We shall se God truly honored / not after the
fond fantasye of men / but according to his blessed will and commandment.
We shall se Antichrist / that son of 2 These. 2
perdicio^ slain with the breath of the Lords mouth / and satan trodden under
our fete. God grant it may be shortly.

Amen.
A brief rehersall of the whole Epistle.
THus have ye heard (most dear brethren) how it came to pass / that the
true re ligio^ of our Savior Christ was taken away from us / and in the stead
thereof / a supersticious and idolatrous kind of worshippyng. God placed among
us unto the great disconforte and unspeakable sorrow of all faithful
Christians. Ye have heard also by what means this plague may be turned away
/ and how the true and sincere doctrine of Christ may be restored unto us.
The cause of Gods wrath toward us / as ye heard / was our ingratitude and
unthankfulness / yea / our synnefull life and wickedness / which was groune up
unto such an heyghte / that God could no longer dissemble the matter / but
must needs take away his blessing from us. We were unthankful for the
heavenly benefyte off his blessed word / yea / we in a manner l^thed and
abhorred his Godly ordinances / even as the ungodly Israelites were weary
N^me. 11
of the celestial Manna / again our life was nothing agreeable to the holy will
of God / but defiled with pride / envy / covetousness fornication / adultery /
swearing / glotonye / dronckennes. With all their kind of wyckednes / unto the
great dishonor of the name of God / which we profess / it therefore could
none otherwise but come too pass / that God should be avenged of these things
/ take away his holy word / and throw us again into the deuelishe darkness
of the papishe Egipte. For as he fylleth Luc. 1.
the hungry with good things: so sends he the rich emptye away. And as our
Sa Math. 5
uioure Christ pronouncheth them blessed / which hunger and thyrste / after
righteous nes / and promises that all such shall be satisfied and have their
desire / even so are they cursed / which have no delighte in the word of God
/ and from such shall the bles singe of Christ's Gospel be taken away / and the
cursed tradicious of men shall be thrown upon them / as the Psalmographe
says / he would none of the blessing / it shall therefore be taken away from
him. Hereto Psalm. 109.
agrees the saying of our Savior Christ / the kingdom of God shall be taken
from you / and Math. 21.
shall be given to a nation / that brings forth the fruits of it. Again / this
is comdemnation that light is come into the world / and men have loved
darkness more than light. For Joan. 3
their works were euel.

Now to recover the favor of God / and to turn away his heavy displeasure
from us / that he may once again lyghten his glorious and loving countenance
upon us / and bless us with the most blessed benefit of his sons Gospel /
the means / as ye heard / is earnest repentance of our former life / humble
knowledginge of our sins unto God / undoubted faith in the merciful
promises of God the father / setforth unto us / in the most precious blood of
our Savior Christ / diligent invocation and constante calling on the name
of God / for remission of our sins / for mercy / grace / favor / peace /
rest of conscience / etc. Pacient abiding of the Lords leisure / and finally
a continual meditacion and practice of a new life.

If we on this manner return unto the LORD our God / let us not doubt but
that he will shortly turn unto us / mer cifully behold us / and once again
bless us with the heavenly benefyte of his blessed word / that we here on
earth may know his ways / and his saving health among all nations. Turn
unto me / says the LORD of hosts / and I will turn unto you. Zacha. 1.
Remember how favorably God at all times dealte with his people / both when
they were captives in Egipte / and also in Babylon / yea / and at all other
times / wha^soeuer they were in any distress. For though he worthily plagued
them for their wickedness / yet so sone as they unfeignedly returned unto him /
he delivered them from their enemies / and gave them their hearts desire. For
God is never so angry with his people / but that in the mids of his anger /
he will remember his mercy. And though he sometime punishes us / yet will he
be pleased again / if he sees our unfeigned conversion / as Tobie said in his
prayer / Tobi. 3.
After a storm / O Lord / thou make the weather fair and calm. After
weping and heaviness / thou geuest great joy. Thy name O God of Israel / be
praised for ever. Only let us return unto the Lord our God / and become new
men / and without all doubt / we shall se out of hand the mighty working of
God. Repent betymes therefore / repent / humble your selfs in the sight of God /
believe his promyses / call on his holy name / abide patiently his godly
pleasure / become new men in life and conversation / walk worthy your
profession / and so behave your selfs in all things / that God may be
glorified by you. Fare ye well dear Brethren / and according too the
admonicion of the holy Apostle / watch ye / 1. Cor. 16
stand fast in the faith / quyte you like men / and be strong. The Grace
of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Give the glory to GOD alone.
Manne. How long o Lord?

Psalm. 13.
Christ. I come quickly.

Apoc. 22
Manne. Oh / come Lord Jesus.

Prophet. He will come and not tarry.

Abac. 2.

The.C. iij. Psalm / made in English meter / by Thomas Becon, for a
thankesgeuing unto God / immediately after his deliverance out of prison /
whose emprysonmente began the. 16. day of August / the year of our Lord /
15 53. and ended the 22. of March / then next ensuynge.
Psalm. 103.
BE thanckefull o my soul unto the LORD
And all that within me have their being /
Laud / praise and magnifye with one accord
His holy and blessed name above all thing.
O my soul / once again to the I say
Be thankeful unto the Lord ever more /
And look thou forget not night nor day
All his benefits that thou haste in store.
For he it is / yea / he it is alone
Which pardons al thy sins / both more and les /
He delivers the from all grief and moan
And sends the health in time of sykenes.
He saves thy life from destruction
Which otherwise should perish without doubt /
He of mere, 'grace' and tender compassion
Crouneth the with loving kyndnes round about.
He with good things / thy mouth does satisfye
To eat and drink gyuing the abundance /
He makes the joyful / young and lustye
Even as an Egle that is full of pleasaunce.
The LORD does minister justice and judgment
To such as are oppreste with violence /
He defends the good and innocent
But the wicked he casts from his presence.
He showed his ways unto faithful Moses.
And his works to the sons of Israel /
That all his people might know both more and les
In all kind of virtue for to excel.
O the Lord God eue^ of his own nature
Is bent unto gentilnes and mercy /
Yea / friendly is he above all measure
Long suffering and eke of great petye.
For though our sins be both great and many
Yet will not the Lord be always chyding /
Neither will he for ever be angry
But show him self toe us both gentle and loving.
After our sins he deals not with us
Neither according to our wickedness /
But like a father / both gentle and gracious
He forgeueth al our sins / both more and les.
For look how hye is the heaven supernal
In comparison of the earth full low /
So great is his mercy toward them all
That fear hi^ and wickedness away throw.
And look how wide the East is from the West
So far has he set all our sins from us /
Because our conscience should be at rest
And no more trobled with works odious.
Yea / like as a father gentle and tender
Pittieth his own children natural /
Even so is the Lord merciful ever
Unto the^ that fear him both great and small.
For he being our maker knows cer^es
Of what matter we be made and formed /
He remembers / we are but dust and ashes
All of vile and slymye earth created.
A man in his life is like unto grass
His days are few / and but a while endure /
Like the flower of the field away he pass
Flori^ing for a time / but nothing sure.
For as a flour with fears w^d assailed
Fades shortly away and comes to naught /
So does man of cruel death oppressed
Depart hence / and unto nothing is brought.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord
Does continue for ever and ever /
Upon the^ that fear him with one accord
And his justice upon their chylders chylder.
I mean upon such as keep his coucnau^t
And do them selfs diligently apply /
To keep his precepts / and likewise do grant
To frame their whole life accordingly.
In heaven has the Lord a seat prepared
For him self / both glorious and royal /
And his prince like power is so outstretched
That it raygneth and rules over all.
O praise the Lord all ye angels of his
Ye that excel both in strength and virtue /
Ye that do his will without any mys
Ye that harken to his voice / and that ensue.
O praise the Lord our God omnipote^t
All ye his hosts and armies supernall /
Ye servants of his / which always are bent
To do his will / o praise the Lord above all.
Yea / all things that ever God created
Praise ye the Lord that God of might and pour /
But thou o my soul / with heart unfeigned
Look that thou praise the LORD at every hour.
Give the glory to God alone.
Psalm. 112.
O Blessed is the man at each season
That fears the LORD God omnipotent /
For such one has all his delectation
To accomplysh the Lords commau^deme^t.
His sede upon the earth shall be mighty
Flourishing aye like the grene olyue tree /
The generation of the godly
Shall be blessed in every degree.
Such a man in his house shall have always
Of honor and riches great abundaunce /
And his righteousness shall never decay
But in all ages have continuance.
When that other in darkness do remain
Unto the godly pleasant / light shall spyne /
For such one does love mercy to mayntain
To kyndnes and justice / his heart he enclyne.
A good man is bent all unto mercy
And gladly lends to such as have need /
As for his talk he ordreth discretly
So that his words unto virtue do led.
From his place shall he never be moved
But always abide both constante and sure /
The remembrance of the just and true hearted
Shall for ever and ever still endure.
The righteous shall be nothing afraid
Of any euel tidinges / wha^ they be brought /
For his heart on the Lord is wholly stayde
Through strong faith / that God therein has wrought.
Yea / his heart is so thoroughly stablished
That he will not thrynke in no condition /
Untyl he sees his desire satisfied
On his enemies and their destruction.
He disperseth abroad plenteously
And gives to the pore their need to sustain
Remembered therefore continually
Shall he be / and his praise ever remayn.
The ungodly seeing these things / shall ware wood
Gnathe with his teeth / and consume away /
Yet shall the ungodly with all his mood
Shortly come to naught / perish and decay.
Give the glory to GOD alone.
