The life of saint jerome as it is take of lege^da aurea


Saint Jerome came of noble kin: and in his childhode he was sent to rome to
learn. And there he learned Grew latin and Ebrew: And on a tym as he writes him
self to the holy maid Eustace wha^ he studied besyly night and day in bookis
of poetis of holy scryptur: Hit happed so that about mydlent he was smete with
a sodayn and a fervent feuour. In so much that all his body was ded and cold
unto the heart / And when they were besy to dyspose for his buryi^g / Suddenly
he was rauysshed to fore the dom of god / And there he was asked what man he
was and he ansuerd that he was a christian man than said the Judge thou say not
sothe for thou art an hethen man and naught a christian man / For where thy
tresore is there is thy heart And thy heart is more upon worldli books than
upon holy writ / Saint jerome coud not ansuere but oon of the iuges bade beat
him hard / and than he cried and said have mercy upon me and they that stood by
side prayed that he might have foryeuenes for he was but young. And than sait
Ierom swear tofore the judge almyghti god And said lord if ever I have any
seculer or worldly bokis or read upon them her after: than forsake me for a
christian man. and by his oath he was let go And anon he lived again and fond him
self all be wept and his body sore and fulle of wou^des of the betyng that he
suffered before the judge: And fro thens forth he studied and red as besily
upon holy books as he had done tofore upon worldly bookis Than he made him
self a monk and there he lived so holyly chastysi^g the lusts of the flesh
and with sta^dyng the delites of the world that he caused other yt were holy
relygiouse to be the better for his example when he was xxxix year of age he
was made a cardinal pressed in the church of rome And after the pope was deed al
folk cried that jerome was worthy to be pope But for as much as he had used
to blame the flesshelynes of mysgouerned clerkis and religiouse people they with
great indignaco^n lay in a wayt to do him repref: And on a night when saint
jerome should rise to matyns as he was wont: he did upon him a woman's cloth /
and so went in the the church. wening it had be his own: which his enemies
had leyed by his beddis forto make folk wene that he had a woman in his
chamber: and so to scorn him / And when he see their malice he fled thens
and come to constantinnoble and there he comyned with the bishop of holy
scripture and sithen went in to desert and there he suffered great penance and
dissese un year to gydre: wherefore he writes un to the said holy maid Eustace
and seith when I was in deserte in great wyldrenes where is a full horrible
dwelling place all to brent with the son me thought I was among the delices
of rome All my body was deformed and cladde in a sack and my skin made blak
like an ethiope or man of ynde / Every day wepinges / every day waylynges. And
when sleep com upon me uneath I would suffer my ^ere bones to rest upon the
bare earth. of mete and drink I spoke not when they that be sike use there but
cold water. And it seems glotony to ete any thing / soth I was fellow of
scorpyons and of wild bestes / And yet in this cold body and in my deed flessh
I selt brenninges and sturinges of uncleanness: And therefore since they feel such
temptacions that so despise their bodies and fight only with their thoughts:
what suffer the men or wymen that live in delyces sothely as the apostel says
they live in body: but they are ded in soul / But our lord is my wytnes that
after many wepynges / full often times me seemed that I was amongst the
companies of angellis: After he had lived thus in deserte four year he went
ayene in to Bethlem and there offered him self as a wyld best to abide at the
crybbe of our lord and there he gadred many disciples. and founded a monastery
and lived under the reule of thapostelles and v year and an half he trauailled
about translacyon of holy wrytt And unto his end he lived a virgin. also he
wrote the life of holy faders in a book called vitas patru^: he was so wise yt
what man had asked him any question he should anon without tarieng give him
areso^able ansuere / and when there had be never set no certei^ service in holy
church but each body song and redd what he would The emperor prayed the pope
yt he would ordeyne some wise man to set dyuin service / and for the pope knew
well yt saint ierom was perfect and most excellent in latin tongue grew and ebrew
and al wisdom he committed to him yt office and than saint ierom divided the
sauter in to nocturnes and assigned to each day in the wike a proper nocturne
and ordained yt Glia patri should be said at the end of every psalm. He
ordained also pistelles and gospelles for all the year and other things that
long unto dyuyne service and sent them from bethelem un to the pope which he
and his cardynalles received and approved and auctorised forever that wiht
abstyne^ce and labor he wex so weri and feeble that wha^ he lay on his bed he
might not arise but as he pulled vy him self with a rope tied un to abalke for
to go do the service yt longed to be do in the monastery. After thus he made
him self a grave in the mowth of the cave where our lord lay when he was bore:
and thus after he had lived: lxxx year and xviii and vi months he deid and
was buried the yer of our lord ccc xviii: Of the life and passig of this holy
doctor saint jerome saint austine writes un to cirille bishop of ierlm^ in
this wise

O thou worshipfulle priest cyrille
trust thou yt silence is not to be kept from the preising of the priest
jerome yt was most glorious servant of criste^ faith and a corner stone of our
mother holy church in whom it is in manner grounded and made sure / and now
ashynygsterre in heuynli bliss / or else thou drediste yt I should speak of
him as a lisping child or as a man with fowlle lipes: But for heuenes tell
the gloire of god and al yt god made preise him in his deeds should a reso^able
creature be stille for prising while unreasonable creaturis are not stilli /
therefore I shall other speak or be stille if I be stille I shall be bid cry
wiht stones / for sothe I shall speak and naught be stille to preise the high
and worthi jerome for thouh I be vnworthi and insuficient preisere while yt is
no preising fair in the mouth of a sinner yete I shall not sese of this
p^isyng. Thefore our tongue and our hand be made sure and the tongue may not
cleue to our palate: for certe^ly this man is great rigthe holy merueillous and
to be dradde above all yt be about us / Great he is in holiness of his right
excellent life: great in depnesse of his unspeakable wisdom and great in
quantite of his great joy marvelous he is in vnwonte miracles and to be dradde
for the great power yt is yeuen him of god / but how great this glorious jerome
is in holiness of his lif how should one tongue make know wha^ uneath all
to^ges of yt be a live in earth may not suffice to tell his excelle^ce / be
hit therefore leefull to call him another samuel another hely another johan
baptilte dwellid iu deserte and made lene his body with sharpness of meet and
of clothyng but most glorious jerome was not of alas leuyng which as an
hermit dwelling iiii year in deserte had no felaw but wild bestes and
scorpions: and forty year to geder he never dra^ke wine nor sither but fled
them so much yt uneath he would here named: he ete no mete yt came nygh the
fire but only twies in the bitrest need of sykenesse next his flesh he wered
a sack of here and hillid him above with a cloth most vile he knew never
other bed but the earth. ones on the day only after eue^so^ge time he ete fruit
or leaves or herbs or rotes: and after the yeuynge him to praiees he woke till
two ours within night And he sleep upon the ground tylle mydnyght / And
then Anon he rose and tylle day he entenced to Redynges and to holy
Scryptures / He wept fore right small venyall sins / so bytterli yt men
might have wend yt he had slain a man each day thries he beat his flesh with
so hard betynges that ryuers of blood flowid fro his body he eschewid as a
te^peste to speak any evil word Idel was he neu^ but alwey occupied in holy
redyng or writing or techyng of other: what shall I say more if I should sek the
lives of al saints I wene I should find non more holy than he. but for we named
samuelle to fore we may show clearly that he was samuel for from his mother
tetys he was cleped to diverse studies of lecture and set to service of holy
scripture so yt in the light of his chere al be flowed with godly wisdom we se
light of both testamentes and in strenght of his arm a great party of herytikis
is disparpled he is the glory of our virtue translating both the old law and
the new fro the langage ebrew in to latin and in to grew dysposyng both to
abide for ever unto all that com after declari^g many pryueteis and doubts and
arai^g the order of divine service he edyfyed nygh all the church so yt he
appeared great in depnesse of unspeakable wisdom. he coud al liberal sciences so
perfitly that as al men say non apperyth lik him and as I learned my self by
experience of many pystellis of holy writ yt he ^ent to me I found never non
lik unto him for he coud the la^gage and lectres of ebrew: grew: calde. perse:
mede arabike and of al naco^ns as though he had be borne and norsshid among
them what shall I say more never man coud ne know in kind yt jerome coud not but
worshipful fader wene thou not that I sai thise things wenyng yt thou knew not
the life and virtues of jerome but by me: well wot I thy self were his fellow a
long time but I call god to witness that for the holiness of so unspeakable a
man I may not be still though I would for merueilles and miracles knowlech his
holiness and also the self heuenes in which he is great and of mor bliss than
many of the saintis that are therein / No man doubt but that he has oon of the
grettest and the hiest set among the ma^siones of the everlasting fader for
while every man is rewarded there after his life and his merits / and he was of
most perfect lif / Hit shows that he is on of the gretest and the highest
cytezyens of heavenly jerusalem which that yt should more sekerly and plainly be
byleuid to us to fore all men that any age has mind of / He appeared most
merueillous in vnwonte tokens and innumerable miracles of which the worshipful
man Euseby declared some to me by his lettres But of other wonders that be do
there each day merueillously as I here by contynual relacion / I pray the right
dear fader that when thou may have laiser thou woldst gader as many of them
as thou may and sent them unto me that am so desirous to here of so worthi
dedis and so profitable How saint ierom the same hour that he deyed appeired
un to saint austyn

THat the merits of most holy Jerome be not hid I shall tell that be fell
me thorgh gods grace the same day of his passinge for the same day and our yt
the holy jerome did of the cote of filthe and of vnclenesse and was clad with
a clothi^g of joy and of vndedlynesse while I was in my self the^kynge besili
what glory and mirthe was in the blessed souls that joy with criste desiryng
to make there of a short tretis as / I was p^ied / I took pen and Ink to
write a pistell thereof un to most holy jerome yt he should write again to me
what he felt in this matiere / for I know well that in so hard a question I
might not be learned so euydentli as of him of no man a live and when I began
to write that begynnyg of my lettre suddenly an vnspecable light with ameruilous
swetnesse of sweet smell e^trid in to my selle at co^plyne time / and when I sey
hit I was so gretli stoned yt I lost my stre^ght both of heart and body: I
wiste not yet than yt the meruillous hand of god e^hau^sed his servant from
corupcio^ of the bodi and araied him so hie a sete in heaven / but for my eye^
had never sen such a light my smellyng had never felt such a savor I was
greatly a stonyed of so vnherde meruailes. And while I thought my self what it
might be A none there sowned a voice out of the light sayng thise words /

AVstyn Ausyn what sekeste Troweste thou that all the sea shall be put in
alitelle vesselle / Or weneste thou to close all the earth in a little fyste
Or to let the firmament from contynualle menyng / Or to let the sea of yys
wont course / That never man's yeen might see shale thou se Or thynne ere here
that never man's herd weneste thou to mow understande, that neuerman might
understand nor might think what shall be the end of an endeles thing what
shall be the mesure of a thing that may not be mesured / Rather shall all the sea
be spered in a little pytte / Rather shall the earth be hold in alytel fyste:
Rather shall all the sea of ebbyng and flowyng cece than thou should
understand the lest part or portion of the Joys and bliss that blyssed
sowles of heaven have withowt end / bnt if thou were taught by experyence and
tastyng of the same bliss as I am / Therefore trauail thou not to do things
that be inpossyble tylle the end of thy life be come / Seche thou not here the
things that may not be know but of them that be in bliss But rather trauaille
thou to do such dedis that thou may be in posession there of such things as
thou desire to know her: for they that ever enter theder go never again than
I al astoned for dread and withowt strength of heart took to me a little
boldness and seid: who art thou that droppest so sweet words in to my
throat / I am he said Jerome pressed to whom thou haste begone to write apistell
I am his soul that this same our in bethlem leui^g the burdon of the flesh
am Joined un to criste and felawe with al co^panyes of heaven clad in light and
arayied with the stole of vndedeli bliss goo on to the enerlasting bliss in
the kyngedome of heuenes and from hens forth I a bide in no lassing of joy /
but moring wha^ i shall be joined aien to the bodi hit shall be glorified and the
glory yt I have now alone / I shall have then with the body in the day of the
resurecxio^ and we shall be ravished up i^ to the eier to mete with crist austen
not cesi^g au^swerd thou worthiest of men to be thy foteman but have mind on
thy servant though I be most unworthy whom thou louedeste in the world with
so great affecto^n of charity that by thy prayer I may be cleansed of sin by
thy governance I may go without stombelynge in the right way or virtue. by
thy besy defense I may be defended fro my e^mies and by thy holy ledyng I may
come unto the haven of health and now like it the to a^suer me to so^thinges yt
I shall ask the / than laid the soul ask what thou will / knowing yt I shall
ansuer to al thy will / than I said I would wit if the souls yt be in heuyn may
will any thing yt they may not get The soul ansuered / Austin / know thou
one thing yt the souls in that heavenly bliss are made so sure and stable
that there is no will in them but goddis will for they may will goddis will and
fulfille it: non of us is defrauded of our desires aie^st our will for non of us
desires any thing but god and for we have god alwey as we will: our desires ar
al wey fulfilled for we abide perfitely in god and he in us O fader ciril it
were to long to writ in this short pistyl al things that ye glorious soul
a^suerd and made known to me but I hope with goddis help after few years to
com to bethlem to visit his holy relikes and than to declare more openly yt I
herd and have write. if I should spek with the tongues of al men I might in no
wise worthly exp^ss how suddenly how openly and how merueillously yt holy soul
abidinge with me many ours expressid unto me the unity of the holy trynyte and
the trinyte of unite And the generation of the sone of the fader: and the going
forth of the holy ghost from the fader and the sone and the ierarchies and
ordres of angellis and of blissed spirytes and their ministracion and the
blyssed joys of holy souls and other things profitable and hard to man's
understanding and after this the light vanyshed from mine eyes: But the sweet
smelle abode many days after* how merueillous therefore is this man doing so
many merueillys and showing to men so unwont wonders therefore to him cry we and
joy we: And give glory unto his praysyng for certainly he is worthy all
praysynge: and we are not sufficient to praise him for he is entered in to the
house of our lord bright: and most fair where without doubt he has an
everlasting seet a mongest the hiest mansyons of bliss. How four other me^
had a visyon of saint jerome in the our of his death

But for the troth should be declared moo witness than oon I will conferme more
plainly the truth of this thing: A worthy man called Severe excellent in
wisdom and co^nyng with iii other men being the same day and our of the
passing of saint Jerome in the cite of turon saw auision like unto mine of
which the same severe wytnessyth to me for that the hye joy of jerome should
not be hid to the world: lest they yt have delight to follow the steps of
his holiness if they knew not yt he has so great reward they might wax weary
and cesse fro the wey of holiness god would that they should see and know how
many and worthy rewards of holiness he has yeuyn un to him that they should
the more surely draw aster the steps of his virtue for the hope of reward
lassyth the strength of labor: The day of saint ieromes passing at complyn
time: The said severe was in his house and three other good men with him of
which tweyn were monks of saint martyns monastery entendyng to holy redynges
suddenly they herd in heuyn in earth and the air innumerable voices of most
sweet songs vnherde unspeakable: and the soun of organs. Symphans and of
instrumentis of all music with the which as them seemed heuyn and earth and
all things souned in every side: so that with swetnesse of that melodye
their souls were in point to goo out of their bodies. And thus astoned they
looked vy in to the air in to heuyn. and saw all the air and all that is about
the firmamente shine with light brighter than the son out of which com we
swetnesse of all sweet odoure And then they prayed god that they might know
why all this was Than there come a voice out of heaven and said late no
merueille meue you nor thenketh it not merueueillous though ye see and here
such things: for this day king of kings: and lord of lords christ Ihesu
comyth festefully against the soul of glorious ierom in Bethleem going out of
this wicked world to lead him up in to the kingdom of heaven so much the more
excelle^tly and hye tofore other as he shyned to fore other in this world by
merits of more hie and holy living This day the ordres of au^gelles ioyeng and
syngyng with such voices as ye here come with their lord. This day all the
companyes of patriarkis and prophetis. This day all holy martyrs / This day al
confessors / and this day the glorious and most blessed virgin marie mother of
god with all holy virgins above heaven and the souls of all that be in blis
come joyfully and festefully against the contre man their cytezin and heir of
heuyn with them This things said the voice was still but the light odor and
song abode an our after and so cessyd: By this things here is it showed that
he is one of the highest cytezyenes of heavenly iherusale^ and no man doubt
but that as his will is more nere to goddis will. so he may get there what he
will rather tha^ other How saint Johan baptiste and seint jerome appeyred to
saint austyn in a vysion

NO man think that I am so hold to say that saint jerome is better than saint
johan baptiste: for as our savior berith witness noone is more than he ne
that jerome is in the bliss of heuyn to fore peter and paul and other
appostols that were specially chose and hallowed of Christ him self yet though
resone forbid to sey that Jerome should have more glory in heuyn than they I
see no reason why hit should not be lefull to say that jerome is in heuyn
blyssed with them while he is not discording fro them in holiness And since
god is not acceptor of persons but he discerns the merits of each person he
yeueth to each as they deserve / if it seem that jerome should have less joy
than johan baptiste and other aposteles: yet the merits of his holiness the
greues of his labors the bokis of his writing the translacion of both laws /
The ordinance of divine service the frutis and profitis of goodness that he
did not only to all that be now but also to them that be to comen seem to
preue that jerome is even like to them in bliss / But lest that I make a
suaar of scorni^ge to some that would deem that for carnalle affection where
through a man may lightly err from troth or for vnco^nyng of my self: I
lykened glorious jerome to saint johan baptiste. or other apostoles I clepe god
to witness that I shall tell a thing that I learned never of man: but by the
reuelacion of almighty god that hiheth and magnifieth his chosen. the fourth
night after his passing when I thought desirously upon the praysinges of most
blessed jerome and began to wryt a pistelle thereof unto the about midnight
when the sleep came upon me there befille me a meruerueillous visyon there come
vn^to me a great multitude of aungellis and among them were tweyne men without
comparison brighter than the son: so lyche that there seemed no difference safe
the one bare three crowns of gold set full of precious stones on his head.
And the other but tweyne both they were cladde with mantels most white and
fair all woue with gold and precious stones They were so fair that no man may
imagyne it. They both com nere unto me and stood still in scylence wha^ he that
had iii crowns seyde un to me these words Austyn thou thynkest what of
troth thou sholdest say of Jerome. And after long thynkyng thou wyste never
Therefore we be come both un to the to tell the bliss / Sothely this my
fellaw whom thou seese / is Jerome / which is even to me In all wise in
gloire as he was even to me In leuyng: that I may he may: that I will he will
/ And as I se god so sees he god / knows god and understands god in whom
is all blessidnesse of saynetes None saint has more or less bliss than
other but in asmoche as oon has more clear contemplacyon and sight than other
of the fayrenesse of god / That crown that I bear more than he is the aurealle
of martyrdom by which I ended my bodyly life: For thaughe Jerome for the
traueylles and disseses penaunces and affl^ccyons words and repreues and other
grievous things which he sufred Ioifully for christ And so being a verray
martyr has not the reward of martyrdom: yet he ended not his life by the
sword he has not the aurealle that is given in toke^ of martrydome: The other
crowns that both he and I / have are the aureall that are dew only to virgins
and doctors by which they are know from other. Than Aunsuerd and said who art
thou my lord / he said I am Johan Baptiste that am come down to teache the of
the gloyre of Saint Jerome that thou tell it to other people for know thou yt
wourshipe that is to do to any saint. is do to all saints for there is
none envy there as is in the world where each man seeks rather to be above
than to be under: Not so In heaven but there each sawle is all glad of others
Joy and bliss as if he had it him self / wherefore the Joy of each is the
Joy of all / And the Joy of all is the Joy of each / when these things
were said that blessed company went there ways / And I awoke of that sweet
sleep / and felt in me so great fervor and brennyng of love and and charity
that I felt never so much to fore: And from thens forth was there none
appetyte in me of envy or of pride as was to fore / God is my witness that
there is so much feruor of charity in me that I Joy more of another good
than of mine / i desire more to be under than a boue any / I sey not this for
to get me vain praisyng / But for no man should wene that these were vain
dremes where by we are often scornyd / but a true vysyon by which we are other
while taught of god preyse we therefore god and his saynctes / Preyse we most
holly jerome that did great things in his life / and has received great
things in his death. Man owht not be sleuthfull to peryse him whom god has
manyfyed Nor wene to manne to do wrong to sayinct Johan and to the appostles

their glory. Therefore thou that worshipeste saynct Johan and the Appostles
wurship also saint Jerome / For he is even un to them in all things sykyrly
therefore with out dred knowleche we with devotion that Jerome is even un to
Johan: For if we sey he is less than Johan / we do derogacyon un to Johan:
This tretys of praisyng of jerome I said un to the Fader Cirylle prayng that
thou scorned not my little wit / Since that thou wylt read this praysynges yt I
have seid of charity / if all tongues of all men should praise him they ware
not suffycient wurshipfulle fader have mind on me sinner when thou stondest on

Here endith the pystyl of saynct Austin un to cirille

and here begins the pistel of the same cyrille bysshope of Jerusalem un to
saint Austyn of the Miracles of saint Jerome And first how three deed men
where areised and an heresye destroyed by saint Jerome /
TO the worshipful man worthiest of bisshoppes Austin Bisshoppe of ypon Cirille
Bisshoppe of Jerusalem lowest of all Prestes Sendyth gretyng
And to follow his steps whose holiness cessith not to shine In earth yt is
to say of glorious Jerome whose mind is had everlasting: And how worthy he is
thou woste well thy self for th^w use right myche his spekyng and doctryn /
But I to speak of him since I am in all wise wicked and unworthy I hold it to
much boldenes But yette for thy charity compels me to write to the sum
meruellous myra^les that god list to do by him in our days to show him
glorious to the world. And to all folk trustyng in thy prayers I took it on
hand and shortly I shall tell few of many / And first I begin at one holy
man Eusebye discyple of the same Jerome / after the death of most gloyrious
Jerome there rose an heresye Amongst the Grekys which come to us that be of
lati^ tongue which heresye labored to preue by wicked resons that all saved
saules should not comme to the sight and knowliche of god in which is all
bliss tylle that day of dome: when they shul be Joined ageyn to the body / And
also that dampened saules should have no pain tylle that day / their reason was
this For like as the saul with the body had do well or yuelle* so with the
body it should receive mede or pain They seide also that there was no place of
purgatory where souls that had not do fulle penance for their sins should
be purged / And wha^ this wicked sect encresid we were sorry yt us yrked to
live any leuger than I gadred to gyder all our bishops and and enioned
them fastings and prayers that the power of god should not suffer his faith so
to be troubled A merueylous thing and in happes not seyn to fore three days of
fasting and prayers fulfilled glorious Jerome Apperynge on the night
followynge to his dear sone Euseby to forseid in his prayers and with benygne
speech comforted him and said dread the not of this wicked sect for hit shall
sone have an end then euseby looked on him and he shone with so much
brightness that no man's eye might look upon him but weeping for joy euseby
might uneath speak but as he might he cried And said thou art my fader Jerome
and often rehersyng these same words he said fader why for sakest me why
despised thou my company Certain I shall hold the And not leave the nor thou
shall not goo without thy sone he said / I shall not leave the be comforted
for the xx day after thowe shall follow me. And be with me in joy without
end: But say to Cirille and to his brethern that they all And to all Clerks
that be men of true crystyn feyth and also all that be of the tothere sect
come the morrow to geder to the church of our lord where my body lies / And
make thou the bodies of three men that are this nyht deed / in the cite to be
brought un to the place where my body is huryed And thou shall ley upon them
that sack that I vsyd to were and anon they shall arise And groundely dystroye
this beresye / Than glorious Jerome bade him fare well and apperyd no longer on
the morrow worshipful fader Euseby came un to me that was than at bethlem and
told me all that he had seyn / And I doing thank to god and to glorious
jerome did bring the three deed bodies to us all gaderyd to geder in the
place where our savior was borne of the clean vyrgyne marie where also lies
the body buried of glorious Jerome / O meruellous mercy In how many worshyppes
can he enhaunce his saynctes / In this time men of evil sect scorned men of
right believe / But beth glad all men of Right faith and prayseth god in
voice of Ioyenge / For ye have received mercy in mids of his temple / The
worshipfulle man Euseby come to the bodies of each one of these deed bodies of
men and knelyng on his kneys and holdyng up his hands to heaven he prayed all
men heryng / And said God to whom no thing is Inpossible no thing grievous
that do great merueilous alone and dispisest none that hops in the Send to
us virtue of thy grace and strength and here the prayers of thy trwe servants
And that the faith that thou haste give mote a bde vndefowlyd / And that the
Error of the other may Appear by merytes and prayers of the glorious loved
Jerome bring again un to these bodies the saules that thou haste made go out
thereof / After this prayers he took the sack that Jerome vsyd and towched the
deed bodies there with / And anon they opened her eyes and showing all tokens
of life / verily a roos and be ga^ne with a clear voice to tell openly all
the Ioies of holy saules / And the pains of sinners in purgatory and in hell
/ For as theye told me afterward saint Jerome lad / de them in to paradyse
purgatory and in to hell that they should tell all folk what was do there
/ And after bad them go to there bodies again and do penance for the sins
that they had do / For the same day and our the wurshipfulle Euseby should
dye they should pass also / and if they did well they should have Joy with
him: And so it fylle as I shall tell afterward these things done: The great
multitude of people both of true feyth and this sect: seeing openly there
erroures / and the great merueylles of Jerome yafe great praisyng un to god
that forsakyth not theyme that trust In him: Thus dear Austyn we be taught not
to dread the pursewers of our faith / And to know how ready our pytefull lord
is to help all that call unto him in time of trybulatyon / And how mighty
glorious Jerome is to promote the prayers of them that in clean heart pray and
trust un to him.

Of the merueylous death of the said Euseby and how saynct Jerome Appeared un
to him in the our of his Passing.
When time come yt eusebi knew yt he should pass as he was informed by the
said vysyon of seint jerome the iii day to fore he was myghtyly smite with a
feuere And than he made his bretheen ley him naked on the earth and ley upon
him the sake that Glorious Jerome vsyd to were than he kissed all his brethren
and benyngly confortyng them / he stured hem to abide stauely In their holy
living / He ordained by example of glorious Jerome that he should be buried
naked wythowt the church in which the body of saint Jerome lies / After
this he strengthed him self with the Communyon of the holy body of our lord
Ihesu christ / And commended him to god and saint Jerome And so he lay three
days whithowt bodyly sight or speech. His brethren standing a bout him
contynually saying and redying their sawter the passion of our lord and
othere holy things: But for sithe it is hard and feerfulle to all that live
in this world this that I shall tell / The day that he should deye two
hours to fore the passing of the blessid sawle / worshipfulle euseby by ga^ne
to behave him self so ferfully that the monks that stood about him fell
down to the earth for feer as men out of their mind / For other wyle he
turned up his eyes and wrong his hands to geder / And with a feerfull face
and an hard voice / He sat up and cried I shall not I shall not thou lie
thou lie After thus he fell dowu^ again to the earth and festenyng his face
to the ground as much as he might he cried help me brotheren that I peryshe
not / And they hyerynge this weeping and tremelyng for feer asked / him fader
how is it with you he said se ye not the great multitude of fendes that would
overcome me / They asked him what would they that thou sholdest do: when thou
saydest I shall not I shall not he aunswerd they labor and travail me that
I should blapheme the name of god / And therefore I cry that I should not do
it / And they asked him why fader had thou thy face down to the earth. He
answered that I should not seye here lokynges which be so foul and so
hory^ble that the pains of the world are right naught In regard thereof /
Among these words he began to do and cry again as he did to fore / And so
came to the last end of his lyffe his bretheen that stood about him / For
fere and sorrow fell down as deed not wetyng what they might do: god that is
glorious in his saynctes marvelous In mageste benygne and mercyfulle to them
that dread him he forsakes not his servants In time of need / For when
worshypfulle fader Euseby came un to the last, end: Glorious Jerome apperyd
and benynely comforted him and when he came all yt Innumerable company of
fendes for feer of him vanysshed away as smoke as many of the monks bear
witness / that by dyspensacyon of god saw it / But all that stood about
herd how Euseby said / From whens come thou fader why have thou tarried so
long / I pray the for sake not thy sone And suddenly all they herd how
jerome ansuerd again / Abide sone be not a ferde for I shall not for sake the
whom I love so much: then afterward alytle while wurshipfull Euseby dyed / And
the same our died the three men that were arerid and as I hope went with Euseby
un to everlasting Joy for all the: xx. days after they were arerid they give
them to so much penance that without doubt they where worthy to be rewarded
with endlese bliss /

How the said three men after they were Areryd told Cirille of the / viii /
pains of purgatory and of hell /
I Trow it be not to keep silence of the things that I learned of the three men
in the days that they lived after they were arerid for all the time I was
contynually with sum of them from mydmorow tille euensong time desyryng to
know the pryuetes of the life / that we abide after this short and passing life
But though I learned many things of them yte now by cause of shortness I may
tell but afew / On a time when it happened me go to one of them I fond him
sore weeping And after I felt he would take no confort by my words I asked him
the cause of his weeping And when I had askid him oftyn / And he answered not
at the last compellyd be long instaunce / He Answered and said if thou knew
the things that I had by experyence of the last day there shuolde none be
but in cause of wepinges than said I y pray the tell me what thou seyeste he
was stylle alytle while and than he said O what pain and tourmentes are
ordained not only to dampened souls but also to them that be in purgatory
Than said I of thing that I know not / I can give no certain sentence / But I
trow they be not like to the pains and deseses that we suffer here / he
ansuerde if all the peynes tourmentes and afflycions that might be thought
in this world were lykned to the least pain that is there All that seems
there pain and tourmente should be but soulas and comfort for if any man a
live knew the pains by experyence he should rather chese to be tormented un to
the end of the world without remedy with all the pains to geder that all
men suffered from Adam tylle now than be tourmented a day in hell or in
purgatoyre with the least pain that is there And thetfore if thou ask me the
cause of my great weeping it is for dread of pains that are ryghtfully give un
to sinners for I know well that I have sinned ayenste god And I dowte not but
that he is ryghtwis And therefore merueylle not though I sorrow / But rather
thou oweste to be greatly merueylled why men that wot well they shall dye At
the leeste by experyence / of other live here in great sikyrnesse and think
not how escape so great pains / At these words I was so touched with inward
sorrow so that uneath I might speak and I said Allas what is this that I
here: But I pray: the tell me what difference is there be twyxe the pains of
hell and of purgatore he said there is no difference in gretnesse of pains
but in o wise there may be difference for the pains of hell abides no end
but monyng at the day of dome when the bodies shall be tormented with the sowles
and the pain of purgatoire has an end: for after they have do her penance
there / they shall be take un to endlenes Joy I asked be they that are in
purgatoure tourmented all I lich or ellis diversely he said dyuersly sum more
grievously and so^me more eisely: After the quantite of the sins for in heaven
all blessid sawles be hold the face of god wherein is all bliss and though
each of them have asmoche Joy as they can will or think: yette they be not
all eueyn in Joy for some has more and some has less after there deeds
that they have dso / And if thou merueyle that there may be diverse Joys in
saynctes while the only cause of their joys is god him self in whom may be no
dyuersite: The answer is this that the knowing of holding and understanding
of god is all the reward and joy of sai^tes and therefore though al souls in
blyse and know god as he is yet so^ se and vndesta^d lases tha^ other:and so
have lase joy and so^me so and vndiysta^d him clerly than other and so have
more Joy So it may be sa^de of the pains of dapned souls For though all
dapned saules be in one place of pains ytt they are tourmented with diverse
pains after the qualyte of the sins for there is so myche dyfference be twyx
the pains of crsten men and hetheen men that the pains of hethen men in
regard of the that false christian men suffer be as it were no pain And there be
unspeakable and may not be thought of any that lives in earth and so it is
worthy / For christian men receive the grace of god in vayn and would not be
amended of their sins while they lyuid holy scripture cryeng upon them
c^tynuall and they set not there bye / I said it is right horyble that thou
seyst / And would god hit were bysylly festned in the minds of all that be
alive that they might sece from sin for dread of pain / if they would not for
love of Joy

Of the deyng of these three men* a reryd and how Saint Jerome conforted them
in there passing /
NOw I pray the tell me how it was with the the last day when thy saul
passid from thy body / he seid when the our of my death came there came so
great multitude of euylle spyrites and ee^des in the place there I lay yt for
multitude they might not be no^bred the lykenes of them was such yt there may
not thing by thout more paynefull nor me / re horyble for any man of live would
Rather put him self to brenne in hottest flames of fire than ye would see the
forms of them in twynkelyng of on eye. These fendes came un to me and brought
un to my mind all the sins that ever I did sturyng me to trust no longer
in the mercy of god for I might not escape nor wythstande them to assente un
to them / Glorious Jerome came with a / great company of Aungelles about him
seuyn times brighter than the son and confortid me: And wha^ he saw the
wicked spirits how hard they troubeled me he was greatly sturid ayenste them
and said with a feerfule voice ye spyrites of wickedness and of all
cursidnesse. whi come ye heder wot ye not well that he thus should be socored by
my helps leueth him anon. and with draw this wickedness from him as far
as the Este is from the weste / and anon with these words all that company
of cursid spirits was aferde: And with great crienges and waylynges they went
out of the place there I lay And tht glorious Jerome bade some of the angels
that they should not go from me but abide tylle he come again. And with the
other angels in haste he went his ways and wha^ he was gone: the Angels
that he left to keep me: Bigyne to conforte me and behotyng me fair / if I
would suffer and abide with strong heart / and these words of conforte an
our paste / And than came saint Jerome again / And sta^dyng in the door he
said com in haste / Then suddenly my soulle left the body so grievously And
birterlly that no man's mind might vndirstande what anguysshe and disseeses
these were: But if he lernyd them by experience as I have: For if the
vndyrstandyng of all men should resceyue all anguysshes and sorrows that they
cowde they shnlde co^pte them at naught in regard of the departing of the
saul from the bodi But while he told me this and many mo things fulle hard
and dredefulle to all men which I write not her for length. the day biganne
to end and therefore he must nedis leave to tell the things that by fylle him
after his death which I desired most to here /

How the saules of the iii men stood to fore the dome of god and how saint
Jerome hade them to se the ioies of heaven the pain of purgatory and of hell
and since bade them go again to there bodies
^He next day after I clepid the other tweyne with hrm to wete how they acordid
that by witness of them all three I might be taught the more surely And when
they began to tell me yt / that the other had cold me to fore I seide though
these things be profitable / yet it is not vein to speak them often yet
leuyng this that I have herd / I pray you tell it forth what by fyl you
after ye were departed from the body than seid he that spacke on the day to
fore / what ask thou cyrille it is not possible to tell it fully for
spirituell things may not be co^prehendid in our wit thou know that thou
have asoule / and yette what a (...) is thou know not / Also thou know
that god is but what he is thou may not know in this lyffe but by example So
it is of Angels and of all vnbodely things for which there is many things
know in kind that for our little understanding we may not understand heavenly
and spyrtuel things that been in all wise strange from / the knowing of kind
/ Than I seyde it is as thou say But I pray the tell as thou may: than he
seid / as these men that been hyer with me shall here witness that had
experyence of the same things as well as I* so shall I tells as I may when my
soul was dyssoluyd from the body with so mauy anguysshes and sorrow as I said
to fore / suddenly and unspekably in twynkelyng of an eye hit was bore to fore
the presence of god demyng / But how or of whom it was boore I know not / and
it is no meyrueyle for now I am in the heavy body and then was the sawle
wythowt body of flesh / There to fore the Judge god were the sawles of ryghtwys
men tremelyng with vnthenkable feere what the Judge should do: Allas why know
not they that be dedly to whom shall befalle as then befulle us Certain / were
not the unknowing there of: They should not sin in all the time of our life
/ that might be hid from the Judge / but all that ever we did was as clerli
know to all that stood theere as if they had be present / In so myche that the least of all thoughts yt ever we thought appears there as it was By thenke
that with great feeres we were smite with all at that time / there stood many
fendes beryng witness of all the euylles that we had do declaryng the time
the place and the manner / And we our. self might not sey nay to that / that
was put upon us both for each of us knew well that it was true / and also
that the Judge knew all things and was most ryghtfull: Allas allas what shall
I sey what sentence abode we than / for mind thereof I quake yet I am aferde
Our wyckydnesse cried after vengeance un to the Judge And uneath appeared
there any good whereby we might have hope of mercy / and all that were there
cried that we were worthy to be in torment and pain And when there failed no
thing but only to give the sentence against us that is give against sinners
Glorious Jerome that is bryghter than all the sterrys with sayncte Johan
Baptyste And with peter prince of the appostles and with a great multitude of
angels come un to the trone of the Judge and prayed that our sentence might be
tarytd a while / And that we might be give to him for the reverence of devotion
that we had to him and for need to destroy the said heresy And as he would so
it was granted to him After this he with his blessed company led us with him
and declared to us where all christian souls have everlasting Joy that may not
be spoke that we should bear witness the And then he had us to purgatory
and to hell And not oonlie he showed us what was there / But he would also we
should assaye the pains by experience / And when all this was do that time
that wurshipfull Euseby touched our bodies with Ieromes sack The same glorous
serome bad us turn again to our bodies And that we should bear witness of all
that we had seen and behotyng us that if we did dew penance for our sins
we should on the / xx / day after have endless bliss with worshipful euseby
yt should depart from this world the same time and so were our souls joined
aye^ to our bodies / O dear austyn many things learned I of the three men which
if they were Impressed to menis mind they should vtterli leave a way from them
the love of all etherly things and the great bisynes that is had there
about / that make many a man to err / But for I bide thy coming to visyte
the relyques of glorious jerome: as thy lettres make mind / I leave of now and
will touch of the sepulture of wurshipfull euseby. And sithe speak forth of
the glorious miracles of saint Jerome:

Of tweyne miracles that euseby wrought Or his body were buried:
When this holy man was deed a boute mydmorowe a non there showed many miracles
to bear witness of the holiness of his life of which I will tell tweyne /
there was a monk of the same abbey that for wakyng and for weeping, had lost
his sight and a none as he touched the wurshipfull bodi of euseby he had his
sight a yen as he had to fore / Another man there was that had a fend with ynne
him and was out of his wit and come and met with us as we bear the bodi of
holy eusebi and a none he was delivered and made hole. think we here meueyle
how holy this man was in his lif yt might do so great miracles so hastly after
his end: think we on his holiness with great dread for since that he yt was
so holy had so perilous a trouble and te^ptacyo^ at his e^de how shall we sinful
wretchis escape yt hour and we wot not how sone we shall come thereto* tha^ we
buried the bodi of eusebi with worship but naked as his master was by the
church in the which jerome was buried and in the cherche yerd of the same
church the bodies were buried of the said three me^ yt died the same hour

How an heretic called Sabynyan was mtruelously heded and overcome by might
of jerome

There was an heretic called sabynyan that said there were two wills ni christ
so^me time varying In so much yt he said crist would many things that he might
not do. and with this heresy he did us so much sorrow that I may not tell
it with my words / For he perverted the folk that Is committed un to us: As
a Rauysshyng wolf / And for he should maynteyn his heresye the more effectuelly
he made a tretyce thereof / And said that glorious Jerome had made it to make us
give faith there to. But I know well jerome made apistell against the same error
a little before he died And therefore I cleped the same heritike on a sunday with
all his disciples in to the church of Jerusalem to dispute and preue his
error There was gadred also the same time all the bysshopes and many other true
cirsten men And so our disputacyon from none endurid to even And when the said
herytyke aledged against us the said tretice that he fadred upon glorious Jerome
Siluayn archebysshop of nazareth might not suffer so much wrong to be put on
saynct jerome for he loved and wourshiped saint Jerome with so much
affectyon and devotion of heart that at the beginning of any thing that he deed
he asked help first of god and of glorious Jerome / And therefore he was called
jerome ny of all folk: he a roos against the heretic and blamed him sharply
for the wickedness that he did / And when they had long stryued and each of
them said against other what they might at the last they acorded to geder
thus / That if saynct Jerome showed by the second day at none that he had
falslye made that tretyce the herytikes heed should be smyten of And else should
siluayns the Archebysshp of nazareth / And thus each man went home and all
that night we yaue us to prayers Askyng help of god that fails non that
trusts in him But he is great and right preysible and there is none nombre of
his wisdom wha^ the our came on the next dai the heretik with his dyscyples
came and went in to the church rennynge about as a lion sekyng to devour the
servant of trist and all the people of true feith stood in the cherche
clepyng the name of saint Jerome But the glorious jerome fared as thaugh he
had slepte and took no head to thayre prayers / And I all be wept stood
estonyed and merueylled whi glorious Jerome a bode so long / and when there
appeared no thing of miracle the heretyke crwelly cried upon Syluan to do that
he had be highte the holy Syluan came unto the place where he should by be heded
Ioyng as though he had goon to ward a feste / And all other bysshopes that
stood there weeping he conforted and said Ioyeth with me my dear friends Ioieth
and be not heavy for god leueth not them that hope in him than he kneled a
down and said most holy Jerome help me if it plese the / And though I be
worthy much more tourment than this is / yet leest fallnesse hane place / do
ye socours to truth / And if it be not lefull that I be help be merciful
unto me at mine hour of my death that I be not departed from endless bliss /
And then he held forth his neck and bade the tourmentour smite and the left
up his swerd on high desiryng to smite of the bisshopes head at oon strok than
suddenly al me^ sey^g come glorious Jerome and put up his hand and held still
the sword and bade Syluan a rise / and then he blasfemed the heretyke /
Showing how he had untruly made that tretyce and understand that scripture and
therefore he thretened him and vanyshed from the sight of all people / And
anon as Glorious Jerome was a goo. the heretykes head fylle upon the ground
smytte of from the body as though it had be smytte of with aswerd at a strokt
/ And when they all saw this great merueylle: Suddenly they were astonyed /
and thanked god / and the dysciples of the heretykes turned to the way of
trougth: Loo how the trust of this Bysshope Syluan was effectuellie in god and
glorious Jerome for he dred not to die for through yeuynge example to all
christian men for he is no cyrsten man that spares to dye for trougth Since
christ yaue his life for us to bye us from all thraldom we owe not to be aferde
to give our life for him when time is for no man may get the crown of
bliss without he fight lawfully for it:

How the fend appeyed in likeness of the said Archebysshop Syluan and
disclaundered him meruylouly and how he was delivered by glorious Saynct Jerome
FOr I have said sumwhat of Syluayn I will sey a another thing of him als
merueyllous as the furst whereof be as many witness as there be folk dwelling
in the Cite of Nazareth and of Bethe^lem they saw it with thayre eyes / The
old serpent the fend that for his pride was cast down in to hell having
envy at this wourshypfull Bysshope Syluayn grievously he was sturred against
him / and gylefully he trauaylled to sclander him: that as many as by ensample
of his holiness had encreced in the ways of holy conuersacyon so by his
fall that they be sturred to euelle / On a night he took his likeness of the
said holy man / And appeared unto awurshypfulle and a great woman lyynge in her
bed / And besyed him to come unto her vnlefully / Asking the concente of
hure body / than the woman not knowing the man was aferde / And seeing her
self alone in hure chamber with a man wyste not what to do / But cried loud
and often So that with her busy creyng they awoke that were a sleep not oonly
in the same house. But also her neighbors about her / And all they ca^me
rennyng to her chamber and asked her what her eyeld and she being sore aferd
told them / But in the mean time that gylefull serpente hid him under her
bed / And they sought a boute long to wit what man it was / and at the
last they found him wiith many candelles light that went verylly it had be
Syluayn the Arshebysshop and then they stood astonyed and in their manner out
of there wits nor wyttynge what to say nor do: seeing both his holiness
and that foull abomynable deed / At the last they asked him why he had do
such wickedness And he answered what did I amysse though this woman cleped
me to do this / the woman herynge with wepi^ge answered that he said untrue
then he wyllyng to stir men more a yenst the servant of god to make them
sclaunder him the rather / He byga^ to speak so foul and horrible word is of
uncleaness / That no man might suffer theyme for foulness: But with despite
and great repreues they compelled him and made him goo out of the house and on
the morrow they told about what was do / And cried that Syluayn the
archebisshop was an Ipocryte / And worthy to be brent In somoche that all
nazareth was sturred against him that they might not here his name but if they
cursed him a meruylous patience of this man a token of great holiness wha^ he
herd all this sclaundre and reprefe he moved not onys his mouth to speak any
evil word nor his heart was nothing sturred to vnpacience: but alwais he
thanked god and said his sins had deserved it Alas Augustyn what shall I say
not oonly I flee as much as I may wrong and repreues / but often I am grieved
with a few words I desire reward of heaven But I take no keep to trauayll
therefore and yet I wot well there can no man come there / But by the way of
trauayles and of affliccyon and desseses / And what shall I else deem while I
find my self discordyng from holy men in my life and manners / But I must be
found discordyng from them in my death / And in reward it is fulle grievous
and heavy to me: to think on holy me^nes life: and on mine it is merueylous to
here how men speak and read of holy me^nes deeds as I do / and will nothing
do as they deed / This I say to show mine own folly I know well that I have
often herd of the same syluayns mouth yt he thought him self never so well at
ease / as when he saw him dyspised and trod down of all folk / But this
sclaundre of him grew so far that it went in to alyzau^dre and Cypre and
othere lands and Cytees somoche that there durst no man comme within his door
Merueylous god syttyng a boue and seeing all folk / He suffered his servants
to fall in trybulacyons and desseses for their better / But he fails not
them when need is / After a year was passed that the fend had used such
malice a yenst the servant of God the holy Bishop the same Bishop left all
other things and went pryuely in to the Church where the body of saynct
jerome was buried as to an haven of refuge / And there at his tomb he set him
to pray and after he. had beden there two hours in his pariers there come a
man in to the cherche full of the speryte of malice / And fyndyng the Holy man
there prayng he ran unto him as a dragon and repreued him sayng that he
labored contynualy to stir womennes hertes to unlawful lusts / But the
Innocent lamb Siluayn Ioynge of his of his own despite answered not. Than he
with his right hand drow out his sword that he bare by his side and lift up it
to have put it into Syluans throat / And when this wurshipfull Bishop Syluan
put against him this word help Glorious Jerome this man turned his own throat
and so slew him self / After it hapened that a another wicked man came in to
the cherche and wenynge the holy Bishop Syluayn had slain him: He took his
sword to have slain the said Siluan and shortly to tell he killed him self
as the other had do to fore: And uneath was he fall to the ground or that
other two camme in to the cherche and seeing these men deed they wened the holy
man had do it and therefore oon of them that more cruel began to cry and
called him thief. and said how long shall thy malice eudure thou styrrest
women unto thy foul wills and thereto thou sleest men thus preuely Certain
this day shall be an end of thy weekednesse / And a none he ran with his
naked swerd to have slain him / And when Syluan said this word Help glorious
Jerome / this man slow him self as the other had do to fore with his own
hand / The the other man that came with him seeing this was aferd and ran out of
the door and cried out and said come heder all folk and sees this wicked
Syluan that not oonly defoulleth women but also Sleeth men with his wytchetraft
Thanne all the people of men and women came rennynge cryenge that Syluayn the
Arshebysshop was worthy to by brent / And when this came to mine eres I went
weeping thither fulle heuely / and there I saw how a monge cruel wulues stood
that meke lamb Ioyefulle and merry as he had be in great prosperyte: No
thing he said but I suffer this ryghtfully for I have sinned a gaynst my god
all they beat him and pulled him and led him unto tourment / And he was so
much the more glad and the tourment was more grievous / but a none he was lad
out of the cherche door suddenly glorious Jerome was sey Rysyng up out of the
place where he lay / So bright that man's eyes might not well endure to
look upon him / And thus he appeared that all might see him and with his
right hand took Syluayn by the right hand / And with aferefulle voice he badde
them that held him leueth of which voice and vysyon was of so great power
that all that were there were aferde and all the strenght of their bodies
fayllyng fylle down to the earth as dedde men In the mean time a woman bound
hands and fete and fulle of the fend was brought unto the cherche for help
by thandes of many men / And anon as the woman's foot touched the cherche door
the fend be ganne to cry ferefully by her mouth and said / Mercy Mercy
Glorious Jerome said unto him / Thou wicked sperite goo out of this servant
of god and tell the wickedness that thou have do against syluayn showing thy
self in likeness of Syluayn to all folk / when Glorious Saynct Jerome had
beden the fend appear In the likeness of Syluayn / So that all men might
know It it had be Siluan the Archebyshop And there he told all that he had do
to slcaunder the servant of god And loo with great crying the fend vanyshed a
way And thanne glorious Jerome not leuyng the right hand of the bishop said
unto him with a soft voice what desire thou of me my most dear Syluan that
I shall do more for the / He answered my lord my lord he said / That thou leave
me no more longer her / Than said glorious Jerome that thou ask shall be do /
And therefore come thou after me anon / And this said anon he appeared no
longer / But after the space of a short hour / Syluan passed to christ* And
then all the people was astonyed and merueyled / After this the body of this
wurshipfull Syluan was bore in to the cherche of Nazareth with dew wourship
with the multitude of people both of Nazareth and bedlem / And there in the
cherche of Nazareth we buried the body of silan as was semyng / But many words
might not express the wondres of this wourshipfull Bishop for I have more to
say of saynct Jerome I leave of

How hethen me^ yt can to vysyte, Saynct Jerome were Merueylously delivered
from thieves and from death
There were two hethen men rich and good on there manner heri^g of the miracles
of jerome come from aliza^der with much deuocio^ to visit the reliq^s of
glorious Jerome and going in their way if hapened them to err in their
way in to agret wod where they saw no steps of men nor of horses / and
therefore they cleped un to the name of glorious jerome / and committed them to
his keeping in the same wood dwelled a prince of thieves having under him more
than / v: honderd sendyng sum oo way and sum an other way to sle men and
to bring there bodies to him of goodis both This prince seeing these two men he
cleped iii thieves and bad them goo sle them / And when they had taken their
armoure and were nigh them where they saw tofore but two they see an
Innumerable multitude and oon going to fore them so bright that non might look
upon him Than the thieves were aferd and wist not what to do but turned aye^
and when they were far from them they looked a gayn and saw but two and tha^
poursewed them again but as soon as they come nere they saw as they did to fore
then were they more astoned and in all have went to their prince and told him
and he called them, foles and cleped othere xii thieves going him self with
them and they all were aferd they saw but two and wha^ they came nere they
saw as many as they did to fore tha^ they were aferde and all their bodies
trembled and all their strength of their bodies failed and when they came
again to them self they thought to sew aye^ after them pryuelly to see what
should fall when even came these pilgrymes wiste not what to do ne where to be
lodged and therefore they turned to the said xii thieves to ask cou^seell
wenynge to them they be way faryng men. as they were and than they turned to
the thieves ward. They see but two and than they were bold to mete with
them::And after they met the thieves asked whens they were and whider they
would they aunswerd and said we be men of alyzaunder going to Bedlem to vysite
the holy relyques of glorious Jerome The thieves asked what men were they that
come with them / the other meueylled and said we saw none since we come to
the wood save you and other three / than the prince of the thues told them
all: prayng them to tell him what wa^ the cause and they said they knew no
cause: But if it were for they committed them to the keeping of glorious
jerome / than thees thieves enspired suddenly with the holy ghost fill down at
their feet askyng them forgeffenesse and since lad them unto their fellows
at the bigyning of the night they come to the other thieves abydyng after
them and told them as it had befalle praynge them to leave all their sins
and go with them to visyte the body of glorious Jerome / The the other thieves
scorned them and said they would sle them if they spacke any more thereof and
they not cessyng therefore many of the thieves a roos and drowe out there swerdes
but they calling after help of saynct Jerome they might neither left up
their swerdes nor put them up / tylle they whom they would have slain prayed
to glorious Jerome for them / O the unspeakable mercy of our savior that in so
many wise brings whom he will to knowleche of truth / Anon all the
company of thieves seeing this thanked god and glorious jerome and made auow to
vysyte his relyques / Therefore when morrow came more than three honderd thieves
that were there that time left the wod and went with the said men of Alyzander
unto the tomb of glryous jerome telling these wonders there the hethen men
were baptized and leuyng all the vanytes of the world and went in to a
monastery: And the thieves also yaue them to holy living by the grace of god and
by the merytes of Sanict Jerome:

How saint Jerome saved two young men from death that came from rome to visit
him / ^Han tweyn young men going from Rome to wards Bethlem to visit the
relyques of jerusalem hit happened they come by a vyllage xii mile from
co^sta^tyn noble and two mile from the vilaige or they come thereto two me^ were
slain wherefore me^ of the town gadred to geder and began to seek a bout who it
should be that / did yt / and when they had all sought they found none but
only the ii men that came fast by whom they took wenyng they had slain the ii
men* whereof the young men were amerueyled and swore asmoche as they might that
they knew not thereof: but they set not thereby but lad forth the yo^ge men to
their vyllage / And they with rygour of gert tourme^t they were compelled to
knowledge them self gylty where they were not gilty / And so they were damned to
be heded Alas what heart might co^teyne him from weeping to here so many
wayli^ges of Innocents which were arrayed both with yougth and with faryenes
and with noble byrghte for wepi^ges and waillynges and syhynges contynuelly.
They said Jerome is this reward yt thou geuest to them they serve the: is it
that we have deserved with travail of our way Alas thou cite of Rome thou
know of our birthe we went not that thou should have been so unknowing of
our end / thus they were lad to the place where they should be beheded much
people standing there and abidyng / And there they kneled down and held up
there hands and said with a loud voice glorious Jerome maker of our help
and haven of our hope bow thyn eres un to our prayers at this time so that if
we did not this sin: for the which we be punysshed we may feel of thy wont
pity the help of thy delyuerrance and if we be gilty let us be ded as need
asks and when they had said thus they put there necks to the smyters sayng
no thing but help help glorious jerome what merueyle then the help of
glorious ieroeme might not absteigne him from showing of mercy to so many
teres of them that come un to him while the hertes of all that stood about
they of the self tourmentours were meued un to compassion than they lift up
their swerdes and smote on there necks but their necks took the s^^okes as
though It had be a stone and then they smete again and again but they felt
them as they had be smytyn with a straw whereof there aroos great merueyle to
all that stood about: and great multitude came rennyng to see at the last the
Judge that demed come him self and bad them smite again that he might see / And
they smote but their necks would not be hurt then the judge meruayled greatly
and wist not what it might be / But thought that they had used some
whitchecrafte And therefore then he commanded in all have that they should be
made naked and brent / then they made a great fiere a boute them and put
theryn pitche and oil the rather to distroie their lives: but he that
delivered them from sword could also help hem cryeng contynuelly in the
fire: the fire brent fast and the flames assendid up right high but the young
me^ by the help of glorious Jerome rested as in a merry herber / At last the
Judge would know wheder it were by miracles or witchecraft he had they should be
hanged viii days and if they lived so they should goo wheder they would: But
the presence of glorious Jerome failled them not for merneylously he kept
them the viii days holdyng their feet with his hands On the viii day all
the people of the cite and towns and the Judge him self went unto the galowes
and there openli they see this Glorious miracle the kepars tellyng them what
they had seen then all merueyled and praised God and Saint Jerome and did
great wurshyp unto the young men / And than much people went from
constantynnoble un to Bedlem to visyte the relyques of glorious Jerome / And a
non the young men castyng from them all worldly business entered unto the
monastery where glorious Jerome lived both night and day entendyng to prayer
and penance and holy living

How a Monastery of Nonnes was distroied for couetise and Symonye /
THis Miracle of these young men to fore is to us cause of great marvel Joy
and devotion But this that follows yeueth cause of great dread namely to
relygious people in a contre called Thebayde was a monasteri of nonnes right
fair a boute two yer a goo / wheryn were about two hundred ladies honest in
relygion and manners and in contynuelle reclucion / Now each one blessed thayre
eres / that the one let not goo out all that the other takes ynne / for he yt
shall sail in dep see have he never so good a ship and hole it vaileth him not
and if it have one hole in the botome where water may come ynne and drown him
/ why I say this the matter of the story shall show: for the said monasteri
had many virtues and holiness of living but it kept oon sin of symonye that
caused it to be distroyed for by instruccyon of the fend. the Nonnes had this
Ambycion that when any should be received A none a mongest them they took here
not somoche for charity and mercy as they did for money / there might non
enter to a bide in yt monastery but if she brought a certain / so^me of money
with here / In this monastery wa^ a nonne far in Age that had cast from her
the love of all erthly thing and from her childhode ever ente^ded to god in
her prayers and fastings and greatly she hated and lothed this vice that was
amongeste them / To her on a night being in prayers as she was wont Glorious
Jerome appeared in great light And bad her goo on the morrow and tell the
abbess and the other nonnes But if they would cesse of the sin they should
feel the sudden vengaunce of god And when he was a goo she merueiled gretli
what he was that yaue her that charge / And all that night she abode wakyng /
On the morrow she ronge the chapter belle. And when they were all gadered
merueylyng whi they called so hastily this holy lady a roos up a mongest
them and told what she had seen and herd / And a non all the other scorned her
and called her fool. And how she might in happes be drunk over night and
dreme such things But she taking the repreffe defended her with the sheld of
pacyence And sorowyng of thayre obstynacy: But Ioynge of their own dispite
went unto her wont prayers beseching contnuelly that it be fyl not here susters
as she had herd and / x days after she abidyng in this prayer on a night
about mydnighte Jerome appeared unto her and bad her goo without dred and tell
her susteres as she had warned them to fore tha^ the asked what art thou yt
biddeste do these things he said jerome and anon went fro her tyght: But she
knowing of their hardynesse wist not what to do nor say yet at the last she
thought she had lever be hold of them wood and drunk than do against the
will of god: Therefore she did gader her sustres as she did to fore / To have
told them what she saw and herd / But as soon as they saw her a rise or she
began to speak they went out of the chapterhouse with mowes and scorns / The
third night with a great multitude of Angels Saynct Jerome appeared unto this
lady being a sleep / And bad her a rise and goo out of the Monastery that she
were not smyten with sodeyn sentence that should come upon them / but when
she prayed with great weeping that they might be spared saint Jerome bad her
goo unto her abbess in have and to here susters and tell them that but if
they did penance for their sin that same night they should feel the
vengaunce of god: and if they abode stylle obstynat then she to goo and tarry
no longer in that monastery / Than this nonne full of anguysshe and of
heaviness went to the chapter and rong the belle hastily wherewith the abbess a
woke and when she wiste who it was she was wroth and came to the chapter and
blamed her greatly and would here no word of her sai^g and but if she left such
things she should no longer abide in the place with her / that lady answered
tari not to do that thou say for I will no longer abide in this place
saint jerome has appeared unto me and says that this monastery shall be symte
anon with the wreche of god Than the abbess wenyng^ she had said this of
madness bad the kepar drive her out / and when she had been out a while she
took her in again hoping that thereby the would have cesed of such deeds: but
this nonne was glad to goo and full of weeping for the myschef coming to the
place O ferfull god strong and mighty: And who shall withstand him: allas whi
dred we him not to provoke somoche his wreche and may not flee his hands /
but his great dome must needs take them at lest wretches beth a ferd by these
examples here they that trust in their rychisses that stir god unto wrath
with dryness of their couetise what dome god sent from heaven upon this
monasterye tournyng a way their face from him for love of money / uneath was
the nonne goon out at the door but suddenly all the monastery fill don to the
ground sleyng all the nonnes so that there bode not oon a live / But this
lady went unto a Monastery in A contre fast by and there lived in great
holiness: To this miracle I will Join other showing the ferfulle dome of god
that the hard hertes of syners might be turned to the fastenesse of penance
/

How iii. heretics were meruelously punysshed for offense against Saint Jerome
AN herytike of the greeks disputed openly on a sunday with a pressed in the cite
of jerusalem and when the pressed for his defe^se of his parti alleged an
autorite of Jerome to destroy the resons of the greek the greek with a bold
voice was not a shamed to say that Jerome light of all troth lied / and for
he ded such a wickedness with his speech he spoke never word after a another
herytike of the arraians wha^ oon had brought an auctorite of jerome against him
in disputacio^ and heritike had boldli said he lied anon he was smytte with the
vengau^ce of god. for he had not fully ended the word but that all day he
cried mercy glorious jerome for I am tourme^ted of the with hard pains and
wha^ he had cried thus aldaie asmoche as he might at complyn time all men
seeng that were there wrechedly he died / a another herytyke saw in the church
of sion an image of sai^ct jerome and said would god that I had: had the in hand
while thou lyuedest yt I might have slain the with my swerd / and than he
pulled out his knyffe and smote it in the throat of the Image: and how great is
this jerome doing thus many merueiles this heretic smote his knifft myghtly
in the images throat but he might not get out his knyf from his throat nor
his hand from the knyffe tylle it was know openlly / but a noon there came blod
following out at the wound as of a living man which cesse^^ not yet in
showing of the miracle: the same time yt this was do the judge of the contre
was in the church yerd to whom glorious jerome appeared with a knyf in his
throat askyng him to do vengaunce for that ofence tellyng him how that it was
/ The Juge was a stonyed and all that were there and going to the cherche they
see the herityke stand with his knyffe in the throat of the Image / And as soon as they saw it he might take a way his hand than they took him and for
he abode obstynatly in his will and evil sayng yt he sorowed for no thing but
that he had slain jerome in his lyffe / The multitude of the people with speres
and swerdes stones and staves slew him /

How saint jerome delivered a man out of prison from one Land to a another on
a night
Johan mine neue whom thou know arraied with all fairness whom I chose to
me in sted of a sone told the as I wene what befyll him / But yet yt it may be
the better had in mi^de I will write it the lame when was take two year a goo of
men of perse and sold to the officers of the king of percy and for his
fairness he was ordained to serve the king and when he had be a year with great
sorrow and heaviness in the kingis court / the same day twelmouth serui^g the
king at mete he might not for heaviness keep him fro wep^ig and when the king
saw it and had besily asked and knew the cause he had certain knyghtis take
and keep him in a castle in the night following he being there all bewept: in
his sleep Jerome came unto him and as him thought took him by the hand and
bad him come to the cite of jerusalem: on the morrow Johan a woke wenynge him
self he had be among the knights / He found him self in the house were I
duelle / And than he was nigh mad for merueile and could not wit wether he
were in the castelle or in my house: At the last he come to him self and
cried And a woke them that were a sleep / Than they all ca^me rennyng to me
and said Johan was co^me^. yet I was doutfull till I came my self a saw him
present which I went had be in bonds among the persie^s / than he told us how
he was help and than we praised god and glorious Jerome by whoos merits and
prayers our lord deleyuere us from all evil and bring us to the cite of all
