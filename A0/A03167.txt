A Ballad against slander and detraction.
Gar call him down gar call him down gar call him down down a:
God send the faction of all detraction called down and cast away.
AL mighty God
Does shake his Rod
Of iustise, and all those:
That unjustly
Detractyfly
Detract their friends or foes.
He telthe each one
Thou shall judge none
And if thou judge vnbiden:
Thy self says he
Shall judged be
This lesson is not hi den:
To this now sturd
This is concord
Which wilthe us in each dout:
To deem the best
That may be gest
Till time the truth try out.
Knowing by this
That think amiss
Against no man we may:
Much more must we
Ill langage flee
And call it Down down a.
Gar call him down etc.
With sword or skaine
To see Babes slain
abhorth to look upon:
Attend to me
and ye shall see
Murder and slander one.
Like as a knife
By reuing life
so slander fame has slain:
And both ones done
both a like soon
May be undone again.
Then what more ill
with knife to kill
Or with the tung to sting:
with knife or tung
Strike old or yung
both in effect one thing.
These words are short
But they import
Sentence at length to way:
of all which sense
To flee offense
call slander down I say:
Gar call him down etc.
When vice is sought
al vice is naught
But some vice wors then some:
And each man sees
sundry degrees
In each vice self does come.
Now sins the least
We should detest
vice or degree in vice:
If in the most
we show our boste
That shows us most vnwice.
If I in thee
such faults ones see
As no man else does know:
to thee a lone
And other none
these faults I ought to show.
Then of intent
if I invent
Fauls tales and them display:
that is most vile
Which to exile
god calls this down down a.
Gar call him down etc.
Some count no charge
to talk at large
Such il as they do hear:
but Gods account
Does not a mount
to take such talkers here.
Of woork il wrought
when it is sought
In telling forth the same:
though it be true
the talk may brew
Drink of damnable blame.
To frame excuse
of tungs misuse
we have no manner mean:
So that by this
no way there is
Il talles to carry clean.
Which makes me call
Upon you all
as calling call you may:
Tales false or true
me to ensue
To call them down down a.
Gar call him down etc.
Christ cries out still
say good for il
But we say harm for harm:
yea ill for good
Ill tungs do brood
Wrath is in them so warm.
Slander to fere
And to forbere
this text stands well in place:
Woe by the tung
whereby is sprung
Slander in any case.
To sleke this fire
of slanders ire
Repentance must devise:
to set all hands
To quench the brands
with water of our eyes.
Which brand then blow
to make love glowe
That love by grace may stay
and by resort
Of good report
call slander down I say.
Gar call him down etc.
FINIS.
