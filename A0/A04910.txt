The beginning and foundacyon of the holy hospytall / and of the order of the
knights hospytallers of saint Johan baptyst of Jerusalem.
THe true / ancient / and holy hystoryes rehearse and show that the devout
house and holy relygion of ye knights hospytallers of saint Johan baptyst of
Jerusalem took beginning after that Alexandre the great king of Macedony had
conquered the yndes / and that the truth of his death was known in Babylon /
the worthy and valy aunt knights Machabees by their virtuous power put out of
Jerusalem the paynyms and people of strange generacyons: and set the Jews
being dyligent in the service of god in to their fredome and lybertees. And
sith that time the said paynyms made great war against them of Jerusalem. But
fynably when the right noble knight / champyon of knowledge dyuyne / and
vyctoryous tryumphatour Judas Machabeus (that worshypped one god) gloryously
had delivered the said holy cite fro the tyranny of the said enmyes. yet again
he apparayled his army against y^ infydeles: and ordained with all things
necessary in the said cite with great courage assailed / fought / and dyscomfyted
them. In the which battle many of the people of Israhell were slain / hurt
/ and maimed. when he was returned into Jerusalem he considered that it was
devout and merytorious to pray for them yt were slain in battle / did
ordeyne and instytued that in holy places contynuall prayers should be made for
them that so deyed / and also sustenaunce to be given to them that were seek
and impotent.

A certain time after this instytucion the devout prophet and noble knight of
the people of Israhell Ioha^nes Hicarnus founded an hospytall that was named
Xenodoche of such money and treasour as had be taken and found in the tomb
of king Dauyd / with ye which he had delivered the holy cite of Jerusalem fro
the syege yt was laid to it by king Anthyochus named Epyphanes persecutour of
the name of god / that dystroyed the temple of Solomon / the which after was
reedyfyed by the Machabees. In ye which hospytall as follower of Judas
Machabeus he ordained co^tynuall prayers to be said / and the impote^tes /
weyke people / pilgrims / and seek person^s should be devoutly received /
refreshed / and nourysshed.

BY succession of time the edyfycacyon and instytucyon of this said holy
hospytall abode unto ye incarnacyon of our savior and redemptour Ihesu christ /
that howbeit he was rich / for us he made himself poor. Therefore we ought
devoutly to consydre that oftymes with his bodyly presence he vysited ye said
hospytall / there doing many holy works and miracles by his dyuyne goodness.
and that in the said place the holy apostles and dyscyples of Ihesu christ have
done many works of mercy to the people. Certainly it is not to be doubted
seeing that our lord and savior before his passion did magnyfy and gloryfy
many unworthy places in the cite of Jerusalem by his holy works: but that also
of his grace he has illumyned and ennoblysshed the said hospytall of Jerusalem
being a holy place / conforte / and socour of poor and seek people. After the
passion of our savior Ihesu christ by occasyon of sins and iniquytees of the
people of Jews the said holy cite of Jerusalem has suffered great desolacyons
and ruynes in the time of Tytus and Uaspasyan Emperors of Rome that right
vyctoriously took vengeance for the cruel bloodshed of our savior Ihesu
christ. And by diverse ill manners of the cursed paynyms the said holy cite has been polluted and spoiled / and by many nacyons overcome and dystroyed. By these
said dystruccyons and vyolacyons the temple of Solomon restored by the knights
Machabees / and the said hospytall founded by Johan Hycarnus with other holy
places have been desolated / vylypended and wasted / in such wise that the
relygious obseruaunce of the knyghthode and hospytalyte by certain space was
delayde and left. But afterward the said Cite and temple was restored again
by Adryan elius emperor of Rome. For this cause the said Realm of Jerusalem
being destytute and bereued of all fayrnesse and ornaments / having in it
reygnynge people of diverse generacyons and sects / the christian people of all
the world as well of one country as of another went thither in great peril to
vysyte the holy sepulcre / and other holy places. In the which cite yt christian
people Latyns subgecte to the church of Rome had no manner of socour nor
habytacion / and therefore they suffered great outrages / perils / hurtes /
necessytees / pouerte of vytayle and bodyly subgeccyons / beten / domaged /
wounded / sclaundred / iniuryed / and evil entreated of the mysbeleuers there
dwelling, in such wyseth at many deyed in the ways and streets as beestes.
not without spyte of the holy faith. For there was no man that conforted them
/ for the cruelnesse of the inhabytauntes. These causes seen by a devout and
virtuous man of holy living (moved and induced of the holy ghost) named
Guerarde a blyssed pylgrime louy^ge god / and desiring the health of his soul
/ which was comen thither on pilgrimage / considering the submyssyon /
perils and domages of the devout persons that came thither purposed to make
and edyfy a new hospytal / to be ye refuge / socour / and habytacyon of seek /
impotent / and poor pilgrims / to the example of the first Xenodoche / and in
renewynge by imytacion the holy obseruaunce of the noble knights Judas
Machabeus and John Hycarnus. And for the doing thereof he gate license of the
prince that than held the lordeshyp of Jerusalem. Than Guerarde as follower of
the good doings and customs of them abouesayd made and edyfyed a new
hospytall in a place by him chosen nygh to the sepulcre of our lord Ihesu
cryst^ the which hospytal was dedycate to saint John^ baptyst as patron /
because that his fader zachary rested in that place when he came to do
sacryfyce in Jerusalem. when the said hospytall was parfytely fynysshed / and
ordered and arrayed with good customs and works Guerarde as lover of the holy
christian faith gave and yielded himself in to the service of the same / to
mynystre and serve the poor people. and induced his felawes that were come
thither with him ^o do in likewise. And thus they made a holy company and
fraternity together / without making vow of relygion / or chaungynge of their
seculer habyte. But only using meke clothynges they bound themself to the
service of the holy faith catholyke / and to the poor pylgrimes and seek
people. In the which truly all ye works of mercy were dylygently done / the
poor people sustained and ordered / the seek healed / the holy sacraments
mynystred / the pilgrims and desolate defended from enmyes of the faith / and
received conforted / and helped / the^ prisoners redeemed / and al hospytalyte
was celebrate and used. For ye which holy works the said hospytall in short
time was augmented and replenysshed with possessions and lordeshyppes. And thus
by dyligence and labor of Guerarde the co^dycyon and estate of the said
hospytall being accomplysshed and known / the holy syege apostolyke at the
supplycacyon of the said Guerarde took the said Xenodoche in to his proteccyon.
and of the same named him founder / erectour / and defender. And the holy fader
pope Lucius the second defended that none should presume vyolently for ocupy
the gouernynge and mynystracyon of the said hospytall / but that by them that
were admytted in the service of ye said holy order one should be chosen that
should rule over them. And every day many devout pylgrimes induced to the love
and defense of the holy faith put themself in to the service and tuycyon of
the same and with other pilgrims coming to Jerusalem and other holy places
took arms against the enmyes of the faith / and defended them against their
inuasours. And as very folowers of the noble knights Judas Machabeus and
John^ hycarnus ^hey made exercyte to keep ye faith and hospytalyte / and for
ye love of god took arms. when Guerarde had ruled the hospytall y^ space
of.xvi. year he passed out of this present life. And than by electyon of ye
devout persons a man named Raymo^de being of great virtues and merytes was
chosen master of y^ said knyghthode and hospytall. The which Raymonde as wise
and laudable promising / ratyfienge / and approuynge ye holy fader pope
Eugenius the third of that name ordained / and instytuted the rule and habyte
of the knights and hospytallers / which is a white cross with.viii. poyntes^
and a black cloak or mantell. To ye which rule many noble men: as well
clerks as lay people under the said habyte with oath admytted themself. The
said order of knyghthode and hospytal was fulfilled with renown and richesse
under the gouernynge of the said Raymonde first master. specially after the
reduccyon of the holy cite of Jerusalem to christian men. Of the which
entrepryse Godfrey of Boleyne was vyctoryous capytayne. Following the manners of
the said master many of his successors and adherentes have done many great
and worthy feats as it is euydently contained in the hystoryes of the gestes
of Rodes. the which at this time is not of necessyte to rehearse. For it is not
our purpose to write hystoryes. it is suffycient to have showed the beginning
and foundacyon of the said order. But in what manner and in what time the said
knyghthode / hospytalyte / and holy obseruacyon came in to Rodes / and the
succession of the gestes / the Rodyen hystoryes more plainly shows and
declares.

Thus ends the treatise of the beginning and foundacyon of the noble order
of the knights hospytallers of Jerusalem.
Here follows the syege / cruel oppugnacyon / and lamentable taking of the
cite of Rodes.
Willing faithfully to write and reduce in veryte hystoryall the great syege /
cruel oppugnacyon / and pyteous taking of ye noble and renowned cite of Rodes
/ key of crystendome / the hope of many poor christian men with holden in turkey to
save and keep them in their fa^the. The rest and yearly solace of noble
pilgrims of the holy sepulcre of Ihesu christ and other holy places. The refuge
and refresshynge of all christian people having course of marchaundyse in ye
parties of Leuant I promise to all estates that shall se this present book that
I have left nothi^ge for fear of any person nor preferred it for favor. And
first I shall show the occasyons that mo^ued this cruel blodesheder enmye of
our holy christian faith Sultan salyman now being great turk to come with a
great host by see and by land to besyege and assail the space of.vi.
months night and day the noble and mighty cite of Rodes. The year of the
incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu christ M.CCCCC. and / xxii.

The occasyons why the great turk came to besyege the cite of Rodes.
THe first and pryncypall cause was for he did consydre and saw by experye^ce
that there was none other town nor place in Leuant that warred against him nor
kept him in doubt but this poor roch of Rodes. And herynge ye contynuall
complayntes of his subgectes as well of Sury as of Turkey for the domages and
pryses daily done of their bodies and goods by christian men of war received
in to Rodes. And also of ye ships and galees of the relygyon / he took
co^clusyon in himself that if he might put the said town in his power and
subgection yt than he should be peasyble lord of all the parties of Leuant. and
that his subgectes should complain no more to him. The second for he would
follow the doings of his noble predecessors / and to show him self very
heir of the mighty and vyctorious lord Sultan sallym his fader / willing to
put in execucyon the entrepryse by him left the year.M.CCCCC.xxi. The which
sallyn great turk put in all redynesse his army to the nombre of CCC. sails
purposinge for to send them against Rodes / if mortalyte had not happened in
his host / and he afterward by the will of our lord was surprysed and taken
with death. wherefore he being in the latter end of his days / (as some turks
and falls christian men that were at this syege showed me) did charge by his
testament / or caused to charge his sone now being great turk yt after his
death he should make his two first intrepryses And also gane the said great
turk knowledge that all christian pry^ces were besy warrynge each upon other /
and yt he should not doubt but if the rebellyon lasted among them the town
should be his without fail / as it is seen by experye^ce. And for lack of
socours of every part / and specially of such as might easily have helped us
being our neighbors: with their galees and men of war. wherefore it is now
in the hands of the enmyes of the christian faith. The which monycions and
reasons of the false traytre understand and pondred by the great turk and his
council it was considered of them not to lose so good occasyon and time.
wherefore he made extreme dylygence to rygge and apparayle many ships and
vessels of diverse sorts / as galeaces / galees / pallandres / fustes / and
brygantynes to the nombre of.CCC.l. sails and mo. when the prisoner that the
fayd de Merall did send in to Turkey had done his commyssyon he returned in
to Rodes / whereof every man had marvel. And many folks demed ill of his
coming again / as of a thing unaccustomed / but none durst say any thing
seeing the said de Merral of so great autoryte and dygnyte. And he cherys^hed
the said prisoner more than he was wont to do. therefore by semynge he had well
done his message / and had brought good tidings to the dampnable and shameful
mind of the said traytre de Merall.

How the great turk caused the passages to be kept that none should bear
tidings of his host to Rodes.
THe great turk intending with great dyligence to make ready his host both
by see and by land / the better to come to his purpose / and to take ye town
unawarely as he was aduertysed / thought to keep his doings as secretly as he
might. And defended that none of his subgectes should go to Rodes for any manner
thing. And in likewise he took al ye bark^s and brygantynes out of the havens
and ports in those costs because they should give no knowledge of his army.
and al^o made to keep the passages by land that none should pass. Howbeit so
great apparayle of an army could not be long kept close. for the spyres yt the
lord great master had sent in to Turkey brought tidings to ye castle of
saint Peter and to Rodes / of all that was said and done in Turkey.
Nevertheless the said lord gave no great credence to all that was brought
and told. because that many years before the predecessors of the great turk
had made great armies / and always it was said yt they went to Rodes. the
which came to none effect. And it was holden for a mock and a by word in
many places that the turk would g^ assyege Rodes. And for this reason doubt was
had of this last army / and some wend that it should have gone in to Cypres or
to Cataro a lord of the lordshyp of Uenyce. Howbeit the great master not
wyllyn to be taken unawarely / but the mean while as careful and dyligent for
ye wealth of his town / and his people / understanding these tidings of the
turks army / did all his dylygence to repair and strength the town. Among
all other things to build up / and reyse ye bulwark of Auuergne / and made
to cleanse and make deper the dyches. And ye more to cause the work men to
haste them in their business the said lord ouersawe them twyse or thryse every
day.

How the lord great master counceylled with the lords for prouysion for the
town.
THan the said reverend lord thought to furnysshe and store the town with
more vytayles for the sustenau^ce thereof / and for the same many times he spoke
with the lords that had the handlynge and rule of the treasour and of the
expenses thereof in his absence / and sith his coming. That is to wit the
great commaundour Gabryell de po^merolles / lyef^^naunt of the said lord. The
turcoplyer sir John^ Bouthe of the english tongue. And the chau^celer sir
Andrew de Meral / of whom is spoken before of his untruth against his
relygion. The which.iii. lords said yt he should take no thought for it. For
the town was well stored with vytayles for a great while / and that there was
wheet enough till new came in. Notwithstanding it were good to have more or
the syege were laid before the town. and therefore it were behouefull to send
for wheet and other necessaryes in to Ponnant for socoures of the town / and
at that time to puruey for every thing.

Of the prouysyon for vytayles and ordinance of war.
AS touching the store and ordinance of war ye said lords affermed that
there was enough for a year and more whereof ye contrary was found / for it
failed a month or ye cite was yielded. It is of truth yt there was great
store and to have lasted longer than it did. but it was of force to spend
largely at the first coming of the enmyes to keep them fro coming nere / and
fro brynginge earth to the dyches sides as they did. And moreover it is to
consider the great no^bre of the^ / and their power yt was spredde round about
ye town / gyuynge us so many assautes and scarmysshes / in so many places as
they did / and by the space of.vi. hole months day and night assaylynge us
that much ordinance and store was wast^d to wi^hstande ^he^ in all points.
And if it fail idt was no marvel. Howbeit the noble lord great master
purueyed besyly for it / and sent Brygantynes to Lango / to ye castle of saint
Peter / and to the castelles of his isle Feraclous and Lyndo for to bring
powdre and saltpeter for to streng^h ^he town / but it suffised not. And for
to speak of ye purueyaunce of vytayles / it was aduysed by the lord great
master and his.iii. lords that it was time to send some ships for wheet to
places therabout or ye turks host were comen thider. And this to do was
appointed a ship named ye Galyenge / whose capytayne hight Bramboys /
o^he^wyse wolf / of the Almayns tongue an expert man of the sea. the which
made so good dylygence yt wtin a month he did his vyage / and brought good
store of wheet fro Naples and Romany / which did us great comfort.

How a Brygantyne was sent to Ca^dy for wine / and of diverse ships that came
to help the town.
AFter this was moeued for to make prouysion of wine for the town. For ye men
of Candy durst not sail for to bring wy'to Rodes as they were wont to do for
feere of the turks hooste. And also they ofhe town would send no ship in
to Candy ferynge to be taken and enclosed with the said host by the way.
Howbeit some merchants of the town were willing to have auentured themself
in a good ship of the relygyon name the Mary / for to have laden her with
wine in Candy. But they could not agree with ye three lords of the treasour /
and their let was but for a little thing. And all the cause came of the said
traitor de Merall / faynynge the wealth of the treasour. For he intended an
other thing / and brake this good and profitable intrepryse and will of the
said merchants / seeing yt it was noyfull to the turk / whose part the said
traitor held in his deuyllysshe heart. That notwtstandynge the reverent lord
great master yt in all things fro the beginning to the end has always
showed his good will. And with all dylyge^ce and right yt might be requysyte to a
sovereign capytayne and heed of war found other expedyence / and sent a
brygantyne in to Candy / in the which he sent a brother sergeaunt named
Anthony of Bosus a well spryted man and wise / yt by his wisdom wrought so well
yt within a small time he brought.xv. vessels called grypes laden with wine and
with them men of war the which came under shadow of those wynes. Because
the lordshyp of Candy durst let none of their men go to the socour of Rodes
for fear of ye Turk. And beside those.xv. grypes came a good ship whose
captain and owner was a rich yo^ge g^ntylman Uenycian messire John^ anthonio
de Bonaldy / which o^ his good will came with his ship laden with.vii.C. buttes
of wine to socoure the town with his person and folks. whose good and lowabl^
will I leave to think and consider to the reders of this present book. For he
being purposed to have had his wynes to Co^stantynople or (...) was enform^d
of the business of Rodes / and was in the port du Castle in Ca^dy would not
bear his vytayles to the enmyes of the faith / but came out and returned his
way toward Rodes / forgetinge all partyculer profit and advantage. He being
aryued at Rodes dyspa^hed and sold^ his wine / which was a great encreas and
conforte for ^^e town. And when he had so done he presented his person / his
shy^pe / and hi^ folk to the reverent great master / the which retained him
/ and se^ him in wages of the relygion. And during the syege the said (...)
tayne behaved him worthily in his person. And put himself (...) the places as
worthy men ought to be. spending his goods la^^^^ly without demanding any
payment or recompense for his doyge of the relygyon.

How the corn was shorn down half ripe and brought in to the town for fere
of the turks host.
During these things the reverend lord great master sollycityfe and besy
to have every ^hinge n^cessa^y as men and other strengthes / sent vessels
called brygantynes for to cause the wa^ters of the sea to come in to Rodes for
the keeping and fortyfienge of the town. The which at the first sendynge came
and presented their persons and ships to the service of the relygion. After
yt the said lord caused to shere down the rye of his isle / and caus^d it to
be brought in to the town. which was done in Apryll. And tha in May in some
places he made to shere ye wheet half ripe / howbeit the most part was left
in the feldes / because ye turks host was comen out of ye straytes of
Constantynople. And doubting that any nombre of ships should come before to
take the people of ye said isle unawares / the said lord made them to leave
sherynge of wheet / and caused the people of the ferdest part of the isle to
come in to ye town. while yt the great master provided for all things after
ye course of time and tidings y^ he had there aryued a carracke of Gene laden
with spycery from Alexandry / the which passed before the port of Rodes
the.viii. day of Apryll and surged at ancre at the Fosse.vii. or viii. mile fro
the town / for to know and here tydinges of ye turkysshe host. Than ye lord
willing to furnysshe hy^ with people as most behouefull for the town sent a
knight of Prouance named sir Anastase de scta^ Camilla co^maunder de la
Tro^quiere to the capytayne of the carracke / prayenge him to come in to ye
haven with his ship for ye defense of ye town / proferynge him what he would /
assuring him his ship. The capytayne excused him saying yt the marchau^dyse
was not his own but belonged to diverse merchants to whom he must yield
account. Howbeit at the last after many words and promysses to him made he
aryued in to ye haven. The which capytayne was named messire Domingo de
Fournati. And he in his person behaved him valyauntly in the time of the said
syege.

How the great master caused to make general mustres. and sent a vessel to ye
turks navy. of whom he received a lettre.
AFter the month of Apryll ye lord master seeing yt the turks host drew
nere / and that he had the most part of the wafters within ye town he caused
to make general mustres of men of arms. And began at ye knights / the which
upon holy rode day in May made their mustres before the commyssyoners ordained
by ye said lord in places deputed to each of the^ called Aulberge. The which
co^myssioners made report to the lord that they had found ye knights in
good order of harneys and other things necessary for war / and their array
fair and propre with crosses on them. when ye mustre of ye knights was done the
lord master thought to make the mustres of men of ye town and strangers
together. but his wisdom perceived that harm should come thereby rather than
good / doubtinge yt the nombre of people sh^lde not be so great as he would or
neded to have. whereof the great turk might have knowledge by goers and comers
into Rodes. And therefore he caused them of the town to make their mustres
several by bendes and co^panyes. And the strangers also by themself to
the end that the no^bre should not be known. Notwithsta^dynge yt there was good
qua^tyte of good men and well wyllinge to defend themself. And the more to
herty and give them courage and good will some knights of the cross decked
their men with colors and deuyses. and took with them men of the town and
strangers. And with great noise of trompettes and to^merels they made many
must^es / as enuye^ge each other which should keep best array and order / and
have the fayres^ company. It was a great pleasure to se them all so well alyed
and so well willing. The nombre of ye men of the town amou^ted and were
e^temed.iii. or.iiii.M beside men of the vyllages yt might be.xv.C. or.ii.M.
The.viii. day of the same month the turks herynge of those tidings made a
fire for a token in a place called le Fiseo in the main land right against
Rodes. And certain days before they had made another yt is to wit when ye
ship of a knight named Menetow went thither and had with him the clerk of the
galees named Iaquesy trucheman The which under shadow to speak with him was
with holden of the turks. For ye great tu^ke had commanded to take him or
some other man of the Rodes to have parfyte knowledge in what estate ye town
was than in every thing. And they of the town wenynge that ye second fire
was for to deliver Iaquesy / the reverend lord great master ^ent one of his
galeaces / whose patron hight messire Bonyface of Prouance to know the cause
thereof. And when he aryued at the said place of le Fisco he demanded of the
turks wherefore they had made the token of fire. And they said that it was
because their lord had sent a lettre to ye great master. but as yet it was
not ^ome / and desired him to tarry till it were brought. The patron as ware and
wise in the business of the sea thought in himself that the turks made such
prolongynge to some evil intent or to surpryse his vessel being alone,
wherefore he bade them give him ye lettre lightly or else he would go his way /
and neither tarry for lettre nor other thing and told them of the evil and
dyshonest deed yt they had done the days before to withholde the clerk under
their words and sauf^o^duyt. And therewith he turned his galeace to have gone
away. The turk^ seeing that gave him the lettre / the which he took. And when
he was aryued at Rodes he presented it to the lord great master / which
assembled the lords of his counceyle and made it to be read. the tenor
whereof was such as follows.

The copy of the lett^e that the great turk sent to ye lord great master and
to the people of Rodes.
SUltan salyman pach / by the grace of god right mighty emperor of
Constantynople / and of himself holding both the lands of Perse / Araby /
Syrie / Mechei / and Jerusalem. Of Asye / Europe / Egypt / and of all the sea

Rodes / to his counceylours / and to all the other cytezyns great and small
gretynge. Sendynge conuenable and worthy salutacions to your reuere^ces.
Letynge you wit y^ we have received your lettres sent unto our imperyall
mageste by George your servant / ye tenor whereof we have well understand.
And for this occasyon we send unto you this out present commandment to
the end that we will that ye know surely how by our sentence we will have ye

you sclaues / and cause you to deye / with ye grace of god as we have done
many. And hereof have ye no doubt. written in our court at Constantynople the
first day of the month of June.

How the turks came to land in the isle of Lango / and were driven to their
ships again by ye pryour of saint Gyles.
When the lord great master and his council had herd ye tenor of the
lettre they would give none answer to ye great turk. But that he should be
received with good strokes of artyllery. So yt to a folysshe demand behooved
none answer. And it was to believe yt he would none have. For.vi. days after
yt was the.xiiii. day of the said month of June / the brygantynes that went
toward Syo to know of the said army came again and said that of a truth
the said army was coming. And that nygh to Lango an isle of the relygyon a.C.
mile from Rodes they had seen and told.xxx. sails / that were most part
gallees and fustes. The which vessels set men on land in the isle of Lango.
Than ye pryour of saint Gyles messire pre John^ de Bidoux co^maunder of the
said place tarried not long fro horsbacke with his knights and people of the
isle. And he met so well with the turks that he drove them to their ships /
and slew a certain nombre of the^. and of ye side of pre John^ some were
hurt / and his horse was slain. when the enmyes were entered in to their galees
they went to a place called castle Iudeo on main land between ye said isle of
Lango and the castle of saint Peter.

How part of the navy and army of the great turk came before the cite of
Rod^^.
THe.xvii. day of the said month of June these.xxx. galees went fro the said
place / and passed by the cape of Cryon entering the gulfre of Epymes beside
Rodes / and were dyscouered fro the shade of the hill of Salaco / a castle in
the isle of Rodes. On the morrow they came out of the gulfre by plain day. and
saylinge alonge by the costs they entered in to a haven on main loud called
Malfata where they abode three days. Than they went fro thens and returned to
the goulfre of Epymes / where they abode.ii. days and.ii. nyghtes.

The.xxiiii. day of the same month they issued out of Epymes / and trauersynge
the channel they came to the isle of Rodes in a place before a castle called
Faues / and they went to land and brent a great field of corn the same day /
which was the feast of saint John^ baptyst our patron. The guard of a castle
named Absito in the isle of Rodes dyscouered and spyed the great host / and in
great haste brought word to ye lord master / and said yt the said host that
was in so great no^bre of sails yt they might not be no^bred was entered in to
the goulfre of Epymes. The.xxx. sails that lay in the isle arose in the night
and went to the said host in the goulfre.

The.xxvi. day of June ye said great host arose and went out of Epymes an
hour after the son^e rysynge / and trauersynge the channel they came to a
place called la Fosse.viii. miles fro the town. And the.xxx first sails
turned back toward the cape of saint Martyn and other places to watch for
ships of christian men / if any passed by to Rodes. The great host abode still
till noone or one of the clock and than arose / not all / but about.lxxx. or
a.C. ships / as gallees / galeaces / and fustes / and passed one after
another before the town and haven of of Rodes.iii. miles of / and came to a
shore in a place nygh to land called Perambolyn.vi. mile fro the town. In the
which place ye said host abode fro yt time to the end of that unhappy syege.

The nombre and names of the vessels yt came to besyege Rodes.
THe nombre of the ships were these.xxx. galleaces / a.C. and.iii Galls / as
well bastardes subtyle mahonnets.xv. taffours / xx. fustes.lxiiii. great
ships.vi. or.vii. gallyons / and.xxx. galleres / beside ye navy yt waited for
cryste^ men if any came to socour us. These were the vessels yt came at the
first to lay the syege. And sith yt the said host came out of Perambolyn there
came fro Syrye.xx. other sails / as well gallees as fustes. And many other
ships came since and joined with ye said army in time of the said syege. And
it was said that there was.iiii.C. sails and mo.

THe same day ye part of the host came to ye said place the reverent lord
great master ordained a brygantyne so send in to Po^nant to certyfy our holy
fader ye pope and the christian princes how ye turks army was before Rodes. And
in ye said vessel he sent.ii. knights / one a frenchman named sir Claude
dansoyuille called villiers / and and sir Loys dacidoigne a spanyard. and they
went to ye pope and to the emperor. After the coming of the turks navy in to
the said place / it was xiii. or.xiii. days or they set any ordinance on
land great or small^ or descendynge of any quantyte of men / whereof we
marueyled. and it was told us by some that came out of the camp / and also by
^py^s yt the lord great master had sent abroad arrayed as turks that they
abode the commandment of their great lord / and till the host by land were
comen in to the camp. Howbeit there came some nombre for to vewe the town but
they went pryuely for the ordinance of the town shot without cease. All this
while ye galees and galeaces went and came to land bringing vytayle and
people. At the which ships passinge nygh the town was shot many strokes
with bombardes which made some slaughter of our enmyes. And when the most
part of them was past they began to set ordinance on ye land with great
dyligence. Than the lord great master departed fro his palace / and lodged
him nygh a church called La vyctory / because that place was most to be
doubted. and also that at the other sy^ge the gretest business and assaut was
there.

How the lord great master made his petycyon before the image of saint Johan
/ and offered him ye keys of ye town.
THe day before were made many predycacions and se^mons and the last was in ye
church of saint John^ baptyst. when the se^mon was done a ponthyticall mass
was cel^brate with all solempnytees / and all the resykes taken down / and ye
lord great master and al ^i^ ^nyghtes with great d^u^cion and reverence herd
it. And when ye mass was ended the lord great master made a pyteous oration
or praye^ before saint John^ baptist his protector. and above all other words
which were to long to tell he besought him mekely yt it would please him to
take ye keys of ye miserable cite. The which keys he presented and laid
upon the auter before the image / besechynge saint John^ to take the keeping
and proteccion thereof / and of all the religion / as by his grace he had given
to him unworthy ye gouernynge unto ye day. And by his holy grace to defend
the^ fro the great power of enmyes yt had besyeged them.

How the women sclaues would have set fire in the town.
THe.viii. day of July it was known yt the turkysshe women being sclaues and
servants in many houses of ye town had appointed to set fire in their
masters houses at the first assaut that should be made / to th^^de yt the men
should ^eue their posts and defenses to go and save their houses and goods.
And it was found that a woman of Marcho pota being a sclaue was first moeuer
thereof / the which was taken and put to execucyon. The same day some of our
men went out for to scarmysshe with the turks and many of them were slain
with shot of our artyllery / and of our men but one.

How the turks laid their artyllery about the town and of the manner and
quantyte of their pyeces and gonshot.
THe.xvii. day of July for the beginning and first day they set up a
mantellet / under ye which they put.iii. or.iiii. mean pyeces as sacres /
wherewith they shot against ye post of England and Prouaunce. But the
mantellet was soon broken and cast down and their pyeces dystroyed with the
shot of the wall / and they that shot them were most part slain. As this
first mantellet was broken by the great and innumerable people that they had /
they set all their ordinance on land / and carried it to the places where it
should be bent / or nygh thereby.

And the.xxix. day of the same month they set up.ii. other mantellettes. One
beside a church of saint Cosme and damyan / and another toward Ponnau^t. And
fro these ma^tellettes they shot great pyeces as serpentynes / double gonnes /
and great bombardes against ye walls of England and Spain. To the which
mantellets the ordinance of the town gave many great strokes / and often
brake them. And ye more to grieve the town and to feere us they set up many
other mantellets in diverse places / almoost round about the town. and they
were rekened.lxxx. The which no^bre was well lessed by the great qua^tyte of
strokes of artyllery shot out of the town fro many places.

The artyllery of the turks was such as follows.
First there was.vi. great gonnes canonnes perryers of brass that shot a stone
of.iii. foot and a half. Also there was.xv. pyeces of yren that shot stones
of.v. or.vi. spannes. Also there was.xiiii. great bombardes yt shot stones
of.xi. spannes about. Also there was xii. baselyskes / whereof they shot but
with.viii. that is to wit.iiii. shot against the post of England and Spain
/ and.ii. against the gate of Italy / the other.ii shot sometime against saint
Nycolas toure Also there was.xv. double gonnes casting bowls as baselyskes.
The mean shot as sacres / and pasuolans were in great no^bre. The handgonshot
was i^numerable and incredyble. Also there was.xii. pot gon^es of brass yt
shot upward. whereof.viii. were set behi^de ye church of saint Cosme and
damyan / and.ii. at saint John^ de la fountain toward ye port of Italy. and
the other.ii. before ye gate of Auuergne / the which were shot night and day.
and there was.iii. sorts of the^. whereof ye gretest were of.vi. or.vii.
spannes about. And ye said st^nes were cast in to the town to make murdre of
people. which is a thing ve^ay inhumayne and ferefull. which manner of
shotynge is little used among christian men. Howbeit by euydent miracle thanked
be g^d ye said pyeces did no great harms / and sl^we not past.xxiiii. or.xxv.
persons: and the most part women and children. And they began to shote with
the said pyeces fro the.xix. day of the same month unto ye end of August. And
as it was accounted they shot.ii.M. times or few mo or less. Than ye enmyes
were warned by the Jew that wrote lettres to them of all that was done and
said in the town / that ye said potgonnes did no harm / wherefore they were
angry / for they wend that they had slain the third part of our people. and
they were counceyled by him to leave that shotynge / for it was but time lost
and powdre waste / and than they shot no more with them. It is of a truth
that they shot with the said potgonnes.xii. or.xv. times with bowls of brass or
coper full of wild fire / and wha^ they were in ye air they flammed / and in
falling on the ground they brake / and the fire came out and did some harm.
But at the last we knew ye malice thereof / and the people was ware fro coming
nere to them / and therefore they did hurt no mo folk.

How the capytayne Gabryell martyningo came to the socour of Rodes. And all ye
s^laues in danger to be slain.
THe.xxiii. day of the same month a brygantyne aryued yt was sent before in to
Candy / wherein came a worthy capytayne named Gabryel martyningo with two other
capytaynes. And there went to receive him messire prou John^ pryour of saint
Gyles / and the pryour of Navarre. Tha^ after his honorable receyuynge as to
him well aperteyned they brought him before the lord great master / that
louyngly received him / and he was gladly seen and welcomed of the people / as
a man yt was named very wise and ingenyous in feats of war. Than came a
spanyarde renegate fro the host / that gave us warning of all that was done
in the field / and of the approchynge by the trenches that our enmyes made. And
in likewise there arose a great noise in the town that the sclaues turks that
wrought for us in ye dyches had slain their kepers and would have fled /
which was not so. Nevertheless the rumor was great / and they ra^ge alarm /
wherefore the said sclaues coming to prison as it was ordained in all the
alarmes were met of ye people which in great anger put the^ to death / so that
there was slain a.C. and mo the same day. And if it had not ben that the lord
great master made to cry yt none should hurt them they had been all slain /
and there was.xv.C. of them / the which sclaues did great service in time of
the syege. For they labored daily to make our defences^ and to cast earth out
of the dyches and in all works they were necessary at our needs.

How the great turk aryued in person before Rodes
THe.xxv. day of ye said month many of our men went out for to scarmysshe in
ye field and made great murdre of turks and in likewise did our artyllery.
And it is to be noted yt the.xxviii. day of the same month the great turk in
person passed le Fisco a haven in the main land with a galey and a fuste^and
arrived about noone there as his army lay / the which day may be called unhappy
for Rodes. For his coming / his presence and contynuall abiding in the field
is and has been cause of the vyctory that he has had. when the galey that he
came in was aryued all the other ships of the host hanged baners a lofte in
their tops and on their sail yerdes. Soon after that the turk was aryued
he went to land / and mounted on his horse and rode to his pauylion which was
in a high place called Megalandra.iiii. or.v. miles fro the town out of the
danger of the gonne shot. And on ye morrow as it was reported to us he came to
a church nygh the town called saint Steven for to vewe ye town and
fortresses / there as they had set up mantellettes for to lay their ordinance.

THe last day of July one of our brygantynes went out with a good company of
men arrayed as turks / and some of them could speak turkysshe / and went by
night to land through the turks host and demanded if there were any that
would pass over in to Turkey that they should haste them to come. The turks
weninge that they had been of Turkey there entered a.xii. persons / ye which
were led to Rodes. by whom we knew what they did in the field.

The first day of august ye capytayne Gabryell martynyngo was made knight of
the order of the relygion by the lord great master / and was made the first
ancient of the ytalyen tongue of the first balyage or pryory yt should be
vacau^t. And in the mean season the relygyon should give him.xii.C. ducates
for pencyon every year / and ye same day he was received to the council in ye
town of a baylyfe. The.v day of the said month our master gonner was slain
with a gonne / which was great loss for us at that time.

The.xv. day of the said month was known and taken for a traitor messire
John^ baptista the physycyen aforesaid / which confessed his evil and
deuyllysshe doings / and had his heed stryken of.

Of the meruaylous hills yt the turks made before ye town / and how the
capytaynes were ordered in ye trench^s.
AFter coming of the great Turk the enmyes began to shote with ordinance of
another sort than they did before / and specially with ha^busshes and
handgonnes / and also to make their trenches and approches. And also they did
more dyligence than before to bring the er^he nygh ye town with spades and
pycases. And it is to wit yt they moeued ye earth from half a mile of. And
there was shot out of the town innumerable strokes with ordinance against the
said earth / and innumerable quantyte of people hyd behind ye said earth were
slain. Nevertheless they never left workynge till ^hey had brought it to the
bry^mes of the dyches. And when it was there ^hey raised it hyer and hyer in
strengthynge it behind. And in conclusyon the said earth was hyer than the
walls of the town by.x. or.xii. foot / and it seemed a hill. And it was
against the gate of Auuergne and Spain / and bette our men that were at the
gates and bulwerkes in such wise that none durst be seen till certaynes
defenses and repayres were made of pla^kes and bordes to cover our people and
keep them fro ye shot. And at ye gate of Italy was made such another hepe /
and in none other part. when the trenches were thus made to the dyches ye
enmyes made holes in the walls of ye dyche outward. wherthorowe they shot
infynytely with handgonnes to our men as well on ye walls as on the bulwarks
and ^lewe many of them. Than the bachas and capytaynes entered in to the
trenches / each to his place after their order and dygnyte. That is to wit
Monstofa bacha as chyef capytayne entered the trenche dyrcet to the bulwark of
England with his people and capytaynes under him. Pery bacha went to the
trenches against ye gate of Italy with his folks and capytaynes under him. Acmek
bacha was in the trenches of Auuergne and Spain with Lagat des genissayres and
le Beglarby of Romany with him. Le Beglarby de la Notilia was in the trenches
of Prouaunce. Allibey was with his company against the gardyns of saint Anthony
of ye bend of transmontayne and diverse other capytaynes with him / and set his
ordinance against the wall of the gate of Almayne which was but weyke and set
up.vii. mantellets by the mylles toward Ponnant. And by the space of.viii.
or.ix. days they bette upon the same wall / which put us in great fear if
they had continued. Howbeit the noble lord great master forthwt caused to
make repayres within and to set plankes and tables to fortyfy the said weyke
wall. And abode there fro the morning till night to cause it to be the more
hasted. The artyllery of the gate of Almayne / and le Massyf of the gate of the
camp and of the palace bet so sore and so often upon the said mantellette yt
it weryed the enmyes to make and repair them so often / and they took up the
pyeces and bare them away. And also they could not well beat the said wall
because ye brymmes of the dyche without was almoost as hye as the wall that they
bette. But or they bare the artyllery away they bette the steple of saint
Iohn^s church so yt the most part was broken and cast down. The foresaid
mantellets were poynted to beat saint Nycolas toure / and by ye space of x.
or.xii. days they shot sore against it. But they had so sharp and vygorous
answer that there was not one ma^tellet that abode hole an hour. The
capytayne of the said toure and his folk did such dylygence and business in
shotynge of their pyeces that the enmyes durst set up no mo mantellettes by day
/ nor shote no more but only by night while ye moon did shine / which is a
thing worthy of memory / of marvel / and of praise. At the last when they
had beaten against the said ^oure a certain time seeing that it forthered
nothing / they took their ordinance fro thens and bare it where they seemed
best. Du^yu^he shot in the said place the other capytaynes were not idle nor in
a sleep / but without cease night and day they bette the wall of England and
Spain / and had set.xiiii. mantellets against it shotinge great bombardes /
whereof some of the stones were.v. or.vi. spannes about and some other of.ix.
or.x. And within a month and less they had cast down the wall almoost even
smothe with the barbycan. And when ye said wall was so beaten they set to beat
the bulwark of Spain for to reyse the defenses. And in their trenches they
set.iii. great bombardes which shot stones of.xi. spannes of thyckenesse. And
with ye said pyeces they bette the said bulwark and wall in such wise yt they
made great brackes / and the stones and earth that fell served ye enmyes for
ladders so that they might come upon the plain ground In likewise they raised
the defenses fro the heyght of the bulwark at the post of Prouaunce. and
set.iii. great pyeces on the brymme of the dyche / which shot stones of.xi.
spannes against the wall / and within a while they made a bracke as at the
post of Spain. The artyllery of the town did shote without cease against
the mantellettes and brake many of them / but they made other as it is said in
the nyghtes. For they had al thing that belonged to them and neded. And out of
the post of England was shot a gon^e that brake down one of the said
mantellettes / and hitte upon one of the pyeces and slew.iiii. or.v. men / and
bare a way both the legs of the master of the ordinance / which dyed
soon after. whereof the great Turk was very ill content / and said that he had
lever to have lost one of his bachas or capytaynes than the said master. Also
it is to be known that there was.iii. or.iiii. mantellets adressed against ye
plain ground of Italy / and by contynuall beatynge of shot that they made /
there was also a bracke. And by the earth and stones that was fallen they might
come up to it.

Of the polytyke repayres and defenses that the inuentyf capytayne Gabryell
Martyningo made within the town against the brackes in the walls.
THe capytayne Gabryell Martyningo prompt / dylige^t / and expert to give
remedies to ye needful places forthwith made to make the trauerses upon the
wall where as the bracke was with good repayres / and gonnes small and great /
which were set in the said trauerses. The which only shot not at ye brackes
but to ^he trenches / and made great murdre of enmyes as well at the assautes yt
they made as every day. And beside the trauerses the said capytayne made to lay
small artyllery as hacbusshes / and handgonnes upon certain houses wtin the
town / yt stood open against the bracke / with good repayres. And fro yt place
great slaughter of turks was made at the assautes. Also it is of troth that
beside the said mantellettes that shot against the wall of England and Spain
with great bombardes were two mantellets in a hye place to ward the way to the
gardyn of Maupas / in ye which were certain double gon^es as baselyskes with
holowe stones and wild fire in them / which shot against the wall in to ye
town at all auentures for to make murdre of people. Howbeit thanked be god it
did no great harm but to ye houses. After these great and terryble beatynges
/ and that the enmyes had way to mount upon the town walls / and come to
hand with us by trauersynge of their trenches to the fallen earth within the
bracke more surely / and without hurt of our gonshot / shotynge through holes
yt they made in ye walls of the dyche without / they kest up much stone and
earth because it should cover them fro the shot of the bulwark of Auuergne.
And also they shot fervently against the bulwark of Spain for to reyse ye
defenses / of the which at the last they raised the most part / reserving
only a few gonners allow in the mine of the said bulwark / which little or
nothing domaged them. And this is touching the gonshot whereof I say not ye
third part / because it is a thing ^ered idle to them that has not seen it.
For some days they shot with those great bombardes that were on the brymme of
the dyche and fro ye mantellettes bent against the wall of England and
Spain.xx. or.xxx. times and mo. And I believe verily that sych the creacyon of
the world such artyllery and so great quantyte was never bent and laid
before any town as has been against Rodes at this syege. wherefore it is no
marvel if the walls ben and have been be^ell down / and if there be brackes
and clyftes in many places.

Here follows of the mines that the turks made. And how they ouerthrewe part
of ye bulwark of England.
ANd because as it is said before that the gretest hope that the enmyes had to
get the town of Rodes was by mynynge. Therefore now after that I have spoken
of ye gonshot and beatynges I shall show of the mines yt the turk made / the
which were in so great quantyte and in so many places that I believe the third
part of the town was mined. And it is found by account made that there was
about.lx. mines. Howbeit thanked be god many of them came not to effecte^by
occasyon of the cou^tremynes that they wtin made / and also trenches yt the
right prudent lord ye great master made to make deep within ye dyches.
unto.ii. or.iii. foot of the water. The which trenches and certain pyttes
that he had made in the said diches to be wrought or ye host aryued served
right well sith. For night and day there was men in them to watch and harken
when the enmyes mined / for to mete them and cut their way / as was done many
times. And for to speak of the mines that had effect and domaged us / it is to
wit yt the fourth day of Septembre about.iiii. hours after noone the enmyes
put fire in.ii. mines / one was between the post of Spain and Auuergne /
which did no hurt but to the barbican. The other was at the bulwark of
England that was so fell and strong that it caused most part of the town
to shake / and kest down a great part of the said bulwark at the spring of
the day. And by the earth and stones that fell in to the dyches the enmyes came
upon the bulwark with their baners / and fought sore and myghtyly with our men
/ not with hands but with shot of handgonnes. The lord great master that was
come.xv. days or more with his socours to ye said bulwark / went with his
company to help them that fought. After yt they had foughten the space of.ii.
or.iii. hours / the enmyes repulsed and driven back by our men fro the said
bulwark / and beaten with ordinance on every side / withdrewe them with their
loss / shame / and damage. And this was the first vyctory that our lord gave
vs^and there abode of our enmyes a.M. and mo. when this assaut was done they
made another at the bracke in the wall of Spain / and mounted upon it. But
the ordinance of the trauerses of the walls and of the houses made so fair a
ryddaunce yt they were right feign to withdraw them for at there^^^ and also
at they^ coming the said ordinance of the bulwark did them great damage.
albeit yt they had made some repair of earth. Of our men dyed that day.xxv or
therabout / as well knights as other. And the same day in ye morning departed
out of this world Gabryell de Pomerolles lyeutenaunt to the lord master
which on a certain day before fell fro the wall as he went to se ye
trenches in the dyches and hurt his breast and for fault of good attendaunce he
fell in a fever whereof he dyed.

How the turks assailed the bulwark of England and how they were driven
away.
THe.ix. day of the said month at.vii. in the morning the enmyes put fire
in.ii. mines. One at ye post of Prouau^ce / which had none effect. The other
was at the bulwark of England which felled an other pyecenygh to that yt was
casten down before. And ye said mine was as fyers as the other or more for it
seemed that all the bulwark went down. and almoost all they yt were ^n it ran
away. And when the standarde of the relygyon came into the said bulwark the
enmyes were at ye bracke ready to have entered. But when they saw the said
standarde / as people lost and overcome they went down again. Than ye
artyllery of the bulwark of Quosquino / and of other places found them well
enough / and slew many of them. Howbeit their capytaynes made them to return
with great strokes of swerdes and other wepons / and remou^ted upon the earth
fallen fro the said bulwark / and pyght.vii. baners nygh to our repair. Than
our men fought with moryskpykes and fyred speres against them the space of.iii.
hole hours / till at the last they being well beaten with great ordinance and
small on every side withdrewe them. And of their baners our men gate one / for
it was not possible to get any mo. For as soon as any of our men went up on
our repayres he was slain with small gonnes of the trenches / and holes made
in the walls of our diches. And there was slain of our enmyes that day at the
assaut.ii. M. of mean men / and.iii. persons of estate which lay deed alonge
in the dyche with fair and rich harneys. And as it was reported to us from
the camp they were.iii. seniae boys / yt is to say great seneshalles or
stuardes. And of christian men of our part abode about.xxx. persons. And this
was the second vyctory given to us by the grace dyuyne.

How sir John^ bourgh turcoplyer of England was slain at an assaut of the
English bulwark.
THe.xvii. day of the same month about mydday the enmyes came again to give
an other assaute to the said bulwark at the same place aforesaid without
settinge of fire in mines / and brought.v. baners with them nygh to ye
repayres. Than was there strong fyghty^ge on both parts / and there was
gotten two of their baners / of the which sir Xp^ofre Ualdenarc that time
castelayne of Rodes gate one. The other was in the hands of sir John^ bourgh
turcoplyer of England chyef capytayne of the socours of the said post of
England / a valyau^t man and hardy. And in holding of it he was slain with
the stroke of a handgonne / which was great damage. The said baner was
recovered by one of our men. And after long fyghti^ge on both sides ye enmyes
seeing that they gate nothing but strypes returned in to their tre^ches. At ye
said fray ye lord pryour of saint Gyles pre John^ was hurt through the neck
with a handgonne / and was in great danger of death / but he escaped and was
made hole. The same day and the same hour of the said assaute the enmyes
mounted to the bracke in the wall of Spain / and came to the repayres to the
hands of our men and fought a great while. But the great quantyte of artyllery
that was shot so besyly and so sharply from our trauerses on each side / and
out of the bulwarks of Auuergne and Spain scarmysshed the^ so well that there
abode as many at that assaute as at ye other of England well nere to the
nombre of.v.M. And they wtdrewe them with their great loss and confusyon /
which was the third time yt they were chaced and overcome thanked be our
lord which gave us ye force and power so to do / for they were by reason a.C.
against one.

Also the.xxii. day of the same month of Septembre they fyred a mine between
Italy and Prouaunce / which did no harm.

Of the terryble mine at the post of Auuergne.
ANd the.xxiii. day of the same month they fyred.ii. mines one at ye post of
Spain / and the other by the bulwark of Auuergne. the which mine by Auuergne
was so terryble yt it made all the town to shake / and made the wall to open
fro above to beneth unto the plain ground. Howbeit it fell not / for the mine
had spyrall or brethe in.ii. places / by one of the countremynes / and by a
Rock under the barbycan / the which did cleue / and by that clyft the furour
and might of the mine had issue. And if the said.ii. spyralles had not ben ye
wall had be turned vpsodowne. And for troth as it was reported to us out of
the camp the enmyes have great hope in the said mine / wenynge that the wall
should have be overthrown / and than they might have entered in to ye town at
their pleasures. But when they saw the contrary they were right ill pleased.
And the capytaynes delybered them to give assaute at.iiii. places at ones to
make us the more adoo / and to have intrau^ce in to ye town by one of
the.iiii. And the said day and night they ceased not to shote artyllery. and
there came in hope of the mine.lx.M. men and mo in to the trenches.

How the bulwark of Spain was lost / and won again.
THe.xxiiii. day of ye same month a little before day they gave assaut at the
bracke of Spain / to ye bulwark of England / to ye poost of Prouaunce / and
at the plain ground of Italy / all at one hour and one time. The first yt
mounted to the bracke of Spain was Lagat des genissayres a valiant man and of
great courage with his company / and bare.lx. or.lxx. baners and signs / and
pyght them in ye earth of the bracke / and than saught with our men / and mounted
on our repayres making other manner of fray and more rygorous than ye other
that were passed / and ye said medlynge lasted about.vi. hours. And forthwt as
the assaut was given a great sort of turks entered in to ye bulwark of Spain
and set up.viii. or.ix. signs or baners upon it / and drove our men out ^ I
can not tell how / unawares or otherwise. And they were lords of it.iii. hours
and more. Howbeit there was of our men beneth in the mine of the said bulwark.
the which bulwark so lost gave us evil hope. But incontinent the lord
great master being at the defense of ye post of England having knowledge of
the said iosse and that there was great fyghtinge and resystence on both sides
at ye bracke of Spain marched thither with the baner of the crucyfyx / leuy^ge
the charge of the said bulwark in ye hands of ye baylyf de la Moree messire
Merry co^bant. And ye lord mounted on the wall of spain where as than began a
great medlinge / and every man laid his hands to work / as well to put the
enmyes out of the bracke as to recover the bulwark that was lost. And the
said lord sent a company of men in to the bulwark by the gate of the mine /
or by the barbycan the which entered at the said gate and went up where they
found but few turks. For the artyllery of the post of England right
against ye bulwark of Spain had so well met and scattered them yt within a
while our men had slain all them ye were left. And thus the said bulwark was
gotten and recovered again / and with all dylygence were made new repayres and
strengthes to the said place And in likewise the enmyes were put fro the bracke
and few o^ the^ escaped / and all their baners and signs were left with us.
Surely it may be said that after the grace of god (the trauerses of Spain and
Auuergne / and the small artyllery set on the houses right against ye said
brackes as it is said / with the coming and presence of the lord great
master) has given us this journey.

To the regard of the murdre of people done by the artyllery of ye bulwark of
England and Spain / the quantite was such that a man could not perceive nor
se any ground of the dyches. And ye s^enche of the mastyfes caryons was so
greuons that we might not suffer it.vii. or.viii. days after. And at the last
they that might save themself did so / and withdrewe them to the trenches /
And the reverent lord great master abode vyctoryous of the said place / and
in likewise of the other three assautes / ye which were but little le^se than
that of Spain / for they fought long. But in co^clusyon the enmyes beaten on
al sides / and in so many sorts with artyllery were put back and vaynquysshed
that there dyed that day at all the.iiii. places.xv. or.xvi.M. And the
slaughter was so great at the plain of Italy of the cursed enmyes that ye see
was made reed with their blood. And on our side also dyed to the nombre of a.C.
men or moo. And of men of dygnyte in the town having charge dyed sir
Frau^ceys de Frenolz co^maundour de la Romaygne / which sir Frau^ceys was chyef
capytayne of the great ship of Rodes / and he was slain at the plain of
Italy / wounded with.ii. strokes of hacbusshes / it was great damage of his
death for he was a worthy man / parfyte / and full of virtues. There dyed also
messire Nastasy de sancta Camel before named having a.C. men under him of ye
lord great masters socours. There dyed also diverse other worthy men that day
/ and many were maimed. Among all other that lost any membre messyre John^ de
le touz called Pradynes / being at the said bulwark with a stroke of
artyllery had his a^me smyten away in great danger to have lost his life /
howbeit by the help of god he dyed not. In likewise the same day was hurt sir
wyllyam weston abouesayd capytayne of the post of England / and had one of
his fyngers stryken away with a hacbusshe. which knight behaved him right
worthily at all the assautes. Of the turks part of great men were two
pryncypall capytaynes slain under Lagat des genissaires / and another
capytayne that was come out of Surrey to the camp certain days before
with.vi.C. Mamelukes / and.ii. or.iii.M. Moors. And of them that were hurt of
great men le Beglarby de la Notilia had a stroke with an arowe as he was in the
trenche of Prouau^ce. And many other were wounded whose names be not rehearsed
here because of shortness.

How the great turk for anger that he could not get the town would have put
his chyef capytayne to death / and how they made.xi. mines under the bulwark
of England.
During this assaut the great turk was by his pauyllyon in a place that he
had caused to be made / and saw all the besinesse / and how his people were so
sharply put back / and the journey lost on his side he was very sore
dyspleased and half in dyspeyre. And sent for Monstofa bacha with whom he was
angry / and chydde him bytterly / saying that he had caused him to come thither
/ and had made him to believe that he sholtake the town in.xv. days or a
month at the ferdest. and he had been there all ready.iii. months with his army
and yet had they done nothing. And after these words he was purposed to cause
him suffer death in the camp. But the other bachas showed him yt he ought not
to do Justice in the land of his enmyes / for it should consort them and give
them courage / whereby he did moderate his anger and let him for yt time / and
thought to send him to Cayre lest ye people there would rebel / by occasyon
of the capytayne of Cayre which dyed a few days before. Howbeit he departed
not so suddenly / and or he went he thought to assay if he might do some thing
for to please the turk / as well for his honor as for to save his person.
and made meruaylous dylygence to make mines at the bulwark of England for to
overthrow it. And by account was made.xi. mines as well to ye said bulwark as
else where / beside them spoken of before / and that they had fyred But the
most part of ye said mines came to no proof though they put fire in them /
and many were met with countremynes / and broken by our men by the good dylyge^ce
and solycitude of sir Gabryell du chef stuarde of the house to the lord great
master / which had the charge of the said countremynes at the same bulwark.
In ye which business he behaved him well and worthily / and spared not his
goods to cause the people work and travail / but spent thereof largely.

How the turks were minded to have gone their way / and of the traitors wtin
the town / and of many great assantes.
THe turks seeing yt by mynynge they were nothing forthered / nor might not
come to their intencyons / and having but small store of powdres were in
delyberacyon and mind to have raised the syege and gone their way. And in deed
some of them made to bear their caryages toward the ships. and also certain
nombre of people went out of ye tre^ches with their standards straight to ye
ships. And it was written to us fro the camp how the genyssayres and other of
the hooste would fight no more. and that they were almoost all of one opinion
for go away / sauf some of the capytaynes of the foresaid Monstofa bacha or
Acmek bacha. And in the mean season the false traytoures that were in the town
wrote lettres to the camp gyuynge them knowledge of all that was said and done
among us. And also an Albanyti fled to the enmyes camp and warned them not
to go / for ye gonshot was nygh wasted / and that the most part of the
knights and people should be theyrs shortly. In likewise than wrote ye
abouesayd chaunceler sir Andrew de Merall / whose treason as than was not
known. But when it comes to the effect of his treason I shall show the
knowledge that he gave to the enmyes at diverse times. when the bachas and
capytaynes of the host understood the said warnynges they all purposed for to
tarry / and caused those tidings of the town to be known over all the army.
And began again to shote artyllery faster than ever they did / for new shot
was comen in to the camp. Than Monstofa bacha being in dyspayre yt he could
do no thing by mines / by gonshot / nor by assautes he being ready to depart
for to go in to Surrey by the great turks co^maundeme^^ before his departing
he thought ones again to assaye his adventure / and made.iii. assautes.iii.
days together. The first was on a saturday the.iiii. day of Octobre an hour
before night. The other on sunday in the morning. and the third on monday
after dinner. And ye said.iii. assautes were made to ye bulwerke of England.
And it was assailed but with stones and bags full of artyfyce tire. And at
these iii. assautes many of our men were hurt with the said fire / and with ye
stones that came as thycke as rain or hayle. But finally ye enmyes gate
^othynge but strokes / and returned in to their trenches evil contented and
murmuring / and swear by their Machomet that Mo^stofa bacha should not make
them to mount any more to the said bulwark. And that it was great folly for
them to make them be slain at ye will and fantasy of one man. These words
said in greek by some of the enmyes were herd of our men as they went down
fro ye bulwark. And because (as it is said) that the enmyes at the assautes yt
were made came up by ye e^the and stones yt fell fro the brackes / some of our
men aduysed to cleanse the barbycan / and take the earth out of the dyche / to
the end that the enmyes should not easily come upon ye wall. And in effect
wenynge that it were well and behouefull to be done / by great dylygence night
and day by mines they voyded ye barbycan / and the most part of the earth
that lay in the dyche was brought in to the town the which was hurtful
afterward and was cause yt the enmyes gate the foot of the wall.
Notwtstandynge they had it but scarcely. But this clensynge forthered the time
and caused them to get it sooner than they should have done if the earth had
lain still. But their fynal intent was to reyse the defense of the bulwarks /
and than pass at their pleasure and enter in to the barbycan as they have
done. For ye enmyes seeing yt the said barbycan was cleansed they thought to
get in to it by trenches / and so they did. Howbeit they were certain days
let by our hand gonne shot. The enmyes seeing that they might not come nere
it they covered their trenches with tables to save themself. And than they made
a mine whereby they might go to the barbycan. So by these two means after yt
they were repaired with earth and with a certain wall yt they made for to
eschew ye shot of the bulwarks of Auuergne and Spain. And in ye mine they
found but two gonners / which they slew by force of men. By this manner they
being covered on all parts / and without any danger passed through and lepte
in to the barbycan / and gate the foot of the wall. which was the.xvii. day
of Octobre / an unhappy day for ye poor town / and occasyon of the ruin
thereof / and winning yt they had. At this point they slept not / but lightly
and with great dylyge^ce they began ^o pycke and hew the wall. And we wenynge
to make ^emedy therefore / and to find means to drive them fro ye said
barby^an with gynnes of fire and barylles of powdre wherwt we slew many of
them / but it auayled nothing. For the quantyte and multitude of people yt
trauayled there was so great that they cared not for loss of them. And if we
had had men ynowe wtin the town there might have been remedy to have raised
them fro thens. But co^syderynge yt our force and total hope was in people /
whereby we left to do many things yt might have been done and that should have been good than / and other times also for fault of men of war. At the last it
was pondred by sir Gabryell martiningo that there was no remedy but to hew the
wall for to mete them and beat them with ordinance and with gyunes of fire
to brenne and undo them. Than our men began to hew ye wall / and made some
holes to shote at the enmyes that slept not / but did as we did / to shote at
us / and in deed they slew and hurt many of our men. Than sir Gabryell
martiningo ordained to make repayres wtin the town at ye fro^te where they
did cut the wall / to the end that after the walls were cut ye enmyes should
know with whom to mete. The trauerses were made on each side with good artyllery
great and small. And the said trauerses and repayres were of the length yt the
enmyes had cut the wall. and began at the massyf of Spain made by the
reverent lord great master Merry damboyse / and ended at ye church of saint
Saluador. The which trauerses and repayres ye vulgar people call la Mandra /
that is to say / the field. The mean time yt the repayres and trauerses were
made with all dylygence sir Gabryell Martini^go never ceased going to every
place to pouruey for all things. And he being on ye bulwark of Spain to
ordeyne all thing that was needful there came a stroke of a handgonne fro the
trenches yt smote out his eye / and put hy^ in danger of his life / but
thanked be god he returned to health within a month and a half. His hurt
came evil to pass for the need that we had of him that time in all things /
and specially to the repayres of the brackes. Nevertheless the lord pryour of
saint Gyles (not ignoruant in all such things) with other men expert in
war intended to ye said repayres and trauerses / there and else where. The
enmyes on the other side night and day without rest (for ye great nombre of
laborers that they had hourly and new redyly) hewed and undermined the said
wall. And the.xx. day of Octobre they put fire in the vndermynes wenynge to
have cast down the wall / but they could not. Than they would have pulled it
down with great ropes and ancres. But the artyllery of the bulwark of
Auuergne brake their ropes and sent the^ away lightly. At the last they made a
mine under the said wall and bracke. And the.vi. day of the same month they
did put fire to the same mine / wenynge to have overthrown the wall / which
it did not but raised it and made it to fall almoost straight vpryght / which
was more dysauauntage to the enmyes than profit. Than they shot artyllery at
it which in few days was beaten down / and they had openyuge and way to come
in to the town. Nevertheless it was not necessary for them as than to enter.
For ye artyllery of our repayres bette them in the fore parce / and the
artyllery lyenge at the.ii mylles at the post of Quosquino / and in that of
England / where as was a baselyke that bet right upon the bracke with other
pieces. And therefore the enmyes sought other means / and began to reyse the
earth between our two walls / drawing toward England on the one side / and
toward Auuergne on the other side / and would have cut the wall ferder than
our trauerses were for to come in unbeaten of our artyllery. Than were the
repayres enlarged and made more with the wall yt was cut / of the heyght
of.xii. or.xvi. foot in bread. And so the enmyes might go no ferder forward /
but shot great artyllery agayust our repayres for to break and cast them
down. And also they made trenches for to come right to the bracke / and unto
the repayres. And certainly we looked day by day and hour by hour for to have
some assaute. The reverent lord great master the which as it is said had
left the bulwark of England the day that the great assaute was made / and
sith that time heimoeued not fro thens as they hewed the wall / and there as
the bracke was / because yt they were the most dangerous and the most
vnquyete places. And co^tynually the said lord kept him behind the said
repayres with his knights and men of socours / intentyfly ready and apparayled
to live and dye / and to receive his enmyes as they ought to be received And he
abode.iii. or.iiii. days at the said bracke contynuynge sith it was made unto
the end / fighting with his enmyes every day in great peril of his body. For
oftentimes he put himself ferder in the prease than neded / for the
unquietness of his person. But he did it for to herten and strength the
courage of his people / being so well willing to defend and dye for the
^aythe.

How the enmyes assailed the posts of Prouaunce and Italy / and how they were
driven away.
BY the will of our lord the enmyes always in fear and dread would give none
assaut / but co^tynually shot against our repayres / and made trenches for to
pass forward in to the town. By the which trenches they shot infynitly with
hacbusshes and handgonnes / and slew many of our folk / and specially of them
yt wrought and made the repayres yt were broken and ^rased. And they put us in
such extremyte that we had almoost no moo s^laues nor other labourynge people
for to repair that / yt they brake night and day / which was a great
hyndraunce for us and beginning of our perdycion. And if we had much to do in
yt place / there was not less at the gate of Prouaunce / and at the plain of
Italy. For daily they were doing either with assaut or scarmysshe / and most at
ye plain of Italy. Howbeit by the help of our lord with the good condutynge of
the capytayne of socours of the same place the pryour of Navarre yt was prompt
and intent if / and could well encourage his men the enmyes had always the worst
/ and were driven fro ye said plain / and fro the bracke of Prouaunce.

How the treason of sir Andrew de Merall was known / and of the meruaylous
assautes that the turks made.
UPon these terms and assautes the treason of the chaunceler sir Andrew de
Meral / of whom I spoke of before was apperceyued. For a servant of his named
Blasy was found shotynge a quarrel of a crosbowe with a lettre / whereof he was
accused to ye lord great master / which made to take him and examyn him by
Justice / and he confessed the shot of yt lettre and other before at the
commandment of his master. And said yt he had great acquayntau^ce with the
Turks bachas / and that it was not long sith he had written a lettre to them /
warning them yt they should not go / for gonshot began to fail and the men
were wasted by fleing and hurtynge at the assautes in great quantyte. And if
they abode still and gave mo assautes / at the last ye town should be theyrs.
And diverse other things the servant said of his master / of ye which I have
spoken part before at the beginning / and of the warning yt he gave to the
great Turk for to come. But to return to the plain of Italy. After many
batayles and assautes done in the said place by contynuall shot of.xvii. great
gonnes yt bet the said plain / the repayres and trauerses were almoost broken
and lost. And by trenches the enmyes were come ioyninge to ye bracke / and
never ceased to grate ye earth and scrape the earth to cause the repayres and
trauerses to fall / And at ye last the most part fell down / and our men
were constrained to leave the said plain / sauf a cantell yt was toward yt see
/ as it were the third part thereof. Certain days before the enmyes came to
the foot of the plain / and did cut it / and raised the earth / and at the
last they passed through unto the town wall. and anon began to hew and cut
as they did at yt of Spain. The lord great master seeing yt anon made to
cast down a part of the church of our lady de la Uictory / and of an other
church of saint Panthalion. And wtin the^ began to make the repayres and
trauerses as at the place of Spain. whereto was made extreme dylygence / but
not such as the lord would / and as was needful / because there was no
laborers for to help. After that the enmyes had won the most part of the
bulwark of England and the plain of Italy they were purposed to make assaut
to ye ^ayd plain and to the bracke of Spain / and to enter in to our repayres
to win them for to have the end of us. And for ever to affeble the repayres
and for to abasshe us / the.xxviii. day of Nouembre all alonge the day and
night they ceased not to shote great artyllery / both fro the brymmes of the
dyches with those great pyeces casting stones of.ix. and.xi. foot thycke / and
fro the mantellettes without. And as it was rekened they shot the same day and
night a.C. and.l. times or more against our repayres and trauerses of the
wall. And in the morning the.xxix. day of the same month the vygyll of saint
Andrewe at the spring of the day the enmyes went through ye bracke with their
baners and entered in to the repayres with greter no^bre of people than they
did at the great battle in Septembre / hardyly and furyously for to fight
with us. But at their coming in the artyllery of the trauerses and the
handgonnes / and the gonshot of the mylles found them so well and so sharply
that he that came in was anon dispatched and overthrown / and there abode
above.ii.M. of the turks slain. The other that came after seeing their
felawes so evil welcomed / as people that were astonyed and lost they turned
again to their trenches. to whom the artyllery of the mylles shot
vygoryously / and hasted them to go a pace. And by report fro the camp there
dyed six thousand or mo that day. The which day might be called very happy /
and well fortunate for us thanked be god. For there was none that thought to
escape that day / but to have dyed all and lost the town. Howbeit the pleasure
of our lord was by euydent miracle to have it otherwise / and the enmyes were
chased and overcome. And it is to be noted that the same day the rain was so
great and so strong / that it made the earth to synke a great dele yt they had
cast into the dytches for to cover them fro the shot of Auuergne. And the
said earth being so sonken / the artylery of the said bulwark (unawares to
them) smote them going and coming and made great murdre of the said dogs.
The said day also the enmyes came to the plain of Italy for to assaute it /
but wha^ they understood that their fellows had been put back so rudely / and
with so great slaughter they were afraid / and so they returned again to
their trenches.

How the Turks gate the plain ground of Italy.
ANd that done Acmek Bacha seeing their besynes every day go fro wors to wors /
and that at ye assautes was but loss of people without doing of any good /
and that there was no man that wyllyngely would go to it any more / he intended
to give no mo assautes / but to follow his trenches / and by them enter
dyscouertly without loss of a man fro ye bracke to the other end of the
town. Semblably he intended for to win the plain earth beside Spain. The
which to get he came at pleasure to ye foot of ye wall / and began to beat
down the plain ground and to give many scarmysshes and conflyctes to our
folk that kept it. And there was slain many good men. And at the last for
defaute of more help / and of gonshotte it was left and given up of our men /
and so lost. That done the enmyes came thither as in other places. And this is
the third place that they came nere to the foot of y^ wall. And who that well
considered in what estate that the poor town was in that time seeing their
enmyes have so great advantage / might well say and judge that at length it
should be taken and a lost town.

How a Geneuey came to the gate of the town for to speak for a treaty / and
delyueraunce of the same.
AFter yt the said Journey was won / a few days after a christen man that
was in the camp / the which by his speech was a Geneueys or Cyotis came to
the gate of Auuergne / and demanded to speak / and after that he was
questyoned what he would have / he said that he had marvel of us why we would
not yield us / seeing the pyteous degree yt the town was in. And he as a
christen man cou^seyled us to yield us with some agreement. And that if we would
look thereto / yy some should be found expedyent to do somewhat for our
saufgarde. And it is to believe that he said not such words nor spoke so
ferforthe in the matter without commyssyon of some of the chyef of the camp /
or of ye great Turk himself. To ye which Cyotis was answered that he should
go away with an evil hap / and that it neded not to speak of a poyntment.
And that though the enmyes had great advantage / yt there was yet enough
wherewith to receive and feast them / if they made any assaute. These words
herd he went away. And two days after he came again and demanded to speak
with a merchant Geneueys of the town named Mathewe de Ura / and he was
answered yt he which he demanded was seek / and might not come / but that he
should deliver the letter and it should be given to him. The said Cyotis said
nay / and that he would give it himself and speak with him. And said yt he had
also a letter of ye great lord / for the lord master. Upon this he was boden
to go his way / and to further him to go / they shot after hy^ a pyece of
artylery. The next day after Balla^tis Albanyty that was fled through ye
bracke of Spain to ye camp came fro the said Geneueys proposynge such words
or like as the other had said / saying likewise that the great lord had sent
a letter to ye lord master. To whom no words were spoken nor answer made /
for the lord great master as wise and prudent considering that a town that
will here entreatynges is half lost / made to defend upon the pain of death
sith that Cyotis had spoken those two times that none should be so hardy to
speak nor answer to them of ye camp / without his knowledge and commandment
/ but seeing they were such embassadoures / they reported the words of the
said Albanyty / or ever ye said lord had knowledge of the words of Cyotis.
The which words spredde through ye town put many folk i^ thought / and
would have undone y^ that Cyotis said. The which is no marvel there as is
much people / for with good will and most often they regarded more sooner to
save the life of them and their children tha^ they do to the honor of the
resydue. Howbeit not one durst speak a word openly of that business / but all
secretly. And some came and spoke to certain lords of ye great cross for to
speak to ye lord great master. And in effect some lords spoke thereof to him
/ enhortynge him that it should be good to think thereon / seeing that ye town
went to loss. To whom the said lord showed many things for his honor and
the reylgyon. And yt no such things ought to be done nor thought / for any
thing in the world / but rather he and they to dye. The lords herynge this
answer went their ways / and than returned again to the said lord /
aduysynge him more to think well on all things and to the salvation of his
town and of his relygyon. And they said moreover yt they doubted yt the people
would rather have apoyntment than to dye / and their wives and children. The
lord seeing yt such words were as things enforced (as who should say) if
thou do it not / we shall do it as wise men and prudent / willing to make
remedies of needful things by counsel made to call the lords of his counsel
for to have advise in these doings and other. And wha^ they were assembled /
the lord proposed the words that were to him denounced / and said. With these
terms and words came two or three merchants and cytezyns of ye town that
knocked at the door of ye counsel and presented a supplycacyon to ye great
master / and lords of ye counsel / whereby they required and besought mekely
ye ^ayd reverend lord have respyte to them and their poor housholdes / and
to make some apoyntment with the great Turk / seeing that the said matter was
all ready forward in purpose that he would do it. And that it would please him
to consider the pyteous and sorrowful estate that the town was in. And that
there was no remedy to save it. And at the lest way if the lord would not make
a poyntmente to give them leave (of his goodness) to have their wives and their
children out of ye Rodes to save them for they would not that they were slain
nor made slaves to the enmyes. And the co^clusyon was that if the said lord
would not puruey therefore / they would puruey for it themself. And there was
written in the said request the names of eyghte or ten of the rychest of the
town (which words of the said supplycacyon herd) the said lord and his
counsel were abashed and evil content as reason would / seeing that it was
but a course game / and thought on many things to make answer to ye said
cytezyns / for to content and appease them And also to se if they should
intend to the apoyntment / as they required / and after as the Geneuoy had
reported. And the better to make the said answer / and to know more plainly
in what degree ye town was in all things. That is to wit / first of powders /
and than of men of war / and of the katteryes. Also were interroged and
questyoned the lord of saint Gyles Pre Johan which had the charge of the
powders / and than the capytayne sir Gabryell Martynyngo for being over their
men of war (as it is said) as to him yt knew the truth if the town might
hold or not / or there were expedyent to save it. The said lord of saint
Gyles arose saying and affyrmynge upon his honor and his conscience that
almost all the slaves and laborers were deed and hurt. And yt scantly there
was folk ^nowe to remoeue a pyece of artilery fro one place to an other / and
that it was impossible without folk any more to make or set up the repayres
the which every day were broken and crusshed by the great / furyous / and
co^tynuall shot of the enmyes artylery. As for powders ye said lord said /
that all that was for store in the town was spent long agone. And of that /
that was newly brought was not to serve and furnysshe two assautes. And he
seeing the great advantage of the enmyes bey^ge so far within the town
without power to put or chase them away for defaute of men was of the opinion
that the town would be lost / and that there was no means to save it. The
words of the said lord fynysshed / the capytayne Gabryell Martynyngo for his
dyscharge said and declared to the reverend lord and them of the counsel /
that seeing and considering the great betynges of shot that the town had
suffered / and after seeing the entering that the enmyes had so large / and
that they were within the town by their trenches both endelonge and
ouerthwarte. Seeing alsoo that in two other places they were at the foot of the
wall / and that ye most part of our knights and me^ of war and other were
slain and hurt / and the powders wasted / and that it was impossible for the^
to resyste their enmyes any more / that without doubt the town was lost if
there came no socoures for to help and resyste the syege. The which opynyons
and reasones of these two worthy men and expert in such feats understood
and po^dred by the lord great master and the lords of the council / they
were most part aduysed for to accept and take treaty if it were offered / for
the saufgarde of the common people / and of the holy relykes of the church / as
part of ye holy cross / the holy thorn / the hand of saint Johan and part
of his heed / and diverse other holy relykes. Hobeit the lord great master to
whom the business belonged very nere / and that took it most heuyly ^and was
more sorrowful than any of the other as reason required was always steadfast in
his first purpose / rather willing to dye than to consent to such a thing /
and said again to the lords of ye council. Advise you and think well on
every thing / and of ye end that may happen / and he preposed to them.ii.
points. That is to wit. whyder is it better for us to dye all / or to save
the people and the holy relykes. The which.ii. points and doubts were long
time dysputed / and there was diverse opynyons. Nevertheless at ye last they
said all yt howbeit that it were well and saufly done to dye for the faith and
most of honor for us. Notwithstanding seen and considered yt there is no
remedy to resyste against our enmyes / nor means to save the town. And on the
other part that ye great Turk would not oppress us to forsake our faith /
but only would have the town / it were much better than and sou^dynge to
greter wealth to save all the iewelles abouesayd that should be defoyled and
lost if they came in the hands of the enmyes of the faith. And also to keep
so much small people as women and children yt they would tourment and cut some
in pyeces / other take and parforced to cause them to forsake their faith /
with innumerable vyolences and shameful sins that should be committed and
done if the town were put to blood as was done at Modon / and lately at
Bellegrado. whereby they did conclude that it were better and more agreeable to
god for to take the treaty if it were proffered than for to dye as people
desperate and without hope.

How the great turk sent two of his men to the town to have it by
entreatynge. And how the lord great master sent two knights to him to know
his assurance.
Upon these termynacyons and words the dyuynite yt saves them trusting in
him / and yt would not that so many euylles and crueltees should come to ye
poor cite and inhabytauntes of it. And also yt the great turk arise not in
over great pride and vaynglory / put him in will to seek to have ye said town
by treaty which he ought not to have done for his honor / nor by reason / for
ye town in a manner was his. And in likewise he ought not to have leten us go
as he did / seeing yt we were his mortal enmyes ever / and shall be still in
the time coming / consyderinge the great slaughter of his people yt we have
made in this syege. Howbeit ye eternal goodness has blinded him / and has
pleased that these things should be thus / for some cause unknown of us. And
for conclusyon y^ great turk sent to have a comunycacion and speaking together
/ in following ye words of the Geneuey aforesaid. Than was a sign set upon ye
church des le Monistres without the town. to the which was made answer with
another at the mylles of Quosquino. And forthwith came.ii. turks for to speak
with them of the town. Than the lord great master sent the pryour of saint
Gyles pre John^ / and ye capytayne Gabryell martiningo to know ye cause of
their coming. And wha^ they came to them without holding of long purpose the
two turks delivered them a lettre for to bear to the lord great master fro
the great turk / and than returned surely in to their tents. when the two
lords had received it they bare and presented it to the reverent lord great
master which caused it to be read. By the which the great turk demauned of
the lord great master to yield ye town to him / and in so doing he was
content to let him goo and all his knights / and all the other people of what
condycyon so ever they were / with all their goods and jewels sauf / without to
have fear of any harm or dyspleasure of his folks. And also he swear and
promised on his faith so to do. The said lettre was sealed with his sygnet yt
he uses / that is as it were gylted. And he said afterward yt if the lord
great master would not accept the said treaty / that none of ye cite of what
estate so ever he were should think to escape / but that they all unto the
cattes should pass by the edge of the sword / and that they should se^de him
an answer forthwith / either ye / or nay. After the sight of the contents of
the said lettre of so great weight / and the time so short for to give so
great an answer and with demand / the said lord great master and all the
lords of the council were in great thought. howbeit they were delybered to
give answer. Seeing the ordinance of the town so ill yt it could be no wors.
Herynge y^ report and oppynyons a day or two before of the.ii. lords ordained
upon ye effects of the town / saying yt the town was lost without remedy.
Considering also yt the pryncypalles of the town would have appoyntement. And
in likewise at the other council all ye lords had all ready wylled and
declared yt it were better to save ye towfor respect of the poor people / than
to put it all hole to the furour of ye enmyes. where upon they agreed and
concluded to take the foresaid treaty. After the conclusyon taken^ answer was
made redyly for a good respect. That it to wit to take the Turk at his word
to the end yt he should not repent him of it nor change his oppynion. For
every hour his people wanne and entered ferder and ferder in to the town. And
for to go unto the great Turk was ordained these two knights / sir Passyn
before named / and he bare the token of ye white cross. And another of the
town named Robert de Perrutis judge ordynary. when these two ambassadors had
made them ready they went out at the gate of Quosquino and went to the tent of
Acmek bacha capytayne general. And because it was late / and yt they might not
go that day to the great Turk / on the next day in ye morning the foresaid
capytayne Acmek led and conveyed our said ambassadors to the great Turks
pauyllyon / that they might have knowledge more plainly / and for to here his
will as touching ye words the which were reported to ye reverent lord great
master and after the co^tentes of his lettre and wrytynges. when ye said two
ambassadors were departed out of the town there did enter two men of
auctoryte of the camp. One was neuew or kynnesman of the said Acmek. the other
was the great turks trucheman / which the lord master caused to be well
received / and they were lodged nygh the said gate of Quosquino. And than
trewes was taken for iii. days. and the enmyes came to our repayres and spoke
with our folk and drank one with another.

How the ambassadors of Rodes spoke with the great turk / and what answer
they had.
When our ambassadors had made reverence to ye great Turk / they said that ye
lord great master of Rodes had sent the^ to his imperyall mageste to know
what he maunded / and demanded as to have speaking together / and how the great
master had received his lettre. The great Turk made to answer them by his
trucheman / yt of demanding to speak together / nor writing of lettre to ye
great master he knew nothing. Howbeit sith the great master had sent to him
for to know his will / he bade say to them that the great master should yield
him ye town. And in so doing he promised by his faith for to let him go
with all his knights / and all other yt would go with their goods / without
to have any dyspleasure of his people of the camp. And if he accepted not y^
said treaty to notyfy him that he would never depart fro before Rodes till he
had taken it / and that all his might of Turk y^ should dye there but if he had
it / and yt there should neither great nor little escape / but unto the cattes
they should be all put in pyeces. And said yt within.iii. days they should
give him an answer. For he would not that his people should lose time. And yt
during the said trewes they should make no repayres nor defenses wtin the
town. when the great lord had ended his words our ambassadors took their
leave of him / and returned to ye town / and there was given to each of them a
rich garment of brau^ched velvet with clothe of gold of ye turkysshe facyon.
Than Acmek bacha took sir Pessyn / and led him to his pauyllyon / and
intreatynge him right well caused him to abide al yt day and night. And in
eating and drinking they had many purposes of things done at the syege /
questyonynge each other. And among all other things our a^bassadour demanded
of Acmek / and prayed him to tell for troth how many men dyed of the ca^pe sith
ye syege was laid. The said bacha swear upon his faith and certyfyed yt there
was deed of the camp of vyolent death / that is to say of gonshot and other
ways. lxiiii.M. men or mo / beside them that dyed of sickness which were
about.xl. or.l. thousand.

How one of the ambassadors made a^swere of his message And how the comyns
would not agree to yield the town.
Return we now to our purpose and to the answer yt our ambassadors brought
to ye lord great master. The said Robert Perruse made the answer and told
what the great turk had said / certyfye^ge yt he would have an answer lightly
either ye or nay. The which answer after the demand of the great turk has been purposed and concluded by ye hole council and his offer and treaty
accepted / howbeit the said ambassadors had it not to do so soon nor the
first time that they went for good reasons / but yet they would not dyfferre it
for fear that he should repent him. And upon these termynacyo^s yt they would
have sent the said Peruse to bear the answer came some of the common people of
ye town to the lord great master yt was with the lords of the council /
and said yt they were aduertysed of the apoynteme^t that he had made with the
great turk / and yt he would yield the town with couenau^tes by him taken /
which they seemed ought not to be done wout calling of them. And because they
were not called to it they said yt they would not agree thereto. And yt it were
better for them to dye / for y^ great turk by some way would put them all to
death / as was done in Bellegrado in Hungry.

How the lord great master sent two ambassadors for the comyns to the great
Turk.
When the reverent lord great master had herd their words he said
gracyously to them yt as touching to have accept the great turks offer it was
of force so to do in the degree yt the town was. and the causes wherefore he had
done it the council had seen and dyscussed / and yt it was a thing that
might not / nor ought not to be said nor publysshed in common for reportynge of
it to ye enmyes by traitors / but be kept still and secret. And moreover yt
it was concluded to make an answer shortly / for to take the great turk at
his word lest he repented him. For if they had been called or ye answer had be
given it had been over long business / and in the mean time the turk might
have changed his mind / and that ye he had done and concluded with the great
turk the lords of the council had well regarded and considered in all things
/ and for their prouffyte and advantage as much or more as for yt of the
relygion. And yt they would send to the great Turk again other ambassadors
the better to know his will and to be surer of his promysse. Than ye lord
great master ordained.ii. other ambassadors for to go to ye great turk /
which where.ii. Spanyardes / ye one named sir Raymon market / and the other
messire Loup / at whose yssuenge entered sir Passyn ye first ambassador / and
the other.ii went to ye tent of Acmek bacha for to lead them to ye great turk.
And when they were wtin the turks pauyllyon / and had done him reverence as
apperteyned our ambassadors said yt the great master had herd and seen his
demand to yield ye town. And for yt it is a thing of great weight and yt he
had to do and say with many men of diverse nacyons / and because the time of
answer was so short he might not do yt / yt he demanded so soon. Howbeit he
would speak with his people / and than he would give him an answer.

How the turk began the assaut / and how the comyns agreed to yield the town.
When the great turk herd the answer of our ambassadors / he said nothing
but commanded his bachas yt they should begin the battle again to the town
/ yt which was done. And than the trewes was broken and the shot of the
enmyes was sharper than it was before. And on the other side nothing or very
little for fault of powdre. For that / that there was left / was kept for some
great assaute or need. Howbeit the said Acmek Bacha kept one of the
ambassadors and messyre Loup only entered. The great master seeing the war
begone / and the shot thycker than it was before / and the enmyes enter
hourly by their trenches ferder into the town / made to call them that tofore
had said to him that they would not ye town should be yielded / but had lever
for to deye. And therefore the said lord said that he was content for to deye
with them / and that they should dyspose them to defend themself well / or to
do their devour better tha^ they had done in time past. And to the end yt each
one of them should have knowledge of his will (for as than he spoke but to four
or five of them that gaynsayd him). He made a cry thrughe all the town yt all
they that were holden to be at the posts or gates should give attendaunce /
and not to come away day nor night on pain of death. For before the Rodyens
came but little there. And that the othet that were not of ye posts / or that
were of his socours / should go to ye bracke of Spain where the said lord was
contynually / and not to go away day nor night on the above said pain. The
said cry made each one were obedyente for a day or twain / howbeit a young
Rodyen left his post and went to his house / which on ye next day was
hanged for brekynge of the lords commandment. Not withsta^dynge that by
little and little the people anoyed them and their hertes failed / and left
the posts and brackes / in such wise that the enmyes might come in without to
find great resystence / but of a few that ye lord master caused to abide
there (yt is to wit) knights of his socours And in the night made to search
mo people for to keep the watch at the said bracke / and paid to them asmoche
as they would. The said lord seeing him thus abandoned and left of his people
/ he made to ask them again wherefore they did not their devour / and why they
came not to deye / as they said before. which made answer yt they saw and
knew well that the town was lost for certain reasones yt was told the^ / by
occasyon whereof they had gaynsayde ye ordinance of the said lord / and said
that they had be wrong informed of diverse things. And on the other side that
they fered that ye Turk would not hold his word. But sith they saw that
there was none other remedy but to abide the adventure and fortune / they said
that they put all to the said lord to do that he seemed good / and y^ he would
se what were best for them. And required the lord to do them somoche grace as
to let them chose one or two among the^ for to go to ye great Turk with his
ambassadors for to have surety of him. The which was granted / and two
ordynary ambassadors were chosen for them / one Nycholas Uergoty / and the
other Piero of saint Cretyce / and ye foresaid Passyn should return with them
for to make the said answer. Than the great master or they departed
(prolongynge the time as in much as he might) aduysed to send a letter to the
great Turk / the which his grauntfader had written or caused to be written. In
the which letter he gave his malediction or curse to his children and
successors / if they interprysed to besyege Rodes. The said Robert Perruce
bare the said letter. And as he was acustomed / he went to Acmek Bacha for to
cause him to have audyence / and present the said letter. And Bacha said he
would se ye letter. For it is ye guyse in the great Turks court that none may
speak to him nor give hy^ letter / but he be aduertysed first / what shall be
said or what shall be written. when ye Bachas had seen the words written in the
said letter / he brake it and kest it on the ground / and did trede upon it /
saying many iniuryous and velanous words to the said Judge. And badde him to
return fast to his great master / and bydde him to think on his business /
and to make answer to the great lord (as he had sent and commanded) or else
it should not be long or he saw his dolorous and woeful end. And that same
day were taken two men of ours that bare earth toward the bulwark of
England. Of whom the said Acmek caused an offycer to cut of their noses /
fyngers and eeres and gave them a letter to bear to ye lord great master.
wherein was great words and thretenynges. After the said Perruce was returned /
messyre Passyn was sent again to the said Bacha / for to wit of him if the
great Turk would be content with any sum of money for his costs and
expenses / that he had made for his army. The which answered that such words
nor offres of silver was not to be said nor presented to the great lord / on
pain of life / and that he set more by honor than by silver. And therefore he
bade him return and say to the great master that he make answer to the great
lord after his demand to yield or not yield the town. The said Passyn made
relacyon of ye words of Bacha to ye great master. The which for the great
sorrow that he had (dyfferred always) saw himself in such pyteous estate.
Notwithstanding the said lord putting all to the will of our lord / and
considering that there was no remedy to do otherwise / nor to resyst any more
his enmyes / and being constrained on all sides to make the apoyntment / with
great heaviness / inestymable dolours and bewayly^ges / at the last gave his
voice to yield the town (with the treatys or offres to him presented) which
was the.xx. day of December / the year of our lord a thousand five hundredth
and two and twenty.

An abiection to such as will make questyon for the loss and delyuerau^ce of
the cytee of Rodes.
ANd if by any it were object wherefore the said lord great master has
yielded ye town to the great Turk / demau^dynge it with treaty and couenau^tes /
which was a sign that he feared and would no more fight / but go his way. To
this I answer. Notwithstanding y^ the great Turk was aduertysed by some
treatours / and by other y^ fled to ye camp / that y^ powders almoost failed
/ and that there was but few me^ of war wtin the town / yet he believed not
nor gave credence of all yt was reported to him / but thought verily yt we had
enough for a great while. And considered y^ he must tarry till they were wasted
and spent / whereto behooved time. And seeing all his estate entered in strange
places / and in lands of his enmyes / and had been there all ready.vi. months
(and not without great danger of his own person). Thinking on ye other side
/ yt taking ye town by assaute he should lose many of his folk. And yet when
he had overcome and won the town / they should fall each upon other in
departing of the buty or pyllage / doubting fynably the hasarde of war. For
these reasones and other yt may be alleged / the great Turk had much lever to
have ye town by composytion and treaty than otherwise. And it suffysed him to
drive his old enmyes out of ye countrees of leuant / and set y^ subjects of
his countries in rest and surety. And we of the town yt knew our weykenesse /
and that we might no more / it seemed better to save somoche small people than
we and they to fall in the woodnes of our enmyes / for otherwise could we not
have done / but tempte god and deyed as in dyspayre.

How the cytee of Rodes was yelden to ye great Turk / and of the ill behauyour
of certain Turks.
BUt to return to our pryncypall. After that the reverend great master had
given his voice to the yeldynge of the town / he sent the said Passyn again
for to bear it to the great Turk. And with him went the two men that were
chosen of the comyns. And they went all three together to ye tent of Acmek
Bacha. To whom the said Passyn fyrs^e made this pyteous answer and
conclusyon to yield the town. Notwithstanding he said the people had ordained
two men among them for to go to the great Turk / to speak of their partyculer
doings / and to have some suerty of their persons / wives / and children / to
the end that it were not done to them / as of those of Bellegrado. The said
Acmek led the three ambassadors toward the great Turk. And when they were
entered in the pauylyon / the said messyre Passyn made the report of his
ambassade to the said lord / and said that the great master yielded him the
town under the promise made of his imperyall mageste with ye treaty promised.
Of the which promise he held him sure and certain / and that he would not do
it at less. Howbeit the people had required him to give them license to go to
his majesty / for to ask some request of him. Than the two cytezyns besought
ye great Turk that he would for surety remoeue his camp fro the town / to
the end that they should have no lettynge nor hurt of their bodies nor goods
/ and that they that would go should go / and that they that would abide still
might be well treated. The great Turk made it to be to said by his truchema^
to messyre Passyn that he accepted the town / and promised again upon his
faith and on his honor to the lord great master that he would keep him that
he had promised / and sent to him by the same Passyn that he should not doubt
of the contrary. And if he had not ships ynow for to carry his people and
their goods that he would let them have of his / and that he would cause to
deliver the artylery that was wont to be in ye ships of relygyon. And as
touching to the request of the people / he said that he would remoeue the
camp. And that they that would abide / let them abide and they should be well
treated / and should pay no try bute in five years / and their children should
not be touched / and who that would go within the said space of five years /
let them go in good time. These words ended our ambassadors took leave of him
And when they were issued / they spoke again with ye said Acmek Bacha for to
have a letter of the contents of the promise of the said lord. And by his
commandment the said letter was made / whereby he promised to let go the
great master with all his knights / strangers and men of the town that
would go with their goods without to have dyspleasure of any of his people of
the camp / or by the ways. when ye letter was made it was delivered to
messyre Passyn. And as towchynge to withdraw the camp the said Bacha promised
again that he would do it / sith the great lord would so. Howbeit he remoeued
but fro the trenches / and some of his people went a little way of. And the
said Bacha demanded in the Turks behalf that they should send to him in
hostage four and twenty knights / whereof two should be of the great cross /
and two and twenty cytezyns. And the said lord should send only a cap^tayne
with three or four hundredth Genyssaires for to keep the town when ye camp
were withdrawn. And so it was done / and beside this he gave a xxi. days of
respyte to the lord great master / to prepare him and depart out of Rodes.
And in conclusyon (...) this done / our ambassadors returned and made the
report to the reuere^de great master of all that he had done and practysed
with the great Turk and the said bacha / and gave him ye lettre for to go
surely. Than ye great master with his tounceyll ordained ye.xxiiii. persons /
and other of ye town. when they were ready they went to ye camp / where they
were well entreated.iiii. days. During this time Ferra bacha passed ye main
land to the camp with.xxiiii. or.xxv.M genyssaires / which by ye commandment
of ye great Turk was gone upon ye bordres of the countries of Sophy. For the
turk seeing ye people of ye camp dyscourage and would no more go to ye
assautes sent to ye said bachas to come to Rodes with his people / which wtstode
sore with their bodies as fresshe men. And it was work of god and evident
miracle yt they came after yt the appoyntement was made. For if they had comen
before it is to suppose yt ye deed had gone otherwise / and there had been many
strokes given / but I believe yt the end should have been piteous for us / but
god would not yt the turk shol^e have vyctory upon us as he ought to have had /
seeing the great auau^tage yt he had in all things / but he blinded hy^ and
would not yt he knew his might. And on ye other part it may be said and
meruayled how it is possible always to have overcome our enmyes in all assautes
and scarmysshes / and at the end to lose ye town / preferrynge the will of
god yt so has pleased for some cause to us unknown. It is to believe ye lack
of men and gonshot / and the enmyes so far wtin the town / and ready to
enter at other places with ye treasons has caused ye town to be lost. Two
or.iii. days after the coming of the said bacha his genissayres and other of
the camp entered in to y^ town which was on Crystmas day / wtin y^ time given
to us / and than the turks word was broken / if it were his will or not I can
not tell. Nevertheless there was no sword drawn / and in yt promysse was
kept. But they made pyllage / and entered by force in to ye houses of ye castle
/ and took all yt they might and would. After yt they had ransaked ye houses
they entered in to the chyrches / and pylled all yt they found / and brake ye
images. And there was no crucyfyx / nor figure of our lady nor of other saints
yt abode hole. Than with a great inhumanyte they went in to ye hospytall of poor
and seek fo^^e called ye fermory / and took all the silver vessel yt seek folk
were served with / and raised them out of their beds and drove them away /
some with great strokes of staves / and some were cast down fro ye galeryes.
when these hou^des had done ye act they went to ye church of saint John^ and
took down to^bes of the great masters / and sought if there were any treasour
with them / and they forced certain women and maidens. And all they yt were
cristned and had been turks before / were they men / women or children / and
children that ye said men had made christian they led in to turkey / which is
greter importau^ce than any of the other. The morrow after Crystmas day ye
reverent lord great master went to the great turks pauyllyon for to vysyte
him / and to be better assured of his promysse. the which lord he made to be
well and gracyously received. And caused to say to him by his trucheman that
the case so happened to hy^ was a thing usual and common / as to lose towns
and lordshippes / and that he should not take over much thonght for it. And as
for his promysse he bade that he should not doubt in any thing. And that he
should not fear any dyspleasure to his person / and that he should go with
his people without fear. With these words ye said lord thanked him and took
his leave and departed.
