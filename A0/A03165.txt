A Balade specifienge partly the manner, partly the matter, in the most
excellent meetyng and like marriage between our Sovereign Lord, and our
Sovereign Lady, the Kings and Queens highness. Pende by John Heywod.
THe egles bird has spread his wings
And from far of, has taken flight
In which mean way by no leurings
On bough or branch this bird would light
Till on the rose, both red and whight
He lights now, most lovingly
And thereto most behouinglie.
The monthe ensuing next to June
This bird, this flower for perch does take
Reioysinglie him self to prune
He rousith, rypelie to awake
Upon this perch to chose his make
Concluding straight for ripe right rest
In the lions boure, to bilde his nest
A bird, a beast to make to choose
Namely the beast most furious
It may seem strange, and so it doose
And to this bird injurious
It semthe a case right curious
To make construction in such sens
As may stand for this birds defens
But mark* this lion so by name
Is properly a lamb tassyne
No lion wild, a lion tame
No rampant lion masculyne
The lamblike lion feminyne
Whose mild meek property aleurth
This bird to light, and him asseurth
The egles bird, the egles air
All other birds far surmounting
The crounid lion, matcheth feyre
Croune unto croune, this bird does bring
A queenelie queen, a kingly king
Thus, like to like here matched is
What match may match more mete the^ this
So meet a match in parentage
So meet a match in dignite
So meet a match in patronage,
So meet match in benignite,
So macht from all malignite
As (thanks to god given for the same)
Seelde has been seen, thus says the fame
This meet met match, at first meeting
In their aproche together near
Loulie lovely lyueli greeting
In each to other, did so appear
That lookers on, al must grant clear
Their usage of such humayne reach
As all might learn, but none could teach
Then in conioyning of these twain
Such sacred solemn solempnite
Such fare in feast to entertayne
Such notable nobilite
Such honor with such honest
Such Joy, all these to plat in plot
Plat them who can, for I can not
But here one deyntie president
Nombre so great, in place so small
Nations so many, so different
So sodenlie met, so agreed all
Without offensive word let fall
Save sight of twain, for whom all met
No one sight there, like this to get
This lamblyke lion, and lamblike burde
To show effect, as cause affordes
For that they lamblike be concurde
The lamb of lambs, the lord of lords
Let us like lambs, as most acordes
Most mekelie thank, in humble wise
As humble heart, may most deuyse
Which thanks full given most thankfully
To prayer fall we on our kneese
That it may like that lord on hie
In health and wealth to prosper these
As falth for their most high degreese
And that all we, their subjects may
Them and their laws, love and obey
And that between these twain and one
The three and one, one once to send
In one to knit us euerichone
And to that one, such mo at end
As his will only shall extend
Grant this good god, adding thie grace
To make us meet tobtayne this case
