The unite and Scisme of the old Church.

Blessed ar the atonmakers studyinge for peace / for they ar the childern of
God. Matthew.v. M.D.XLIII. In June.

Of the unite and Scisme of the old Church.
OWr Lord / being the autour of peace and unite and not of strife and
dissencion / anon from the begininge and from the first calling of his people
the Jews / he most straightly bound them to gither retained into the fellowship
of one body both with laws ecclesiastik and politic. Isa. lvij i. Cor.
xiiij.
For he commanded them to cleave only to the one god / him only to call upon
/ him only to love and worship / yea and that with no another rites nor by
nonother wais then himself had prescribed and taught them he prescribed them
not aftir their own deuyce / not in every place they listed / but in one place
/ at one altar / and that aftir his own prescript laws to sacrifice / and not
any where else to runforthe to strange gods for help / lest they should diuyd
their hertis unto many with helpinge gods or saints as they be now called:
but as they were the members of one body / so to have respect only to one
god / his laws only to observe and fermelye to persevere and abide in unite
and concord of religion. And although this people then being under the Iuges
did often times err and transgress yet abode they in that unite / namely
under Samuel and King David and in the first years of king Solomon his reign.
But that first most ungodly and ambicious herety a Hieroboam dissolved and
broke this ancient entire unite of that chirch / for he did first set up the
Calves to be worshipped in Da^ and Bersaba / inuenting a new religion and a
new worship for god / that is / even a strange worship agenst gods law whereby
himself with his people were alienated from God and his trwe worship / he so
diuidi^g the hertis of the people that they could nether depe^de only nor wait
upon the only one God and his laws / nor yet agree among them selves in any
civil societe. Hieroboa^ the first heretyke. The.iij of the kings ca. xi. and
xij.
For let our faith and religion be once corrupt divided and mixed with men's
dreamed rites / supersticious ceremonies / troublous traditions with armed
Actis and articles / and anon there must nedis follow ciuyle sedicions bataill
and stryfes as ye may see it this day begun. And here by the way / thou shall
know that an heretyk is he that by false doctrine or by defendinge the same /
divides any chirch which was / or is lykelye to be / well instituted. who be
heretykes.
But in these troublous contencions and sedicious strifes the pore miserable
people were then greuouslye tormoiled and tormented until the Lord with the
sword of the Assirions did kutof and made an end (for that time) of their
abominable heresies and scismes / as eue^ now aftir the thrustinge away of the
Gospel graciouslye offced us / there must nedis follow blody bataill and
mutacions of kings and realms as the stories and words of the Bible plainly
declare. For when Princes fear that the word of peace and obedience freely and
purely preached would make mutacion tumulte and sedicions and so for this cause
repress the free course thereof either by puttinge the prechers to silence / by
banisshing them or burning them / then (be they sewer) Quod verebantur / hoc
accidet illis. Job. iij.
That at they feared shall come upon them / the Lord so threatening and
adsewering them saing. For as asmich as this people abhorred the sweet waters
of Silo that flow so still (Silo is the sweet gospel of peace sent us) and has
rather pleasure in this king Rezin and in the sone of Romilus / that is in
their wont wiked Romisshe rites and traditions: Isa. viij
behold / behold says the Lord / I shall cause the mighty flowdes to swel up
and to break in upon them / even the king of the Assirions / whose part
(aftir the way be made for him by the ciuyle batails of the christians emonge
them selves) the great Turk shall play it. Oh Immanuel.

Let this therefore be a warninge in time to all realms christen / wherein
because the very Hieroboams eue^ the counsails of the Bisshops with their
captiued seculare arms have most heretically and scismatykly with their
borrowed seclar swerd kut in sondre the most holy unite and concord of Christ's
church mangled and hacked into so many decent rites and laudable (as they
say) ceremonies etc^ / by burning and banisshing the fre trwe prechers /
holdinge yet fast in their honowr the Popes thorney tradicions and false
religion dividing the peples hertis from god into a thousand wais / works /
worshipings / merits / saints to pray with / or for us (I can not tell
whether) some sent to the Bisshops book for their salvation / some to the Acts
of the perlement to seek out their articles of the Popes faith fathered by
these sedicious Hieroboams counsel upon the King and his Nobles / but none do
they send to the holy Bible / albeit under a colowr it be laid in every
parissh Chirch and the curate which either with an evil will or else can skant
spel it / commanded to read it. Because (I say) these faccious bocherely
Hieroboams have made like division in our chirches / therefore a like sword (if
they repent not in time) abides them to divide their heads from their bodies
and their souls from god. But I return to where I left of. The^ was there yet
left in Judea two trybs which worshipped the Lord at Jerusalem / which people
for all this godly monicion and blody ensample at Israel their neighbors
captyuite / yet did these twe^ trybs haunt still their new gods and a new
wais in worshipping their very God aftir their own devices mixed together with
gods prescripte laws. Wherefore eue^ those same two trybs also / it behooved
into the vengeance taking of their heresy and division (Heresy (I say) is a
scabbe which divides christen chirches) to be kut away with the sword of the
Caldeis. Heresy
For so said the Lord often before by his prophetis. Thus thou see (good
reader) how that stryf and batail follow the division of the unite of chirches
and the corrupcion of religion: which ungodliness / heresies / and scismes / the
sword of the Turk at last must kutte clean away / when our vnientle
Hieroboams will not suffer the sweet sword of gods word peaceably preched to
divide us from owr wiked lyuinge into the unite of one faith only thereby to
be justified / and into one and the same christen religion to be baptized.

From the return out of the Babilonik captivity / for a little space the Jews
were somewhat more religious / perseuering in the unite of the trwe doctrine.
And the^ were there Bishops unto whose cure the doctrine of the trwthe and
unite of the chirch was committed: but aftir that the bisshops neglected the
doctrine and began to study scolde and strive who should bear most rule making
altercacion for crowns / myters / diademes / robes / rochettes / bisshopryks
and I can tell for what wother popissh paludaments or rather very nugaments /
eue^ the very badges of their lordly bysshopryks: The heresies and scismes
aftir the Babilonyk captivity / when bishops ruled.
then at last begane the trwe religion to be shaken in sondrye and scatred /
and evil men were sprongen up / which yet for their shyning hipocrysye seemed
somewhat pope holy / which openly stered up heresies / that is to say / sects
and divisions from the holy tradicion of the law / and in conclusion brought
the people into varye and diverse contrary faccions and scismes Omnia enim
plena fiunt impij (...) vanitas exaltatur inter filios hominu^. And so by their
own tradicions and institucions they derkened and oppressed the holy sacred
religion of god / yea by their hipocrysy and supersticion they utterly so
deformed it / that they made it abominable heresye (as they have now done) and
new lerning to be lothed and detested of all men / In somiche that John Bapt.
and Christ himself now comen / the trwe religion / pure gospel / and the
plain doctrine of the trwthe were skant known / for that they were so utterly
deformed and corrupted (as they be now I say) with mennis vayn tradicions.
This corrupt deformite and abominable corrupcion began about the time of the
Machabeis and so forth increased the years folowinge. For Josephus verily
writing of the Iestes of Ionathas / in the.xiij. book of his Antiquites /
the.viij. chap. says that in the same time there were iij. sects or heresies
emo^ge the Iewis / which sectary or heretical men believed contrary and
^^^ersly of owr iustificacion / of ma^s state and condition: iij. sects before
christ's coming
of which one was the Pharisaikal sect / the the other / the sect of the
Saduceis / and the third the Essenes. For these sects preceded the coming of
Christ into flesh not little less then an.c.xlviij. years / but in their
own opinions / in their habits / and almost in all things / they were first
of all among themselves / and sone aftir from the wother come^ sort / most
diverse and most contrary. And they drew aftir the^ to follow the same their
own folisshe facions very many / in somich that at last even the priests and
full many of the greatest learned descended into their orders and instituts For
we have herdeoute of the testimony of John theuangelist / the Levites and
priests to have been pharisais / yea and the Apostle Paul said himself to have
had been the most straightest follower of the pharisayes sect / so that what
soever was seen to these me^ to be ordined enacted and decreed (as ye see it
now) in things concerning the faith and religion of god / it was decreed
enacted and made so fast of them that noman might say agenst it / and it was
setforthe and given of the priests to all the people for gods law and for his
decrees / and were called the decente rites of their fathers and laudable
traditions of their elders / of which traditions Paul incidently makes mencio^
in the.i. chap. to the Galathia^s / and Mat. in the.xv. chap. Joan. i.
Gala. i.

Phariseis.
rytes and ceremonies aftir their own pleasure inverted seemed aftir their own
corrupt judgment to them selves and to other like / less then other men's
institucio^s to varye from the holy scriptures. Their co^uersacion and outward
living seemed sober abject / and as though they would be little set by / geuinge
themselves to no excess nor to no dilicate superfluite nor superfluous
daintyes. They believed althingis to be carried of fortune / chance / and
destiney (as they call it) but yet in the mea^ ceason free liberty they took
not fro man. These aknowleged the judgment of god / the pains of the evil and
rewards of the good / they confessed the immortalite of souls and the
resurreccion of the bodies. Some say they had their name of phares which
signifies to separate or divide for they showed themselves in their hole habit
and living to be holier then the common people / and so for their pure holiness to
be divided from them (as now of late were / and yet be / owr pharisais) some
then into cloisters / and some yet into collegis / wearing distinct aparel and
shaven crowns from the layite. Some think they had their names of a another
hebrew word which signifies to explane and interpret scripturs / for they
were the chief and most busyest prechers and techers of the people / which
thing I believe the more / because the story of the gospel declares our Lord
often time to have had refuted their false gloses unwritten verites and vntrwe
exposicions / plain examples there are setforth in Mat. v. and.xv. chapt
Forthermore / the Saduceis would apere to keep no another obseruacions besyds the
law of Moses / these gave nothing to fortune and destinye / but to the free
lybertye they attributed althinges. Saduceis.
For they threw althings subject under owr own power / aknowleginge owr own
selves to be the autors of good works. They denied to be any spirits and
angels and the resurreccion of the dead / which thing Luke in the actis of the
apostles shows / and therefore were they estiewed of the pharisais as men most
vile and vnpure / and thus was there perpetual strife betwixt them both.
xxiij. ca
Whereof even the sorry miserable unlearned people was so wrapped and intricated in
their stryffes and diversity of their invented dreamis that not only they
might not unwrap and lose themselves out of these perplex tryfles / but they
were made ignorant of the very right and trwe way of their iustificacion and of
the trwe way of their salvation / which rightwyse making only by faith and
trwe wais of salvation through Christ only / when John Bapt. and christ and
his apostles would repare declare and show them plainly and openly / then they
reputed and took them for siche heinous heretics preching agenst them / that
there was never no kind of doctrine so bitterly refused / unpugned / thrust
from them / and dampened of the pharisais and saduces as was christis holy and
trwe prechinge / in this mischief they consented / although they never agreed
emonge them selves in their doctryn. For never had Christ owr Lord and
christis verite more pernicious enymies (as ye yet see it this day) then the
Pharisais and Saduceis. And as for the Essenes / who so list to see them in
their own lively colors painted / let him look but on a Monk of the charture
house / or a friar obserua^t / whom Plinye paynteth very lively in his first
book of the natural stories ca. xvij. and Josephus in his.xviii. book of
tha^tiquites ca. ij. and in his.ij. book of the Jews batail cap. vij. Essenes.
Now compare the state of their time to owr time and to owr pharisais. Of the
unite and Scisme of christian chirches.
But yet (christian reader) that thou might the clearlyer by comparinge
together / understand this hole cause and matter of the sectis of the Jews /
thowe must know those heresies to be very like the sectis and heresies which
in these last days have been / and yet ar sprongenvp in the church of
christ. Christ with his apostles delivered to us the doctrine of unite / that
is to weit / only health and salvation to be setforth in him only / which
alone is owr iustificacion / holymaker / satisfaccion / even that host once
alone for all offered up for owr sins / owr mediator / intercessor / and to be
short / he alone is unto his faithful chirch althings and in althingis. He
commanded his apostles to glewe together his church by this perfect doctrine of
unite into one body / and by his Baptism and Bread breki^ge to gather the^
together now conseigned and sealed up together / so to seek allthings in
thonely sone of God / that they emonge themselves through love might consent and
godly agree being all one thing in christ / and that there be no dissencions
nor sectis in his chirch / unto no creatures being addict unto none but to
christ her spouse dedicatinge hirself / when nether Paul nor Peter was
crucified for her nor she hirselfe baptized into the names of any men. This
doctrine of unite / those same goodmen which in times past professed and taught
it / and by the same doctrine conserved the unite / the christian chirches held
them for catholyk and faithful / but the adversaries and fyghters agenst this
doctrine and unite they took them for heretics. The catholic and heretyk^.
And so for certain.C. years the chirch was conserved in the euangelik unite
by the godlynes erudicion / and diligent watch of the faithful flockfeders of
christ / whom they called bisshops. But aftirward when these bisshops (this
doctrine of the unite neglected) began to scolde and brawle about (I can not
tell what) tryfles questions of naught / and to bend and apply their
ambicious minds to be lords and occupy kingdom^ / through their satanicall
altercacions and most pestiferous profane ambicion / the doctrine of unite was
smiten out of wynt. For then satisfaccions / wilworks / good deadis / money
and men's merits bought and sold began to be bosted and preched for men to
come to heaven by them / whereby the merit of christis passion was blotted out
of me^nis brestis and me^nis hertis were divided in sondre. Then was it
disputed (as ye have seen it of late in owr parleaments and conuocacions) of
the intercession and prayinge to saints / and of their worshipping (god save it)
and of the veneracion of images and relics / of purgatory / unwritten verites
/ of Kings autorite and power over gods holy everlasting word / of gay
significacions for decent ceremonies and laudable rytes / of preistis vows /
Sacraments / and I can not tell what: and whether they might be sewerlyer
stablisshed by mortal menis transitory new vain acts / then by the old
everlasting word of the ever lyuinge god. Here of lo / ar the hertes of the
faithful thus abstracte from the doctrine of unite / that they seek not
althingis at / and in christ: yea and in those like days of disceptacion
paste / there enfolowed the division of the weste empery from the east / and
that even for the worshipinge of images. The^ the Monks with all the false
religious rableme^t thrusted in them selves which with their dirtye doctrine
confirmed fast this forsaid defeccio^ and ^affall / encreasinge the same with
new addicions and toputtings / and odious ordinances out of their nwne sike
heads deuillisshly dreamed. These mo^strese mo^ks and flatering friars (with
their Poped and Cardinaled holy bisshops and shauelings assisting them)
inverted and carried into the church new fathers / new rules / new vows /
new felowships and false fraternities / new wiked worships / new names /
new Sacraments / new ceremonies rytes traditions / yea and a new god to /
and to be brief / all new and all against the old holy scriptures / so that
if thou wolust seek for the old institucions of God thou shall nowhere in
their new doctrine of division find their propper names / and yet (by your
leave) these Monks with their shaven sort / as they differ and discord in
habit / aparell and in their living / so did they yet never agree among
themselves in their doctrine. For they fight one agenste another / they haat /
they curse and ba^ne each other / but against christ they be all one. The people
follow their faccions / doctrynes and actis made as they lift / and is kut and
divided into more then a thousand peeses. These fryerly flies monkisshe
monsters / and busye blind bishops (their counsel gathered) decree what they
list / and defend it with the seculare sword / then they cause it to be
often in the year red and preched to all the world and received pain of death
/ and with these their own dead dreams ar the miserable mortal men implexed
and masshed / yea and so madded / that as they can not understand their new
strange termed scolastik doctrine and vntrwe theology / so can they not know
the wholesome plain doctryn and trwe divinity of Christ and his apostles. For
whyls they be set of these blind goydes into a thousand wais / by misses / by
vows / by intercession of saints / by pardons / satisfaccions / by and through
purgatory / yeretids / mo^thids / by their own works and other men's merits and
all for money / the pore wretches not knowing christ the very way / nor ones
so hardye to open their lippis / to reason agenst them / but secretly lamenting
their miserable ignorance ar thruste headlo^gs into hell with these their
beastly blind leders. In the mean time if any man come sent from God and
desire the doctryn of unite to be brought in agene preching the old and only
way by Christ / yea if he in any wise dissent from their opinions lately
received of blind fools (for agenst the trwe doctryn as says the prophet they
have coniured and sworen) upon him anon they lay busy wait / and for because
they challenge to themselves the lordly censure and cruel correccion of the
doctrine in the chirch anon they send out enquirours to fetch the^ in to be
prisoned and brent. By these edders spiritual spume the way of the trwthe and
unite is blasphemed: nether ar there this day living more pernicious pestilent
enymyes to the unite of the church and to the christen doctrine then this
serpentyne sead out of whose mouths continuallye the spightfull lothely names
of heretics and heresies and new lerning ar forth vomited and out spewed into
every disshe upon their tables. Through these dronken crownis of Ephraim / by
their own pleasante opinions / by their own consaighted doctrine and sworn
tradicions the trowth of the gospel and of the apostles is obscured and
oppressed daily. Now (good reader) thou see (I think) how properlye the
times before christ's incarnacion / and now this last time before his coming
to judgment agree to gither and be corresponde^t for in either of them /
heretyks and sectesowers did run and preek before him / miserablye kutting
into peeses and pituously polluti^g the church of God. But both of them / the
Lord at his cominge reueleth opens and destroys / and his own church he
reduces into the right way defends and delyuereth it mightily. Now
therefore nedis must the Turk (the way first prepared for him by yowr own
blody persecucion of the just and by intestyn batail) come in and make an end
of these your heresies and scismes. For there is nether Emperowr no^ King that
will yet suffer them / when good occasyon and oportunite was offered them / to
be reformed in their chirches and unite and christen religion to be restored in
their time. Here thou see (good reader) who in the church be had for
faithful / and who for heretikis. Who be faithful and who be heretyks.
Every trwe faithful / is he that professes trwlye the doctrine of unite /
and in the only holy chirch grounded upon christ he only aknowlegeth christ
the very flokfeder and savior / althings reposing into christ / althinges of
christ askinge / and besides christ he knows no part of salvation nor
help or hope of life to be looked for / only of the voice of his shepherde
depending / chosinge nothing out of himself nor out of any man's inuencion to
follow it as a mean to his salvation. But whosoever folowth the contrary / he is an
heretic and a scismatyk / namely if he be incurable and pertinate stiff in
his own false opinion and will not fall from creatures to christ only / from
lies and vain fryuole tradicions with their unsavory significacions fained of
men / unto the trowth and gospel of Jesus Christ / but entyse and wrap other
men with himself into the same errors. Wherfor^ ^oh ye popisshe peace
^^eakers and iewisshe I^^oboams with your ^^^lare aakwarde arms even very
Baalis britle buklers) since hitherto ye have been me^ most mercyles and very
blody bochers conceived (as Isaye paynteth you) betwixt the hoorehunter and
harelot even that same deceitful peruers and aduouterous generation / which so
many years have mustred (mynistred I should say) in the church so
pestelently: Isa. lvij
and yet nether for the fear of god nor for dread of your dampnacio^ nor for
shame of me^ will not repent and amend / I cannot meruell enough at your
blind securite / nothing remembering nor fearing the wrath of god ha^ging over
your heads / nothing entendi^g to avoid it. Oh heretyks / which through your
hypocrisye feign in your selves siche holiness / be sewer God looks openly upon
your mischief and ungodly life. An exhortacion unto our bisshops.
Repent / repent you / aknowlege openly your manifest crimes / for though ye
believe it not / yet all the world se them / be ye turned unto god which for
your faith in his sone Jesus will freely forgive you / be ye converted to him in
the holy amendment of your hole lives at the squire of gods law. Show forth
(I say) your trwe penance in your wordis and works / tell it us once in all
your conversation / and not with lying lyppes / and the^ we shall take you
no more for dissembling hypocryts thus to write agenst you that all the world
present and to come may see you and bewar of you. Do penance for the fear of
our lord out of a sincere heart. Remember the excellent oracio^ and sermon
that John Bapt. had to your p^decessors / saying. Who shall show you (oh edders
whelps) to avoid the wrath of god coming upon / do therefore the fruits seminge
and as it becomes trwe penitente hertes. Lo / John was not affrayd to tell
eue^ the high bishops in estimacion of all men most holiest / the trwe
precher of christ dirst tell king Herod his open crime to his own face /
where be now owr flaterers of kings into the destruction of their bodies and
souls and into the perdicio^ of their realms? John called them edders whelps
/ Christ called Herod that fox / we must say my Lord and it please your
grace / your high majesty etc^. And Christ inueying agenste them / cried woe /
woe be to you learned in the law ye scribes and pharisais hypocryts which
build the sepulcres of the prophets and so forth. Math. xiij.
And John bapt. told them that the axe was vent to smytdown the tree to be
straitewais cast into the fire. And here incidently shall ye ^iepers.
know the nature of viepers / whose whelps John Bapt. and Christ call these
owr pharisaical Hieroboa^s. Math. iij. and xij.
The male of the vieper puts his head into his mates mouth / which for the
swetnes she feleth therein / byteth it of / which head is turned into eggs /
and the third day out of these eggis ar hatched her whelps yet abidinge in
her belie / then eftsone she puts forth every day one whelpe till they come
to the nombre of.xx. Plinye in his.x Book cap. lxij
And at last the impacie^t fierce residew which cannot tarry there any longer
/ gnawe themselves out of the bellye of their own damme or mother / whom by
their birth they kill. Right worthily / says Chrisostom / did Joan call the
pharisais viepers whelps / for these kind of serpents so swiftlye do they
haast themselves to slaye their own mother that the belly in who^ they be borne
eaten out / they will comeforth into light by the death of their own damme.
Which even the same do owr pharisais / for their handis dropinge the blood of
their parents / yet e^brewed with innocent blood / they slaye the^ which are
sent of god to lead the^ into the light of the verite. Wherefore well may we
lay agenste them their own blody crueltye / rebellion / impiete chorlissh
ingratitude / the hatered of gods word and the murtheringe of the faithful
prechers: as who should say of them: ye be borne out of rebel / ingrate and
blodye pare^tis whose wiked steapes like natural childerne ye justly follow.
And when Joan and Christ called them edders whelps / they looked bake to the
serpente and his sead bringing Adam and Eve unto everlasting dampnacion which
should evermore fight agenste the blessed sead and his members. Gen^. iij
Wherefore the Lord himself / cried / woe / woe be to you scribes and pharisais
hypocrites that ye be / which build the sepulcres of the prophets etc^.
Math. xxiij.
And as for foxes / into whose meat they shall be kutte / as their selves have

Be they never so divided emonge themselves / yet agenst the Lord and his

Here may ye see by christis and Ioans ensamples to be lawful for prechers
sharply to rebuke great men's open crimes: Great mennis crimes must be openly
rebuked.
but to flater and dissemble with them it is not lawefull. Away therefore with
these flateringe ypocrites which cry out saing. The crimes and sins of great
men and noble prelates must be kouered with Noes cloak Gene^. ix. For in the
scriptures it is inueyed of gods own spirit more vehemenly and sharplier
agenst the evil prelates and worse heads over the people the^ agenst the sely
subjects. For these simpilons err not utterly of their own fault / but by
the evil ensamples and synful techinge of their prelates and naughty living of
their rulers and magistrates which seduce the lay people of the Lord.
Wherefore the more sin steketh in the^ the more grievously to be tormented / as
ye may see it in the.vi. chapter of the book of Wisdom / which would god the
Magistratis would with fear lay before their eyes. Ye see now in this time
verily how that by the beastlye idleness / malice and ungodliness of the bisshops
preistes and seclare monks with the negligence of their captiued seclare sort
/ the church of Christ erreth and strayethe far from the way of the trwthe
grievously laboring in heuye pains oppressed of tyranous persecutors: and
through the fault of these men chiefly / Peter's pore little fysshinge bote is
almost overwhelmed with the terrible tempestuous soden sourges. Right well
therefore do they which plucking the visar from their faces / show their
abhominacion to the people sharplye rebukinge their ungodliness / that these
ypocrits once known / me^ may be war of them and their doctrine. How the
prelates and Magistrates should be rebuked.
Rebuke the^ therefore for the zele thou have to the trwth to the glory of god
and to thy brothers salvation. And let thy liberty in speking be the liberty
of the free benign spirit / and rebuke not of malice aftir the fleshly license
of thy nown affected mind. Let the wordis and wrytingis of the ministers of
the trwthe be prudent rather then bold / grave and not light ardent not in ire
and wrath but in the vehemence of the spirit of god / let them be shamfaste
modeste in a just seuerite tempred with holy devotion and devout holiness so
long as thou see them not in a desperate state obstinatly and openly
stifnecked agenste gods word fyghting / wetingly to sin agenst the holy
ghost. But yet be thou (as Christ ordined the) the salt of the earth / that
is / let thy words be quik lively and sharp in thy sermons and ernest in thy
rebukis / be salt sauory and no waterisshe beet. Mat. v
For constancy and liberty in speking conciliateth and joins autorite to the

Tell them that god is no slow auenger of evil / he is no insensible stock
but as full of eyes as Argos and as clear eyed as the lysarde or slow worm
presentlye and thorowlye beholding them. Pharisais Hypocrites and Epicures
promise the^seues securite and long life / but tell thou them with Joan bapt.
that the axe is now laid to the tree root. Which present wrath the Lord in
Luke expresses sainge. Woe be to women with child and to the soukgeuers with
their nieples in these days / for there shall be great affliccio^ upon the earth
and wrath upon this people. For they shall be smite^down with the edge of the
sword / and shall be led captive into among all the strange nations. And
Jerusalem / that is they that are now named christians shall be trode^down of the
heithen Turks. Let us now therefore in time (christen brethren) fere the lord
and walk in his precepts / not promising ourselves any securite or long life
in this our corrupcion and sins / for God owr just judge is awake. This
therefore is my cownsell / even to do penance / that is turn quiklye and
ernestly unto owr Lord God / and to confess our sins to him / amend owr
lives and to serve him in holiness and rightwisnes / for these ar the fruits of
a repentant heart / which heart through faith has now trwly consecrated and
given herself over wholl to god. The way instituted of God to move us to
repentance.


But first let us take away the impedime^ts of trwe repentance / as ar
securite of long life the opinion of owr own ryghtwysnes by good workis /
faith and trust in vain lies etc^. And then teache nothing else to be in owr
selves but poison sin and corrupcio^ / and that in god only we have life and
salvation which is not apeaced with externe worshipings and works dreamed out
of owr own headis. Then thonderforthe the fear of the terrible judgment of
god at hand and his present wrath and indignacion redye to be powered down from
heaven upon all unright wysnes. If these things be taught and received and the
wother impediments removed / we be sone converted to god only / worki^g the
very godly repentance in the fere of god / or else is the axe layid to the root
of the tree / that is to say / destruction and death daunse p^sent before thy
door / so that now there is no hope to the of any longer life. For aslonge as
there is any hope of fruit in trees / they dunge the roots / rubof the moss /
kutof the sere branches / but it is the token of the last desperacion of any
fruit when the axe is laid to the root / to the root he says and not to the
body or branches / signifying a soden remediles downfall. For the root kutt in
sondre / the tree is dead. Repent ye therefore and receive the gospel / or else
stretcheforthe your neckis unto the axe bent over your heads. For this is
sewer that the wrath of the lord which shall smite you down by the rootis
ha^geth over your shaven crowns. For every tree that bringethe not forth good
fruit is kut down. He says not / shall be kutdowne / for his judgment and
dampnacio^ to present. We be trees planted of the Lord into this end / eue^
to bear and bringforth good fruit / that is good workis / yea and that by the
heavenly iewce and moister of owr Lord Christ. These ar the fruits of the
spirit / as faith and trwth etc^ / of the which aftir Isaye had written / Paul
often times repete the same namely to the Galathens to the Ephe. etc^. Isay. v.

Unto this place lay the.xiij. of Luke and.xv. of Joan and thou haste a plain
exposicion thereof. Of all these wordis may we learn the very trwe good workis
to be required of every of us / and not fig leaves of our own patching
together to kouer our shamful nakedness as did Adam and Eve / not the glittering
show of godliness / but eue^ godliness innocence and christen religion in ded.
Again we learn hereof the heuye vengeance of god to be ready prepared for all
sinful ungodly men / yea and that the most certain ve^gea^ce and wrath / left
any man dirst promise himself to escape unpunished for the contempt of the
most high God. Longsuffering douteles is the lord / but yet in the mean ceason
he is rightwyse and an aduenger not ouerflowe nor to slak. And now to warn
the in time / here haste thou which is trwe repentance and which is false: and
how we may avoid the imminente plages to be cast upon us by the incursions of
the Turks with wother plages imminent / that is if from the botome of our
hertie we be converted unto the Lord amending owr corrupt manners / nothing
douting of the mercy of our god. For this is once full of counforte / that
christ came to call sinners to repentance and not the^ that seemed just in
their own eyes. The pharisais / scrybes / and saduceis as ar now owr
antichriste^ spiritualte with their captiued seculare / were the most desperate
ungodly as Christ and Joan bapt. well knew them / and yet they both / exhorted
them to repentance / Christ called them to him promising them forgeuenes if
their penance were trwe. Let us not therefore despeire of forgeuenes / nor
castawaye and condemn a man never so sinful and cryminous except his sin
be unto death. i Ioa^ in the last chapt.
For God our father is Ientle and of an infinite mercy constante and trwe of
his promises as ye see in Iere. and Ezechie. xviij. chap. At last that thou
maiste know what is trwe repentance and to stere the there unto / let this be
the diffinicion thereof. Repentance or penance is a turning or conversion unto
the Lord god / whereby we / of the sincere fear of god humbled / aknowelege
our sins / and all our whole life we make new. Penance what it is.
This diffinicio^ has certain chief principals / out of the which / the hole
nature of penance shall be fullier expressed and known. First thou hear it
called a turninge / and because it is not a turninge to what soever dead
satisfaccio^ or creature thou lyftest / therefore is it added unto the lord god
/ for so redest thou it in Ieremye. Israel / if thou will be returned / be
returned unto me / says the Lord. The turning to God.
Here is excluded all turnings to saintis and to any wother creature / agene /
here is included the turning away from lies from the devil and the turning to
the trwth. Where it is plain that here it behooves to have the doctrine of
trwth which must show us who is god to whom we must be converted / what is
good and trwe / to the which we must be turned / and what is evil and false
from which we ought to be auerted / and to be brief what must be amended and
how. For this cause the prophetis and apostles exhortinge men to penance /
long and miche do cleave / tarry / and labor in the descripcio^ of the nature
of god / in his goodness rightwysnes verite and mercy / in describinge the laws
to live well and in the offices of men / and also in the sins of men to be
accused opened and exaggered or throne upon heaps as thus to be showed many and
grievous / then they throwto threateninge and menacings laid before their eyes
with the terrible and horrible sight of the judgment of god to be at hand: in
which all / the sincere fear of god (the spirit of god workinge together in
owr hertes) is stered up / so that now with reverence we fear god justly being
a^gry with us / which ar verily alto corrupted / yea we be not else then the
stinking canell and sinful sink of all sin and mischief. the fear of god.
But this fear of god whereof we here speak is called sincere into the
difference of that fear which casts down into desperacion. For sincere fear
/ out of herself brings forth even the very true offices and dedis of
repentance / namely the confession and aknowleginge of sins. Nether is it
enoughe to have herd thy self to be a sinner and god to be angry with the /
unless thou confessest thyself to be eue^ siche one and offcest up thy self
standing before god in judgment / that is to say unless thyself now humbled
before god in his pre^^nce diffidest and distrustest thy nown rightwysnes The
confession of sins and humiliacion.
which thou see to be the most corrupt / and aknowlegest thyself to be eue^
the very most bond man of sin and death. This confession of sins and
humbling of thyself Jeremy requiring / in his.viij. chap. says. There was not
one that repented him of his evil doing saing. What have I done? But this
aknowleging of thy sins has a sorrow and heuines annexed / for the trwe
repenters sorrow and lament that ever they have offended so benign and ientle a
father / and that they have committed so grievous sins which could not be
forgeuen but by the bloudsheding of his (...) sone so innocente a lombe.
Heaviness.
Now may thy heart bl^^d for thy sins beholden in the death and bloudye
woundis of christ. Here here does this sorrowful heuines / this aknowleging /
and humbled heart / express the fre^ confession of thy sins and the humble
askinge forgeu^nes of thy trespassis. And now forber^^se Repentance is the
conversion unto god and not the turning away from him / therefore has this
humiliacion and confession now a great ma^ly faith and a large hope. The
confession of sin with faith and hope.
For this sinner thu^ confessing casts and gives himself over into the
mercy of god / and down upon his knees he asks mekely forgeuenes of him whom
he now accouraged and e^struct with the promises of god / dowteth not to be
merciful to all siche confessors. On this manner every where in the Psalms
the penite^tes so pray that every man might see both to confess and express
their faith and to trust also in the trowth and rightwysmakinge of god through
christ. For penance with owte faith first beholdinge christ's passion is of
none effect / but pernicious and deadlye / as it apereth in the penance of
Judas / whereof Paul speaks thus. False penance
The heuines which is godly aftir gods will / that brings forth holsom
repentance never to be repented: ij. Cor. vij.
but contrary / the worldly heuines brings death: and thus therefore we
conclude. Penance to be the conversion unto god / whereby we out of the sincere
fear of god humkled / a knowledge and confess owr sins never to be committed
again. Now there folowth the the other chief principal belongi^g to penance /
which is the innouacion of thy wholl life. The innouacio^ of thy life.
They verily which fear god and have felt his iugements and mercy / may not
make a light thing nor little regard their sins unto the which they have
hitherto married themselves but they know that they must utterly abhor and
deteste them / occupyinge themselves most holely in godly thoughtis words and
works / before althings fighting all their lives king agenst the world the
devil and their fles^he For penance is not the work of a few days / but the
perpetual custody of the life and the everlasting study to live innoce^tly.
Also the works done of the penitent and of the new lyuers ar called the fruits
of penance / and works worthei penance / of which / chiefly ar the mortyfying
of the flesh and the study to live vertuouslye / the batail with sins /
watch / fasting / prayer / alms / patience / abstine^ce with like fruits of
the spirit. The fruits of penance.
Paul nowmbri^g like work^ of true penance says. ij. Cor. vij.
This work eue^ to be heuey and sorrowful as god asks it how great care has
it brought forth? yea what a satisfaccio^? indignacio^ and displeasure? what
zele? what fear? desire? and vengeance? First lo penance or the heuines
conceived of the holy ghost begets in you (says he) care / that is the
study and most careful cure and dilligent head taking lest ye be polluted again
with those filthinesses from which by the grace of god ye be pourged / the^ he
adds / that this godly heuines begets Satisfaccio^ / that is the
excusacio^ or cle^sing from syn: Godly heaviness what fruit it bri^geth forth.
for so mich signifies the greek word Apologia / which Paul there uses /
adding thereto. Every where ye have gotten yourselues praise because ye be pure
in this behalf. The^ there folowth Indignacio^ / that is the very vehement
wrath and displeasure to yourselues for your crime committed and for your most
shameless filthiness / for with repe^ta^ce / owr own shame begineth: unto the
which / fear is joined / eue^ the continual fear of god. For the neglecting
and little regarding of god is the cause of miche abhominacio^. Also there
folowth desire / which co^teineth loving promisessis to do good / and an
erneste fervor to godward / whereof David speking says. As the hunted heart
desyereth the fresshe waters so desyereth my soul my living god. There is added
/ zele / that is an arde^t study and imitacion to attayn and set hold upon the
most honest wais of living. At last the^e stands ve^gea^ce / for he that thus
is displesed with himself and punissheth his body mortifying it for his sins
/ that man verily scourges his body being aue^ged thereof for so boldly and
prowdely resisting the spirit of god fyghtinge agenst his flesh. Thismiche
have thou of the nature of Repentance / which thou may well diuyde into open
and private penance /. Open penance is openly received for open sins / as to
be smite^ openly with manifest famine / pestelence or batail / of which thou
have an elega^t example Jonas.iij. and Ioele.ij. and in diverse other places of
the holy scripturs. Private penance is that at every man receives of his own
mind the holy ghost so / to do / excitinge him whereby the word of trweth herd
/ the heart is pricked with remorse for his secret and open sins to / which
he lamenting co^uertethe unto God: of this penance / many right fayer and
holy ensamples ye have in the old and new Testamente / but cheiflye of
David.ij. Reg. xij. of Achab. iij. of Kingis xxi. of Manasses.ij. para. xxxiij.
of Matthew Mat. ix. of the sinful woman Luke.vij. of Zachey Luke.xix. of Peter
Mat. xxvi. and Joan.xxi. and of the Jews Act. ij.

Of the penance / confession / and fond fassions of satisf^ccions / which
aftir the time of the Apostles / about the time of Cypriane and Council of
Nece and so following some fathers did thruste into their chirchis / I will not
here greatly reason ne write / because I am full assewered / the doctrine of
the apostles / to be perfect enoughe / so that whosoever will walk aftir their
lantern he shall walk in the sufficient light and not in derkenes. Now at
last / as ye see Baptism to go before the Lords Souper / so see ye sin to
precede Penance and both the sacraments / Paul exhorting eueryman to prove and
examyn himself ere he eat of this bread and drink of this cup / which
text how wic^edly the Bisshops have translated in their book in the.xxxix lefe
all men may see it. i. cor. xi
Also sin precedeth Baptism / for we be conceived and borne in sin / and
who would be wasshen except he were foul? Who repent but siche as see their
sins and their wholl nature and life to be all corrupt bringinge forth out^
^f their own breast the most corrupt fruits? even manifold mischief /
infinite crimes and poison / for the which God is not with out cause angrye
and may make us bond men unto death and eternal dampnacion / unless we open
owr eyes and behold owr sins wasshen away in Christ's blood / buried in the
holes of his deape wounds / therewith also beholding the merciful clemencye of
owre father which for his infinite mercy will not suffer sorye sinners to be
lost / but rather to be converted from evil to good / himself being now
apeaced with us only for Christ's sake (if we so believe it) never to impute
nor twite us by owr sins / but he forgeueth us quiet settinge them as far
from us as is the
