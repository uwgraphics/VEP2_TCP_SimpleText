altered printer's device of Robert Wyer (1529-60) with his name, the eagle,
and part of the foreground cut away, perhaps to represent St. Bernard, the
supposed author of the Golden Pistle, composing that letter (instead of St.
John writing the Book of Revelation on Patmos)

The Prologue.
A Good / wholesome lesson and profitable unto all chrystianes / ascrybed unto
saint Bernarde / and put among his warkes (I think) by some good man that
would it should thereby have the more authorite / and the rather be read and
better be borne away. For doubtless it is a good matter: and edificatyue unto all
them that have a zele / and cure unto soul health and desire of salvation. It
is called in the title. Notabile docume^tum: that is to say / a notable lesson.
And some do call it the golden pystle It follows immediately after a little
work called Formula honest vite. The form and manner of an honest life / or
of honest living.

Vf you intend to please god / and would obtain grace to fulfill the same /
two things ben unto you very necessary. The first. You must withdraw your
mind from all wordly and transytory things / in such manner / as though you
cared not whether any such things were in this world or no. The second is
that you give and apply your self so wholly to god / and have your self in
such a wait / that you never do / say / nethynke / that you know suppose /
or believe should offe^de or dysplease god / for by this mean / you may sonest
and most redely obtain / and win his favor and grace. In all things esteem
and acou^t your self most vile / and most simple / and as very naught in
respect / and regard of virtue and think / suppose / and believe that all
persons ben good / and better than you be / for so shall you much please our
lord. What so ever youse / or seem to pceyue / in any person / or yet here of
any christyane / take you none occasyon therein / but rather ascrybe / and
apply you all unto the best / and think or suppose / all is done or said for
a good intent / or purpose / though it seem contrary. For man's suspycyons and
light iudgemetes ben soon / and lightly deceived / or begyled. Dysplease no
person wyllyngly. He ever speak evil of any person / though it were never so
true that you say. For it is not lawful to she we in co^fessyo^ the vice / or
defaute of any person / except ye might other wise she we and declare your
own offense. Speak little or naught unto your propre / and self laud / or
praise though it were true / and unto your famylyer fellow / or faithful
friend. But study to keep secret / and pryney your virtue / rather than your
vice. Yet were it a cruel deed for any persons to defame them self. Be more
glad to give your ear / and herynge unto the praise / rather than unto the
dysprayse of any pson. And ever beware as well of herynge / as speaking of
detraccyo^. And when you speak take good delyberacto^ / and have few words /
and set those be true and good? sadly set and wisely ordered. If any words be
spoken unto you of vice / or vanyte (as soon as you may) break of and leave
that talk / or co^munycacyon. And ever return / and apply your self unto
some appointed good and godly occupacyon / bodily or ghostly. If any sudden
chance fall or hap unto you / or unto any of youres / leyne not to lightly
there unto / ne care much therefore. If it be of prosperyte / rejoice not much
there in / ne be over glad thereof. If it be aduersyte / be not ouercast / or
overthrown therewith / ne brought to sorrow / or sadness / thank god of all /
and set little thereby. Repute all things transytorye: as of little price or
valor. Give ever most thought and care unto those things / that may profit
and promote the soul. Fle / and avoid the persons and places of much
speech: for better is to keep silence than to speak. Keep the times and places
of scylence precysely / so that you speak not without reasonable and unfeigned
cause. The times of scyle^ce in religyon ben these. From collacion unto mass
be ended after the hour of terce. From the first grace in the fraytour / unto
the end of the latter grace. And from the beginning of even song / unto
grace be ended after souper / or else Bn^dicite / after the common beuer. The
places of silence ben the church and the cloustre / the fraytour and the
dortour. If you be sclaundred / and do take occasyon at that fault / or offense
of any person / than look well upon your self / whether you be in the same
defaute sometime your self / and than have compassyon upon your brother / or
sister. If there be none such defaute in you / think verily and believe there
may be / and than do as (in like) you would be done unto. And thus as in a glass
/ ye may se and behold your self. Grudge not ne complain upon any person for
any manner cause / except you se and perceive by large conjecture that you may
profit and edyfye thereby. Another deny nor affirm your mind or opinion
styfly or extremely / but that your affyrmacyon / denegacyon / or doubt / be
ever powderyd with salt / that is to say / wisdom / dyscrecyon / and pacyence.
Dse not in any wise to mock / check or scorn / ne yet to laughe or smyle but
right seldom. And that always to she we reverence or loving manner / light
countenance / or loud behauyour becomes not a sad person. Let your
co^munycacyon be short and with few persons / al^^^ of virtue / lernyng or
good and chrystiane edysycacion / and ever with such warenes that no person in
things doubtful may take any authoryte of your words / or sentence.

Let all your pastyme be spended in bodily labors good and profitable / or
ellyes godly in study / or that passes all / in holy and devout prayer. So
that the heart and mind be occup^^d with the same you speak. And wha^ you
p^^ye for any certain persons / remember their desire / state and condycyon.
For a form and o^dre of your prayer / this may be a good and ready way. To
follow the order of the.vi. gra^matycall cases. The nominatyue / the genityue /
the datyue / the accusatyue / the vocatyue / and ablatyue. The nominatyue /
that is first to pray foryour self that you may have ghostly strength and
co^sta^cy / that you not fall in to any deedly offense by fraylte. And the.ii.
that you may have right knowledge of god by faith and of your self / by due
consyderacio^ of your astate / and condycyon / and of the laws of god / for
your conyte and contynuatice. And thyrdely that you may have grace and good
will according unto the same strength / and knowledge / and that having unto
god a reuere^de dread you never offe^de him in thought word / nor deed: but
that you may ever love him for him self and all his creatures in oue order
for him and in him. The second is the genytyue case. Then must you pray for
your genytoures / your progenytoures / and parents / that is to say / your
fathers / your mothers spyrytual and carnal: as your ghostly fathers / or
spyrytuall souereynes: your god father / your godmothers. Your natural father
and mother. Your grau^dfathers and grau^dmothers. your brethers and systers /
and all your kynne.

In the third pleace is the datyue case. There must you pray for benefactours
/ good doers / of whom you have received any manner of gyfts spyrytuall or
temporal unto the wealth of your soul and body. In the.iiii. place is the
accusatyue case / where you should pray for your enemies / such psones as by
any means have noyed / hurt or greuyd you either ghostly or bodily: that is to
say / in your soul / or manners by any suggestyon / intysynge / evil
counsel / or evil example. In your fame / or good name / by detraccyon / back
bytynge / or sclaundrynge / or yet by famylyer company. For a person co^munely
is reputed / and supposed to be of such condition as they ben with whom he
has conuersacyon and company. And for them that have hurt your body either by
strokes / or by any other accasyon / have hyndred the state / and health
thereof. And like wise of your worldly gooded / or possessions. For all these
manner of enemies must you pray / that o^r lord god would forgive them as you
do / and as you forgyuen would be / and that they may come to right charity and
peace. The.v. (...) is called the vocatyue: that is to say the c^llyng case /
where you conuenye^tly may call / (...) / and pray unto our lord for all manner
of ^ersones that been out of the state of grace / ^her by i^fidelyte as turks /
Sarasens and (...) other. Or else by error as all manner of (...) heretykes / or
else by any deedly sin or offense to god. Pray foral these manner of persons
that they may come to the right way of their salvation. In the.vi. and last
place / is the ablatyue case. where you must pray for all them that be taken
out of this life / and that dyed or passed the same life in charity / and that
now have need of prayer. In the which you may keep a form of the same order
that is before / that is to say. Instead of the nominatyue where you prayed
for your self: you may now pray for all those that do bide in pain for any
defaute or offense done by your example or occasion. And for the genityue in
the second place / for your parents / and all your kynne departed this life.
And in the.iii. place / for the datyue: pray for your benefactours passed. And
for the accusatyue i^ the.iiii. place / you may pray for them that live in
pain for any occasyon / or any example that they gave unto you. And in the.v.
place / for the vocatyue. Pray for all them that have greatest pains in
purgatory and leest help here by the suffrage of prayers. And for the ablatyue
in the.vi. and last place. Pray you for all souls in general. And that you
may be the more apt to pray / call three things often times unto remembrance /
that is to say. what you have been / what you be / and what you shall be. First
by Rotable les. reason of your body: you were conceived of the most fylthy
abomynable matter of man / shameful to be spoken / fetre more vile then the
sluche / or slyme of the earth / and after borne in a sinful soul / and
purged only by grace. And now (as unto the body) you ben a mukhepe or donghyll
/ more vile than any upon earth. if you remember what does issue daily and
come forth / out of the meats of your body. And your soul is daily in some
sin: or (at the least) full like to be. what you shall be as unto your body:
you may se in experyece: worms meat and earth again. And what shall become
of your soul: no man in this world can assure you. To remember than the loyes
of heaven / and pains of hell and that both ben insimte endless / and without
rebate / but both ever encreasynge and never ceasing / never have ease nor
rest / but ever continue and ever lastyng. To remember than: I say / these
things / may greatly move you to have your self in good a wait / and study
how ye may avoid the one and obtain the other. Reme^brynge spectally how
great a loss it is to lose heaven / and how vnconfortable gaynes to win hell
/ and how soon / and how lightly either of them may be gotten or lost. wha^ any
thing than of aduersyte / hurt / or dyspleasure fortune / or fall unto you:
think than or ymagyn that if you were in hell / you should have the same
dyspleasure and many worse. And so to avoid those: you shall here (the better)
suffer / and for our lord the more pacyently bear al these that now be present
or may come here after. And in like manner / if any good prosperyte or /
pleasure hap or come unto you: think then that if you were in heaven / you
should have that pleasure / and many more excellentioyes. And so for the
fervent desire of those joys: you shall set little by any wordly conforte or
pleasure. A good contemplacyon therefore may it be unto you in feestes of holy
saints (you may i^ the English Martyloge breuely se the lives of many
saints for every day in the year) to think and record how great pains
they suffered here for the love of out lord / and how short these were / and
how soon passed / and then again / how meruaylous reward they had therefore
in joy and bliss everlasting. So the troubles and torments of good
persons: ben soon / and shortly gone and ended. And the joys and pleasures
of sinful persons done soon fade and fle for ever. The good psones / for
their troubles suffered here upon earth: done get and win eterne and
everlasting glory / which the evil persons done lose. And contrary these
evil and sinful persons / for their joy and pleasures here / done reygne by
exchau^ge eterne and everlasting shame / and rebuke with pain / and woe
vnspecable. when so ever than you ben dysposed to slugysnes / or to be drowsy /
remysse in prayer or dull in devotion: than take this little work / or some
other good treatye / and read thetin / and ever note well the contents there of
/ and also what is meant thereby. And if you be not thereby delivered or eased
thereof / than shyfte unto some other work / or occupacyon / so that ever ye
avoid ydlenes / and all vayn pastymes / which in deed ben losetyme. And than
remember that those that now bide in pain / either in hell / or yet in
purgatory for such times so passed or lost / had lever tha^ all the world /
have such time to redeem their pains by / as you may have if you will. Time
than unto all persons well occupied is very precious and dear. Beware well
therefore: how you spend it / or pass it. For you can never revoke it / nor
call it back. if the time pass you by trouble / and vexacyon / think they
ben happy / and gracious that been past thee wretched life / and now i^ bliss /
for they shall never have any such mysery. And when you feel a conforte or
consolacyon spyrytual / thank god thereof / and think the dampened souls shall
never have any such pleasure. And thue let this be for your exercise in the
datyue. At night when you go to rest / first make a count with your self /
and remember how you have spend / or passed that day and time / that was
given you to be used in virtue / and how that you have bestowed your thoughts
/ your words / and your works.

And if you find no great thing amysse / give the whole laud and praise unto
our forde god. And if you perceive contrary / that you have mysspended any
part thereof / be sorry therefore / and beseech our lord of mercy and forgyuenes
/ and promise and verily purpose to make amends the next day. And if you have
portunyte there upon it / shall be full conuenyent for you to be confessed on the
next morrow. And specially if the matter done / said or thought by delyberate
consent / do grievously wey and work with a grudge in your conscience: than
would Iaduyse you never to ete nor drink / till you be dyscharged thereof / if
you may conuenyently get a ghostly father. Now for a conclusyon of this work
/ put before you / as by case or ymagynacyon.ii. large cytyes / one full of
trouble / turmoyle / and myserye / and let that be hall. The other cite full of
joy / gladness / conforte / and pleasure / and set that be heaven. Look well on
them both / for in both be many dwellers / and great company. Then cast and
think within your self what thige here might so please you that you should
choose the worse cite / or what thing should dusplease you on the other part /
whereby you should withdra we your self from that virtue that might counay and
bring you unto the other cite. And when you have studied well here upon and
can no thing find / I dare well assure you if you keep well the precepts and
counseyles of this little lesson / you shall find the right way / for the holy
ghost will instruct and teache you where you be not suffycient of your self /
so you endeuoyre and give dyfygence / to bear a way and to follow that here is
taught. Read it every weke ones or twyse / or oftener if you will. And where
you profit give thanks / laud / and praise unto our lord god / and most
sweet savior Ihesu christ / who send you his mercy and grace / that always
lives god. In secula seculorum. Amen.

Finis.
This was brought unto me in English of an old translacyon / rughe / and
rude / and required to amend it. I thought less labor to write new the
whole / and I have done unto the sentence not very nere the letter / and in
diverse places added some things following upon the same to make the matter more
sentencyoue / and full. I beseech you take all unto the best / and pray for the
old wretched brother of Syon Richard whytforde.
