There Is nothing to be had without money, OR He that brings money in his hand
Is sure to speed by sea or land,
But he that has no coin in's purse
His fortune is a great deal worse,
Then happy are they that always have
A penny in purse their credit to save.

To a new Northern tune, Or the Mother beguiled the Daughter.


YOu gallants and you swagring blades
Give care unto my ditty,
I am a boon companion known
In country, town, and city,
I always loved to wear good clothes,
And ever scorned to take blows,
I am beloved of all me knows,
But god a mercy penny.
My father was a man well known
That used to hoard up money,
His bags of gold he said to him
More sweeter were than bony,
But I his son will let it sly,
In tavern, or in ordinary,
I am beloved in company,
But god a mercy penny.
All sorts of men both far and near
Where ever I resorted,
My fellowship esteemed dear,
Because I was reported
To be a man of noted fame,
Some said I well deserved the same,
Thus have I got a gallant name,
But god a mercy penny.
All parts of London I have tried
Where merchants wares are plenty,
The Royal Exchange and fair cheapeside
With speeches fine and dainty,
They bring me in for to behold
Their shops of silver and of gold,
There might I choose what wares I would
But god a mercy penny.
For my contentment once a day
I walked for recreation,
Through Paul's, Ludgate, and Fleet Street gay.
To raise an elevation:
Sometimes my humor is to range,
To Temple, Strand, and new Exchange
To see their fashions rare and strange;
But god a mercy penny.
I have been in Westminster hall
Where learned lawyers plead,
And shown my bill among them all
Which when they see and read,
My action quickly has been tried
No party there my suit divide,
Each one spoke bravely on my side;
But god a mercy penny.
The second part. To the same tune.


THe famous abbey I have seen
And have the pictures viewed,
Of many a noble king and Queen
Which are by death subdued,
And having seen the sights most rare,
The water men full ready were
Mm^s ore the river of Thames To hear;
But god a mercy penny.
^eare garden when I do frequent
^r'th Globe on the bankeside,
^h'afford to me most rare content
As (...) full often have tried,
The best pastime that they can make
They instantly will undertake,
For my delight and pleasure sake,
But god a mercy penny.
In every place whereas I came
Both I and my sweet penny,
Got entertainment in the same
And got the love of many:
Both Tapsters, Cooks, and Vintners fine
With other toutall friends of mine,
Will pledge my health in beer or wine,
But god a mercy penny.
Good fellows company I used
As also honest women,
The painted drabs I still refused
And wenches that are common,
There luring looks I do despise
They seem so loathsome in mine eyes,
Yet one a protect did devise
To gull me of my penny.


One evening as I past a long
A less with borrowed ^aire,
Was singing of a tempting song,
Kind Sir quoth she, draw near,
But he that bites this rotten crab
May after chance to catch the scab.
No pander, baud, nor painted drab,
Shall gull me of a penny.
But curled hair and painted face
I ever have refrained,
All those that get their living base
In heart I have disdained,
My conscience is not staind with pitch,
No tempting tongue shall me bewitch,
I Will make no puncke nor pander rich,
I Will rather keep my penny.
Yet will I never niggard be
While I remain on earth,
But spend my money frolickely
In friendship love and mirth.
I Will drink my bear, I Will pay my score
And eke dispense some of my store,
And to the needy and the poor,
I Will freely give my penny.
Thus to conclude as I began
I wholly am inclined,
Wishing that each true hearted man
A faithful friend may find:
You that my verses stay to hear
Draw money for to buy me beer,
The price of it is not too dear
It Will cost you but a penny.
FINIS.
