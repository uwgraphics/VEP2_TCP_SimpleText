TO THE HONORABLE AND RENOWNED FOR virtue, learning, and true valor, Sir
KENELME DIGBYE Knight.
SIR,
THE excellent accomplishments wherewith you are adorned both of virtue, and
learning, and particularly in the Mathematical Sciences, together with the
Honorable respect the Author hereof bears unto your Worth, and his desire to
testify the same, has made me presume to present unto you, and under the
happy auspice of your renowned name, to publish to the world this Treatise: the
owning whereof though I may not challenge to my self, yet the birth and
production, whereby it has a being to the benefit of others, is, as unto a
second parent, due unto me.

For being in the time of the long vacation 1630, in the Country, at the house
of the Reverend, and my most worthy friend, and Teacher, Mr. William Oughtred
(to whose instruction I owe both my initiation, and whole progress in these
Sciences.) I upon occasion of speech told him of a Ruler of Numbers, Sines, and
I angents, which one had be spoken to be made (such as is usually called Mr.
Gunters Ruler) 6 feet long, to be used with a pair of beame-compasses. He
answered that was a poor invention, and the performance very troublesome: But,
said he, seeing you are taken with such mechanical ways of Instruments, I
will show you what devises I have had by me these many years. And first, he
brought to me two Rulers of that sort, to be used by applying one to the
other, without any compasses: and after that he showed me those lines cast
into a circle or Ring, with another moveable circle upon it. I seeing the great
expeditenesse of both those ways; but especially, of the latter, wherein it
far excels any other Instrument which has bin known; told him, I
wondered that he could so many years conceal such useful inventions, not
only from the world, but from my self, to whom in other parts and mysteries
of Art, be had bin so liber all. He answered, That the true way of Art is not
by Instruments, but by Demonstration: and that it is a preposterous course of
vulgar Teachers, to begin with Instruments, and not with the Sciences, and so
in-stead of Artists, to make their Scholars only doers of tricks, and as it
were Iuglers: to the despite of Art, loss of precious time, and betraying of
willing and industrious wits, unto ignorance, and idleness. That the use of
Instruments is indeed excellent, if a man be an Artist: but contemptible, being
set and opposed to Art. And lastly, that he meant to commend to me, the skill
of Instruments, but first he would have me well instructed in the Sciences. He
also showed me many notes, and Rules for the use of those circles, and of his
Horizontall Instrument, (which he had proiected about 30 years before) the
most part written in Latin. All which I obtained of him leave to translate
into English, and make public, for the use, and benefit of such as were
studious, and lovers of these excellent Sciences.

Which thing while I with mature, and diligent care (as my occasions would give
me leave) went about to do: another to whom the Author in a loving confidence
discovered this intent, using more have then good speed, went about to
preocupate; of which untimely birth, and preventing (if not circumuenting)
forwardness, I say no more: but advise the studious Reader, only so far to
trust, as he shall be sure does agree to truth and Art.

And thus most noble Sir, without any brauing flourishes, or needless
multiplying of tautologized and erroneous praecepts, in naked truth, and in the
modest simplicity, of the Author himself (whose known skill in the whole
Systeme of Mathematical learning, will easily free him from the suspicion of
having the way made for him, and the subject vnuailed, to help his sight) I
have notwithstanding under the protection of your courteous favor, and learned
judgment, persisted in my long conceived purpose, of presenting this tractate
to the public view, and light. Wishing withal unto you increase of deserved
honor, and happiness.

May the 1. 1632. By the honourer and admirer of your Worthiness, WILLIAM
FORSTER.

THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK, Showing the use of the First side of the
Instrument, for the working of Proportions both simple and compounded, and for
the ready and easy resolving of questions both in Arithmetique, Geometry, and
Astronomy, by Calculation.
CHAP. I. Of the Description, and use of the Circles in this First side.
1 THere are two sides of this Instrument. On the one side, as it were in the
plain of the Horizon, is delineated the proiection of the Sphare. On the other
side there are diverse kinds of Circles, divided after many several ways;
together with an Index to be opened after the manner of a pair of Compasses.
And of this side we will speak in the first place.

2 The First, or outermost circle is of Sines, from 5 degrees 45 minutes almost,
until 90. Every degree till 30 is divided into 12 parts, each part being 5
min: from thence until 50 degrees: into six parts which are 10 min: a piece: from
thence until 75 degrees into two parts which are 30 minutes a piece. After
that unto 85 degrees: they are not divided.

3 The Second circle is of Tangents, from 5 degrees 45 min: almost, until 45
degrees. Every degree being divided into 12 parts which are 5 min: a piece.

4 The Third circle is of Tangents, from 45 degrees until 84 degrees 15
minutes. Each degree being divided into 12 parts, which are 5 min: a piece.

5 The Sixth circle is of Tangents from 84 degrees till about 89 degrees 25
minutes.

The Seventh circle is of Tangents from about 35. min: till 6 degrees.

The Eight circle is of Sines, from about 35 minutes til 6 degrees.

6 The Fourth circle is of Unequal Numbers, which are noted with the Figures
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. Whether you understand them to be single Numbers,
or Tenns, or Hundreds, or Thousands, etc. And every space of the numbers till
5, is divided into 100 parts, but after 5 till 1, into 50 parts.

The Fourth circle also shows the true or natural Sines, and Tangents. For
if the Index be applied to any Sine or Tangent, it will cut the true Sine or
Tangent in the fourth circle. And we are to know that if the Sine or Tangent
be in the First, or Second circle, the figures of the Fourth circle do
signify so many thousands. But if the Sine or Tangent be in the Seventh or
Eight circle, the figures in the Fourth circle signify so many hundreds. And
if the Tangent be in the Sixth circle, the figures of the Fourth circle,
signify so many times ten thousand, or whole Radij.

And by this means the Sine of 23, 30 will be found 3987: and the Sine of
it is complement 9171. And the Tangent of 23, 30 will be found 4348: and the
Tangent of it is complement, 22998. And the Radius is 10000, that is the figure
1 with four ciphers, or circles. And hereby you may find out both the sum,
and also the difference of Sines, and Tangents.

7 The Fifth circle is of Aequall numbers, which are noted with the figures 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0; and every space is divided into 100 aequall parts.

This Fifth circle is scarce of any use, but only that by help thereof the
given distance of numbers may be multiplied, or divided, as need shall require.

As for example, if the space between 100 and 10833+ be to be septupled.
Apply the Index unto 10833+ in the Fourth circle, and it will cut in the Fifth
circle 03476+; which multiplied by 7 makes 24333: then again, apply the Index
unto this number 24333 in the Fifth circle, and it will cut in the Fouth circle
17512+. And this is the space between 100 and 10833+ septupled, or the Ratio
between 100, and 108 seven times multiplied into it self.

And contrarily, if 17512 be to be divided by 7: Apply the Index unto 17568
in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fit circle 24333: which divided by
7 gives 03476+. Then again unto this Number in the Fifth circle apply the
Index, and in the Fourth circle it will cut upon 10833+ for the Septupartion
sought for.

The reason of which Operation is, because this Fifth circle does show the
Logarithmes of Numbers. For if the Index be applied unto any number in the
Fourth circle, it will in the Fifth circle cut upon the Logarithme of the same
number, so that to the Logarithme found you praefixe a Caracteristicall (as
Master Brigs terms it) one less then is the number of the places of the
integers proposed (which you may rather call the Graduall Number). So the
Logarithme of the number 2 will be found 0.30103. And the Logarithme of the
Number 436 will be found 1.63949.

Numbers are multiplied by Addition of their Logarithmes: and they are Divided
by Substraction of their Logarithmes.

8 In the midst among the Circles, is a double Nocturnall instrument, to show
the hour of the night.

9 The right line passing through the Center, through 90, and 45 I call the
Line of Unity, or of the Radius.

10 That Arm of the Index which in every Operation is placed at the
Antecedent, or first terme', I call the Antecedent arm: and that which is
placed at the consequent term, I call the Consequent Arm.

CHAP. II. Of the Operation of the Rule of Proportion: and also of
Multiplication, and Division.
1. Theoreme. IF of three numbers given, the first divide the second and the
quotient multiply the third, the product shall be the fourth proportional, to
the three numbers given.

Theoreme. If of three numbers given, the second divide the first, and the
quotient divide the third; this later quotient shall be the fourth
proportional, to the three numbers given.

Neither is it material whether of the two numbers after the first be second,
or third.

2 And note that in Reciprocal proportion, that term by which the question is
made; But in Direct proportion the term that is homogeneal thereto, is the
first term, or the Antecedent of the first ratio.

3 And therefore out of these foundations thus laid, (if you rightly conceive
the nature of the Logarithmes) does follow the finding out of the fourth
proportional by this Instrument: whereof this is the Rule.

Open the Arms of the Instrument to the distance of the first, and second
number: then bring the Antecedent arm, or that which stood upon the first
number unto the third, and so the consequent arm, keeping the same opening,
will show the fourth number sought for.

In which operation these four things are diligently to be considered.

First, in constituting the places of each number in the fourth circle; whether
the figures written in the spaces do signify Unites, Tenns, or Hundreds, etc.

Secondly, if that arm which shows the fourth proportional, do reach
beyond the line of the Radius; that then you do account the fourth in a new
circle or degree.

Thirdly, whether the fourth number sought, ought to be greater, or lesser then
the third. For if a fourth number be offered greater then the third, when it
should be less, or less then the third when it should be greater; it is a
sign that that number does appertain to a circle of another degree.

Fourthly, that look what true distance was between the first and second,
that the same be supposed between the third and the fourth, and also on the
same part.

4 And for because Multiplication and Division, have a certain implicit
proportion: we will speak of them in the first place.

5 In Multiplication, As an Unite is to one of the factores (or numbers to be
multiplied:) so is the other of the factores, to the product.

And the product of two numbers shall have so many places as there be in both
the factores, if the lesser of them exceed so many of the first figures of the
product: But if it do not exceed, it will have one less.

6 And in Division, As the Divisor is to an Unite; so is the Dividend, to the
Quotient.

And the Quotient shall have so many places, as the Dividend has more then the
Divisor, if the Divisor exceed so many of the first figures of the Dividend:
but if it do not exceed, it shall have one place more.

7 Wherefore let this rule be still carefully kept in mind: that In
Multiplication the first term of the implicit proportion is evermore 1: And
in Division, the first term is the Divisor.

And thus much concerning the operation of Proportion, Multiplication, and
Division, I thought meet to admonish, least hereafter in Multiplying, or
Dividing, or seeking out a fourth proportional, we be constrained to repeat
the same things many times over.

8 An example of Multiplication. How many pence are there in 47li. 9sh? For
because 1 shilling contains 12 pence, and 1 pound contains 20 shillings, that
is 240 pence: you shall multiply 47 by 240, and 9 by 12, and then add together
the products.

In the first Multiplication. 1 ^ 47 240 ^ 11280 ^

For set the Arms of the Index at 1 and 47 in the fourth circle; and then
bring the Antecedent arm (which stood at 1) unto 240, and the Consequent arm
will show 11280.

Again in the second Multiplication. 1 ^ 9 12 ^ 108 ^

For set the two Arms of the Index at 1 and 9 in the fourth circle; and bring
the Antecedent arm unto 12, and the Consequent arm will show 108. Lastly,
add together 11280 and 108 and the sum 11388 will be the number of pence
contained in the said sum of 47li, 9sh.

9 An example of Division. How many pounds, and shillings are in 11388 pence?
Divide 11388 by 240: the division is thus. 240 ^ 1 11388 ^ 475 --

For set the two Arms of the Index at 240, and 1 in the fourth circle: and
then bring the Antecedent arm (which stood at 240) unto 11388; and the
Consequent arm will show 47 and almost an half.

But how many shillings that excess does contain will appear, if first you
find by Multiplication that 11280 pence are contained in 47li: which subducted
from 11388 there will remain for the excess 108 pence. Afterward by division
you may seek how many shillings are in 108 pence: the division is thus. 12 ^ 1
108 ^ 9.

For set the Arms of the Index at 12 and 1: then bring the Antecedent arm
(which stood at 12) unto 108; and the Consequent arm will show 9.

9 Any Fraction given may be reduced into Decimal parts, thus.

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at the Denominator of the Fraction given,
in the fourth circle, and the Consequent arm at the Numerator, then keeping
the same distance, bring the Antecedent arm unto 1, and the consequent arm
will show the decimal parts.

So ^40/^^^ is 075. And 19/48 is 0396 --

CHAP. III. Now follow certain examples of Proportion.
Example I. IF 54 Elnes of Holland be sold for 96 shillings, for how many
shillings was 9 elnes sold? The terms given are 54 ^ 96 9 ^

According to the 2 Chap. 3 Sect. Set one of the arms of the Index at the
Antecedent term 54 in the fourth circle, and the other arm at the consequent
term 96: then keeping that distance, bring the Antecedent arm unto 9; and the
consequent arm beyond the line of the Radius will show 16 for the fourth
proportional, according to the considerations in the 2 Chap. Sect. 3.

Therefore 54 ^ 96 9 ^ 16 ^ are proportionals. And 16 shillings is the price of
9 Elnes.

Example II. If 108 bushels of corn be sufficient for a company of Soldiers
keeping a Fort, for 36 days, How many days will 12 bushels suffice that same
number of Soldiers? The terms given are 108 ^ 36 12 ^

Set one Arm of the Index at the Antecedent term 108 in the fourth circle,
and the other Arm at the consequent term 12, (being mindful of the
considerations in the 2 Chap. 3 Sect.) then keeping that same distance, bring
the Antecedent arm unto 36; and the consequent arm will show 4.

Therefore 108 ^ 36 12 ^ 4 ^ shall be proportionals. And 4 is the number of
days sought for.

Example III. There is laid up in a Fort so much corn as will suffice for 756
Soldiers which keep that Fort, for 196 days: how many Soldiers will that
same corn suffice for 364 days?

The Proportion is reciprocal, therefore the terms given are 364 756 196 ^

Set one Arm of the Index at the Antecedent term 364, and the other Arm at
the consequent 196: and keeping the same distance, bring the Antecedent arm
unto 756; and the consequent arm will show 407+: And therefore for so many
Soldiers will the corn laid up suffice for 364 days, or 13 months.

Example IIII. There is a Tower whose height I would measure with a Quadrant.

I take two Stations in the same right line from the Tower: and at either
Station having observed the height through the sights, I find that the
perpendicular cutteth in the nearer Station 28 degrees 7 minutes almost: and in
the further Station 21 degr. 58 min. almost: and between both the Stations,
the distance was 76 feet.

The Rule of measuring heights by two Stations is contained in these Theoremes.

Theor. As the difference of the Tangents of the arches cut in either station,
is to the distance between the stations; so is the Tangent of the lesser arch,
to the nearer distance from the Tower. Again

Theor. As the Radius is to the Tangent of the greater arch; so is the nearer
distance found, to the height.

And therefore because by the 1 Chap. 6 Sect. the Tangents of the arches 28, 7
--, and 21 58 -- are 5342, and 4032 whose difference is 1310; the proportions
will be

First, 1310 ^ 76 tang. 21, 58 -- ^ 234 ^

Wherefore 234 feet is the nearer distance.

Second Radius ^ tang. 28, 7 -- 234 ^ 125 ^

Wherefore 125 feet is the height sought for.

Example V. To find the Declination of the Sun the 9th day of May.

The place of the Sun for every day, may be had nere enough out of this
Table, by Adding unto the place of the Sun in the beginning of that month so
many degrees, as there are days past in that month: But if the number of
degrees exceed 30, the excess is to be accounted in the Sign next following.

Wherefore the 9th of May the place of the Sun is 20+9, that is 29: which is 59
degr. distant from the next Aequinoctiall point.

The place of the Sun, in the beginning of every Month.
January 21 February 22 March 20 April 21 May 20 June 19 July 18 August 13
September. 18 October 17 November 18 December 19

These things being known, the Rule is delivered in this Theoreme.

Theor. As the Radius is to the sine of the suns distance from the next
Aequinoctiall point; so is the sine of the suns greatest declination, to the
sine of the declination sought for.

The proportion will be Radius ^ sine 59 sine 2^, 30 ^ sine 19 ^9^

And so much is the Declination sought for.

Example VI. To find the Right ascension of the Sun, the 9th day of May.

Seek the place of the Sun for the day proposed in the former Table; and the
Suns distance from the next Aequinoctial point, as in the former example.

These things being known, the Rule is by one of these two Theoremes.

Theor. As the Radius, is to the sine of the complement of the suns greatest
declination; so is the the tangent of the suns distance from the next
Aequinoctiall point, to the tangent of the distance of the right ascension of
the sun, from the same Aequinoctiall point. Or

Theor. As the tangent of the greatest declination of the Sun, is to the
Radius; so is the tangent of the declination of the sun for the time
proposed, unto the sine of the right ascension of the sun from the next
Aequinoctial point.

The proportions will be either Radius ^ sine 66, 30 tang. 59 ^ tang 56 46 ^

Or, tang. 23, 30 ^ Radius tang. 19, ^9 ^ sine ^6 4^*

Of Continual proportion, Or of Progression Geometrical.
1 THE Ratio of a Progression is the quotient of the consequent term divided
by his antecedent. And therefore in the Instrument it is the distance taken
between the terms in the fourth circle, by the opening of the Index.

2 To Double, Triple, or Multiply how often soever any Ratio given, is nothing
else but so often to put together the said space or distance between the
terms, as is showed in Chap 1. Sect. 7.

As for example, if the Ratio 60, to 65 be proposed to be septupled.

Set the Arms of the Index at 60, and 65: and then with the same opening,
bring the Antecedent arm which was at 60, unto 1, and the consequent arm will
cut 108384 in the fourth circle, and 03476 ^ in the fifth circle: this latter
number being multiplied by 7 makes 23444; unto which number in the fifth circle
applying the Index, it will in the fourth circle cut 1^^^2, which is the
multiplied number sought for.

But because in a little Instrument, the arch cut in the fifth circle, cannot be
estimated exactly: and a small error in the beginning often repeated, by
multiplying is made great: it is the most safe way, to take the Logarithmes of
the terms of the Ratio out of the Canon, and to multiply them by the number
given: As I have done in these examples.

Logarithmes taken out of the Canon.
100 2.0000000 104 2.0170333 105 2.0211893 106 2.0253059 106 2.0280287 107
2.0293838 107 2.0314085 -- 108 2.0334238 -- 108 2.0347621 108 2.0354297+ 108
2.0364293 -- 109 2.0374265 110 2.0313927

Or if the Canon be wanting; you may come nearer the mark, if that first
single opening of the Index being kept, and the Antecedent arm set at 1; you
transfer the Antecedent Arm, unto that place which the consequent arm does
cut; and the consequent arm will cut the same space duplicated. Then holding
the consequent arm in that same place, open the Antecedent arm unto 1. and
afterward with that duplicated opening, bring the Antecedent arm to the
duplicated space, and the consequent arm will cut the space quadrupled.
Thirdly, bring the Anticedent arm unto the quadrupled space and the consequent
arm, keeping that duplicated opening, will cut the space sextupled. Lastly,
having again taken a single opening, bring the Antecedent arm unto the
number, or space sextupled; and the consequent arm will show the Ratio sought
for septupled.

And this manner of working may be observed for as many Multiplications as you
please of any Ratio given.

3. The Ratio, and first term being given, to continue the same unto any
number of terms.

Open the Arms of the Index, the one unto the Antecedent of the ratio given,
and the other unto the consequent: then the same opening being kept, bring the
Antecedent Arm unto the first term given, and the consequent arm will show
the second term: again bring the Antecedent arm unto the second term found,
and the consequent arm will show the third. After that bring the Antecedent
arm unto the third term found, and the consequent arm will show the fourth.
And in this manner you may proceed as far as you please.

As for example, If a Progression in the ratio 2 unto 5, beginning at 8, Or if
a Progression in the ratio 100 unto 108, beginning at 5, is to be instituted;
the terms in either progression will be as follows.

1 2 ^ 5 8 ^ 20 2 20 3 50 4 125 5 3125 6 78125 7 1953125 1 100 ^ 108 5 ^ 54 2
54 3 5832 4 629856 5 68024448 6 7346640384 7 793437161472

4 Theor; The ratio of any former term, in a row of concinuall proportionals,
unto any of the terms following, is aequall to the ratio of the first term
unto the second, multiplied into it self according to the distance of that
latter term from the former.

As for example, The Ratio 54 unto 6^024448 which is the third term from it,
is aequall to the ratio of 100 unto 108 triplicated, Or as the Cube of 100 unto
the Cube of 108. Wherefore

5 The Ratio, and the first term of the Progression being given, to find out
any other term required.

First, multiply the ratio given into it self, according to the distance of
the term sought from the first term, by the 2 sect: then say

As 1 is to that mul^^ple found; so is the first term, to the term sought for.

Example, What will be the amount of 26th, in 7 years by Interest upon
Interest, after the rate of 20 pence in the pound?

Because 1 pound which is 20 shillings contains 60 groates, and 20 pence
contain 5 groates, the rate of the Interest will be 60 unto 65, Or 100 unto
108^^ x ^ But the first term is given 26, unto which there are to be acquired
7 other terms in continual proportion.

First, by the 4 Chap: and 2 Sect. Let the ratio given be septuplicated, that
is multiplied sevenfold into it self, which will be 1552. Then set the
consequent arm of the Index unto the septuplicate number 1552, and open the
Antecedent arm unto 1; and keeping the same opening, bring the Antecedent arm
unto 26; and the consequent arm will show 455312li the amount sought for.

6 The Ratio, and any other term of the Progression being given, to find the
first term.

First multiply the Ratio given into it self according to the difference of
the term given from the first term. Then say

As that multuple is unto 1; so is the term given, unto the first term.

Example, what sum in 7 years did amount unto 455312li by Interest upon
Interest after the rate of 100 unto 10833+?

First the ratio being septuplicat, by the 4 Chap. 2 Sect. will be 17512. Then
setting the Antecedent arm of the Index to that septuple 17512, open the
consequent arm unto 1: and keeping the same opening, bring the Arm unto
455312li: and the consequent arm will show 26, which was the stock, or sum
of money, from which that amount did arise.

7 The Ratio, the First term, and any other term of a Progression being
given, to find how many places the term given is from the first term.

First say, As the first term is unto 1; so is the other term given, unto the
ratio multiplied into it self according to the distance of that term from the
first.

Wherefore according to 1 Chap. 7 Sect. and 3 Chap. 2 Sect. by help of the
fifth circle, see how often the ratio given, is contained in that multuple found.

Example, In how many years did 26li, by Interest upon Interest after the rate
of 100 unto 10833+ + increase unto 455312li?

First set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 26, and the consequent arm at
1: and keeping the same opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 455312, and the
consequent arm will show 17^12: to which in the fifth circle answers 24333.
Then because unto the consequent term of the ratio 10833+ + there agrees in
the fifth circle 03476, divide 24333 by 03476, and the quotient will be 7, the
number of years sought for.

8 The First term, and any other term of the Progression being given to find
the ratio of the Progression.

First say, As the first term is unto 1: so is the other term given, unto the
ratio multiplied into it self according to the distance of that term from the
first.

Wherefore according to Chap. 1. Sect. 7, by help of the fifth circle, Let the
multuple found be divided by the distance of the term from the first.

Example, 26li by Interest upon Interest in 7 years amounted unto 455312: what
was the ratio of the Interest compared unto 100?

First set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 26, and the consequent arm at
1: and then keeping the same opening, bring the Antecedent arm unto 455312:
and the consequent arm will show 17^12: unto which in the fifth circle
answers 24333 and this number being divided by 7 will give 03476+: unto which
agrees in the fourth circle 10833+ + the consequent term of the Interest
sought for.

9 Two numbers being given to find as many Middle proportionals between them
as you will.

Divide the distance of the greater number given from the lesser in the fourth
circle justly taken, according to Chap. 1. Sect. 7, by help of the fifth circle
into equal segments, one more then are the number of Middle proportionals
sought for. All these segments added orderly to the first term, do
distinguish the terms of the Progression which you seek.

Example, Let there be four Middle proportionals, sought out between 8 and
1990656.

Apply the Index unto 8 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the first
circle 9039: also set the Index unto 1991 -- in the fourth circle, and it will
cut in the fifth circle 2989; which number because it reaches beyond the Unite
^^ne, is indeed 12989, according to Chap. 1. Sect. 7, and so is the distance
justly taken. Then subducting 9039 from 12989, there will remain 3950: which
divided by 4 + 1, the quotient will give 790. wherefore 9039 + 790, scil. 9829
in the fifth circle does agree with 96 in the fourth circle, which is the first
middle proportional. And 9039 + twice 790, scil. 10619 in the fifth circle does
agree with 1152 in the fourth circle, which is the second middle proportional.
And in this manner 13824, and 165888 will be found the third and fourth middle
proportionals.

10 Theor. If from the Ratio given, being multiplied in it self according to
the number of terms, you subduct 1, and multiply the remainder, by the
antecedent of the ratio. It will be

As the difference of the terms of the ratio, is unto the product; so is the
first term, to the sum of the Progression.

As for example if the Ratio of the Progression be R to S: and the difference
of R taken out of S be D. and the first term of the Progression a: and the
whole sum of the terms Z it shall be, D ^ rat. multa -- 1 in R a ^ Z.

Which is the very Theoreme it self expressed in Symboles of words: that it
may more easily be fixed in the fantasy. Which proportion also we must
consider, does hold both alternly, and conuersly.

This Theoreme may otherwise be expressed, by the equality which the product
of the two middle terms has to the product of the two extremes, thus Ratio
multiplicata -- 1 in R in a = Z in D.

This manner of setting down Theoremes, whether they be Proportions, or
Equations, by Symboles or notes of words, is most excellent, artificial, and
doctrinall. Wherefore I earnestly exhort every one, that desires though but to
look into these noble Sciences Mathematical, to accustom themselves unto it:
and indeed it is easy, being most agreeable to reason, yea even to sense. And
out of this working may many singular consectaries be drawn: which without
this would, it may be, for ever lie hid. As in this present proportion: because
it is D ^ rat. multa -- 1 in ^ a ^ Z ^ wherefore Rat. multa -- 1 in R ^ D Z ^ a
^ And a ^ Z D ^ rat. multa -- 1 in R

These are exceeding easy: but this following is more difficult, and requires
attention.

In the former equation it was Rat. multa -- 1 in R in a = Z in D

Now because Rat. multa -- 1 in R in a, and Rat. multa ^^ in R in a -- R in a,
and Rat. multa in R -- R in a, and Rat. multa in a -- a in R, are equal one to
another, and also to Z in D, these aequations shall also be consectarious. ^
and ^ and ^ and ^

And besides these many more. The practice whereof I leave to the industry of
the studious Reader, especially having delivered the whole Art of such
operations in my Clavis Mathematica.

Some of these I have occasion to use in the sections following.

11. Therefore the Ratio of a Progression, and the first term, and the number
of terms being given, to find the sum of the whole progression.

For this operation the rule, or Theoreme last before serves: for by it ^

Example. If an Annuity of 5li, be detained 7 years, what will be the amount
thereof by interest upon interest after the rate of 100 unto 108?

Now because the Amount is the sum of the Progression, whereof the first
term is the annuitie, Multiply the ratio into it self according to the number
of years, by Chap. 4. Sect. 2, and it will be 171382: from which if you
subduct an unite, there remains 071382, which multiplied by 100 makes 71382:
then set the Arms of the Index at 1 and 71382; and bring the Antecedent arm
which stood at 1, unto 5 the first term: and the consequent arm will cut
356915 (that is Rat. multa -- 1 in R in a) and lastly this number being divided
by 108 -- 100, scil. by 8, the quotient will give 446^40, for the sum of the
whole progression: and so much is the amount sought for.

12. The Ratio, the Number of Terms, and the Sum of a Progression being
given, to find the first term.

By the converse of the foregoing Theoreme, it is manifest, that Rat multa -- 1
in R ^ D Z ^ a ^

The declaration in words was in the 10 Sect.

Example. If an Annuitie detained 7 years by Interest upon Interest, after the
rate of 100 unto 108, did increase unto 446140li. how much was that Annuitie?

Multiply the Ratio into it self according to the number of years (per cap.
4. sect. 2.) and the product will be 17^^82: from which if you subduct an
Unite, there remains 07^^82: this being multipled by 100 does make 71^82. Then
say 71382 ^ 8 446140 ^ 5 ^ for the First term: which was the Annuitie sought
for.

13 The Ratio, the First term, and the Sum of the Progression being given,
to find the Number of terms.

By the Theoreme in the 10. Sect. it was a ^ Z D ^ rat. multa -- 1 in R ^

Wherefore set the Antecedent arm of the Index unto the Antecedent term of
the ratio, and the consequent arm unto the Sum of the Progression: and with
that same opening, bring the Antecedent arm unto the difference of the terms
of the ratio; and the consequent arm will show a number (that is Rat. mul. -- 1
in R;) which if you divide by the Antecedent term of the ratio, and unto the
quotient add an Unite, you shall have the ratio multiplied into it self
according to the number of terms. Therefore taking the distance between the
terms of the ratio, with the arms of the Index, measure by help of the fifth
circle (per Cap. 4. Sect. 7.) how often that distance may be found in the
multiplied ratio: for so many are the terms of the progression.

Example. If an Annuitie of 5li detained by Interest upon interest after the
rate of 100 to 108, increased unto 446140li. How many years was the Annuitie
detained?

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 5, and the consequent arm at 446140,
and with the same opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 8, and the consequent
arm will show 71382 (that is Rat. multa -- 1 in R:) this number being divided
by 100, will be 071382: and if unto the quotient you add 1, you shall have
171^82 (the ratio multiplied into it self according to the number of years:)
unto which in the fifth circle answers 2338: but unto 108 in the fifth circle
there answers 0334. divide therefore 2338 by 0334; and the quotient will be
7, for the number of years sought for.

Or such questions may be more easily performed by this Theoreme, which the
industrious Reader may by himself practice. ^

14 Theor. If the sum of the whole progression be divided by the ratio
multiplied into it self according to the number of terms, the quotient will
be the first term; and that sum given will be the last term, of another
progression, having the same ratio but one term more.

15 And because a sum of money the amount whereof in any number of years
given, by Interest upon interest, does equal an Annuitie so long detained, is
equivalent to the same Annuitie; and the amount of an Annuitie is the sum of
a Progression continued from that Annuitie. If therefore an Annuitie for any
number of years be divided by the ratio multiplied into it self according to
the number of years; the quotient will be the just price of an Annuitie to
endure for so long. And because by the 10 and 11 Sect. it has been showed
that ^.

Therefore by the 14 Sect. ^ will be equal to the price of an Annuitie in
ready money, which shall be the Rule for the operation following.

Wherefore also Rat. multa -- 1 in R in a = Rat. multa in D in Pret. which
proportion is thus enuntiated in words.

Theor. If from the Ratio multiplied into it self according to the Number of
years you subduct an Unite, and the remainder be multiplied continually by the
Antecedent of the Ratio, and the Annuitie it self: And again, If the Ratio
multiplied into it self, according to the number of years be multiplied
continually by the difference of the terms of the Ratio, and by the Price:
both those products will be equal.

Example. An Annuitie of 5li, to endure for 7 years, is to be sold: what is it
worth in ready money, after the Rate of 100 unto 108?

The Ratio multiplied into it self according to the number of years (per Cap.
4 Sect. 2) is 17138: subduct 1, and there will remain 071382: which multiplied
by 100 makes 71382. Then set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the
consequent arm 71382: and keeping that same opening, bring the Antecedent arm
unto 5; and the consequent arm will show 356915; keep this (for it is ^.
After that set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm
unto the multuple ratio 17138; and with the same opening bring the Antecedent
arm unto 8; and the consequent arm will cut 137106, keep this number also
(for it is Rat. mul. in a). Lastly, place the Antecedent arm of the Index at
137106, and the consequent arm at 1; and with the same opening bring the
Antecedent arm unto 356015: and the consequent arm will show 26032li. which
is the just Price of an Annuitie of 5li in ready money.

16 And by the last praecedent Theoreme or Rule, also ^ which Theoreme may be
enuntiated in words as was there showed.

Example. An Annuitie for 7 years is bought for 26032li. after the rate of 100
unto 108, by Interest upon interest: how much was that Annuitie?

The Ratio multiplied into it self for the number of 7 years (per Cap: 4,
Sect. 2) is 17138: which multiplied continually by 8, and by the price, does
make 356915. Divide this number found, by 71382, (which is the multuple ratio)
it self less by an Unite, and multiplied by 100: and the quotient will be
5li, the Annuitie sought for.

17. Also by Ratiocination from that praecedent rule will follow this
proposition ^ which is thus enuntiated in words.

Theor. If the product of the Antecedent of the ratio multiplied by the
Annuitie be divided by it self, being diminished by the product of the
difference of the terms of the ratio multiplied by the Price: the quotient
will be equal to the ratio multiplied into if self according to the number
of years. As

If the ratio be 100 unto 108; the Annuitie 5li: and the price thereof 26032li.
Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm at 8, the
difference of the terms of the ratio: and with the same opening bring the
Antecedent arm unto 26032 --: and the consequent arm will show 208256: which
subducted from 500, there will remain 291744, for the divisor. Set therefore
the Antecedent arm of the Index at the divisor 291744, and the consequent arm
at 1: and with the same opening, bring the Antecedent arm unto the dividend
500: and the consequent arm will show 171^8, which is the ratio multiplied
into it self according to the number of years. And by this number so found it
will be easy (by help of the fifth circle) the ratio of the Interest being
given, to find the continuance of the Annuitie.

Example. An Annuitie of 5il, was bought for 26032li --, after the rate of 100
unto 108: how many years is it to last?

First seek out the ratio multiplied into it self according to the number of
years, which will be 171^8, according as was even now showed in this Sect. to
this in the fifth circle there answers 2338: but unto 108 there answers in
the fifth circle 0334. Divide therefore 2338 by 0334; and the quotient will be 7
for the number of years sought for.

CHAP. V. Of the Quadrating, and Cubing of Numbers, Sides or Roots: and of the
Extraction of the Quadrate, and Cubic side, or root, out of Numbers, or Powers
given.
1 IF a number, side, or root be multiplied into it self; the product will be
a Quadrat. And if a quadrate be multiplied into his own side, or root, the
product will be a Cube. Wherefore 1 ^ N N ^ Q ^ and 1 ^ N Q ^ C ^

2 If therefore a number be given to be Quadrated. Set the Antecedent arm of
the Index at 1, and the consequent arm at the number given: then with the some
opening bring the Antecedent arm to the number given; and the consequent arm
will show the Quadrat thereof.

And the number of figures in a Quadrat of a single root (or which does not
exceed 9) is easily found out by those Rules, that have been before delivered
concerning Multiplication. But if a side or root consist of more figures then
one; for each figure after the first it acquireth two more places of figures.
And if any of the figures of the root given be decimal parts, cut off from the
Quadrat found, twice so many of the last figures for decimals.

Example 1. The Quadrat of the side 7 is required. Say 1 ^ 7 7 ^ 49 Set
therefore the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm at 7;
and with that opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 7; and the consequent arm
will show 49 which is the Quadrat sought for.

Example 11. The Quadrat of the side 57 is required.

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1; and the consequent arm at 57: then
with that same opening bring the antecedent arm unto 57; and the consequent
arm will show 3249, which is the Quadrat sought for, consisting of four
places.

Example 111. The Quadrat of the side, or root 570 is required.

Having found as before, 3249 for the quadrat of the side 57: put thereunto two
circles: and it will be 324900, the quadrat sought for.

Example 1111. The quadrat of the side 574 is required.

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the corsequent arm at 574; and
with the same opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 574; and the consequent
arm will show 329476, the quadrat sought for consisting of six figures: but
the two last figures cannot at all be discerned by the Instrument.

3 If a number be given to be Cubed.

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm at the
number given; and with that same opening, bring the Antecedent arm unto the
number given; and the consequent arm will show the Quadrat; then bring the
Antecedent arm unto the Quadrat, and the consequent arm with that same
opening will show the Cube of that side given.

The number figures in a Cube of a single side, or root which does not exceed
9, is easily found by that which has been before delivered concerning
Multiplication: But if the side, or root consist of more figures then one; for
each figure after the first it obtains three more places of figures. And if
any of the figures of the root given be decimal parts, cut off from the Cube
found thrice so many of the last figures for decimal parts.

Example. The Cube of the side, or root 7 is required. Say, 1 ^ 7 7 ^ 49 ^
again 1 ^ 7 49 ^ 343 ^

Set therefore the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm
at 7; and with that opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 7, and the
consequent arm will show 49 the quadrat thereof: Then set the Antecedent arm
at 49; and the consequent arm (with that first opening) will show 343, which
is the desired Cube of the side proposed.

Another example, The Cube of the side, or root 57 is required.

Set the Antecedent arm of the Index at 1, and the consequent arm at 57; and
with that same opening bring the Antecedent arm unto 57; and the consequent
arm will show the quadrat 3249. Then set the Antecedent arm at 3249; and the
consequent arm keeping the former opening will show 185193, which is the
required Cube of that side proposed, consisting of six places: but the two last
figures cannot be known by the Instrument.

Example III. The Cube of the side 570 is required.

Having found as before the Cube of the side, or root 57 to be 185193: put
thereunto three circles; and it will be 185 193000 the Cube sought for.

Examples of greater Cubes, it will be needless to set down.

4 The Extraction of the Square, or Quadrat root, or side, is done by help of
the fifth circle, after this manner.

Set the Index at the Quadrat proposed; and of that number which it cuts in the
fifth circle, take half: then set the Index at that half; and it will show in
the fourth circle, the side, or root sought for.

But you must know that if the number which is the Quadrat proposed, have only
two places of Integers, the side, or root consists of one figure. But if it
have more places of Integers, dividing them by 2, the quotient will give the
true number of figures in the root, if it measure it exactly; or one less then
the true number if any thing remain.

Example I. The side, or root of the Quadrat 49 is required.

Set the Index at 49 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fifth circle
6902; indeed 1. 6902 having the graduall number 1 praefixed, because 1 in the
fourth circle signifies 10, one circuition thereof being finished: the half
whereof is 0. 8451. Then set the Index at 0. 8451, in the fifth circle; and it
will cut in the fourth circle 7, the side, or root sought for.

Example II. The side, or root of the quadrat 3249 is required.

Set the Index at 3249 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fifth circle
5118; indeed 3. 5118 prefixing the gradual number 3, because 1 in the fourth
circle signifies 1000, three circuitions thereof being finished: the half
whereof is 1. 7559. Then set the Index at 7559, omitting the prefixed graduall
number 1; and it will show in the fourth circle 57 the side sought for,
consisting of two figures, because 1 in the fourth circle signifies 10.

Example III. The side of the quadrat 329476 is required.

Set the Index at 329476 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fifth
circle 5178; indeed 5. 5178 prefixing the graduall number 5, because 1 in the
fourth circle signifies 100000, five circuitions thereof being past over; the
half whereof is 2. 7589; Then set the Index at 7589, omitting the graduall
number 2 prefixed thereto; and it will show in the fourth circle 574 the side,
or root sought for, consisting of three figures, because 1 in the fourth circle
does signify 100.

5 The Extraction of the Cubic root, or side is done by help of the fifth
circle after this manner.

Set the Index at the Cube proposed; and that number which it cuts in the fifth
circle divide by 3. Then set the Index at that third part, and it will show in
the fourth circle the side, or root sought for.

And you must know that if the Cube proposed have only three places of
Integers, the side, or root thereof consists of one figure: But if it have
more places of Integers; divide them by 3, the quotient will give the true
number of the figures of the Root, if it measure it exactly; or one less then
the true number if any thing remain.

Example I. The side, or root of the Cube 343 is required.

Set the Index at 343 in the fourth circle, and it will cut in the fifth circle
5353; indeed 2. 5353 prefixing the graduall number 2, because 1 in the fourth
does signify 100, two circuitions thereof being past over: the third part
whereof is 8451. Then set the Index at 8451, and it will show in the fourth
circle 7, the side sought for.

Example II. The side, or root of the Cube 185193 is required.

Set the Index at 185193 in the fourth circle; and it will cut in the fifth
circle 2677; indeed 5. 2677 prefixing the graduall number 5, because 1 in the
fourth circle does signify 100000, five circuitions thereof being past over:
the third part whereof is 1. 7599. Then set the Index at 7599, omitting the
prefixed graduall number 1; and in the fourth circle it will show 57, the side,
or root sought for, consisting of two figures, because 1 in the fourth circle
does signify 10.

Examples of greater Cubes it will be needless to set down.

CHAP. VI. Of Duplicated, and Triplicated proportion. And first of Duplicated
proportion.
Theoreme. LIke Plains are in a Duplicated ratio, that is, As the Quadrats of
their homologal sides. And therefore questions in the which the sides of like
planes are compared, do appertain unto this place.

And it is to be noted, that if three numbers be given, in which As the quadrat
of the first, is unto the quadrat of the second; so ought the third to be unto
a number sought for. Let it be thus done, As the first number, is to the
second; so is the third to afourth; And again As the first number, is to the
second; so is the fourth now found, to the number sought for.

Example I. There are two like rectangle Areae, or plains, the length of the
greater, is 40 feet, the length of the lesser 24 feet: each of them paved with
paving tiles; the greater has 1200 tiles: how many shall the lesser have?

The Areae, or plains are one to the other, as the quadrats of the longitudes
given. And the proportion is direct. Say therefore 1600 (Q 40) ^ 576 (Q 24)
1200 ^ 432 ^ which is the number of tiles contained in the pavement of the
lesser Areae, or plain.

Example II. How many Acres of woodland measured with a Perch, of 18 feet, are
there in 73 Acres of champane land, measured with a Perch of 16 feet?

The measures given (18, 16) being reduced into their lest terms, are as 12
unto 11: and the quadrats of these numbers, are, 144, and 121. And the
Proportion is Reciprocal. Say therefore 144 (Q 12) ^ 121 (Q 11) 73 ^ and so
many are the Acres of Wood land.

Of Triplicated proportion.
3 Theor. Like Solids are in a Triplicated ratio, that is, As the Cubes of
their homologal sides. And therefore questions in which the sides of like
solids are compared, do appertain unto this place.

4 If three numbers be given in the which, As the Cube of the first is to the
Cube of the second; so is the third number to a number sought for. Let it be
thus done, As the first number is to the second; so is the third to a fourth:
Again, As the first is to the second; so is the fourth now found unto a fifth.
And thirdly, As the first is to the second; so is that fifth to the number
sought for.

Example. If 4^/100lib. of gunpowder, suffice to charge a Gun, whereof the
concave diameter is inch 1. How many pounds of powder will suffice to charge a
Gunne, whose concave diameter is 7 inches?

The capacities are one to another, as the Cubes of the diameters. And the
proportion is direct. Say therefore 3375 (C 15) ^ 343 (C 7) 043 ^ 4^^ +
wherefore 43^lib. of Gunpowder, will be needful to be had.

Another example, 437lib. of Gunpowder are sufficient to charge a Gun, whose
diameter in the concave is 7 inches: now there is another sort of Gunpowder,
much more strong and forcible, that is in strength unto the former, as 5 unto
2: How much of this stronger powder, will suffice to charge a Gun of 4 inches
diameter?

Here are two operations: the first seeks out, how much of that stronger
powder suffices to charge a Gun of 7 inches diameter: and the proportion is
reciprocal, that is 5 ^ 2 437 ^ 1548

The second operation is like that in the former example. 343 (C 7) 64 (C 4)
1548 ^ 3^^^^

CHAP. VII. Concerning the Measuring of Circles, Cones, Cylinders, and Sphaeres.
1 ARchimedes in a peculiar Treatise found the proportion of the Diameter of a
circle to the Circumference to be a very small deal greater then o^ 7 unto
22: And of late Ludolph Van Ceulen insisting in the same steps of Archimedes,
has more precisely found it to be of 1 unto 3141592653589793 but for our
Instrument it will be sufficient to take the ratio of 1 unto 31416, Or of
03183+ unto 1: leaving the diligent practizer, to more exactness, if he please
to use his Pen.

And note that the Rules following are set down in proportions, to be wrought
as has been taught in Chap. 2, Sect. 3. Wherein

D, or Diam. signifies the Diameter. Dq, or Q. Diam. the Quadrat of the
Diameter. Dc, or C. Diam. the Cube of the Diameter. R, or Rad. the Radius, or
Semidiameter. P, or Perif. the Periferie, or Circumference. Pq, the Quadrat of
the Periferie. Long. the length. L the side, or latus Alt. the altitude. ^,
shows that the two magnitudes between which it is set, are to be multiplied
together.

unto a fourth. Then again say, As 7x3 is to 22, Or as 1 is to 10472: so is the

the diamerer of their base, the same with the Axis of the Sphaere. Or which is

diameter of the base the same with the Axis of the Sphaere.

CHAP. VIII. Concerning Plain, and Solid Measures.
1 THe dividing of the Carpenters ruler into Inches, and half, and quarters,
and half quarters of Inches, that is of every Inch into eight parts, is most
inartificiall, and unfit for measuring, by reason of the manifold
denominations, which must be brought into one, and is hard to be done of them
that are unskillful. I would wish therefore that every Inch were divided into
10 parts, or rather that the foot were divided into 100 parts, which is best of
all: for then there will need no reduction. And all other divisions must be
reduced unto this, by these Rules following.

2. If the measures be taken upon a Ruler divided into Inches and tenth parts
of an Inch, first take out all the whole feet, and then divide the Inches
remaining, with their decimall parts if there be any by 12.

Example. How many feet and decimall parts of a foot, are in Inches 173?

First take out the whole foot which is 12 Inches, and there will remain
Inches 53: which being divided by 12, you shall have 442 thousand parts almost:
wherefore Inches 173, is feet 1442 --. And contrariwise, feet 1442 --, shall be
reduced into Inches 17^, being multiplied by 12.

3. If the measure be taken upon a Ruler divided into inches and half
quarters, that is each inch into 8 parts, First you must reduce the eight parts
into decimals of Inches, by dividing the number of parts given by 8 the
Denominator thereof: and afterward by the former Rule, reduce the Inches, and
decimall parts, into decimall parts of a foot.

Example. How many feet, and decimall parts of a foot, are in 7 inches, and 5
eight parts?

First divide the 5 eight parts by 8, and you shall have 625 thousand parts:
which being put to 7 inches, will make inches 7625: Again divide these by 12,
as was showed in the former rule: and the whole measure will be feet 0635. And
contrariwise feet 0635, will be reduced into inches 7625, being multiplied by
12.

4. I must advise all those that have occasion, to measure Plains, or Solids,
to make themselves very perfect in this kind of Reduction (because most Rulers
they shall ordinarily meet withal, are divided into inches, and half
quarters) which will be very easy to them, if they do but remember, that In
division the first term of the proportion employed, is the Divisor it self:
but in Multiplication, the first term is evermore 1. as has been showed in
Chap: 2, Sect: 7. And therefore, presuming on the diligence of the Practiser
herein, I shall not need in this kind of measuring, to speak any more of
inches, but of feet and decimall parts of feet, as if the Ruler were so divided.

Of Plain measures.
5. A Parallelogram, or four sided rectangle Superficies, being proposed, to
find the length of a Superficial foot.

Take with your Ruler the breadth thereof in feet, and decimals of a foot: and
by the breadth so taken divide 1. the quotient shall be the length of a
superficial foot.

Example. A board is feet 117 broad, how much thereof will make a foot?

Divide 1 by 117, the quotient will be 0855 almost: so much shall the length
of a foot be, which multiplying the parts by 12, will give inches 1026. And
again those parts multiplied by 8, will give 2 eight parts of an inch.

Example, II. In tileing, or healing they use to reckon by the Square, which is
10 foot every way, in all 100 ^eet. There is roof, feet 162^ broad, how much
thereof makes a Square?

Divide 100 by 1625 the quotient will be 6^^4 almost: so much shall be the
length of one square; which multiplying the parts by 12, will be 6 feet, and
inches 18^^ -- almost. And again those parts multiplied by 8, will give
somewhat more then 6 eight parts of an inch.

Example, III: In pauing they use to reckon by the yard, which is 3 feet every
way, in all 9 feet. There is a room to be paued, which is feet 1735 broad;
how much thereof makes a yard?

Divide 9 by 1735, the quotient will be 0519 almost, the length of one yard.

6: A four sided rectangle Superficies, with all the opposite sides parallel
being proposed, to find the content.

Take with your Ruler both the breadth and length of and multiply the one
number into the other.

Example, A board is feet 117 broad, and feet 1632 long: how many feet does it
contain in all?

Multiply 163^ by 117 the product will be feet 19^ almost: the whole quantity
of that board.

Example. II. A certain barn tiled, has the breadth of the roof feet, 162^,
and the length of the barn is feet 47, how many squares of tiling has it?

Double the length (that you may have both sides of the roof) and it will be
94, which being multiplied by 1625, will give feet 1527^. Again divide those
feet by 100, so shall you have squares 15275.

Example. III. A certain hall paued has the breadth feet 1735, and the length
feet 305, how many yards does it contain?

Multiply 1735 by 305, the product will be feet 229175. Divide these by 9 and
the quotient will be yards 58797.

7. A four sided Superficies with the two sides of length only parallel being
proposed, to find the content thereof.

Take with your Ruler the length of the two parallel sides thereof: add both
those numbers together, multiply half that sum, by the breadth of the
Superficies taken the nearest way over, and the product will be the content
thereof.

Example. A Trapezium, or four sided figure is proposed, having two sides
thereof parallel, the length of the longer parallel side is feet 1875 and the
length of the shorter side is feet 144^, the breadth thereof being taken the
nearest way over is feet 125, I would know how many feet are contained in the
whole Superficies?

The length of the parallel sides are feet 18^5, and 1445, which added
together make 33^, half whereof is 16^, which multiplied by the breadth 12^,
the product will be 2075, so many feet are contained in the superficies of the
Trapezium proposed.

8. A four sided Superficies which has none of the sides parallel, as also
every plain figure of more sides the four being proposed, must with
Diagoniall lines be divided into triangles. And note that every such figure
contains so many triangles as it has sides, abating two out of the number.
Then those triangles are to be measured severally as follows.

9 To find the content, or Area of a Triangle.

Take the perpendicular height, or nearest distance between the base or known
side, and the angle opposite: and by that height multiply half the base, or
multiply the whole base by half that perpendicular height: and the product
shall be the content, of that Triangle.

But if it be an Aequilater triangle: say, 1000 ^ 4330127 the side of the
triangle ^ Area ^

10. To find the content of a segment of a Circle, whereof the Periferia is
given in degrees and decimall parts.

First say, As 100000, is to 174532025: so is the Arch in degrees, to the Arch
in the divisions of the Radius. keep this number found.

Again by the 6 Sect: 1 chap: find out the true sinus of the Arch given. Then
take the difference of these two numbers found, by subducting the Sinus out of
the Arch. And lastly multiply half that difference by the Radius 100000, the
product shall be the content of that segment.

11 The chord of any arch, together with the Radius, or semidiameter of the
whole circle being given, to find out the Arch it self. Say,

At the Radius given, is to half the chord (reckoned in the fourth circle) so
is 100000, to the sinus of half the arch (to be reckoned in the first, or
eighth circle). Wherefore double the arch found, and so have you the arch of the
chord proposed.

12 To find a Quadrat, or Square equal to a superficies given.

First, seek out (as has been taught) the content of that superficies: then
take the quadrat root thereof by Chap. 5, Sect. 4.

Of Solid measures.
13 In a Column, or Cylinder, having the base, to find how much of it makes
a foot solid.

By a Column I mean a solid body arising from a plain base, the angular
lines whereof are parallel, and equal: and if the angular lines make right
angles with the base, it is a right Column, and the length is the height
thereof: but if they make oblique angles, it is an Oblique Column, and the
length is not the height, but the height is a perpendicular line let down from
the top of the Column unto the base, extended if need be: as in the
Diagrame, the Solid ABCDEFGH, is an Oblique Column, because the angular line
EB, stands obliquely upon the side of the base BA, and indeed upon the base
it self. Wherefore the height of it shall be equal to the line FP, let fall
from the top unto the base extended.

diagram

And after this manner also a Cylinder, and a Pyramid, and a Cone is esteemed
either right, or oblique, and the height taken accordingly.

First therefore the base is to be found, of what fashion soever it is, as has
even now been showed, either in this Chapter, or in the last before: and then
divide 1 by that same base: the quotient shall be, the height of a Section
thereof, which is equal to one foot solid.

Example. A Column, or piece of timber, whose sides are all parallel, has the
breadth feet 175, and the thickness thereof is feet 125: which multiplied
together the product will be 21875. Divide therefore 1, by 21875: and the
quotient shall be 0457143 almost. And so much is the height of a solid foot, of
that piece of timber.

14 Having the Base, and the height of a Column, or Cylinder, to find the
whole content.

Multiply the base into the height, and the product shall be the content.

Example. A Column has the base feet 21875, and the height thereof is feet
1734, how many feet are contained in the whole?

Multiply the base 21875, by 1734 and the product will be 36086875, so many
solid feet are contained in that Column.

And in this very manner may you find the content of a Cylinder, having either
the diameter, or circumference given, together with the height.

15 To measure tapering timber, the base, or bases thereof, together with the
height being given.

A Tapering piece of timber, according as the base thereof is right lined, or
circular, is either a Pyramide or a Cone, or else a segment of one of these
two: If it be a complete Pyramide, or Cone, it has but one base, Multiply that
base by of the height, and the product shall be the content.

But if it be the segment of a Pyramide, or Cone, First find out the bases at
both the ends, and multiply the one by the other, and out of the product
thereof extract the Quadrat root: then add together both the bases, and that
quadrat root, and multiply the Aggregate thereof by of the height, the product
shall be the content.

Example. There is a tapering piece of timber, the height whereof is feet 126,
and the breadth of the base at the greater end is feet 175, and the thicknes is
feet 132, which multiplied together, the product will be feet 23^ for the
greater base: the breadth of the base at the lesser end is feet 12, and the
thickness there, is feet 091, which multiplied together, the product will be
feet 1052 for the lesser base. Multiply the bases together, the product will be
252252, the quadrat root whereof is 1588 almost, to which if you add the
sums of both the bases, the aggregate will be 499, which being multiplied by
of the height, scil. 42, the product will be feet 20958, the content of the
piece of timber.

16 Wherefore that vulgar manner which Carpenters use in measuring of tapering
timber, is not true: for if a piece of timber be tapering, they measure it in
the very middle, and take the base, or Section there, multiplying it by the
whole length. Which their manner of working, Isay, is erroneous.

For first by practice a content will be given, ever less then the true
content found according to the former Sect: which way of working is infallibly
true, as is Analitically demonstrated, in my Clauis mathematica, Cha. 20, Sect:
15.

And secondly Isay, that the product of that middle base, or Section,
multiplied by the length, shall be less then the true content, by four
Pyramides, having for their bases, a rectangle under half the difference of
the thickness at the ends, and a quarter of the difference of the breadths:
and are as long as half the piece of timber: Or which is all one, by a
Parallelepipedon, under half the differences of the breadthes, and
thicknesses, at both ends, and a third part of the whole length.

diagram

Which that I may show, suppose one quarter of a tapering piece of timber
given, sawed in ^unner, at half the breadth, and half the thickness be
ABCDGFEH: the middle Section is IK^M. Measure upon the greater base BN, and CO,
equal to AF, and BY, and NZ, equal to FE. Divide CT, and DO to the midst, in
the points X, and Q, and draw the lines PQ, NO parallel to BC, and YZ, SX
parallel to BG. Measure also FER, equal to GS, or KL. And so the Parallelegram
BPTX, shall be equal to the middle Section IKLM. Lastly, draw the lines LO,
LV, LZ, and KP, KN, and MX, MY.

I say that in this one quarter of the piece of timber, A solid having the
bases equal to IKLM, and the length AB (which is the usual measuring of
Carpenters) is less then the true content, by the Pyramide DSVOL, in which DO,
or SV, is half the difference of thicknes, and DS, or VO, one quarter of the
difference of breadths in both ends: and the height of it equal to half the
length.

For the two solides AFEHIKLM, BNZYIKLM, are apparently equal, again the two
solid wedges GSTPKL, PTVNKL are equal, and also the two solid wedges OCXVLM,
VXYZLM are equal. Now if you turn over the wedge GSTPKL, unto the lesser part
AFEHIKLM, it will ouer-reach in thickness, at the lesser end the quantity of
ER, and if you also turn over the wedge OCXVLM, unto the lesser part, you
shall find it to fill up the former ouer-reaching, and to make an exact
Parallelepipedon, the bases or ends whereof are equal to the middle Section
IKLM. but over and above those two wedges turned over, you shall have left the
Pyramide DSVOL, which was to be proved.

And in like manner if a round tapering solid, or piece of timber, be measured
by the middle Section, or circular base, I say, That the product thereof
multiplied by the length, shall be less then the true content, by a Cylinder,
the diameter of whose base, is equal to half the difference of the diameters
of the two bases: and the length is one third part of the whole length.

CHAP. IX. Concerning the Measuring, or Gauging of Vessels.
AWine, or Beer vessel, whether Pipe, Hogshead, Barrel, Kilderkin, or
Pirkin, and such like, is in form of a Sphaeroides, having the two ends
equally cut off: and accordingly may be measured thus.

Measure the two diameters of the Vessel, in inches, or else in tenth parts of
a foot, the one at the bung hole, the other at the head, and also the length
within. And by the diameters found, find out the circles; then add together
two third parts, of the greater circle, and one third part of the less:
Lastly, multiply the aggregate by the length: so shall you have the content of
the Vessel, either in Cubic inches, or cubic tenth parts of a foot.

Example. Suppose a vessel, having the Diameter at the bung 32 inches, and at
the head 18 inches, and the length 40 inches. The quadrat of 32 is 1024. and
the quadrat of 18 is 324: Say then evermore, 1 ^ 0^236 1024 ^ 536166, ^/3 the
circle at the bung ^ 1 ^ 0^618 324 ^ 84823, circle at the head. Or else by
Chap. 7, Sect. 4.

The aggregate of those two circles is 620989, which being multiplied by 40,
the length gives 2483956 cubic inches for the whole content of that vessel.

2 Mr. Edm: Gunter in his second book of the Cross Staff, Chap. 4.
pretending to show the manner of gauging Wine vessels, begins with these
words.

The Vessels which are here measured, are supposed to be Cylinders, or
reduced into Cylinders by taking the mean, between the Diameter at the head,
and the Diameter at the boungue, after the usual manner.

And according to this supposition, teaches to find a Gauge point, For a
gallon of wine, in that his imagined Cylindriacall vessel.

Because his words are cautelous, and subterfugious, we must a little examine
them; for if his way be true, my Rule before set down, though grounded upon
demonstration, cannot stand.

Well then, that reduction of a wine Vessel into a Cylinder, is either true,
or false; if it be true what need those ambiguities of Vessels which are here
measured: and are supposed to be, etc. and after the usual manner? if false
why is it not noted, but delivered as a Rule to confirm an error. And what
means, the mean between the Diameter at the head, and the Diameter at the
boungue? is it the mean Geometrical, or Arithmeticall, that is the mean
proportional, or that which equally differs from both? such shifting is
unworthy an Artist.

First therefore, Let it be the mean in respect of difference, which is equal
to half the sum of the two Diameters: I say that the Vessel cannot truly
be reduced to a Cylinder by such a mean Diameter. For seeing it is most
apparent that such a Vessel, is greater in the middle then at the ends, the
boords, or sides thereof, shall from the middle to the ends, go either
straight, and so the Vessel shall be as it were, two equal segments of Cones,
set base to base: Or else arching, and so the Vessel shall (as before I said,
and is commonly taken for a truth) be a Sphaeroides, having the two ends
equally cut of.

If it be considered as two segments of Cones: the measure by that mean
Diameter, or middle Section is quite false, as has been demonstrated in the
former Chapter, Sect: 16, 17. and will be given less then the true content,
although the sides go straight: much more then, if the sides go arching; for
that conuexnesse, must needs yield a greater capacity. And therefore in neither
can that manner of Gauging be true.

Again, if the mean Diameter be understood to be the mean proportional
between the two Diameters, it is much more false, for between any two
numbers, the mean Geometrical is less then the mean Arithmeticall.

Thus much I have thought good in this place ingenuously to signify to the
inexpert Learner, that he might not beguile himself with a prejudged opinion.

3. I have showed the measuring of vessels by the cubic inch: but our usual
reckoning is by the Gallon, and parts thereof. We must therefore do the best
we can, to inquire the true quantity of a Gallon in inch measure, which will
be difficult to do exactly, both because the Standards usually are not
straight sided, but a little arching, neither do they agree perfectly one with
another: but what partly by experience, both mine own, and others, which has
come to my sight; and partly by reasoning shall seem to me most probable, I
will not refuse to set down.

4 Our English Gallon is understood to be either in Ale measure, or Wine
measure: and these two measures not a little differing. And first we will
inquire about our Ale measure.

I my self have measured Bushels, and P^cks, which have exactly been fitted
to the Standards, and have still in my account found a Gallon to contain
better then 270 cubic inches, indeed much about 272, or 273 as precisely as I
could measure in a vessel not truly regular. Also my worthy friend Master
William Twine, who has undergone great pains and charge, in finding out the
true content of our English measures, gave unto me two several measures of an
Ale-gallon, and those in due consideration but little differing. The one was
found out by a brassen vessel made in manner of a Parallelepipedon, the base
whereof was exactly six inches square, and the sides divided into inches and
twentieth parts: into which vessel he pouring out a standard Gallon of Queen
Elizabeth, filled with water, found it therein to ari^e unto 7 inches, and 6
tenth parts: which being computed makes cubic inches 2736. The other was found
by taking the dimensions of that standard Gallon, which was made in form of a
segment of a Cone, but that the sides were a little arching: the dimensions
were thus; the Diameter of the top was inches 65: the Diameter of the bottom
was inches 5^: and the height of it was inches 98: which being cast up by Chap:
8, Sect: 15, will be found to contain cubic inches 26885: differing from the
former, only cubic inches 4: which difference might well arise through the
curuitie of the sides. These measures he did not only take himself, but to
give me satisfaction, showed me the experience in the said Vessel and
Standard: but the truth is, I observed the Standard, besides the arching of the
sides, to be not exactly circular within, nor the brimme of an even height,
nor the bottom plain: and in taking the height of the water in the Vessel,
our sight was not able to estimate the ascent thereof so precisely, that a
spoonefull of water, more or less, could breed any sensible difference.

What therefore shall we do in this difficulty? indeed look to the first
ground, and principle of our English measuring, from Barley corns. For the
length of 3 Barley corns taken out of the middle of the ear is an Inch, or
Vncia, that is a twelfth part of a foot. 3 feet make a Yard: and 16 feet and
an half, that is 5 yards and an half, a Perch, with which we measure our
land; for 40 perches is a Furlong, and 8 furlongs an English mile: and again
40 square perches is a Roodland, 4 roodland make an Acre. So then a Perch which
is feet 16, or yards 5 is as it were the beginning of all land measure in
length: and a square Perch which is feet 272, is as it were the beginning of
all land measure in the superficial content.

Now therefore seeing in Vessels a gallon is as it were the beginning of
Vessel measure (for a Pottell is but a diminatiue of it, and a quart, the
quarter) it is not unlikely that our wise Ancestors had such a consideration
also in solid measures, that as a square Perch (the beginning of Superficial
land measure) did contain 372 square feet and a quarter; so a Gallon (the
beginning of vessel measure) should contain 272 Cubic inches and a quarter.
And the rather seeing that the ancient Geographers, divide a foot into 4
Palms, a palm being 3 of our inches, as 3 feet are a yard. So that as the
side of a square Perch consists of yards 5, a Gallon also should consist, of
a number of Cubic inches the square side whereof is palms 5.

Wherefore saving the exact truth when it shall appear, and in the mean time
the more probable reasons of other men, I make bold to tender this my
conjecture, to the censures of more diligent Inquirers, That the measure of an
English Ale gallon should be a square Vessel of inch 16, or Palms 5 every
way, and 1 inch deep: that is 2722^ Cubic inches.

5. And this my opinion may peradventure receive some confirmation by the
inquiry of an English wiue Gallon.

M. Henry Briggs that learned Geometrician, and my very loving friend, made an
experiment, with a Cubicall vessel, which was 12 inches every way, which
having filled with water carefully measured, found it to contain 7 gallons and
an half wanting a moment, as he himself long since, being then of Gresham
College, signified to me. Now if it had contained exactly 7 gallons, and an
half, a wine gallon should have been 2304 cubic inches, but because it wanted
a little, the gallon must be somewhat bigger, for which moment therefore if you
will put 6 hundred parts of an inch, the wine gallon shall contain 231 cubic
inches.

Again M. Gunter in the place before mentioned shows, that the common
opinion is that at London, a Cylindriacall vessel, whose diameter is 38
inches, and length 66 inches, does contain 324 gallons: wherefore by this
account a gallon should be 231 cubic inches almost exactly, which in both so
nearly agreeing, we may well conclude, That an English wine gallon does
contain 231 cubic inches.

It is also commonly received, that the reason of the greatness of an Ale
gallon above the Wine gallon is, that because of the frothing of the Ale or
Beer, the quantity becomes less, and therefore such liquors that did not so
yield froth, as Wine, Oil, and the like, should in reason have a lesser
measure. If then we compare these two gallons together, we shall find that
27225 ^ 231 165 ^ 14 ^ which abatement might to our Ancestors, in apportioning
those measures, seem to be reasonable.

6 To find how many Cubic tenth parts of a foot are in a gallon, both of
beer, and Wine: or also in any number of Cubic inches.

Because there be in a Cubic foot, 1000 Cubic tenth parts, and 1728 Cubic
inches, say, 1728 (C 12) ^ 1000 (C 10) 27225 ^ 157^521 -- cubic tenth parts of
a Beer gallon.

And 1728 (C 12) ^ 1000 (C 10) 231 ^ 1336803 -- cubic tenth parts in a Wine
gallon.

Also 1728 ^ 1000 2483956 ^ 14374746, cubic tenth parts, are in the vessel
measured in Sect. 1.

7 And according to these measures so found, you may easily find the content
of a pint, or quart, or peck, or bushel, which two last are to be reckoned in
Ale measure.

8 The Content of a Vessel, being given in cubic inches, or in cubic tenth
parts of a foot, to find how many gallons it contains.

This is easily done if you divide the content given in inches, by 272^5 for
Ale measure: and by 231, for Wine measure. But if the content be given in
decimall parts of a foot divide it by 1575521 -- for Ale measure; and by
1336803 -- for Wine measure.

Example. How many wine gallons are in a vessel containing 2483956 cubic
inches, or 14374746 cubic tenth parts of a foot. Divide 2483956 by 231, or
divide 14374746 by 13368, and the quotient shall be 107^3 wine gallons.

CHAP. X. Concerning the Comparison of sundry Metals, in quantity and weight.
1 IF four pieces of Metalls, whereof the third is of the same kind with the
first, and the fourth of the same kind with the second, are proportional,
their grauities also, or weights, shall be proportional.

2. If there be four pieces of metal, whereof the third is of the same kind
with the first, and the fourth of the same kind with the second: and the first
and second be of equal greatness, and the third and fourth of equal weight;
the weights of the first and second, shall be reciprocal to the magnitudes of
the third and fourth.

3. Two Sphaeres of the same matter are in weight, as the cubes of their
Diameters, are in magnitude. Et contra.

4. Pieces of Metal if they be of equal magnitude, have their weights in
direct proportion, as is here set down: but if they be of equal weight, they
have their magnitudes in proportion reciprocal: According to the experiments
of Marinus Ghetaldi, in his tractate called Archimedes promotus.

Gold. 3990 Brass. 1890 Arg. Viu. 2850 Iron. 1680 Lead. 2415 Tin. 1554
Silver. 2030

5. To find the Weight of a Sphaere of Tin, having the Diameter 1 Inch, or
else ^ tenth part of a foot.

Take a piece of Tin, and turn it exactly in a Lathe, into a Cylinder,
having both the Diameters of its base, and also the length equal, to the
Diameter of the Sphere given. Then weight that Cylinder, that you may have the
weight thereof in grains: And lastly, take two third parts of the whole number
of grains: for the weight of the Sphaere.

After this manner Marinus Ghetaldi found a Cylinder of 1 inch, or twelfth part
of a foot thick, and long to weigh 1824 grains: whereof ^ is 1216, the weight
of a Sphaere of that thickness.

Again if you say, 1000 (C 10) ^ 1728 (C 12) 1216 ^ 2101248

You shall have the weight of a Sphaere whose Diameter is one tenth part of a
foot.

Wherefore also a Cubed inch of Tin weighs 23224 --, and a Cubed tenth part
of a foot weighs 40131 --

And note that Mar: Ghetaldi uses the ancient Roman foot, which by the measure
set down in his book seems to be very little less, then our-vsuall English
foot, if not exactly the same.

Note also that he divides one pound, into 12 ounces, and every ounce into 24
Scruples, and every Scruple into 24 grains: So that an ounce with him weighs
576 grains: and a pound 6912. Whereas our English pound of Iroy weight by
Assize, or Gold smiths weight, is but 5760 grains, and our ounce 480. But
whether the Raguzean grain, be the same with our English, I leave to be tried
by the diligent Practizer.

6 To find the Weight of a Sphaere of Tin, at any other Diameter assigned.

Multiply the Cube of the Diameter given by 1216, if it be in inch measure; or
by 2101248, if the measure be by decimall parts of a foot: and the product will
be the weight of that Sphaere.

And contrariwise to find the Diameter of a Sphaere of Tin, by the weight
given in grains. Divide the weight given in grains by 1216 if you would have
inch measure: or by 2101248 if you would measure by decimall parts of a foot,
and the quotient shall be the Cube of the Diameter.

7. To find the Weight of a Sphaere of any Metal, at any Diameter given,
either in Inch measure, or in decimall parts of a foot.

First by Sect. 6, seek the weight of a Sphaere of Tin, at that Diameter:
then by Sect. 4, say, As the proportional number of Tin, is to the
proportional number of that other Metal: so is the weight of the Sphaere of
Tin now found, to the weight of the Sphaere proposed.

Example. Suppose a Sphaere of Iron, whose Diameter is 3 inches; what shall be
the weight thereof?

First, the weight of a Sphaere of Tin, of 3 inches Diameter, will be found
to be 32832 grains. Then say, 1554 ^ 1680 32832 ^ 35494054 grains the weight
of the Sphaere proposed.

8 To find the Diameter of a Sphaere of any Metal in inch measure, or
decimall parts of a foot, the weight thereof being given.

First by the contrary of Sect. 6, seek the Cube of the Diameter of a Sphere
of Tin of that weight. Then by Sect. 4, say reciprocally. As the
proportional number of that other Metal, is to the proportional number of
Tin: so is the Cube of the Diameter now found, to the Cube of the Diameter of
the Sphaere proposed.

Example. A Sphaere of Iron weighs 354940^4 grains: how many inches is the
Diameter thereof?

First, the Cube of the Diameter of a Sphere of Tin of 35494054 grains
weight, will be 2918910695, then say, reciprocally, 1680 ^ 1554 2918910691 ^ 27
--

The Cubic root whereof is 3, the Diameter of a Sphaere of Iron of that weight
proposed.

CHAP. XI. Concerning the Ordering of Soldiers, in any kind of rectangular
form of battle.
1 Battles are considered either in respect of the number of men, or in
respect of the form of ground. As asquare battle of men is that which has
an equal number of men, both in Rank and File, though the ground on which they
stand, be longer on the File, then on the Rank. And a square battle of
ground is that which has the Rank as long as the F^le, though the men in
Rank be more then in File.

2. In respect of the number of men, it is called either asquare battle, or a
double battle, or a battle of the grand front, which is quadruple, or a
battle of any proportion, of the number in Rank, to the number in File.

3. If it be asquare battle of men: Extract the quadrat root out of the
whole number of men, and the same shall be the number of Soldiers, to be set
in a Rank.

Example. 576 Soldiers are to be martialled in a square battle, that so
many may be in Rank, as in File.

Take the quadrat root of 576, which is 24: the same shall be the number to be
placed in a Rank.

4. If it be a double battle of man: Extract the quadrat root out of half
the number of men, and the same doubled shall be the number of Soldiers to
be set in a Rank.

Example. 1458 Soldiers, are to be placed in a double battle; so that twice
so many may be in Rank as in File.

Take half the given number 1458, which is 729, the quadrat root whereof is
27: double it and you shall have 54 men to be placed in a rank.

5. If it be a quadruple battle, which is called of the great front: Extract
the quadrat root out of one quarter of the number of men, and the same
quadrupled shall be the number of Soldiers to be set in a rank.

Example. 1024 Soldiers are to be martialled into a battle of the grand
front, so that four times so many be in rank as in file.

Take one quarter of 1024 the number given, which is 256, the quadrat root
whereof is 16: quadruple it, and you shall have 64 men to be placed in a rank.

6. If a battle be required of any other form, that is, if a Ratio be
given, according to which the number of men in Rank, shall be to the number in
file. Multiply the two terms of the Ratio given: Then say As the product is to
the quadrat of the term which is for the rank, or As the term which is for
the file, is to the term which is for the rank: so is the whole number of
Soldiers, to the quadrat of the number of men to be placed in a rank.

Example. 1944 Soldiers, are to be martialled so, that the number of the
rank, be to the number of the file, as 8 unto 3, that is for 8 men in rank, 3
are to be set in file.

First multiply the two terms of the Ratio 8 and 3, the product whereof is 24,
also quadrat 8, the term of the rank, which will be 64. Then say, 3 ^ 8 1944
^ 5184 ^ out of which extract the quadrat root 72, and it will give you the
true number of the rank.

7. In respect of the form of ground, the battle is either a square of
ground, or longer one way then the other. For the distance, or order of
Soldiers martialled in array, is distinguished either into Open order, or
Order.

Open order is when the very centers of their places, are distant 7 feet
asunder, both in rank and file.

Order is when the centers of their places, are distant 3 feet and a half in
rank, and so much in file. Or else 3 feet and a half in rank, and 7 feet in
file: which last order, and whatsoever order else there is, in which the
distance of the ranks one from another is greater, then the distance of files,
causes that a square of men, makes not a square of ground, but the ground is
longer on the file then on the rank.

8 If it be a square battle of ground, the centers of the distances being
feet 3 in rank, and 7 feet in file. Because 3 is half of 7, the ratio of the
distances, is as 1 unto 2. And seeing the number in rank, to the number in
file, is reciprocal to the distances, the ratio of the number of men in rank,
to the number of men in file, shall be as 2 unto 1. And so the Rule shall be
the same with that in Sect. 6, namely, As the term of the file, is to the
term of the rank; so is the whole number of Soldiers, to the true number of
the rank.

Example, 1352 Soldiers, are to be set in a square of ground, that their
distances may be feet 3 in rank, and 7 feet in file.

The Ratio of the rank to the file, shall reciprocally be, as 7 to 3, that is
as 2 to 1. Say therefore 1 ^ 2 1352 ^ 2704, the quadrat root whereof 52 is the
number of men to be set in a rank.

9 If a battle wherein the distance in rank is unequal to that in file, be
longer one way then the other, according to any Ratio given: there is to be
considered a double ratio, one reciprocal in respect of the distances, the
other according to the form of the ground. Wherefore to find the Ratio of men
in rank, to the men in file, Multiply the two terms of the rank, for the
rank, and the two terms of the file, for the file. And then the Rule shall
be the same with that in Sect. 6, namely, As the term of the file, is to the
term of the rank: so is the number of Soldiers, to the quadrat of the true
number of the rank.

Example. 10290 soldiers, are to be set in a battle, so that they may stand
only 3 feet asunder in rank, and 7 feet in file, and the length of the ground
for the rank, to the length of the ground for the file, shall have the ratio
of 5 unto 2.

First in respect of the distances, the Ratio of Rank to file, reciprocally is
as 7 unto 3. Secondly, in respect of the ground, the ratio of rank, to file, is
as 5 to 2. Wherefore by multiplication of like terms, the true ratio of rank
to file shall be 7 x 5 to 3 x 2, that is as 35 to 6. Say therefore 6 ^ 35 10290
^ 60025 the quadrat root whereof is 245, the number of men to be set in rank.

10 If 1000 Soldiers, may be lodged in a square, of 300 feet, how many feet
must the side of a square be, which will serve to lodge 5000? Say, 1000 ^ 5000
300 x 300 ^ 450000 ^ the quadrat root whereof 671 -- is the square side sought
for.

And this is the order for resolution of all other questions of this sort.

CHAP. XII. A collection of the most necessary Astronomicall operations,
1 BEfore we deliver the Rules of such operations, it will not be
inconvenient, to set down certain Reductions, whereof we may have frequent use.

To reduce sexagesime parts into decimals. Divide the sexagesimes given by 60.

Example. How many decimals are 34, 12?

Here are required two reductions, first of the seconds into decimals of
minutes: then of the minutes with their decimals, into decimals of degrees,
Thus 60 ^ 1 12 ^ 02 Again 60 ^ 1 34 ^ 057 Wherefore 34, 12 are equal to 057
of a degree.

And contrariwise to reduce decimall parts of degrees in sexagesimes. Multiply
the decimall part given by 60.

Example. How many sexagesime parts are 057? 1 ^ 60 057 ^ 34^ Again 1 ^ 60 02
^ 12

To reduce hours into degrees. Multiply the hours with their decimall parts
by 15.

Example. How many degrees are 8Ho, 34, 12; that is by the former reduction
857Ho? thus 1 ^ 15 857 ^ 12855

Wherefore Hours 8, 34, 12 do contain 12855 degrees.

And contrariwise to reduce degrees into hours. Divide the degrees with their
decimall parts by 15.

Example. How many hours are in degrees 12855? 15 ^ 1 12855 ^ 857

2 It is to be understood, that if four numbers are proportional, their Order
may be so transposed, that each of those terms, may be the last in
proportion. In this manner,

I. As the first is to the second; so is the third to the fourth. II. As the
third is to the fourth; so is the first to the second. III. As the second is to
the first; so is the fourth to the third. IIII. As the fourth is to the third;
so is the second to the first.
Wherefore every proportion does implicitly contain four Orders, two
descending, and two ascending, as may be seen by their combinations: By one of
which orders, if of four proportional numbers, any three be given, that other
which is unknown, may be found out.

Example. To find out any of these,

terms 1 As the Sine of the complement of the suns declination, 2 is to the
Sine of the compl. of his altitude; 3 So is the Sine of the Suns Azumith from
the meridian, 4 to the Sine of the horary distance from the meridian.

If the first, second, and third terms be given, the fourth shall be found out
by the I order.

If the first, third, and fourth terms be given, the second shall be found out
by the II order.

If the first, second, and fourth terms be given, the third shall be found
out by the III order.

If the second, third, and fourth terms be given, the first shall be found out
by the IIII order.

the same aequinoctial point.

6. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the Radius 2 is to the Sine of the compl. of the longitude of the
Sun from the next aequinoctiall point; 3 So is the tangent of the Suns
greatest declination, 4 to the tangent of the compl. of the angle of the
Ecliptic with the Meridian.

7. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the Radius, 2 is to the Sine of the Suns greatest declination: 3
So is the Sine of the compl. of the Suns right ascension from the next
aequinoctial point, 4 to the Sine of the compl. of the Angle of the Ecliptic
with the Meridian.

8. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the Sine of the compl. of the Poles height, 2 is to the Radius; 3
So is the Sine of the Suns declination, 4 to the Sine of the Suns Amplitude
ortiue, that is the arch of the horizon from the place of the Suns rising or
setting to the true East, or West point.

9. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the Radius, 2 is to the Sine of the Suns greatest amplitude
ortiue, which is in the Tropic: 3 So is the Sine of the longitude of the Sun
from the next aequinoctial point, 4 to the Sine of the Suns amplitude ortiue.

Or also of these.

terms 1 As the Sine of the compl. of the Poles height, 2 is to the Sine of
the compl. of the Suns greatest declination: 3 So is the Sine of the Suns
longitude from the next aequinoctial point, 4 to the Sine of the Suns
amplitude ortiue.

10. To find out any one of these.

the tangent of the Suns declination, 4 to the Sine of the Suns Ascensional
difference.

Sine of the compl. of the Suns ascensionall difference.

13. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the tangent of the height of the pole, 2 is to the Radius: 3 So is
the tangent of the Suns declination, 4 to the Sine of the Suns horary
distance from the Meridian, being due East or West.

14. To find out any one of these.

16. To find out any one of these.

terms 1 As the Radius, 2 is to the Sine of the complement of the Poles
height. 3 So is the tangent of the Suns declination. 4 to the tangent of the
Suns Azumith from the North meridian, at 6 of the Clock.

17 The hour of the Suns Rising, and setting is found out by the
Ascensionall difference. For if you reduce the degrees of the Ascensionall
difference, into hours, it will show you how much the Sun rises, or sets
before, or after 6 a Clock.

18. The Oblique ascension also of the Sun is found out by the Ascensionall
diff^rence. For if you subduct the Suns Ascensionall difference, out of the
right ascension of the Sun, from the beginning of Aries, for the six
Northern signs which are,,,,,, or if you add it thereto, for the six
Southern Signs, which are,,,,,, you shall have the Suns oblique ascension.

19. The declination of the Sun, and his Altitude above the Horizon at any
time, together with the height of the Pole being given, to find the hour of
the day. Say,

As the Radius, is to the Sine of the complement of the Suns declination.

So is the Sine of the compl. of the Poles height, to a fourth number. Keep it,

Then out of the Suns distance from the North pole, subduct the complement of
the Pole; and of that remains, and the complement of the Suns altitude, take
both the Sum, and also the difference. And say again,

As the fourth before kept, is to the Sine of half that sum: so is the Sine
of half the difference, unto a number which being multiplied by the Radius, is
equal to the quadrat, of the Sine of half the Angle of the Suns horary
distance from the Meridian.

20. The declination of the Sun, and his altitude above the Horizon at any
time together with the height of the Pole being given, to find the Suns
Azumith. Say,

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of the Suns altitude. So the Sine
of the compl. of the Poles height, is to a fourth, Keep it,

Then out of the complement of the Suns altitude, subduct the complement of
the Pole; and of that remains, and the distance of the Sun from the North
Pole, take both the Sun, and also the difference: and say again,

As the fourth before kept, is to the Sine of half the sum: So is the Sine
of half the difference, unto a number which being multiplied by the Radius, is
equal to the quadrat of the Sine of half the angle of the Suns horizontall
distance from the Meridian.

21. To find the length of the Crepusculum, or Twilight.

Between the light of the day, and the darkness of the night, the Twilight
is set by the wise Creator; that we here upon the earth might not in an
instant, pass from one extreme into another, but by successiue degrees. The
Twilight is nothing else but the refraction of the Suns beams, in the
densitie of the air. And Pet-Nonnius to find the length of the Twilight,
watched the time after Sun set, when the twilight in the West was shut in, so
that no more light appeared there, then in any other part of the sky near the
Horizon: then by one of the known fixed Stars, having taken the true hour of
the night, found by many observations, that at the time of shutting in the
Twilight, the Sun was under the Horizon 18 degrees, and until the Sun was
gone so low, the Twilight continued. Say therefore

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of the Suns declination:

So the Sine of the compl. of the height of the Pole, is to a fourth, Keep it.

Then out of the Suns distance from the South Pole, subduct the complement of
the Pole; and of that remains, and degrees 62, take both the Sum and also
the difference; and say again,

As the fourth kept, is to the Sine of half the sum: so is the Sine of half
the difference, to a number which being multiplied by the Radius is equal to
the quadrat of the Sine of half the angle of the Suns distance at the ending
of the Twilight, from the high Noone next to it.

Wherefore if out of the whole angle converted into hours, you subduct half
the diurnall arch, or the hour of the Suns setting, you shall have the true
length of the Crepusculum, or Twilight.

22. To find the length of the least Crepusculum in the year.

The Sun being in the winter Tropic makes the longest Crepusculum, of the
whole winter half year, and from thence, as the days increase, the
Crepuscula do decrease until they come to be shortest, which is in a
certain Parallel, between that Tropic, and the Aequinoctiall: the declination
whereof is thus found out.

As the tangent of the complement of the Pole, is to the Sine thereof: So is
the tangent of 9 degrees, to the Sine of the declination of the Parallel, in
which the Sun makes the shortest Crepusculum of the whole year.

23 But before the Crepusculum come to be shortest, there is another Parallel,
in which the Crepusculum is equal to that in the Aequinoctiall: the
declination whereof is thus found out.

As the Radius is to the Sine of the altitude of the Pole: So is the Sine of 18
degrees to the Sine of declination of the Parallel in which the Sun makes
the Twilight equal to that in the Aequinoctiall.

24. If an Arch of the Ecliptic, be equal to his Right ascension, one end
thereof being known, to find out the other end. Say,

As the Sine of the Compl. of the declination of the arch given. is to the
Radius: so is the Sine of the compl. of the greatest declination, to the Sine
of the compl. of the other and.

25. To find the point of one quadrant of the Ecliptic, wherein the difference
of longitudes cease to be greater, then the differences of the right ascensions.

Multiply the Sine of the complement of the greatest declination, by the
Radius, and out of the product extract the quadrat root: the same shall be the
Sine of the complement of the declination sought for.

26. To find the quantity of the angles, which the circles of the 12 Howses
make with the Meridian. Say

As the Radius is to the Tang. of 60 degr. for the 11th, 9th, 5th, and third
hours, or to the Tang. of 30 degrees. for the 12th, 8th, 6th, and second howses;
so is the Sine of the complement of the Pole, to the tang. of the compl. of any
house with the Meridian.

And note that on the Eastern part of the upper hemisphaere, there are three
circles of Howses, the Horoscope, which is also the Horizon, and next to that
is the circle of the 12th House, then the circle of the 11th House. On the
Western part also, are three circles of Howses, the circle of the 7th House,
which also is the Horizon, and next thereto the circle of the 8th House, then
the circle of the 9th House. But the circle of the 10th House, is the very
upper Meridian it self. Contrary Howses are 1 and 7, 2, and 8: 3 and 9: 4 and
10: 5 and 11: 6 and 12.

27. Resolve the whole time from the Noone last past into degrees (by
multiplying the hours with their decimall parts by 15, according to Sect: 1)
which add unto the right Ascension of the Sun: and you shall have the right
ascension of the point of the Equator in the upper Meridian, which is called
the Right ascension of Medium coeli.

28. Add 99 degrees to the Right ascension of Med. Caeli: and it shall be the
degree of the Equator then rising upon the East Horizon.

29. If the first quadrant of the Equator do arise, the beginning of g is
distant from the meridian Eastward, so much as is the distance of the Right
ascension of Med. coeli, from 360. But if the second qua^rant of the Equator
do arise, the beginning of g, is distant from the Meridian Westward, so much
as is the distance of, from the Right ascension of Med. coeli.

And in both of them the lower angles of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, on
the East side is obtuse, and on the West side acute: and the 90th degree of the
Ecliptic, commonly called non agesimus gradus, is on the East part.

30. If the third quadrant of the Equator do arise, the beginning of is
distant from the Meridian Eastward, so much as is the distance of the Right
ascension of Med. coeli from 180. But if the fourth quadrant of the Equator
do arise, the beginning of, is distant from the Meridian Westward, so much as
is the distance of 180, from the Right ascension of Med. coeli.

And in both of them the lower angle of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, on the
East side is acute, and on the West side obtuse: and on the 90th degree is on
the West part.

31. The point of the Ecliptic culminant in the Meridian, which is called
Medium coeli, or Cor coeli, and is the cuspis of the 10th house, may be found
by Sect. 5.

32. The declination of the said culminant point, may be found by Sect. 3.
Wherefore also by adding or subducting that declination, to, or from the
elevation of the Equator, (which is the complement of the Pole) the Altitude
of Med. coeli may be had.

33. The Angle of the Ecliptic with the Maridian, may be found by Sect. 7.

34. To find the Altitude of the 90 degr. Or the Angle of the Ecliptic with
the horizon.

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of the altitude of Med: coeli. So
is the Sine of the angle of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, to the Sine of the
compl. of the angle sought for.

35. To find the Azumith of 90 degr. which is also the Amplitude ortiue of the
Ascendent, or Horoscopus.

As the Radius, is to the Sine of the Altitude of Med. coeli. So is the tang.
of the Angle of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, to the tang. of the compl. of
the distance of that Azumith from the Meridian.

36. To find the Horoscopus, or Ascendent degree of the Ecliptic, Or the
Cuspis of the first house.

The Distance of the Azumith of 90 degrees from the Meridian, is equal to the
Amplitude ortiue of the Ascendent degree. Wherefore the Ascendent degree or the
Ecliptic, may thence be found, by Sect: 8, or 9. Or else thus.

As the Radius is to the Sine of the complement of the angle of the Ecliptic
with the Meridian: So is the tang. of the complement of the altitude of Med.
Coeli, to the tangent of the distance of Med. coeli from the Ascendent degree.

37. To find the parts of the angle of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, cut with
an arch perpendicular to the Circle of any of the Howses. Say

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of the altitude of Med. coeli: so
is the tangent of the circle of any House with the Meridian, to the tang: of
the compl: of the part of that angle, which is next the Meridian

Then subduct that part found out of the whole Angle for the remaining or
latter part.

38. To find the Distance of the cuspis of any house, from Med: coeli. Say

As the Sine of the compl. of the later part of the angle of the Ecliptic with
the Meridian, is to the Sine of the compl: of the former part of that angle: So
is the tang* of the altitude of Med: coeli, to the tang: of the distance of the
cuspis of that House sought for.

39. To find the Altitude of the Pole above any of the circles of the Howses.

First find out the Angle which the circle of the House proposed makes with
the Meridian, by Sect: 23: And then say.

As the Radius is to the Sine of the angle of the circle of the House with the
Meridian: So is the Sine of the height of the Pole above the Horizon of the
place, to the Sine of the height of the Pole above that circle of position.

40. The longitude, and latitude of any fixed Star being given, to find out
the Right ascension, and Declination thereof.

The angle which the Circle of the Suns longitude makes with the Meridian,
at the Pole of the Ecliptic, I call the Angle of longitude.

And the angle which the Circle of the Suns Right ascension, makes with the
Meridian at the Pole of the world, I call the Angle of right Ascension. The
condition and quantity of which two angles, is thus found out.

In Stars of the Northern latitude
If the longitude be in the I quadrant of the Ecliptic: subduct it out of 90:
the remains will be the angle of longitude, acute. And the Angle of Right
ascension, being found, must be added unto 270.

If the longitude be in the II quadrant: subduct 90 out of it: the remains
will be the angle of longitude, acute. And the Angle of right ascension being
found must be taken out of 270.

If the longitude be in the III quadrant: subduct 90 out of it, the remains
will be the angle of longitude, obtuse. And the Angle of right ascension being
found, must be taken out of 270.

If the longitude be in the IIII quadrant, subduct it out of 90+360: the
remains will be the angle of longitude, obtuse. And the Angle of right
ascension being found, must be added unto 270.

In Stars of the Southern latitude
If the longitude be in the I quadrant, subduct 270 out of it + 360: the
remains will be the angle of longitude, obtuse. And the Angle of right
ascension being found, must be taken out of 90.

If the longitude be in the II Quadrant, subduct it out of 270: the remains
will be the angle of longitude, obtuse. And the Angle of right ascension being
found, must be added to 90.

If the longitude be in the III quadrant: subduct it out of 270; the remains
will be the angle of longitude, acute. And the Angle of right ascension being
found, must be added to 90.

If the longitude be in the IIII quadrant: Subduct 270 out of it: the remains
will be the angle of longitude, acute. And the Angle of right ascension being
found, must be subducted out of 90x 360.

Then say,

As the Radius, or total Sine, is to the Sine of the complement, or excess of
the angle of longitude:

So is the tang. of the compl. of the latitude, to the tang. of the first base.

If the angle of longitude be obtuse; unto the first base found, add the
greatest declination degrees. 23: and the sum shall be the second base; and the
angle of right ascension shall be acute.

But if the angle of longitude be acute; out of the first base subduct the
greatest declination: and the remains shall be the second base. And the angle
of right ascension shall be obtuse.

Or else out of the greatest declination of the Sun, subduct the first base;
and the remains shall be the second base: and the angle of right ascension
shall be acute.

Say again,

As the Sine of the second base, is to the Sine of the first base:

So is the tang. of the angle of longitude, to the tang. of the angle of right
asce^sion.

Whence by adding or subducting as was before delivered in the conditions of
those angles, shall be given the Right ascension of that Star sought for.

Lastly say

As the tang. of the second base, is to the Radius:

So is the Sine of the compl. or excess of the angle of right ascension to the
tang. of Declination.

Where note that if the second base exceed 90 degr: the declination found,
shall not be of the same kind, that the latitude is, but in the contrary
Hemisphaere.

41. The longitude, and latitude of any two Stars being given, to find their
distances.

If the Stars have both the same longitude, differing only in latitude; the
difference of latitude, is the distance of the stars.

And if they differ only in longitude having the same latitude; Say

As the Radius, is to the Sine of half the difference of longitude:

So is the Sine of the compl. of the latitude given, to the Sine of half the
distance of the Stars.

But if they differ both in longitude, and latitude, whether the latitudes be
both of the same kind, or one Northern, and the other Southern. Take the
difference of both the stars, from the pole of the Ecliptic, toward which
the star having the greater latitude is. And say,

As the tang. of the compl. of the lesser distance from the pole, is to the
Radius:

So is the Sine of the compl. or excess of the difference of longitudes, to
the tang. of the first base.

Take this first base out of the greater distance from the pole, and the
remains shall be the second base, Then say,

As the Sine of the compl. of the first base, is to the Sine of the compl. of
the second base:

So is the Sine of the compl. of the lesser distance from the pole, to the Sine
of the compl. of the distance of the two Stars.

If any man will take pains to calculate (by this last Rule) the distances of
some noted stars of the first, second, and third magnitudes, round about the
heavens, which are not above 5, or 6 degrees, at the most, one from the other:
and shall keep them written in his book: they may serve as a Rule, or
Instrument, whereby he may reasonably estimate with his eye, the distance of
any Planet, or Comet, or other apparition from a known fixed star, not very
far remote: by comparing the distance which he would know with some of those
known distances which he shall find, either to be equal, or else to have some
proportion thereto.

42. The longitude, and latitude of any two Cities being given, to find their
distance.

The manner of the operation is the very same with the former, unto which
therefore I refer the Reader: only will note, that in the heavens, the
longitude and latitude is taken in respect of the Ecliptic, which being the way
of the Sun, all the stars in their proper motion, have reference unto it, as
unto their measure and rule. But in the Earth the principal Circle is the
Equinoctial, dividing it into the Northern, and Southern he misphaeres. And
therefore in the earth, the longitude, and latitude is reckoned by the
Aequinoctiall.

The distance of two places upon the Earth, being found in degrees, may be
converted into English miles, by taking 60 miles for every degree, and one mile
for every minute.

43. To find at what hour a fixed star comes into the Meridian any day.

Seek the Right ascension of the Sun, for that day, by Sect (...); and
subduct it out of the Right ascension of the Star. And reduct the degrees
remaining into hours, by Sect: 1. The same shall show how long time from the
Noone before, the same star shall come into the Meridian.

Wherefore if at any time of the night, a Starr whose Right ascension is
known, be in the Meridian, the hour of the night is easily found.

44. The height of any known Star above the Horizon, being by any means
given, to find the hour of the night.

First seek out the hour of that stars coming into the Meridian the same
day, by Sect. 43. Again seek out the horary distance of that starr from the
Meridian, according to Sect: 19. And then if the starr be on the East side,
not yet come to the Meridian, take the difference of those two numbers; but if
the star be past the Meridian, take the Sum of them, for the hour of the
night.

45. The height of the Pole being given to find the coming of any fixed
Star, in the due East, or West. Say

As the Radius is to the tang: of the stars declination: So is the tang: of
the compl: of the Pole, to the Sine of the compl. of the Stars horary
distance from the Meridian.

46. The height of the Pole being given, to find the Altitude of any fixed
starr above the Horizon, being due East or West. Say,

As the Sine of the height of the Pole, is to the Radius: so is the Sine of the
Stars declination, to the Sine of the Altitude, at due East or West.

47. By the Altitudes of any two known fixed stars taken when they are both
in the same Azumith, to find the height of the Pole.

First say,

As the Sine of the difference of the stars altitudes, is to the Sine of the
difference of their Right ascensions: so is the sine of the nearer stars
distance from the apparent Pole, to the Sine of an angle to be kept.

Again compare the furthest stars distance from the Pole with the distance
from the Zenith, and say

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of the Angle kept: so is the tang:
of the lesser of the compared arches, to the tang: of the first base.

Subduct the first base out of the greater of the two compared arches; and the
remains shall be the second base.

Then lastly say,

As the Sine of the complement of the first base, is to the Sine of the compl.
of the second base: so is the Sine of the compl. of the lesser of the two
compared arches, to the Sine of the height of the Pole.

48. To find out the horizontall Parallax of the Moon.

First the distance of the Moon from the Center of the earth must be known in
Semidiameters of the earth: which unto them that are acquainted with the
Theorie of the Planets, is not very difficult. And whereof peradventure, I may
hereafter teach the practice, by most easy and exact instruments, which I have
long since framed.

Say,

As the distance of the Moon, from the center of the earth, is to the
Semidiameter of the earth: So is the Radius, to the Sine of the Moons
horizontall parallax in that distance.

49. The horizontall Parallax of the Moon being given, to find her Parallax in
any apparent altitude.

As the Radius, is to the Sine of the altitude of the Moon: so is the Sine of
the horizontall Parallax, to the Sine of the Parallax in that altitude.

50. The place of the Moon in the Ecliptic having little or no latitude (as in
the Eclips of the Sun) together with her Parallax of altitude being given, to
find the Parallaxes of her longitude, and latitude.

If the Moon be in the 90th degree of the Ecliptic: she has no Parallax of
longitude, and the Parallax of latitude, is the very Parallax in that altitude.

But if the Moon be not in the 90th degrees. say,

As the Radius is to the tang. of the angle of the Ecliptic with the horizon:
So is the Sine of the compl. of the distance of the Moon, from the Ascendent,
or descendent degree of the Ecliptic, to the tang. of the compl. of the angle
of the Ecliptic with the Azumith of the Moon.

Again say,

As the Radius is to the Sine of that angle: So is the Parallax of the Moons
altitude, to the Parallax of her latitude.

Lastly say,

As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of that former angle: So is the
Parallax of the Moons altitude, to the Parallax of her longitude. which is to
be added to the true motion of the Moon, if she be on the East part of the
90th degree of the Ecliptic: or to be subducted out of it, if she be on the
West part.

Many other Astronomicall and Geographicall problemes might be added. But
because it is impossible to set down all, which may be of use, at some time or
other: I have in the next Chapter delivered briefly the doctrine of triangles
fitted unto practice: with all the several cases belonging thereto.

CHAP. XIII. Of Trigonometria, or the manner of calculating both Plain, and
Sphaericall triangles. And first concerning certain general notions, and
rules necessary thereto.
IN every triangle both Plain, and Sphaerical, the greater side subtendeth the
greater angle. And the greater angle has the greater side opposite unto it.
Also the greater angle lies to the lesser side, and the greater side has the
lesser angle lying unto it.

In every plain triangle, any two angles being given, the third is also given:
and one of the angles being given, the sum of both the other two is given.
For all the three angles together, are equal to two right angles, that is to
180 degrees.

In a plain rectangle triangle, one of the acure angles is the complement of
the other. Where note that when the complement is named without any other
addition, it is meant of the arch, which is wanting of a quadrant of that
circle, or 90 degrees. In like manner the excess is meant of the arch, which
is above a quadrant. But when it is said the complement to a semicircle, it is
understood of so many degrees as will make up 180.

But in a Sphaericall rectangle triangle, one of the oblique angles is always
greater then the compl: of the other.

If two arches together make up a Semicircle, the excess of the greater arch,
is equal to the complement of the lesser.

The same Right Sine, and the same Tangent, and Secant, does belong both to the
arch it self, and also to the complement of it to a Semicircle. But their
versed Sines differ: For the versed Sine of an arch less then a quadrant, is
equal to the difference of the Radius, and the Sine of the complement of that
arch: and the versed Sine of an arch greater then a quadrant, is equal to the
sum of them. And the versed Sine is thus found out, As the Radius is to the
Sine of half the arch; so is the Sine of that half arch, to half the versed
Sine of the whole arch.

In a right angled triangle both Plain, and Sphaericall, one of the sides
containing the right angles, is called the Base, and the other the Cathetus:
and the fide subtending the right angle is the Hypotenusa. And know that every
rectangled triangle, is most fitly noted with the letters ABC; so that BA may
be the Base, and CA the Cathetus, and BC the Hypotenusa: and B the angle at the
base, and C the angle at the Cathetus, and A the right angle. Likewise every
oblique-angled triangle with the letters BCD; so that out of the angle C a
perpendicular CA, being let down, it may in the base BD distinguish the two
cases BA and DA, which are the bases of the two particular triangles into which
it is cut. And in noting the triangles with letters, observe diligently, that
if any angle be given together with one of the sides including it, the same
angle be noted with B; and the side with BC.

If both the angles at the Base BD be acute, the perpendicular CA shall fall
within the triangle: And BD = BA + DA that is BD is equal to the sum of BA
and DA. And if the angle B be obtuse, the perpendicular CA shall fall without
the triangle, beyond the obtuse angle B: And BD = DA - BA, that is BD is equal
to the excess of DA above BA or if the angle B. be obtuse, the perpendicular
CA: shall fall without the triangle beyond the obtuse angle D: And BD = BA -
DA, that is BD is equal to the excess of BA above DA. The lesser case being
still taken from the greater angle.

And note that this sign +, or pl (that is plus) shows that the magnitude
before which it is set, is affirmed and positive in nature; and therefore to
be added. And that this sign -- or mi (that is minus) shows the magnitude
before which it is placed, is denied, and privative in nature; and therefore to
be subtracted, as you may see in those former examples.

Again, some magnitudes are taken severally and apart; as s BA, that is the
Sine of the Base; s co BC, that is the Sine of the complement of the
Hypotenusa; t B, that is the tangent of the angle ABC at the base; t co C, or t
co ABC, the tangent of the complement of the angle at the Cathetus: So also
VqZ, that is the quadrat side of the plain Z. And some magnitudes are taken
universally, and then they are included in pricks: as ^: that is the Sine of
half the arch, which is composed of the sum of the two arches DC, and BD,
abating thereout the arch BC. So also Vq Z x X that is the quadrat side of the
two plains Z and X put together: also Vq Q in R Or Vq Q x R that is the
quadrat side of a rectangular plain, the two sides whereof are the lines Q and
R, or some fourth proportional already found, and the Radius, or Semidiameter,
which is the total Sine. For by the sign in, or x, I use to express
multiplication.

When any triangle is given to be resolved by Trigonometrie, note the parts
thereof (either-sides or angles) which are given and known, with a little line
drawn cross each such part: and note the unknown part which is sought for
with a little circle.

And if a triangle Sphaericall (be it right angled or oblique-angled) proposed
has two sides each of them severally greater then a quadrant: you shall in
resolving thereof, keep the least side with the least angle opposed to it: and
for the two other both sides, and angles, take the complements of them to a
semicircle.

Lastly, if a triangle with all the three angles given, be required to be
converted into a triangle having the three sides given. You shall for the
greatest angle of the triangle proposed, and for the greatest side subtending
it, take the complements to a semicircle; keeping the other two lesser angles,
with their subtendent sides as they are.

CHAP. XIIII. Of the Nocturnall Dials.
THere are in the Instrument, two several Nocturnall Dyals. The innermost of
them is fitted to the star in the rump of the great Bear, commonly called
Aliot. The other is composed of 12 several stars: whose names you shall
find written within, near to the center.

The outermost circle of the Nocturnall Dyall is divided into twice 12 hours:
each hour being subdivided into quarters, and are noted with figures belonging
to the hours, as may be seen in the Instrument.

The middlemost circle of the Nocturnall is divided into 12 months, having
their names written: each month being distinguished into tenth days with
longer lines; and into fifth days with shorter lines. And if the Instrument be
large enough, each day of the months throughout the year, may be noted with
pricks.

In the innermost circle are the divisions and names of 12 fixed stars: which
are these.

The bright star in the head of. the Bulls eye the latter shoulder of Orion the
little dog the heart of the Lion the tail of the Lion Spica Virginis the
North balance the head of Ophiuchus the heart of the Vultur the mouth of
Pegasus the tip of the wing of Pegasus.
To find out the hour of the night by Aliot.
Seek the day of the month in the annual circle of the Nocturnall: and apply
the Index thereto: mark what hour it cutteth, in the hour circle. Remember
this hour for all that day: then at night when you would find out the hour,
hold up your Instrument by the handle, and move it up and down, till you see
the pole star through the middle hole, and the star called Aliot by the
limb: Set the Index or labell to Aliot, and mark what hour the labell
cutteth, for if unto this hour you add the hour kept in mind for that day,
the sum of both shall give you the true hour of the night: so that you cast
out 12 hours, from the said sum if it shall chance to be more.

Example. If on the 15th of November you would find the hour of the night by
the star Aliot. Apply the Index to the day of the month, and it will cut in
the hour circle 8 and an half: then suppose the Index being set to the star
Aliot, as above taught, does cut in the hour circle 10. these two numbers
being added together, the sum will be 18, out of which subduct 12; and the
remains 6, will be the true hour of the night.

To find out the hour of the night by the Inner Nocturnall Dyall.
To perform this it is necessary that you know the true Meridian of the place
wherein you are, and can find it out by night, which you may thus do. Having
a Meridian line drawn in some window, or other convenient place (as is showed
in the Second part of this book, Use 19) stick up therein a long needle
perpendicularly, and watch till the Sun casts the shadow of the needle,
upon the Meridian line. Or else in a true Sun Dyall observe when the shadow
falls just on 12 a clock, for then is the Sun in the Meridian. Wherefore go
instantly into some place about your house where you may see some mark, either
a chimney, or the corner of an house, or else some tree, or such like, directly
between you and the Sun: then have you the true Meridian.

Or otherwise you may in a clear night go into some plain place near your
house, and setting up a straight pole perpendicularly on the ground, go a good
distance from it Southwards; and then move up and down, till you see the top
of your pole, directly between your eye, and the North polar star: then set
up another pole perpendicularly between your feet, so that both your poles,
and the Polar star, may be in one right line. And then going back again to
your first pole, look what known star is directly over your last pole, for
that star is in the Meridian. You may therefore instantly go to some
convenient place, and take a mark whereby you may at all times know the
Meridian as is before taught.

When therefore at any time of the night you would know what a clock it is,
go to that place where you stood, and looking directly over your mark, see if
any of the 12 fixed stars, be in the Meridian; or if none of them be
therein, observe which two of them are on either side thereof, and what part of
that space is in the Meridian. Then go into the light, and take your
instrument, and set the Index to that star, or point which you saw in the
Meridian: mark what hour it cutteth, for that same hour being added to the
hour, which the day of the month shows, shall give you the true hour of
the night: so that you cast out 12 hours, from the said sum, if it shall
chance to be more.

Example. Suppose the fifth of December, that the middle point of the space
between the bright star in the head of Aries, and the Bulls eye, be in the
Meridian. Set the Index to the middle point of the space between those two
stars in the Instrument: and it will cut in the hour circle 2 and an half:
then again set the Index to the fifth of December, and in the hour circle it
will cut 7: which added unto 2 and an half, gives 9 and an half, for the true
hour of the night.

Another example. Suppose the 19th of December, that one third part of the
space between the Bulls eye, and the right shoulder of Orion, be in the
Meridian. Set the Index to one third part of that space in the Instrument, and
it will cut in the hour circle 4 and half a quarter almost: again, set the
Index to the 19th of December, and in the hour circle it will cut 6, which
being added unto 4, and half a quarter almost, gives 10 and almost half a
quarter for the hour of the night.

THE SECOND PART OF THIS BOOK.
Showing the use of the Second side of the Instrument, for the working of most
questions, which may be performed by the Globe: And the declination of Dyals,
upon any kind of Plain.
Upon the second side of the Instrument, is delineated the proiection of the
upper Hemisphaere upon the plain of the Horizon: The Horizon it self is
understood to be the innermost circle of the limb: and is divided on both
sides, from the points of East, and West into degrees, noted with 10, 20, 30,
etc. unto 90. And the center of the Instrument is the Zenith, or Vertical point.

Within the Horizon, the middle straight line, or Diameter pointing North and
South, is the Meridian, or 12 a clock line: and the other shortarching lines,
on both sides of it are the hour lines, distinguished accordingly by their
figures. These hour lines should indeed be drawn through the whole plain,
crossing one another in the Pole of the world: but that the Instrument may be
more fair, they are only drawn short.

And because diverse excellent uses, do require the total delineation of the
hour circles, I have in a several paper, inscribed entirely, both the hour
lines, and also two other circles between them, containing every one five
degrees. (But if the Instrument were large enough to receive them, it were best
if every degree had his circle: and so every 15 circle should be an hour
line.) And of the parallels, there needs no more, but the Aequinoctial, and
both the Tropics.

For as much as there will be great use of this paper Instrument; I have in the
24 Use showed the manner of making it: so that any that 1^ ingenuous, and ready
handed may himself delineate one sufficient enough to serve his turn, for any
elevation.

The two arches which cross the hour lines meeting on both sides in the
points of intersection of the six a clock lines with the Horizon, are the two
Semicircles of the Ecliptic, or Annual circle of the Sun: the upper of
which arches serves for the Summer half year, and the lower for the Winter
half year: and are therefore divided in 365 days: which are also
distinguished into 12 months with longer lines, having their names set down:
and into tenthes, and fifthes with shorter lines: and the rest of the days
with pricks: as may plainly be seen in the Instrument.

And this is for the ready finding out of the place of the Sun every day: and
also for showing of the Suns yearly motion: because by this motion the Sun
goes round about the heavens in the compass of a year, making the four
parts, or seasons thereof. Namely the Spring, in that quarter of the Ecliptic
which begins at the intersection on the West side of the Instrument, and is
therefore called the Vernall intersection. Then the Summer in that quarter of
the Ecliptic which begins with the intersection of the Meridian in the
highest point next the Zenith. And after that Autumn in that quarter of the
Ecliptic, which begins at the intersection on the East side of the
Instrument, and is therefore called the Autumnall intersection. And lastly, the
Winter in that quarter of the Ecliptic, which begins at the intersection
with the Meridian, in the lowest point next the Horizon.

But besides this yearly motion, the Sun has a Diurnall or daily motion,
whereby it makes day and night with all the diversities, and inequalities
thereof: which is expressed by those other circles drawn cross the hour
lines: the middlemost whereof being grosser then the rest, meeting with the
Ecliptic in the points of the Vernall, and Autumnall intersections, is the
Aequinoctiall: and the rest on both sides of it, are called the Parallels, or
Diurnall arches of the Sun: the two outermost whereof are the Tropics,
because in them the Sun has his furthest digression, or Declination from the
Aequinoctiall, which is degrees 23: and thence begins again to return to
the Aequinoctiall. The upper of the two Tropics next the center (in this our
Northern Hemisphaere) is the Tropic of Cancer: and the Sun being in it, is
highest into the North, making the longest day of Summer. And the lower next
the Horizon, is called the Tropic of Capricorn; and the Sun being in it, is
lowest into the South, making the shortest day of Winter.

Between the two Tropics, and the Aequinoctiall infinite such parallel circles
are understood to be contained: for the Sun is what point soever of the
Ecliptic it is carried, describes by his lation, a circle parallel to the
Aequinoctial. Yet those parallels which are in the Instrument, though drawn
but to every second degree of Declination, may be sufficient to direct the eye,
in imagining and tracing out, through every day of the whole year in the
Ecliptic, a proper circle, which may be the Diurnall arch of the Sun for
that day. For upon the right estimation of that imaginary parallel, does the
manifold use of this Instrument especially rely: because the true place of the
Sun, all that day, is in some part, or point of that circle. Wherefore for
the better conceiving, and bearing in mind thereof, every fifth parallel, is
herein made a little grosser then the rest.

I Use. And thus by the eye, and view only, to behold and comprehend the course
of the Sun, both for his Annual and Diurnall motion, may be the first use of
this Instrument.

II Use. To take the height of the Sun above the Horizon.

Set up the pin, (which is therefore made fit for the hole at the center)
perpendicular in the center: and put the Indices on both sides, down upon the
Meridian, that they with their weight, may not sway the Instrument any way as
it hangs: then with a thread put into the hole above in the handle, hang it
perpendicularly, bearing the edge toward the Sun, that the pin may cast a
shadow, upon the degrees in the limb: for that degree which the shadow of the
pin cutteth in the limb, is the height of the Sun above the Horizon, at
that present.

III. Use. To find the Declination of the Sun every day.

Look the day of the month proposed in the Ecliptic, and mark how many
degrees the prick showing that day, is distant from the Equinoctial, either on
the Summer, or Winter side, viz North, or South.

Example. I. What will the Declination of the Sun be, upon the 11th day of
August? Look the 11th day of August: and you shall find it in the sixth Circle
above the Aequinoctiall: now because each Parallel, stands (as has been
said before) for 2 degrees, the Sun shall that day decline North-wards 12
degrees.

Example. II. What Declination has the Sun, upon the 24th day of March?
Look the 24th day of March, and you shall find it, between the second, and
third Northern parallels, as it were an half and one fifth part more of that
distance from the second: reckon therefore 4 degrees for the two Circles, and
one degree for the half space: so shall the Suns declination be 5 degrees,
and about one fifth part of a degree Northward, that same day.

Example. III. What Declination has the Sun upon the 13th day of November?
Look the 13th day of November, and you shall find it below the Equinoctial,
ten parallels and about one quarter, which is 20 degrees, and an half
South-wards. So much is the Declination. And according to these examples judge
of all the rest.

IIII. Use. To find the Right ascension of the Sun every day.

Imagine an hour line through the day of the month given, and mark in what
point it will cr^sse the Aequinoctiall: then lay a Ruler, or a straight Scroule
of paper, to the Pole of the world (noted in the Instrument with P W) and that
same point. For the Ruler shall in the innermost Circle of the limb, of the
South side, cut the Right ascension of the Sun for that day, to be reckoned
from the West, to the point of intersection, for the first, or upper Semicircle
of the Ecliptic: or from the East together with 180, for the second, or lower
Semicircle of the Ecliptic.

V. Use. To find the longitude of the Sun, or in what degree of the Sign he
is every day.

The Pole of the first Semicircle of the Ecliptic is noted P I. and the Pole of
the second Semicircle is noted P I I. Lay a Ruler, or a straight Scroule of
paper, to the day of the month, and the proper Pole of the Semicircle of the
Ecliptic, in which it is: for the Ruler shall in the innermost Circle of the
limb, on the South side, cut the degree of the Suns place in the Ecliptic,
reckoning it in the same manner as you did in finding the Suns Right
ascension: and the Arch thus found is called the longitude of the Sun. which
may be expansed into signs, by reckoning on the limb, from the West to
South,,, and from South to East,,: then back again from East to South,,; and
lastly from South to West,, allowing 30 degrees, for each of those twelve
signs.

VI. Use. To find the Diurnall Arch, or Circle of the Suns course every day.

The Sun every day by his motion (as has been said) describes a Circle
parallel to the Aequinoctiall, which is either one of the Circles in the
Instrument, or some-where between two of them. First then seek (...) of the
month; and if it fall upon one of those (...), that is the Circle of the
Suns course that same day: But if it fall between any two of those
Parallel^, imagine in your mind, and estimate with your eye, another Parallel
through that point, between those two Parallels, keeping still the same
distance from each of them.

As in the first of the three former Examples, The circle of the Suns course,
upon the 11th day of August, shall be the very sixth Parallel above the
Aequinoctiall toward the Center.

In Example II. The Circle of the Suns course upon the 24th day of March,
shall be an imaginary Circle between the second, and third Parallels, still
keeping an half of that space, and one fifth part more of the rest from the
second.

In Example III. The Circle of the Suns course upon the 13th day of November,
shall be an imaginary Circle, between the tenth, and eleauenth Parallels,
below the Aequinoctiall, still keeping one quarter of that space from the tenth.

VII. Use. To find the Rising and Setting of the Sun every day.

Seek out (as was last showed) the imaginary Circle or Parallel of the Suns
course, for that day, and mark the point where it meets with the Horizon,
both on the East and West sides thereof, for that is the very point of the
Suns rising, and setting that same day, and the hour lines which are on both
sides of it, by proportioning the distance reasonably, according to 15 minutes,
for the quarter of the hour, will show the hour of the Suns rising, on the
East side, and the Suns setting on the West side.

VIII. Use. To know the reason, and manner, of the Increasing, and Decreasing
of the days and nights throughout the whole year.

When the Sun is in the Aequinoctiall, it rises, and sets at 6 a Clock,
for in the instrument, the intersection of the Aequinoctiall, and the Ecliptic
with the Horizon, is in the 6 a clock Circle on both sides. But if the Sun
be out of the Aequinoctiall, declining toward the North, the intersections of
the Parallel of the Sun with the Horizon, is before 6 in the Morning, and
after 6 in the Evening: and the diurnall Arch of the Sun, greater then 12
hours; and so much more great, the greater the Northern Declination is.
Again if the Sun be declining toward the South, the intersections of the
Parallel of the Sun with the Horizon, is after 6 in the Morning, and before 6
in the Evening; and the diurnall Arch lesser then 12 hours; and by so much
lesser, the greater the Southern Declination is.

And in those places of the Ecliptic in which the Sun most speedily changes
his Declination, the length also of the day is most altered, and where the
Ecliptic goes most parallel to the Aequinoctiall changing the Declination but
little, the length of the day also is but little altered.

As for example, when the Sun is near unto the Aequinoctiall, on both sides,
the days increase, and also decrease suddenly and apace: because in those
places, the Ecliptic inclines to the Aequinoctiall in a manner like a straight
line, making sensible declination. Again when the Sun is near his greatest
Declination, as in the height of the Summer, and the depth of Winter, the days
keep for a good time, as it were at one stay, because in those places the
Ecliptic is in a manner parallel to the Aequinoctiall, scarce altering the
declination: and because in those two times of the year, the Sun stands as
it were still, at one declination; they are called the Summer Solstice, and the
Winter Solstice. And in the mean spaces, the nearer every place is to the
Aequinoctiall, the greater is the diversity of days.

Wherefore we may hereby plainly see, that the common received opinion, that
in every month, the days do equally increase, is erroneous.

Also we may see that in Parallels equally distant from the Aequinoctiall, the
day on the one side, is equal to the night on the other side.

IX. Use. To find the Ascensionall difference of the Sun every day.

Seek out the time of the Suns Rising, or Setting that same day (by the VII
Use) and see how much it differs from six a clock, then convert the same
difference into degrees (as was taught in 1 Part. Chap. 12. Sect. 1.) by
multiplying the hours with their decimall parts, by 15. And so have you the
Ascensionall difference for that day.

X. Use. To find out the Oblique ascension of the Sun every day.

Seek out the Suns Right ascension (by the IIII Use) and the Ascensionall
difference (by the IX Use:) And if the Sun be in the first Semicircle of the
Ecliptic, Subduct the Ascensionall difference, out of the Right ascension: But
if the Sun be in the second Semicircle of the Ecliptic, add the Ascensionall
difference to the Right ascension: and you shall have the oblique ascension.

XI. Use. To find how far the Sun rises, and sets, from the true East
and West points, which is called the Suns Amplitude ortiue, and occasiue.

Seek out (as was showed in the VI. Use) the imaginary Circle, or Parallel of
the Suns course, and the points of that Circle in the Horizon, on the East,
and West sides, cutteth the degree of the Amplitude Ortiue, and occasiue.

XII. Use. To find the length of every day and night.

Double the hour of the Suns setting, and you shall have the length of the
day; and double the hour of the Suns rising, and you shall have the length
of the night.

XIII. Use To find the true place of the Sun, upon the Instrument, which
answers to the point, wherein the Sun is in the heavens: and is the ground
of all the questions following.

Take with your Instrument the height of the Sun, and reckon it on the
moveable Index, or Labell: and then move the said Labell, till you find the
height of the Sun, exactly to fall upon the Parallel of the Sun for that
day, on the East side if it be in the Fore-noone, and on the West side, if it
be in the Afternoon; the point of intersection, where the Index, or Labell
crosses the Parallel, in that point of the Suns altitude, shall be the true
place of the Sun on the Instrument.

XIIII. Use. To find the Hour of the day.

The true place of the Sun on the Instrument (found out as was last showed)
shows among the hour lines the true hour of the day.

XV. Use. To find out the Azumith or vertical Circle in which the Sun is, or
the Horizontall distance of the Sun from the Meridian.

The Index or Labell fastened at the Center, is a moveable Azumith: apply
therefore the edge thereof, unto the true place of the Sun on the instrument
(found out as was showed by XIII. Use.) And mark what point of the Horizon, or
Limb, the same edge of the Labell cutteth; reckon how many degrees of the
H^rizon, are intercepted between that point, and the Meridian line, or South
point, either on the East, or West side: and that Arch shall be the Horizontall
distance sought for, whereby is showed the Azumith of the Sun at that
instant: and consequently the Angle which the vertical Circle, or Azumith of
the Sun makes with the Meridian.

XVI. Use. The Azumith of the Sun being known, to find out the Altitude of
the Sun, and the Hour of the day.

Set the edge of the Labell to the Azumith given, and mark in what point the
same edge crosses the Parallel of the Sun for that day: that point of
intersection shows the height of the Sun above the Horizon, upon the
Labell: and also it shows the hour of the day among the hour lines.

XVII. Use. To find at what hour the Sun comes to be full East, or West
every day in Summer.

Apply the edge of the Labell, unto the East, or West points of the Limb, and
mark in what point, the said edge cutteth the Parallel of the Sun for that
day, for that same point among the hour lines, shall show the time of the
Suns coming to be full East, or West in that day, and likewise of what
altitude the Sun will be above the Horizon, at that time of his being full
East, or West.

XVIII. Use. To find the height of the Sun at high Noone every day, and
likewise at every other hour.

Mark in what point the Parallel of the Sun for that day, cutteth the line
of that hour, for which you would know the Suns altitude: And unto that
point of intersection, apply the edge of the moveable Labell, or Index: and
thereon shall you find, the very degree of the Suns altitude, at that hour.

By this XVIII Use, and by the XVI, are made the Quadrants, described by Gemma
Frizius, Munster, Clauins, Mr. Gunter, and others: and also all manner of
Rings, Cylinders, and inuumerable other topicall Instruments, for the finding
out of the hour, and other like conclusions. And likewise the reason, of
finding the hour of the day, by a man's shadow, or by the shadow of any Gnomon,
set up perpendicular to the Horizon, or else parallel to it.

XIX. Use. To find out the Meridian line, and the points of the compass
without a Magneticall needle, yea more exactly then with a needle.

Take the height of the Sun, by the shadow of the pin: and apply the same
height, reckoned on the Index, or Labell to the parallel of the Sun for that
day, whereby you have the true place of the Sun, in the instrument, as has
been showed in the XIII. Use. Then keeping both the Labell at that point, and
the pin upright in the Center, hold, or set your instrument parallel to the
plain of the Horizon, with the pin toward the Sun, and move it gently,
till the shadow of the pin shall fall, exactly upon, the fiduciall edge of
the Labell. For then the Meridian line of the instrument, shall be in the true
Meridian of the place: and the four quarters of the instrument, shall look
into the four cardinal points, of East, West, North, and South. Wherefore if
with a bodkin, you make a prick at each end of the Meridian of your instrument
where it stands: and with a Ruler draw a line through them: the same shall
be the Meridian of that place.

This is a most excellent practice, for finding out the Meridian in any place,
and is in an instant performed, and that easily. And hereby you may examine the
Variation of the Compass. And also exactly place any Sun Dyall.

XX. Use. Consid^rations for the use of the instrument in the night.

In such questions as concern the night, or the time before Sun rising, and
after Sun setting, the instrument represents the lower Hemisphaere, wherein
the Southern Pole is elevated. And therefore the Parallels, which are above
the Aequinoctiall, shall be for the Southern, or Winter Parallels, and those
beneath the Aequinoctiall, for the Northern, or Summer parallels. And the East
shall be accounted for West, and the West for East: and the North shall be
accounted for South, and the South for North: contrary to that which was
before, when the Instrument represented the upper Hemisphaere.

XXI. Use. To find how many degrees the Sun is under the Horizon, at any time
of the night.

Seek the declination of the Sun for the day proposed: and at the same
declination, on the contrary side, imagine a Parallel for the Sun that night:
and mark what point of it is in the very hour and minute proposed: then set
the Index, or Labell to that point of the Parallel, and it will show you
thereon the degree of the Suns depression under the Horizon.

XXII. Use. To find out the length of the Crepusculum, or Twilight every day.

Because the question concerns the night time, you must seek out the Suns
Parallel, for the night, on the other side of the Aequinoctiall, having the
same declination with that which the day of the month shows: then move about
the Labell, until the said Parallel cutteth the edge thereof in the 18th degrees:
on the West side for the Morning Twilight, and on the East side for the Evening
Twilight, of the same day.

And note that in the height of Summer, the Twilight in our Horizon, continues
all night long: because the same goes not under the Horizon, full 18 degrees

XXIII. Use. To find the Declination of any Wall, or Plain.

Take a board having one straight edge, and a line drawn perpendicular unto
that edge: apply the straight edge unto the Wall, at what time the Sun
shines thereon, holding the board parallel to the plain of the Horizon: and
hang up a thread with a plummet, so that the shadow of the thread may fall on
the board, crossing that perpendicular line. Then take with your Instrument the
height of the Sun, and instantly make two pricks, in the shadow of the thread
on the board, a good way distant one from the other: and laying a Ruler to
those two pricks, draw a line, which line shall be the Azumith of the Sun, on
the board: again with the height of the Sun lastly taken, find out on your
instrument, the Azumith of the Sun; or the Angle which the Suns Azumith
makes with the Meridian, (by the XV. Use.) And on the board taking the
intersection of the shadow line with the perpendicular for the Center, describe
a Circle equal to the innermost Circle of the Limb: (which you may easily
do, if you set one foot of your compasses upon the East, or West point, and
extend the other foot unto 60 degrees, on the same innermost Circle, for this
distance is equal to the Radius thereof.) Again with your compasses, take of
the Arch between the Azumith of your Instrument, and the Meridian, and set
that on the Circle of the board, that way that the true South is: and through
the end of that Arch measured on the board, draw a straight line for the
Meridian. Lastly take with your compasses, the Arch intercepted between the
Meridian on the board, and the perpendicular line, and by applying it to the in
most Circle of the limb, from the East, or West points see how many degrees it
contains: for that is the declination of the Wall. Or else you may find the
Meridian upon the board, by XIX Use.

If the Angle of the Meridian with the perpendicular, on the board, be a right
Angle, the Wall is direct East, or West.

But if the Meridian fall upon the perpendicular, or be parallel there to
making no Angle with it, the Wall is direct North, or South.

XXIIII. Use. The Art of Dyalling. And first how to make the Instrument in
paper, promised in the beginning of this second part.

For the Delincation of this instrument in paper, it will be necessary first
to show the manner how the Semidiameter is to be graduated, or divided into
degrees: and how the Centers, and Semidiameters, of the several kinds of
Arches are to be found.

Upon half a sheet of strong large Dutch paper, (the larger, the better) draw
two straight lines, making a right Angle near one of the corners, the one
through the length, and the other through the breadth of the paper; which two
lines I therefore call the longer, and the shorter perpendicular.

Upon the right Angle point, being the Center, with a Semidiameter equal to
that by which you intend to delineate your instrument, describe a quadrant of a
Circle: and on the point where it meets with the shorter perpendicular, draw
a long tangent line parallel to the longer pependicular.

Divide the Quadrant into 90 degrees, among which from the beginning at the
shorter perpendicular, reckon the elevation of the Pole, for which you will
make your instrument, and applying a Ruler to the end thereof, and to the
Center, where the Ruler cutteth the tangent line make a prick. And taking with
your compasses the distance from the Center to that prick, measure it upon the
shorter perpendicular: this shall be the Semidiameter of the sixth hour Circle.
At the end thereof draw another long line parallel also to the longer
perpendicular.

Then out of the Center unto the second parallel through every degree of the
quadrant, draw fine straight lines, cutting also the first Parallel. The
intersection of those lines with the first Parallel, shall be The scale of
centers of Arches. And their intersection with the second Parallel shall be The
scale of centers of hour Circles. And the segments of those lines, intercepted
between the Center, and the first Parallel, shall be the Semidiameters of
Arches: and the whole lines between the Center and the second Parallel, shall
be The Semidiameters of hour Circles. And that you may know for what Circle,
every Center, and Semidiameter serves, you shall note every fifth line from the
beginning, with the figures 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. Set under the second Parallel,
unto 90 which will fall upon the longer perpendicular: that so you may readily
find the Center, and Semidiameter of any Circle required.

Again divide the first 45 degrees of the Quadrant in the midst: and
applying your Ruler to the Center, and to every one of those half divisions,
where in each place the Ruler cutteth the first Parallel, or tangent line, make
a prick. So shall you have upon the tangent line between the shorter
perpendicular and the midlemost line 45, a third scale, which is, The scale of
90 degrees, for the graduating of the Semidiameter of your instrument on the
paper: In which you shall also distinguish every fifth degree, with figures set
under the tangent line.

Having thus prepared your paper of scales with lines neatly and exactly
drawn, keep it by you to have it still in a readiness for the making, and
using of the Instrument in paper. The making whereof is thus.

Take with your compasses the Semidiameter of the Quadrant in your paper of
scales: and therewith upon a piece of strong Dutch paper, Describe the
Horizontall Circle: which you shall cut into two Semicircles with a Meri^ian
line drawn through the Center: divide them into Quadrants in the points of
East, and West: and each Q^adr^nt into 90 degrees to be marked with figures
just as is done in the Instrument.

Then with your compasses take the elevation of the pole upon the scale of
degrees in your paper: and set it upon the Meridian line from the Center which
way you please: that shall be the intersection of the Aequinoctiall with the
Meridian. Also reckon the complement of the height of the Pole, upon the scale
of Centers of Arches, and with your compasses take the distance from the end
thereof to the Center: the same shall be the Semidiameter of the Aequinoctiall,
to be drawn from the East point of the Horizon through the point of
intersection with the Meridian unto the West point.

Again take with your compasses upon the scale of degrees in your paper the
complement of the height of the Pole: and set it upon the Meridian on the other
side of the Center from the Aequinoctiall: there shall be the Pole of the
Aequinoctiall, or of the World, in which all the hour lines shall cross one
another.

Nextly unto the height of the Pole both add, and also subduct 23 degrees: and
with your compasses take both those Arches in the scale of degrees: and set
them in the Meridian from the Center, one falling beyond the Aequinoctiall, and
the other short of it: those shall be the intersections of the two Tropics with
the Meridian. Seek diagram also by Sect: 8, Chapt: 12 of the first part, the
Amplitude ortiue of the Sun, having 23 degrees declination: and reckon it being
found, in the Horizontall Circle from the East and West points both ways:
those are the points of intersection of the Tropics with the Horizon on both
sides: and so having three points in each Tropic, you may easily through them
draw the Circles.

Moreover with your compasses, take the distance between the Center and the
second Parallel in your paper, which is the Semidiameter of the sixth hour
Circle: and set it on the Meridian from the Pole beyond the Aequinoctiall: that
shall be the Center of the sixth hour Circle: upon which you may draw the same
Circle, from the East point of the Horizon through the Pole to the West point.
Then through the center of the sixth hour Circle erect a line perpendicular to
the Meridian, extending it infinit^y on both sides of the Meridian: and in that
line both ways, prick down the Centers of the horary Circles, out of the
scale in paper: And lastly opening your compasses from every one of those
Centers unto the Pole severally, describe all the horary Circles, or at least
every fifth of them, and so is your paper instrument perfectly finished.

The use of this instrument on paper is, that lines, and arches may be
designed upon it with a fine pennicell of black lead, and afterward be wiped
out again. Wherefore it will be needful for him that will use this
instrument, to all the purposes thereof, to get a good pair of large compasses
with three points, ^ne sharp, another for ink, a third for black Lead. And I
suppose it would do well to fast ^n over your instrument a piece of thin
oyled paper, through which the lineaments may be conspicuous: and upon it to
trace such lines, and arches as you have occasion to use: that so your
instrument may be kept clean, and last longer.

For as much as in delineating the horary Circles, which are within 30 degrees
of the Meridian, the Semidiameters will be too long for your compasses: you may
in that straight thus help your self. First say, As the Radius, is to the
Sine of the Elevation of the Pole; So is the tang: of the distance of any
Horary Circle from the Meridian, suppose 25, or 20, or 15, or 10, or 5 degrees,
to the arch of the Horizon between the Meridian, and that horary Circle.

Reckon this distance on the limb of your Instrument from both ends of the
Meridian, and mark it. Thus do for the 25th, 20th, 15th, 10th, and 5th horary
Circle on both sides of each end of the Meridian.

Then in any piece of clean paper, through the midst of the longer way, draw
aline: and toward one end which (I call the upper end) cross the same with a
perpendicular line exactly equal to the Diameter of your Instrument, the point
of Intersection being the center.

Take with your Compasses out of the paper of scales, the semidiameter of 60.
degr: (which you may well do for an ordinary instrument): and setting one foot
on either end of the Diameter, that point wherein the other foot shall cut the
first long line, make your Center, and thereon draw an Arch through both ends
of the Diameter, and cutting the upper part of the first long line: this Arch
is equal to that horary Circle, which is distant from the Meridian 30 degrees
the complement of 60.

diagram

Divide each half of the Diameter into 3 equal parts, with 4 points, and from
every of those points unto the Arch draw lines parallel to the first long line.
And having divided every one of those five parallel lines intercepted between
the Diameter and the Arch into 6 equal parts, for the 6 times 5 degrees which
remain to the Meridian, draw through those divisions from the ends of the
Diameter (with a smooth and even hand) the Arches 25 20, 15, 10 and 5.

Those Arches you may transfer from the paper to your instrument in this
manner. Rubb the back side of the paper against the Arches, with fine powder
of black lead: then applying the paper with Arches to your instrument, that
the ends of the Diameter may exactly fall upon the two opposite marks, in the
limb of your instrument, which serve for the horary Circle that you would
draw, either 25, 20, 15, 10, or 5, trace over that Arch with the point of any
hard piece of wood sharpened: and the black lead on the back side will upon
the instrument leave the print of that Arch.

XXV. Use. To set an upright Wall or plain upon the instrument: and to find
how many hours the Sun shall shine thereon at some time of the year.

The situation of Walls, or Plains is considered either in respect of the
Meridian, or of the Horizon. And unto both it is either perpendicular, or
oblique, or parallel.

The plain perpendicular to the Meridian, is that which stands directly
North, or South: which if it be also perpendicular to the Horizon, is called
North, or South direct upright. But if it stoop from the Zenith forward, it is
called North, or South inclining: if backward, it is called North or South
reclining. And note that in a stooping Plain that side which is toward the
Horizon, is inclining, and that which is toward the Zenith is reclining.

The Plain oblique to the Meridian is that which stands not directly North,
or South, but declineth one side into the East, and the other into the West:
and is therefore called Declining Eastward, or Westward, according as either
side of the Plain looks: As if an upright Wall being Southern, declineth
from the South into the East, it is called South declining Eastwards upright.
But if it be not upright, it is called South declining Eastward, and inclining,
or reclining.

The Plain parallel to the Meridian, is that which looks directly East, or
West; and accordingly, has his denomination, whether it be Upright,
Inclining, or Reclining.

The Plain Parallel to the Horizon, is called Horizontall: and is represented
by the instrument it self, or at least by the inner most Circle of the limb
thereof.

And note that the Arch of Declination, is reckoned from the next East, or West
point. And that the Arch of Inclination, or Reclination is reckoned from the
Zenith, or the complement of it from the Horizon. So that every upright Plain
is understood to pass through the Zenith, which in the instrument is the
Center.

And thus having showed the several affections of Plains, we will now
proceed to show the manner how to set them upon the Instrument.

A Direct North, or South upright Plain, is represented in the instrument by a
line drawn through the Center from the East point to the West, which is also
the Horizontall intersection of the Pla^ne. And by it you shall see that the
Southern side or face of the plain is open to all the hours between six in
the morning and six in the evening. And that about London, the Northern side,
only in the Summer enjoys the Sun from his rising till after seven in the
morning: and from before 5 a clock in the afternoon, till his setting.

A direct East, or West upright plain, is represented in the Instrument by the
Meridian, which is also the Horizontall intersection of the plain. And in it
you shall see that all the forenoone hours are open to the East side: and all
the afternoon hours to the West side.

A Declining Plain is thus set upon the Instrument, reckon on the Horizon the
arch of Declination, from the East, or West point: and at the end draw a line
through the Center unto the opposite point of the Horizon: So that each side
thereof may be open to that point, either East, or West, into which the
Declination is supposed. That line so drawn throught the center is the
Horizontall intersection of the plain, and represents the plain it self,
if it be upright. For example, there is about London an upright Wall declining
Eastwards 35 degrees: which I would set upon the Instrument. Hold the Southern
part of the Instrument to you, and reckon from the East backward into the North
upon the Horizon 35 degrees: there draw a line through the Center: this line
shall not only upon the South side represent a Southern Plain declining
Eastward 35 degrees. But also upon the North side shall represent a Northern
Plain declining Westward 35 degrees. And moreover it will appear that on the
Southern side shall be drawn the hours from almost 4 a clock in the
morning, till 3 in the afternoon. And that in the Northern side shall be
drawn upon one side 4 a clock in the morning only: and upon the other side
all the hours from 3 in the afternoon till Sun set.

And ^o consequently the declination of an upright wall, or Window being given,
it may be found at what hour the Sun upon any day in the year will come to
that Wall, or Window, and when it will go from it. As in the former example,
There is about London a Northern wall declining Westward 35 degrees. I would know
at what time of the day the Sun will begin to shine upon it on the 24th day
of March. Set the Index at 35 degrees: from West toward South: and because that day
the Suns Declination is 6 degrees Northward; Look at what hour the sixth
Parallel above the Aequinoctiall toward the Center meets with the Index so
placed: and you shall find it at 3 ^ clock in the Afternoon. Wherefore at that
time the Sun will begin to shine upon the Wall that same day.

The Poles of every upright Wall are in the Horizon 90 degrees: that is a quarter
of a Circle, distant from the line representing the Plain. Wherefore if upon
that line in the Center you erect a perpendicular, the ends thereof in the
Horizon shall be the poles of that Plain: and are so far distant from the
North and South points, as the Plain it self is from the East, and West.

XXVI. Use. To set an Inclining, and Reclining Wall, or Plain upon the
Instrument: and to find how many hours the Sun shall shine thereon, at some
time of the year.

When you have an Inclining, or Reclining Plain to be described on the
Instrument. First the Horizontall intersection is to be set thereon, as if it
were upright; together with the line perpendicular thereto, in which are the
Poles of the Plain: according as was taught in the XXV Use.

Then upon the scale of degrees in your paper, reckon the arch of Inclination,
or Reclination; and with your compasses take, and set it in your Instrument
upon the line perpendicular to the Horizontall intersection of your Plain,
from the Center that way into which the Inclination, or Reclination tends:
the same shall be the uppermost point of your Plain.

Again, with your Compasses take the Complement of inclination, or
reclination, both upon the scale of degrees, and also upon the scale of centers
of arches in your paper: and set both spaces upon the same perpendicular line,
but on the other side of the center (extended if need be): At the shorter of
those spaces shall be the pole of your plain: and at the longer of them shall be
the Center of it.

Lastly, setting one foot of your Compasses in the center of your Plain, and
extending the other foot to the uppermost point, describe in your Instrument an
Arch of a Circle: which if you have done well, will exactly fall upon the ends
of the Horizontal intersection of your Plain. That Arch shall represent your
Plain, inclining upon the lower side, which is toward the Horizon, or Limb:
but reclining upon the vpper-side, which is toward the Zenith, or Center. And
so either side shall show in what hour lines the Sun, at some time of the
year, will shine upon it: that in delineating a Dyall thereon, it may not be
combered with unnecessary hour lines. For Example, suppose that the former
Plain, which with the South declined Eastward 35 degrees: do also incline 41 degrees:
30 min. Wherefore also with the North side it shall decline Westward 35 degrees:
and Recline 41 degrees: 30 min. Describe this plain upon your Instrument with an
Arch of a Circle, found out as was taught last before. And it will appear that
upon the Inclining side shall be drawn all the hour lines from almost 4 in
the morning, to 4 in the afternoon: And upon the Reclining side shall be
drawn first 4 and 5 in the morning: and then beginning at 0 a clock, all
hours to Sun set.

And note that in all Northern plains, the North Pole is elevated: and in all
Southern plains the South Pole is elevated. Except such North inclining, and
South reclining Plains, that in the Instrument fall below the North Pole,
between it and the Horizon: For in them the contrary Pole is elevated. And
also that a direct East and West plain, if it Recline, has the North Pole
elevated: and if it Incline, the South Pole.

XXVII. Use. The Plain being set upon the Instrument, to find the distances of
the hour lines, and Substile from the Horizontall Intersection. And also the
height of the Style above the Substile.

Every Dyall either has a Center in which all the hour lines, together with
the Substile, and Style do meet: or else it has no center, and so they are al
parallel one to another.

If the Plain being set upon the Instrument, cutteth the Pole of the
Aequinoctiall (that is the point in which all the horary Circles cross the
Meridian) the Dyal to be drawn upon that Plain shall have no Center. But if
it cutteth not the Pole, the Dyal shall have a Center. And of these Dyals with
Centers we will first entreat: as being most proper for the use of the
Instrument.

Behold therefore the Pole of your plain heedily what horary Circle it falls
upon: Or if it fall between any two, the distance of each being reasonably
apportioned, imagine a horary Circle passing through it. Mark in what point
that horary Circle, either real, or imagined, does cut the Plain, that same
point shall be the place of the Substile in your Plain: and the height of the
Style above it, is the Arch of that horary Circle intercepted betwixt the Pole
of the Aequinoctial, and the point of the Substile noted in the Plain.

Therefore applying a Ruler to the Pole of your Plain, carry it about unto all
the intersections of the Plain with the hour Circles, and the substile
severally: and where in every place the Ruler shall cut the innermost Circle of
the Limb, there make a visible mark: For the arches of the Limb intercepted
between the Horizontall points of your Plain, and every one of those marks,
shall be the distance intended to be sought.

But for the Horizontall plain, the ends of the hour Circles in the Limb of
your instrument, do give the distance without any more ado.

Concerning the height of the Style above the Substile: It is apparent by the
instrument, that in a Horizontal dyal, the 6 a clock line lies directly East
and West: and the Meridian perpendicular to it, directly North and South. And
that the Meridian is the Substile. And that the height of the Style above the
Substile, is equal to the height of the Pole in that place.

It is also apparent, that in all direct North and South Dyals, the 6 a clock
Line is drawn parallel to the Horizon, and the Meridian perpendicular to it:
And that the Meridian is the substile. And that the height of the Style above
the substile, if the Plain be upright, is equal to the complement of the
height of the Pole. But if it be North inclining, or South Reclining, it is
equal to the difference, of the height of the Pole, and the Arch of
Inclination, or Reclination. And if the Plain be North Reclining, or South
Inclining, it is equal to the Sum of the complement of the height of the
Pole and of the Arch of Inclination, or Reclination. And if the Plain fall
upon the Aequinoctiall, the style shall stand up perpendicular upon it in the
Center: and the hour lines shall be drawn all at equal Angles, viz. 15
degrees one from another.

In such Dyals as have not the Meridian for the substile, the height of the
Style above the Substile is thus sound by the Instrument. It was showed before
that the height of the style above the substile is the Arch of the horary
Circle through the Pole of the Plain, intercepted between the pole of the
Aequinoctiall, and the point noted in the Plain for the substile. Therefore
from the Horizontall points, or intersections of that horary Circle reckon 90
degrees both ways: and thereto through the Center draw an obscure line: in
which line shall be both the Inclination of that horary Circle, which is the
distance of the intersection, or uppermost point thereof from the Center: and
also the Pole. Then with your compasses take that distance, or Inclination: and
setting it upon the scale of degrees in your paper, see how many degrees it
contains upon that scal^. Again upon the same scale take with your compasses
the complement of that inclination or distance, which being set upon the
obscure line on the other side of the Center, shall show the Pole of that
horary Circle. Lastly applying a Ruler to the Pole of that horary Circle, and
both to the Pole of the Aequinoctiall, and to the point of the substile in the
Plain severally: mark where in both places the Ruler cutteth the innermost
limb of your instrument: For the degrees of the limb intercepted betwixt
those marks, shall be the height of the style, above the substile, which was
sought for.

And by this which has been taught you shall find that in an upright Dyall
declining, as before 35 degrees: from the South into the East, or from the North
into the West, the substile shall fall upon that horary Circle, which is about
3 degrees: after 9 a clock in the morning: and the style elevated above the
substile about 31 degrees: And also that in a South Dyall declining Eastward 35
degrees: and inclining 41 degrees: 30 min: Or in a North declining Westward 35 degrees: and
reclining 41 degrees: 30 min: the substile shall fall upon that horary Circle which
is about 8 degrees after 6 a clock: and the style elevated above the substile
about 63 degrees. 30 minutes.

XXVIII. Use. The making of all manner of plain Dyals with Centers.

I have already showed how to find out in our Instrument the distances of all
the hour lines, and the substile, from the Horizontal intersection. Now the
delineating of a Dyal is nothing else but to transfer those distances out of
your Instrument into the Dyal plain, every one in his due situation: and then
through them, out of the Center, to draw such hour lines as shall be of use,
together with the substile.

The due situation of those distances upon the Dyal plain, depends on the
true placing of the Meridian, or 12 a clock line: for that being truly
described, all the rest will be easy enough.

First therefore I will show the manner how the Meridian, or 12 a clock line,
is to be described.

Take in your Dyal some point for the Center, where you shall think fit: and
through it draw a line parallel to the plain of the Horizon. Cross it in the
Center with a perpendicular line. And having opened your compasses to the
length of the Semidiameter of your paper Instrument, describe on the Center a
Circle equal to the innermost Limb thereof. In which Circle the line parallel
to the Horizon is for the Horizontal intersection: and the other for the line
perpendicular to it: and the Circle it self represents the plain: Mark
therein the East and West sides of the Plain with E and W.

In the Horizontal, and in all North and South direct Plains, both upright, and
stooping; and in all upright declining plains, the Meridian is perpendicular
to the Line parallel to the Horizon.

In North ^^clining, and South reclining plains, the Meridian is to be drawn
on that side of the Dyal plain either East, or West, into which the
declination is: But in North inclining and South reclining, on the contrary
side. And if the plain be Northern, the Meridian shall be above the Line
parallel to the Horizon: and if the plain be Southern, it shall be under it.
And if the contrary Pole be elevated, it shall be drawn through the Center
into the opposite Quadrant of the Circle in your Dyal plain.

Lastly in a direct East and West plain, both inclining and reclining, the
Meridian is the same with the line parallel to the Horizon.

Wherefore with your compasses take the distance in the limb of your
Instrument, from the next Horizontall point, unto the mark of the Meridian;
and measure it upon the Circle of the Dyal plain, in that part, and on that
side, according as in consideration of the elevated Pole, and of the quality
of the Plain, was showed to be agreeable. And at the end of that arch, through
the Center, draw a line for the Meridian.

Again with your compasses take the distances in the limb of your Instrument,
between the mark of the Meridian, and the marks of all the hour Lines
severally: and setting them upon the Circle of the Dyal plain orderly from the
Meridian, the Forenoone hours on the West side of it, and the Afternoon
hours on the East side: at the end of every one of those arches draw the hour
Lines: and distinguish them with their proper figures accordingly.

Lastly fasten the style in the Center, so that it may hang perpendicular unto
the plain in the Substile, at the just height. And because the style in every
Dyal is understood to be a segment of the Axis of the world which is a line
imagined to pass from the North to the South Pole through the Center of the
earth; the style being rightly placed shall still with the end point toward the
elevated Pole, that is upward from the Center, if the North Pole be elevated;
or downward from the Center if the South Pole be elevated.

XXIX. Use. The making of all manner of plain Dyals not having Centers.

If the plain represented on the Instrument (as was taught before in the XXV
and XXVI Uses) cut the Pole of the Aequinoctiall, it is an horary Circle,
either one of them which are drawn in the Instrument, or falling between some
two of them: and the Dyall plain it self shall not cross the axis of the
world, but lie parallel to it, without any Angle of elevation. And therefore
such a Dyal can have no Center: But the style, the substile, and all the hour
lines shall be parallel one to another.

Every such Plain represented on the Instrument,

Either, First it is the Meridian of the place, the Horizontall intersection
whereof is the 12 a clock Line drawn from North to South: and the Dyall made
thereon, is a direct East, or West upright Dyal: In which the substile is
distant from the Line, in the Circle of the Dyall plain parallel to the
Horizon, with an Arch equal to the elevation of the Pole, and upward toward
the Pole. And is also the 6 a clock line in your Dyal.

The rest of the hour lines are thus described. Draw through the substile, in
any point, a long Line at right Angles: that line shall be the Aequinoctial
intersection usually called the Contingent line: And taking a convenient
distance for the style to hang parallel over the substile (according to the
greatness of your Dyall plain) measure it upon the substile from the
Aequinoctiall intersection: and upon the end of that measure, describe half a
Circle for the Aequinoctiall it self. Divide each Quadrant thereof from the
substile, into 6 equal parts, or hours. Then applying a Ruler to the Center,
and to every one of those divisions severally, where in every place the Ruler
shall cut the long line of Aequinoctiall intersection, make pricks: and through
those pricks draw the hour lines, parallel to the Substile, or 6 a clock
line: distinguishing so many of them as be needful, with their figures: that
is all the Forenoone hours on the East plain, and all the Afternoon hours
on the West plain. But in these Dyals there is no 12 a clock line, it being
infinitely distant from the Substile. Lastly hang the style directly over the
Substile, and parallel to it, at the distance formerly taken. And thus are your
East, and West Dyals finished.

Or Secondly, it is the sixth hour Circle, the Horizontal intersection whereof
is the line of East, and West: and the Dyal made thereon is direct North
inclining, or South reclining, with an Arch equal to the complement of the
height of the Pole. And the parallel to the Horizon is the Aequinoctial
intersection: and the line perpendicular to it is the 12 a clock line, and
also the Substile.

The rest of the hour Lines, from 7 a clock in the morning, to 5 in the
evening, are thus described. Take a convenient distance for the Style from the
Substile, measuring it upon the Substile from the Aequinoctial intersection:
and on the end of that space describe the Semicircle of the Aequinoctial, to
be divided on both sides of the Substile into 6 hours: through every one of
which out of the Center, a Ruler being applied; at the points of the several
intersections of the Ruler with the Aequinoctial intersection, draw the hour
Lines parallel to the Substile, or 12 a clock Line: distinguishing them with
their figures, namely 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, on the West side: and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on
the East side: but in these Dyals there is no six a clock Line, it being
infinitely distant from the Substile. Lastly hang the Style directly over the
Substile, and parallel to it, at the distance formerly taken.

Or Thirdly, it is North inclining, or South reclining, and also declining: in
which.

As the tangent of the Elevation of the Pole, is to the Radius; So is the Sine
of the compl: of Declination, to the tang: of the compl: of Inclination or
Reclination.

The Plain being set upon the Instrument by the Arches of Declination and
stooping thereof (as has been taught in XXV ^ Use) shall cut the pole of the
Aequinoctiall. Apply therefore a Ruler to the Pole of the plain, and to the
Pole of the Aequinoctial; and the point in which it cutteth the Limb, mark
for the substile: which is to be transferred unto the Circle of the Dyal
plain, by taking the distance between that point, and the next Horizontal
intersection, and setting it on that Circle from the line parallel to the
Horizon, upward if the plain be North: or downe-ward if the plain be South:
and on that side which is contrary to the Declination. The substile being thus
sound, draw a long line perpendicular to it, for the Aequinoctial intersection.
And taking a convenient distance for the style from the substile, measure it
upon the substile from the Aequinoctiall intersection: and on the end of that
space describe the Semicircle of the Aequinoctial. Then look in your
Instrument how many degrees of the Aequinoctial are intercepted between the
Meridian, and the Arch representing your Plain: and reckoning the same number
of degrees upon the Aequinoctial of the Dyal plain, from the substile toward
the side of Declination, there make a mark for the Meridian point thereof: in
which you must begin to divide the Aequinoctial semicircle into hours both
ways: And that being divided, apply a ruler to the center, and to every one of
the divisions: and at the points of the several intersections of the ruler
with the Aequinoctial intersection, draw the hour lines parallel to the
substile. Set 12 at that hour line which was drawn at the intersection
through the Meridian point of the Equinoctial: and 11, 10, 9, 8, etc. on the
West side: and 1, 2, 3, 4, etc, on the East side. Lastly, hang the style
directly over the substile, and parallel to it, at the distance formerly taken.

XXX Use. How by Sines and tangents to calculate the places of the Meridian,
and Substile, and the height of the Style above it: and the distance of the
Meridian of the Aequinoctiall from the Substile; together with the places of
hour lines, both by calculation, and also Geometrically.

I have already taught the making of all manner of plain Dyals most easily by
the Instrument, for the same height of the Pole. But if any man either want an
Instrument, or else desires greater exactness, I will also here show how to
perform the same by calculation, on the other side of the Instrument.

In a plain erect Dyall declining.

As the Radius is to the Sine of doclination; So is the tang. of the compl. of
the Poles height. to the tang. of the distance of the substile from the
Meridian.

In plain Dyalls both declining and also inclining, and reclining. As the
Radius is to the Sine of inclination reclination So is the tang: of
Declination, to the tang. of the compl. of the distance of the Meridian, from
the line parallel to the horizon.

Again As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of Declination; So is the
tang. of the compl. of the Poles height, to the tang. of Base I.

If the Dyall be South reclining, or North inclining, the sum of Base I, and
of the complement of Inclination or reclination shall be Base II. But if the
Plain be South inclining, or North reclining, the difference of Base I, and of
the complement of inclination, or reclination shall be Base II.

Then say thirdly, As the Sine of the compl. of Base I, is to the Sine of the
compl. or excess of Base II; So is the Sine of the height of the Poles to the
Sine of the height of the style above the substile.

Fourthly, As the Sine of the compl. of the height of the style above the
substile, is to the Sine of Declination; So is the Sine of the compl. of the
height of the Pole, to the Sine of the compl. of the distance of the substile
from the line parallel to the horizon.

Again As the Radius is to the Sine of the compl. of Declination; So is the
Sine of the compl. of the Poles height, to the Sine of the height of the style
above the substile.

Thirdly As the Sine of the Poles height is to the Radius; So is the tang. of
Declination, to the tang. of the Distance of the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall
from the substile. And this distance is ever less then 90 degrees.

In a plain East and West Inclining and Reclining Dyall. As the Radius is to
the Sine of the compl. of inclination reclination So is the tang. of the height
of the Pole, to the tang. of the distance of the substile from the Meridian.

Again As the Radius is to the Sine of inclination reclination So is the Sine
of the height of the Pole, to the Sine of the height of the style above the
substile.

Thirdly, As the Sine of the compl. of the Poles height; is to the Radius; So
is the tang. of the compl. of inclination reclination to the tang. of the
distance of the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall from the substile. And this
distance is ever greater then 90 degrees.

Fifthly As the Sine of the compl. of the height of the style above the
substile, is to the Sine of Declination; So is the Sine of the compl. of
inclination reclination to the Sine of the distance of the Meridian of the
Aequinoctiall from the substile.

And note that in South reclining, and North inclining Plains, if Base II be
less then a quadrant, the contrary pole is elevated above the Plain: And if
Base II be equal to a quadrant, the Plain does cut the Pole of the
Aequinoctiall.

Now concerning the placing of the substile upon the Dyall plain (as I have
already in the XXVIII Use showed for the Meridian) We are to know, First that
the substile is to be drawn upward from the line parallel to the horizon, if
the Plain be Northern; or downward from it, if it be Southern. Except in
North reclining, and South inclining Dyalls, in which the Base I exceeds the
complement of inclination, and reclination: for in them it is quite contrary.
And secondly that the substile is to be drawn in the contrary side from the
Declination. But in North inclining, and South reclining Dyalls, in which the
contrary Pole is elevated, the substile must be drawn through the center into
the opposite quadrant of your Dyall circle.

Lastly, the hour lines in all manner of plain Dyalls, are thus to be found.

If the substile and hour be both on the same side of the Meridian: the arch
of the Aequinoctiall between the substile, and the hour line, shall be
equal to the difference of the two distances, namely of the hour line from
noone, and of the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall from the substile. But if the
substile be upon one side of the Meridian, and the hour on the other side: it
shall be equal to the sum thereof. Then say As the Radius is to the Sine of
the height of the style above the substile; So is the tang. of the arch of the
aequinoctiall, between the substile and the hour line, to the tang. of the
arch of the circle of your Dyall plain, between the substile and that lower
line.

Or else you may without calculation Geometrically inscribe the hour lines in
Dyals having centers (for how to do it in Dyals not having centers, I have
already showed in the XIX Use) thus.

Describe in your Dyall plain a line for the style, at the same height or
distance from the substile, that the true style ought to have. Take also in the
substile (as in reason you shall see fit) a point, and through it draw at right
angles a long line, for the contingent, or Aequinoctiall intersection. Again
from the same point let fall a perpendicular unto the style: the length of this
perpendicular is the nearest distance between that point and the style: and it
is also the distance of the center of the Aequinoctiall from that point:
measure it therefore upon the substile, the contrary way from the center of the
Dyall: and having thus the center of the Aequinoctiall, describe thereupon
toward the contingent line one half of the Aequinoctiall circle: which if the
substile be the Meridian, or 12 a clock line of your Dyall, you must begin to
divide into hours at the substile: But if the substile and Meridian of your
Dyall be several lines, apply a ruler to the center of the Aequinoctial, and
to the intersection of the 12 a clock line with the contingent, and there draw
a line: this line shall be the Meridian of the Aequinoctial: at which you must
begin to divide the Aequinoctiall circle into hours, both ways. Then applying
a ruler unto the center of the Aequinoctial and every one of those divisions,
where the ruler in every place shall cut the contingent line, there make a
mark: and lastly, through every one of those marks from the center of the
Dyall, draw the hour lines themselves.

And if in any hour line it shall happen, that the ruler so applied will not
reach to intersecat the contingent line: you may thus help your self. Which
rule also may serve you to find the Meridian of the Aequinoctiall, as often as
the intersection of the Meridian of the Dyall with the contingent, falls
without your paper or plain.

Draw the hour line as far as it will go. And take with your Compasses the
distance of the intersection point of the contingent with the substile, both
from the center of the Dyal, and from the center of the Aequinoctial. And
taking at all adventure a point in the contingent line, on that side in which
the hour line is, measure from that point on the contingent, both those
distances: and at the ends of them both draw two lines parallel to the
substile, crossing the contingent. Then applying a ruler to the point, which
you took at all adventure, and to the intersection of the parallel, which has
the distance of that center, whence the hour line given proceeds, with that
hour line: where the ruler shall cut the other parallel, make a prick: and
measure the distance between that prick and the contingent, upon the former
parallel, on the other side of the contingent. Lastly, out of the proper center
through the end of that measure, draw a line: which shall be that you desire.

An example of this Geometrical way of delineating the hour lines you shall
find in the description of a South upright Dyall declining 35 degr. and
reclining degr. 41 min. 30. by considering whereof these rules will be found
exceeding plainly set down: As also all the other rules and observations here
delivered, to one that is any whit pregnant and ingenious, will need no other
exemplification, then the inspection of the instrument it self, and of these
