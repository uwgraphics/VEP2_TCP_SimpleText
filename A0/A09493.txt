A BRIEF RELATION of the late Martyrdom of five PERSIANS Converted to the
Catholic Faith by the reformed Carmelites, who remain in the Mission of
PERSIA, with the King of Persia, in his City of Haspahan. And of the increase
of the Christian Faith in those parts.

Gathered out of the Letters, which the Fathers laboring in the said Mission,
have written unto their General: which Letters are printed in the Italian and
French, and are now translated into English for the good of the Church.

Teach ye all Nations, Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Math. 28. 19. DOWAY Printed with permission of Superiors. 1623.

IN my former Letters I made relation to your Reverence, not only of the state
of this our Mission into Persia, and the bordering Kingdoms, where by the
goodness of Almighty God, we have laborers who diligently travel in the
Vineyard of our Lord: but also I have further signified unto you, the fruit and
increase which daily proceeds from our labors, sometimes by Preaching,
Teaching and baptizing Mahometans, whose conversion is most hard: Other
sometimes by reducing the poor deceived souls of the Armenians, Nestorians,
Iacobites, and other such like, unto the Faith of Christ, which are here in
great number; and have little of Christianity, more then the Name; amongst whom
we do much good, and gather great plenty of fruit into the storehouse of our
Lord, which is the greatest comfort we enjoy in these Deserts of Infidelity.

This only heretofore, has been a discomfort unto us, that this our Mission
on our behalfes, has gone on too favorably, and has not been accompanied
with tortures, torments, Imprisonments, and effusion of our Blood, for the
Gospel of Christ which we profess, and desire to plant in these parts; as we
read of in other Missions; and are necessary for us to suffer, as well for the
testimony of the Truth, as for the edification of others; and encouraging them
to be constant in the Faith; which hitherto God has not bestowed upon us,
though we often desire it at his hands, for confirmation of his Truth.

True, it is, that heretofore there has not been wanting, nor yet at this
present there is wanting, occasions, and opportunities, to merit, and to offer
something to our Lord: yet generally the King here though a Mohammedan, has
heretofore always showed toward us, so great signs of affection and love;
that for our sakes he has not molested any Christian, under the name and title
of a Christian: But if at any time he has constrained some of the Armenians
to deny their Faith; he has done it under color, that they have otherwise
displeased him, or for that they had not wherewithal to pay him, that which
they ought, or under some other pretext; until now of late within these few
days, it has pleased his Divine Majesty in part, to hear our Prayers, and to
comfort his Children, by giving them a taste of the sweetness, which those
enjoy, who shed their blood, and yield their lives for his love, though it has
not been fully accomplished in us, yet so it is that he has given us a little
taste, to strengthen our hopes, that hereafter it may be fully accomplished in
us; for not many days ago, he has blessed this Mission with the happy Death
of five Martyrs, and watered it with their Blood: so that now we hope that it
will yield a most plentiful harvest, to the great content of all our
Congregation, but especially to your Reverence who has been so great a
favorer of it.

Amongst other Persians which in these last Months we have Baptized here at
Haspahan; there were five (that is to say) Elia, Chassadir, (his Cozen)
Alexander, Joseph, and Hebrani. Elia has served us sometimes in our house, and
was the Husband of that Theresa, of which I made mention in my former Letters,
who was likewise Baptized by our Fathers; and after Baptism God gave her so
great Zeal; that like an Apostolic Woman, she preached and published the
Name of Jesus Christ in all places; and travailing into her Country, which is
a Province of the Ringdome of Sciras, subject to the King of Persia, she
converted diverse, and with the rest the aforesaid Chassadir, and in those
parts enkindled in them such a desire of Christianity, as that the Governor
of that Province sent diverse times, and lastly his own proper Son to our
Fathers in Haspahan, earnestly entreating them to send two Fathers unto them,
to the intent to teach them the Faith of Jesus Christ; which at that time could
not be executed, because the King of Persia was then incensed against the
Portugals, preparing to wage war against them in Ormus, (being an Island of the
King of Spaines in the East Indies, somewhat further distant from the firm
land, then his other Kingdoms are) as accordingly he shortly afterward
performed.

These foresaid five Christians being Baptized at several times, and
instructed for some weeks, in the mysteries of the holy faith, departed to
make their aboade in their own houses. But we perceiving the Kings indignation
to increase against the Francans (Francks in Persia are called the Christians
that follow the custom of the Latins, to distinguish them from the Greeks,
Armenians, and others) thought it more safe, for them to retire themselves to
Ormus* thereby both to secure themselves from the Kings fury, and the better*
also to confirm them in the holy faith: To this effect Father John of St.
Eliseus (who has bin long times Vicar general of the reformed Carmelits in
these Countries) wrote unto our Fathers, who resided there* and to a Captain
of Ormus, that they would entertain them, and provide for them there, until
the Kings indignation was ouer-passed. He sent his Letters by Elia, as by one
who best knew the ways, and the practice of the Country, and in whom he put
the more confidence, for that he had served in our house. Elia travailed
onwards with great alacrity, although he foresaw the great peril, whereunto
he was exposed, for at that time the Country was all in Arms, and Ormus was
besieged by the Persians. But the ardent desire, which this servant of God had
to endure any thing whatsoever for his sake, made him set light by all dangers,
and thence-forth choosing only for his Companion in the journey, his aforesaid
Cousin Cassadir, he went cheerfully forward, until that in his way, he was
discovered by an Englishman, whereof some are resident in Persia, to traffic
with the King for Silk, which they find there, and brought to be accused
before the Chan, that is to say* the Duke that governed the said Kingdom of
Sciras, in the name of the King of Persia, as his Viceroy, who was going to
the siege of Ormus, who presently shut him up in prison, and searching him,
found the Letters, which after he had perused, he caused him to be racked, and
asked him what he was? Elia answered that he was a Francke, whereupon the Chan
or Duke commanded him, that he should speak in the language of a Francke,
but being ignorant of the language, he pawsed a while, and then said, that he
was a Christian Francke, (which is as much as to say, in the Persian tongue, a
Christian Catholic, or one that yields obedience to the Pope) afterward
the Chan asked Cassadir, Cousin to Elia, what he was, and whither he went, and
upon what affairs? and finding him to be a Christian newly Baptized, who went
to accompany his Cousin, and that they had no other business, but to carry the
Letters he found about them, out of the hatred he bore to Christians: the
Chan begun to be enraged like a dog, and endeavored by diverse means, that
is to say, by threatenings, torments, persuasions, and promises, to make these
two new Disciples of Jesus Christ, to deny the holy faith, and to return to
the false observance of Mahomet: But GOD (who never abandoneth those which
travail for him, and put their trust in him) favored them with so great
abundance of his graces, that they set light by the threats, and torments, and
respected not the promises of the Tyrant; but freely confessed that they were
Christians, and that GOD had showed his favor unto them, to draw them out of
the darkness of infidelity, and the false sect and doctrine of Mahomet, to the
end they might know the true and only faith of Jesus Christ, in which they
were both of them resolved to live and dye.

The words of Elia like darts pierced the heart of the Chan* who enraged with
new indignation, commanded them to be carried into the sight of Ormus, (eight
days distant from that place where they were at that time) and in the presence
of the Christians of that City to be put to death, in such manner, as hear
after shall be declared. In these eight days of travail they were most
inhumanely handled and injured, enduring hunger, thirst, and watching, to which
the cruel instruments of the devil, fierce in heart, and savage in behavior,
added another more greater, which was to labor diverse times, to take from them
the precious treasure of the sacred faith* sometimes by threats, other whiles
by promises, now by flatteries, and again by stripes, under pretext to make
them Runnagates and Apostataes. But these true servants of God, tried like fine
gold in the midst of so many persecutions, suffered and endured all these
cruelties, with joy of spirit, and unspeakable constancy, yielding thanks to
our good Lord Jesus Christ, for the grace he bestowed on them, in making them
worthy to suffer, and endure anything for his love, and for the holy faith,
which they had received in Baptism. Being argued in sight of Ormus, these
fierce and cruel ministers flayed an Ass, and sowed the Martyr Elia in the
skin, and afterward nailed him on high to a great piece of wood: he lived in
this most cruel torment some hours, praising and blessing God, and preaching
the faith of Jesus Christ, after the best manner he could. Cassadir was always
present at this spectacle, who in stead of astonishment, and loosing his
courage, for the torments that were inflicted upon his Cousin, was the more
animated, and remained always constant, confessing Jesus Christ, and rejecting
with an holy disdain, all those that counseled him to return unto the Sect
of Mahomet, which was the cause that they tied him to a Stake, and ripped up
his belly. Thus those two holy Martyrs finished their frail life, to the end
to possess and begin another eternal, and happy; insomuch as the ministers of
cruelty, and those other Infidels that were there present, remained confused
and astonished, at the constancy of those two Martyrs. I could not as yet
understand what became of the bodies of these two glorious Martyrs, but I hope
that God will preserve and reserve so great a treasure.

The Chan of Sciras being informed by these two glorious Martyrs Elia, and
Cassadir, what those three other Christians were, which according to the
Fathers Letters, were to be sent to Ormus, and having notice both of their
names, by which they were baptized, as for the others, they had when they were
yet Mahometans, signified the whole proceedings by his Letters to the King of
Persia, and sent him those Letters which the holy Martyr Elia was to carry to
Ormus. The King having received this news (who at that time was three Leagues
from the City) commanded the foresaid three Christians to be apprehended, who
were not as yet departed, and commanded the Daraga (that is to say, the
Governor of the City of Haspaphan) and the Captain of the Camp, to repair
unto our Covent, and shut us up therein: which they punctually performed,
locking, and sealing up the Cells of the Covent, and shutting all of us
together in one Chamber: After this, they asked Father John, whether he
thought he had done well, or that it were fitting, that he should be the cause
of such a matter, considering that the King had always entertained, and
honored him? Whereunto the Father answered, that he came not into Persia for
the honors and favors which the King had bestowed on him; but for the only
hope he had, not only to convert the King, but his whole Kingdom to the faith
of Jesus Christ. With this answer the Governor and the Captain of Justice,
departed, leaving the Monastarie full of Soldiers: God so would that one of
the Fathers was yet fasting (notwithstanding that it was more then two of the
clock afternoon) and thus consumated he the holy Sacrament. That night they
forbad us to perform our accustomed spiritual exercises, believing that we
would set some Charms, and Sorceries a work. Yet did we that which upon such
like occasion, the Prophet. Daniel did. Your Reverence may consider in what
estate we were, the house being full of Watchmen, and Sergeants that were
Infidels, the gates of the Monastarie locked, when as we might not speak to
any of our friends, or know what was done, but were all of us closed up in a
Chamber, preparing our selves to give our lives for Jesus Christ. One only
thing afflicted us, which was, that we could not give succors to the new
Christians* knowing for certain, that they suffered great necessity of all
things, and for that we could not counsel, and animate them, being doubtful
of their perseverance in the faith.

At that time, we betook our selves to our prayers, beseeching our Lord to
give them force, and perseverance, offering up our prayers to the two holy
Martyrs Elia, and Cassadir, to the end they should interceede, and pray for
them. We remained prisoners thus, for three days space, during which time,
each of us prepared himself to dye, and made a general confession after the
best manner we could. The first day we read the life of St. Ignatius the
Martyr, the second of St. Lawrence, and the third that of St. Katherine. I
cannot express unto you the consolation, and inward joy that we felt, nor the
fervor, or sensible apprehension and zeal of the Fathers: every hour was
unto us a thousand, whilst we expected to give up our lives for Jesus Christ's
sake, and no less able am I to express unto you, the desire which we had,
that our deaths might be accompanied with many torments, neither the fervent
acts which we did to that effect. We tasted (dear Father) of the force, and
efficacy of Gods grace* and the fidelity which God uses toward those who
expose themselves to dangers, by the means of holy obedience; in such sort,
that me thought I saw, that which in such like occations God operated in the
Primitive Church.

The second day of our imprisonment, the King sent these Letters to Father John
(by a Secretary, to the Governor of the City) which he had written by the
holy Martyr Elia to Father Baltaser, and the Captain of Ormus, with the
interpretation of the same, but unfaithfully and corruptly translated by the
direction of the Chan of Sciras, commanding him to certify him, whether these
Letters were his, and whether they were well interpreted, and that he should
interpret them himself, and call to his remembrance what honors and favors
he had done him, and whether this was the acknowledgement which he ought him,
and the reward of the bread and salt they had eaten together; intending hereby,
how often times the King had invited our Fathers to eat with him, perticularly
upon the occasions of the arrival of great Ambassadors, and at Feasts, at
which time, the King is accustomed to make great banquets, to which he always
invited Father John, with some other Fathers, honoring them very much upon
such like occasions, placing them always near himself, feasting them at his
own dish, and doing such like things: (This is a phrase amongst the Persians
to say, they inuit them to eat bread and salt, when they inuit to a
banquet.) Father John read the interpretation of his own Letters* which the
King had sent him, and finding them full of lies, and falsehoods; he
interpreted them, and signified to the Messenger, which was sent unto him by
the King, that he acknowledged the graces, and honors which he had always
received at his Majesty's hands, that those were his Letters; and that it was
true, that he had baptized those five. And being demanded why he Baptized them?
the Father answered: why does the King enforce Christians to forsake their
faith, and become Mahometans? as his Majesty endeavors for Mahomet, so will
I do my uttermost for Jesus Christ, in whose place I am here set: and for this
cause, who so ever they be, that desire to become Christians, those will I
freely baptize, being only sent into these Countries, with these my
Companions, to that intent. The Ministers delivered the answer, which the
Father sent to the King, who was highly contented, both with the interpretation
which the Father had made of his own Letters, which he had sent unto Ormus,
(being much different from those which were sent him by the Chan of Sciras,
translated wholly into a contrary sense, and as it may be thought, by some
enemies of our holy faith) as also with his constancy, and for that cause, the
King said the Father had reason.

Full two hundred Mulaz (which are the Doctors of Mahomets law) were present
with the King, when the Fathers answer was brought unto him, who making some
tumult, and noise; and almost mad with anger, were assembled there, to the end
to complain unto his Majesty, for that the law of Mahomet grew out of
request, and for that we had sent more then five thousand baptized Persians
into Christendom, inciting him to remedy the same, and provoking his
displeasure against us. The King being much displeased, turning himself
toward them (after he had heard the Fathers answer) reviled, and taunted
them with bitter speeches, telling them, that the Father had reason; but that
they were villains, and old crafty Foxes, commanding them out of his
presence: saying, for sixteen years space, I have frequented the Fathers
company, yet has he never told me any untruth, neither have I found any ill
beseeming behavior amongst the Fathers, and I hold them for honest men.
Hereupon the Mulaz departed, confused: At this time the King expressed the
affection which he bare to Father John, which truly is very great, whereupon
we suppose, that the severity which at this present he shows, and heretofore
used toward the Christians his Subjects, as to the Armenians and others, evil
entreating them, and permitting sometimes, that their children should be made
slaves, and forcing some of them to deny their faith, is to no other end, but
to give some satisfaction to the Mulaz, and the people; in that he fears
some revolt, having perticularly discovered diverse times conspiracies against
himself, whereby he stood in danger both of his life, and Kingdom, wherein
one of his sons was intended to be placed, which has been the cause that he
has put two of his sons to death, and as it is presumed, has caused the third
in like sort to be slain, to the intent to leave one of his eldest sons
children, to succeed him in the Kingdom, who as yet is a little Infant, and
incapable of the Empire.

True it is also, that the King naturally is both angry and chollericke, both
by reason of the conspiracies which have been also addressed against him, as
for the death which he has inflicted on his own natural children, so that
this passion has gotten so great power over him, that sometimes he seems to
be out of his wits, and at that time acts beastly resolutions. All these
things being thus past betwixt the King, and the Father, the King commanded
those three prisoners to be brought before him, that were imprisoned in the
City of Haspahan, by reason of the intelligence the Chan of Sciras had given
him, together with these six other, who desired to be Christians, and were
ready to receive sacred baptism, being for this cause also committed to
prison. The King himself asked them whether they were Christians or no? to
whom these Catechumen* answered together, with two of the three other
Christians, (that is to say Joseph, and Hebrain) that they were none; Alexander
only answered with great courage, that he was a Christian. The King commanded
him to forsake his faith, and to return to Mahometisme: Whereupon Alexander,
with greater fervor, and freeness of spirit, said, that he would never commit
such a sin, as to separate himself from the true faith of Jesus Christ, for
the false Doctrine of Mahomet, and that he hoped through the mercy of God, to
live and die a Christian. The King* being strangely moved by this free and
confident answer (as one who was unaccustomed to hear replies, and
contradictions to his commandments) sentenced him to be presently stoned to
Death, and afterward burned to Ashes. The ministers suddenly executed the
Kings command, and happy Alexander publicly confessing Jesus Christ, gave
him thanks, for that he thought him worthy to loose his life for his sake. We
cannot as yet, learn the other particularities of this glorious servant of
God, because the Execution was sudden, and without the City: we only know
that the Relics are in the hands of the Christians, and are kept by them
with honor and reverence.

The other eight (that is to say) the two Christians and the six Catechumens,
who had been brought before the King, with the holy Martyr Alexander, were by
his Majesty's commaundment led unto Father John, to know which were the two
that were Baptized, for all of them had denied themselves to be Christians. We
thus locked up as we have signified unto you, the next day following about an
hour within Night, whilst we were occupied in mental Prayer which we use to
make for one hour in the Evening and another in the Morning; behold the Eight
inchayned Prisoners, together with the ministers of Cruelty, came unto us,
commanding the Father to certify them, which of those were the two
Christians. The Father animated and exhorted them, to confess the true and
holy Faith, which he had taught them, and that God had engraued in them by holy
Baptism, and which they, with so much gladness, had at that time testified; and
also showed unto them, that it was not lawful for Christians to deny the Name
of Jesus Christ, at such time as they are constrained to confess the same, and
afterward he told these whom the King had sent, that Joseph and Hebrain were
the two, which he had Baptized (for the Father knew that the King was well
informed of all) one of these two relented a little, because the Father had
discovered him, uttering forth certain words, whereby he discovered his
apprehension of the danger, the other spoke not one word. Here we have an
occasion, wonderfully to admire the means which his Divine Majesty used at
this time, to assist those two souls, and to crown them with the crown of
holy Martyrdom, provoking even the very ministers of Cruelty, who led them to
Martyrdom, to animate them unto Death for the love of Jesus Christ; for one of
them said, be not afraid of Death, because it is our most assured heritage:
Thou art a Christian, dye then in the Faith of Jesus Christ; Another said this
life passes in a moment, you shall go and live with Jesus Christ: The last
said, Jesus Christ is alive, and is not dead as Mahomet is; continue constant,
and you shall ascend to the fourth Heaven of Jesus Christ.

The next day early in the morning, they brought us back the Eight that were
chayned together, and with them a Portugal called Sebastian Duz, taken
Prisoner by the Kings Soldiers in his Wars, and for that cause detained in
Prison in Haspahan; this did God ordain for his greater Glory, and the aid of
these new Christians: Father John, issued out of the Gate, with Bread to
distribute amongst them, and to refresh them a little, but the Catechumens
would take none, yet did Joseph and Hebrain receive the same, and gave thereof
likewise to Sebastian Duz, entertaining Father John with a joyful countenance,
and great contentment, who called all the other Fathers and Religious, for the
common consolation of all, and after he had exhorted the two Christians to
perseverance, and without fear to confess their God and Savior, who gave
himself for our Redemption, and to esteem it to be a great grace and
blessing to be reputed his Martyrs, and to remember themselves of the virtue,
courage, and constancy, of their three companions, Elia, Cassadir, and
Alexander, who like glorious Saints, enjoy and for ever shall enjoy Eternal
glory: whose intercession he promised them, as also our prayers; but above all
the aid and assistance of Jesus Christ in their passion, and that their
torments would seem sweet, and pleasant unto them: After this each one with
tears in our eyes, embraced each other, envying their happiness, and reputing
our selves not worthy of so great a favor, we took our leave of them, and
they departed comforted, joyful, and invested with a new Spirit; but we
remained sad and afflicted, for that we were deprived of the Crown of
Martyrdom, which we so much desired: we settled our selves to prayers, to
assist them the best that we could, considering that it was not permitted to
us, to do otherwise, neither to accompany them as we desired, and as we
endeauored to do. But Sebastian Duz sufficiently supplied our places,
heartning, comforting, and inciting them always to behave themselves like the
true soldiers of Jesus Christ.

They two with the other seven, which were in chains, that is to say,
Sebastian Duz, with the six Catechumens in religion, were led through the
City of Haspahan, and turned three times about the same, and were then
conveyed to the Kings presence, mean while Sebastian Duz with the two new
Christians, confessed always (both passing thorough the City, and in the way,
with a loud voice, and in the Kings presence) the Name of Jesus Christ. The
King seeing this, commanded that Joseph and Hebrain, should be stoned to
Death, and their Bodies to be burned, and that Sebastian Duz, with the six
Catechumens, should be led back to Prison: and to this purpose it was
Proclaimed throughout the City of Haspahan, that those that loved Mahomet
should repair to the Execution place, with Stones to chastise those, who had
denied the Faith of Mahomet. Being arrived at the place where this Execution of
these two happy Christians, was to be performed, The Governor of the City
who is an Apostata, and has abiured Christian Religion, alighted from his
Horse, and taking the Mulaz with him to ass^^t him, enforced himself to
persuade these two Martyrs, to make profession of the Law of Mahomet,
attempting them, with their ordinary, carnal, and temporal reasons, promising
them not only their lives, and the Kings pardon, but also great Rewards,
considering that not only the matter concerned and hazarded their reputation,
but also the credit of their Prophet Mahomet: Joseph answered with great
courage, saying; That although he were the first that denied himself to be a
Christian, at such time as the King questioned him thereupon, yet now in no
sort he would commit such an error, for that the offense he had committed was
too great already, when in the Kings presence he had denied himself to be a
Christian, hoping that our Lord Jesus Christ, who had showed him so much
favor, as to call him to become a Christian, would now give him grace and
force to suffer Death for his love: Whereupon they that were about him, and
particularly the Mulaz took up stones to stone him, which, whilst they
performed, the Saint having his Head already broken and in pieces, cried out
with a loud voice: Blessed be the holy Name of Jesus, his Faith is holy and
true; and that of Mahomets is false, and no man can be saved thereby; But
Brethren God pardon you, and give you his holy light: telling them further,
that he felt no pain. Hebrain, that was the last to dye for Jesus Christ, was
tempted and likewise assaulted anew, to deny the holy Faith, and to profess
and protest that of Mahomet, whereunto he answered; that he would not do it,
and that he was a true Disciple of Jesus Christ, the true God, and true Man,
wishing them, that they should not loose any more time to persuade him to such
lies, and that they should not delay any longer, to bestow that Crown on him,
which his companions enjoyed in Paradise, and that he was disposed to shed his
Blood for him, and for his Love, who with so great excess of love* had given
his Corporal life for them and him, to the end to give them an Eternal life:
And whilst they bound and fastened him to the stake, he said to the Ministers
of his Execution, that he pardoned them, and desired that God would not
demand account of his Blood at their hands. It is impossible to express with
what rage these Ministers of the Devil stoned this holy Martyr, out of the
dispite they had, for that they could not pervert him, whereupon they remained
wholly confused and derided by all men. Having stoned these two Saints, they
burned their Bodies, and set a watch over the relics and ashes of the Saints,
yet notwithstanding the Christians gathered them all up, so that nothing was
left vnpreserued.

The Kings Ministers repented themselves for that they had Executed the
Martyrs, because they did not believe, that so great a constancy could be in
the Saints, considering the torments which they suffered, and the rather,
because they saw so great a murmr amongst the people, who flocked together in
great multitudes, to see the spectacle they had never seen, and they openly
said, that the faith of the Christians was more strong, and better then theirs:
Whilst this Martyrdom was a doing, we that were locked up, and guarded by our
ordinary Watchmen, prayed God that his holy name might be sanctified in these
his Saints. Not long after this the King departed and went to Kanda, where his
Army attended him; but before his departure, he caused the Catechumens in
Christian Religion, to be set at liberty, and ordained, that not only they
should have their free liberty, but that they should be honored, and and left
free as they were before, to do their offices in our Church. Signifying
hereby, that what he had done, he had done against his will. But as we
remained in the Ministers hands, and the King was far distant from us, they
left us one of the guard in the ^^^ent, saying, that the King had so commanded
them, but this was not a guard but a Mamonda (that is to say a guard of guests
or strangers) and for this cause the Christians frequented not our Church, as
they were accustomed. But GOD draws the best from all things, for by this
persecution, we have gotten the love of diverse Persians, and are in good
reputation with them, and those that kept us, testify our poverty in all
places, and that we are good Christians, which we could not have obtained in
our prosperity. The sensible apprehension that all the City shows, gives us
great occasion to praise God, because all of them thought, that we should have
been put to death, by diverse torments. For going once along the City, and
making some little walk, presently after the death of these Martyrs, they all
beheld us, with joy and contentment, and great reverence, blessing GOD.
Although as yet, we are under the aforesaid guard, and in a manner
imprisoned, yet do we say our offices in the Church, and we ring our bells
(which are very good) as we did before, and as you do in Europe, and
notwithstanding our need of money, wherewith we are pressed, yet within these
few days, we have bought a very good Bell, for fear least the other should
be broken, hoping in God that we shall one day see them, in the best
Idolatrous Church in this City (that is to say) in the Synagogue of the
Mahometans. We remain very much comforted, and the rather because we already
see the efficacy of the intercession, which those five Martyrs make for this
Mission, enjoying the fruit of their blood, wherewith it is watered, hoping to
have greater one day, and to see throughout this whole Kingdom, the holy
Cross triumphantly erected, which God grant for his great and infinite mercy
sake.

The Parents of the Martyrs are very well affected toward us, diverse of the
most Learned and Principals of Haspahan, send us salutations, excusing
themselves, that for the present they cannot come to salute us in person,
because as yet those things that are past, are new, and fresh in memory: And
although we are thus closed up, I will not say Imprisoned, yet some have not
failed to come unto us (although with great danger) importuning us to Baptize
them. The Forty three Territories of the Armenian Christians, who are under the
Kings Obedience (as at other times I have certified your Reverence by my
Letters) had playde the Apostataes, in another Persecution, and were for the
most part become Mahometans, (although as I believe it was not in heart) by the
example of these five Martyrs, they have all of them declared themselves to be
Christians, and protest they are ready to dye for CRHISTS sake and his Love.
The King has taken no notice hereof, but has commanded, that every one
should live according to that Faith wherein he was borne, and to the aforesaid
Forty Territories, he has made restitution of their Christian Books, which
the Persians had taken from them, when they abjured.

These are the fruits of the Death, and intercession of these Five glorious
Martyrs. There are some, that for the present labor to put this Information
into an authentical form by a public Notary, with many witnesses, which
were present at this famous Martyrdom, amongst which there shall be the
Ministers of the King: which once obtained, I will send it to your Reverence,
with all the other particularities that may be known, to the end, you may make
use of them at Rome.

I will certify your Reverence no further as touching the workmen in this
Mission, least I should grow too tedious, but this, that they live in great
observance, and with such perfection, as if this house were a Nouiship, and
they Nouices. They humbly require the Prayers of our Congregation, and
especially and particularly those of your Reverence, and your holy Benediction,
in which we have much confidence. Beseeching you to succor this Mission, and
to send laborers, for the Harvest is great, and your Reverence may believe me,
that sometimes my heart bursteth (if I may so speak it) with compassion seeing
them still crying out for the Bread of the sacred Gospel, and that we cannot
assist them all, as we earnestly desire: The zeal of your Reverence permits
me not to speak any further, knowing what desire you have to assist this
Mission, with the hazard of your blood. Our Lord reward you, and preserve us,
as we pray to that effect.

From Haspahan the Eleventh of April. 1622.
