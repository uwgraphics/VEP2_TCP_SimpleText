The most notable History of JOHN Lord MANDOSSE.

Translated from the Spanish by T. de la Peend.

1565.

To the right worshipful sir Thomas Kemp Knight.
Right worshypfull sir,
when thankfulness had presented unto mine eyes the books: whearein the names
of my friends are imprynted. I found you for sundry causes possessyng an high
place thearein. Whearfore, though it fall not to my fortune presently, to
acquit and discharge my duty: yet these, as certain sign of my good will, to
the uttermost of my small power may grately you in the mean time. Which as
they are (ye simple fruits of my small Orcheyard: the travail of my rude Muse)
I to the judgment of the learned and dyscreate Readers. Wishynge to your
worship perfeete felicytye.

From the mydle Temple. Your kydesman: to command. T. Delapeend.

To the Reader.
Unto the Judgment of
the wise and learned, I
Submit my pains (to pleasure the^)
persuaded thorowlye:
That with aduisement they
will speak, and reason right
Shall rule their tongues, whearfore unto
sir Momus more dyspyte
I give these same: that he,
a while may gnawe thereon.
To whet his poisoned ra^ckling teth,
I cast the curre a bone:
Lest that he seek to byte
my name behind my back,
To say that here his verse is lame,
or here good sense does lack.
For I often times have heard
the vile despised sort
Blind ignorantes, of worthy books
to make such rash report:
That when in order good,
they could not read the same,
They doubted not by slau^derous words
the aucthors to defame.
That learned men allow
these same, it shall to me
Suffyse. Of Momes I do not seek^
commended for to be.
Let them that no time spare
to speak all that they may
To me: and I will answer them
right sone, at each assaye.
Their brutishe brains unfit
to judge of melodye,
Their blinded wits, and senses stopped
do unto them deny
The use of reason so:
that monsters right they be,
Despised dregs of men, to them
in shape alone agree.
Or else right (...)
and currysh whelps they wear,
Their judgments I do now despise:
their rage I do not fear.
The Argument.
THe mercy of God is merueylous:
Which when it pleases him to exte^d
On men, no wile so mischeuous,
Can it pervert from perfect end.
As in this worthy hystorye,
It by a Duchess may appear,
Which faslye of adulterye
Accused, is condemned hear
For to be burned in a fire:
As then the custom did require:
But God, which still defends right,
From death has her delivered,
By prowesle of a Spanishe knight:
Whom afterward she married.
The History of John Lord Mandozze.
When Envy black does breed
within the boiling breast,
When rampynge rage of
rancour rules
wheare reason it should rest:
Then will does bear the swaye,
Wheare wit should have the way.
Sith men of like estate,
and matches meat in might,
Within one country dwelling, seld
agree, Sith that despyte
Doothe dwell with famous men.
Sith wealth does work the woe,
And plenty places pride often times:
It is not strange that so.
(Debate did grow between)
The Mandozz^s and eke
Tolledoes famylyes:
Most ancient noble gentlemen,
and cheyfest lines lykewyes
In all the province theare.
By worthy works, their fame
Was blown about. All Europe then
it did resound the same.
O noble region Spain,
for fruits that fertyle soil,
And happy with the golden mines
for which most men do toil,
O Realm more rich when that
these houses did agree.
O happy soyles whearein such men
borne or brought up they be.
Of both these famylyes
right noble Gentlemen
There were, but yet the lusty Lord
John of Mandossa then
Did far excel them all
in every exercise:
Most valiant, most actyue, and
right polityke like wise.
He was beloved much,
of all the commons theare:
Accepted for his courtesye,
with princes every wheare,
As Pallas painted had,
his mind with learned art:
Even so dame Nature then, in him,
right well had wrought her part.
His lymmes were fyn^ly framd,
his joints so strongly knyt,
That as the Simphonye always
does please the ears: so it
The gasyng eyes of men
does still delyght as much.
No paynter for his portrature,
could pycture any such.
The Grekishe paynter might
an hundred graces theare
have seen, which erst in so^dry shapes
he found not any wheare.
And as his shape did show
right semelie to the sight.
So for his force he was well known
to be a valiant knight.
In ancient hystoryes,
his high renowned fame,
Advanced has unto the skies
the glory of his name.
By space of forty years
these famylyes between,
For sundry causes then
dissension great had been.
All stout of either part.
they would in no wise bear
Wrong unrevenged long wherefore
small skirmishes there wear
Between them often times,
Always when they might meat
With weapons drawn y^ one, did use
the other for to great.
But once, with Armies great
they met their might to try:
By dynt ofswerd they would discern
their matters by and by.
And so, the youthly Lord
Mandossa then did bear
The rule, and charge as cheiftain stout
of all his army theare.
Though to Minutyus
he might be matched well
The Captains Oration to Soldiers Added by the Translaetour.
For courage. Yet for counsel did
not Fabius him excel.
When that his foes, he vewes,
in glistring armor dyght.
His soldiers in such sort he does
encorage then to fight.
Behole my friends, (says he)
the time approaches near.
This day, we must by ma^hode great,
withstand our enmyes hear
Our enemies (says he)
how simply they be guyded.
How rage rules them, and reason us,
how well we be provided.
Of armor good, and men,
though not so many as they
Yet such as do not fear, to spend
their blood I dare well say.
Now, now, this time shall try,
if such as we appear,
We do acquyt our selves like men:
to fight with lusty cheer.
Who would not rather choose,
to dye, then live with shame?
As dastardes for to be despisd,
to lose the worthy fame,
Which with their blood before,
our auncestores have won.
Should we faint hearts not follow the^
to do as they begone?
What bondage is so vile?
what yoke so hard to bear
As for to stoop unto the foe
and still to live in fear?
Our ancestors, with lands,
did leave us liberty.
Should we enthral our selves therefore
for fear and doubt to dye?
To bear the blot of blame
For ever in our name.
Who looks to live so long
in bondage for to be?
Can stomakes stout, of manlike men
to seruyle yoke agree?
O happy death, that does
exempt from miserye.
The noble Romayne Captains did
not double for feign to dye.
Are we not able now,
to keep the worthy fame,
that erst by blood was won: shall want
of courage lose the ^aine?
What would our friends say then,
and all the men that shall
Hear of the shame that should by cow
wardyse upon us fall?
No man thereon would p^tye take,
But every one would us forsake.
Our parenies dead, and shut
in happy feyl^os* they will
For lorow sound into our ears,
a dreadful ^owlyng s^yll.
Their sprightes will us pursue,
all men will us despise.
For want of manho^e we shall be
a gasing for their eyes.
The children in the streates,
will point at you, and say.
Lo there, the wretches which of late
by force wear driven away:
From heritages left,
to them so long ago.
By their forefathers old. And they
like ^eastes have lost it so.
No place there shall apeare,
from shame to hide us in.
Wherefore at once let us account
to dye or else to win,
Be s^oute. For if your courage quail
Lo the^, forth with your force does fa^le.
Tho stayne will never out,
it styckes unto the storke,
We must take heed therefore lest that
our ship run on the rock.
The loss of worldly wealth,
which time may soon restore,
Is small* But honor being lost
is gone for evermore.
O men as dear to me
as fostred children are,
Unto their nurce. For who^ my blood
nor life I will not spare,
Your wealths is mine. And I
With you will live and dye.
Upon your manhodes now,
my state I do repose,
And for to win your wealth, I will
not spare my life to lose.
Now are you at a point
to dye or else to live,
Contented well with such a lot
as destnies us shall give.
The Souldyers then aloude,
all with one voice do cry.
Lo yours we are, though pressed we wear
a thousand deaths to die.
Then straight the trompets sownd
the banners be displaid.
And thundering captains voice does cheer
such men as were afraid.
The foming Steades do stamp,
half mad to hear the sound
Of drommes, the blows on harness ring,
and men that fall to ground.
Mandossa courseth them.
with charged staff in hand.
No man could bear his blow so well,
nor yet his force withstand:
But down to ground he goes,
or through his body ^lydes
The spear. And so without a foil
no man his stroke abydes,
Then with his battle are,
he does so rudely greet
Them at the first, that after, him
they had no list to meet.
His men, to mark that he
his life did hazard so.
their weried sprightes refresshed are
and forewarde they do go.
On every side, they lay
about them with such might:
That boiling rage, wtin their breasts
renewes their force to fight.
Then buckling by the ears,
the horsemens sheylds have met,
Unto their tacle hard they stycke.
and foot to foot is set.
So valiantly they fought the feilde,
And every one was loath to yield.
The tops of spears then fly
about. And swerdes in twain
Do clinke, such cou^ter buffes be lent
and paid so well again.
Such noise with horses, which
about the field do flinge,
Their masters being ^laine before
the field it does so ringe,
With dreadful sound, as though,
into the burning flames
Of Aetna mount: flud Euphrates
had thrown his downward strames.
But to the purpose now.
John of Mandozze had.
A sister, sure a lady good,
which for these things was sad.
And then upon her knees
within her chamber fell,
And prayed to God contynuallye
that it might please him well
To reconsile and make
these familyes agree,
That to their furyous attemptes
a better end might be.
In mydst of all the fight,
when slain on every side
A number wear. And doubtful still
the conquest did abide:
She vows. If vyctorie
her brother may obtain.
Lo Rome she will a voyage go
and come a foot again.
So after cruel fight,
(it chanced thus that day.
The Lord Mandossa conquerours,
does bring the spoils away,
Tolledes their force did fail
their blood abroad is spyld,
And driven to take their legs, forth with
they do forsake the field.
The lady Isab^ll,
hereof does understand,
And she her vow declares to,
her brother out of hand.
Which at the first does muse,
how she durst undertake
On foot for his behoof, so long
a voyage for to make.
And loath he is that she,
should then adventure so:
Through lands unknown, so perylous
a journey for to go.
But she vnportunate
her vow for to fulfill:
Does crave so much that he co^sents,
to give her his good will.
Upon this charge that well,
provided thereunto
Of furniture: With ease she should*
by little iourneys go.
She takes her ^eaue of him.
he wills her well to fare,
And as his comfoxe so her health,
he bids (...)
Departed the^ from Spain,
on Pirences anon
She mou^tes. Those (...) behynd,
through France when she (...),
And past the utmost part^
thereof. As she (...)
Beholdes the haughty (...)
that reach unto the sky.
As she possessed (...)
the highest of them all:
Dispisyng then the clouds benethe
and Cities seming small,
At last with dowenward eyes,
Right goodly she espies,
The City Thurin fair,
that noble famous town:
The duke of Sauoy his ancient seat
whose wife had such renown,
For bewtyes lonely grace:
that every wheare her fame
with worthy praise, had blown about
the glory of her name.
For as to Helen, she
was match for goodly grace:
Even so her fame renoumed was
as much in every place.
Dame Nature tried in her
the force of all her art,
I wrought by wo^drous work, of her
appeared every part.
This Duches, sister was
unto the puissant king
Of happy I Will, in Occean wide.
whose sacred soil does bring
In field such valiunt men,
and does with plenty great,
Increase al things, which may for the^
in any wise be meat.
Divided from the world,
a world alone it is:
Which of it self sufficientlye
has all comodyties.
Norward, not far beyond
the noble country France.
And Trojan Brute his land it was
which stories old advance.
The spanish lady now,
to Thurin glad does go,
To try if fame the truth has told.
and then, it chanced so
By fortunes favor fair,
that as she entered had
Into the City, she espies
the Duchess fair, Iclad
With purple fine, whose gloss
does glyster in her eyes.
As do the beams of Titans son
from highest of the skies,
So that she doubts still,
whether she should behold
The lady bright with beauties shine,
or her attire with gould
So gorgeous and brave.
both do likewise delyght:
But yet the beams of beauty fair
shine clearer in her sight.
In Horselitter the Du-
chesse borne with Horses fair,
Unto the feildes it pleases her
to ride to take the air.
The Lady ^sabell,
when she perceived that,
With fixed eyes beholding her
as one that wondered at
Some sight that seemed strange:
she stands still in stay.
The longer that she looks, the more
she likes in her always.
In mind she does commend,
the sh^pe of her alone.
She surely thinks, she never erst
did see so fair a one.
She knows her beauty now,
agreing to her fame.
And what she knows she ca^ not choose
but need must show the same.
The passing beuty, which
in her above all other
She vewes: makes her a match to make
the better for her brother.
Whom much more tear then life
(good Lady) she did love.
And therefore to her company,
(affection so did move*)
In Spanish tongue she speaks
aloud. If God (says she)
Would grant, my brother might unto
this Duchess married be:
Then might I well be bold,
(and truth therein) to say,
They were ye goodliest couple sure,
in Europe at this day.
The Duchess, which right well
did understand the tongue,
Still passing forth, she marketh well
the company alonge,
All theare as they did stand:
fayning as though that then,
She did not understand the speech,
nor knew what she did mean.
But in her mind she thought,
as she did seem to be,
Some noble woman. And therefore
she biddes a Page, go see
Where she will go to lodge:
and show her, how that I
Desire her for to go and see
my Castle by and by.
But as the Duchess does
walk by the rivers side:
where silver streams twixt meadows green,
with silent noise do slide.
She museth still upon
the words which she before
Had herd. And then into her mind
it runs evermore.
So tossed in troubled mind
she homeward hies in have,
To talk with Lady Isabell.
and so she comes at last
With quick returde again
unto her Castle, wheare
She fyndes the Lady Isabell,
which tarried for her theare.
And so due reverence
she does without delay,
Unto the noble Duchess, as
her better every way.
And she right courteously
Likewise does entertain
The stranger well: perceiuinge sone
that she came furthe of Spain.
She of her fortune, and
her name enquyres also.
She asks eke the cause wherefore
this voyage she does go.
When that the Duchess knew
her birth to be so great,
She does excuse her self forthwith,
that she with honor meat
Had not received her,
and puts all the blame,
On ignorance of her estate
and place from whence she came,
Then after much good talk
of other matters so,
The noble Duchess at the last
desires for to and
Whereto the words erst of
her beutye there she spoke.
And wherefore with her brothers shape
she first that match did make,
The shamefast Spaniard says,
(with blusshyng at the same:)
When that I saw your beuty bright
agreinge to your fame,
I was so bold, furthwith
in Spanysh speech to praise
My brother: though he might have be^
commended more always
By mouth of either, for
because that I may seem,
As sister somewhat parciallie
his beutie to esteem.
Yet notwithstanding that
I do not doubt to say,
(As they that know him can report)
in Spain this many a day,
There was not living seen^*
A worthye^ gentleman,
But as to praise your beauties. It
I have offended than*
Pardon I gra^e because
I spoke vnfaynedl^
The same, with but against ye troth
I could not yet deny*
Wherefore the Duchess say^^
lest she should (...) to do
Her diligence to further it
she aunsweres there unto
Madame, though (...)
you thus (...)
I doubt not but by ch^^nge of pla^^
your judgment so it will
Be altered, (...)
I rather thank that you,
In mind your brothers bou^^e have,
so well imprinted now,
That every shape, which is
presented to your eyes*
You measure to the perfect tipe,
and form of him likewise,
Madame, the Spain^^^ said
if I have done amiss,
To make comparyson vnmeate:
yet bear with me for this.
Though it may not become
his sister for to say,
So much, as truth of him might tell
yet sure thus much, ye may
Hear of his enemies,
which ye beyond his grace,
Will say he is the gentlest knight,
that lives in any place.
The Duchess, seeing her
so earnest for to be,
To praise her brother. Therwithall
delyghted much is she,
And so she brynges her in,
and calls for supper sone,
Which being served sumpteously^
when all the cheer was done,
To honor her the more,
her will is so, that she
Shall (...) chamber with her self
that night well lodge^ be.
Where as the pylgram then,
being wearye of her way
Took rest, and soundlye sleped still
but still the Duchess lay,
With wars within he head:
as they that live in love,
Nothing ye Spanyshe lord unknown
might from her mind remove.
She does suppose, her self
this semely shape to see,
And well she lykes the fancye, which
does show him such to be.
She does c^omend his lovely face:
And lyketh well his goodly grace.
In love she wotes not hew,
Such force has Cupide blind,
A stranger she is darken^es does
behold within her mind.
Supposyng semely shapes
sometime so to agree:
That soon she says (unto her self)
even such a one is he:
And fayrer then the same,
if any fayrer be.
But at the last, of him
such one she does suppose:
That such a friend, she could right will
contented be to chose.
In mind, she does compare
him, to the goodlyest knight,
That ever she had seen before,
so fancye feades her sight.
That night she took no rest,
but turninge to and fro,
On every side, unquietly:
the night she spends so.
Each beuty of the knight,
conceived in her heart,
Like poison vile, increases flames
infecting every part.
The day, at last alofte
lyftes up the lamp of light.
And Pheabus fair upon the earth
does cast his beams so bright.
Then Lady Isabell,
provided to depart:
Does of the Duchess take her leave,
which feleth at her heart
Such fervent flames of fire,
such grypyng greifes, that then,
She wissheth, that she never had
the Spanysh Lady seen.
For sith she has begone:
Her work must needs be done.
She can not rule her rage,
her race begone to stay,
Her fury does enforce her furthe
for to keep on her way.
And so she could not rest,
until the Spanyard, she
Had promised at her return,
with her again to be,
Then wishing her good speed,
to God she leaves her so.
And whylest the Lady Isabell,
forth on her way does go:
The Duchess still does seek,
the mean, wherbye she may
Suppress her flames, and quench the fire:
her furye for to stay.
But still the more she stryues,
more fervent is the fire.
And as the greater hope remaynes:
the more is her desire,
Within her tender breast,
such force is of the flame:
That she, good Duchess, could not long
endure to bear the same.
Her heavy heart so sore oppressed
Did spoil her lymes of wonted rest.
So. After sundry swarms,
of thoughts on every side:
Upon the part of love then does
the vyctorye abide,
It is at such a point,
without the better chance*
The Duke her husband (cuckold) may,
Unto the hornepype daun^e.
And thus, at last she does
determyne for to take
Advise her in: and Embly^ then,
her maiden for to make,
Of counsel there unto
whom she (...) fould,
So trustye, that she doubted not
these secreates (...),
To her, when she fyt (...),
She thus begins (...) her mind.
O Emilie, (says she)
it is well known to you:
If you have (...) heed unto,
My fashions ere now,
Even since that first, I did
Front England came my ways,
Unto thafflycted minds, I was
a refuge and a stay,
But destenses, they now
such lot to me (...):
That I of council ^eade as much,
as any one alyne
Since worthy I ha^^ none,
my mind to understand
But yo^ in you alone my first,
and latest help does stand*
This cause it does import
no lesser thing th^n this,
Whearon both life, honor lies
of such a weight it is.
And therefore this may sel^*
That I dare trust you well.
She shows furthwith, that she
was not in quiet sense,
The Spanysh Lady Isabell
departed h^^ from thence.
And so declares, that with
her brothers worthy praise
My heart is won: so that within
my mind, his virtue stays.
And I can take no rest,
My wytes, on him always
Be occupied. Yet one
might muse how it should be.
But I shall never live in rest:
till I that Lord may see.
This said, she does conclude,
that for no wanton will:
But for to vewe such semely shape,
therefore she longs still.
Then Emblin, which did love
even with he^ heart always
The Duchess, Piteing her cause,
with gentle words she prays
Her for to stay^^ w^yle,
and to (...) gryfe:
And she with^^ two days at most
for her will find r^lyfe,
The Duchess glad thereof,
requires her earnestly
To think thereon, and promises
if good effect thereby
Do come: to no unthankful one
She should perceive that pleasure done
And so, when Emblin had
approved many ways,
Therefore, Unto the Duchess, she
does come within two days,
And tells her: that, if
this mean may like her mind,
She neade not further seek, therefore
a fitter shyft to find.
And if that you will do this same:
Your enterprise of force must frame.
If you, furthwith will feign
your self so sick (...) be:
That every one more h^pe of death
then life in you may^ see,
In midst of all the sycknes, yo^
Right solemnlye may make a vow:
That if you may furthwith,
recover health again.
Within a certain time to go^
a voyage into Spain,
Unto saint James his shryne.
and frelye forward so,
With Lady Isabell at her
return: you may well go.
And then you may behold,
as long as you shall please
The knight whith now has been the cause
of this your great unease
But we alone shall have
to much add, I fear,
So fynelye in the brauest sort
to bring about this ^eare
Wherefore if you think good
to join the third heareto,
One man I may command for me
all that he can to do,
And this is master Appian.
Your graces own Phisician.
Herein I may be bold
to tell the truth to you,
He has sought many sundry means
to win my love ere now,
He has been vexed sore,
long time for love of me:
And that in way of honesty,
(as far as I could see)
Of wohm till now, I have
accounted very small
For hitherto he has received
almost no hope at all,
But if with flattryng eyes,
and cheerful looks, I shall
Make much of him, and sumtyme for
to kiss him there with all:
I know his love is such,
he would not stick for me,
To make an hasard of his life,
if such a neade should be.
He is a wytty man.
and trimlye learnd also,
Esteemed much abroad, and may,
do much hear in I kno.
The Duchess, straight as she,
does understand of this
Discourse: the polycye unto
her mind so fytt it is.
That over come with joy,
the maid she did embrace.
And said good we^ch hereby, thou have
high and loftye place
In my good will, and so,
you shall have evermore.
By faith of me a Pryncesse I
do promise you therefore,
If that my purpose, now
take happilye success,
I will no longer use you as
an handmayden doubtless,
But I do rather mean,
a friend of you to make.
Of who^ in doubtful things always
some comfort I may take.
For I assure my self,
as you have showed here in
Your gredie will, so may you still
proceade as you begin,
And as a strong and steadfast stay
I shall accounte of you always.
Now am I satisfied,
by that: which you have said,
So well, that I of any thing
nead not to be afraid,
If fortune on our side
may be. Now go thy way,
To talk with thy Physician,
and I without delay,
Will lay me down to rest,
and feign disease, so well
That none may it perceive, now gone
is Emblyn, for to tell
How that the Duchess is,
diseased in her head:
And lately is laid down to take
sum rest upon her bed,
The Duchess does deuyse
to have a further pain.
Within her stomach sone she learnd,
such sycknes for to feign.
She tourneth often times
about, to seek her ease,
And though she feign it finely: yet
she feleth no disease.
She plunged is in pain
poor soul, for pleasures sake:
She means by grief so much to gain
as shall her sorrows slake.
Such (...) have women. L^e
such shyftes how they can make
When that they list full pretilye
their pleasures for to take,
So sick as she appears,
so hole is dead she is,
She semes so sad, and in so glad,
that none perceaneth this.
No one suspicious part,
for to declare her mind,
In all the time of that desease,
in her they could not find.
Full four days thus she lay,
and seind to take no rest:
Although that with no painful grief
She felt her self oppressed.
Yet lookynge like to die,
the liuelye ^^dye lies,
Nor hope of health in her at all
that any one espies.
Each one bewayles her woe,
and sorrows for her greyse*
Her self alone a refuge knows
in sycknes to releife
Her heart. O color syne,
O crast ye cloked joy.
Her sorrows such, her ease so much
such pleasant sweet an^^^,
Well worth such wirts, (...),
the way for to de^^^^
A remedy for to recure
their careful (...),
Well worth the ready braures
that ever have in store
A shyft at nead, within a Bore
bear saw for every sore*
So simple as sh^e seem,
so subtle as she is:
It is a wonder for to see
them so deceaud in this.
No man (...) could more,
dissemble in such (...),
Her wo^^^s so fytlie (...) therefore,
that sure had the grace
For to be sick, but now
has Embli^ begon^e
To task with master Appian,
and thus at last has done
So much: that she (...) felt
him into lovers tr^^e
And then with long discourse forthwith
she shows the Duchess case^
What furyous (...) she felt,
what panges she did abide:
Till that this remedy, for her
at last she did provide*
And (...) conclude*
she adds this thereto:
That if he keep her counsel close
endeuouryng to do,
His best to aid her, then
she promyseth straight way,
To be his wife, To witness which,
she makes no more delay,
But with her foulded arms
his neck she did ^mbrace,
And kyssed him right louinglye,
But Appian glade of grace,
Can skant such joy sustain,
thearwith more glad was he,
Then if that his H^pocrates,
or Gaelen he should see
From out their restfull graves,
for to have risen then,
To lead their lives, as they had done
among the mydst of men.
He promised, her then
in nothing to deny,
While he should live, and so thearon
up go they by and by,
Unto the Duchess then
their purpose to begin.
And to her chamber so
when they wear entre^ (...),
He may perceive how (...)
does hardlye draw her wind,
And for the suffocation of
her matryce, he does find
Furthwyth, that she would have
a stomoke very weak.
With dobled tongue with in her mouth
full sayntlye she could speak,
He does to them declare,
what danger she is in:
With many protestations
his tale he does begine,
First biddinge every one
to draw them selves aside,
Whylst he by further talk may fell,
how she her self shall guide,
And so f^rth with they go away,
And leave him there his mind to say.
Now that all these afayres
the better he might hyde,
With him an od perfume he brought
the force whereof was tried
To be so strange, that by
the smell thearof, straight way
The Duchess in such fyttes like one
half dead, long time she lay,
Till force thearof were gone,
and then to her again,
The (...), and wonted hue,
it did fourth with remain.
The Duchess, lyked that
so well: that in her mind
She thought all men cold not, for her
a fytter medcine find.
Among them three, then is
the matter handled so:
That through ye town ye comen brute
From mouths of men does go:
The Duchess neades will dye.
the Duke does understand
Heareof, and sent for all the best
Phisicians out of hand
That were in Thurin then:
to this intent that they
Should look to her, which being cu^^
Unto the Duke, straight way
Unto her chamber up,
they all together go
The Duke with them desires to here
how that his wife may do,
Whose color in her face
was altered so much:
That she appeared then as though,
she never had been such.
And they which her before had seen,
O^ght doubt if she the same had been
For why, of Appian
she took perfume before:
That of her health Phisycians,
Despayred ever more.
And so when all they had
consulted what they could
With master Appian they doubt
what way thearin they should
Take. And at last they come
the Duke unto, and say
Twere best, yt for her soul he should
provide the best he may.
The Duke be yond all mesure,
aflycted then with grief:
Sendes for the byshopps suffragane
a man of Godly life,
That he should her exhort
steadfast in faith to be.
And of this father old, furthwith
confessed then is she,
With voice so faint (God knows)
^er words were uttered
As though not of this world she were
she seemed then half dead.
Her piteous ruthful looks,
persuaded every one,
That from her senceles corpse furthewith
(...) be gone.
Yet th^nkes be unto God,
a faithful soul was she:
She hopes, ere it be long, in shrift
with spanishe Lord to be.
The Bishop in few words,
with her had quycklye done:
Her nature faylynge sure he thought
that death was coming on.
The Duchess gyues him thanks:
desiring that he will
Among his daily orisons.
her soul remember still,
Then straight the lustye Lords
and Ladies do cum in:
One does bewail her woeful case.
an other does begin,
To give her counsel that
to dye she may provide,
And lykneth men unto the flower,
that can not long abide.
The Duchess then begyns,
in frantike furyous fitts,
To beat her self, and takes on
as she had lost her wysts.
Amassed thear with all,
as many as are by
Do think, how ye her life will leave
her corpse imediatlye (...)
One wise among the rest,
Alowd to her both cry:
O sovereign think on christ ye which
on cross for us did dye,
Another wills her,
on other saints to call:
The noise is great, but Emilie
which knows her counsels all,
Saint Iame (says she) from youth,
you shorshypped always.
To hear of him the duchess straight
as in a trance she stays,
She rules with vylage wan,
her deadlye downward eyes.
And tremblyng very fynelye, then
with ^^low voice she cries,
O glorious Apostle,
which me dydst help always:
If by thy intercession,
my health this time I may
Recover well, to thee
due honor for to do
Unto the place, whearas thy corpse
is buried will I go.
When feigned prayers she,
had ended in this wise,
To try if she can sleep a while,
she shu^he (...) heavy eyes,
And (...) rest,
she did contynew so:
Then every one therefore forth of
her chamber straight does go,
Exept the Duke alone,
which could not go away:
But for his loving spouse her health,
to God on high does pray.
Two hours then being past,
the Duchess in her bed,
Does stir more lively then before:
and holds up her head,
That one might see she was
well eased of her pain.
With strength she casts furthe her arms.
and plucks them in again.
The Duke her husband then,
with lively cheerful eye:
With heavy hue leninge beside,
her head, she does espy.
And then about his neck,
her heedles arms does cast:
And kyssing him she said, good Lord,
three hours not fully past,
I thought I should have left,
these joys and all with you,
But thanks to God, and eke the saint
to whom I made n^^ (...),
I feel my self, so well
amended for to be,
That if I wax not worse again,
I dare well warrant thee,
You shall not yet awhyle
be married any more.
But when ye Duke did hear the same
he was so glad therefore:
That then he had no power
to speak one word at all,
But marueylynge does her behold
as one that had a fall
Down from on high, and still
lies gasyng on the ground,
Not knowing wheare he is, like one
that falls in a sound,
This past, as soon as of
these news the people knoe,
Rejoicing, that the Duchess fair
was then amended so,
In their procession,
to God great thanks they give,
As was their wo^t. For well they hope
the Duchess now will live.
Each one did wayle her woe,
and of her health to hear,
Each one was glad, within the court
theare ^a^^^ged was the cheer
They (...) to stir,
which erst did sit full sad.
The Duchess was so well beloved
that every one was glad
To hear the news and so,
the Duchess takes such head.
That she recovered before
she felt disease in dead,
Then in her heart began
anoter kind of play.
That same disease she could not help
by any kind of way,
For Lord Mandozze then,
that fytt continewed so:
Untyll the Lady Isabell
homeward returned fro
Her voyage, and forthwith
unto the Duchess came:
For that at her departinge thence,
she promised the same*
So when with other talk,
the Duchess fair, and she
Protested had, how the one was glad
the other for to see.
To tell her then at last,
the Duchess does not stay,
How that sore sick she kept her head
still sense she wen^ (...)
Fro thence. Nor then she (...)
forget, to tell her how,
By grace of God and good Saint James,
to whom she made her vow:
Her health thearby she has
recovered aganye.
If of the Duke her husband then
such leave she may obtain.
She should be hapye sure,
her vayage for to go
In her good company,
the Sapnyshe lady so
Perswardes her for to do,
and further does declare,
The synguler momodyties
which in her contreie are.
How worthy gentle man
and Ladies fair and free,
At her Aryuall theare furthwith
will cum her grace to see:
All ready for to be,
best service that they can,
And so your company says she:
shall be much honor then
To me, in pleasant way
how merye we may be.
For to persuade her willing mind
(...)tteth she,
It ^^deth not to hyd
him go, that runs away,
It neadeth not by force to drive
the horse that would not stay.
Few words may soon persuade
the judge that is content:
Even of his own accord unto,
the case for to consent.
The Lady Isabell,
persuades her to go,
And she had of long time, before
be willing thereunto.
The Duchess then did think
each taryaunce long always,
And therefore to the Duke,
her husband on a day
She says. My Lord I think
ye know the grievous pain,
And martyrdom which I so long
in sycknes did sustain.
The vow also, I trow
you have not yet forgott*
Which for my health recovered,
I gladlye made, God wott,
And therefore me such leave,
I pray you for to give:
That out of hand I ma^e
dispache this voyage (...)
Having occasyon fyff by thy^^
great Lady as ye know.
She would be glad I think,
that we might go to gether.
And it might be both for mine ease
and honor to go with her,
Thearto, the gentle Duke
right gladly did agree,
The treason, lodged long with in
her breast he could not see.
Prouisyon being made
for things, that they may neade,
Like Pilgremes then I clothed, on
their Journey they proceade,
With many Ladies fair,
and lusty gentlemen,
Sir Appian and Emelye
were not forgotten then,
Among the rest, so much
by trauayles great they do:
That past the frosen Alps high
they cummen are into
The cuntreye of Ro^willon,
and entered in to Spain:
The Duchess saying ye place so nigh
whereof she was so said,
She prayese the Lady Isabell
That b^^the way she would not tell
(...) would be. And so,
in little iourneys they
Arryue, wheare as the lusty Lord,
John y^ Mandozze lay.
The Spanyshe Lady prays
the Duchess then, that she
May send to show her brother that
arrived theare they be.
The Duchess is content,
the messenger is gone,
And found the Lord Mandozze sone,
to whom he shows anon.
How that the Duchess is
even now, arrived theare.
And tells ye questions: which between
her, and his sister wear:
And passing beutye of
the Duchess does declare.
Mandozze then right gladly does
him self furthwith prepare,
With forty or fyftie of
his worthyest gentlemen,
Right brauelye so appointed to
receive the Duchess then,
And in his mind he thought,
no Pryncesse was so free
Or careless of her labor, in
that age and time; ^^at ^^ee
A foot would undertake
So great a voyage for to make.
But for sum other cause.
but what thereof he may
Conceive, in mind right well he does
dissemble that always,
So on he rydes, till that
his sister does espy,
Him from a far in fyeldes, and so
she shows by and by
Unto the Duchess how,
he which co^mes riding hear
Upon a Genet white as snow:
that is her brother dear.
The rest his subjects are,
Mand^zze coming nighe,
Thryse or four times at least, he makes
his horse to mount on high,
And leap into the air,
with flynging feet aloft.
Or this side turninge thrice about
on the other side as often,
His foot on ground being set
with comlie grace straight way,
When he had kyste the duchess hand
Madame, then did he say.
I think the wandering knights
that (...) lon^e ago,
And ^^^ght to win immortal fame
by valiant acts also,
If they had found such hap,
admonge auentures great,
That with such worthy Pylgremes is
they might sometime have met:
Their Spear and Harnes they
would soon have laid side
To bear your burdens in the way,
your trauaill to a bide.
And then the Pryncesse, which
was well brought up always,
And lived had in ease, and joy
until that present day,
Lest she for shamfast fear,
should fail again to give
Answer to him (My Lord) she says
if knights which erst did live
Such as you say they should
by greater bliss, have met.
With Pilgrims such as we apeare:
we must neades hope, that ye^.
The blessed saint to whom
I made so solemn vow:
To honor whom I undertake
this tedyous travail now,
Would save us from the^e force
or else we should sustain, (...)
These labors great, in iour^^y long,
at last to lose our pain
And so, this first attaynt
a way to love did make
More wide. The^ Lord Mand^zze sone
her by the arm does take:
And to his castle leads
her furthe, with softlye pace,
Deuysyng talk not tedious
to her in any case
He leads the Duchess fair,
Cupido blind does lead
Them both. As they still on their way
with tender feet does tread,
The one, the other does
behoulde with fyxed eyes:
And both their hearts like love does hold
in friendly hand likewise.
The poison left behind
from love, his leaden dart.
(...) She sow all beuties set
in him before her eyes,
More perfect portrature, she thought
no paynter could deuyse.
Though fancy partlye dye
persuade her thearunto,
She was not much deceaud, for why
the Ita^^an stories do
Ab(...) his worthy shape,
and further show of him,
^ow he did pass the Princes all,
which lived in his time.
But when the Duchess had
by outward gestures toulde
The secrets of her heart* often times:
and comfort never could
Receive, to satesfie
her discontented mind:
And blamyng much within her heart
the knight to be unkind,
Sith for her trauyle, she
no better hyre could find,
When at his castelt she
three days had tarried so:
Therefore she does determyne thence
next morning for to go.
She means to give the flypp
so to deceive the knight.
And when Aurora had removed
the darksum shades of night
When light of dau^^yng day.
Had driven ye goulden stars away.
The Duchess goes unto
the chaumber by and by,
Whearas the Lady Isabell
within her bed did lie.
So taking leave of her,
she thanks her hartelye
Both for her entertainment theare
and all her courtesye,
The Duchess now she is
departed with her train,
Mandozze under stands theareof
within and hour or twain.
He looks then about,
and sorye in his heart,
He museth much whearfore she should
so sudaynlye depart,
And take no leave of him.
so troubled much in mind,
Among a thousand things he thinks
it hard the cause to find,
And thus so long at last
he maruayleth theareat,
That his unthankfulness he knows
te be the cause of that.
Upon him self he sees the blame
And is right sorry for the same*
Since she a Pryncesse great,
did cum so far to see
Him the^ he cold not choose but think
him self unkind to be,
For that to please her then
he was no redyer.
Nor, yet his service frank and free
had never offered her,
Whearfore he takes with him
two of his men straight way.
And after her rydes f^rthe
in all the haste he may,
At last upon a Cauls way, he
Espyes them in their way to be.
A lyghted from his horse
he makes no more delay,
But asks of the Duchess why
she went so sone a way,
If at his castle then
she was dyspleased so.
That of her going thence she would
not suffer him to knoe,
He promises with all
his service true to do:
If it may pleate her so. He will
with her to Thurin go.
He will not her forsake
for all the world beside:
If that she will comaund him so
with her to go or ride.
And passing further be
in syghing sore does say:
O Lady Duchess, fortune had
done much for me that day,
If when my sister made
the vow that she would go
To Rome: I had of enemies
furthwith been conquered thoe.
For then I might have had,
some hope again to be
A conqueror on them likewise,
and sometime to be free.
But now unto my self
subdued: I must remain
A subject evermore, exept
by you I get again
Lost lybertye at last.
in you to save or spyll
My life it lies. I have no force
for to subdue my will.
Unto your grace my self I yield
on me your list full fill,
You are the cause of all my care.
you may recure mine ill.
For now (Ab las,) since you
this country first came in:
I felt such hard assault within
my heart for to begin,
That left me to resyst,
I have no further might.
And vanquished it boteth not
(...), man to fight,
I wo^^ot what to do,
but to complain my grief,
(For to be wail my woes) to you
which may my mind releife,
And ever that which I
so hardlye could sustain:
You would dessemble it, as though
you did not know my pain.
Often times by signs, I did
to you declare my mind,
And you so strange thereto always
my meaning would not find.
Far from my thoughts you semd to be
My woeful sighs you would not see.
And that the lo^er, so
my life might make an end
You left my house also to day,
disdayninge for to spend
So little time, as for
to bid me well to fare.
And that does grieve my heart again,
renewynge all my care,
So, these may you desire
For to return with me:
And show me further courtesye,
or else that you may see.
On me, which you would more
upon your foes require
For cruel death, of this your f^ght
shall pay the woeful hyre,
And mournful syghes, he draws
from depest of his breast:
To tessifye the pa^^io^s
whearwith he was oppressed,
And gentle tears from out
his eyes do fall a pace,
The lyuelye blood with color fresh
did change within his face.
So that he thought his soul
with grief oppressed so sore:
would the^ have left his senceles corpse,
the Duchess now therefore,
Though shamfast blood with in
her blushing cheakes: do stay her tongue
her tale for to begyne:
The blood as red as rose
within her face so clear,
(O beuties force) it did present,
a passing louelye cheer.
With modesty divine,
she ^ules her twyncklyng eyes,
And smokynge sighs full sweet also
she castes up to the skies,
The crystal tears do fall:
From down her face with all.
When reason had at last,
the woeful ^and undone,
Wh^^ stayed her tung with Angels voice
to speak she thus begone.
I do not know the cause,
whearfore you do pretend,
That I should give occasyon,
your youthful days to end*
For if I knew my self
but cause of your anoy:
My lothed life, I could for greyfe
no longer time enjoy.
Such care I ^ould conceive thereby:
That I should much desire to dye,
Assure your self therefore
that I would be your own,
For all the world I would not this
to any hear were known
The^ fainting fear quight fled awa^e
She doubts not furthwith to say.
That flamynge fire of love
(Is kendled in her breast)
And she with how by night, or day,
for him she takes no rest,
If you one hour should fe^e,
such fyttes as I sustain:
You myhht says she, of crueltye
then with a cause complain.
For sure your absence is
a very death to me,
And long (I know) I could not live
without sum hope to see
You sone. Again for this
to you I will confess:
Long time ere now, I have for you
endured in destresse.
It is impossible
almost that I should live:
If fortune unto me furthwith
sum comfort do not give.
But this I must needs say:
(...) when at first, I saw
Your cold affection and desire,
such faynting force to draw
Me to your mind: I thought
the cause thereof should be,
For sum oppinion ill, which you
conceived had of me,
Or that perchance, you thought
(for sure it may be so)
That I should seem to lyberall,
mine honor to forgo.
And that my country soil,
I did therefore forsake
That of my self, a slave I should
to your good graces make.
And ^^^ie for this cause
I took no lea^e if you:
When from your house I came, but yet
perceiving playnlie, now
By this your heavy cheer,
that otherwise I may
Suppose thereof: I do confess
my fault. And you I pray
For to forget it and
at my return, I shall
Sufficient satisfaction pay,
and make amends for all
I will repent in place,
wheare as I have offended.
And prisoner my heart with you
till all this be amended
I leave. And thus the whilst
contented you must be,
And to your castle now return,
no further go with me.
The knyhht thereto obayes,
her mind for to fulfill:
But yet her beauties all within
his heart imprynted still
He bears, a burden hoate,
with love being sore oppressed,
And hope prolonges his life, which he
does lead in great unrest,
Each one the others heart
does hold. And so likewise*
The gestures of the one are still
before the others eyes.
Now him we leave, by hope
his fancyes for to feade,
And to the Duchess now, which on
her voyage does procead,
For fortune lies in watch
and does her nets prepare,
She spoils them of their pleasures sone
and turns their joy to care.
So fortunes whele does run,
and roull on every side,
Still turns fortune to and fro
she never does abide
Long time in sure and steadfast stay^
But shyftes her fycle feet always.
When that with fairest face,
she seems for to smyle,
Then, with Sirenes song so sweet
she seeks to beguyle,
Whearfore all wise men will
in wether fair always
Provide their neadfull things against
a stormy lowryng day
To wise men nothing cum^^s,
unlooked for before
For all mishaps, the manlike mind
is armed evermore.
This Duchess led her life
till now in blessed joy,
And sone, to gether darks^^ clouds
do cum to her anoye.
She is pre^ented now,
Mand^^^^ hopes in vain,
For fortune brekes the band, furt^^^
of all their bliss intwaine,
She lowres on them on whom
erst frendlys she did s^ly^.
Their greedye mind of pleasures sweet
she does furth^^ beguile
Not twelve days after that,
the lyuelye Duchosse, she
From Thu^^in did depart, the Duke
her husbane began to be
Anoyed with absence long
of her, whom he right dear
Did ^^^ld for seruent love, which he
did ever to her ^eale,
And then consydering well,
that she was sister to
A king and how that her he left,
so long away to go:
Per^e^uing this, that it
upon her honor lay*
He makes althinges meal, ^o^^
provided for his way.
And well accompanied
with store of gentlemen,
Without delaie he ^aketh ship,
and into Galye then.
The sails be full with wind,
through surgyng seas ^inaine
They s^oure away, ye ^^^like wa^^es
divided ^o in twain,
The wynd does serve so well
unto his will, that he
Arrived at saint James his town,
before the Duchess she
Was cum. But so at last
he understands among
The Pilgremes theare, ye it belyke,
would not be very long,
Before she came, for they
had left her then behind:
By little iourne is coming forth,
whearfore right glad in mind,
The Duke furthwith does send
sum of his gentlemen,
In have to ride, and met with her,
so for to show her then
The coming of the Duke.
which when the Duchess had Been told by the^, she made as though
thearof she had been glad,
But sure she could have been
contented well: that he
Should not have taken half ye pains
to cum so far to see,
In travail tedious
how well as she had fared
His company a while (God wots)
right well she might have spared.
Thouhh then her fancye led.
her lust for to fullfyll.
Yet does her reason teach her more
to esteem her honor still,
And therefore fynelye, she
does feign always to be
Desirous with great diligence
her husband for to see,
Su^ cheer to bl^she needs must make
Though it be but for fashions sake.
So she to him forth with,
with feigned speed does go,
And lovely looks for him right ^^ne,
she shaped had also,
Then after gre^^ng sweet
she pytieth his pain,
That he in danger great for her
such travail should sustain,
And sorye in her mind,
(she says) she is, therefore,
But for Mandozz^ lustye knight,
it grieved her the more.
And so, in to the church
to gether they be gone:
Whearas her prayers ^nded first,
the Duchess does anon
Remember in her mind
her loves so l^wdlye past
And winnes so much of will that she
repentyng, knows at last
That God was much against
her enterpryses still:
That she the Duke vnfaithfullye
deceived: should fulfill
Her lust. And sorrow so,
does synke within her breast,
That then within her heavy heart
furthwith she does protest,
To fly her fylthy flame
and fufther to forgett,
Manduzze his graces all. And much
she thanketh God, that yet
Her lust beyond the bonds
of honor has not gone,
And clean to quench her lothesome love
she does agree thereon,
That so she will depart
from thence, even out of hand,
Nor of this news now will she let
Mandozze understand,
She instantlye requyres,
her husband home to have.
And so to shyps they go, and sail
so long, till at the last
Mars^ille haven they take:
anoyed of the seas,
And therefore then on horseback they
do ryoe in better case
To Thurin: wheare they lived
to gether long in joy,
And perfect love. But now, the lord
Mandozze in anoye
Does live, for absence of
the Duchess all this while,
His heart abode with her, and he
did live in long ^^^le.
But when he knew, how that
the Duke was commen thither:
And how the Duchess fair, and he
returned home to gether:
His grief he does sustain,
seeing no remedy:
He neades must now make virtue of
extreme necessity,
Determininge to go,
to Thurin her to see,
But now this while, yt all these things
in such a st^te they be,
The Almayanes latelye with
an army huge they are,
Cum in to france, and so do spoil,
the country every wheare.
As soon as of the same,
the king does understand,
He sends to the noble Duke
of Sauoy, out of hand
With army great of france
to encounter with his foes,
But all things in good order set
at home before he goes
He does appoint for his
leiuetenaunt general
The countye P^^calyer, to whom
thaffayres and charge of all
His Duchy he does leave,
that as his self always,
The County, in his absence they
should honor and obaye.
The County well was known
both noble and dyscreate:
And for to take the rule and charge
of common wealth most meat.
The noble men thearto agree:
The people well contented be.
So when he sees him self,
to have the charge alone
The country to dyspose and rule,
commaundyng every one:
Yet markinge well often times
the Duchess beutye brave,
Can not command his lust, the rule,
upon him self to have.
He has no force, to fight
against his new desire,
His flames do burn in broili^g breast,
he fryes in secret fire,
The more he sekes always
for to withstand his ill:
The poison strong so much the more
does rage and rancle still.
That while he stryueth so
the smoke for to suppress:
In greater flames the furyous fire
does more and more increase,
Reason does bid him rule
his rage, and to obaye
In absence of the Duke,
as ought a subject true always,
But fancye does enforce
his follye to fulfill.
So battle in his breast begynnes,
betwext his wit and will,
But reason at the last
is feign to slye the fyeld.
His senses all subdued, is
constrained for to yield
Unto a Fortress vile,
he can resyste no more.
But now with shame does seek the salve
for to recure his sore.
So that he does forget
him self so much, that he
Thearof does make no conscience
to offer service free.
Unto the Duchess: which
had vowed always to live
Upryghtly* And therefore to him
a warning she does give:
That from thencefurthe he be
aduysed better in
His cause, before he do presume
so bouldlye to begin
Unto unlawful love,
A Pryncesse for to move.
She by^s him seek abroad
Wheare as his matches be:
To practice such conclusions
with them of his degree.
She chaufeth much that be
of her so light should deem:
To think that then her honor she
so little should esteem.
And shame to him, she said
that lived all that while:
And yet a dotinge fool, could not
subdue affections vile.
The County Pancalir
when this he does perceive.
Was sum what blanke, so for ye time
of her he takes his leave.
Yet hoping still the best,
the first denienge he
At wome^s mouths does know right well
but words of course to be.
Wherefore with higher style,
he moves his cause again
Another time: when that at large
be pleades his case more plain.
Desyringe her to take
sum pity on his greyfe,
Or else he can not long sustain,
to lead his lothsum life.
He says, his senses fail,
his meat does not digest:
His faynting lymmes have lost their force
his body takes no rest.
For love of her alone
and adds thearunto,
That all his lymbes have now forgot
their duties for to do.
As he does thus a while
his woeful case bewail:
She asks if his wits alwith
his senses do not fail:
A stronger salve she sekes
for his increasynge ill.
Since yt her warning would not serve
but he continews still,
His syeg^; by hard Assault
to make a breach within
Her honor: Of her chastity,
the tort full strong, to win.
County, she says Me think
the warninge which before
I gave: might have persuaded you
to trouble me no more,
These enter pryses rash,
and will you still pursue:
For gettinge how my lord, the duke
has hear advanced you.
Is this the Guerdon meat
which you to him restore?
And did he make you his
Lieuetenant now therefore,
That you upon his bed
the rule also should take?
Is this the right discharge, which you
of that same credyt make.
Is this (I pray.) thallegeance due,
Or service of a subject true?
I promise you, that if
you will not thus forgo
These follyes. I will see that you
'shalbe corrected so,
That subjects from hence furthe
and traitors false, they shall
Thereby example take. And thus
you may be warnd for all.
What confydence (I pray)
might make you now so bold:
That you to me so hardylye
so traytrous mind unfold:
Wax wyser from hence furthe,
to make your match always.
I am your princess whom you ought
to honor and obaye:
The County skooled thus:
that lessen in his brain
Imprinted is so well, that it
will never out agay^e.
Disdaining much of her
to be refused so,
And countinge that the Duke thereof
at his return should know,
His love to deadly spyte
is changed. He always
Inuenteth sundry means to bring
the Duchess to decay.
And as he tosseth so
his mischeife in his mind:
A polecye for him at last,
the Dyuells grace does find.
He had a Nephue then,
not full nyntene years old,
One of the brauest gentlemen,
In Thurin to behold
The Countye having then
no children: he did take
This for his own, and after him
his only heir to make
So on a time to him
my Nephue he does say.
Thou know how that but me thou have
no other help or stay.
And therefore for because,
that God has given to me
No lawful Issue now, mine heir
I have appointed thee,
If thou can have the grace
to follow so my mind:
Especially in things which you
may for your profyt find.
The old vnluftie Duke
is now from home afar,
And many chaunginge chances still
do happen in the war.
If he should chance to dye,
as doubtful is his life,
It Is possible that you might get
the Duchess to your wife.
And so. God knows how great
Advancement it might be
To the. And yt were won with ease
(as it appears to me)
If that hearein* you would
my counsel well obey.
Thought to the point of marriage,
it may not com straight way,
Yet sure, you shall not fail
a friend of her thereby.
To have. By many sundry things
ere this, I did epsy:
She bare thee much good will
and never durst before
Let it besene. Wherefore do thou
stycke stoutlye evermore
Hearto. And take the hap,
whatsoever it do cost:
Do what you can to please her still
it is no labor lost.
Seek all the means ye may,
To serve her every way.
And time shall teach you well
at last, the same to see:
Which youth ^ want of skill till now
has hid always from the.
This simple youth beleues
his on^les wretched wyles.
The craftye Fowlers pype full sone
the selye bird beguyles,
He thinks that all is Gould
that glystreth to the eye.
The Tutcstone of experyence
he wantes the same to try,
He does begin: about
the Duchess, for to be
Always. And shamfastlie by signs,
he mours her so to see:
How he with willing mind
To serve her was enclynde.
Whice when he had observed,
a monthe or twain like wise:
The gentle Duchess at the last
his dylygen^e espyes,
And honesse service which
with earnest zeal, he had
Done her of late. And so therefore
the Duchess, she was glad
To favor him the more,
prefarrynge him above
The other pages. And thereto
his comlye grace does move
The more. Of wantonness
proceaded not her love.
For his good service don to her:
She did him only so prefer,
But now the uncle false
none other thing does he:
But longs of the Duchess still
avenged for to be.
And thinking now for all,
at double or quyte to play:
He calls his Nephue once again,
and in this sort does say,
I see, that now thou art
the hapieste man alive:
If you can take the lucky lot,
as fortune does it give,
Not only great good will,
the Duchess bears to the:
But now with seruent love, to sight
consumed much is she.
But women, (as ye see)
They sumwhat shamfast be.
They love to be desired
in secret place alwaie.
A certain force does please the^ well.
as though constrained they
Do yeald, and grant to that
which they right glad and feign
Would offer: If a little shame
did them not still restrain.
Be barbie then says he,
this to believe thearfore.
For I have proved and found it true,
right often hear to fore,
And that before this time
tomorowe, thou shall say,
Thy self to be the happiest man,
that lives on earth this day.
And thearfore now I would
sumtime, ye should espy,
Unto the Duchess chamber soon,
to go right privily.
Under her bed also,
thy self thear must thou hyde,
Till after mydnight past an hour
at least still to abide.
And when she does begin
in depest sleep to fall:
From underneath the bed,
arise furthwith you shall,
And bravely coming to
her head, you shall declare
That love did cause your coming theare
and tell her who you are.
So be you sure of this
what for her fervent love,
And absence of the Duke so long:
both these likewise will move
Her, then in foulded arms
Most louynglye tembrace
The sone, and cheer thy heart with joys
of lovers sweet solace
The sely youth beleues
his uncles words straight way
Supposinge that the Duchess might
persuade him so to say.
Him self did think no hurt
and therefore doubts no vil,
And so his uncles traytrous mind
furthwyth he does fulfill.
For then the Countye was
obayed as a king,
And honored even as the Duke
him self in every thing.
Before that mydnyght came.
the traitor false in doubt,
Lest that his shamfull vylanye
might be espied out,
Three of the counsel, with
sum of the guard also
He takes, and to the chamber of
the Duchess straight does go.
Wheare knocking at the door,
he wills then to say,
The Duke was cum and so, the door
was opeded wide straight way.
With naked swerd in hand
the Countye rushethe in,
And ragynge like a man out of
his wits he does begin
To pray on every side,
the chamber round about.
And so, from underneath the bed
at last he pluckethe out
His Nephue all amasd,
and tremblinge then for fear:
Like as the lamb which yet alyne
the rauenynge wolf does tear.
To whom denyeng power
one word at last to say:
He thrustes him through y^ throt and the^
with dobled stripe, streghtway
He strykes him in the breast,
that he might quyckely lose
His breath, and be without the power,
his treason to desclose.
And now poor innocent,
upon the ground he lies
His limbs being stiff, his striving life
does yeald to destinyes.
His blade with blood embrewe,
the Countye puts in
His sheath again. And thus does to
the counselors begin.
My friends (says he) this same
was not first time, that I
The wanton and dishonest love
betwens them did espy.
But now at last, I found
a time the truth to try,
But yet this gloton hear, I made
to fair a death to dye.
For his desert requyres,
by rygour of the law:
That horses wyld, in quarters should,
his traytrous body draw.
As for my Lady hear,
the Duchess, at this time
I traue. I can no punishment
determyne for her crime.
You know the customs old
of Sa^oye, do require:
That Ladies of adulterye
conu^cted should in fire
Be burnyd quyeke, if they
Within a year and day,
Find not a Champion, which
in their behalf will fight
The Combat: by his force in feyld
for to defend their right.
But for the allegiance of
my duty, which I owe
Unto my Lord the Duke, I will
by letters let him know
Heareof. And so, the while,
the Duchess shall remain
Within her chaumber close, and have
with her one maid or twain.
The Duchess^ knows her self
now faultles for to be.
And is in mind, amassed much
so great outrage to see.
But well the treason of
The Countye she espyes.
And lokynge on her pages corpse
with piteous weeping eyes,
With sygheng sundry times,
O gyltles soul (says she)
Which hear this lyueles corse have left
now thou do playnlie see.
The wyckednes of him,
Which made the thus to dye.
And having made an end unto
her moan, and mornefull cry
She wringes her arms for woe
and does desire: that they
Would let the corse in semlye grave
be buried ^^rayght way.
For he has not deserved,
to hang on gibet hyes
And to be meat for bestes, or birds,
which in the air do fly,
She says. And so her mind,
the counselors fullfyll,
Misdeaming in their minds yt more
because that she did still.
Excuse the giltles page
of that offense alwaie,
And for to purge her self
nothing at all does say,
The woeful chance full sone
is blown about the cyttie.
And of the gentle Duchess, then
not one but takes pytye,
Crept the County fyerce,
in myschefe hardened so:
That he could never bend, but still
is workinge of her woe,
Fame with these news continually
Full fast, always does further fly
Such murmuring among
the people does arise,
As though the town wear then subdeud
to spoil of ennemies.
And many of them would
with right good will, agree
That on them and their children the^
her punishment should be:
On this condysyon that,
the Duchess might go free.
The County Pancalier
^yd nothing all this day,
But made the accusacyons feign
that all the council may,
Set to their seals furthwyth,
all which in order done,
He sendes two posts in have thearwt,
and into England one*
To show the king her brother,
And to the Duke the other.
Is gone. And both their charge
full soon presented have,
The brother, and the husband both,
they easelye credyte gave
Thearto. And cheyfly they
persuaded are thearby:
Because the Uncle so had made
his Nephew for to dye.
Which should have been his heir,
without some heinous miss.
And so the County his faithfulness
they much commend in this:
That to his blood he dy^
no whyt forgive or spare,
To testefye the faythfulnes
that to his prince he bare.
So fynely for a time,
His craft did cloak the crime.
Though such offense a while
may under ashes lie.
Yet treason will sumtime be known
and time the truth shall try.
What worser foe, then he
which ever does deceive,
Pretending frendshyp, so that one
may hardly him perceive,
This traytrous tyrant hear,
appearinge for to be.
A Judge most just in mischeyfe new
commended much is he,
It is the most pernycyous ill:
In virtues shape deceauyng still.
The kings of England, and
of France, at last agree,
In favor of the Duke: the law
and custom kept shall be
Upon the Duchess just,
to the end all Ladies might
Example take thearby, which ought
to soyne like lamps of light
In virtues fair, to others:
unlawful lusts to leave.
And by his post again, that time,
the County does receive
A rich and costly swerd,
and harneys exellent:
Which him to gratyfye with all,
the king of England sent.
The Duke of Sauoye stays
his post a while, because
The matter touches him so near:
he takes the longer pause.
But at the last, he is
resolved here unto,
He wrytes unto his council that
on pain of life: they do
Right straightly execute
the statutes on his wife,
As her offense required then,
and not to spare her life.
And to the County he
besides, does letters send,
His truth well tried, and service goo^
he highlye does commend.
And ^romyseth to him
due recompense to make.
The post aryued, the letters to
the counsel soon does take.
And so: (the letter red)
they do forthwith agree
According to the custom oulde:
a pyller theare shall be
Of marble stone, set up
within a field theareby,
Wheareon the accusacion, must
be written for mallye:
Which when the Duchess hears,
having no company
But with one Damsel young, and eke
her maiden Emelye:
All comfortless, with grief
on every side oppreste,
As fraticke, rentes her goulde^ hear
and beating on her breast
With mortal syghes, she does
her lucklesse lot bewail:
So that for sorrow so extreme,
her speech a while did fail,
She ceased not of long
her self for to torment,
the tears apace, ran down her face.
her maidens do lament,
Her pyteous careful case,
and ever (as they may)
They do desire her, that she would
take patience always.
And so at last, she lyftes
her joined hande^ on hie:
Desiring God to look upon,
her, in that misery.
With many prayers, she
desires him to sends
Some help her innocencye so
forthwith for to defend.
That she by such releife
her heart reuyued so:
May be released of her grief,
tryumphing of her foe.
Now woeful Emblin, which
the danger great does see,
And knowing then assuredlye
her gyltlesse for to be.
By wonted polycye
for her she did provide,
And saying, Madame neade requires
to lay your tears aside,
And not to spend the time,
with childishe weeping now:
All which can not amend your ill.
me thynkes it best for you
Sum comfort here to take*
and be of better cheer:
The sheyld of pacyence always
against your foe to bear.
And now with speade, sum kind of way
To help your neade, let us assaie.
Now search within your mind,
Draw all your wits hear to.
The shifte which one could not out find
we all may chance to do.
This danger may persuade
you courage for to take.
Now let us see, what shyfte all we
at such a pynch can make.
Assaie, if you can find
the means, furthwith to send^
Good master Appian, in haste
to go, unto your friend
The Lord Mandozze: whose,
so much renowned fame
for force, above all knights of spain.
aruaunced is his name.
And therefore I would wyshe*
you for to write a letter
To him, in loving words, that he,
may like of it the better.
For I know no man sure,
that would adventure now
His life so straungelye: if that he,
do not so much for you,
Consideringe* the prowes of
the County so too known:
ye sou^di^g trump of fame, with praise
his name abroad has blown.
You wotte, how that he is
reported for to be,
Most valyant and courageous knight
in Sauoye* Who ^ut he?
The Duchess then, does bid
her do even as she will.
For I (says she) am comfortless,
and hardened in mine ill.
To live or dye, to me,
the choice does seem al^ne:
Sith every way, my honor thus
for ever more is gone,
How ever it be, no bo^e I see
Both ills do come alyke to me.
Madame, says Emelye
let God therefore provide.
And let us handle this so well,
that we be not espied.
So Ink and paper, she
furthwyth to her does bring,
And says madame, let not your heart
fail you in any thing.
The Duchess draws aside,
perusynge in her spryght
The long dyscourse of all the love,
betweeene her and the knight.
To whom in form, as follows,
her letter she did write.
My Lord Mandozze, The letter of the Duchess, to Lord Mandozze.
I
write not on hope to have
Such remedy by this: that you,
m selye life might save.
Nor fear of dreadful death,
does move me hear unto*
The zeal of my good will to you,
does make me thus to do.
The so^owes sonke* within
my heavy heart, do now
Compel me to declare
my careful case to you
This style so rude perchance
at first, may make you muse
From whence the letters cum, but if
it please you to peruse
The same you shall perceive
how that your loving friend:
(If you vouchsafe pore friends to have)
this greetyng now does send.
The same which you sumtime,
a princess ^lad did see:
A prisoner to shameful death
condemned for to be,
You scantly will believe,
but yet I feel it so.
Though you (perchance) may much distaine
a captyue for to kno.
Since ^^cklesse stars enforce,
and ^oo he does permit
This same to be since Fortune now
consents unto it,
Contented, I must take
good courage unto me,
Knowing the grave, a fortress and
a castle strong to be,
Whearas against such hard
assaults, we saufely may
Take rest, and yet from fortu^es force
defend our selves always,
Whearfore with fyxed eyes,
I do behoulde the grave.
Always the only hope for help,
and comfort that I have,
This only fault, I do
in this my death espy:
That by the treason of my foe,
I am condemde to dye.
And thearfore though theat by
desert I can not crave
Sum grace of you, though I can look
n^ help of you to have:
Yet will I now present
before your eyes, how I
Forsook my country, whear so long
I lived dayntelye
In honor great, and ease,
to put my self unto
So many peryle, as but few
of mine estate would do,
Chaungyng my life which I,
before that time had styll^^
Enjoyed in happy quietness,
with pleasures at my will,
To take on me the attire,
a Pilgrim pyld to be,
By hyls and dales, on foot to go,
the ways unknown to me,
For passing fervent love,
which I did bear to you,
Whom the^ I had not seen, wherefore
me thinks these same, may now
Your conscience assault
so sore: that this may make
Your gentell heart, on my ill suck
sum pity for to take,
For I, not only in
a paynfull prison lie,
But to a cruel Tyrants power,
a subject now am I.
And more then that; each hour,
in danger for to lose
My life, which I full sone to do
with all my heart would chose:
Whearto I had my self,
advanced long ago,
(To have rested in another life.)
save that by doing so,
I should mine honor lose,
and leave unto my name
An heritage of infamye,
for to dyscend with shame.
And therefore sith that love
Does bear with it no price,
Nor can not pay it self, except^
the trybute do arise
From other love: yet pay
the ancient fruits most due
Unto my love: so shall I say,
I found your promise true.
So shall you pay, the hyre
Which frendshyp does require.
And sithe, to Paradyse
that pytie is the gate:
Behold a woeful Pryncesse now,
a wretch most desolate,
Which looks for nothing else
But latest destenie,
For to be burnd as selye lamb
prepared to sacrifyce.
And that I think, you would,
be very loathe to see:
Or else dessembling words, ere this
have much beguyled me:
The rest, this bearer now,
by word of mouth may tell:
Whom as my self you may be bold
for to believe him well.
And so accownt of him
in every case I pray.
And saufelye, unto him commit,
your counsels still you may,
(If it shall please you so)
and thus I make an end,
Desiringe God good life to you,
to me, fair death to lend.
The letter sealed up.
fair Emelie does take
It sone. And wills Appian
all speade thearwith to make.
And to the intent he should
consider that the better:
A dosen kisses sweet also,
she geues him with the letter,
And neade inoughe. For he
poor soul was shronke away^
For thought. she gave hi^ not so much
before then, many a day,
Well cheared up is he,
more gladder much he is,
Then if an hundredth pounds of coin
he had in place of this.
Within his face, again
appears lively blood.
The blessed lyps of Emelye
had done him so great good,
That his purgacions
and pa^trye physike, such:
For his disease, by twenty parts
could not avail as much.
He trotteth now, about
his business by and by.
He pratleth to him self apace,
as pleasant as a Pys.
And sundry notes he tuneth to
the name of Emelye.
He passes not a whyt,
in any place to go:
Since that his mysterysse, he may get
out of a prison so.
He was so glad and feign,
her hest for ot obaye:
That he to travail ceased not,
as well by night, as day,
Till that aryued in Spain,
near to the place (...) he
Did know the Lord Mandozze erst
was wont most times to be.
So theare, he asks his host
both how, and in what place
That Lord was the^* which told him how
he was in very ill case
As any knight mygth be,
^yr why: of late (says he)
His ancient ennemies
Tolledoes, whom before
In every skirmishe, he was wont
to vanquishe evermore:
With such an army, they
are entered on his land:
That Lord Mandozze was to weak^
their force for to withstand.
For once discomfayted,
his soldiers fled away
Unto a little town, which is
beseiged at this day.
And there him self with much hard pain
His enmies might both yet sustain.
Sir Appian then, does take
a guide to lead the way,
which brings him so near ye camp
that well the town he may
Descrye, So back a gain
the guide furthwith be sent:
And sone also him self unto
a captain does present.
Received then he is
a soldier for to be.
Now Appian was wise enoughe,
as soon as he does see,
That they to skyrmishe did begin,
Amongst the thickest he thrusts in.
That he a prisoner
being took, was led away,
Into ^et town* and so,
the souldyers he does pray:
That straight unto their chief,
the Lord Mandozze, he
Might then be led, And so as sone,
as him the Lord does se^
He knows him well enoughe,
since he in Spain before,
Had with the Duchess bens, as of
her counsel ever more.
But understanding of
the means, whearby into
The town he came, he did perceive.
a great good will to do,
His service true: hear in,
his misteresse to obaye,
Which durst his life to hassard so,
as he had done that day.
The Duchess letter then,
sir Appian does deliver:
The Lord goes to his chamber straight
and calls Appian thither.
When he had red it all:
he wills him straight way,
To tell his charge. So Appian, in
this forte begins to say.
The Duchess at this time
thunhapiest Lady alive,
To your good graces evermore,
Her self does wholye geu^.
And humblye you requy^c^,
not for to take it ill,
That she from Galyce did depart,
and could not first fulfill,
Her promise made to you, that she^
At her return your house would see,
Des^a^nge you upon,
the Duke to lay the blame,
Whose vnportunate, that time
did only cause the same
Howbeit her heart (I know)
with you remained still,
Though fortune did not serve so well:
theare wanted no good will.
She was constrained to obaye:
Against her mind to go away.
^o testify, the truth he speaks:
The tears apace fall down his cheakes
And the^,does show ye loves
of county Pancalio:
How that forspite, when he could not
obtain his ^yle desire,
Under her bed did get
his Nephue for to lie,
Whom so, with his own hands, he has
enforced for to dye.
In prosses of his tale,
he does declare at last:
Then prysonment, and hard decree,
against the Duches past,
The Lord Mandoz^^ now
conceyueth very ill
Opinyon of the Duchess, which
he did dyssmble still
Before fyr Appian
To whom, my friend (says be)
If that my fortune did not speak
this time, enough for me,
Inlonge descourse I would
furthwith declare to you,
The woeful myseryes, with which
I am oppressed now.
So that, I am so much
unable for to aid
The Duchess: yt my self each hour
of death may be afraid.
And now (ye see) the force,
and power that I have:
Is all to little hear my men
and gooddes from spoil to save.
As for mine own, I am
so sorye for her woe:
That nothing can I do hear in,
I pray you tell her so.
With comendatyons such,
as heart can best deuyse.
Unluckye fortune to us both,
this lot at once likewise
Has given, that as we did
in joyful minds egree:
So with like cause of care, we now
together captyues be.
So, we with time, be turned thus:
When fortune list to play with us.
And so, a skyrmyshe great,
he makes without delay
Upon his foes: that Appian
might saufelye go his way.
The whylst. He is escaped so.
And home with heavy cheer doth^ go.
But being wise, and did
Mandozz^ his danger see.
Thought his excuse alowable,
on reason good to be.
So when to Thurin he
is come: to Emelye
He ^elleth all* And she unto
the Duchess by and by
Goes in and says, madame
God make you stedfall still
In trouble, for sir Appian
has b^ought you tidinges ill,
And to thunfortunate
Mandozze, and his case
She shows, and how from him at all
th^a^e is no hope of grace,
When that the Duchess heard,
the state that he was in:
O ruthful cheer, that she did bear,
her color did begine
To fail. And she furthwith
unto her self does say.
O most unhappy accursed wretch,
of all that live this day,
For soke on every side,
thou nedest not to doubt.
But now, the light of this thy life
begins to go out.
Now does draw on* sith that
no favor I can find:
whereas I thought my succor sure,
ahlas, ah knight unkind.
Now all to late I loathe
my lust: which into Spain,
Did drive me over hyls and dales,
with labor lost in vain.
Now have I cause for to
repent me of my pain.
But let it pass. Being done, it can
not be to do again.
Now now at last I know,
the love and great good will
Which I did bear to thee: it was
beginning of mine ill.
And God, not Fortune has
provided this for me,
An Hypocrite. For feigned vow
a fyt reward to be,
Then Em^lye in doubt
lest she should use sum rage
Upon her self, does say that she
which is a princess sage
Exhortacion to pa(...) Translat^or
Should not take on, her self
so strangelye to torment,
Consyderinge that afflyctions
from heaven to us are sent,
To prove our pacyence always
if we can be content,
For to confess us worthy of
a greater punishment.
You know, that sum theare be
that never lived in joy:
By their example you may learn
to suffer sum anoye.
For certainly, (we see)
such greyfes, and troubles are
The tokens true, which do the love
of God to us declare,
For whom he suffers
in sins vnponysht still:
The Lord has left, an turned him
lose, unto his own will.
The cross of Christ, we should
right gladly bear therefore.
Our pains wear due to our desert
if they wear ten times more.
Bear this therefore I pray:
referringe all unto
The Lord. Alas, the Duchess says,
how well the healthy, do
Give counsel to the sick,
if you did feel my sore,
Thou woldst with me complain and cry:
on sorrows evermore.
And therefore, leave me now
for to bewail my woe.
My heart oppressed, with burden great
it may be eased so.
Though I right gladly now,
dyssemble this my pain:
Yet clouve smokie of burning sighs
would quicklye me constrayne
To breathe into the air
my smouloring sorrows so,
To ease the painful payse of care,
to void my breast of woe.
That comfort do I see,
in mydst of myserye
Remaininge only unto me:
last ease before I dye.
My heart full freight with fear,
is like to burste in twain.
A ^ump: by the Translat^or
My force does fail, my senses quail,
by pain of pinchinge pain.
O ground gape thou on wide,
my self soul receive,
Sith in dystresse, all comfortless
Now me my frynde does leave,
O gentle death come now,
refose not her to take,
whom every one ahlas: a wretch,
does utterly forsake.
What ^ope of help have I,
When that my friend does me deny.
O Lachisis leave now,
to spyn my fatal thread,
Whea^by my life prolonged is.
tys time the same to shred
From clewe to bygge dispatche
^ doleful ^estenies,
Make have, that this your stint wear done
shut up my woeful eyes.
You mournful damned spryghtes
and Furies systers lad,
Cum sit with me, my mates most meet
in wofell weades iclad.
Singe to my mourning song,
with dread^ull shrekinge cry,
Sith giltlesse I condemened am
a shameful death to dye.
But now the Duchess in
her dumpes, we leave alone,
In sundry raginge fyts as she
contineweth in her moan
Tyll-time may wear her woe
and qualifye her greyfe*
Or god which does the truth well know
shall send her sum releife.
Mandozze now, this while
restes not by night or day:
But thinks on the Duchess and
her woeful case always.
At last him self does see,
that he unworthy wear:
The worship of a knight to have
or noble arms to bear:
If he for fear, to help
the afflycted should deny,
Especyalye such Lady fair
whose force alone does lie
In tears, their wretchedness
always to weep and wayle,
And with him self by this, at last
so much he does prevail.
That he disheryted,
to dye wolude rather chose
In honor, then to live long time
and his good name to lose
For want of courage, so
remembringe with the same
How that in his prosperity
to him the Duchess came.
How can I now (says he)
forsake her in her woe?
Ten deaths to dye, more lefe had I
then once to sail her so.
Thus, sone he order ge^es
for all things neadfull to
Defense of such a town. And does
furthwith to Thurin go,
With horse and harness good:
as any man might neade.
And so aryued at Thurin, he
inquired theare with speade,
If any Spanyardes be
in town. And so he hears
But of one old relygious man,
which theare this twenty years
Had been. An holy man,
and eke beloved well,
Of all the Cytezens. Which then
without the town did dwell
Alone, in cottage low,
that he might so eschew,
The love and lust of worldly things,
his flesh for to subdew.
Such is relygious life,
he lived not in ease,
Like epycures in houses bye
such places as might please
A Prince right well: as they
which sumpteouslye did fare
And live in rest, neade who so list,
they take no kind of care.
The myghtie God does see,
their loathsome lusts at last:
And Baals prestes profane he does
from out his temple cast.
But now the Spanyshe knight
has learned the nearest way,
Unto the old fathers house, to who^
(good man) he first does say.
I am a Spanyard borne,
and cum this country into,
For certain my affairs: wherefore
I pray, thus much to do
On charity as, hear
to let me lodge with you
These three or else four days at most
desyringe nothing now
But lodginge at your hand.
my servant which you see,
All other my necessities.
He may provide for me.
The good old man at first,
did gladlye grant him this:
And masynge at his semelie shape:
when that his servant is
Gone furthe into the town to bye
Such things as should their neade suply
He asks him his name,
and of what shire in spain
He is. All which the gentle knight
to him confesses plain,
The good old man with tears,
that fast fall from his face
Does sat. O God I give the thanks
which have given me the grace,
In this mine old age, now
to see before I die.
Within my house so great a Lord,
whose servant poor am I.
And so this father oulde.
in long dyscourse does tell
Of many matters past. And how
be knew his grandsyre well.
And further him be does
desire, as bou^o^^ theare.
For to co^m^and his ^ous^, as though
within his own he wear.
So then M^^dozze tells
how that he came from Spain.
Entendinge into France to go,
a while theare to remain,
And how that passinge furthe
by, Li^^us, he did hear,
Thill fortune of the Duchess, whom
if that he w^st she wear
Ungiltie of the crime,
he says, he would defend
Her right. Or thearin every drop
of his heart blood to spend.
But in no wise he would
adventure any time
His life, and soul, for to defend
an other bodies crime,
All which the good old man,
then lyked very well:
And says, my lord I think it sure,
no one alive can tell
The truth hearem, except
the Duchess poor, and he
Which has accused her. But sure,
as far as we could see,
She has been evermore
a Princess good and just.
But for the County Pancalyer,
which by our ^oustom must
Approve the same by fight:
(believe me if you lust)
But sure methinkes you are
to young his force to abide,
His manlike might and courage stout
has often times ben tried.
Of all men hear, he is
esteemed for to be
Most hardye and redoubted knight,
that is in Lomberdye.
But yet the victory,
in God his hands does rest.
And that he will dispose always
as it shall please him best.
Even as by David it
appears very plain:
Which then a boy Goliath great,
the Giant fearce has slain.
The knight does answer him,
a way I have found out,
To satisfye my conscience,
and to dissolve my doubt.
But I hear to, small good can do,
whearfore I must hear in
Be bold to crave, some aid to have
of you ear I begin.
Under the color to
confess the Duchess: I
The truth may know, and so if you
think good, imediatly:
I will be polde, and have
my beard clean cut a way,
And get me garments like to yours
for so me thinks we may
Be suffered sone unto
The Duchess for to go.
I think we should have license,
(since that the time draws near)
To exorte her still with patience,
her troubles for to bear,
The good old father glad,
to him does then agree
As well for zeal, as reverence
to his nobylitie.
And so provision made
for all things fit thearto:
Like freirs, to the castle of
the Duchess straight they go.
He that the noble knight
attyred so should see:
Would skantlie then have taken him
so great a Lord to be.
What with the iestures s^tt,
which he so well could feign,
And greyfe for wars at home, al with
the Duchess woes again,
Made him to look more like
a Pylgrim porely fed.
Which like S. John in wyldernes
his life alone had lead,
Then any lusty Lord.
when to the Castle they
Wear cum the good old man unto
the porter sone does say.
My masters seeing that
the time does draw so nigh
Whea^in the Duchess as I hear
^ndemned is to dye.
We are come now thearfore,
to exhort her patiently
To take her death, that she may gain
eternal life thearby.
They to her chamber are,
admytted to go in.
And then Mandozze: fri^r fair,
to her does thus begin.
The peace of God with you,
the Duchess then does say.
Good father, why speak you of peace
and I in strife alwaie
Abide, bereft of ^oye,
gyltlesse condemnde to dye,
A shamfull cruel death also
to heap my myserye.
Mandozze then, which had
his youth in learning spent.
Madame says he, you know right well.
afflictions all be sent
From God* Not come by chance,
no byrd is caught in net.
But by the providence of God,
which does not it forget.
The Prophet Amo^ says,
theare never chance the ill
Within the city: but the same
^he lord does send it still.
And that by holy Job.
appears very plain:
On whom the deuell had no power
till he did leave obtain.
Of God* You must besure,
that tribulacions are
The tokens true which plainly do
the lected flock declare.
It shows a certain sign
that G^d regards us.
Read all the holy scriptures through,
and you shall find it thus,
To drink in cup of his
passion, he does prepare
For them whom he does love, as such
as his ^^e^cted are.
Since that by Caim first
Abell a^licted was:
And Isaake by Ismaell,
his brother in like case.
And Joseph just, whom his
own brothers once did sell,
Look on the Lords elected flock
children of Israel,
Whom under the Aegiptyan king
The Lord did unto bondage bring.
And led them thence again,
Through Seas in midst divided
To happy land at last. Which for
his people he provided.
Consider this also
the which saint Paul does say.
That if we had not hope in Christ,
but for this life always:
We might account our selves
most wretched wightes to be.
The very beasts that fead on grass
wear nothing worse then we,
Our grief is small, to that
which Christ for us did bear.
The mighty god which of the worlds
did make the goodlye sphere,
And all thearin, to whom.
both heaven and earth ^bayes,
Which fixed stars in skies has set
and axe of heavens stays:
Did suffer to be called,
son of a Carpenter:
A devilish man, a glotton, and
of sinners favorer.
And falce seductour. Then
consider hear unto
That we might better clothed be
how barely he did go.
A prisoner also,
he was content to be:
That we from hell, and Satan's bands
for ever might be free,
Him self a sacryfyce,
on alter of the cross
Was offered also, for to
repair old Adams loss.
Remember then that from
his grief, proceades our joy,
And from his pains, our perfect bli^^^,
the ease of our anoye.
The cause why he sustained greyfe:
Was certaynely for our releyfe.
Then we should be ashamed
so dayntye for to be:
A crown of thorns to bear a while
wherefore madame, (says he)
Even in the name of God,
take comfort now I pray.
Despise this death, and arm your self
with patience always.
For God has force full soon
the fury of your foe
To tame, for to suppress his rage.
does not the Lord also
Regard thaflicted flock:
respect the people poor?
He which does raise the fallen folk,
can you again restore
To greater joy, and ease
then that, you had before
The waylinge wretches woe
he sees, with piteing eye.
And hears the mournful moan of them
that live in myserye.
He is the happy Haven.
for hearts that be oppressed:
The comfort to the comfortless,
the wearye bodies rest.
To them in darkness* he
does give the lovely light.
Repose your hope in him. Make him
your Champyon for to fight.
The persecuted poor,
(Saint Matthew says:) they be
The blessed ones, which shall of heaven
the happy kingdom see.
And with his godly talk
when that the knight had done:
The Duchess was so ravished
in contemplacion,
That then her soul, should seem
to taste immediatlye
Of joys divine, and would furthwyth
from out her body fly.
She feels her self even then
to be aledged so,
As one in danger great of late
escaped had thearfro.
And then she does confess
her mind and nothing leave
Behind, which she remembered then
her conscience to greaue.
But then at last unto
her accusation she
Does say. I will not ask my God,
absolved for to be,
For any crime in deed,
or thought: against the right
Of marriage, excepted this
that to a spanishe knight,
Once heretofore, (I wot)
I was affected so:
That fayning for devotion,
to see him I did go.
Without that ever he
had any thing of me:
Save that good will alone, whearin
to him I did agree.
Whearfore my God displeasd,
has suffered now, I see,
These accusations false on me
so lewdlye laid to be:
But seeing that it is his will.
I houlde my self contented still.
When in this sort, all her
confession was done:
A Diamond rich from finger fair,
she draws of anon,
And says, fair father I
a Pryncesse rich have been
But all my goods, and Iuels now
from me are taken clean,
Save this fame ring, the which
the king my brother gave
Me, at my marriage day:
and for because I have
No other means to do
you good: I give you this.
And keep it well, you know not what
the valewe of it is.
Perchance it may releyfe
your Covent at a neade.
The King received is. And home
the Friars t^udge with speade.
When they wear paste the place
Mandozze by and by
With earnest gesture, then does say,
good father I espy:
This woman pore, is now hearein
accused wrongfully.
The Cou^ty (Traitor vile) with shame
deserved has to die.
And therefore now, I am
determined to fight,
Until last breath of all my life,
for to defend her right.
I feel my self at heart,
to be attaynted so,
That long me thinks the time, till to
the purpose I may go.
Wherefore, if I do fail
by fortune ill I pray,
After that I am slain, let me
be known abroad straight way
And let the Duchess bear
this heavy news of me:
But if I skape alive (which is
impossible to be,)
But by the Cou^tie his death
then keape all my affairs
In cecret still And so that night
being spend in godly prayers,
When day so clear had ma^e
the darksome clouds to fly:
And Horse fu^lled with Amrosse
drew Phoebus in the sky:
He makes him self to be
in Armor surely ^yght,
And to the town on Courser strong
forth rydes the valyant knight.
And knockyng at the gate
with thuneryng voice does say
Unto a Porter my good freinde
I pray thee go thy way,
To County Pancalyer,
and bid him to prepare,
Him self, for to maintain the same
which he does hear declare
Against the Duchess just:
and that heart is a knight
Which will compel him to deny
the same, ear it be night.
And that I will cut of
that vile and traiterous tongue:
which durst pronounce ye words to do
so noble a Princess wrong.
Let him come out, him self
the better to acquit:
For of the traitor chuffe I think,
it long to have a sight.
I hope with heave and how
to be upon ^is Jack.
That he shall think, he bears
the devil upon his back.
These news are blown about
the City by and by:
And all the paryshe churches full
of folks, one might espy,
Which for their Lady, now
to God on high do pray.
So whilst this embassage was done,
Mandozze rydes his way,
On lusty fomynge stead
unto the Pillar wheare,
The accusation written was,
and so, abides theare
To see Thaccuser come.
but when the County this does kno
Remorse of conscience
does pynche and prycke him so:
That in his mind he did
endure such preuie pain,
That then repentyng him he would
have been right glad and feign,
The deed had been undone.
and dayntie for to fight.
He seeks still delays, and first
unto the Spanishe knight,
He sendes a messenger.
of him, to ask his name.
To whom Mandozz^ ^toutly says,
he shall not know the same.
But sure for all the rest,
what power in him does lie,
He shall it know and fecle forthwith,
if then he list to try.
The Judges theare also,
affyrmed in the same:
How that their statutes do not bind
him for to show his name.
And further in the case,
the Lawyers all do say:
How that thaccused party ought
to see the fight always.
And reason yield, not for
because their books so be:
But in Fauorem vitae was
the cause of that decree.
Which when the County hears
although he did dystrust
His part: yet of necessity
make manhood now he must.
And being used to
such skirmishes before.
He arms him self forthwith
and fears less therefore
And setting up his brystels then,
like as the forest Bore:
Unto thappoynted place
he comes, and theare does see
His foe in Armoure black
well harnessed to be,
In sign of combat then.
he semes alustie knight.
And brauelye prauncyng up and down
he fears not to fight.
So then the Duchess fair
was sent for out of hand:
Which is not sorye sure inoughe
these news to understand.
Yet in her joyful mind,
always much museth she,
From whence thunhoped help does cum,
or who that knight should be,
That then had promised
to do so much for her.
So she is carried to the feyld
within an horselytter,
Being covered with tylt
of Black. Accompanied
With number great of Ladies sayre
and damsells by her side,
Attired all in black.
they bring her to the place
Whear as the people, and the knights
did tarry for her grace.
Thus then she mounted is
upon a little stage:
Sreight way the Judges which the fell*
appointed wear to gage,
Demand of her since that
she is accused by
The County Pancalyer, as gyltie
of adultery,
And since the custom is,
that you a champion may
Provide, by fight, to prove your right
Within a year and day,
How say you now thearfore,
Madame, do you agree
By this same knight your innocence
approved now may be?
Will you that on his force
alone your right shall lie?
If you by him will wage your law,
your fautlesse truth to try,
Speak now what you think best,
And theare on shall the issue rest.
The Duchess answers,
I do repose my right
In God which knows the same, and in
the manhood of the knight.
To him my cause commit do I:
Indifferent to live or dye.
But tossed in troubled mind,
she thinks sure that he
A stranger never known to her:
sum captain stout should be.
So on her knees she falls,
and lyftyng up her eyes:
O Lord that art on high (says she) The Prayer of the duchess by the
translatour.

in throne above the skies,
Thou know the truth untried.
O Lord maintain my part.
Plead thou my cause, for you do see
the secrets of my heart.
No cloked craft so close*
that any man can hyde
But unto thee discovered,
the same is well espied.
Let not this tyrant fearce
which thriffes my blood to spill,
Triumph on my simplicity.
confound him in his will.
O Lord which thy poor flock,
from Wolves defendest still:
Let not this blooddy butcher now
thy selie Lamb hear kill.
O Lord look down at last,
turn not away thy face
From sinners poor, Bestow on me
the tresure of thy grace.
Thou see my innocence
thou know the pain and smart
That I endured hope, to thee,
I do commit my part.
As Hester thou did help
when she did make her moan:
So Lord help me for why my hope
remaynes in thee alone
As Susan fair, thou did
deliver in her woe.
And Judith from the mighty hand
of Holoferne also:
From this same Centaure fearce,
save me (O Lord) I pray:
Which of mine honor so did seek,
to bear the spoil away.
And then with fixed eyes,
she still behouldes the ground
With look amassed staryng like
as she wear in a sound.
Mandozze now, no more
the County can abide:
But raigyng then with countnance fearce,
to him forthwt does ride.
And says, Thou Traitor, I
do now most playnlie see,
Thy accusacion against
this Pryncesse, falce to be.
Invented for dispite,
most wicked man alive.
And as I say the truth of it,
so God grant me to thryue.
And that thou her belyest
I will the same maintain.
Even in thy heart, right falslye thou
this vylanie did feign.
And wretched Parrycyde,
thou have deserved to dye:
For murdrynge of thy Nepheu pore,
whose gyltles blood does cry,
For vengeance just, before
the face of God: to pay
The due deserved hyre furthwith,
and this which I do say:
By force in fight, I will
approve it by and bye.
Thy wicked breath infectes the air,
thy life offendes the sky.
The light does loath thy look.
it is time for thee to dye.
But now by dint of swerd with thee,
the truth hear will I try,
He had no sooner said
but straight with courage stowte:
The County fearce, as Forest bore,
these words he blustred out
Defamed villayne thou.
which now have hid thy name:
Lest yt thy filthy faults they might
be vttred with the same.
Dare thou to warrant her
which thus has forfaited
By whordome vile for to defile
the Duke her husbands bed^
Afraid for vilanye
though known ye would not be:
Yet may thy shameless words,
declare so much of thee,
That thou sum Ruffian,
one of her mates might seem
A vakabound dispysed knave,
whom no man does esteem,
And therefore, with dispite
to thee. I will maintain
That thou do sas^ie speak of me:
and so I do again
Dofte thee, as a slave
whose due deserts require
No better: but with her to be*
