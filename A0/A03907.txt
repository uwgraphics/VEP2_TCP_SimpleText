^O THE WOORSHIPFVLL Master ROGER PVLESTON Esquire, grace and peace in Christ.
ALthough there be in Sion numbers of such as have and do cast off their riches
into the Lords ^^easurie: such as are every way ^^reful and able to disburse
their two ^ence committed to the^ for the cu^^ng of the wounded man in Ierico:
those labors or rather alms are ^orious on earth and written in heaven:
though I know my self to be one of them, not worth any riches, at only a
mite, rather wishing to ^ue, then having to bestow the two ^nce of God, yet
have I bin (as be^^re, so now again) by entreaty won bestow this short sermon,
though it be but a mite: though nothing to that, which others cast into the
treasury. Whereof therefore as of all desire favorable acceptance, so o^ your
worship I am to crave it, to who^ I have bin bold, and yet of dut^ bound to
offer the same, as a true though a small toke^ of my dutiful and thankful
remembrance of your sundry benefits toward me from tim^ to time, which the
lord god requit^ where I cannot: who double and mu^tiplie his blessings upon
you and kee^ you in all your ways, and us from those enemies that study
nothin^ but how to disquiet us. AMEN

Your Worships in Ch^^^^ to command, E. H.

It is written in the 5. Chapter of Saint Paul's Epistle to the Galathians, and
12. verse.
I would to God they were cut off that do disquiet ^ou.
AS SAINT PAVL (RIGHT Worshipful and dearly beloved in our dear savior) was
chosen of God, to be his lamp, and a light of his golden Candelsticke; so did
he perform the ^utie of light: he bent himself to lighten them that were in
darcknesse, wheresoever he came. He was a lamp to the Thessalonians, a lamp ^o
the Corinthians, a lamp to the Romans, a ^amp to the Ephesians, a lamp to the
Colossi^ns: to omit the rest, he was a lamp to these people of Galatia, as
appears by this Epistle which he penned first (as many take it) and first
^ent unto the^. Wherein appears that he had laid the skilful builder, and
laid them on christ ^e corner stone of the temple: called and converted them
from foolishness to wisdom; from ig^orance to knowledge; from error to the
truth; ^om superstition to christian religion. How^eit where by his painful
care, and careful tra^el among them, he had thus brought the^ to an ^^ppy
estate in Jesus Christ, it grieved Sa^n to see it, and therefore he busied
himself to put out the clear light of Paul the lamp of Christ our savior,
and to pull out of the wall the lively stones that Saint Paul his elect builder
had laid upon him. Nay alas, he did not only grieve at this prosperous estate
of these Galathians, wherein they stood; and therefore sent out such as should
seek to overthrow the good that Paul had wrought among them: but as he
attempted, so he tempted; and by his tempting prevailed so far, that the
Galathians fell from light to darcknes; from true wisdom to their former
folly; from truth to error; from the syncerity of religion to superstition;
from christ to Moses: by which means it came to pass that S. Paul their
Apostle was in a manner forgotten, and his truth almost forsaken of them, and
among them. Which their miserable estate ^ piteous the Apostle considering, he
took thi^ course to write this epistle to them; thereby to warn them of their
estate by him in the gospel; of their folly in reuolting; of his care to
convert them again from concision to the true circumcision: from the ceremonies
of the La^^ to the truth of the gospel, that so Jesus Christ might profit them,
and he be a joyful Apostl^ over, and in them. Many ways does he move the I
need not to express the specials. In the verse he lays before him the
mischief, and great evil that the false Apostles wrought in the church, how
they were enemies to the estate of these Galathians: how they brought them from
the bread of life to feed on leaven: from the green tree, to the dry stick;
from the body to the shadow: from the kernel to the shell: from Christ to the
Law ceremonial: whereby they made the^ sore where they were healed: slaves
where they were freed: lost where they were before quitte by the gospel of
grace, and made Christ unprofitable unto them: where they fought well before,
yet now to flee; where they ^anne well before, yet now to stand: where they were
in the spirit, yet now to end in the flesh: where they had, yet now to loose
the faith of Christ our savior. Which their miserable co^^ition the Apostle
pondering with himself, how ^ttended to their destruction, and to the disglory
of God: (whose gospel was despised that way for untruth, and the blood of
Christ was like ^o be of no profit unto them) it did so grieve ^im on the one
side to see their p^teous estate, and ^eale on the other side did so eat him
up, to see ^he glorious gospel of peace so trod in the dust, that he burst out
in these words which I have ^ead unto you, Would to god they were cut off that
so disquiet you, as if he should have said: O Galathians, I begot you in the
faith, and should be your father: I brought you to the light, an^ should be
your star: I have taught you the truth, and should be your master: and
whereas the Church is an espoused virgin to one husband, ^. Cor. 11.2.
and that one husband is Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, the God of all glory,
I am the Bridegromes friend, (and so you ought to repute me) that have brought
you to the spouse, your mother the Church, in the Kings privy chamber. Cant.
1.3.
I have brought you as Salomo^ speaks, Cant. 1.11.
to see the King at his repast, and your spikenard has given the smell
thereof. O Galathians, what shall I say? I had an office: I prepared my self to
perform it: yea I laid before you a vessel full of the precious blood of
Christ to the purging of you from your sins: nay I have taken the pains to wash
you therein, as whit^ as ever was the snow in Salmon: in a word, I have
described Christ before you, and preached him only a free and full Jesus unto
you: yet and it was my joy to see the happy fruits of these my labors among
you: that you were become the Lambs of Christ, ^oh. 10. Cant. 2.1. ^phe. 5.23.
and Christ your shepherd: the leaves of Christ, and christ the Lilly: the
members of the body of Christ, and Christ your head: the inheritance of
Christ and Christ your Lord, and gracious Savior But yet alas my dear
Galathians what shall say? Where you were my sons, Gal. 4.19.
now ye ^e bastardes: where you were light, now ye ^e dark: where you were in
the truth, now ye ^e straie: Gal. 5.8.
where you were with the spouse in ^e kings privy chamber, now ye are out:
your ^ikenard now does give no smell thereof. O my ^alathians therefore what
shall I say? The ^oxe has played the crafty part among you: ^e false Apostles
have deceived and bewitched ^u: they have broken the quiet league that ^u had
with God in Christ his only Son our dear Savior. Gal. 2.1.
Oh my dear Galathians therefore I would to God they were cut off ^at do
disquiet you: for it pittieth my heart see the cockle so to hurt my corn: to
see the ^auen so to sour the lump of my good dough ^at I had among you: Gal.
5.9.
to see the false Apostls circumcision (indeed the authors of conci^on) by
their false and perilous persuasion to ^^t you off from Christ the tree of
life, where^^ ye did grow. O my dear Galathians there^^re I would to God they
were cut off that ^us disquiet you. This I take to be the whole nor of this
Apostolic wish: wherein I commend to your godly consideration, first, the
Apostles tender affection toward the people Galatia: 2 I note a difficulty
concerning ^s affection: 3. I note the estate and condition of al false
Prophets and Apostles: and lastly short application of all. Touching the fi^^^
point, ^. Part.
the Apostles affection how tender was and deeply set upon these people of
Galatia, the whole Epistle bears strong witne^ and evident proof. So that
how, and how pai^fully he traveled to teach the^, I shall not ne^ to tell you:
how careful he was that way, the^ state whereunto he had brought them does
^^ry sufficient tokens. Only this, to labor make them Christians: nay indeed
to bri^ them to the estate of Christians: to be do^^ and to feed on no grain
but the wheat: to be Eagles, and to pray upon no flesh but of t^^ Lamb: to
thirst and to drink of no well but Christ the well of God, Gal. 4.13.14. and
5.13.
the well of the water life: where they were lost sheep, to seek the^: seek
the^ as to find the^: being found to close t^^ in the fold of Christ, our
Savior, this Apostles love was great that did so lovingly t^^uel for them,
but this was not al: for he did ^^ only thus take care to bring them to the
fo^^ of Christ our Savior, Gal. 6.11
but to keep them in: n^ not only that, but where the Devil had plai^ the
crafty Fox, and got them out of the foul^ of Christ, Gal. 5.2.
and the^ fed them: not with truth, b^ with error: with circumcision: not with
christ with concision rather then circumcision: Gal. 5.4.
i^^^ed with gal, not with honey: with poison, not ^ith the sweet bread of life:
he took the pains (...) labor again in their behalf, and to reduce ^^em to
the fould from whence they were got^^n. His hearts desire was that they might
not ^ose the profit of their godly and good profes^^on, but that they might
return and have por^on, and profit together with him in the pre^ous passion of
Christ, which yet these false Apostles went about to make of none effect vn^^
the^. And though he might have turned his ^auel another way, for this their
unthankful ^uolt from Christ the way, the truth, and life, hereunto he had
brought them: yet did he ^t: but as he had been a mother to them, to ^nceaue
them, to travel for them, to bring ^^em forth to Christ: Gal. 4.19.
so did he not cease as another to travel again and again, that christ ^ight
a new be framed in them, where they ^d by folly and false subtilty of the
false Apo^^^es lost the very beuty of christ whereunto he ^^d brought the^. In
which his travel because ^e false Apostles did greatly travel to hinder ^m and
them: therefore even of mere zeal to ^ods glory and their salvation he brake
into ^is loving wish: O Galathians, Gal. 4.1^.
I would to ^od they were cut off that do disquiet you: which words do
argue a tender entireness of the Apostle over them: as that he wish their
health where they were wounded, the recall where they had straied, their
return the truth which they had received by him: Gal. 5.7.
the so their estate might be sure, and their salua^^on yea and Amen in Christ
Jesus, who could not otherwise profit them. Gal. 5.4. 2. Part.
But here it wi^^ demanded what the Apostle means thus burst out into so
vehement a wish as here he seth? For it may be thought more meet for
Apostolic spirit to confute then to curse: to soft then thus sharp: rather to
pity his enemy then to pray thus against them, would to G^^ they were cut off
that do disquiet you. Wher^unto I answer, that indeed many take the words of
the Apostle to be not against, but the behalf of the false Apostls: as that
Sai^^ Paul does not wish their hurt, but their g^^ therein: that as they had
taught circumcis^ before, and by that means stopped the people Galatia from
their godly course which the had begun in christ Jesus, Gal. 5.7.
and thereby did danger theirs and their own souls, so the might now at
length be cut off from that the perilous dealing, and called to the light of
t^^ gospel of christ, that so the Galathians mig^^ be no more disquieted, nor
their estate any l^ger endaungered: so that they will have the ^^rds of the
Apostle to be full of love and tender ^ection, not only toward the Galathians,
^^ose case he most pitied, but also toward ^ false Apostls, whose
conversion he also wi^d. And indeed I grant the Apostles wish ^^uld have bin,
that these false Apostles might ^^ue reclaimed their erroneous and damnable
^^xture of circumcision with the Gospel. And doubt not but his tender heart did
so tender ^ salvation of souls, that he could have wi^d them, and could have
been heartily glad to ^^ue seen them and these people of Galatia, both ^^gether
cut off from this their false persuasio^ ^^d dangerous: Nay I am persuaded that
nothing could have fallen out more to his joy the^ have seen the^ altogether,
as corn growing one field, as flowers flourishing in one gar^^n, as branches
bearing grapes in one vine, (...) knit together in the eye of Jesus Christ, as
^e white or apple of the same: but yet where he ^^w before his eyes the pittious
state wherein ^e Galathians stood, and how the false Apo^^^s had busied
themselves to bring them ther^^^to, and how they sought by all means, not on^^
to make, but to continue them as dogs, Gal. 4.17. Gal. 6.12.
^here they were once the darlings: as thorns, ^here they were once lillies:
strangers, where ^ey were once near: idle, where they once ran well: Gal. 5 7.
Gal. 3.1. Gal. 3.3.
fools where they were once wise: flesh^^ where they were once spiritual, and
gave ea^^ unto the spirit, that not only said it: but cri^^ and proclaimed it
in their hearts, that God Christ was only and wholly, fully and freel^ Abba,
father unto them: whereby his darlin^ was like to be devoured: his lilly in
Galatia be torn, Gal. 4.11.
his own crown and glory to be take from him, and Gods glory to lie in the
dust^ so grieved him that he burst out and said, ^ would to God they were cut
off that so disqu^^et you. Wherein he has principally respect Gods glory:
secondarily to the happy and sa^ estate of these Galathians: and thirdly to t^^
prosperous recovery of his labors among the which because they were greatly
hindered ^ the means of these false Apostles, therefore burst out even of zeal
and said thus: O would to God etc. In which words (to come to t^^ point) the
Apostle yet breaks not the bond charity, but keeps it, in that he thus
wishe^ not of private affection, but in respect of God glory, his church and
congregation, which had in Galatia planted happily, and yet the fal^^ Apostles
sought to destroy most craftily. Gal. 4.15.
No^ where evil is wished to the dross, that the go^ may be pure: evil to the
chafe, that the whea^^ may be fanned: evil to the leaue^, that the dou^^ ^y be
sweet: evil to the pitch, that the clean ^y be clean: euile to ye tare, that
the corn may safe: evil to the wolf that the sheep may be ^: ^n a word to wish
evil to the devil and to his ^rites and false Apostles, that the glory of God
^y be glorious and the church of god redeemed danger of them: zeal it is, evil
zeal it cannot ^ut very christian: the love of god co^straineth ^^ the love
that is due to the church of Christ ^^h beg and crave it. Neither indeed do I
take ^^se words of the Apostle, to be so much ^ordes of evil wish to his
adversaries, as ^^rds of good will to the people of Galatia: Gal. 5.10.
for much as he does not wish them evil simply, (...) in respect, because they
did trouble the ^urch, hinder and hurt her in her race: because ^y did disquiet
her. So that in respect of the ^^lathians, whose safety was dear unto him:
whose salvation Gods glory had bin glori^, in whose revolt from the truth and
continue therein, the false Apostles had stopped the ^^rse of the glory of God,
and brought their ^s to piteous case: (considering that it was ^^er yt many
dogs should die the death, then one dareling of Jesus Christ, much more ^^ so
many as were in Galatia) he might ^ly and did godly break out into these
words and say, o would to God they were cut off t^ do disquiet you.

3 Wherein we may see both what he ^sheth to the false Apostles and therein
their esta^ as also the cause of his wish. He wishes t^ were cut off: cut off
from the people of Gala^ cut off from the company of them: cut off fr^ the
number of Christians: nay cut off vtterl^ cursed everlastingly, before they
should bre^ such goodly plants, as he had planted, Apol^ had watered, and God
himself had blessed Galatia. O terrible wish to proceed from Apostle, to wish
their death and damnation yet o wish no less just the^ terrible: just to v^
the barren fig tree a curse: Mat. 21.16. Luc. 16.2. Ps. 1.4.
just to wish the f^ steward a reckoning: just to wish fire for st^ble: just to
wish wind to scatter the chafe, ^ that not simply, but in respect: least the
gr^ trees of the lord, least the children of his ta^ least his corn that grew
in Galatia sho^ take any hurt. For that was the cause (...) the Apostle did so
wish unto them, because t^ disquieted them. Which is the third n^ wherein if
you ask me wherein they did ^ quiet them, the whole Epistle bears wit^ They
did disquiet them, Gal. 2.
because they brou^ them in doubt of his Apostleshippe: disq^ them, Gal. 3.1.
because they taught a contrary doctr^ to him: disquiet them, Gal. 5.7.
because they did ^t suffer them to enjoy the truth that he had ^uen them:
disquiet the^, because they by such ^eans had brought them from faith to works,
Gal. 4.21. Gal. 5.3 13. Luc. 2.14. Ephe. 2.17.
^m grace to the law, from Christ to ceremo^es, from liberty to bondage, from
the peace conscience in Jesus Christ the true and only ^ace of God, to seek it
in circumcision, if not ^ly, yet with the gospel jointly: whereby they ^de
Christ Jesus (who is and will be in the ^tter of salvation either al in all, or
nothing all) no way profitable unto them: in a word, ^y did disquiet them,
because they by such ^ans took the peace of conscience from the^. But to come
to an application of al: dearly ^oued in our savior christ Jesus, as these
peo^^^ of Galatia had their Paul, by whose labori^s preaching they did attain
to the knowledge God the father in Christ his dearly beloved ^ne, so have you,
and with you, the people of (...) our land not wanted, but inioyed the same
^efite these many years, nay where you ^re withered branches, yet Paul has
plan^ and where you were ready to wither again (...) again, yet Apollo has
watered, and god (...) blessed you with heavenly knowledge: and ^ know it, and I
hope you al thank god for that we have been clouds and have given forth the
dew: candles and have given forth ^ light: the breasts of the spouse and have
offer^ milcke: her teeth and have divided the Man^ the meat: Cant. 4.11.
her tongs and have spoken (as Salmon speaks) no less than the very hunny
heaven unto you: and the Lord our God is ^ witness how we have traueled in
every pl^ to be fruitful wombes unto him among yo^ you your selves easily can,
and I hope for yo^ parts will thankefully witness, how we h^ been voices, and
what we have cried: how (...) have been hands, and what we have labor^ how we
have bin feet of, and for the Lord ^^sus, and how we have stood in this, and
ot^ like places to deliver out the gladsom tidi^ of heavenly peace unto you:
nay more tha^ t^ we have been writing these many years ((...) as S. Paul does
sweetly figure out the ^^ter) we thank the living, 1. Cor. 3.2.
and our most lou^ God, that we have written a fair and g^ Epistle among you:
so that all the world ^ run and read, not the name of superstit^^ and
superstitious devotion, but of truth, ^ Christian knowledge, and religion in
your ^ heads. You are the seals of our labors, are our crown, and glory, and
therein we glory: Luc. 13.34.
to hear Christ our hen clocking, you as christians following: to see you
wi^ fould of christ, and christ your sheepherd: to see (...) corns of christ,
ye lose of life: Ioh. 6.
to see you cal^ to the knowledge of the truth to consent to it, ^ome thus to
hear it, that you may continue (...) how it ioyeth our hearts? But alas though
(...) be our joy and happiness, to see you in this ^r happy estate; and
nothing could more glad ^he^ to see the branch abide in the vine: yet sa^ has
had and yet has his are abroad, wherwt ^ot only hacks, but hopes to hew down
the ^ch of christ in diverse places. Nay as it was Galatia, so has it bin and
so it is now in Eng^^^d: God grant that it be not: or (if it be not) yt ^ay not
be so among you. For satan has spi^ his your prosperous estate in Jesus Christ,
and ^ not spared almost in every place, every ^ to overthrow it. For what the
powers of world have don in this cause, I need not to ^ember you: and what his
false Apostles have ^ of late and yet do attempt, you are not ignorant. ^y you
know what devils have come unto ^^ shape of Angels: What Esaus under the ^e of
Jacob: What cutthroats under the ^e of Catholics: What Iudases under the ^e of
Jesus: And that, not only to corrupt ^ but also so far to disquiet you, as to
suck ^ery blood of Prince and people among you, were possible. By which means,
it is come to pass that the ship of Christ is not only daed with waves, but in
a manner ouerwhelm^ and his sheep not only pursued, but alm^ quite devoured in
many places: as was t^ therefore, so is our Galatia troubled. Nay (...) Scribes
and Pharisees to the disquieting of (...) church Apostolic wan Judas from
christ o^ savior, Ioh. 18.2.3.
and of an Apostle made him an A^stata. Gal. 3.1.
These false Apostles bewitched the Galathians, and made them fools: where t^
were in the way to run out: they went ab^ by their mixture of circumcision
with the g^^pell, Gal. 3.4.
to make the gospel of Christ fruitles v^ them. Oh would to God Scribes and
Phari^ were not in this our land: o would to God t^ no familiars had played by
their means the p^ of Judas with Christ our savior, o would to ^ that many
Galathians that run well, had been stayed and stopped from the good course t^
had begun. But alas we want not in this ^ day the man that plaieth Judas: nay
alas vn^ the name of Jesus, they have been and amongst us, that have sought
and do seek their false persuasion to make the true C^^^stian a Judas: nay
alas they do it in diu^ places already: and even yet they spare no ^uel to
make you al Apostataes. They ca^ abide to see you come to these our congreg^
^s: they cannot abide to see you gather to serve ^e living lord: they cannot
abide the flourishing the truth that we deliver faithfully, and you ^^ceiue
obediently from us: yea it grieueth the^ the very heart to see so many ears in
(...) house of our god, the word of god in known ^nner offered unto you: but
above all things which was the only thing that among and a^^e all spited these
false Apostles to the very ^rt) that Christ should be preached as a full, a
free Jesus only, unto you and among you. ^d therefore our adversaries cry out
against (...) gospel of Christ, that, that faith, which ^orketh by charity,
should only be said to ^ify and save (which is our proposition neither ^re
nor less) for which cause as these false A^tles to the disquieting of this
church of Ga^a mingled circumcision and grace, and taught (...) gospel to be
unavailable, unless circumci^ were used as necessary: (by which means ^y
deceived many) so also our adversaries do ^^gle works with faith: and teach
salvation ^ome not only by faith, but also by works: which means many of the
simple are cari^ ^way from us, and lose the profit of our sa^urs gospel. But
here, because by the way ^y do except, by the way I am to answer: ^y except
the comparison not to be just: whereas yet as these Apostles joined together
c^^cumcision and Christ, so do they couple the ^^rites of their works and
Christ. But he^ they except that circumcision was a matter the Law
ceremonial, which did not, wh^ could not justify: but as for good woorks the
are duties of the Law moral, which both ^ and do justify: but I answer,
that indeed for circumcision: truth it is, that it neither d^ neither could
execute that office: and no less d^ say of the duties of the law moral. For
thou it be a principle in divinity (confessed also our adversaries) that Lex
impleta does just care, and iustificatos seruare) that the Law ful^^^led does
justify and save the just: yet touchi^ the categoricall and positive
(whereabout question is) I find it not to be true, that any does actually or
can possibly fulfill the la^ and therefore be justified and saved by the la^ But
here again they except, that then god h^ commanded things impossible. Whereunto
I ^swere, that as for the impossibility of the commandment, it is no matter of
absurdity: ^ it is a point of the catholic verity taught scriptures, to be
confessed by all: the Apo^ S. Peter in the 15. of the Acts does witn^ no less,
and our adversaries themselves d^ say no less: but here again they except,
tha^ (...) the place of S. Peter, it concerns points the law ceremonial,
which was but a Law ^mporall: but as for good works they are ^ties of the Law
moral, that binds al men and ^al ages, so that if the duty thereof and therein
^ God of us exacted, were impossible, God ^ere proved a cruel and rigorous God.
Where^^to I answer first, that touching the per^^tualnes or temporalnes of
the commaun^ment, that is nothing, whence the impossi^^enesse is granted for a
truth: 2 I answer, ^at as for the duties of the law moral, though ^ey bind
perpetually and yet be impossible be performed by the Godly: yet is not God
^ereby proved a cruel and rigorous god, but (...): ^ cause he demands
nothing but his due; ^e? Yea what man's conscience calls duty and ^^nfesseth
to be due: now to ask nothing but ^e: yea what man cannot but confess to be
^e, that is no cruelty, no rigor but justice: ^d therefore to answer more
fully: as for the ^ties of the law moral, God asks therein thing but what
man should perform. Ther^e nothing but duty: yea nothing but what ^an could
perform: nothing therefore but ^ety: yea nothing but possible duty: which
^^ough now he cannot perform: and there^re now finds the law impossible,
that is because when he could and therefore had possibility (...) perform it,
yet he would not: so that that i^possibility argues not Gods cruelty and
rigou^ but justice on his part: on our behalf our miserable infirmity, and yet
voluntary miser^ Nay their own Hugo de Victore in his annotations upon this
chapter says that man ^^ not love God with all his heart, soul etc. in the
life, and therefore is not to seek salvation (...) merits but only in grace.
Wherefore to ^^mit all large and yet easy apologies in the point, it is flat
in conclusion that our aduers^ries offend no less to the disquieting of t^^
church now in adding works moral, the did these false Apostles in the time
of this Ap^stle in adding woorks ceremonial to the go^pell: for both ways the
church finds disquie^nes: both ways christ is made vnprofitabl^ Now therefore
(Dear beloved) since by the their legal, indeed impossible, and therefo^^ no
gospel, our adversaries bar many a^ seek to bar you from al possibility
of salu^tion: since all their endeavor is to make you t^ Disciples not of faith
but of works, not grace but of merit, not of the gospel but the law, not
of christ but of Moses: and so v^der the name of Jesus do fight indeed again
the glory of the Gospel of Jesus and safe your souls: since there is such
venom, such ^yson, such peril among you and for you a^ade by reason of them:
since they the servants ^atan busy themselves every way to bring you this most
miserable stay and piteous state; oh ^ at shall I say but with the Apostle, I
would to ^^d they were cut off that thus do seek to cor^t you: oh would to God
they were cut off ^t thus disquiet you. For you are dearly belo^ in happy case:
and where your fathers were in ^t miserable plight, yt they could not, should ^
(the key of knowledge being taken and kept from ^m) know God and his Christ:
yet you ^w both, yea and it is our joy to see you thus like of christ the bread
of life that we diu^^e ^o you: and happy are you all, to your eu^r^ing comfort
we assure you all, that hun^er ^ feed by faith upon him: and I trust that ^n
in your own hearts you are often joyful and ^ry many a time to think upon this
our ac^ted time, wherein you have the food of ^r souls so fully and freely
broken unto you. ^d therefore since these evil nurses of Rome ^k to feed you
with trust in your own works ^^ch you perform: and merits which they ^ imagine
of you (which you do not, yea being ^ers cannot perform, and therefore needs
^st famish you, if that you trust to them) and not only of Christ: who yet was
and is the on^ alone loaf of life broken upon the cross for ^ sins, and
alone by faith able and withal r^dy to feed you, oh would to God they w^ cut
off that thus do seek to corrupt you: would to God they were cut off that
the disquiet you; not that we could not wish the better: for (alas) we know
the price of soul^ and acknowledge the grace and good will our gracious God
that way: and you can witness with and for us, that in our gener^ assemblies
and public prayers we pray for speedy conversion and salvation of them: na^
would do our hearts good to see the Goat ^ome a Lamb: to see the thorn become
a li^ (...) there were but one fould and one sheephea^ o^ us all: but alas be
our charity never so gr^ t^wardes them: though we pray for the^ when they
curse us: though we bless the^ where they persecute us: though we preach a^
pen, take careful care every way to disco^ their untruth, that they may leave
it, to bri^ them to the light of the truth that they (...) cleave unto it, yet
alas they condemn our c^ritie: they continue their wilful race, and their
travel is how to root up the goodly vn^^ yard that God by us has planted
amo^^ you: day and night they watch to steal the g^ of Syon from you: they
spite the brightness the golden candlestick of Christ among you, ^herby they
seek the ruin of your happy estate ^herein you now stand, utterly and to drown
the ^yce of the turtle now heard in our land: and ^^erfore oh what ca^ I say,
but oh would to god ^^ey were cut off that thus do seek to grieve (...): I
would to god they were cut off that thus ^quiet you.

Oh but this is no charitable wish you will ^^e. I have answered and answer
further, ^at we wish them well with all our hearts: but ^^t when we consider the
stifnes of them in er^^: yea how resolute they are in defense of their
^^resies: and how earnestly they travel from place (...) place to corrupt me^
that embrace the truth: ^^a how they condemn and curse true chri^^ans, and
thirst after nothing more then the ^^solation of God his holy temple among us,
^^her by persuasion, or if that preuail not, yet ^ treachery, force and
cruelty: when I thus ^^member how they are and will be nothing but ^^re, to
trouble, yea to choke you the goodly ^^n of our savior christ, and how they
labor and ^^ke the pains to chase the poor woman a^^ne to the wilderness,
upon whose breasts ^^u do now quietly take your fill of the sincere ^ilk of the
hony-sweet gospel, the very power of God to save your souls, I cannot choose
(...) wish with this our Apostle: oh would to G^^ they were cut off that do
disquiet you. N^ therefore that we wish not their conversion not therefore
that we wish not consequent their salvation: not therefore that we ow the^
charity (as they uncharitably do slander o^ charity) but since they profess
themselves e^mies to the truth, and that they may not o^ darke^ but bury it, do
by all means travel it, you al know, and this our day is a lively and
^mentable witness, oh would to God they we^ cut off that so disquiet you. In a
word to conclude: our hearts desire and continual prayer God is, that his
gospel may have a free cou^^ among you: that the light of the world may
c^^tinue with you: that the dew of heaven may (...) drop upon you: that this
day of knowledge, the day of comfort in christ your dear savior m^ not be
darckned again by antichrist: that t^ Dove that now does rest in the holes
of t^ rock (as Solomon speaks) be not driven aga^ to take to her wings and
elsewhere to seek h^ rest: this dearebeloued is our wish and dai^^ prayer to
God for you, even that you may (...) thus and in this comfortable and happy
estate, the gods mercy may still compass you and his na^ be glorious among you:
and therefore when ^^tichrist is abroad and his Angels among us, (...) has
even at this very hour moved the ^wrs of the world against us, who only spite
(...) hope to spit at our peace and plenty, our flo^h and prosperity in the
truth of our savior: or that cause seek not only abroad to troble ^r brethren,
but even at home to set Caine to ^w his sword upon Abel: yea to store our la^d
^th troble where there is quietness: with war ^ere there is peace: with
scarcenes, where ^re is plenty: with tears where there is joy: (...) to store
and stream our streets with the ^od of old and young, man, woman and child
^ong us: yea to take away the course of gods ^y word from us: and to make this
our land ^lace for that owl of Rome, that now is a ^ce for the tal tree of
christ, wherein the fouls the air do build their nestes and quietly rest, ^
would to God they were cut off that thus ^e seek to molest you: yea oh would
to God ^y were cut off that thus disquiet you. Not ^t you need (dear beloved)
to fear the force flesh whatsoever: not that this woorld shall ^t you, though
it never so deeply hate you: ^not Satan that prince of hell, that god of this
^^rld (for God has numbered the very hairs (...) your heads: he has care
over a sparrow, ^ch more over you:) but because we could wish that the gospel
of christ might still run among you: that mother Rachel might enio^ this her
comfortable day with you: that h^ children might quietly suck upon her breasts
that neither Herod nor antichrist might d^quiet them: that so the truth of
Christ mig^^ triumph, and the devil of Rome be still trod ^ the dust, to your
great joy here, and to your pe^petuall safety hereafter: in which respect as
beegan, so for this time I conclude and man an end: I would to God they were
cut off the do disquiet you. Cut off from your compan^ cut off from your
congregations: cut off from the land: cut off and not permitted by foolish
p^tie and charity; yea cut off utterly and curs^ everlastingly before they
should either by ^resy corrupt you, or by violence and force ban^ the truth of
christ from amongst you: rath^ then either of these should fall out, I say it
a^ say it again and again, and that with chari^ object what they please: oh
would to God the were cut off that do disquiet you. Oh the^fore that Papists
were cut off from the la^ for they are the traitorous and tirannous ^^rits of
this our time, who have and still do seek disquiet you. God therefore look upon
us w^ the eye of his favor, and deliver us from the^ And sound your Amen to
this conclusion.
