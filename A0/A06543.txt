I am now take and stand under danger
Hold straight that I may not flee
A dew my song and all my notes clear
Now that I have lost my liberte
Now I am thrall where sometime I was free
And trust well while I am in distress
I can not sing nor make no gladness
And though my cage forged were of gold
And the pynacles of berell and cristall
I remember a proverb said of old
Who loses his fredom forsothe he loses all
For I had lever upon a branch small
Merrily to sing among the woods grene
Than in a cage of silver bright and shene
Song in prison has none acordance
Trowst thou I will sing in prison
Song proceeds of Joy and of plesance
And prison causes death and destruction
Ryngyng of feters is no merry sown
Or how should he be glad or Ioconde
Again his will that lies in cheynes bond
What auaylleth hit a lion to be a king
Of bestes all shette in a toure of stone
Or an egle under streyte keeping
Called also king of fowls euerichone
Fie on lordship when liberte is gone
Answer herto late hit not asterte
Who syngeth merrily that syngeth not at heart
And if thou will rejoice of my syngyng
Late me goo flee fer from all danger
And every day in the morenyng
I shall repair unto thy lawrer
And fresshly sing with lusty notes clear
Under thy chamber or a fore thyn halle
Every season when thou list me call
To be shette up and pynned under dread
No thing acordeth unto my nature
Though I were fed with milk and wastell bread
And with cruddes brought to my pasture
Yet had I lever to do my besy cure
Erly on morrow to scrape in the vale
To find my dinner among the worms small
