An confortable exhortation: of our most holy Christen faith / and her
fruits Written (unto the Christian brethren in Scotla^de) after the poor word
of God.

Our glory


At Parish* M.d.xxxv.

Ihon Ihon sone an humile professor of holy divinity / do great you all / with
grace and peace / in the lord
The eternal faueour of almygty God be vith you / strength you / and keep you /
according to his godly pleasure that ye be found without any spot / at the
coming of the lord / when he shall reward every man after his deades

Belowed brethren I give laud and thanks unto my God / for he has made you
rych in all godly virtue / for your faith grows excedingly / and eueryche
one of you flows ower in low to ward a another among your sylfes and to
ward al me^. God has blessed you / with all manner of spiritual blessings /
in heavenly things / by Christ / according as he has chosen you in him
through low / before ye fundation of the world was laid. And he has ordained
you to be holy / and without blame in his sight / and has chosen you before
unto him sylfe / to be heirs of his eternal glory through Jesus Christ / by
whom ye have redemption / that is to say / forgeuinge of sins. And he has
openned unto you / the mystery of his will. And has sealed you with ye sprite
of promise / which is the ernest of your enheritance / to redeem the possession
purchassed unto the laud of his glory. Wherefore I give thanks unto my God /
and prays for you with gladness / because of the fellishippe which ye have in
the Gospel from the first day unto now. And I am sure certifieth of this /
that he which began an good work in you / shall perform it unto the day of
Jesus Christ / as it becomes me to judge of you all. Thanks be unto God
beloweth brethern / ye neade nor to be teach it of any man for that ointment
which ye have receawith theachit you all things. Nor withsto^dinge I will not
be negligent to put you in remembrance of your duty / thought ye know it
your sylfes / and are also stabilisshed in the present truth. For I thynk it
mete as long as I am in this tabernacle to stere you up by puttynge^ on in
remembrance / for as much as i am sure how that the time is at hand / that i
must put of this my tabernacle I will enfoarce therefore / that on every side ye
might have wherewith to stere up the remembrance of this things after my
departing. The good that i mo do unto you / i will not prolonge / when i am
present with you / i will exhort you by word (ye by the word of God) as my
dear brethren in the lord. When i am absent by writtinge unto a prosperous
journey (by the will of God) fortune me to come unto you / and have co^solacion
to gyther with you through ye co^me^ faith / which both ye and^ have. Be not
displeased of my ho^melynes (dearly beloweth) for low causes me to judge of
you even as my sylfe / i do unto you as i would ye did unto me / for i am yours
/ and ye are mine / and ve all are Christis / and Christ is Gods so ve are Gods
aune possession. Sen ye are of God / ye / ye will gladly hear Gods word. And
that causes me to writ^ the boldly are / for in my writtinge and saying both
present and absent / ye shall nor find the word of man / but the very true
word of God. And above in you some what i trust and rejoice / and that causes
me to writ this little treatise rather unto you / then to any other. And ever i
will exhort you / as my well beloweth brethern in the lord / besechynge you to
receive it with patience. And thought my knowdledge a greith not well to soch
an office / yet after the grace given unto me of God / i have obeyit. In the
which ye that are of faith / shall feale his mighty powere / thought ye find
no worldly visdome / for ye preachinge off ye cross is to them that perisshe /
folisshnes. But unto you which are saved / it is the powere off God / whois
grace remane ever with you and make you strong in his invincible truth. Amen

Of faith
BElowed brethren above all thing be strong and steadfast in your faith /
Ephe. vi
as S Paul teached. Above all / take ye ye shield of faith / wherewith ye may
quench all the fyrie darts of ye wicked. i. Petri v.
Therefore be ye sober and watch for your adversary the devil as an roringe
Lion walker about / sekinge whom he may denore / whom resist steadfast in the
Faith As Ihon says i^ his revelation Behold ye devil shall cast of you in
presone / Apoca. ii
to te^pte you be faithful unto the deeth / and I shall give y^ an croune of
life. Vithout this faith says Paul / Hebreo. xi
It is impossible to please God. Therefore be strong in your faith. This faith
is the very rock where on the chirch is hildeth as says our saueour / Math.
xvi
ap one this rock I vilbilde my congregation / i Corin. iij.
And Paul says in an other place. No man can lay a another fundation then that
which is laid which is Jesus Christ / that is tho say / yt faith of Jesus
Christ / and in an other place says he / ye now are no moare strangers and
foreners / Ephe. ij.
but citesins with the saynctes and of the household of God / and are bildet
apo^ the fundacion of the Apostles and Prophets / Jesus Christ being the heed
corner stone / in whom every bildinge coupled to gether / grows unto an holy
temple in the lord / in whom ye also are but to gether / and made an
habitacion for God in ye sprite. Apo. xxvi
The fundacion of the wall of the cite says Ihone was garnisshed with all manner
of precious stonis. The fundacion of the cite of Jerusalem (the chirch of
almigty God) is faith which is garnisshed with the great mercy and goodness of
God abundantly / as with all manner of precious stonis / or with all kind of
good works precious and acceptable unto God / for faith can nor be ydel / bot
works through low / Galath. ^ Mathei vij
ye good to all man / like as a good tree brings forth good fruit / a good
tree ca^ not bring forth bade fruit. Also an good man out of ye good treasure
of his heart bri^geth forth good things. Faith through low is mighty in
operacion / Gala. v Gala. 3. iiij Roma. v i Corin. xiij Apoca. xxi
for faith brings the sprite of God and the sprite of God brings low. And
low works no ewil / but al good So faith continualy works good to all man
/ and may be callit the fu^dacio^ garnished with all manner of precious stonis.
For by faith ve are justifies / and made righteous before God. Roma. iij
As it is written. Now merely is the righteuesnes that comes of God /
declared without the fulfillinge of the law having witness both of the law
and of ye Prophets. The righteuesnes no dout which is good before God /
comes by the faith of Jesus Christ / unto all and upon all that believe. For
there is no difference: all have sinned / and lack the praise that is of
valor before God / but are justified freely by his grace through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus / whom God has made an seat of mercy / through faith in
his blood / to show the righteuesnes which before him is of valor / in that
he forgeueth the sins that are passhed / which God did sofre to sheue at this
time / the righteuesnes that is allowed of him / that he might be counted just
/ and an iustifiar of him that beleuith on Jesus Christ. Where is then thy
reioysinge? it is excludet. By what law? by the law of works? nay but by
the law of faith. We suppose therefore that an man is justified by faith /
without the deades of the law. Is he God of the jews only? is he not the God
also of the gentyls? he is (no dout) God also of the gentyls / for it is God
only which justified circumcision / which of faith / and vncircumcisio^ through
faith

If Abraham were justified by deades then has he wherein to rejoice / but not
with God. For what says the scripture. Roma. iiij.
Abraham believed God / Gene. xv
and it was counted unto him for righteuesnes

To him that works the reward is not reckened of favor / but of duty. To
him that works not / but believes on him that justified the ungodly / is
faith reckened for righteuesnes. Psalm. xxxi
Even as David describes the blessed fulness of an man / unto whom God
ascribes righteuesnes without deades. Blessed are they / whose vnrighteuesnes
is forgeuen / and whose sins are covered / blessed is that man / to whom the
lord imputes not sin. Came this blessedness then upon the circumcised or upon
the uncircumcised? we say verily how yat faith was reckened to Abraham for
righteuesnes How was it reckened? Gene. xv
In the time of circumcicision / or in the time before he was circumcised? Not
in the time of circumcision / but when he was yet uncircumcised And he received
the sign of circumcision as an seal of that righteuesnes which is by faith /
Gene. xvii
which faith he had / yet being uncircumcised. That he should be the father of
all them that believe / thougt they be not circumcised / that righteuesnes might
be imputed to them also. Abraham was made strong in the faith / and gave
honor to God / and steadfastly believed that he which had made the promise was
able also to make it good / and therefore was it reckened to him for
righteuesnes. Roma. iiij.
It is not written for him only / that it was reckened to hyme for righteuesnes
/ but also for us / to whom it shall be counted for righteuesnes / so we believe
on him that raised up Jesus the lord from deeth. As says Paul be cause that
we are justified by faith / we are at peace with God / Roman^. v
through our lord Jesus Christ. The Ge^tils which follows not righteuesnes /
Roma. ix
have over taken righteuesnes. I mean ye righteuesnes which comes of faith.
But Israel which follows the law of righteuesnes / could not attain unto ye
law of righteuesnes. And wherefore? because they sought it not by faith / but
as it were by the works of the law. For they have stombled at the stomblinge
stone. As it is written Behold I put in Syo^ an stomblinge stone and an rock
on which shall men faule / Esai. xxviij
and none that believe on him shall be ashamed. Romano. x
I bear Israel record says Paul / that they have an fervent mind to God
ward / but not according to knouledge. For they are ignorant of the
righteuesnes / which is aloued before God / and goo about to stablisshe their
aune righteuesnes. And therefore are not obedient unto the righteuesnes which is
of value before God. For Christ is the end of the law / to justify all that
believe / and in ye same chap. says he. The believe of ye heart justified. And
in an other place. We know yt no man is justified by the deades of law / but
by the faith of Jesus Christ / Gala. iii.
and we have beleuet on Jesus Christ / that we might be justified by ye faith
of Christ / and noth by the deades of the law. Gala. iii
Abraham believed God / and it was counted unto him for righteuesnes /
understand therefore that they which are of faith / are the childerne of
Abraham. The scripture saw before hand that God would justify the gentiles
through the mouths of lions / quenched the violence ^f fire / eschaped the edge
of the swearde / of weak were made strong / woxet valient in fight / turned
to flight the armees of the alientis. The women received their deed / to life
again wother were racked / and would not be delivered / yt they might receive
a better resurrection. Wother tasied of mochingis and scourgyndis / moreower of
bonds and presonment / were stoned were heawen a sunder / were tempted were
slain with sweardes / walked up and down in shepes skynnes / in gotes
skynnes / in need tribulacion and vexation / which the world was not worthy
of. They wandered in wilderness / in mountains / in dens and cayes of the earth.
And these all thoroue faith obtained good report and received not the promise.
God prouidinge an better thing for us / that they without us should not be
made perfect

Belowed bethren it is written The eyes of the lord beholds faith / ^ieremi.
v
that is to say. The lord takes pleasure of faith / and faueours them in
whom he finds faith / and imputed not their sins unto them for the pleasure
which he has of their faith / he loket not to their sins / but he looks to
their faith as says ye scripture. ^sal. xxxiii
Dearly beloved / this faith where of I speak is not feigned faith / nether
deed faith / nether infruteful faith / which takes name after ye opinion of
me^ / but it is perfect faith / quycke lyuinge faith / which works ye
pleasure of God / Galath. v
from ye heart of poor low This faith is not had be ye devils nether by
wicked and ungodly me^ / but by ye saynctes of God / ye the childerne and
heirs of God. Whom he had called unto the supper of life. Apoca. xix
Nether mo the man which had this faith / consent to do any thing against ye
law of God for his heart is so up lyfted through low / yt he foryettes his
own profit and pleasure / and continually seeks the pleasure of God / and the
profit of his brethren This faith is callit / the faith of the Gospel and it
is an sure confidence (or trust) in God that he is faithful / and will without
any dout fulfill they things which he of his great mercy has promised unto us
in Christ Ensample we have of faithful Abraham / whois faith was counted unto
him for righteuesnes. And his faith was an sure confidence (or trust) in the
promise of God / as says Paul. Abraham contrary to hope believed in hope / Roma.
iiij.
that he should be the father of many nations / according to that which was
spoken. So shall thy seed be / and he faynted not in the faith / nor yet
consideret his aune body / which was now deed / even when he was almost an
hundred year old. Nether considered he the barenes of Sara. He sta^kered not
at the promise of God through unbelief / but was made strong in the faith / and
gave honor to God and steadfastly believed / that he which has made the promise
was able also to make it good / and therefore was it reckened to him for
righteuesnes. It is not written for him only / that it was reckened to him for
righteuesnes / but also for us: to whom it shall be counted for righteuesnes / so
we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from deeth. Here Paul shewet
what faith was in our father Abraham / we should believe in hope / contrary to
hope as did Abraham / which contrary the hope of his natural strength or powere
/ belewed in the strength and powere of God infulfilli^ge his promise. So should
we believe surly to obtain they things which God has promised to us / thought
they be vnpo^sible to us to obtain them after our natural weak powere.
Joan. iij
God has promised to us eternal life / which is impossible to us to obtain
after our weak natural powere because we are sinners / ^ Joan. i
yet thougt it be impossible to us to obtain it of our sylfes: because we are
sinful. Math. xix
It is not impossible to God to give it to us / according to his promise.
Therefore let us with Abraham believe in hope / above hope / in Gods righteuesnes
above our vnrighteuesnes. Roma / iij* Iacobi ij Phili. ij.iiij Galatas iij
In gods truth above our lies. In Gods mercy: above our synfulnes. In Gods
power / above our weakness. Let us have faith with Abraham in gods promyses.
Ioannis i i Corin. ij
And we shall reioy with Abraham in receawinge of the same things promised.
This faith is not known of the world / nether be ye natural man it / for it
is an super natural gift given unto man freely by god. Ephesi. ij
As says Paul ye are made save by faueoure throw faith / and that not of
your sylfes / for it is the gift of god / and comes not of works / lest
any man should bost him sylfe. Belowed brethern sen ye mo not have this faith
of your sylfes / but it is an excellent gift of god (mother of all godly
virtue) which he of his kyndnes and mercy geweth unto you freely. Therefore cry
with the Apostles unto ye lord / Luce xvij Marci ix
to increase your faith. And with the man which has the possessed son:
which said o lord i believe / sucker mine unbelief. That god seen ge your
powerte in the sprite: and taking heed to your peteous complain mo grant
your peticion / and make you rych by his precious gift of faith. Roma. ix.x
And not only seek ye your own health / but the health of your brethern /
praye^ge to god to sent faith on the ertha^d plant it in all quarters yt all
nation may praise god / which only has immortalite / and duellit in light:
that no man may attain / whom newere man saw nether cane se / unto whom be
honor and rule euerelastinge. Amen

Of unfaithfulness
DEarly belowed brethern / unfaithfulness is the mother of allwice and sin /
for it brings forth all kind of sin and evil. ^ath. vij
Like wise as evil fruit comes of an evil tree. So of unfaithfulness comes
no thing but evil. As aduo^rie / fornication / vnclemes / wanta^nes /
ydolatrie / witchecraft / hatred / zele / ^ath. xv ^a. v
wra^th / strife / sedition / partetakinges / enuyinge / murder / dronckennes
glottony / and soche like* As says our saueoure an evil man out of the evil
treasure of his heart brings forth evil things. ^ath xij
This evil treasure is unfaithfulness / which brings forth all kind of evil
and sin / be which cause it is only before God / reckened sin / as says
our saueoure. The holy ghost when he shall come shall rebuke ye world of sin
/ (...). xvi
be cause they believe not on me. And it makes an man worthy of eternal
damnation / as it is written. Whosoever believes not shall be damp^ct. And in a
another place. ^ar. xvi
Heth at believes not is conde^pned already. Joan.iij
This unfaithfulness makes god to hat us / Ephe. v
as says the scripture The wraeth of God comes upon the children of
unbelief. And in a another place says Ihon the baptiser. He that believes not
the son / shall not se life: Joan.iij
but the wraeth of God abides on him. Unfaithfulness is no other thing: but
lacking of faith / even as darkness is but the lacking of light. So the
unfaithful lacks faith / and be ye same cause / all that comes of faith: as
hope / low / joy: peace: long sofferynge / ge^tlenes / goodness / Gala. v
keeping of promise: meknes te^peraunce and ce. And in stead of them is full of
allwice / as vane presumption: hatred: dispare and all abomination. Nether is
it possible to him to low god or his brethren / Hebre. xi Psalm. xxxij Roma.
xiiij
nor to do any thing pleasesynge to god. For whatsoever comes not of faith /
ye same is sin. For he is by nature evil / and perceaueth not ye things of
ye sprite of God: Gene. viij i Corin. ij
for they are but folishnes unto him. He is blind and knows not where hence
he goo: but is led by ye power of darkness. Of ye unfaithful says Paul If our
gospel yet be hid: ij. Corin. iiij
it is hid among the^ yt are lost: in whom the God of this world has blinded
ye minds of the^ which believe not: lest should shine unto the^ ye light of ye
glorious gospel of christ: which is ye image of God: and in a another place

^cobii
The unfaithful is like ye wawes of the sea tossed of the wind / and carried with
violence nether let that man think that he shall receive any thing of God. A
wauerynge minded man is unstable in all his ways. Belowed brethern / this i
say not to your rebuke / but to theyrs whosoever lacks faith which shall be
known and iudget of the faithful / by their fruits. As says our saueoure.
^athei vij
Ye shall know them by their fruits Herefor study and labor / that ye be not
found unfruitful but that your unfeigned faith mo be known by her fruits /
and your brethern mo see her fruits / ^athei v
and glorify your father which is in heaven. For there is many (of whom alace
with sorrow i compain) That confess / ^itum i
that they know God / but with deades they deny him / and are abominable /
^mano. ij
and disobedyent / and unto all good works discommendable. They do shayme (so
much as is in the^) to our most holy faith. ^ma. xvi
They seek in all things the liberty of the flesh / and not the praise of
the lord / nor the health of there brethern / and do dishonor the gospel of
God. This i say that ye knowo^de soch fautes in others awoyde them from your
sylfes: and behave your sylfis / ^he. v
as it becomes saynctes. And bear your fruit in holiness. As says Paul.
^omano. vi ^tum iij
Ye which believe in god / be studious ^goo forward in good works. This
thyngis are good / and profitable unto men. Folisshe questions / and
genealogies / and braulingis / and strife about the law awoyde / for they are
unprofitable / and superfluus. A man that is the auctor of sects after the
first and the second amonition awoyde / remembrynge that he that is soche /
Mark well
is perverted / and synneth / even damned by his own judgment. Of these
thyngis i would ye were certifieth (my brethern) for now is the last time. And
as ye have herd how that Antechrist shall come / i Joan.ij
eue^ now are there many Antechristes come all ready. Beware of the false
prophets which come to you in shepes clothing: Mathei vij
but inwardly they are raueninge wolves: ye shall know them by their fruits.
So men gaddre grapes of thorns? or figs of brires? even so every good tree
/ brings forth good fruit. But a corrupt tree / brings forth evil fruit. A
good tree can not bring forth bad fruit. Nor yet can a bad tree bring forth
good fruit. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit / shall be heawen down
/ and cast in to the fire / wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not
all they that say unto me / master / master / shall enter in to the kingdom of
heaven / but he that fulfilleth my fathers will / which is in heaven. Many will
say to me in that day / master / man have we not in thy name prophesied? and
in thy name have we not cast out deuyls? and in thy name have we not done many
miracles? and then will i knoudledge unto them that I newer knew the^. ^al. vi
^ma. xvi
Depart from me ye workers of iniquite I beseech you brethern mark them which
cause division / and gewe occasions of evil / contrary to the doctrine which ye
have learned (of the ointment which ye have of the holy ghost) and awoyde them.
^oan. ij
For they that are soch serve not the lord Jesus Christ / but their own
belyes / and by sweet preachynges and flattering words deceive the hertes of
the innocents. ^oma. i
For your obedience (unto the truth) is publeshed through out among all
christian brethern. I am glad (no dout) of you / but yet I would have you wise
unto that which is good: and to be innocent as concerning evil. ^oma. xvi
The God of peace / shall tread satan under your fete in short time. To him
that is of power to stabilishe you according to the Gospel: wherewith Jesus
Christ is preached unto you in opening of the mystery which was kept closse
from you a long time a goo through belly wisdom / I mean ye craft of ye
ypocrites. And now is ope^ned at this time / and declared in the holy scrip^
heavenly father. Math. vi Joan. iij
Which spared not his aune son / but gave him for us all. Wherefore no
dispare mo have place in you / for as says Paul. Roma. viij
Ye have not received the sprite of bondage to fear any moare / but ye have
received the sprite of adoption whereby ye cry abba father. God your father is
merciful ye and very merciful / says the scripture And his mercy he will not
deny unto his own children / which are ye / Psalm. lxxxv Mat. xxiiij Roma.
viij.
so ye keep sure the faith of the Gospel. Herefore trust sure in the lord /
for there is no damnation to you which are in Christ Jesus / which walk not
after the flesh / but after the sprite for the law of the sprite wherein is
life through Jesus Christ / has delivered you from the law of sin and
deeth. For what the law could not do in as much as it was weak because of
the flesh / that performed God / and sent his son in the similitude of
sinful flesh / and by sin / dampened sin in the flesh / that the
righteuesnes required of the law / might be fulfilled in you / which walk not
after the flesh / but after the sprite. etc. It is God that justifies you /
who then shall condemn you? it is Christ which is deed / ye rather which is
ryse^ again / i. Corin^ vi i. Petri i. Psalm. ij
which is also at the right hand of God and makes intercession for you. Ye
are dearly bought. Ye are Christis own possession. Ye are members of Christ.
(...): vi and xij ^he. ij ^etri v ^al. liiij
And the very household of God. Wherefore doubt not / for he cares for you /
cast roure care on the lord / and he shall nouresshe you. To put all fear /
all dredoure: and all dispare / from you / Christ has given you consolation
saying. ^ce xij
Fear not little floocke / for it is your fathers pleasure / to give you an
kingdom. Be not careful: ^ath. vi
for your heavenly father knows what ye have neade of / and will ministre all
necessary things unto you

^ath. vij
Axe and it shall be given you / seek and ye shall find / knock and it shall be
opened unto you / for whosoever areth receaueth: and he that seeks finds /
and to him that knocks it shall be opened. Is there any man among you which
would profer his son a stone if he axeth him breed? or if he axeth fisshe /
would he profer him a serpent? if ye then which axe evil / can give to your
children good gifts / how much moare shall your father which is in heaven /
give good things to them that axe of him?

Corin. vi
I will dwell among you and walk among / and will be your God / and ye shall be
my people I will be an father unto you / and ye shall be unto me sons and
daughters says the lord God almighty. Hiere. xxxi
Behold the days shall come (says the lord) and I will fynnisshe upon the
house of Israel / and apone the house of Judah / an new testament not like as the
Testament that I made with their fathers at that time when I took them by the
hand / to leed them out of the land of Egipte. For this is the testament
that I will make unto the house of Israel / after their days / I will put my
laws in their minds / and in their hertes I will writ them / and I will be
their God / and they shall be my people. And they shall not teach every man his
neybour / and every man his brothre saying know the lord / for they shall
know me from the leest to the greatest of them / for I willbe merciful to
them on their iniquites and sins / and on their vnrighteuesnes will I not
think any moare

I the lord defend / Esaie. xxvij
and water her in the due time. I keep her day and night lest any man invade
her. I am with out all wrath / who then mo so mow me to be so great an
enemy to her that I my promise neglecte?

Esa. xxxviij
I shall fight for this city / and shall defend it (says the lord) and shall
save it for my namys sake. Esaie xl
Be of good chere / be of good chere / my people (says your God) se that ye
counforte the hertes of Jerusalem / and tell them of their reest and
deliverance from captivity / tell them how their sins shall be forgeuen them
/ after that they have received their full chastisinge of ye lordis hand for
all their sins. Thou shall be my servant / Esaie xli
I have chosen ye / nether shall I at any time refuse ye* se that thou fear not
/ for I shall be with ye: nether look thou about for any other / for I am thy
God which shall conforte ye / I shall help ye / I shall hold the fast with this
same my faithful righthonde. Behold as many as provoke the to anger / shall be
counfunded and shamed / thy aduersares shall come to naught and peresshe: so
that he that shall seek for them / shall no where find them. Thy enemies which
dare mow battle against the shall be distroyed. For I the lord thy God shall
hold fast thy right hand / which also now say unto the fear not / for it
is I that shall help the / be not afraid my little seruau^te Jacob / fear not
poor dispysed Israel / for I shall help the says the lord / and I that
makes holy Israel shall avenge the / ye I shall trende^ the like a wayne and
like a new shode car^e to thresshe down mountayns and to beat them in poulder
/ and the little hyls shall thou drive into duste / thou shall wenowe them / and
drive them away like the wind / and scater them abroad kyke a whyrle wind /
whiles thou thy silfe shall rejoice greatly in the lord: and praise him that
makes the holy Israel. When the poor afflicte desired ^ater / and find it
not / and their tongue is dry for thyrste: then do I the lord give it them: I
the God of Israel forsake them not. Esaie xlij
I shall led the blind in to a way that they know not: and direct them into
a pathe of which they are ignorant / I shall turn the darkness into light
before them / and the kroke in to an even way / this things will I do for
them / nether will I forsake them.

This speaks the lord which has created the o Jacob: and fasshioned ye o
Israel / Esaie xliij
fear thou not / for I shall redeem ye / I have challenged ye for my own sylfe
/ and given the thy name / that thou should be mine / so that when thou
passedste through the waters I wylbe with the. Remember well these things Jacob
and Israel / Esaie xliii
for thou art my servant whom I have fasshioned to thente^te that thou
should be my servant newer to be out of my mind o Israel I do away thy
wickedness eue^ as I disperse a cloud: and thy sins take I (...) way like a
myste / turn the therefore to ^ for I will deliver the. Esaie li
Lift up you^ eyes to heaven / and behold the earth vnd^ you: for heaven
shall be dispersed like smoke and the earth shall be broken like a garme^ and her
inhabitours shall peresshe in ly^ manner / but my saving health shall endure for
ever / and my mercy wherewith I make men righteous shall newer fail. It is that
conforte you at all times says the lord

Esaie. liiij
I forsook the for a little time / but I called the to me again with much
mercy. (...) hyd my face from the for a little space why^les I was angrye: but I
will take ye (...) my arms again with an everlasting me^^cy: says the lord
thy redemer: for this thing shall be to me as were the waters of n^ he upon the
earth. For like wise as I swore newermoare to bring again the waters of nohe
upon the earth / even so have I sworn to be not angrye with ye again / nether
yet to chyde with the: for ye mountanys shall sooner forsake their places: and
the hills shall sooner fall down / then other my mercy shall forsake ye: or
the promise of my peace shall fail yt / says thy merciful lord. Behold my
little poor afflicte and for^aken: I shall make thy walls of precious
^arboncles: and shall lay thy fundati^n with Saphyrs: thy wyndous and yer^s
shall I make of clear Crystal: and all ^y wttermoste byldinge shall I set
with ^ych stones. And beside all this / all thy ^ilderne shall be taught of the
lord: and ^hal endue them with rich peace / thou shall ^e byldeth all of
righteuesnes / and be out ^f all danger of violence / whereof thou ^hal^ not
neade to fear / no plage shall come ^y^ the and.c. Give ear to me and come to
me: and your souls shall be refresshed / for I wy^l ^myt hondes with you into
an euerla^tinge conuenaunce to give you these assuerd marcyes promised unto
David.

My dear brethern give faith unto their promyses / and let not ye dissaytfull
workinge of satan / make you anys to doubt in the mercifulnes of your heavenly
father / for sooner shall the mountaynis leawe their places / then his mercy
shall be drawyne from you: he has sworn / and has not repented: to show his
aboundante and euerlasti^ge mercy unto you Therefore my welbelowed brethren / be
strong in the faith: and give honor to God: and steadfastly believe ye he
which has made the promyses unto you is able also to make them good. And give
no head to other false prophets that would draw you from god. Math. vij
They are wolves and would deuore you / be not tayne away with the error of
the wicked: But rejoice in the lord always / and again Isaye rejoice /

is able to save you: and all that trusts in him. i. Thimo^. i.

Of peace
PEace comes of faith / nether mo faith be without peace / nor peace
without faith for peace comes of ryghteuesnes (which is of faith) Peace
shall be the end of ryghteuesnes. Esaie xxxij^ Roman. iij Romano. v
An man is justified by faith without the deades of the law. Herefore Paul
concludes. Because therefore that we are justified by faith / we are at peace
with god. etc. This peace whereof I speak is the peace which Christ gave and
left to the apostles and disciples saying. Peace I l^ue with you / Joan. xiiij
my peace I give unto you / no^ as the world gives / give I unto you Let not
your hertes be grieved / nether fear ye. The same peace Paul commended unto
the people (to whom he wrote his epistles) saying Grace be with you: Roma. i i
Cori. i ^. ij Gala. i Esaie xxxij
and peace from God our father / and from the lord Jesus Christ. My people
shall dwell in the fayer house of peace / in sure tabernacles / and in rych beds
/ hayle when it shall descend / it shall fall only upon wodes and ceties. and^.
Christ the prince of peace / Esai^ ix
an king which shall newer have an end: in encressinge his impery / and yet
shall ^e there with noresshe peace. Esaie xlv Esaie lxv^
I am the lord that makes peace This speaks the lord / lo I shallede forth
peace to her like a floude. This peace is an joyful reest and quyetnes in a
faithful ma^nis conscience. The which comes of faith / Joan. i
for faith makes him sure / that his sins are forgeuen him / and that he is
in Gods faueours. Wherefore the dredoure / the trouble and in quyetnes / which
he had before of his sins is away. And he has peace that is to say / an
joyful reest and quyetnes in his conscience. Of the which says Christ. Come
unto me ^e all that labor / Math. xi
and are ^aden / and I will ease you. Take my yoke on ^ou: and learn of me /
for I am meke and ^oly in heart: and ye shall find reest unto you ^e souls The
unfaithful has not this peace for their consciences are troubles with their
sins. Esaie xlviij
As it is written unto the ungodly there is no peace says the lord for they
know not the way of peace / which only is Christ which was wounded for our
transgressions / Psalm. xiij Esaie liij
and smyten for our ungodliness. For the punisshment whereby we have peace was
laid apo^ him. Woe be unto ye unwise prophets (says ye lord god) which
dissaue my people / Ezechie. xiij
preaching / peace / Esaie lvij
peace / and there is no peace. I make peace and sue^nes both with them that
dwell far / and with these that dwell nigh says ye lord / and I have heals
them / but the ungodly are like the wode see called Entipus which can newer
reest: her waters are continually troubled with slyme and stynkynge mudde / and
eue^ so have the ungodly newer reest nor peace says my god. But unto you
belowed brethern Christ has given this peace saying Peace I lewe with you /
Joan. xiiij
my peace I give unto you.

Which peace ye have received (inwardly in your souls) through faith: and
are at peace with god / Roman. v Ephe. ij. Ephe. v
through our lord Jesus Christ which is your peace Therefore brethern rejoice
singing and playinge to the lord in your hertes / gevynge thanks all ways
for all things (in the name of our lord Jesus Christ) to God the father:
submitti^ge your sylfes one to another in the fear of God. And have peace
among your sylfes. And also y fit be possible (yet on your part) have peace
with all men. Roma. xij. ij Cori. xiij. Esaias. xl
And the god of peace shall counforte your hertes in to his eternal promise.
Amen.

Of low
Hear o Israel / Deute. vi.
the lord thy god / is god only. And thou shall low thy god / with all thy
heart / with all thy soul / and with all thy strength. This low comes of
faith / nether mo this low be where faith is not / nor mo faith be (where of I
mean) without this low. For by faith an man is made sure of ye goodness of ye
graciousnes and of the mercyfulnes of God. Wherefore he must neade low him.

Because his excellence / his goodness and kyndnes to ward us deserved low.
Joan. iiij
We should not low god for the deades of low which he has showed unto us.
But we should low god for the goodness: graciousnes / and mercyfulnes of him
sylfe / which is declared unto us by soche gracious and merciful deades
wrought by his godly wysdom for our well. The low and goodness of god is not
made perfect by soche works: for it is and was in him sylfe before the works.
And the works do but show unto us / Romano..i
his nature: and how worthy he is to belowed. Ephe. i.
Helowed us before the fundatio^ of the world was laid. But this low he
show unto us in these last days: by his lowely works. Hereby perceive wethe
low of God / i Joan. iij.
for he gave his life for us. He lowed us ever and prepared an kingdom for us /
Mat. xxv
from the beginning of the world. Ye he lowed us ever / i. Joan. iiij.
for he in his incomprehensible godhed is very low / but this low was
declared openly unto us: by his works which he has wrought to ward us And
not only should we low him be cause he lowed us / but for his own goodness and
mercyfulnes / the which we know in that he received us to his grace which
are unworthy. Faith makes an man sure of the exceeding goodness of god / the
which goodness makes an man ye drawed an man with soche power to the low of
God / that he can not do but low God / for he is so low worthy / that it is
impossible to know him and not to low him. Whereby ye shall know that faith
brings low / and mo not be without it moare no the fire without heeth For
faith brings ye sprite of God as says Paul to the Galathy. Gala. iij
This only would I learn of you / received ye the sprite of God / by the
deades of the law? or else by preaching of the faith? and the sprite of God
which comes of faith brings low as Paul writteth to the Romans. Romano. v
The low that God has unto us: is sheed abrod in our hertes by ye holy ghost
/ Gala. v
which is given unto us. The fruit of the sprite is low So of faith comes
low / nether mo it be without low / faith by low is mighty in operacio^.
How perfect that this low should be in us / almighty God has showed unto us
/ by his law. Deutero. vi
Wherein it is commands us that we low our lord God with all our heart /
with all our soul / and with all our streyngth. The which low no man in
this present life mo fulfill / because of the seed of sin sown in us by
Adam: Romano. iij
which thought it spring not and bear no fruit / yet it remaneth ever ready
to spring / Romano. vi Iacobi. i.
ye and would bear fruit unto the deeth were not the holy sprite subdued it /
and mortyfyed it / Roma. vij
and holds it down I am carnal soulde under sin / because I wot not what
I do. For what I would / that do I n^ but what I hate: that do I. If I do now^
that which I would not / I grant to the lo^we that it is good. So then now
it is not I that do it / but sin that dwells in me. For I know that in me
(that is to say in my flesh) dwells no good thing. To will is present
with me / but I find no m^^anes to perform that which is good. For I do not
that thing which I would / but that evil do I: which I would not. Finally if
I do that I would not / then is not I that do it / but sin that dwells in
me do^eth it. I find then by the law that when I would do good: evil is
present with me. I delight in the law of God / as concerning the inner man /
but I se a another law in my members rebellinge against the law of my mind /
and subduinge me unto the law of sy^ne which is in my members. O wretched man
that I am who shall deliver me from this body of deeth? I thank God by Jesus
Christ our lord / so then I my sylfe in my mind serve the law of God / and
in my flesh the law of sin. Here Paul she^wed the synfulnes of his flesh
/ laudinge God by Jesus Christ / that he was not there unto subdued. Roma. viij
If ye mortyfie the deades of the flesh / by the help of the sprite ye shall
live: for as many as are led by the sprite are the sons of God. Here it is
openly declared: that it is by the powere of the sprite of God / and not by
our deades / that the sin which is in our flesh is mortyfied: subdued:
or dampened. But soche perfection have we not / nor yet mo have that sin
shall be clean taken out of us / so long as we are in this corruptible body.
The flesh lusts (ever) contrary to the sprite. Roman. vi
But yet let not ye sin which is in your mortal bodies regne ye ye should
there unto obey in the lusts of it. Nether give ye your members as
instruments of vnrighteuesnes unto sin: but give your sylfes unto God / as
they that are alive from deeth / and give your members as instruments of
righteuesnes unto God Sin shall not have powere ower you / for ye are not
under ye law / but under grace / Io. i.iij.viij and xx Gala. iij T^um iij
Gala. iiij Roma. vii
and ye are borne a new in ye sprite. The sprite is made fre. Ye sprite is
filled with ye holy ghost And ye sprite fulfilleth the law. In my mind (says
Paul) I serve the law of God / howebeit ye sin dwell in the flesh / yet
the sprite will not consent nor obey there unto because it is borne a new: i
Corin. i.xij ii Corin. iij Roma. viij Gala. v
and made fre by faith / but will obey unto the law of God / by the power of
his holy sprite / by whom spryngeth very low from the heart. And so in the
sprite the law is fulfilled. Tha^ command us to low God. With all our heart
/ i. Corin. xiij
with all our soul / with all our streyngth: out of this low spryngeth all
good works / for low can not be ydel / but must of neade work to the
pleasure of him whom is lowed / when occasion comes An man that has perfect
low to God seeks with all diligence to know they things wherein God has
pleasure. And when he knowed the will of God: Psalm. i
there mo nothing hold him from the doing of it. Ye he is glade that God
has commanded him to do soche things Because his pleasure is to be occupied
in the law of the lord: Math. xi
nether is his law heavy to soche a man. For it is an easy yoke / and an light
burdynge through low / wherein I pray God to co^ferme your hertes by his
sprite through faith. Amen.

Of patience
Jacob iv
BE ye pacient brethren unto the coming of the lord Belowed brethern pacence
is an virtue which is necessary in their evil and peralouse days: Ephesio. v
and thereby all ye sayn^^e^ of God have ouerco^me all persecution and trouble
put om them in this present life / and this patience Paul commended unto us
saying. ij Corint. v^
In all things let us behave our sylfes as the ministers of God in much
patience / in afflictions / in necess^te / in auguy^she in strypes / in
preso^ment / in strife / in labor in warche / in fasting / in pureness / in
knowledge / in long sufferinge / in kyndnes / in the holy ghost / in low
unfeigned / in the words of truth in the power of God / by the arm^^^ of
righteuesnes on the right hand / and on the lift hand / in honor / and
dishonor / in evil report / and good report / as disceauers / and yet true
/ as unknown / and yet known / as deyinge / and behold we yet live / as
chastened and not killed / as sorowynge / and yet always merry / as poor / and
yet make many rich / as having no thing / and yet possessynge all things.
Behold Job
This patience is to soffre and receive gladly without any murmr whatsoever
trouble / pain / vexation / Romano. v
and aduersite that God sent And this patience comes of perfect low which
comes of strong and sure faith This patience teached us the apostle Iamys
saying. Be ye pacient brethren / Iaco. v.
unto the coming of the lord. Patience do mark some trouble / for in
prosperity she lost her ^ome / she ragne never but where trouble and Behold
wicked Iezabel caused to kill all the holy prophets in Israel except they
that were hyd secretly / or fled to the deserte / iij Regu^ xix
as Elias and.c. Of the trouble and persecution of the prophets and servants
of God says Christ to the old scribes and pharisees. Mat. xxiij
Behold I send unto you / prophets wise men / and scribes / and of them some
shall ye kyl and crucify / and some shall ye scourge in your synagogges / and
persecute them from city to city. Take (my brethern) the prophets for an
ensample of sufferinge adversity / Iacobi v
and of long patience which spoke in the name of the lord. Behold we count
them happy which endure. Ye have herd of the patience of Job: and have known
what end the lord made / for the lord is pityfull / Tobie i. and ij
and merciful. Behold also the great adversity and trouble of holy Tobie:
for all his substance was taken from him / and hymsylfe was sought to be killed
/ and his sight was taken from him by God / also ye have herd what endethe
lord made of all his aduersite. God tries he faith of his children
Market his also: if God send the to the sea / and promise to goo with ye /
and to bring the saffe to land / he will reyse up a tempest agenst the / to
prove whether thou will abide by his word / and that thou may feale thy
faith and perceive his goodness / for were it all ways fair wether and ^ou
never brought to soch ieoperdy when^e his mercy only delivered the / thy faith
^ulde be but a presumption and thou shul^est be ever unthankful to God and
mer^ylesse unto thy neyboure

If God promise riches: ye way thereto is ^owerte. Who^ he loweth him he
chasteset / whom he exaltet / he casts down / whom he ^^ueth he da^neth
first. He brings no man ^o heaven except he send him to hell first. If he
promise life he sleyeth first: when he ^yldeth / he casts all down first. He
is no ^atcher / he can not bylde on a another man's foundation. He will not work
until all be past remedy and brought unto soch a case / that men may se how
that his hand / his power / his mercy: his goodness and truth has wrought all
to gether. Esaie xl^
He will let no man be partetaker with him of his praise and glory. His works
are wonderful and contrary unto man's works. The work of God ar^ wonderfu^
Who ever save he delivered his own son / his only son / his dear son
unto the deeth and that for his enemies sake / to win his enemy / to
overcome him with low / that he might se low and low again / and of low to
do like wise to other men / and to overcome them with well doing

Joseph saw ye son and the moon and xi. ster res worshepinge him.
Nevertheless shameful deeth of the cross as a thef or a mortherer. Ye an
cursed deeth as says the law cursed is whosoever hangs on tree. Deuter. xxi
He vas ^ende in the warlde by the father to suffer trouble / which before he
appointed to him. Ye he seet an strong batayl before him in the which he do
fight a^ an worthy knight: Ioann. ^vi
and obtained victory / and have received ye reward / but first he fought / or
he wa^ne the reward / ye he suffered to be sore wounded be fore he obtained
victory. As the holy prophet saw long before hand / and spoke of him. Esaie
liij
He shall have nether beutye nor favor / when we shall behold him he shall be
out of shappe / so that we shall not desyer him / he shall be despised and lest
set bye of al men / a man having experience and fealinge both our sorrows
and sykenesses / we shall (I say) repute him so vile and lothly that we shall
hyde our faces from him. When this (not withstondinge yet) is even he must
bear our sykenesses and sorrows. But we shall judge him to be thus cast down
and smyten with some plage of God / ye when he is wounded even of our
transsgressions: and thus smyten for our ungodliness / for the punishment for
our correction shall be laid upon him: and by his stripes and hurt shall be
healed. All we are strayed away like sheep / every man folouynge his own way
/ but the lord lays all our wykednesses upon him to forgive us. It is he
that shall abide the anguyshe and be scourged: and yet shall he not ons opene his
might / he shall be led like a lamb to be offered up / and he shall be as still as
a sheep under her clyppers hondes / and shall not ons open his lips / he
shall be taken away and put to deeth / his cause not examined after true
judgment: as a man frenlesse and kynlesse. And yet who may noumbre his
kynrede even then when he shall be thought clean to be kut out of this world?
which plage shall fall upon him for the transgressio^ of his own people
Farthermore he shall be thought to dye among the ungodly and be lyfted up on the
cross between thieves: al thought he never did hurt nor yet any desayt found
in his words / but the lord had decreed him to be thus broken with infirmite
that he offered for our sins / might se his long lived prosperity. And
this decree of the lord shall prospere in hand / with the petel of his own
life he shall find riches And by this means my right servant shall iustyfie
many me^ / for he him sylfe shall bear away their sins. Wherefore I shall
divide to him the pray both of the many men: and also of the strong violence
/ because he shall let his life to deeth / and be reputed among the mysdoers /
which not witstondinge / yet shall he take away the sins of many / and make
intercession for the transsgressours. Therefore be lowed brethern follow
manfullye your blessed lord unto the batayl: seeing him fight as your
strong captain before you / and his baner blowynge on bredht. Trow ye to
receive the reward but if ye suffer? or trow ye to obtain victory but if ye
put your sylfe in ieopardye? no verily. Be not therefore deceived (my brethern)
with flesshlye lusts / but stand up and put on the armure of God that ye
may be able to resist in the evil day / and to sto^de perfect in all things.
Ephesio. vi
Stand therefore and your loins gyrd about with verity / having on the
breast plate of righteuesnes / and shood with shows prepared by the gospel of
peace. Above all take to you the shield of faith / wherewith ye may quench all
the fyrye darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of health and the swearde
of the sprite / and rynne vnfeardlye to the batayl that is set before you / and
put your sylfe in to prese following your master. Care not thought ye be
wounded / for deeth shall have no power ower you / and of your wounds ye
shall be made hole: by your own most noble phisitiane Jesus Christ. Mat. ix
Herefore murmr not thought the batayl be strong / for your master had the
greatest burden of it. Psalm. lxvij
By whois help ye shall sone have victory: when your enemies shall be subdued:
and ye shall regne eternaly in glory with Jesus Christ. Hebreo. ^
Belowed brethern despyce not so great health / for a little and short
trouble^ but suffer and ye shall regne. Look unto Jesus: Hebreo. xij
the auctor and fynnyssher of your faith / which for the Joy that was set
before him: abode the cross / and despised the shame and is set down at the
right hand of the troune of God. Consider therefore how that he endured soche
speakinge against him of sinners / lest ye should be weried and faynte in your
minds. For ye have not yet (all) resisted unto the blood shed dynge. etc.
Ioann. xv. Ephesio. i Zacha. ix Roma. viij
Prefere not your sylfes above your master and lord / ye your heed / and
your king. Desire not to be spared seeing that God spared not his only
begotten son / but gave him for us all. If ye be sons and children with
Christ / Hebreo. xij
suffrethe chastisinge of your heavenly father (with Christ) for and ye be not
under chastisinge / whereof al are partetakers* then are ye bastardes and not
sons nor children / cast not the cross from you / which Christ and all the
saynctes has borne. Behold the heavy cross that God laid on the shulders of
his welbelowed apostles / as Christ before or they suffered showed unto them

Joan. xx. Joan. xv Mat. x
As my father sent me: so send I you. If the persecute me / then shall they
persecute you I send you forth as sheep among wolue The sheep fight not / but
the sheparde fyghteth for them and cares for them. Be harmeles as doves
therefore (says Christ) and wise as serpe^tes. The wisdom of the serpente
The doves ymagen no defense nor seek to avenge them silfes The serpe^tes
wisdom is to keep his heed and those parts wherein his life rests. Christ is
our heed: and Gods word is that wherein our life rests. To cleue therefore
fast unto Christ and unto those promyses which God has made us / for his sake
is our wisdom. Let us therefore look diligently where unto we are called /
that we disceaue not our silfes. Roman. vi
We are called to dye with Christ: yt we may live with him: and to suffer with
him that we may regne with him. We are called unto a kingdom / that must be
won with sufferinge only / as a seek man wins health. God is he that does
all thing for us and fyghteth for us / and we do but only suffer. Beware of
men (says Christ) for they shall deliver you up unto their counsels / Math. x.
and shall scourge you. And ye shall be brought before rulars and kings for my
sake. The brother shall betraye or deliver the brother to deeth / and the
father the son. And the childerne shall rise agenst father and mother / and
put them to deeth / and ye shall be hated of all men / for my name / but
whosoever shall continue unto the end / shall be saved. When they persecute you
in won city / fly into an other. The disciple is not above his master / nor
the servant above his lord. It is ynought for the disciple to be as his
master is / and that the servant be as his lord is. If they have called the
master of ye housse Beelzebub / how much moare shall they call them of his
houssholde so? fear them not therefore. Luce xiiij
Which of you disposed to bylde a toure (says Christ) sits not down first
and counts the cost wheter he have sufficient to perform it? lest when he
has laid the foundation and then not able to perform it / all that behold
begin to mock him saying. This man began to bylde: and was not able to
make an end. So like wise none of you that for saketh not all that he has
can be my disciple. Whosoever therefore casts not this before hand. I must
ieopardy life: goods honor / whorsepe and all that there is for Christ's sake
disceaueth him sylfe and makes a mock of him sylfe unto the godless
ypocrites and infidels. No mane can serve two masters / God and mammon / Mathei
vi.
that is to say weked riches also. Thou must low Christ above all thing but
that does^ is not slokned / but they abyd for their pray wa^thynge as
raweninge wolves / if they mo se any of Christ's poor sheep to devour Belowed
brethern be strong in the lord / and fear them not which can do unto you
no harm but kill the body: Math. x
where unto ye are appointed of God (if it so come to pass) as it is written For
thy sake are we killed all day long: Psalm. xliij
and are counted as sheep appointed to be slain. Tribulation is our right
baptim / and is signified by plunginge in to ye water / we that are baptized in
ye name of Christ (says Paul) are baptized to dye with him. Roma. vi
The sprite through tribulacion purges us and kylleth our flesshly wit:
our wordly understanding and belly wisdom / and fylleth us full of the
wisdom of God. Tribulacion is a blessinge that comes of God / Tribulation i^
a blessige Math. v
as Christ witneseth. Blessed are ^hey that suffer persecution for
righteuesness is sake: for theyrs is the kingdom of heaven. Is not this a
confortable word? who ought not rather to chose and desire to be blessed with
Christ in a little tribulation then do be cursed perpetually with the world for
a little pleasure? Prosperity is^ a curse Lu^^ vi
prosperity is a right curse and a thing that God gives unto his enemies. Woo
be to you rich says Christ Lo ye have here your co^solatio^: woo be to you yt
are full: for ye shall ho^gre / woo be to you that laugh / for ye shall weep /
woo be to you when men praise you. For so did their fathers unto the false
prophets / ye and so have our fathers done unto the false ypocrites. The
ypocrites with worldly preaching have not gotten the praise only / but even the
possessions also and the domination and rule of the hole world. Tribulation
for righteuesnes is ye gift of god Actor.v ij Thimo. iij Philippe. i
Tribulacio^ for righteousness is not a blessinge only / but also a gift that
God gives unto none save his special friends* The apostles reioysed that they
were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for Christ's sake. And Paul says. All
that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution. And in a another
place unto you it is given not only to believe in Christ / but also to suffer
for his sake. And Peter says Happy are ye / i Petri iiij
if ye suffer for the name of Christ / for the glorious sprite of God rests
in you. Is it not an happy thing to be sure yt thou art sealed with gods
sprite unto the everlasting life? and verily thou art sure thereof / if thou
suffer patiently for his sake. By suffrynge art thou sure. Whereby the^ are
your tyrannes sure? Romano. v ij Corint. xij
But by per persecutinge can thou never besure. For Paul says. Tribulation
makes fealinge / that is / it makes us feale the goodness of God and his help
and the workynge of his sprite. And in another place he says. The lord said
unto him / my grace is sufficient for ye / for my strength is made perfect
through weakness. Lo Christ is never strong in us / till we be weak. As our
strength abateth / so groueth the strength of Christ in us. When we are clean
empted of our own strength / then are we full of Christ's strength. And look
how much of our strength remains in us / so much lacks there of the
strength of Christ. Therefore says Paul in the same place. Very gladly will I
rejoice in my weakness / that the strength of Christ may dwell in me

Therefore have I delectation says he inmy infirmites / in rebukes / in neade /
in persecutions / and in anguisshe for Christ's sake. For when I am weak /
then am I strong / meaning that ye weakness of ye flesh is the the
strength of the sprite. And by flesh understand wit wisdom / and all that
is in a man before the sprite of God come / and whatsoever spryngeth not of the
sprite of God / and of Gods word. And of like testimonies is all the scripture
full*

Behold God sets before us a blessinge and also a curse. A blessinge verily
and that a glorious and a everlasting* if we will suffer tribulation and
aduersite with our lord and saueoure Christ. And an everlasting curse / if
for a little pleasures sake we with draw our sylfes from the chastisinge and
murtoure of God / wherewith he teachet all his sons and faschioneth the^ after
his godly will and makes them perfect (as he did Christ) and makes them apt
and mete wessels to receive his grace and his sprite / that they might perceive
and feale the exceadinge mercy which we have in Christ / and the innumerable
blessings / and the unspeakable enheritaunce where unto wear called and
chose^ and sealed in our saueoure Jesus Christ unto whom be praise for ever.
Amen

Finally whom God choseth to regne euerlastyngly with Christ / him seals he
with his mighty sprite / and powers strength into his heart to suffer
afflictions also with Christ for beri^ge of vit^es unto ye truth. The
difference between ye childerne of God and of the devil Deute. viij
And this is ye difference between the childerne of God and salvation / and
between the childerne of the devil and of damnation / that the childerne of God
have power in their hertes to suffer for Gods word which is their life and
salvation / their hope and trust / and whereby they live in the soul before God

And the childerne of the devil in time of aduersite do fly from Christ.
Joan.vi
Whom they followed faynedly / their hertes not sealed with his holy and myghtie
sprite / and get them to the stondert of their right father the devil /
Joan.viij
and take his wages / the pleasures of this world / which are ernest of
everlasting damnation. As ye read in many places of the holy scripture. i.
Corin. ix.
The which are written for our learning

Mat. xix.
Jesus said / unto his disciples. Verily I say unto you / a rich man shall
with difficulte enter into the kingdom of heaven. And moreover I say unto you /
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a nedle then for a rich man
to enter in to the kingdom of heaven

Luce. xij.
The lands of a certain man brought forth fruits plenteously: and he thought
in him sylfe saying / what shall I do: because I have no room where to
bestow my fruits? and he said. This will I do. I will destroy my barnes /
and bilde greater and there in will I gadder all my fruits / and all my goods /
and I will say to my soul. Soul thou haste much goods laid up in stoore
for many years / take thine ease / eat / drink / and be my merry. But God
said unto him. Thou fool / this night will they fetch away thy soul again
from the. Then whose shall thoose things be which thou have ^rouided? So is it
with him that gaddreth riches / and is not rich in God

There was a certain rich man / which was cloethin purpure / and fine raines
/ Luce. xvi
and fared deliciously every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
/ which lay at his gate full of soores desiringe to be refresshed with the
cromes which fell from the rich man's board / but there was no man that gave
him ought. Nevertheless / ye dogs came / and licked his soores. And it
fortuned that the beggar dyed / and was carried by the angels into Abraham's
bosom. The rich man also dyed / and was buried in hell

When he lift up his eyes / as he was in torments / he saw Abraham a far
of: and Lazarus in his bosom / and cried / and says / have mercy on me / and
send Lazarus that he may deep the rippe of his finger in water / and cole my
tongue / for I am tourmented in this flame. Abraham says unto him. Son
remember: that thou in thy life time receauedst thy pleasure / and contrary
wise Lazarus pain. Now therefore is he conforted: and thowe art punisshed.
and.c.

For as much then as we must neades be baptized in tribulations / and goo
through the red see / and a great and fearful wilderness: Hebreo. xiij
and a land of cruel ge^untes into our own contree / for here have we no
contynuinge city / but we seek ^ city to come / ye and in as much as it is
of plain ernest there is no another way into ye kingdom of heaven / Which way
goo your persecuters to heaven the^ Mathei vij
then through persecution and sufferinge of pain and very deeth: after the
ensample of Christ. For we ^ustenter in at ye strayte gate* for wide is the
gate: and broad is the way that leads to destruction / and many there be
which goo in there at. For strayte is the gat: and narawe is the way which
leydeth unto life / and feawe there be that find it

Therefore let us arm our souls with the conforte of the scriptures / how
that God is ever ready at hand in time of neade to help us. And how that
soch tyrauntes and persecuters are but Gods scourge and his rod to chastise
us. And as the father has always in time of correction the rod fast in his
hand / Your persecuters have no power to do unto you what they would
so that the rod does no thing but as he moweth it / even so has God all
tyrauntes in his hand / and lets them not do whatsoever they would / but
as much only as he apoynteth them to do and as for forth as it is necessa^y for
us. And as when the child submit^eth him sylfe unto his fathers correction /
and nurtoure and humbles him sylfe all to gether unto the will of his father:
then ^he rod is taken away / even so when we are come unto the knowleage of
the right way and have forsaken our own will and offer our sylfes clean
unto the will of God to walk which way so ever he will have us / then turns
he the tyrauntes. Or else if they enforce to persecute us any forther: he
puts them out of the way according unto the confortable ensamples of the
holy scripture

Moareouer let us arm our souls: with the promyses both of help and
assistence: and also of the glorious reward that follows. Mat. v Mat. x
Great is your reward in heaven says Christ. And he that knowledge me before
men / him shall I knowledge before my father that is in heaven. Psalm. xlix
And call on me in time of tribulation: Psalm. xxxij.
and I shall deliver ye And behold the eyes of the lord are ^uer them that
fear him / and over them that trust in his mercy. To deliver their souls from
deeth / and to feed them in the time of hongre

Psalm. xxxiij.
And David says. The lord is nigh the^ that are troubled in their hertes / and
the m^ke in sprite he will save. The tribulation of the righteous are many /
and out o^ them all will the lord deliver them. The lord keeps all the bones
of them / so tha^ not one of them shall be brosed. The lor^de shall redeem / the
souls of his servants. And of soch like consolation are the psames full /
the lord open your hertes / to read them and understand them perfectly in
the sprite. Mat. x
When ye deliver you take no tho^ught what ye shall say. It shall be given you
the same hour what ye shall say. For it is not ye that shall speak / but the
sprite of you^re father speaks in you. The very hears of your heedes are
noumbred. If God care for our hears / he much moare cares for our souls
which he has sealed with his holy sprite. i Petri v
Therefore says Peter. Cast al you^re care upon him / for he cares for you /
and Paul says. God is true he will not suffer you to be tempted above your
myght^ Psalm. liiij A Christen man's care
Cast thy care upon the lord. Let thy care be to prepare thy sylfe with all
thy strength to wal^ke which way he will have the / and to believe that he will
goo with the / and assiste the and strength the agenst all tyrannes and deliver
the out of all trib^lation. But what way or by what means he will do it /
that commit unto him and to his godly plea^ure and wisdom and cast that care
upon him. And thougth it seem never so unlikely or never so impossible unto
natural reason yet believe steadfastly that he will do it. And ^hen shall he
according unto his old use / change the course of the world / even in the
^winkelinge of an eye / and come suddenly upon your tyranntes and mighty
geauntes as a thief in the night / and compass them in their wiles and
worldly wisdom: when they cry piece and all is saffe / then shall their sorrows
begin / as the sorrows of a woman that traueleth with child. And then shall
he dystroye them / and deliver you / unto the glorious praise of his mercy and
truth. Amen

And as perteyninge unto them that despice Gods word: The despicers
persecuters and they that fall from Gods word ar^^h^^a^ead
countinge it as a phantasy or a dream / and to them also that for fear of a
little persecutio fly from it setthes before thy eyes. How God sens the
beginnynge of the world before a general plage: ever se^te his true prophets
and preachers of his word / to warn the people / and gave them space to
repent. But they for the greatest part of them hardened their hertes and
persecuted the word that was sent unto them And then God destroyed them
utterly and took them clean from the earth. As thou seist what followed the
preaching of Noe in the old world / Noe Lot Moses Aaron
what followed the preachinge of Lot among the Sodomites / and the preachinge
of Moses: and Aaron among the Egiptians / and that suddenly agenst all
possibilite of man's wit. Moareouer as often as the childerne of Israel fell
from God to the whorsepinge of images / he sent his prophets unto them. And
they persecuted and waxed hard herted. The prophets
And then he sent them into all places of the world captive. Cast of all he
sent his own son unto them. Christ
And they waxed moare hard herted then ever before. And se what a fearful
ensample of his wrath and cruel vengeance he has made of them unto all the
world now almost fyftene hundred years

Mark also how Christ threathnet them that forsake him for whatsoever cause
it be Whether for fear: either for shame / either for lousse of honor /
friends / life or goods? Mat. x
he that deniet me before men (says he) him will I deny before my father that
is in heaven / he that loweth father or mother moare then me / Marci viij
is not worthy of me. Whosoever is asshamed of me (says he) or of my words
among this adoutours and sinful generation / of him shall the son of ^an
be asshamed when he comes in the ^lorie of his father with his holy Angels.
Luc. ix
Also none that lays his hand to the plowe and looks back / is mere for
the kingdom of heaven

Nevertheless yet if any man have resisted ignorauntly / as did Paul /
Thimoth. i God receaueth them that come again
let him look unto the truth which Paul wrate after he come to knouledge. Also
if any man clean agenst his heart: but overcome with the weakness of the flesh
for fear of persecution: have denied as did Peter / or have delivered his book
to the tyrauntes or put it away secretlye

Let him (if he repent) come again and take better hold and not dispare or
take it for a sign that God has forsaken him. Why lets god his chose^
childerne fall?
For God often times takes his strength eue^ from his very elect: when they
other trust in their own strength or are negligente to call to him for his
strength. And that does he to reach them and to make them feale that in the
fire of tribulation for his words sake no thing can endure and abide /
false his word and that strength only which he has premysed. For which
strength he will have us to pray unto him night and day with all instaunce

Ephesi. iij
Which also is able to do exceeding abounda^tly / above all that ye are or
think: according to ye power that works in us unto whom be praise in the
congregation by Jesus Christ / through out all generation for ever. Amen

Of the mortification of the flesh
Roma. v
BY one man sin entered in the world / and deeth by the means of sin: and
so deeth went over all men / in so much that all men sinned. Dearly beloweth
brethren it is not unknown to you / the ser^^tute the bondage / and the
^hialdom where under we were some time to sin. Ye were ons the servants of
sin. Roma. vi Ephesians. v
Ye were one darkness. But through the great mercy of almighty God we are
delivered there from / by his son Jesus Christ. Romans vi.
So that we are delivered from sin / and made the servants of righteuesnes:
Ephe. ij
but not so perfitly that there is no s^nne in us. We are delivered through faith
/ from the wrath of God / and from the vengeance and curse of the law / and
from the eternal deeth / Roman. iiij Psalm. xxxi
and we have obtained forgyui^g of all our sins / so that they shall not be
imputes to us on that day when the lord shall come. And in the sprite we are
made perfect / and borne a new unto God / Joan. i Roma. viij
so that we are no servants / but sons / and daughters. But yet in our
flesh / there is some sin / ye an wicked seed is sown in our flesh:
and is so roted / that it may not be cleanly taken away in this present life.
i Joan. i
Of the which says Ihon. If we shall say that we have no sin / we deceive
our sylfes / and the truth is not in us. Jacob iij Luce xvij
For in many things we sin all. When we have done all they things which are
commanded unto us / we are yet unprofitable servants / we have done but that
which was our duty to do. This sin: is this concupiscence / this lust / and
evil desire which we have in us contraryous to the law of God And this
concupiscence is verily sin / because it is forbidden in the law of God /
Exodus xx
which says thou shall not concupisce or desire. And be cause it is
contraryous to God and to his pleasure and will / for there may no thing be
contraryous to God / but evil and synneful thing / and this concupiscence or
evil desire / Gala. ^
thought it be evil and sinful / yet we may not awoyde it: so long we are
here in the flesh. For (as says Paul) the flesh lusts contrary to the
sprite / and the sprite contrary to the flesh Their ar contrary one to the
other / so that (...) can not do that what ye would. This b^tayl is even in
an righteous and justified man which has the sprite of God. For the flesh
lusts continualy agenst the sprite (...) that an may not do that which he
wold^ that is / that he mygh^ holely and perf^ue him to the service of God but
he may^ not: for the flesh lusts contrary to the spr^te / and will not nor
can not be obedien^ to the law / Roman: vij.
of this same says Paul. The la^we is spiritual / but I am carnal sold
under sin / because I wo^e not what I do Here Pa. knowledgeth him sylfe: to
hau^ an carnal concupiscence or desire in him and thereby knowledgeth him
subdued to sin. For he says. I am carnal sold under sin. The law he
says also is holy and good / ye ye law is spiritual: but I am ca^nall /
sold under sin. And when Ier^me my sylfe / to do and fulfill / that holy and
spiritual law / I find in me an contrariousnes to it / and may not fulfill
it. Whereby I know that I am carnal and ^^ld^ (that is) subdued under sin /
for in the fl^she he served the law of sin. In my flesh says he I serve
the law of sin. B^ thought he was subdued to the law of sy^ne in the flesh
/ yet he was fre in the sprite. I serve the law of God (says he) in the
sprite. And in the sprite he fought continualy agenst the sin in the flesh /
and would always have had it away. And because he (...) no means culde get
it away he co^playneth saying / what I would that do I not / but what I hat
that do I. As he would say. I would the flesh lusts not agenst the sprite.
And this concupiscence I ^at because it is evil: and yet I may not be fre
from it. The^ it follows. If I do that which I would not / I confess to the
law that it is good. So then now it is not I that do it / but sin that
dwells in me. As he would say. If sin to the which I consent not in the
sprite (but hattes and would have it away) abides in the flesh: ye works
and lusts agenst the law. And I in the sprite consent to the law / and
grants is good / and would fulfill it / and have away that sin out of the
flesh which is contrarious to the law / thought I may not get it away: yet
I sin not / nor transsgresses not the law in the sprite / but the sin that
dwells in the flesh does it

Then it follows. To will is present with me / but I can find no means to
perform that which is good

That is to say. I would this evil lust / and sin in the flesh were away:
so that then were no thing in me contrarious to the holy law of God / but I
can not get it away: I hat it and yet it abides fast rote^ in the flesh. It
follows. I find then by the law: that when I would do good / evil is present
with me. Here Paul showed that ye law gave him knouledge of sin for he had
not known that this lust or concupiscence had been sin / except the law
had said: thou shall not lust / or concupisce / (...) desire. Therefore he says
I find by the law: that evil. that is to say / sin is present with me /
not in the sprite / but in the flesh. Then it follows. I delight in the law
of God / as concerning the inner man / but I se another law in my members
rebellinge agenst the law of my mind: and subduinge me unto tie law of sin
which is in my members. Not that this law of sin in his members over come
him / that he was in the sprite subdued unto it. But it subdued him to sin /
because it made him in danger of the law / for it requires the hole man with
his strength and power. Deutero. vi
And because there was an evil lust and concupiscence in him contrarious unto
the law / therefore he was subdued to sin / not in the sprite but through
sin in the flesh. Now Paul saying this sin sown and fast roted in his
flesh / that it was impossible to get it clean away in this life / he
longs and murneth for the delyueraunce of the synnefull flesh / saying. O
wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of deeth? the^ it
follows I thank God by Jesus Christ our lord. As he would say: thought I
would deliver my sylfe from sin / I may not: and no other man may deliver
me from sin / for they are all in the same bondage and thrall with me so many
as are yet in the flesh. Psalm. xiij
There is none righteous / no not one / there is none that vndersto^deth / there
is none that seeks after God / they are all gone out of the way. They are all
made unprofitable / there is none that d^eth good no not one. Their throat is
an open sepulcher / with they^ tounges they have disceaued: the poison of aspes
is under their lips. Whose mouths are full of chursinge and bitterness. Their
fete are swifte to sheed blood. Destruction and wretchedness are in their ways
/ and the way of peace have they not known: there is no fear of God before
their eyes. But thou alone o lord God / and father which art the weak man's
strenght / and refuge / ready at the hand of him that is in strese / art my
delyueroure. For thou shall deliver me of this presonment of sin / and body of
deeth / by thy wellbelowed son Jesus Christ / our lord. And thought for an
time I must neade suffer / or I receive the final end of my deliverance /
ye^ by hope I a^ sure of it. For thou art true in all thy saye^ges. And thy
truth is sure to all age for ever. And thought in the flesh be some sin /
yet in the sprite I shall consent to the law / and serve it. Belowed brethern
/ though there be in us some sin / and evil lust / and concupiscence / yet
let us not consent to it in the sprite. But resist to it / and fight agenst it
/ serving the law of God in the sprite. As did Paul. Roman. vij
And as he reached us saying. Let not sin regne in your mortal bodies:
that ve should there unto obey in the lusts of it / Roma. xiij
make not provision for the flesh / to fulfill the lusts of it. Walk in the
sprite / and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. If ye live after the flesh
/ Gala. v
ye must dye: So thought we have sin in the flesh / our sprite is fre of it
/ but not through our sylfes / but through the holy ghost

ij. Corint. iij Ioann. viij
Where the sprite of the lord is / there is liberty. And Christ said to the
Jews. If the son shall make you fre / then are ye fre in dead. The son
works by the holy ghost. So does the father also. And their workynge is
indivisible

Joan: v
For that which the father does / the son does / and like wise the holy
ghost. So when the holy ghost makes us fre / the son makes us fre. And when
the father / and the son makes us fre / the holy ghost makes us fre. And
though one of the iij. persons of the holy trinite be named in any place of
the scripture / yet it shall be understand after the indivisible workinge of the
holy trinite / having some works after our manner of speakinge / appropriet
to euerych person These fredome that we have (as says Paul) we have it
through the sprite of the lord and not be our sylfes. For God has sent his
sprite in our hertes / whereby we are louseth in the sprite from the bonds of
sin / and delivered out of seruitute / and cries to God Abba father. Roman.
viij
Now saying that we are made fre in the sprite from sin / let us not tangle
our sylfes again in subjection thereto / but fight agenst it / resist to it /
and with all diligence labor to dante and tayme the wantannes of it / to hold
it down and mortify it as it is written. If ye the^ be risen again with
Christ / seek they things which are above / where Christ sits at the right
hand of God. Set your affection / on things that are above / and not on
things which are on the earth. For ye are deed: Collossen. iij
and your life is hyd with Christ in God When Christ which is your life shall
shew^ him sylfe / then shall ye also apere with him in glory / mortify therefore
your members which are on ye earth. and.c. And in another place it is written.
Gala. v
They yt are Christ's / have crucified the flesh with the appetites and
lusts. Not that we may mortify the fleche / through our own strength / and
labors / as preach the false preachers. No: no but by the holy sprite / as it
is written. Roma. viij
If ye mortyfie the deades of the flesh / by the help of the sprite / ye
shall live. And of what sprite he speaks: he showed immediately after saying.
As many as are led by the sprite of God / are the sons of God. This
mortyfication and crucifienge of the flesh and sin / is an subjection where
under sin is ^ut / not that it is taken clean away / but subdued / holden
down: and not suffered to work. An thing when it sca^es workynge / it is
called deed. An^ tree when it springs not: and bears no fruit nor branches
/ it is called deed. So sin when it works not / and showed not the sylfe /
by works / it is called deed: so we shall make sin to dye and we should
crucify it / not sufferinge it to work. And this we may not do of our
sylfes / but by the holy sprite which regneth in our hertes: and of his power
mortyfies and crucifies this sin which rests in the flesh. He strenghteth
us / for in to the inner man he makes us able and strong to resist to all the
assautes of our enemies He eyketh our power / and minishet they^s He makes
us fre / and subdued them. He gives us life / and killed them. The flesh and
sin (as is said) is mortifieth by the sprite of God / but to the same
mortification our works are required / but our ablenes comes of God. Not
that we may do any good of our sylfes. ij Corint. i^
No we are not sufficient of our sylfes / to think any thing as it were of
our sylfes / but our ablenes (there to) comes of God / by his holy sprite.
Philippe. i^
For it is God that works in us / both the will and also the dead / ye eue^
of his own good will. He works in us / the works which are necessary to the
mortification of the flesh / ye he makes us to chastifie the body and bring
it into subjection / by resistinge unto the lusts of it / and continual
excertion of good works. For the moare that an man be uses to sin / the
harder shall it be to resist unto the evil use and lusts thereof. For the
lusts of sin / are ever the stronger / the moare that an man follow them be
an evil use. And by the contrary / the resistinge of sin and excercition of
good works takes some thing away of the strength of sin. i Thimo. ii^
Herefore brethern exerce your sylfes unto Verily I say unto you / they have
received their reward. But when ye fast anoynte your heed: and wash your
face / that it apere not unto men how ye fast / but unto your father which
is in secret. and.c.

Herefore brethren in all things keep measure be discrete / follow the sprite
/ and mortyfie the flesh / by the holy ghost whom ye have received / as the
ernest of your enheretaunce / by whom ye are teached in all truth / and as he
has teached you abide therein. i Joan. ij Hebreo. xiij
And be not carried hidder / and thydder / with diverse and strange learning.

(I say the learning of men which the holy scripture do not know) as ye
have been in time passed. Wherewith ye were drawene from the faith and gave head
unto sprites of error / and deuylshe doctrine of them which speak lies
through ypocrisy / and have their consciences marked with an hett yerne
forbiddynge to mary / and co^maundynge to absteyne from meats / which God
has created to be received with geuynge of thanks of them which believe: and
have known the truth. For all the creatures of God are good: and no thing to
be refused / if it be received with geuynge of thanks. For it is sanctified by
the word of God and prayer. If thou shall put the brethren in remembrance of
these things (says Paul to Thimothe) thou shall be a good minister of Jesus
Christ which have been norished up in the words of faith / and good
doctrine / which thou have continualy followed: but cast away vngostly and
old wives fables

This I say lest any man should begylle you with entysinge words. For though
I be absent in the flesh: yet am I present with you in the sprite ioyinge and
beholdinge your steadfast faith in Christ. As ye have therefore received Christ
Jesus the lord: eue^ so walk ro^ed and bilt in him / and steadfast in the
faith / as ye have learned / and therein be plenteous in geuinge thanks

Beware lest any man come and spoil you through philosophy and disceatful
vanity / through the tradicions of men / and ordinacio^s after the world and
not after Christ. For in him duelled all the fulness of the go^ heeth boddyly /
and ye are full in him / which is the heed of all rule and power / in whom also
ye are circumcised with circumcision made without hondes by puttinge of of the
sinful body of the flesh / through the circumcision that is in Christ. In that
ye are buried with him through baptim / in whom ye are also risen again
through faith / that is wroght by the operation of God which raised him from
deeth

And has with him quickened you also which were deed in sin and in the
vncircumcisio^ of your flesh / and has forgiven us our trespases: and has
put out the obligation that was against us / made in the law written / and
that has he taken out of the way: and has fastenet it on his cross and has
spoiled rule and power / and has made ashewe of them openly / and has
triumphed over them in his own person

Let no man therefore trouble your co^ciences about meat and drink: or for
a peace of an holy day / which are no thing but shadows of things to come /
but the body is in Christ. Let no man make you to shute at a wrong mark /
which after his own ymaginacion walks in the humblenes and holiness of angels
/ things which he never saw / causlesse puffed up with his fleshly mind /
and holds not the heed / whereof all the body by joints and couples receaueth
norishment: and is knet to gedder and increases with the increasynge that
comes of God

Wherefore sen ye are deed with Christ from the doctrine of the world: why as
thought ye yet lived in the world / should ye be yet led with tradicions of
them that say touch not / taste not / handle not. and.c. Now in co^clusio^ be
ye all of one mind and the God of peace / that raised from deeth our lord
Jesus Christ: i Corin. xiiij Joan x
the great sheperde of you his sheep / through the blood of the everlasting
testament / make you perfect in all good works / to do his godly and holy will
/ and bring to pass that whatsoever ye do may be accepted in his fight / by
the means of Jesus Christ. To whom be praise for ever. Amen

I beseech you brethren / suffer the words of exhortation: for I have written
unto you in feawe words. Salute all the saynctes / they which are here salute
you in the lord. Grace be with you all. Amen
