Diuit Dominus: cuins inuicta veritas manet ineternum*

AFtir that it had plesed our most merciful father in heaven of his inestimable
goodness to restore us his gospel and to bring agene his holy word into this
realm of england by a few pore persecuted and banesshed men for the trwthe
of goddis word tra^slatinge the scripture and making certain other english
bokis in the nether and over parties of Germanye: which bokis / inagry Mous
tethe / all his papisticall Synagoge resistinge / yet were they brought in and
distributed in this land. Then begane the Sinagoge of Satan to rore and
resist with fire and water / with presonment and persecucion / so grevousely /
so cruely / as never before was seen in the land / al manner cruel kind of
torme^tinge obtained of the secular power co^tiniving now this. x. year: but
most mercylesly and subtyly those two year and more / while More was More was
chaunceler quo^ dam
chaunceler: which god for his mercy cease when his will is. Then (I say) in
the days of that gloriouse Cardinal Thomas wolsaye begane these wyked
pharisays to suborne and set thez for the M. More their pro^-toure and patron
to write and wrestle for thez agenst the truth agenst the lord and his
anointed to defend their anticristen finago ge: More then being a full fer
kouer for fiche a cup to furnessh it with lies to clook and kouer their wyked
mischief with subtyle falsehed / and to mayntayn their gloriouse ^n godlynes
with his autorite / for the Cardinal deed he succeeded him in the chaunceler
ship. Which foxisshe ypocryte when he sa we the almighty word of god so
openly la yd forth in english yt every lay man might se the verite and the
way to his salvation tho row Cristis blood \ would he have suffered thez to
have red it: And age^ / when this cruel pharisaye considered that this vehement
mighty breathe of the mouth of god was like to blow down anticristis
kingdom now in reeling and ready to fall: which he had either for money or for
the honor of his lor de the Cardinal / then taken upon himself properly to
underprop: begane first like one of those blind bylders his p^discessours
remembered in the psalm (which reproved rejected yt head kornerd stone Criste
whic^e Psalm. c. x viij
closed up and made perfect al ye hole work of the law and prophetis eue^ ye
perfayt end and fulness of all / in whom our sufficit^ saluacipn ^om. x Ephesians. 1.
Col. 1. ij
consists) Where he saw that the scripture would not frame with his
deuelysshe deuyce / he began (I say) to shove un der this his shameless
shore. That y^ apostels left many thingis vnwryte^ which ar of necessite to be
believed. Which vnwrite^ verites (as he calls thez) thapostles dely uered by
mouth to their successors / and these so from hand to hand until they came
to Moris church / that is to say / unto More himself / y^ popes / cardinallis
/ bishopes / preistis / monkis and fiyers etc^. and eue^ at last unto the holy
maid of kent Moris miracle maker / which now having the ho ly ghost (as More
says) assistent / cannot er re. For criste so promised it thez unto the
worldis end / says he. Now is Moris chir che bylded and thus underpropped lo
that it cannot err re^le / nor never fall. If More therefore teache us (as he
does in deed) that our sufficient savior Criste one a lone for vsall enough
/ is but a quarter savior or a savior to halues: for that we must brin ge with
us the popis faith / some of our merits satisfaccions / sayntismeritis / popis
pardons pilgrimagis / burying in an obserua^tis lowly gra^e cote with syche
infinite pollin ge pyl^t^e to deserve us heaven: yet must we be leave it. And
why? because More and his chir che so teache us / and Moris church cannot err.
If he teache us: That to pray to / and to call upon god only in all our
affliccion and tri vulatio^ for health and salvation is not sufficient: but that
we must runto / and calvpon deed and toten postis / or rather as they color
this idolatrye / pray through thez to the sayutis in heaven represented by fiche
idols as their selves ever aborted / which saintis also now nether know us nor
here us* but if they knew under what ungodly manner we abuse Isaie. lxiij.
thez into the injury of Crystis glory / they would aborte us: if (I say)
More teache us this idolatry / yet must we believe it: for Mo ris church cannot
err. If he teache us: That god only through the merits of crystisdeth by his
holy ghost is not the geuer of all grace salvation and goodness: but that we must
receive these giftis and grace of other creatu res of their own charminge: yet
must we believe thez: for Moris church cannot err. If More teache us that the
testament wryte^ incrystis blood and confirmed with his death and miracles / is
not yet so perfect and ratifyed as sufficient for our salvation: but yt it
wants certain vnwrite^ verites of More his own fayning with out which we
cannot be saved yet must we believe him: for Moris church cannot err. etc. O
miserable religion and wretched church that cannot be defended but with fiche
lies false miracles feigned re uelacions and so pestelent doctrine. O Satanical
synago ge which cannest not be mayn tayned and supported but by tyra^nye /
persecu cio^ / impresonme^t / murder / cruel burning and sheding of innocent
blood. O wiked wry ter / which can not confirm and fortifye thy false
faith and falser doctrine / unless (the wr yte^ word of god forsaken / orels
perniciously perverted) thou beist constrained to fle unto they nowne unwryte^
deed dremes / haithe^ rytes / iewisshe ceremonies even anticristis own
tradicions.

But christian reder be y^ assuered and certifyed by y^ ferme and everlasting
written word of god / t by thy faith only in crystis blood and through his death
only you art saved. And y^ there is no salvation nor part of salvation in any
other thing the^ in him only. For Act. iiij
there is no another name or power under y^ cope of heaven given emonge men
wheryn we might be saved. This thing do all the prophetis bear wytnes / yt who
so beleve in C^yste* / he has forgeuenes of his sins Act. x
through his name. Where in (I pray the) was Adam like christ aftir Paulis
comparison To. v.? verily in no another thing then like as Adam only did
bring in sin / death / and hell: even so did christ a lone bring us grace /
life / and heaven. Paul thus setting forth these similttudes saying. That like
Romans v
as by the sin of only one man / al me^ became mortal: even so and miche
more plentu ously by only one man Jesus christ / the favor of god and
remission of sins is graun ted us. And like as by the sin of one alone /
death reigned through one man Ada^: eue^ so and much more shall they which receive
tha bou^da^t fauou^ with ye g^ft which is rightwy^ nes / reign in life by only
one man which is Jesus Christ.

Again / likewise as by the sin of one man only / conde^nacion came over al
men / even so by the iustifynge of only one man / that rightwysnes which
brings lyse is br ought forth upon al men. For as by only one mannis
disobedience / many became syn ners: eue^ so by yt obedience of one man only
many be made ryghtwyse. So the hitherto tendethe Paulis similitude. That as
Ada^ was that one a lone by whom sin and death entered into almen: cue^ so was
Christ that one alone by whom favor / forgeuenes / ^ life came unto al men.
For the wine press (says christ) I tell you have I trode^ al alone / and of
all the people was there not one with Isayr. lxiij.
me. It was I that trod down my enymes in my fervent wrath. That is to say /
It was I that overcame syn death and the deuel by my nown strength. This was he
al alone that came from Edom with his blody clothes \ as one alone for all\
which had so labored and trodden the wine press. Let us therefore give him all the glory and praise alone / let us not ascrybe any part of our salua cion to
our dedis / ofwhiche eue^ the best be Isayr. xlv. xl^ij
to bad either to satisfye for our sins or to de^ue heaven. It is I / says he
/ that am the rightwyse god and savior besydis who^ there is no another. He
pourged our synnesin his own person or by himself alone. Hebr. i. Paul
begins in the* vii. cap. to the Ebrews to prove the death of christ to be
one ly a sufficient perfait and full oblacion for our sins. which once done
never more it neded not to be iterated nor repeted: for by only that one
oblacion of his body he brought to pass and fynesshed for ever his elect:
And prove the that the priesthed of Aaron Heb. x.
with all their ^ytis and sacrifyces for syn / were insufficie^t and imperfect /
for because it behooved them every day to be repeted and done agene. But Christ
/ because he abydethe for ever: his priesthede cannot be translated Heb. vij
into any successor / for he alone is sufficient: because he alone is able
perfitly with out breach or lak to save who so come to God the father by him.

And if the high bishop alone (says Heb. ix
Paul) did once in the year enter into y^ holy place of the tabernacle made
with mannis hand / with the blood of bestis for his own sins and for the
sins of the people miche more sufficient must Christ alone be for our sins
/ he being him self fautelesse entering that heavenly tabernacle with his own
blood / offeringvp his own blessed body upon the altar of the cross for our
re dempcion. The bishop offered every year on ce / which argued imperfeccion
and insuffici en^y: but Crystis offeraunce was only once for all and ever:
which argues perfeccion and sufficiency. For through yt only one offera^ Heb.
x.
ce of him self / he obtained before God the father a perpetual purgacion
evermore to endure / and remission for the sins of as many as believe in him*
wherefore at the obla cion of his body / all other sacrifices and offera^ ces for
syn thorowt all the world ceased: for his oblacion alone was sufficient. ^ede
the scriptures / and judge (good reder) whether he be an heretyke that says
Christ is an ho le / full and sufficient savior / and so gives him all the
glory and praise of our salvation / or rather More and his church which make
him but half a savior / dividing his glory / some to sayntis merits / some to
our satisfaccio^s / some to our dedis / some to popis pardons pylgrimagis: and
I cannot tell how miche to his own unwritten verites. But had this arrogant
pharisay understood that brief covenant / and gloriouse name of god whereby he
reveled him self to Abram and his posterite in the. xvij. ca. of Genesis where
he calls him self God almighty one alone for all suf ficient / commanding us
to be pure and walk before him: that is to say / to be faithful and direct
our living according to his pleasure and preceptis given to Moses: then would he
never have thus blasphemed his almighty and for all so sufficient holy name /
nether ha Psalm. c. lij
ue put sich lak in him and his written will which he declared sufficiently to
Moses and to the people of Israel. But who is more bold then blind bayerd to
embusye and smatter himself in that thing which he understood not? who is
more fyerce and braggisshe to sheweforth a litel vayn coning then those puftup
papistis with pride and vaynglory which are without al godly knowledge destitute

Then obiecteth More / raging and railing upon us for attributing so myche to
god and so little to our selves: sayng / lo these heretikis destroy and dampne
all good workis. But we answer siche godless barkers agenst god / which are
become abominable and cruel enimes of his word / disobedient and reprobated of
god never to do good workis yt we preche and exhort almen to as many good
works as ever be contained in holy scripture. And yet tell we More again / yt
good workis / though they justify us not (for crystis blood is sufficient
for this point / our faith reching the mercy of God for crystis sake) yet
ought we not / pain of da^nacion to leave them undone. No More than though our
leggis and handis serve us not to se with all: yet ought we not therefore to kut
them of and cast them away but to noresshe and hold them in their propyr
placis and use. we tell him to / yt we be justified by faith only / not for
because we should not do no good workis: but because we should never cease
doing good workis. And we set faith in the first place between us and god / and
good workis between us and our neighbors / to punesshe our rebel flesh / to
profit oother / and to be testimonies of our faith into y^ light and ensample
of all men. Unto thissame obieccion answerth Paul in the beginning of the.vi.
cap. Romans showing by those two interrogacio^s and theffecte of baptism / that
a Christian man by faith has his carnal af fectis so mortified and deed y^ it
is impossible for him to live and dwell in sin / sayng / we that ardeed as
towching sin / how shall we live theryn? etc. where it is plain that sich a
faithful christian / though he fall and syn ne / yet shall he not continue theryn:
so that sin shall not reign nor have dominion over him. Read forth the
chapter. And we affirm with Paul. That Christ by Heb. ix
his blood pourged our consciences from de dely workis / to thentent we should
serve the living God and not cease from his serui ce. Awake therefore ye
adversaries of the faith / and repenteye in time: lest y^ greuouse Isaye xxviij

M. More / to d^yue us from the scriptu re / as though it were for our

a^aunce and lyftvp the ungodly glory of his Anticristen Synagoge: is not
ashamed to affirm and write: That thapostles left out certain unwritten very
tes necessary for our salvation. which necessary trowthes if ye list to have a
taste of: they be these lo / recyted in the. ccc. ix. and. ccc. x. faces of his
third book called. The confutacion. First our ladys perpetual virgini Moris

By these tradicions of the ho ly spirit / says more / has the church also
knowledge how to consecrate / how to say mass / and what thing to pray for /
and to desyer theryn. by this we have knowledge to do reverence to the images of

necessary for owr salvation unwritten verites we must feche at more and his
church yt cannot err. Into y^ which unwritten trouthes to prove yt ye holy
ghost did led thapostles and yt ye apostles delivered them by mouth to more and
his church: More tereth out this text of Joan / sayng yt ye holygost should
led them into every Johan. xvi More is in perel of ye sin a genst ye holy

truth. Note here christian reder / the peste lent purpose and false perverting
of ye scriptu re / which this man here uses in alleging this text: and as thou
seist him peruerte this text so does he al other. And suerly I cannot tell
whether this man thus abuse these wordis of Christ / of ignorance or of a set
malyciouse purpose wetingly to impugn the trwth and so conmit yt greuouse
irremissible sin agenst the holygost / for which saint Johan byddeth us not
to pray. If More be so seen in scripture as he makes him self / and did read
but one live before next this same text and understood it: the^ is it plain yt
he does willingly and wetingly sin agenst the spirit of troth. For there is
it manifest / yt these trowthes into which he promised his spirit to lead them
were siche as then they were to hard for them to understand and bear: himself
saying / when he came to yt hard poyn^ as towchinge the world to be comnneed
and reproved of their false judgment: and to y^ casting forth and condempninge
of the prince thereof at the prechinge of the gospel among the gentyles / Anon
he added saying / As touching these things / yet have I ma ny thingis to tell
you which as now ye ca^ not bear: but when yt same spirit of troth come / he
shall led you into al trowth. By this former text whereupon that at More
allegeth depends (which for what intent he leueth it out / god knowth): it is
plain yt those trowthes were sich as then tha postles for their weakness might
not bear As if Christ should have told them then in their faint faith and
heaviness yt they should have left prechinge to the iwes whom they rekened only
for goddis own beloved people / and have turned to the gentyles who^ they
rekened for haithen / his enymes / and non of his: they could not have borne
this trowthe. For even aftir they had receyned the holy ghost / the best of
them stayed and douted at this point as their actis declare But as for Moris
unwritten verites / as le^ ton fast / halowinge of bows / chalices / ve
stments / and crepinge to ye cross etc. I think if Christ had then told them
/ they could have borne them well enough / for they had borne harder saynges of
him and were acquaynted with harder ceremones prescribed them in Moses law
nothing offended at them. Christ in the same sermon a little be fore told
them in general / into what truth that spirit of troth should led them
saying. He shall teache you and led you into Joan. xiiij
the knowledge of al thingis what so ever I have told you. and if More yet will
prease upon me with his unwritten verites affirminge that those were the things
which he had told them and they could not yet bear them: then do I desyer him
to turn over the lefe into the. xv. cap. And there shall hese yt christ
descended more specially unto these trowthes saying: When yt counforter /
techer / and defender shall come whom I shall send you fro my father / even the
spirit of truth which proceeds of my father / he shall testifye of me. Now
(M. More) look what difference is between this word Me / and Him that said
before in ye. xiiij. cap. It is I yt am ye trowthe: ye / what and if christ him
self be called omnis illa veritas / that is to wit all that same troth into
whom he promised his spirit to lead them? (verily the circunstance of the hole
sermon so de clareth it): and so do Johan expowne it.i. Johan.ij. Let this
term universal / Omnis therefore stand still collectiue in his place as myche
to say as shall led you into al truth comprehended and gathered together in
scripture of christ which is yt most absolute and perfayt troth in whom al
trowthe is contained: and play not the sophister therewith to distribute it so
confusely to lap in your lies under y^ wyd^ skirtis of omnis englyshng it as
ye do saying. Every troth For so every man may se evidently your deuellisshe
dryft. There is difference between All / and every / which both be signyfyed
Exo. ix
by this word Omnis. For theoghe y^ pestelent plage in Exo. slew all their
bestis / so yt it is there written. And Al y^ bestis of Theg^pcions were deed /
yet was it false that every one of their bestis were deed / for ye next plage
following was / y^ both man and best yet living were filled full of bot^hes
and sores. And when y^ priestis and Leuits told king Ezechie saying.
Mundauimus om ^. Par. xxix
nem d^mum domini / the^ meant not every house of ye lord: but all the wholl
temple which was the only house of ye lord. Ne there is Omne malum verbum /
taken for every yuel word / but for the worst yt men Mat. ^
could say by them / as you call us now he retikes sedyciouse etc. And so is
Omnis ve ritas taken for yt most excellent and parfait trowthe even christ /
full of grace and verite of whose fullnes we all receive the favor of Joan. i.
colo. i. ij
our heavenly father etc. whom it have pleased y^ all parfait fulness should
verily and fermely inhabit christ and no more in figures and shadwes. He is
called therefore altrowthe / because yt al men yt ever were or shall be saved must
be saved only through the knowledge i. Ti. ij.
of him / as Paul testifies saying: he will al men to be saved whether he be
I we or ge^ tyle / yt is to say he will of them all both many to be brought
unto ye knowledge of this same so perfect troth Christ / as Paul expowneth him
self in yt place / For all men Ioa^. viij xvij.
to be saved / is not else but to be brought into the knowledge of Christ.

Christ therefore said / the holygoste shall testifye of me: of me and not of my
mothers assumpcion etc. of me and not of lenton fast / of me and not of
halowinge of chalices vestments and creping to crosses. And as towchinge the
perpetual virginite of our lady to be an unwritten verite / I meruel More
forgote this comen Proverb / It behooves a liar to have a good memory / for
anon as he had affirmed it to be an unwritten truth he forgote himself and
goith about to prove it a written truth to \ expowninge non cognosco id est
non cognoscam / which is plain contradiccion in his own words the same to be
both written and unwritten as he take them. Be like more mystruste his brytle
vnwrytein shore / and would yet underprop it with scripture / proving his
unwritten verites to be written to. Saint Jerome was as conynge a clerk and as
well seen in scripture as more / and would have done as myche for our lady as
he since noman now deny her perpetual virginite / especially when Heluidius
laid so sore agenst him for the contrary: and yet could not he prove it by
scripture. And Mores church / this. xv. c. year so stoutly spryted / led into
every trowthe and true understanding of scripture yet could not espy this one
scripture to ma ke for her: but M. doctor More that old holy vpholder and
protector of the papistical Synagoge now at last endwed with higher lerning /
and spryted with a deper spryte / even now comen forth out of purgatory
(blessed be god) has found us out this unwritten written verite / lo. But let
More beware lest he be not licked up with the fla Leui. x.
me of his own coals with Nadab and Abiu / for fetchinge them else where then
at ye auter of god as he commanded. which because they filled their sencers
with strange coals / were suddenly smytendowne deed / burnt with their own
fire. So nighe is the ve^ geaunce of god to fall upon al men yt (goddis holy
scripture neglecte) be not a frayde to bring in strange doctrine / mennis
dremes / unwritten trouthes / into crystischirch as now has more taken in hand
both to sense mennis soulis with his deuelissh doctrine / and to burn as many
as will not believe his lies. But return we into the way. The holy ghost is
called the spirit of truth in deed / but of what troth? verily not of every
truth to lead us therynto as mo re mynseth it: but he is the spirit only of
yt truth which said I am the troth: he is the spirit of this troth and of
all trowthes yt concern him and his doctrine / religion / and faith contained
in the law prophetis and testaments. And into this troth contayninge al
trowthes concerning his glory and our salvation the spirit is promised to lead
ye elect: ye and that by no another way then by the same way y^ said I am y^
way. Into this way to be led / and so forth into this trowth / prayed Psalm.
lxvi
the prophet saying. The lord be merciful and graciouse unto us: he mo^ghe
show us his face / yt his way (and not Mores wyked ways) might be known
through out y^ world and his salvation amon ge al folk. Also he prayed in a
another place Psalm. lxxxv
saying. Lord led me into thy way y^ I might walk in thy trowthe / and not
in Mo ris unwritten verites: for all the ways of ye lord ar mercy and verite:
but All ye ways of More ar cruel tyrany and subtyl false head.

All the ways of the lord ar mercy and verite Psalm. xxv
(says the prophet) unto thez yt seek his testaments and testimonies / for
the two testa ments testisy^ of him / and not Mores vnwry ten vanites. It is a
trowth yt thames ebbethe and flows: and trwe y^ y^ son ryseth in y^ east \
and yt every hole body is greter then each of y^ singler parts there of: into
ye which verites even y^ ungodly be led by their eyes and not by ye holy ghost
/ no more than he neded to have led thapostles into thassum pcion of our lady /
they than being present and lokinge upon her taken up (if she were as sumpte
as I shall show you here after) It is true yt one had made y^ book of y^ Suppli
cacion of beggars. And y^ M. Mok played y^ proctour of purgatory creping forth
gro ning out his Supplicacion of souls. But yet into these trouthes did not y^
holy ghost led any man / for into ye troth yt y^ Suppli cacion of beggars was
written and who wrote In y^ second lef
it / More says himself in his supplicacion of souls / yt y^ devil led him.
wherefore it is not the spirit of troth yt leads into every troth / for there
be some trouthes / as they be unworthy the holy gostis ledinge / so be there
some again so aperte unto our ey es and ears yt they need not his ledinge: of
y^ which kind of trouthes (and reken not his lies) be all Mores unwritten
trouthes which he says be of necessite to be believed. when christ therefore
repeted so often ye spirit of troth / and had said before I am y^ way / the
truth and y^ life / and yt y^ spirit should testify of him self: he does
declare into what trouthes he should led them / even into him self and siche
as concern him / the fontayne / beginning and end of al trowthes and not
into siche trowthes into which our eyes and senses led us / but into siche as
he is the spirit of / the sercher / and very techer of. And therefore Paul
speking of ye perfant wisdom of god concerning ye red empcio^ of man by ye
death of christ / which wysdom lay yet hyd from ye gentiles and fro many of ye
Iwes ^ i. cor. ij.
to: so y^ another eye saw it / nor ear hard it nor heart could think it /
and was to one foles hnes and to ye the other sclawnderous / yet god at last
reveled it by his spirit of trowthe and led y^ apostles in to it: which else
would never have believed yt ye Gospel should have been preched to y^ ge^tyls.
And eue^ this is one of those hard poyntis wherefore christ said / yet have I
many things to tell you which ye cannot now bear. but wha^ yt spirit of troth
come / he shall led you into al troth. of wh ich (I say) eue^ this yt ye
kingdom of christ should be enlarged and his gospel preched thorowt among al
ye ge^tils was ye chefiste as ye pistles of Paul being y^ doctor and precher
sent unto thez plainly declare and especially his pistle to ye Ephesens where
this place of John is expowned at large. For it is the spirit y^ sercheth all
siche deep mysteris as Paul there call this troth both in his pistle to ye
Ephesens and also to ye Corinthes sa ynge. God has reveled it us by his spirit
/ for ye spirit ensetcheth al thingis eue^ ye deep misterys of God / ^ is to
wit as concerning y^ matter y^ there Paul entreteth of / as y^ creacion / y^ fall
/ and rede^pcion of man whither he be Iwe or ge^tyle / by crystis death very god
and man. For as noman knowth y^ mind and plesures of god but y^ spirit of god
/ so every man sercheth the^ but in vain / save only ye spirit i. cor. ij.
of god. The spirit of troth therefore sercheth us out y^ mysteris and
secrets of god / which we by our own senses and corrupt na ture cannot
attain to / nor co^prehende in our hartis by natural reason / nether yet any
natural wit can understand. We have not received ye spirit of y^ world / but
ye spirit which is of god (says Paul) yt we might know what things ar given
us of christ. y^ i. Cor. i
is to weit: eue^ crist hiself y^ most absolut ve rite salvation and life*
petual through hi which is made of god our wisdom rightwys nes holiness and
rede^pcio^. unto this eua^gelik verite and secret wysdom of god / looked David
in y^. vi. verse. of y^. li. Psalm. and these giftis we preche says paul / not
with wordis which man nis wysdo^ and painted eloque^s teache / but with sich wordis
as y^ holy ghost recheth layngfor th and expowning spiritual thingis unto the
spiritual child^rn. Now I pray you what spiritual point is there in Mores
vnwryte^ verites / as to halow vestme^tis chalices etc. what needs here any
spiritual exposici on or laynge forth of so carnal and sensible ceremones?
every natural witt^d with his come^ sensis may perceue moris unwritten verites /
and se them to / to be stark vain vanites* But the natural wise man
perceyueth not those things y^ are of the spirit of God etc.

But now let us se one or two of Mores unwritten verites. First as for the per
petual virginite of our lady: I never dou ted thereof / before either I knew or
hard of Mores church or hard Mores probacion expowninge non cognosco for non
cog noscam / no I never yet hard any man do ute thereof / but yet is it not a
trewthe neces sary for our salvation / no more than it was necessary for
Abraham's Isaakis and others elect^ of y^ old testame^tis salvation which never
hard thereof: And as for our ladys assumpcion / it is an unwritten trowthe in
Our ladys as sumpcio^
deed not contained (as more says) in holy scripture / nether a trwthe
concerning christ nor pertayninge to our salvation. For wh ither she was
assumpte or not: yet be we ne thelesse redeemed by crystis death. besydis this:
if she had been assumpte to heaven body and soul / y^ apostles lokynge on / she
letinge fall among them her girdle and b^dis as Mores church fableth / so had
they not neded y^ spirits serchinge nor ledinge into this truth for their own
eyes should have certi ^^ed thez. And to tell you y^ very trowth of this
unwritten verite. Saint Jerome / who me More and his chirch take for their
autour of this truth / says plainly in his sermon of her assumpcio^ (if it be
his) which is divided into hirlegende on y^ day. That she was buried in y^
veil of Iosaphat he seeing her grave / but nothing in it: but how / what ^yme
/ or of whom (says he) her body was taken thence / or whother it be
trans^osed / or wether she be risen / we cannot tell And before he says /
Many of us doubt whither she was assumpte together with her body or whither she
went her way / her bo die here left behind her. of this unwritten legende Lo /
wheryn in it is dowted both of y^ author and verite / since thautor him self
do^teth / More and his chirch fetched their unwritten troth / and would thrust
it in to us am ong our articles of our faith: and with his new vnwryte^ articles
as he goth about to byld us a new chirch / so would he prech us a new gospel /
write us a new creed / and set us up a ^ew and a another savior besides christ.
Forthermore as for praynge to saints and worshi Deute. vi x Mat. iiii.
ping of stockis and stones / as it is ungodliness ^ plain Idolatry / so is it
no testimony of Christ / nor necessary trwthe / but plain agenst goddis ^orde
saying. Thy lord God shall thou worship and him only shall thou honor and
cleue to. And agene. There is no man y^ p^ayeth and calls to a saint but he
shows himself to believe and trust in ye same Romans x
saint. Paul saying. How shall they call upon any in who^ they believe not? Christ
is our mean and intercessour only between God To. viij 1. T 1. ij. 1. Ioa^.
ij
our father and us / a sufficient advocate continually with ye holy ghost making
intercession with sighs unspeakable before ye father for us. To forbere flesh
and ^te fysshe / to fast lento^ were not so hard points to the apostles but
they could have borne them at crystis mouth as well as y^ other Iwes did bear
si che and harder ceremones at Moses mouth y^ was but man only. To fast lent
as it testifies me not criste / so is it no article necessary of my faith. for
if I / or any man would so fast it / as to believe to be saved for y^ deed doing
/ tha^wer christ deed for us in vain. by Gal. ij.
these / iug thou his ^other vnwryte^ vanites

Yet for a more clear understanding of this text. The holy ghost shall led you
into al troth: let us to^lider what goth before and what follows / y^ we may
se perfitly what truths these were \ to decerue the^ from Mo ris lies. and to
begin: ye shall understand (cryste^ reders) y^ this is Mores pestele^t pro
perte in alleging scriptures to furnessh his heresies. First slegth holy to
snatchout ate xt of ye hole sentence / ye wordis before and folo wing whereof ye
true understanding depe^de th / preuely of a poison purpose left clean out* T
ha^ seweth he to a false gloss of his o wn shaping / and so a false supposicio^
once lay de \ he proceeds to frame and fynesshe his de nii^issh drift / here
and there in his deduccio^ stre wing his process with lordly checks tauntis /
mockes and lies / colors of his own wont retryk. But thou shall first note /
for y^ espy A rule to vnde rstande ye scripture
ing out of this ungodly deceyte and serpe^tine fraud / and for ye very truth
of ye text so torn and ma^gled: what thing ye author ente^deth che ifely in yt
process / cha* holepistle / or gospel wheryn thou percase redest and then look
how he refers every argument and sayng to his purpose. and because y^ author
diuerteth and make eth a digressio^ from his principal intent: some thing
incide^tly offered to his mind: mark werhe gothforth and were he returns to
his purpose: and never lat y^ principal intent of hi^ prefixed to which al ye
process te^deth go fro thy mind. observe also diligently ye use of his wordis
/ manner of spech / and what his words signifye. Tha^ al ye process so scatred
gather thou together / co^fer and frame every perte to y^ end and intent yt ye
Author purposed: And the shall thouse both thissame conferring and framing
together of these sentencis / not only to be ye light in derknes / ye
exposicion of all ij. Pet. i
and thinfallible rule of ye truth / but also the very tried tryacle agenst ye
vyrulent venom of al heritiques / yt in so tering and rending out scripture /
falsely gloss / violently wrest and blasphemously abuse y^ holygostis wordis to
stablessh their heresies. As More would by this text of Christ. when ye spirit
of troth shall come etc. prove and stablesshe yt y^ apostles left aught
unwritten etc. Here therefore first shalt thou restore this text into his own
place agene. Johan. xvi. And the^ look where yt process began / and what christ
intended in it. And to help thy labors. Begin at y^. xiij. cha. Where thou
shall se y^ christ consydering ye old passover remembered ye new / wheryn also
he should bodily pass out of this world to his father / for by his godhed he
was ever present with him / there shall thou se what love he did bear to his
derebeloued disciples / and the sowper ended / what homble service he did thez
in ^^asshing their fete / and again what an unloving towche one of them should
show him so yt at last / he prepared unto his purpose / begane his sermon
unto them almost in the end of the cha. saying / My sweet son nes / yet a
little while am I with you. ye shall also seek me / as I told the Iwes / but
whother I go / ye may not come etc. Here they perceiving that he would depart
fro them / were full heavy, which heaviness came by the reason of their ignorance
and unbelief / for al^eit they had confessed him some time before to be both
God and man / yet now when the bronte oftentacion was at hand / they were with
out both knowledge and faith in him / so litell did it profit them his bodily
presence / Than did Criste to dely uer them from their heaviness and to set them
in a perfe it belief go forth with his ser moan / saying in the. xiiij. cap.
let not yowr hearts be thus trowbled with heaviness. If ye believe in god / ye
believe in me etc. For all his intent was to lead them into the belief of him
both god and man even that most absolute troth. And wha^ they hard him
mind again his going away / baringe them in hand that they knew whother
he went and the way to. Thomas to declare their ignorance answered that they
ke new nether / whother he went nor yet the way. And than christ said he was
the way / the trowthe and the life. and at last cold them that he would send
them the holy go ste / his spirit / the spirit of truth a counforter a
defender and techer to them in his bodyly absence / and that this spirit of
troth should testify of him which called him self that trowth / the time
will not suffer to expende and to compare every part of this sermon continuing
unto the end of the xvij. cha. wherefore I leave this labor unto the c^ysten
reder whom I beseech that spirit of trowth to lead by the same way that there
is prefixed / into that troth that christ there did set before their eyes \ into
whom when they are led / they are led into all trowthe. But briefly / the
entente of christ was to setle and to confirm them in the belief of himself
ere he went his way / and for their counforte to send them that counf^r ter
techer and defender / eu^n his spirit of trowthe: which when h^ should come /
he should reason rebuk^ and convince ye world of sin / of rightwisnes and of
iugment And because More says y^ ^^indal wresteth th^se word is as falsely
agenst him self and his church / as y^ devil did ye scripture agenste Ciys^e /
saying y^ ye world here is taken for the Iwes and paynems: I shall declare th
is word World for Moris confusion as The w orlde
christ takes it in ye cap. before / for siche ungodly whom ye world favors
and laugheth upon / which hate his members and pe rsecute him and his word in
them / even for More and his church / ye bisshops and their faccion / whom
there is none more vayn glorious worldly and wyked. The world is here they yt
believe not yt Jesus Criste is our sufficient satisfaccion / red empcion /
rightwysnes / and yt faith in him only saves not / that there is no another
name by whom we may be saved than Jesus Crist / but believe to be justified by
workis / and i^ge falsely of god and his word whose glyteringe rightwysnes and
false judgment y^ holy ghost here this day rebukes / of this sect
pharisa^^cal is More and his chirch / and ar and shall be rekened / resoned with /
rebuked and conuineed of ye Holygoste were they cry stened an. C. times. For
this Gospel was written as well to rebuke us as either Iwe or paynem. He shall
rebuke ye world of judge meant / for ye prince of this world is eue^ now (said
Christ) discerned. And even here is ye principal whereof christ was mou^d to set
to these wordis. Adhec multa hab^o que vo bis dicam etc. as concerning these
forsayde iij. poyntis and especially ye last / I have yet many things said
christ to tell you / but ye cannot now bear them. But when yt spirit even ye
spirit of troth shall come / he shall le de you into al trowth: for ye
understanding therefore of this last point whereupon depends Mores text
which he so falsely wresteth* ye shall know y^ it was prophesied and figur^d
v^ry often y^ ye gentyles should be called into Crystis church: and his gospel
preched to al nations / his kingdom should be dilated and enlarged unto the
vttermo ste costs of therthe: which unto yt time was contained but in Judah and
Israel a litel Cap. ij. and. xlij. Psalm. ij.
angle of ye world / of this prophecye read Isaye and y^ Psalms. Ask of me
(said the father to christ) and I shall give ye / ye gentyles for thy heretag^.
ye shall also consider ye corrupt judgment of ye Iwes in this cause / beleuinge
y^ they only were goddis people / yt god only was their god and not ye god of
ye gentylis to / they re^ened and iuged ye gentyles / and do yet as we do them
/ godless swyne and heithen how ^dis: In so miche that they iuged his gospel
never to be preched among us / and of this opinion were eue^ y^ best of y^
apostles / and y^ aftir ye holygost was comen / and some of them stoke so sore
to their ceremones of y^ law / as circuncisio^ etc. yt they thought after yt
ye gentyles were called to y^ gospel / yet could they not be saved unless they
had been circuncysed to. Also after Act. x
ye Peter was monesshed by a vision y^ he should not doubt to preche ye gospel
to ye ge^ tyles and receive Cornelius with his famylye yt were gentilis / and
baptize them / yet to se what both he and Paul sufferd of ye Iwes Act. xi.
and. xxij
for preching ye gospel to ye gentyles / ye may know how corrupt their
judgment was As concerning this matter therefore Christ said I have many things
to tell you which ye cannot now bear etc. It was now I ensuer you an hard
point for them to have believed yt they their self should preche ye gospel to
ye gentiles and forsake their own nation ye Iwes: unto whom Christ had said Mat.
x
warninge them before / when he sent th em to preche / y^ they should not come
amon ge ye gentylis etc. For to receive this truth and to preche y^ gospel
into among the gentylis / it required a great gift and an high spirit / even
ye conversion of Paul and his fervent spirit and labors above all y^ other
apostles. And then compare these hercules labors of Paul / and of ye other
apostles in this cause / unto Moris unwritten vanytes / as halowinge of
vestmentis / chalices and crepinge to y^ cross: and read Paulis pistles and
especially ad Ephesios (as light as More makes it) and consider how sore he
sweteth and laboreth this har de trowthe. Now for ye declaracion of ye worcester dis
of y^ text / where stands this wo^de I^ dicium which comenly signifies
Judgment Judgment
and discrecion / how be it because one thin ge follows of a another as at the
contrary judgment of diverse rulers there follows mutacions and changes in
arcalme / it is a comen saying. New lordis new laws and so new iugementis /
therefore judgment may Ioa^. ix
be englesshed some time mutacion and change / as Christ said. Into judgment am
I come into this world / y^ they yt se not should s^ / and they yt se should be
blind. That is / I am come to make a change. It was a mer (...)ouse change / ^
ye blind borne should se and ye quyke eyed pharisayes so well learned Ioa^. xij
should be made stark blind. Also. Now said C^yste is y^ judgment of this
world / y^ is to wit this world shall be now changed. Why so? for ye prince
thereof shall be cast forth / y^ is ye devil shall be cast forth and Cr yste shall
come in. I saw (said Christ) Satan ^uc. x
fallinge down from heaven like a lyghteninge / at whose fall Christ was
exalted unto the kingdom over all this world: for a stronger armed has met with
him and overcome him etc. Now ye se the change of these princes / whereof
follows y^ change of this world. Under Satan the gentyles worshipped stockis
and stones / and the Iwes stood upon their workis: under christ we worshipe god
the father in spirit yt is to say in verite: and hope for salvation for our
faith in Christ that same verite. But whereby came this alteracion and so
graciouse a change? verily through the prechinge of the gospel of the kingdom /
that is through the prechinge of Christ. Isaye thus prophecyinge. cap. xlij
I shall enryche him with my spirit and he shall preche judgment unto the gentylis
/ that is to say my gospel of the kingdom of heaven: at whose prechinge the
world shall be altered and changed into a better state: and they shall discern
and judge this change to be godly: for the prince of this world shall be
casteforthe and discerned to be a contrary prince unto Christ / and that by the
word that tries all things. And now because More will say that this matter
and judgment pertayn^d to the Iwes only and not to us although we be
gentylis / but of a another world than it was than. He shall know / that with in
this. xij. year there has been a great alteracion and yet continue the and
shall be yet at greter muta cion than we look fore: which mutacion be ga^e and
continues at the preching of the pure gospel and translating of it into al lan
guegis. by this word of god now reuyu^d and spread so broad / we judge and
disce^ne the pope the prince of this world^ (for he is more carnal and worldely
than the worl de it self) to be y^ very Anticryste / and we se him now we
More and their faccion in castinge forth / and that by the mighty word of god:
and they shall be slain with the breath of goddis mouth. But the world whose
prince the pope and his sect are / of whom More is yet one / judge that the
gospel that thus alters this world is heresye / and the cause of s^dicion:
and Anticrist and his faccion / to be the chirch of god / and the very poor
church of the elect whom they burn to be herityques: But awake ye
Anticristis out of your wykednes. For y^ holygoste is now comen with his word
wr yten to dispute to reason to reken with you to rebuke and convince you for
this perverse judgment. For it is Anticryst I tell* you and not the head of
Crystis chirch / even the pope the prince of this world now espied de cerned
by goddis word and shall be cast forth of his kingdom shortly.

Now let us se what follows Mores text / that if by that circumstance yet we
may gather more light / in to these truths. It follows for he shall not speak
of him self / but he shall speak whatso ever he has hard and tell you the
things to come The father had spoken to the world by Heb. i.
the fathers Moses and prophetis whose wordis were written / the holy ghost had
har de them and now should speak them / christ also had spoken them but yet
were they not understood / the gospel should be preched among the gentiles
aftir crystis ascen sion / this the spirit should teache them / and so he should
glorifye me said christ / and not any other creature / as More would have bows
belles water and ashes hallowed and glorified by leding into these trouthes:
for he shall r^ceyue of my word and teache it you. where christ therefore left in
teching his disciples even at those so hard points y^ they could not yet bear
the^ / there begane y^ holy ghost with the^ again aftir crystes asce^sion. But first
because christ said he would be fro them a little while and then come agene as
after his resurreccion: sith he was so diligent and louinge a Master
continually applyinge his scolers whom he had now taken in hand to teache / yet
left in ignorance as touching those hard poyntis which they could not then
bear before hi^ death / taking them for the and preparing them into the schole
of the holy ghost: let us se what communicaci on he had with them and what
doctrine he taught them. Although I know that Mo re here seweth to a another
tail / for thus al legeth he the text / saying when the spirit of troth shall
come / he shall led you into every troth (Every trowth say^h more and not al
troth / so feign would he here lappyn his lies to) And put you in remembran
side. cc. viij. of Mores book
ce of all that I my self have or would say unto you etc. Which is not there
following that text / but More patcheth it to of his own because he would
deduce a false dedu ccion of a false supposicion / for than deduceth he thus
saying. And since he said not the holy ghost shall wryt unto you al thingis nor
shall write you al truth / but shall led you into al truth / we deduce
thereupon that the belief where ynto the spirit of god ledeth us and planteth
it in our heart is as good and as suer to salvation without any writing at al /
as if it were written / This is Mores wise deduccion / Lo. The holygost led them
into al truth / ergo al those trouthes be not written / christ said not the
holy ghost shall write them / ergo they were nether written in y^ old nor yet
aftyrwarde in ye new testement. like argumentis More makes in other places:
God promised to write his law in their hartis / ergo the law was not written
in books. what a blyn de Pha^ysaye is this? But turn we again into ye way.

Christ after his resurreccion / notwithstanding so many lessons and warninges
before had of his spiritual kingdom and redemption to be sprede into among
the Iwes and gentylis both: yet fyndinge his disciples in their old douteful
wekenes and ignorance / and hardness of belief / yt is to wit / even in ye same
state where he left them when he said / As concerning these thingis / yet have
I many thingis mo to tell you which ye cannot now bear etc. rebuked them saying
/ O foles and dull hearted to bele Iuc. xixiij.
ue al those thingis (meaning y^ verites and trouthes which he would have then
taught them before) which the prophets have spoken of me. Here apereth it
plainly yt those trouthes / that christ there mente into which the spirit
should led them / and More makes them unwritten verites / should be siche as
were written in the prophetis: So that this text The holy ghost shall led you
into al trouthes / is as miche to say / as into al trouthes written of Christ
before in the law prophetis and Psalmis. This is the undoubted troth of the
text. For Christ the same day aperinge unto his disciples / and beginning at
the same lesson The last ca. of Luke
where he left with them before his death said. These are the words which I
spoke unto you when I was yet with you: that it should be necessary al things
written in the law of Moses / prophetis and psalms to be fulfulled of me / of
me says he / and not of any other. And here as Ioa^ says Ioa^. xx
/ he breathinge upon them saying take the holygoste / they received the first
fruits and foretaste of the spirit with ye truths by a little and little to be
led into the^ as he once had promised them / but aftyr their capacite and
weakness he here like a wise master took them ever forth from under ye
ceremones and letter of Moses preparing them to ye spirit and troth of the
gospel, tha^ (says Luke) opened he their hartis and myndis yt they might
understand the scriptures (ye scriptures says Luke and not Moris unwritten
verites) and said to the^. Thus and thus is it wryte^ (and not thus said I
without writing) Now mark well christian reder yt at folouth and you shall se al ye
truths yt ye holygost led the^ into. It behooved christ (says he) to suffer /
and to rise from death ye third day / and repe^ta^ce and remission of sins to
be preched under his name into among al ye ge^tils. Now co^fer these wordis to
those so breifely knyt up. Johan. xvi. aftyr which he said: as concerning these
yet have I many things to tell you etc. for albeit \ it was hard for their
weakness to bear ye form of our rede^pcio^ by his death and resurrection and ye
calling in of ye ge^tils into his chirch: yet was this point tha^ so strange /
yt yet for all this lesson to \ it could not synke into their hartis. and this
preching said he shall be gyn at Jerusalem. Your selves shall be ye witnesses of
these wordis / yt is / your selves shall prech the^. If all this will not yet
satisfy Mo resvnsanery mouth: we will go farther eue^ to Wytsonday where ye
holygost and yt promise was fully performed and y^ verites lyk as here
expressed: wherinto they were led* where as soon as they were enspyred and set a
fire with y^ spirit and led into these trouthes: they co^ de not long hold their
tongues but prech^^ them by and by even as the spirit led them into them all:
And now are we in the sueres^ way to try out this matter and in a another
manner dedu^cion than More deduceth us. And first note / y^ Christ having
respect unto their imbe^ilite and weakness to Act. i.
bear these trouthes and to profess them openly: and also puttinge them in
remembe tance of their own infirmite said. ye shall receive strength / aftir
y^ y^ holy ghost come into you / and ye shall preche me not only in Isaye. xlix.
Jerusalem / but also in all Judea Samaria / ye and even unto ye vttermoste
coostes of y^ ^^the. by which he mente among ye gentyles. Now turn we over
y^ leif to ye. n. ca. Act. ^ij. iiij. v. etc
of y^ Actis of y^ Apostlis / and there shall we seplainly how all this said
before with their sermons to through ye actis / and ye pistles of Paul agree
together / one place euermo^e confirminge and declaringe another. For there did
Peter with y^. xi. as soon as ye spirit had led them into these trouthes \ stand
up in Jerusalem (for it was prophesied and tol de them before yt there they
should begin to preche these verites) and first / y^ false opinion of the
I^^^ beleuinge y^ disciples to have been droncken / taken away / he told them
constantly / prechinge even as Christ had taught them before immediately after
^is resurreccion / when they were yet full w^ke. Art. i^.
Luke. xxiiij. That this same man who^ they had put to death was Jesus Christ /
se^ite from god ye father: and given them to win them with doctrine and miracles
/ whom by ye ferme decre and fore knowledge of ye father so betrayed and
delyuerde up / when ye had received at ye handis of ye ungodly / ye ^^ucyfyed
and slew: whom god ye father losed fro y^ bondis of death and stered up agene
etc. Now (good Christian reder) read al ye process and communicacion yt Christ
had with these his disciples before he sand. yet have I many thingis as touching
these points Luke. xxii^j.
etc. Into which ye holy ghost shall led you when he come / and compare them
unto the verites y^ Christ opened them as soon as he was risen / and proved it
them by scriptures and especially in ye Psalms: And then look here now in this
sermon folowinge whose substance Luke recites / and consider whither these be
not y^ same trouthes / ye and yt sufficient trouthes whom whosoever receive and
believe as ye end and conclusion of the sermon testifies plainly / ar saved.
Look and if al these trouthes be not plent^ ously and constantly confirmed with
the scrip tures? They here affirmed his ascension b^ scriptures / and also to
sit on his fathers ^^ ghthande / ye and even here said they in the first h^ete
of the spirit. That this promise of christ was made both to the Iwes / to their
childerne / and to all that are a far to by which wordis taken of the prophet
I* say* Paul descrybed the gentyls. They preched Ephesians. ij.
now constantly that this same was that sead and fruit of David so often prom
ysed in the law and prophetis / and that now he thus exalted by the righthande
of the father / the promise of the holy ghost ob tayned of him / he has powered
forth eue^ this that you now se and here / Note these last wordis well / se and
here. what saw they? what hard they else but the verites in to which he
promised the spirit to lead th em / of which the first is. That this man
Jesus of Nazareth was given them of the father / this verite was written in the
prophetis / and Christ told them to that he was come from the father /
secondarily Peter and the. xi. preched them here that he wrought his wondres
and miracles amon ge them by ye power of ye father / and that the father
wrought them by him. Thirdely that by the decreed counsel and fore knowledge of
his father he was so betrayed dely uerd into their handis / crucified and killed
by the handis of the wyked. Fourthely god stered him up agene losed from the
sorrows of death since it was impossible for hi^ to be holden any longer of
death. These verites Peter proves by the Psalms as cry ste had before
interpreted them to him and his felawes Luke the last ca. and here now the
holy ghost had perfitly led them into th em. So that now the Iwes were
persuaded him to be the very son of god the fath er / and both god and man.
And where Mo re says in his dialoge and also in this his las^e new book the.
ccxl. side. That Peter did forbere in this sermon to call Christ God / lest
it should have hyndred the faith in that audience. Every man may here se how
ignorant he is in scriptures / and what an herysye he would pycke out of so
play ne a place where Peter his principal purpo se was to prove Christ that
very Messiah / god and man / even ye sone of god. For were there not about.
iij. thousand converted to the faith at that sermon? and of what faith would
More there make them if they believed not that christ was god? If Pe ter dirste
not preche it / but left this principal article out / how then believed they
it? In deed More gothe about to make him no god \ and that can I prove him
plainly if he will stand to his wrytinge. But cryste^ reder thou shall know
that Peter's purpo se with all the. ^i. was principally to prove him both god
and man / contrary to Moris heresy / Peter alleged the Psalms sayn ge. Non
davis sanctum tuum etc. That is / thou shall not suffer thy holyone to be
corrupted in the earth. For when they hard this word holyone / they believed
that he was god: for it was the name appropryed unto god in the law and
prophetis / and they were well acquaynted with that name: the prophetis and law
calling god evermore the holy one of Israel / that is he that makes holy
Israel / which they knowleged to be their god only / unto which name Gabriel
looked answeringe our lady / saying. That holy one which is borne of the shall be
called the son of god. Luc. i. And Peter here called him the lord / which
name the Iwes take for god only. And alleged also the same psalm whereby christ
him self* confounded the pharisayes. Mat. xxij preuinge him self to be very
god. Here may ye se what a busynes it is to have to do with these heritikes that
deny christ to be god and so belie Peter saying that he forebore to call him
god / because he says i would have hindered the faith / in that audience. What
audience / I pray ye were they? were they notsiche as god had chosen? were they
not his sheep that should hear his voice? should the chief article then of
their faith that christ is god / offend his flock? He call led him first of al
man: saying this man Jesus etc. what than? ergo he forbore to call him god?
Peter first declared him to have dyed which his godhed suffered not but his
manhed only. and this declared / he proved him to be god also. But More does
as he is wont / snatche and tere out a wo^de of the hole text and so run
away with it to prove his deuilleshe purpose / to blind the people / nether
consyderinge what follows nor what goth before / no^ yet will he suffer any lay
man to se his falsehed no^ other mennis answers. The fyfte verite that they
preched / was that this same holy one Christ both God and man was ye sede of
David so often promised in the law and prophetis. And here they removed a way
by scriptures that opinion of the Iwes wh erby they wrested the scriptures to
be vnde rstanden of the Propher David / and decla ringe his exaltacion by the
righthande of god into a another manner of kingdom tha^ ever David or Solomon
had (as the Iwes yet dream and wait for) brought in at last this other
truth: that he had obtained th em of his father by his death the promise of
the holygost now fulfille de whom (said Peter) he has powe^d forth upon us
even this thing that ye now / both se and hear / to here is a taste of those
trwthes into which the holygost led them / far unlike Mores unwritten dremes
/ And here is christ proved also to be very god in that / he says the
holygoste procedethe of him. But let us hear out al Peter's sermon how he
conclude the saying. Wherefore all the house of Israel might know for a su^^te
y^ god has made this same Jesus whom ye have crucified lord and anointed /
that is to say the anointed lord and king over al / both Iwes and gentyls.
And here may ye se how this sermon tended into Christ as very god in whom al
trouthes were contained necessary for theirs and our saluaci on. Now confer
this ledinge into al these trouthes unto the promise where he said the spirit
shall testifye of me etc. of me said he and not of my mother nether yet of lent
fast / halowinge of vestementis etc. and cre pinge to the cross. That is to
say / ye led into the knowledge of me by the spirit / ^hal testifye and
preche me / as now may every man se in the performinge of crystis promy se.
Than afterward the sermon done / ye hartis of the Iwes were p^icked in the^
selves and they said to Peter and to his felawes. what shall me do ye men our
brethren? Repent ye (said Peter) and be baptized etc. which is even the same
that christ taught them before to preche / the first frutis of the holygoste
tasted / Luke the last. Lo here are al truths necessary to be believed and
repentance preched in one sermon / al confirmed with the scriptures / this
gospel they preched al with one mouth: and did write it agene and again and
declare it in every pistle and sermon unto both Iwes and gentiles / for as they
al professed one lord / one faith / one baptysme / so preched they al one
gospel written before in the law prophetis and psalms. Read all the sermons
ofthapo stles through the Acts and especially saint Steuens sermon in the. vij.
and Paulis in ye. xiij. ca. and y^ shall se how they preched nothing with out ye
autorite alleged of ye scriptures. For it was prophesied in y^ Psalms yt y^
Iwes own table yt is to say their own scriptures should be their own trappe
and confusion: of y^ which table said David in Ps. xxij
y^ person of us. The lord fedeth* me / where fore I can want nothing. Even
here lo / is ye sufficiency and perfitfulnes of y^ scripture proved agenste
More / for David here compares y^ scripture to a plentuouse suffi cient
paslure unto ye which Paul looked. i. Cor. iij. when he said. I nouresshed you
up with milk as young infantes in christ / and not with fast mete / for ye might
not yet bear it. Thou haste sprede me a table said David in y^ presence of my
adversaries meaning ye scripture where stands forth meat for a^ manner
me^nis mouths / no another wise t^an yt Manna in wyldernes fallen f^o^ heaven
Ex. xxi
satisfied every man sufficiently and sauoured what so ever he would eat.
Christ him self recyted ye scriptures for ye confyrmacyon of his sermons. He
expowned them / and would not have ye Iwes to believe him with out their
testimony / Paul almost writes nothing but ye scriptures and expownerh
them. And shall we believe More with his bishops at their bare wordis? If they wol
de challenge and adscrybe to their self this pryuilege and honor above christ
and his apostles / so declare they them self to be yt same son of perdicion
yt sits in y^ temple of God lokynge for an honor even to be borne up with
sich a worshype / as christ him self never looked fore. Sed spirituoris sui
interficiet eum dominus. But ye lord shall slaye him with the breath of his
mowthe. AMEN. i. cor. xi Moris second shore.


A another text More allegeth for th is his heresy: taken out of Paul. Cetera
cum venero ipse disponam / as for other things I shall set in ordyr when I
come. Which things Paul might have written to them as he did / and yet come
never at them more / or if he had come / yet might he have set things in o^dyr
wtoute any preching / or if he had preched / yet might he ha ue preched ye same
gospel which he had pre ched them before which he preched unto al ye gentiles
and confirmed it by ye testimo Act. xviij
ny of scriptures. But ye very truth (christian reder) is this: Paul was among
ye Corin these a year and. vi. months / ere he wrote them these wordis. Cetera
cum venero etc. And what gospel he preched them y^ while for their conversion
and salvation / he af firmethe. 1. Corint ij. saying. Brethren. when I came
unto you / I came not with high eloquence of speech reasoninge my matter with
mannis wisdom when I preched you the testimony of God (mar^e well this / the
testimony of God. which is the scripture that testifye and preche god) For I
professed myself than being with you nothing else to know but Jesus Christ and
that he was crucified. And again / thus w^yteth he. Brotherne I put you in mine
i. cor. xv
de of my gospel that I preched you which ye received / in which ye stand /
by which ye are saved etc. where it is p^ayne by y^ woe rdis following / that his
gospel is the very same that Christ taught ^^s disciples at his departinge and
ag^ne aftir his resurrecci on / even the very same into which as into al
truth the holy ghost led them. For as th^^ were al enstr^^te and led of one
spi rit / so agre^d the^ al upon one Gospel one truth even christ the very
fountain of al truth to b^ preched for the salvation both of the I^^es and
ge^tyls. And this gospel (says Paul in the samecha.) was wry^^n i. cor. rv
^om. i
long ^ fore in the scriptures / and pr omysed in the scripturis by the
prophetis Also Paul consyderinge that it was no le sse labor to defend his
flock / then to beget them (since so many false prophetis creptyn after him to
seduce them) he did wry te them his Pistles / not to teache them any other
faith then they had first received by his prechinge: but to confirm them in
the same and to defend them from the fall se proph^tis doctrine / saying I
write these things unto you to moneshe you as my dear childerne: for have ye
never so many i. cor. iiij
techers / yet have ye not many fathers: for it was I that begote you in Christ
by the gospel. And as for the matters that Paul said he would dispose and o^dir
at his cominge: If ye begin and read the Pistle till ye come to this place / ye
shall se what conten sion and disorder / what was out of frame among them /
and how there Paul wro te unto them these things to be redressed by express
scripture orels by the rules left in scripture / that is to wit by faith and
love / and at last he cominge unto a great disorder and faw^e / in eatinge the
lordis sowper / which when he had rebuked / and showed them the very use
thereof to be eaten in the memoryall / and rememberaunce of his death / he addid
therto\ in y^ later end of ye cap. as for other things (concerning this
sowper says Jerome) I shall set in ordyr when I come. Now to set in ordyr is
not here to preche them necessary trwthes for their salvation as Mo re
fayuethe: For these had he preched and written them long and often before all
that year and an half / prechinge with them his Gospel / of which he writes
in y^. xv. cap. thus which Gospel ye received / and yet abide still in it / by
which ye have your salvation. where it is play^ / yt this Gospel written was
suffcient for their salvation / and it is not true yt every necessary truth
for our salvation should not be contained in y^ scripture. And much more ought
More to be ashamed / if he were not paste shame so falsely to allege and to
wreste this scripture for his porpose. For after this / Paul wrote them his
second Pistle / where in y^ first cap. he excuses himself with many wordis y^
he coud^ not come to them as he promised in y^ first Pistle wherefore / as
forsiche thingis which he partly promised to set in ordyr / he he^e writes
them / as y^ reconcylyng of y^ Corinthean y^ h^d married his stepmother / whom
^e i^ y^. v. ^a. of his first^ Pistle commanded to be taken out of y^
congregation / with many other thingis / as every diligent reder of y^. ij.
Pistle may clearly perceive. But here by ^ ^aye of co^ municacion I would ask
M. More when Paul came agene to y^ Corinthes to preche them these other
necessary trouthes / co^ tayned in this word. Cetera etc. For I will deny yt
ever Paul came there aftyr by y^ way of communicacion. And if he came not
there / then preched he not them. And because he could not come according unto
his promise he wrote them this second Pistle to counforte to confirm and to
defend them / ag^nste those false prechers / y^ went about to seduce them and
to destroy y^ he had ^y^ded / where in as every reder may se he disposed and
ordered perfitly by his wrytinge althinges yt were amysse among them. If so
necessary trouthes were contained in this text. Cetera cum venero etc. as More
faynethe / think ye yt so louinge an herd man so tenderinge his flock would
have left them out? Namely when he writethe agene so long a Pistle wheryn he
occupies his pen sometime in things which he said himself it neded not
gretely to have written them / and occu piethe some part thereof with greting is
from other men / would he (think ye) have put in these not necessary for there
salvation and left out thingis so necessary for it? Also read the. xvi. chap.
of the first pistle / and thou shall se hun self partly express those other
certain thingis which he would ordyr at his cominge \ where he remembers a
collecte to be disoosed among the p^ re sayntis and faithful. where he says
plainly. That as for now / though I come by you yet will I not se you. Since
Paul then so fa^thful an ouerse^r cared so miche for their salvation / knowing
that they yet wa^ ted trouthes necessary for it / came so nighe and turned not
in / seeing that th^i should be damned if they believed not these trowthes / who
would think that he had yet certain necessary truths contained in these
wordis. Cetera etc. but would have come in and preched them? Think ye that
since he could not come himself but sent th em this Pistle that he would have
left ou te these necessary trowthes? Misconstre not therefore Paul nor holy
scripture / and specially this text / As for other thingis I shall dispose etc.
which he spoke of ^twarde ^sages rytes and comely ordyr in the church and
congregation of god that it should be so well and comely disposed and ordered
that nether their enymes nor the Iwes co ude find any fault at their religion.

^ ^he third text which he wresteth Moris third shore
and wryeth for his vngra^iouse heresy / is in the last line and last chap.
of Johan Saying. ^ her a^ also yet many other things which Jesus did / which
if every one were written / I think the world could not co^tayne the bokis.
Here More noumberth his unwritten verites among these so ma ny other thingis
which christ did / orels this text could make nothing for him. but thou
know well that Moris unwritten verites. that our lady was assumpte body and
soul praynge to postis sto^^s and say ^tes / halowinge of vestmentis chalices
bo kis b^ll^s bows and crepinge to the cross these did Christ never / except
More had some reuclacion / with his holy maid of kent^ / by saint Johan
tellinge them that these were the things that Christ did and be not written.
But had More turned bake over the lefe / in to the last end of the Chapter
before / he should have seen Johan to have declared himself / saying. Many
other miracles did Christ in the sight of his Disciples which are not written in
this book / but these are written as sufficent for your belief / yt Jesus
Christ is y^ son of god and yt y^ beleuers of this / might have life
everlasting by his name. Here may y^ se y^ saint Joan was better learned
then More and knew what miracles and what doctrine was necessary for our
salvation / and omitted nothing of either of the in his Gospel: but wrote us a
sufficient and perfect Gospel for our salvation and did knyt^p y^ some of our
salvation in these few wordis as he does often time before especi ally in y^.
iij. cap. v. and. vi. etc. saying / he yt believes in me has life
everlasting. And if More would say yt he left us out any necessary troth /
so would he make sa^nt Iohans Gospel an imperfect and insufficient Gospel: but
More belyke mistrusteth his part and defends it with a naughty conscie^ ce.
For in this text where Joan says. Su^t autem and a^^a multa que fecit Jesus.
he wol de make fecit to signifye docuit or predicauit / as though s^y^t Joan
knew not y^ dif ference between facere and docere / ^ is / bet wene doing of
miracles / and preching his gospel as well as More: and could not speak and
write his propi^ terms for each better than More can tell him. And Saint ^uke
consyderinge ye difference between fa ^ere and docere / and y^ y^ hole story of
crystis ^yfe stood upon these t^^^ / yt is to wit in do ^nge miracles and
teching his doctrine: begane y^ Acts of y^ Apostles thus. In my fir ^te
treatis (dear friend theophilus) I have written of al yt Jesus begane both to
do and teache. Here / besydis y^ ^^ke expresses y^ difference between crystis
dedis and his doctrine / he says he has written of all things yt he begane
both to do and teache etc If he wrote of al (meaning all things necessary for
our salvation / for I think ^uke would not write no vain thingis) why sa ith
More / Every necessary thing for our soul health is not written? and thus of
his own false supposicio^ would thruste in his ^nwryten verites or rather
star^e lies. Thus maiste y^ se clearly (christian reder) with what conscience this
man writes and defendethe his part / and how falsely he peruerteth goddis
holy word to prove his heresies. Here he will have ye doing and y^ workinge of
christ in doing his miracles as both Joan and Luke declare it / and y^ word
self signifies / to signifye crystes techinge and preching of his gospel. And
where Paul said plainly he would set in order other things when he came / he
wresteth the word contrary unto all the hole process and effect of both
Paulis Pistles to signify to preche and to teache things that he never wrote.
And where Christ said the holygoste should ^ede them into all truths
concerning siche trouthes as were contained in the scriptures of himself /
being that fountain of al truth / which trouthes were then so hard that
their weakness might not ^ere them as was the calling in of the Gentyles /
which when Christ was risen he taught them / and the holygost comen also
taught them the same / and even straigth they preched them: yet would More
contra^y to al these manyfeste scriptures and evident profes / make them his
unwritten verites / as halowinge of bows salt etc. and crepinge to the cross
/ and that is yet more to be detested and aborred / he would have these
popisshe ceremones / necessary t^owthes to be believed for our salvation. And
now let us se his last text / alleged of paul. ij. Thessalo. ij. His. iiij
shore 1. co. iiij mat. ^^ij


And at last he belyethe paul agene that faithful disposer and layer forth of
goddis scripture like that rightwyse writer to promoue the kingdom of heaven /
sayng that he taught the Thessalonyes many th ingis by mouth that were never
written / bringinge for him this text. Stand brethren ij. these. ij
and hold the institucions which ye have learned / whither it was by my
sermons or by my Pistle. which text god knows makes nothing for his
ungraciouse purpose. For by these wordis it may stand well enough that he
both preched and wrote them al one gospel: o^ preched unto them no another wise
then it was written. And for because More is not so wise nor yet so well learned
as he would a^er^. I shall send him unto Paulis sermons which he preched unto
the Thessalonyes when he converted them that he may se what Pa ule taught them
and what enstruccions he taught them by mouth and whether his sermons were no^
written in the scripture. These institucions which Paul first taught them when
he converted them to the gospel More may read them in the. xvij. chap. of the
Actis of the Apostlis where ^u ke his companyo^ in this message thus wry teth.
As they made their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to
Thessalonica wherewas a synagoge of the Iwes / and Paul aftir his wont manner
went in among them / and. iij. sabbat days declared them of the scriptures
(scriptures says Luke and not Moris unwritten verites) openinge and alleginge
that christ mu ste needs have suffered and risen agene from death. And that
this Jesus was Christ (said he) whom I preche unto you. ^^ke and these be not
the same written verites y^ christ after his resurreccion / and the holy ghost
did led them into. Luke. xxiiij. Act. ij. And aftirwarde in the same chap. The
no bles of the Thessalonyes that had received Paulis sermons with alredynes of
mind did daily search the scriptures / the scri ptures says Luke / to se
whither it was so as Paul had enstructed them or no. whose fervent spirit and
erneste diligence in so serchinge the scriptures Paul remembringe / i. these. v
exhorted them saying. Quench not the spirit / neglecte not thinterpretacio^s
of scriptures / prove althinges and hold that at good is. He exhorted them
here to prove every mannis doctrine no another wise then they proved his daily
serchinge the scriptures to se whither there doctrine ag^^ eid with them. Lo. M.
More here may ye se / if ye had red so far / whether Paul did institute the
Thessalonyes in the faith with out scriptures / and whether his sermons were
not written and contained in y^ scripture. Me thinkethe since ye be so far
ouersene in holy scripture nor cannot confer the placis thereof together /
orels understand them not / ye had done wisely to have acknowleged your
ignorance and have left this labor in writing to other men As ye told one man
(whose name I could tell you) that ye left the office of the chauncelership for
that it was so laborouse and ^ayserlesse: that ye might more quyetly write
agenste heretykes: so had ye done wyse^y to have resygned your wrytinge to the
bisshops as better learned in the scriptures: and your self to have taken and
cast a syrples upon your back and stepped into the qu^re like a clerk and
songen us a verse of course or red us a lesson at the lecterne like a man / or
else if ye can handel a payer of orga^ns to have gone and played us: hostis
Hero^es impie etc. While M. Herrye your fool ^ad blown A solis ortus cardine.
And th^s might ye well have mayntayned godd^s holy service in chelsai church /
and let never a sowter meddle above the boat nor pre^^me farther then the
shapinge of a shoo. But let us examyn your high lerninge o^ rather refute your
false peruertinge of wother Paulis holy saynges.

Paul proves constantly and manif ij. tim. iij
estly. That the scripture is mighty enough and sufficient to ^nstruete and
bring us un to that salvation which comes through faith in Jesus christ /
writing on this manner unto ^imothe saying. But thou / se that thou abydest
fast in these thingis which thou have learned and ar committed unto the
knowinge and being suer of whom thou art learned / and that even of a child
thou have known the holy scriptures which are mighty enough to enstructe the
unto that salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus. For all the
scripture enspyred by god is profitable to teache / to conuin ce / to correcke
and to enstructe a man in r^ghtwisnes (that is / to enstructe him / when by /
and how he shall be justified before god / so that the man of god might be
perfait and redye to do al good workis. But lord how More adds to / how he
mynseth minessheth mangleth and potteth out this text with his false gloses
to wreste it unto his perniciouse purpose. whose falsehed th ou may se in
the. ccc. iiij. face of his confutacion in the. iij. book. where he thus
writes. Moreover it is to be considered / that Paul says not to Timothe.
Ab^de in th ose thingis that I have written but in those thingis that thou have
learned. As though what so ever Timothe had learned for his own and other
mennis salvation could not have been written to: and as though what Paul had
lernerd him / it had been no where written: and so to have taught Timothe certain
doctrine to preche / of which nether Paul nor Timothe had not to give their
hearers a rekeninge out of the scripture. Is this a good Argument / M. More /
Thou have learned it / ergo it is not written? And then does More patche to
Paul / his own gloss saying. Abide in those things that thou haste learned /
either in scripture orels otherwise of me with out scripture as he wrote to the
Thessalonyes Observe ye my preceptis etc. Now look christian reder whether Paul
wrote these worcester dis to Timo. either in scripture orels other wise etc. as More
falsely sewethe them to: but that rather it follows into Moris co^ fusion /
That Timothe eue^ of a child had known the holy scriptures which are mighty
enough says Paul and able to enstructe him unto that salvation which comes
through faith in Christ / but this text More glaunceth over here / to bring
in another for his wyked purpose which I shall a none confute. But Paul
tells Timothe that he had been brought up in y^ i. ti. iiij.
wordis of faith and good doctrine which he had continually followed / which
were y^ lame and prophetis as here it apperethe / and not Moris unwritten dremes
which Timothe never knew^ / nor Paul never ler^yd.

Then says he in the. ccc. v. face. That saint Paul told Timothe to / that
the scripture was good and profitable to teache the faithful folk and to
reprove heretykes / if he joined therewith always the faith of christ / with
out which it would do him no service for all that he had been learned theryn
from his chyldhed. Now Christian reder look whither More has trwly recy ted
Paul / look what he has putto of his own / and what he has taken from him.
Look and these be not rather Paulis wordis folowinge. For all the scripture
written by thinspiracion of god / is profitable to ^eche to convince to correct
and to enstructe in rightwysnes that the man of god might be redye to al good
workis. Now com pare this text with Moris allegacion / and consider well
wherefore he leueth out a great part of Paulis wordis to thrust in his own.
More leuethe out that it was written by the inspiracion of God \ and puttethe
in to that place / to reprove heretykes if he joined therewith always the faith
of Christ / meninge by the faith of Christ (as his own wordis there declare)
his own unwritten articles contained in the Popis Crecd. And for that at Paul
says. It is profitable to correct and convince and to enstructe in
rightwysnes that the man of God might be perfect and redye unto eve ry good
work. More clouteth it up with this patche. With out the which it woe lde
do him no service for all that he had been learned theryn from his childhed. Is
not this a faitheful handler of holyscripture? But M. More / If all the
scripture be enspyred of the holy ghost / so be we suer that it is trwe / and
may use it as an infallible rule to mesure to convince and correcke yowr
unwritten verytes there with. If all the scripture be good and profitable to
teache / why will ye not let men read it? why will ye then presume to t^che men
your un written lies? If it be profitable to teache to co(...)ce to r^buke and
correcke / why say you that it is the cause of s^dicion / heresy / and carnal
lybertye? If it be profitable to ^ustructe us how we shall be justified and to
make us perfect and ready to all goodness: what need we then your unwritten vanites
with your vain tradicions and articles of the popis Creed? which the
scripture as it knowth thez not / so is it plain again ste them. The prophet
calls the word Psalm. c. ^ ^^ n. Pe. i.
of god / the lantern to his fete and light to trede in his paths. unto
which light Pe ter bids us to attend as unto a lantern holder up before
ve walkinge in any der ke place / until the day be waxen more clear / the day
star arysinge and sprongenforth in our hertes / unto the which light / I say
poynteth us saying. If any man wa Isa. viij
nt light / let him get him to the law and sc^iptures testifynge Christ: and
go not / in thingis concerning life / unto deed spritis fay^inge them selves
to come from hell or purgatory / as did More of late playnge y^ proctour of
purgatory faynyng to have come fro thence with his book of the supplycacion of
soulis out of so hot cleansing fire / and yet was there not one lefe
shorched thereof. Aftir alyke fasshion More would Face ccc. iiij ij. Ti. i.
frame a another text of Paul / sayng y^ Paul writes unto Timothe before in
the same Pistle. Have thou the form and fasshion of the wholesome wordie which
thou haste haide of mein faith and love in Christ Jesus. He says not the wordis
(says More) that I have written to the and that thou haste read of mine / but
the wordis that thou have hard of me. ^o Christian reder / this is Mores
Argument / Paul says not the wordis that I have written and that thou haste
read of mine but the wordis y^ thou haste hard of me / ergo it must nedis
follow that they were not written. But I ask More whither Paul did not write a
Pistle to Timothe before he wrote him these wordis contained in his second
pistle? and then / whither that a man here not from his friend which
receives letters from him* as now had Timothe received a pistle before
contayninge the hole some of all holse me doctrine? And whether this be then a
good argument / Thou haste hard word from me / ergo I wrote not unto ye? More
argues (I tell you) very subtyly / as though what so ever were hard could
not be written to. Like arguments he makes in other places / saying. God
promised ^^lxxvij side
his law to be written in mennis hartis ergo it is not / nor was not then
written in bokis. which promise is in Ieremye. xxxi long aftir the law was
written by Moses. David said / thy law is written in my Psalm. xl
heart / ergo aftir More / it was not then wr yten in Moses bokis. And again God
promised not that theuangelistis and apostles should write the new Testament /
ergo they did not write it. And Christ bad his apo stles go preche the gospel
and not go write it / ergo they did not write it. which argu mentis how false
and fond they be even M. Henry his own fool can tell him. Paul i. i^. iiij.
bad Timothe attend unto redinge / exhortinge / and techinge till he come. He
said not / attend unto my unwritten word is which I taught the by mouth no
where written: but attend unto redinge of holy scriptures / even those wordis
of faith and good doctrine which thou have hitherto diligently followed /
being brought up in them. And what wordis were these? not Moris unwritten
dremes ye may be suer. But they were those holy letters / in which Paul
exhorted him constantly to abide: which he had been taught / and were co
mmitted unto him / and had known them ij. tim. ^
even from his chyldhed etc. as ye see. ij. Timothe. iij.

Wherefore Christian reder begin thou and read the first Pistle that Paul wrote
unto Timothe / and there thou shall se fir ste of al prescribed him this
wholesome doctri ne in faith and love: where he biddethe him preche and tell
certain men that they follow no another doctrine then that edifiethe i. tim. i.
godely through faith. for the end of the precept and pleasure of God / is
love out of a pure heart and good conscience / and faith unfeigned. And aftyr
a little digression / he says. That the favor of our lord has abundantly
excedid with faith and love which is through Jesus Christ. And then to put
timothe out of doubt of these wholesome wordis and Gospel of the faith and
love in Jesus Christ: he wyneth to saying. This is the most assuered and
trwest Doctrine / Word or Gospel / and none more worthy to be embrased and
kyssed then that Jesus Christ is comen into the World to save sinners. And
again in the. iij. Chapit. to setoute these wholesome wordis and that Godly
Gospel / how necessary it is to be preched in the con gregacion / how f^rme /
how suere a troth ^^ sy
it is / he said. These things do I write unto the (here may ye se whether
that do ctrine in faith and love that Timothe hard of paul was not written to)
These thin gis do I write unto the: trustinge to come ^
short^ly unto the / but if it be long / yet do I write the these thingis /
that thou may know how to behave thy self in the congrega^ion of the lyuinge
god. where yet to certify Timothe more ernestely of the f^rme and assuered
troth of this wholesome do ctryne / he calls it the very pyller and foun
d^tion of the truth / which ferme assueraunce ^e sets by this wholesome
doctrine almost in every place that he remembers it / it ye diligently mark
it in redinge his pi stles to these two overseers and curats Ti mothe and
T^tus. aftir this he calls this By this name he calle*th it.
wholesome doctrine or Gospel / that same great secret and dep^ mystery of
crystis re ligion without controu^rsy noman to dou te at it / Even this gospel
that here follows / God Ephesians. iii 1. cor. iiij
is declared manifestly by taking upon him our nature / approved by the
testimony of the spirit / seen and ^isited of ang^llis / preched unto the
gentyles / believed in the world / recyued gloryously into heaven. This gospel
and ferme pyller of the tr outhe ye se in how few wordis Paul ^nitteth it up
to point his Timothe unto yt wholesome doctrine which he would have him to be
occupied in / prechinge till he came. Where in this Pistle and in all other ye
may se plainly that Paul and his felows / were in wrytinge and prechinge ern
estly occupied about thingis of more certaynte / verite / more nyere and
necessary for the glory of god and our salvation then be Moris unwritten verites
and balde cerem ones. But let us yet set Paul him self a brason wall agenst
all Moris blasphemon selyes made upon him / to over throw his pestelent
buyldinge / thus affirminge unto ac. xxvi
king Agrippa / saying. Unto this day am I preserved a live by goddis help /
to preche both to small and great / no n^^her thin ge saying / then those
thingis which the prop^etis and Moses had said before to co me / etc. Here is
it manifest whither Paul was so bold as to teache any thing with out the
scriptures.

Now sith the Gospel of Christ is that wholesome and f^rme doctrine of faith
Romans i.
and love / so often promised by the prophetis in holy scripture so plentuously
written of the four euangelystis / so manifestly setforthe in every Pistle of
the new testament: Is not this Godles man an enymye unto Christ that would go
abonte either to prove it unwritten to thrust in his unwritten verites in the
place of it / orels to prove Cry stis gospel and testament imperfect and insuf
ficient for our salvation? contrary to Crystis answer to the question of the
man seen mat. xix
in the law of Moses / which asked him ^uc. x.
what shall I do to have life everlasting? whom Christ sent unto the law of
the commaundementis saying: Do this and thou shall live. And Johan says who so
believe in Christ / has life everlasting. Is not this the child of perdicion
that thus pet^erteth the trwth written by the spirit of truth? But he thought
when he wro te these blasphemies that y^ lay pe^le shu ld read only his bokis
never to se what sh ulde be answerde: for that the answers were so strayghtely
forboden to be brought in to the lord / and therefore he lied as him lysted and
wrote what he would.

Thus also he peruerteth Austens sayn ge to prove the Sacramentis to give greece
in the. lij. side of the lef of his answer to Tindales preface / sayng. That by
the holy wordis of baptysme coming unto the wa ter / God cleanses the soul /
according un to the wordis of Saint Austen / Accedit verbum ad elementum / and
fit Sacramentum / which wordis he engleshethe not / but I shall englesshe them
for him / the word comethe unto the Element / and the sacrament is made. Lo
here is not one word to prove that Baptism cleanses the soul. Like manner
wresteth he al other scrip tures for this his heresy / for his popish
preisthed / vows and fastis etc. which all / the scripture knows not. For
there is none to prove us siche a shaven anointed order / nether their vowed
wyuelesse chastity. nor yet that al men indifferently must fast siche
prescrypt days lymited unto the choice of meatis / to forbere one kind of
meat / and to eat his belly full of a another that please him beter. But to
prove these Doctrynes of the Devil (as Paul callethe them. i. Tim. iiiij.)
More farethe i. tim. iiij
like an hasty frantyke droncken man: which in his furye fallen out with his
fellow at the table will cast at his felawes hed^ what thing so ever come
next his hand / be it candlestik / cup / pot or plater / as More now in
his dronken fury lassh^the out the scriptures at rouers and ca stethe them at
our hedis: whereso ever he* find these two wordis votum and ie^^ium. For
first he says that Christ made virginite a cownsel / and that it is a
perfecci on above the old law \ taught only and counseled in the gospel. And
when he come to prove it / he allegeth the old law / ^ the. ix. side of y^
leif in his answer to tyndals preface.
saying. Douete and reddite / that is to say vo we ye / and pay your vows to
your lord. A lie can never be so well cowc^^ed / but it will apere. A liar
therefore it behouethe to have a good memory. For how can these frame together?
virginite is cownseled / and yet this text here commands it / saying vonete
/ vow ye. It is a perfeccion (says he) above the old law cownseld only in
ye gospel / and yet would he confirm it with a text of the old testament to
be vowed in the old law: where it was nether coun selled nor commanded. But
let us restore Psalm. lxxv
the text to his trwthe. Thus is it written Now ye / and pay your vows unto
your lord God all that be here in this present congregation. This did Asaph
command spekinge unto all the people of Judah gatherd together in the temple to
give thankis for some victory given them of god. which verse if it were
understood as More so wisely allegeth it for his vow of virginite and his
wyueles vowed chastity for prei stis monkis and nonnis etc. then were al ye
Iwes their present married and unmarried / co^ manded after More to be virgyns /
friars priestis monkis and nonnis etc. But had this great clerk taken with him
the later end of the verse saying / Adferte formidali mu nera / that is /
bring forth your oblacions or gifts and offer them up unto the dread full
lord: then should he have seen what this word votum signifiethe every where
almost in the old tstament: he should have seen / as it is comenly in all the
prophetis / the later end of the verse expowne the be ginninge / as for an
exemple / in the. ij. psalm. Dotum
He that sits in heaven shall mock them it is the lord that scorneth them
and Mo re to. This Hebrew word Nedar / which is translated into votum /
signifies an oblacion or gift / as lombe / kidde / sheep etc. promised and
willingly offered to god: as it was prescrybed them in Numeri and Leui tico /
and not the vow of virginite. Asmyche makes his the other text alleged Eccle
siastes. ii. saying. If thou haste vowed any thing to god / tarry not but pay
it. which wordis when Solomon said them / there was no siche vows (as More
would prove by them) presupposed nor thought / but sich only as the old law
prescribed thez. Had the^ then made any vow of virginite with out either
precept or ensample \ they had made it of their own head / and so had it been
unlawful unfaithful / and a folysshe vow / as be Moris popisshe vows / of
which thus there speaks Solomon / saying eccle^s. v
An unfaithful and a folesshe vow dispieseth god / and miche better were it
never to have had vowed / then aftir thy promise never to perform it. So
serves tha^tor^te of I say this great clerkis purpose / allegin Isa. xix
ge him thus. They shall know the lord and worship him with oblacions and
giftis / and vow their vows to ye lord and pay thez. Herelo / is no mention
of Moris chaste wy^cles virginal vow / but only as the circunstance of the
text declares it / yt ye lord shul de sendethe egipcians a savior / who^
they should acknowledge / and so testifye their kn^^wlege with gifts and
offrances promised and paid etc. Like wise peruertethe he the text Ione. ij
of Jonas / sayng. I shall sacrifice to yt with ye voice of thankis giving / and
yilde* to yt what so ever I have promised / where ye may se yt ye vows
mentioned in ye old Testament be ever joined with sacrifices and giftis
testifyinge their faith obedience and thankis to god for victory benefitis and
deliverance / and make no thing for Moris virginite / except he can prove y^
Jonas making this promise vowed to be a wyueles priest monk friar cha non or
some other reclused vanachorite for letting him out of ye whalys belly. Now fith
More could not find this word votu^ in all ye new testament to prove this
perfeccion counseled only in ye gospel / but only in ye old / where it was
nether counseled nor co^ manded: and since he thus snatched out the textis at al
adventures wherso ever he fou^ de this word votum: I wonder me how this text
escaped him. Et mane vota populus Exodi xxxvi
offerebat / And the people brought forth their willinge offeringis in the
morninge / which text makethe nolesse for his purpose then it declares what
thing vows signify in the scriptures.

Aftir this / as he would have proved us his vows: so would he have picked us
out a preisthed with holy ordyrs / a sacrament to give grace / out of this text
of Paul unto Timothe / saying. Neglecte not the gift that is given the in
thinterpreting of holy scriptures / confirmed by the puttinge on of the handis
and autorite of the elder. In this text Paul exhorted Timothe unto his office
/ puttinge him in mind both of his gift in prechinge and of tha^to^ite of his
calling and sendinge. For proph^^y^ is ta ken here as it is in the i. corin.
xiiii. for thex powninge and prechinge of the scriptures. act. xiii
And thapos^le^ manner was / some time by puttinge upon their handis so to admit
and send prechers and overseers into their ^ure and office. For first known
that the man was learned / having the gift of interpretin ge and declaringe the
word of god / with ^i^he other qualytes as he recyteth in the. in. chap.
before: than because noman with out a dew calling and admission of his
elders / should thruste in himself into any cite or paryshe / it was used and
ordened of the apostles so by laynge on their handis to insinwe and certifye
the people of the abilite autorite and worthynes of their pastor: which al /
this puttinge on of the elders handis did testifye and signyfye unto the^: then
sample (I think) taken at Moses / so commanded to send and admit Joshua /
Numeri. xxvij. But lord how More m^^* seth this text to shave them out a
Sacrament of holy ordyrs and that it gives gra ^e. For first where Paul
says: Neglecte not the gift / there More says. Neglecte not the grace. Now
have Moris grace. Then because yet the text after the latyne Face. xiiij
translacion has not preisthed. More flitteth to the greek / saying. For these
places (meninge also the text. ij. Tim. ^.) show both the sensible sign of
laynge thapostles handis upon Timothe in making of him preiste: and also that
god gave his grace th erwith. And the first text shewethe also after the
Greek (in which it is w^^he the puttinge upon the handis not of a priest / as
the latin is / but of priesthed) the power and autorite that Timothe had in
giving the same grace forth unto other whom he should aftir make priestis. ^o /
now have ye Moris preisthed to / picked out of the Break / for in the latin
text he could not find it. ye have also that the laynge on of their handis
made Timothe a priest / and that God gave his grace therwithe / and this text
shows the power and autorite that Timothee had in geuinge the same grace
forth unto other etc. If the laynge on of handis made priests: then did Jacob
make both Joseph's sons preistis. Gene. xlviij. And Moses did put his ha^dis
thus pon Joshua. Deuteron. xxxiiij. and yet in so doing he made him no pryeste.
So were Leui. i
handis put upon their host and burnt sacrifyces. And Christ so used to lay
his ha^ dis upon the young chylderne / And bade his apostles put their handis
upon the syke. where every man may se that This puttinge on of handis is not a
sensible sign to make priestis. For then must Paul him self be twyse made
priest / once at the puttinge upon him / y^ handis of Ananias. Act cap. ix.
and again when the elders did put their handis upon him / in the. xiij. of the
Act. And Timothe was a priest ere Paul did put his handis upon him / that is
to wit he was an elder / not in age / but in sage grauite vertwe and lerninge /
nether gave god the gift of interpretinge scriptures (which More here
callethe grace) therwithe: for he had this gift before they did put their
handis upon him / orels would not Paul by puttinge on his handis have given
him that autorite and sent him to preche Nether was it the preisthed picked
owte of the Greek that did put her handis upon him / but the elders or elder as
it is in the Latyne / for the Greek priesthed have no handis / but the elderly
men have handis / according unto Paulis saying. I exhort the to store up the
gift of God in the / confirmed ij. Ti. i.
by the puttinge on of my handis / and not of my priesthedis handis / so f^yn
would More here pick out his preisthed This sensible sign therefore in
putting one their handis / preched unto the congregacyon be holding this ryte
/ certifyinge them that this man was dewly and orderly with i^ste autorite
admitted to be their pastor and precher. Also where More says / that this
text shewethe after the Greek / the power and autorite that Timothe had in
geuynge the same grace for the to other whom he should aftyr make preistes: I
wonder he is not ashamed. For though the Greek has presbyterij which More
callethe preisthed / yet of that ca^ne he not gather that Timothe had power and
autorite to give his gift of interpretynge the scriptures / or as he says /
the same grace which he callethe g^atum faciens / unto other / for these be
the gifts of god as Paul testifies. i. Cor. xiiij. and in ij. Timo. i.
saying. Ste^evp y^ gift of God which is in the / which grace and giftis it ly
^the not in any mannis power one to g^ue them to a another. For they be given on
ely of God the father by the holygoste for the merits of Crystis death. Nether
is the free spirit of God restrained unto any vtwarde sensible sign in gyuinge
his gyftis: but breathe when and where he lyftethe. He is mightyer then m^nnis
handis / than the wind / water or oil / and is not ^aiyed of them. He karyed
the wind and not the wind him. Acto. ij. And as noma^ Joan. ij
knows the course of the wind frowhence it comith and where it rests:
no more know we by any sensible sign the course and way^ of the spirit into
owr sowlis.

But this thing requires a longer dispu tacion: which I shall by goddis grace
prose cute in the declaringe of siche textis as I know the enymes of grace and
goddis glory shall bring for them to prove the contrary.

And in the mean ceason / because Mo re plays with fasting or fast as he
did with vows and preisthed: I will declare what this word Ieiunium (in
English fast) fignifieth according to the use of the scripture / albeit I
know that More abusethe the word taking it only for the choice of meatis /
that / or this day forborne aftir the popis tradicions / in which
fignificacion the scripture dampueth it and calls 1. ti. iiij.
it the doctrine of the devil. But yet for this popish fast More lassheth out
all the autorites at once in which is contained this word Ieiunium. As in
Leuitico and Zachari. etc. But the trwe significaci ye. xxiij. side of the leif
on of the word once known / I trust eve ry reder shall se how little they
make for his purpose.

This word Ieiunium / in Englesshe What fast is
signifies not the forberinge of one kind of meatis / and to eat thy belly
full of other meatis that peradventure please and feed thy flesh better than
those meatis whi che thou forbereste / as to forthere flesh and eat thy
belly full of good fisshe with other delicate whitmetis / is not the fast that
scripture commands / nor yet to forbere etinge / and drink till thou be
droncke^. The pore ploughe man fastethe better with a pese of salt smoked
baken and a barley loffe with a draffe of small drink / than the monk of the
charterhouse with his belly full of good stourgen / pyke / perch / carpe / with
his good white bread and mighty strong ale or wine. Fast in scripture
therefore signifies properly the sorrowful affliccio^ / heaviness / and
humiliacion of thy heart / whereof there follows siche sorrow that thou
forgetteste to take thy nowne meat / but instead of meat thou strewest thy
self wi th ashes / and instead of drink lyckeste in thy tearis with the
ashes to: here thou cutteste psalm. c. ij
thy clothes / thou fallest prostrate to the grownde / thou waylest / thou
prayeste. Thus is Ieiunium in scripture taken / so yt to farbere al / or part
of thy meat / to pray to weep / to go inclyned with thy head / to be
enspryegned with asshis etc. be the parts of fast and vtwarde signs of thy
very inward heaviness and sorrowful affliccion / which the scripture calls
Ieiunium.

The very trwe fast / is a temperat lyffe and perpetual abstinence from al
thing that may ^al us from pure lyuinge and sobrenes of mind / wherefore
comonlye watch and prayer be joined with this fast in scriptures. I do not
therefore dampne this holy fast: but hypocrisshe fast / boughte and soulde /
supersticiouse fast mengled with merits and spyced with ungodly
circumstances / contrary unto this tiwe fast described Isaye. lviij. And now
read Mores iutorites / and judge whither they speak of the Popes choice of
meatis which he would prove / o^ rather of this manner of fasting unto which
we be bownde. First in ^euiti. xxiij
the. xxiij. Chapter of ^euiti. he allegethe thus. And the lord spoke unto
Moses / saying. Also the tenthe day of the self vij. monethe is a day of an
atton^ment / and shall be an holy fesse unto you. And ye shall humble yourselues
and offer sacrifice unto the lord etc. And what so ever soul is not humbled
and suffers not affliccion that day shall be destroyde from among you. Here
is Mores fast called an affliccion Zach. viij
or humblynge. In Zachary. vin. thus is it written to prove Mores false fast.
The fast of the fowerthe monethe: The fast of the fyfte monethe: and the
fast of the seventh monethe / and the fast of the tenthe monethe shall be
turned into joy and gladness unto the house of Judah. Which is even the same
that Christ said / Io. xvi
ye shall be full heavy: but yow^ heaviness shall be turned into joy / And for the
understanding of Zachary / ye shall know that Nebuchadnazer brake in at the
wal^ys of Ierusalemyn the fowerthe monethe which was to Judah a great fast /
that is to wit great sorrow and affliccion wepinge and waylinge. In the. v.
monethe the temple was bre^te. In the. vij. move the Godolyawas slain / in
the. x. move the they had heavy tydingis / not a long time to return etc.
Sochat Zachary meant nothing less than the popis choice of meats. For this
mauer of fasting that Mores church command the by certain prescripte days
and choice of meatis was invented long aftir Zacharias time and after crystis
commin ge to / ye and one Montanus a great heritique / first presum^d to
o^^rat men and publisshe In y^ ecclesiasti call story. lt. v ca. xxiii^ ca. xviij
siche prescript laws of fasting: whom Apollomus all Ecclesiastical writer
conuincethe to be led of an evil spirit. And as form Mos^s law God limted no
man to that / or to this meat as does the Pope but in all the hole year he
consecrated but one day to false / And if thou wilt know what manner of
fasting god approves: re de the. lviij. chap. of I say / and there shall
thou se / that it is not the Popis prescript days in the choice of meatis: but
he there damneth and aborreth siche fastis and kno weth them not. But had More
ben as wy sem readinge the scripture as he makethe himself / he should have
se^e what fasting is / declared by Cristis own mouth. In ^uke. v
^uke: the pharisayes and scribes came and asked Christ why his discpples
fasted not and prayde not as well as did Johan baptists disciples. whom Christ
answerde / that ye cannot make the chylderne of the bryde chamber so long as
the brydegrome is with them to fast: but the time shall come / their
brydegrome taken away fro them / y^ they shall fast: This fast he declared by
a similitude to be affliccion / sorrow / and the cross caryinge. And to be
suer turn to the Johan xiiij. and xvi
places of Johan where christ told thez of his departinge and taking away
from them. look and he said not / be not trowbled in yowr hartis for that I
now go from you. ^eryly ^eryly I say unto you / ye shall weep and lamente /
but the world shall laughe at you: ye shall be full heavy but your heaviness shall be
turned into ^oye etc. here might More learn to know what fast is by crystis own
declaracion had he either wit or grace to confer one place to another and to
understand what he redeth / let him read Iud. xx
Iudicum. xx. when the childern of Israel twyse beten down of the Beniamytes /
ho we they wept before the lord and fasted till even / and look with what
fast the people in Mitzpah confessed and morned for i. re. vij
their sins. and how likewise the cytese^s of Iabes fasted when they morned
i. ^e gu^ xxxi
the death of Saul and his sons / how Dauyd and his men with him wept /
fasting till even / moorninge for Saul and ij. reg. i.
Jonathan and for the people slain with them. And no another wise fasted David
ij. re. xij
when he moorned for his son gotten of Bathsaba. But Morer* death the
scripture to rasshly and wrytethe to fast to know well what fast signifies:
as every man may se by his swyfte allegacions. for in th ese places and many
mo both in the bokis Psalm. xxxiiij.
of the kings / Esdra / prophetis and Psalms / fasting is ever taken for the
great heaviness and affliccion of a sorrowful humbled mind / so that oftyn times
they ^te no Ie. xxii^ ij. re. iij
manner of meat till night / and Nehemias by the space of two days. And Esther
with her Iwes moorned and prayde tasting another meat nor dunke. iij. days
and. iij. nightis / so that the forbering of the meat follows of the very trwe
fast. The propphete psalm. ^ij
saying. My heart was smyten through and dried up for sorrow / so that I
forgote to take my meat / here may se that y^ abstinence / or not taking of
the meat is not of y^ substance of the fast: britan accide^ tarry thing
folowinge the fast / declaring the very fast / as does prayer / we^inge /
doing on sak / sprinklinge of ashes / cuttinge of their clothes etc. And for
a clear descripcion of the very fast: read the. xxxiiij. Psalm and compare it
with the Popis fat fast in the choice of meatis. Also the fastes a^t. xiij
xiiij
mentioned in the new Testament are non other / but affliccion / moornynge /
and Iu. ij. v
heaviness / where unto is joined prayer and Mat. xvij.
abstinence etc.

As where Christ says. This kind ^. co. vij
of deuyllis gothe not forth but by prayer ij. co. vi
and fasting. Which text / for because Mo re obiecteth for the popis fast: I
would fa yne know of him where ever our holy fathers fast did ^aste out the
deuel? the deu el should sit long enough ere the Popis fasting should
decease him. And yet if he bring for him the castinge forth of the deuel out
of his ^waye holy maidens of y^s wiche and kent / then dare I answer. That in
the maid of ypswiche the Deuel pl aid but ^o peip waytyng his time and place
to stele Goddis glory and worship from him to bring it unto that old roten
post / almighty God so permittynge him to mock the unbelievers because they
love not the troth of his word / sendinge them siche strong delusions to
believe lies / that al siche might be dampened for not ij. these. ij.
beleuinge the trout^e. And as for his holy maid of kent / whose miracles /
reuelacions / and holy fastis be esp^ed and known to be delusions and
deceitful doctrine of y^ devil: I think / for all her fasting and prayng aftir
the popis prescript form / yet the devil will tarry in her still / till faith
in christ purifye her heart and so drive him forth. wherefore More should have
taken al Crystis saying together and not snatched owte a patche of the hole
clothe / as he is wont to do. For Christ first told his disciples that their
unbelief was the cause why they could not cast out that devil. And than he
declares / that who so will fight agenst the devil / must goforthe armed with
faith and that with siche a fervent faith that soroweth for her own feebleness
praynge: lord increase me my faith / I believe but help my unbelief / so
intent and given unto mar. ix.
this prayer for the increase of faith and la mentinge his own unbelief /
that he forgets the bodyly paumperinge and feading thirsting only for
spiritual sustinaunce whereof the just lives / of which fast it is Aba. ij.
written. Psalm. cij. for he that so soroweth for the lack of faith and pray
so fervently yt he forgets al bodily plesures and dili^ates / obrayneth his
petition / even in castinge out that kind of deuelles / sit they ne uer so
fast / or so long / even from our conception and vex they never so sore. And
th Mat. xvij
erfore crist^ setto that similitude: comparinge faith unto the Musterd s^de
etc. Than brings he in Moses and Aarons fastinges / and king Achabs fasting
and the pe ples fast in Esdra. viij. and Nehemias fast. ij. Esdra. i. And I
cannot tell how many mo. to prove that al these fastis were like owrs as the
pope have commanded / that is to forbere flesh or whyt mearis. but and if
thou read the textis / thou shall se fasting taken every where a like / for the
sorrowful affliccion / heaviness / wepinge and wayling etc. as it is said often
before. Also he says (which is most dam^nable) that by siche fasting they
obtained remission of sins ^eleace of more pain and purchaced the^ grace.
Unto which I answer that y^ wor^is purchase grace / than (as Paul says)
grace is no grace / for it is agenste the nature Romans xi
of grace to be deserved with workis / if of workis / ergo not of grace / if it
comes of grace / ergo not of workis. For grace and workis are so contrary /
that what so ever is given for the one / cannot be given for the the other / Grace
therefore (concludethe Paul) is given freely / and not purchased with Mores
choice of meatis / Also if we for fasting obtain remission of sins / ^ala.
ij
than dyed Christ in vain / as Paul concludes. Then he says that Achab
fasted to move almighty God to mercy and to withdraw his punysshement. I
answer / iij. reg. xxi.
as for Achab as the story declarethe was a wyked king and a damnable Idolater
whom achabs penance for fere of pain and not of faith
god thretened to punesshe / as he did in deed / notwitstandinge his
humiliacion (as the text calls it) which was not of says to obtain mercy
/ but it was for fear of punysshement as was Judas his repentance / and god
forbore the plage three year for Achabs humiliacion / but his fasting nether
purcheased him remission of sins nor yet made any satisfaccio^ as Mo re would
prove. For his posterite and he were wrecchedly slain and the hounds lycked
up his blowde / as God thretened him for slaynge of Naboth. So that Achab for
his fasting had his portion with the wyked in ^s. xvij
this life for a little space / that his hell might be the more greuouse aftir
his wretched end. and than after a long brablinge and vayn profes that workis
should deserve heaven / he comes to the Fasting of the Ione. 3.
Ninyuites / saying / That god s^ynge the Ninyuites chastise and punesshe them
self with fasting and other affliccions volontary done / did mercyfully take
quyte aw aye the great and greuouse punysshement that was at hand ordained by
him self for their sins and offenses / and so purchaced pardon by their
fasting and cet. But the text tellethe us a another tale / and says that
aftyr they had herd Jonas his prechinge: They believed in the Lord / and of
this belief they fasted / and God saw their Works as testymones of their
faith. Which Faith / it is that God beholdethe for owre iustificacyon.
Jeremy. the. v. chapter. saying. Lord thy Ge. iiij
eyes behold faith. The Lord beheld Abel and his gifts / he saw of what
Faith Abel offered them / And so / by faith he offered unto God a more plentuowse
Oblacion then Cayn. Hebre. the. xi. Chapyter. Thus the Prophet^s expowne the
law: and the new Testament expow nethe them both. Another Tyndal nor no man
else denies fasting as the Scripture uses it. but the scripture and every
christian i. Ti. iiij
man that knows the truth of Goddis word and have espied the falshed and
abominacion of the pope and his Synagoge / takes the popes choice of meatis by
certain prescript days for every man / for the doctrine of the Deuel: as Paul
plainly calls it. And it is the more Deuellish in that (as More says and
cannot prove it) yt by siche dedis men deserve grace / remission of sins /
and so heaven / which is iniuryouse to crystis blood / and a deuellisshe doc
trine improued and damned in every part of holy scripture. For although many
in the old testament fasted and prayde for some great calamite / other cast
al ready upon them / orels now at hand / or of a special repentaunte mind
for their sins / some times an holedaye / but seldem many days together: yet
was it not the vtwarde deed that peaced god / but the faith / whereof the deed
proceeds as testimony of an humbled obedient and faithful heart. God is the
insercher and inseer even of the very secret affectis of the heart / and aftir
that faith given us / does he judge and favor / forgive / and iustifye. Ye are
preserved and saved Ephesians. ij
says Paul by grace through faith / and this is not of yourselfe. It is the
gift of God / and comes not of our werkis / lest any man should glory and
rejoice in him self. Men Romans iij
are justified and forgeuen freely by the favor and grace of God / through the
redem pcion that is in Jesus Criste etc. After that Tit. iij.
the goodness and gracious love of god our savior apered and did shine / he
made us saulf / not for our good and rightwyse workis which we wroght / but he
saved us aftir his mercy.

But as touching the place of iustifyinge of faith / and merits of workis /
it is declared plentuously in every englisshe book late made / Wherefore I will
pass over and make an end / but first I must poinge my self with a breife
Apologye from a ^owple of lies that More makes of me in the hundred and xcvi.
leif of his long Apo logye. saying that I taught pursers son attendinge upon
me at London. viij. or. ix. days / my ungracious heresies agenst the sacrament
of the anter / And that two nonnis were brought into my house at Au^erpe: Whom
Johan Birte (says he) stale owte of their cloister to make harlets. But the
nonnes said plainly and yet affirm it that they came forth lest they should
have been made harletts in the cloister by a vycio^fe Priest called Sir Johan
Lark their stwerde / which by their saying was not mete to be chaplayne unto
nonnis / nor nonnes to have siche a stwerd: and therefore came they their way /
It is a perr^llous point for Nonnes chastity to be reclused in siche a cloister
where Preistes be to familiare and bear all the rule being at me all tide
bed and board with in the place. Nether came these nonnis then unto my house
in Antwerpe I take God to record. And as for dicke purser / verily the child
lay with me that little while and fetched me mea^ / whom I taught to say by
heart his Pater Noster / Aue. And Credoyn English / with the two Prayers
following in the Ortulus Amme / to say them in the morninge and evening / and
this / in good faith / was all the Herysye that I tawght him. I had beit an
vndiscreit Master so suddenly in so lytel^ space to have taken forth the
child owte of his Pater Noster unto the Sacrament of the Auter / seeing the
child was not yet of so full age as to come unto Goddis board: but this loud
lie / his M. More souked out of the boys botockis to feed his ungracious
affectis when he whipped him naked tayd unto the tree of his trowthe. And as
for my goodly Godly Pistle / which he remembers in his confutacion and
belyeth me thereto / I know none syche / except he mean my answer unto the
priour of Newnnahms goodly Godly Pistle sent unto his reverent Father then
bisshope of Lyncol^e called (I trow) bisshope langley. unto which if it please
him to answer me / I promise him he shall procure him self more perpetual
shame then immortal glory / if he be not all redye paste shame.

A Peroracion.
But now (Christian Reder) For a con clusion / to return to my purpose. Because
M. More is so temerariouse as to dare say and affirm that all trouthes
necessary for our salvation / be not written in all holy s^(...) so complete /
ferme and approved te stimones and Testamentis of God / faymnge certain (I mote
^cre what) unwritten v^rites necessary to be believed: Thou shall What Testa ^ent
is
know certainly that God almighty by the mouth of his Prophet Ier^my. xxxi.
diuyded the hole scriptures into two Testamentis / the old and new: where a
Testament is as miche to say as a promise a va^gyn or a covenant / whereby God
has promised testified and declared his Godly will and merciful pleasure unto
us / agreinge with us upon certain conditions written in the said Testament. As
first unto our father Abraham offeringe himself ^^. xvij
unto him with this promise and covenant saying. I will be thy God / for the
and for all alone sufficient: I will (I tell the) be thy god and to thy sede
after the for ever: so y^ thou walk before me / be perfect and pure. And for a
declaracion and confirmacion of this covenant: god certifyed him / saying. In
thy sede shall all nations of the earth be blessaed. I shall give the that
lord that swimniethe in milk and honey. I shall deliver the from thyn enymes
/ with an. c. siche other. By which testimones and promyses he declared under
what form and condition he would be theirs and owr god. For we be of Abraham's
sede and his chyl de^n if we resemble owr father Abraham in like faith. And
again as concerning our part / it is enjoined and commanded us to have no
strange goddis / but in him only that so mercifully assu^re the us to be owre
god for all alone sufficient / to believe / to cleue to / to depend upon / to
fere / to serve / to worship / to love with al our hartis soul mind and with all the might of our spirit / and our neghbours as our selves. These conditions
are inculked and expressed clear ly and plentuously almost in every lefe of
the scriptures. These do all the stories teache us / the law commands and the
Prophetis preche us them. Upon faith and love therefore stand both the
Testamentis: which two things if we observe / so walk we before god / we
live pure and perfect in his sight according to his will. Where upon there
follows owr salvation and life perpetual.

This Testament / because it should perpetually Wherf ore god commit ^^d his
testament unto let rs
stand: and because the Deuel espynge it to be so contrary a scourge to his
kingdom and was so besy fro the beginning to pervert goddis word when it was
not yet written addinge and puttinge there to when he tempted Eve (as now does
More shewinge him self to be the very ch
ylde of the father of lies to seduce the con l
gregacion and church of God) The heavenly providence of God did commit it at
last unto letters to abide unto the worldis end that it might standforth
agenste all stormey contradiccion of the Deuell / and his childerne / the very
enymes of the trowthe / not only to defend it self by it sell fe / but to
declare it self the very word of God and to judge and try all mennis vnw
ryten or written wordis whither they be true or false: to receive them being
con sonant unto it / and to estiewe and dampne them being contrary. This word
therefore xix. and ^xix
says the Prophet is pure and precyo wse tried above Gold or Silver more
gloryouse and rich / than any precyowse stone in which consiste the the some
of our salvation. Unto which we aspyre and prease through fire and water / and
contend to have it through a thousand perellis / wh iche word because it is
endicted and wry ten of the most benign and lyberall God we know it to be
the most absolute / full / and perfyt: whereunto no another may be added /
nothing may be minisshed. And agene. Because it was written of the most trwe
God: we are perfitely assured of the vetyte and certaynte thereof: so that when
all other wordis as Moris unwritten vamtes may be douted of / and called into
question: yet shall this written word of God stand still undoubted of / the
most certain and trwe squire to judge and to try all other by it: even the
pyler and foundation of the trowthe as Paul callethe it / in. i. Timothe. iij.
capit. This was written of the most wise / that it should be exact with owte
fault or error. It was written of the most almighty God to endure for ever /
to bear down all other wordis contrary to it and to stand fast even agenste
the gates of hell.

This written word it behooved to be brought for the by ^lere and perfect men of
lyuinge and of constant faith. whereunto first / Moses the most faithful
minister in the house of almightye God was chosen even to write and to commit
it unto letters theuerlastinge will of god techinge than by that written word
his flock as now by the same we be taught what is god properly as our capacite
may comprehend / which be his ferme decreis / How and in what thingis he
would be worshipped / what he approves and what he aborrethe. Which written
word to omit and neglecte / it is damnacion / to obaye and believe / it is
everlasting life / To add unto it / to take from it / or to change it /
(which al More does) it is great sin and wykednes. This scripture was
afterward delyuerde unto Joshua to be conserved / defended / and spread abroad:
of whom by succession other men receyuinge it unto the time of Samuel did
preseru^ it. And than began the prophetis to floresshe / and open scoles were
holden thereof / Than began this heavenly wholesome doctrine (as Pa ul^ so often
calls it) to be professed and pre ched openly. Not that these Diuynes the
prophets were the autors of this celestial divinity / nor yet added or changed
they any thing of this scripture and covenant which Moses had written: but
these men perceyuinge the dul^es: and blind ignorance of y^ world / did
dispute / expende / discuss and declare them the law and lerninge before
written and delyuerd them / and y^ same prophet christ so often figured and
promised by Moses / they began to open to show and to set for the clearly
before their eyes. Which prophetis gestis and sermons / as m^che as behouethe
and is profitable for us to know / be written in their holy bokis for owr
doctrine unto the worldis eude / as ar the visions sermons and prophecyes of
Isaye Jeremy David Dauiel etc.

And albeit sometime the study of these holy letters floureshed / and sometime
was y^ script ures ab ode ever
neglecte: yet was it never (the providence of god so prouydinge) utterly
omitted and lost. For when under Manasses / there was sich a slaughter of
propbetis and the holy bokis lay rotted / couerd with duste and eten with worcester
iii^. He. xxij
mes / yet was there Olda the prophetisse lef te / and at last the book of the
law fownde in the temple brought forth into light under Josias. At the
captivity of Babylon / were not many of ye holy bokis (as they be now) smyten
out of their handis / lost and brent with the temple? and yet did god reserve
then Esdras (as now has he reserved many an Esdras) to repayer and deliver
them again from perell that they perisshe not utterly. which was nolesse miracle
than is showed this da ye / to se the Emprow^ Pope and so many Kings lordis
Cardinallis bisshopes and the Devil to al agenste it / and yet magry their
tethes all / God by a few vanesshed pore sowlis thruste it into their realms
and sprede it into every korner of them. And here yet would More have these
lurkinge sort of heretyques show a miracle for their church / as himself
brings in for his church the maidens miracles of curtham street now known
for a false seducer / wh an God the very author of al trwe miracles has showed
one manifest miracle even upon More himself and yet cannot the bestely blind
ass se it. but what is this miracle? verily God has declared Mores high
wit and wisdom to be stark folisshenes / and confownded his high brain
and great lerninge / by these wretched begerly foles of this world and stark
heritiques (as he callethe them). But to return. Esdras (I said) was stered up
to restore and preche again the scriptures. And now last of al aftir many
yeris God by his everlasting cownsel has spoken unto us Heb. i
by his own son our savior Christ eue^ the same that he had spoken before
by his Prophetis patriarchs and Moses: which thing he declared in his
transfyguracion in that he calling to him h^ly and Moses did talk with them /
signifyinge the law and Prophetis to agree with him and he with them / and
himself to be the perfitende and fullfilling of the ^awe and Prophetis even
the very mark yt al they did shote at / whereunto al their wrytingis tended. So
that all the scripture testifyeth Christ which ever alleged it agenste the Iwes
murmuringe / affirminge it to be so ferme / that sooner should heaven and earth
slide away than one Iod or Title of the ^awe should perisshe.

This Testament is ferme fast and immutable / one alone everlasting. As there
is but one God / one lord christ the head of one catholic congregation / so is
there but one faith one flock both of the old faithf ul fathers ofiwes and us
one christian religi on ever to endure. Is there but one testament? how than are
there two ye old and new? In substance / there is but one covenant and testament
/ even the very same made to Abra ham and to us his sede / but in the manner and
form of y^ delyuerance and respect of y^ time they are called two. For as
concerning y^ thing self that god promised Abraham and his sede / the same is
also promised us. y^ ^o to wit. That god will be our god / for al alo ne
sufficient / and again yt we should be pure and perfect walkinge before him / with
y^ same precepts / as to have no strange goddis but one god only to serve fere
and worship in spirit / faith and innocence of lyuinge / believing him ^. Cor. i
to be in christ our only rightwysnes redemption wisdom holiness / one
satisfaccion for all one sacrifice ons for all and ever offered up upon the cross
/ one sufficient savior mediator alone in his manhed before y^ father for us
both god and man / with the hope of everlasting life of our souls and bodies at
last ^o rise agene. This was yt clear faith and religion of Adam / Noe /
Abraham / Mo ses / Samuel / David and of all the Prophetis and also of Joan
Baptist / Steven / Peter / Ie ames and Paul / And shall be y^ faith and religion
of Christ in all thel^cte unto y^ worldis end

But now consider the manner and form How y^ testame^ it is be. ^^
wheryn stands the dyuersite: how y^ same covenant was made to us both (y^
same thi^ ge delivered both to us and thez) which thin ge Paul espyinge said:
Al was given the^ i. cor. xi
in figures. But so was it not unto us. For god the father gave us christ both
the pledge promise ernest covenant testament and altogether the perfect
acomplessher and full fines^hed end of al / so yt now we worship hi^ present
paste and co^plete / who^ they had but in shadows and figures / or rather
waited for to come* ons to be their perfeccion. Wherefore here may ye se the
diversity of this manner and form / but ye thing self to be all one to thez
and us. For they had him in figur^s / we have him in verite / they saw him in
shadews / we have the body present in fa ith. They enjoyed him in vtwarde
ceremo nes / we worship him in heart and spirit / his spirit testifying to our
spirit yt he is our god and we his childerne. Unto this spirit Christ directed
al thingis and prepared the hartis of his to receive him constantly: yt whom
his bodily presence which might not long aby de with them could not led into y^
knowledge of him / yt is to wit into al troth pertaynin ge to y^ some of our
salvation: yet y^ spirit of troth at last should led them by y^ same way
into yt troth which said I am y^ way Heb. v. vi. vij. etc.
and y^ troth. Unto this end pertayned y^ sac rifices and pre^sthed of Aaron
/ y^ figures of cr yst y^ very priest after Melchisedekis ordina^ ce and y^
very sacrifice o^s for all and ever. Hithe ^to tended ye blood of y^ offered
bestis sprin^l ^d upon y^ iii^. korners of the alter. This fi gur^d so many
baptizi^ges purifyinges and wass^inge^ / y^ y^ blood of this innoc^t and pure
lamb Christ should wasshe and purge us of al our sins. Of this diversity in
y^ form of christ is del^^erance unto them in figu res / and to us in very deed
/ did ye father assuer and certifye both us and them to be our god: upon which
diversity also did spring these i^. names y^ old and new testament. The
father promised them to be their god / and so de clared himself to be / in y^
he delivered them out of so many capt^^ites / and so often from their en^^es /
geuinge them y^ land with so ma ny commodites and siche laws and ordinancis as
no nation else had. And at last he decla red him to be our god also and theirs
to / in yt he gave us both his own sone so often and so many ways figured in ye
law / now verily borne for us and given us which also has die ed / is risen
and ascended to heaven etc. so fult ^^^nge al y^ was wryte^ of him in y^ law and
pro phetis. and this delyuera^ce of christ by y^ father to us is called yt new
test^me^ or covenant in resp^cte of y^ old* where because y^ body was present
and is now present still in yt ^ye of our faith / it has abolesshed ye old /
ye is to ^yt y^ shadews and figures contained in y^ old How testam ents / v one


In Substance therefore only / y^ doctrine of Moses and christ is alone / christ
affirminge it ^o. v. Think not y^ I will accuse you before my father: It is
Moses (said he to ye i^ es) whose disciples ye trust to be / y^ shall ac cuse
you. For had ye believed Moses / so had ^e verily believed me: for he writes of
me (^o M. More he w^yteth of christ and not le^ neth nor speaks of christ by
mouth with out writing). If ye believe not his w^yting (he says not as More
says his unwritten worcester des) how shall ye believe my words? here may ^e ^e ^
crystis word is which he would* have had them to believe for their salvation and
Mo ses writing was alone: Paul confirming y^ same / sayng we have ye same
gospel prech Heb. i^^
ed us yt was preched thez / mening y^ fathers under Moses. But here More will
say as Mo^is ob^^^ci on.
he does often in his blasphemouse bokis / y^ both there is and our ^estani^^ /
both their gospel (if he gra^te thez any at al as y^ scripture ^ paul does) and
ours be both insufficie^t / with out his unwritten verities or rather vain ly^s
be lapped in to: unto which Mo^is false saying My an swear
thus I answer: yt in Moses law there were as goodly ceremones and yt of goddis
ow ne instit^cion as these of Moris chirches / and yet of them thus writes
Paul. The la Heb. vij
we (by y^ law mening those vtwarde rites and ceremones) brought nothi^ge to
per^eccio^ and therefore was it w^ake imperfit and at last abolesshed. Now since
Paul reputed sich ce Hebre. viij.
remones so light which god himself orda yned for yt p^ple and for yt time:
miche less ou ght we to esteem Moris unwritten cerema nes invented of his
Synagoge calling th em vlaphemously tradicions of the spirit of trwth / when
they be but tradicious of lying men / and y^ is y^ most blasphemy of al where
he would make them necessary trowthes to be believed for our salvation when we
se them before our eyes to be stark lies / and deuillisshe dortryne. also to
confute utterly Moris wyked obieccion and pestil^nt opinion saying y^ theirs
and our gospel wryte^ or y^ both y^ testamentis be imperfit and insufficient
for our salvation except we lappyn his vnw ryten lies to: ye shall understand /
yt christ departinge bodily from his disciples / and sen dinge them into al y^
world bad the^ preche ^ gospel to al men: adding / y^ who so believe it and be
baptized shall be saved. which gospel is now written of al y^ iiij. evangelists
and in every pistle o^ Paul Peter and Joan and also in y^ law and prophetis.
except More will make us any other gospel and so lat it be called M. Moris
gospel / crist thought his ^noughe saying y^ who so believe it / shall be saved
For crystis gospel brings us no siche bal de domme ceremones as halowing of
assh es sa^t candles clothes and crepinge to crosses but it brought us christ
himself ye only per fit and sufficient savior of al y^ believe in him of
which perfeccion plentuouse fulness in our redemption and sufficiency the law

enough for all yt obaye him / says Paul / was y^ ^ause of everlasting Heb. v.

more? Is not this body in whom al verites be contained Heb. xij and. xiij

faith: is not he ye very same histerday to days and for ever? was not Abraham
with al y^ faithful fro ye begin ninge and shall be to thending justified and saved
by faith only in christ? Be not therefore carried about christian reder with diverse
^ayne and strange doctrine not contained in holy scripture but invented and
feigned of anticriste and his faccion. ^ede ye sermons of the apostles through
their actis and look what gospel they preched / look whither it was not written
and whither the^ preched any thing with out the testimony ^f y^ scriptures? and
shall we believe Mo^^s ^are word who^ we know another Apostle nor precher? it is
verily a long way between ye first ca. of Genesis and ye last of apo call. and
many verites and mich wholesome doctrine contained ^^ this space. A longer way I
fere me tha^ ever More eth^r ^aded with his camel or did swymme with his mouse: and
whith^t al y^ trouthes into which ye holy ghost led ye apostles be contained
in this wide occean and deep sea I wene it passes Moris speculacion to know /
and mich more te^^er^^i ouse he shewith him self to dare affirm y^ al
trouthes necessary to be believed be not here contained / since he nether know
what is here wryte^ nor yet understand any one ca. theryn. What word of faith
in god y^ fa there / in christ y^ son / in y^ holy ghost lakketh in ye bible?
what promise what gospel necessary for our salvation and conforte have not y^
scripture? what commandment wants it? what doctrine other to exhort / warn
/ re buke / correct / or to convince fails in the holy testamentis? How many
stories and ensamples ar there setforth to teache ye knowle ge of god / his power
/ goodness / faithfulness / troth / and mercy for ye faithful? and again his fe
re / wrath / ve^g^ance / justice / and ingementis for ye ungodly? Is there any
vice either against god or man / but ye scripture rebuke and da^^ne it? are not al
y^ scriptures reduced to faith and love? and did not christ knitvp al ye law
and prophetis with this double knot of love of god and our neghbours? is not the
scripture y^ suer ancor of our faith and religion? Aet. xvi. what else did Paul
and Silas answer y^ keeper / ask inge thez what must I do to be saved / the^
Believe in y^ lord Jesus and y^ shall be saved? whal would More make us believe
with his vnwryte^ wordis? Is not ye old faith of our fathers Ada^ / Noe /
Abraham and Jacob wryte^ and commended so often both in ye old and new te
stame^t sufficient? shall More auerte us from y^ sue^ ancora^d undoubted written
word of god to his own vnwryte^ vaynetes? Is our creed and faith delyuerde us
in writing by y^ apostles which they did draw out of holy se riptures now so
insufficient / that we must sewe and patche to it Moris unwritten articles of a
new fownde faith? or shall we desyer M. More to make us a new Credo and cor
recke the old?

What think ye of yt most faithful minister Moses / so meke so studiouse /
so di lige^t and louinge to his co^gregacio^ committed to him yt he offered
himself to be blotted out of y^ book of life for their salvation? think ye y^
he was not as diligent to write as to preche them by mouth the hole some of th
eir salvation and al christian religion? verily ste ue^ called y^ wryte^ wordis
delyuerde to Mo ses in y^ mount of Syna. The wordis of life Acto. vij. The
prophetis which were so fer uent and ready to win y^ people to god being content
even to dye for their preching: were they so cold and negligent as to leave
out any thing unwritten necessary for our salua cion? The apostles the very
messengers of Christ as especially Paul whose labors and swet in the gospel
exceded al others to win both i^e and gentyle / being also ernest for his
brotherne y^ i^es yt he desyerd to be castout of goddis favor / so they might
be taken in: was not this man think ye as er neste and diligent with his pe^ne
as with his word to win y^ world to criste? Paul and his fe laws knew in their
time yt ye sown of their wordis were but slyper voices smytinge ye most
slyper sense to enter in at one ear and to go out with many at ye the other / and
went but with their bodis only for y^ time, but their wry tingi^ should not only
be ^erde / but also offered to mennis eyes y^ most suereste sense of al / to
sown thorout al y^ world for ever where theirselues could never come. They
saw their wrytingis (what contencio^ o^ scisme so ever fell) should abide for
ever to decyse and determen y^ trowth / and yt letters were y^ most faithful
and suerest kepers of their wordis and voices / They same also in their time y^
their sermons and doctrine / diverse hearers did diuersely report into their
scla wnder and perel of errors and false belief: wherefore to be suer and to
avoid these inconue nientis / and for y^ other fruits / they committed their
wordis unto letters. Joan preched (I doubt not) first against Corinthus and
Ebion ere he wrote / but to confute their heresye more suerly and more at
large: what a gospel did he write: even y^ brason pyler and founda tion of the
troth to stand^ agenst / and to bare down al sich heresies to y^ worldis end
But here says More / yt the apostles were not so plentuouse with their pens as
they were with their mouths. Whereunto I answer yt they were as rich and as
diligent with their pen / ye rather plentuo^ser the^ with their tongues. For yt
man which writes ^ thing with deli^eracion which he has spoken and preched so
often before / shall do it more exactly and richely with his pen then ever he
spoke it / since the holy ghost fail noless^ his pen then he did before his
tongue. I think Paul did setforthe s^nne / ye law / gra ce and y^ gospel ^
^^^nfyinge by faith only in his pistle t^ y^ ^om. with his pen or spoke it
while his scrybe did receive it: as rychely as ever he did p^ec^e these things
by mo uch. ^ow compendioise an introduccio^ in to y^ understanding of y^ hole
scripture yt pistle is / th^i know y^ have labo^ed and studied it. Did not
Crys^stome / Auste^ / Jerome etc. ^ryte their homylies and sermons more large
ly ^d clearly then they preched thez? And if we might fetch a conjecture at
the gentyle letters / I would argue: yt Cicero his oracious w^yten / karyed with
them more vehemence / pe^he / and power to persuade / the^ sp oken: although I
know y^ y^ speker and pronou^cer g^ue his oracion spirit and life. For I think
(and so did Milo himself) y^ if Cicero had said his oracion for Milo as rich
^ and as plentuously as he aftirwarde wro^e it: Milo had never eten so strange
course is ^he in Massilia. But let these co^i^ctures ^asse: and turn we to the
assuered certaynte ^f the written word / to be set against Moris ^aueri^g
vnwryte^ vanites which as they ca^ ^ot certifye nor set no troubled conscience
at este: so put they noma^ in suertye of salvation is does the written word of
god: except my man be so mad as to believe Moris ba^e word better then goddis
wryte^ promise

The wordis of god wryte^ ar so certain The un douted certainte of the scripture
^ they be bound with an oath of his own mouth weringe by himself / so yt nether
the techer nor the lerner of the^ needs never to doubt. And by this oath he
has assuered us of the same hrretage given unto our fathers ^braha^ Isaac et
ce. if we persevere in ye same ^aith and sufferance patiently tarying for it in
hope: setting before our eyes the same self promised hope who^ we taryfore /
Jesus cr^st the very troth of god and the self promi se: of who^ he assuereth
us so certainly y^ he ^alleth him the suer fast^ ancore of our sou^is. (the
grekis use the ancore prouerbially for a suer and salfe refugye / and for all
thingis that we trust and cleave to) Now what sue^er ancor is there tha^ goddis
written word confirmed by his* own oath / even his everlasting testament
written in crystis blood ratifyed confirmed and sealed with his death? un to which
testament says Paul Gala. iij. th^rought noman to add any thing more or to
change: which consyderinge y^ assured certaynte of this word and gospel
written / when he came to y^ penninge thereof to certifye his Timothe and Titus
set to preche it / laid on these wordis as hammers saying. Fidelis sermo /
certus sermo / indubitatus sermo. It is aferme fast and a suer word / cer
tayne and undoubted worthy to be approved and embrased al manner of ways / so yt
it is profi table to teache to rebuke to exhort etce. It behooves an ouerseer
says he to be glewed to this assuered and certain word by wh ich men ar
taught and enstructe / so yt they may exhort with wholesome doctrine and
conuinceal y^ again say it. Our gospel says Paul i. thessa. i. was preched with
you / not in word only but also with power by y^ holy ghost in great assuerance
and certaynte as ye know. For he say^ nothing but he proved it them by y^ suer
testimony of scripture when he first preched with them and converted them. Act.
xvij. and note well Christian reder when Paul comethe to this certain assuered
word of his gospel. That christ dyed for our sins: how ernestly he exhorts
these two overseers saying. These things teache / This i. Tim. iiij. and. ij.
i. Tim. ij. and. iiij.
command / These things whette and excercyse upon them. These monesshe and
warn them. And when he came to ye. iij. ca. ij. T^. to put him in mind of
this certain gospel and of thassuerance of whom he was learned ye scripture /
how effectuouse mighty and perfect it is unto salvation / a none se with how
meruelouse erneste obtestacion he adjured Timothe before god and ye lord Jesus
christ yt he should preche it: byddinge him to be fervent be it in ceason or
out of ceason: Improve rebuke exhort with al patience etc. Now cryste^ reder / I
obteste and adjure ye with Paul / before God and ye lord Jesus christ yt shall
Judge the quyk and deed at his aperinge in his kingdom / yt you cleue unto ye
ancor of his written and adsuered word / not to leave it for Moris unwritten
rytes and ceremones / forsake not Goddis certain wrytinge for Mores uncertain
vanytes. Believe Goddis undoubted scriptures: and aborte Moris execrable and
dampnable doctrine if you wylt save thy soul. What Christian man does not doubt
of Moris unwritten wordis or rather know them for undoubted blasphemies and
stark heresies? but of the troth of goddis written testament / no christian man
being one of crystes floche heringe and knowing his herd mannis voice never
douted / nor never shall. but is assuered that it is his everlasting troth
sufficient for our salvation. Which god give us grace only to read / to
understand / to believe / to cleue to / and to ps. cxix
hold it up before us the very light unto our fete / that we stomble not at
Moris un written lies and fall into his dampnable doctrine.

Amen.
