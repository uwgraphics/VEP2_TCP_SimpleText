Also the high authority he has over his people. And when he says, he
brought them out of the land of Esai. 1.2. and 5. 4. ezekiel 16. romans 2.4.
Egypt, and out of the house of bondage. He sets forth his infinite
goodness, and so gives a reason to stir up the people of Israel unto the
obedience of his laws: unless they will show them selves, both rebellious and
disobedient to his power and authority, and unthankful for his goodness. So
Romans 9.25. 1. pet. 2.10.

the tyranny of the Devil, and blesses us with his manyfold benefits, both
for our bodies and souls: the same reason serves no less for us then it did

will, defend and keep me, and provide for me that I shall Psalm. 34.9.10 mat.
6.32. romans 6.27.28
lack nothing, that he sees to be good for me.

Question.

What learn you in the second part?

Answer.

First, in that he is called Jesus, I learn, that he is the Math. 1.21.
savior, to save his people from their sins. Secondly, in that he is called
Christ which is anointed, he is a Dan. 7.14. luke 1.33.
king to reign over his Church for ever, and a Deu. 18.15. act 3.22.
Prophet to teach his fathers will perfectly. And a Priest to offer him self
Psa. 110.4. heb. 1.3. and 9 14.
in sacrifice, for the sins of the people. The which were figured by the
annoynting of Kings, Prophets and Priests under the law.

Thirdly, when I acknowledge him to be the only son of God: I learn that he
is Esaias. 9.6. romans 9.5. phil. 2.6.
God equal with the father from everlasting: and therefore able John. 3.16.
heb. 9.14.28 and 10.12.13.
to bear what so ever was due for our sins, and of power to save those that
trust in him.

Fourthly, by his miraculous conception by the holy Ghost, in the womb of the
Virgin: I learn that he is Messiah Esaias. 7.14.
and Emmanuel which was foretold by the Prophet Esaias.

Fifthly, in that he was borne of the Virgin Mary of the seed of David: I learn
that he was Heb. 2.11. and 14.4.15.
man in all things like to us except sin. And therefore Heb. 2.14.18 and
4,15.16.
is ready to have compassion of our infirmities, and to succor those that are
tempted, and to bear what so ever is due to us.

Sixthly, when it is said, he suffered under Poncious Pilate, was crucified,
dead and buried, and descended into hell: I learn that our Lord and savior,
willingly, took upon himself our sins and became a Galat. 3.13.
curse for us, that we by him might be delivered from the curse due to us for
sin.

He also suffered a most shameful death and condemnation before men: to deliver
Romans 4.25. and 5.6.10. and 8.1.
us from death and condemnation before God. He has been made a 2. Cor. 5.21.
sacrifice for sin: that through him we might be made righteous before God.
And has by virtue of his death destroyed the Romans 6.11. 1. Pet. 4.1.
power of sin in his members.

And he was buried for a confirmation of the truth of his death. And when it
is said, he descended into hell: I learn that he suffered not only the
torments of body due to our bodies: but also the torment and anguishe Esaias.
53:10. luk 22.44. mat. 27.46.
of soul and conscience to deliver our souls yea that he has humbled him
self to bear the pain and torments of hell for the time, for our salvation.

In that Christ rose again the third day from the dead. First I learn that he
has 1. Cor. 15.57. romans 4.25.
overcome death and hell for my justification.

Secondly, I learn to rise from sin, Romans 6.4. col. 3.1.
to follow righteousness.

Thirdly, by the resurrection of christ we have a gage and testimony of our
resurrection, that we shall 1. Cor. 15.16
rise again at the last day.

In that he is ascended, into heaven: I learn that his ascension is a pledge
to us, that we shall ascend John. 14.3.
after him thither where he is.

And in that he sits at the right hand of God. I learn that al power is
given unto him in heaueu and earth, and that he al Mat. 28.18. ephe. 1.20.
creatures subject unto him, and that he Romans 8.32.
makes intercession for us.

In that which he said: that Christ shall come to judge the quick and dead.
First, I learn, that he which Job. 19.25. math. 19.28.
shall be judge is our savior: and therefore his coming shall be for our
salvation.

Secondly, to the 2. The. 1.8. romans 1.7. math. 25.41.
terror of the ungodly that he shall be their judge whom they have refused and
despised.

Question.

What learn you in the third part?

Answer.

First, I learn that the holy Ghost, is very God Mat. 28 19. ioh. 14.26.
equal with the father and the son: and that he printeth in our hearts the
Ephesians 1.13. and 4.30.
promises of God made unto us in Jesus Christ, and bears Romans 8.16.
witness to our spirits that we are the children of God. And works in us the
Romans 8,10. ephe. 4.23.
hatred of sin: and stirs us up to holiness of life.

Question.

What learn you in the fourth part?

Answer.

First I acknowledge and believe that God has a Catholic, that is to say,
an Mat. 28.19. act 10.35.
universal Church: which is the number of Gods elect 1. Kin. 19.18. romans 11.4.
ephe. 1.4.
people, that he has chosen out of al Nations to eternal life, and Ephesians. 5.26.12
sanctified in Jesus Christ. And in this Church there is a 1. Cor. 12. ephesians.
4.13.
communion and fellowship of Saints, and true faithful people: all which the
Lord 2. Tim. 2.19.
knows to be his, of which number, I believe my self to be one.

Question.

What difference is there between the invisible Church and the visible?

Answer.

The invisible Church comprehends all the elect of God from the beginning of
the worlds unto the end thereof. And the visible Church are those that yet
remain in this vale of misery, holding the profession of faith and the
doctrine of Jesus Christ.

Now the marks to know the visible Church are, the true Math. 28.19.
preaching of the Gospel or word of God, the right administration of the 1.
Cor. 11.23.
sacraments, 2. Cor. ^.5.
and discipline.

In these words the forgiveness of sins: I learn, that both I my self, 1.
John. 1.7. reui. 1.6.
and all that truly believe in Jesus Christ, are so washed and cleansed from
their sins, and have them so forgiven in Christ, that they shall Iete. 31.31.
heb. 8.12.
never be laid unto their charge.

And in these words, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting. I
learn that these mortal bodies of the faithful, Job. 19.25. dan. 12.2. i.
cor. 15.42.
shall be raised up at the last day, and shall be covered again with their
skin, and shall be made like to the glorious body of Jesus Phil. 3.22. dani.
12.3.
christ according to his mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue al
things unto him self. And after this resurrection, shall enjoy Math. 25.46.
col. 3.4.
everlasting life with Christ in the glory of his Father.

Question.

By what means is this faith maintained, increased and strengthened in us?

Answer.

The ordinay means are. First the Romans 10.17.
preaching of the word, as is the showed before. Secondly, the true use of the
Mat. 26.26. and 28.29.
sacraments. 2. Cor. 5.5.
Thirdly, discipline. The Mat. 6.6. mar. 11.24.
fourth earnest prayer.

Question.

What is a sacrament?

Answer.

A Sacrament is a visible sign ordained Mat. 28.19. mat. 26.26. mar. 1.4. 1.
cor. 11.26.
(...) God to confirm our faith in the truth of his promises, concerning his
invisible graces, in Christ Jesus, with a mutual protesting of the honor that
we bear unto him.

Question.

How many sacraments has Christ ordained in his Church?

Answer.

Two, Baptism, and Math. 28.19. and 26.26.
the supper of the Lord.

Question.

How many parts are there in a Sacrament?

Answer.

Two, the outward sign, and the invisible grace.

Question.

What is the outward sign in Baptism?

Answer.

Mat. 3.11.
Water, wherewith ye party to be baptized is dipped or sprinkled: in the name
Math. 28.19.
of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

Question.

What is the invisible grace in Baptism?

Answer.

First, it signifies, that as our bodies are washed with water: so our Mar.
1.4. acts. 2.38.
sins are washed away, and forgiven us by the blood of Christ.

Secondly, it sets before us our regeneration Romans 6.3.4. tit 2.5.
or spiritual new birth, to be showed forth in dying unto sin, and rising
to newness of life.

Question.

What is the outward sign in the Lords supper?

Answer.

Bread and wine Mat. 26.26.27.
both of which the Lord has expressly commanded al to receive.

Question.

What is the invisible grace signified by the bread and wine?

Answer.

The body Luke. 22.19. 1. cor. 11.25.
of Christ broken and his blood shed for us, together with all the benefits of
his passion.

Question.

How are ye outward signs received?

Answer.

They are received with the hand, eaten 1. Cor. 11.14
with the mouth, and disgested with the stomach.

Question.

How are the invisible graces received?

Answer.

They are received only by Ioh. 6.35.53.54.55.
faith, whereby we feed of them, as of a food, given us of everlasting life.

Question.

Why did God choose those creatures of Bread and Wine, to represent unto us,
the body and blood of Christ, rather then any other earthly creatures?

Answer.

Because there are none other earthly creatures that can so aptly represent
unto our outward senses, those things that God would have us to learn by
this sacrament?

Question.

What be those things which God would have us to learn by this Sacrament?

Answer.

By the Mat. 26.27. mar. 14.15. luke 22.23..
breaking of the bread, we have to learn: the breaking of the body of Christ
upon the Cross, and by the pouring forth of the wine, the sheading of his
blood. And by the distributing to all that are present: Christ's Ioh.
6.55.56.57. 1. cor. 10.16.
communicating him self to all that will faithfully receive him.

By the eating and drinking, we learn: that as Bread and Wine do nourishe
our bodies in this life: So Christ's body and blood Ioh. 6.57. ioh. 15.4.
, do nourish our souls to life everlasting. And as the substance of Bread
and Wine, by disgestion passes into the substance of our bodies, even so by
faith, Christ and we are united with an unspeakable union, and made flesh of
his flesh, Ephesians. 5.30.
and bone of his bones, And that as of many grain is made one loase, and of
many grapes one wine: Cor. 10.17.
so we being many are one body in Christ, and mutually members one of an other.

Question.

Is the Bread and Wine tourred into the body and Blood of Christ?

Answer.

No, for if you take away the sign that may be seen: it is no sacrament, for
there is no sacrament without a visible sign?

Question.

For as much as the unworthy receivers are guilty of the body and blood of
Christ, and do 1. Cor. 11.29.
eat and drink their own damnation as Saint Paul testifies. What is
required of us to be worthy receivers?

Answer.

To examine 1. cor. 11.28.
our selves whether we be true members of Christ or no.

Question.

By what tokens shall we know this?

Answer.

First if we heartily Esai. 1.16. joel. 2.12 13. 1. cor 11.18.20.
repent us of our sins, by an earnest sorrow and deslation of the same, with
an earnest mind and determinate purpose to lead our lives Godly hereafter. Next
if we stay our selves and rest in Mar. 16.16. heb. ^0.22. and 11.6.
a sure hope and true faith of Gods mercy through Christ, with a thankful
remembrance of our redemptiom, purchased by his death. And finally, seeing in
the Lords supper is contained a token Esai. 1.17. mat. 5.23.24 John. 13.34.
of frindship and love among men, we bear bretherly love to our neighbors,
that is to all men, without any evil will or hatred.

Question.

What is discipline?

Answer.

It is, the orderly Math. 18.15. and. 20.
government reprehentions and corrections used in the Church proceeding of love.

Question.

To what end?

Answer.

First, that the name of God and of Christ Romans 2.24. tit. 2.5.
be not evil spoken of and reproched, by the evil suffered in the Church.
Secondly, that the good be not 1. Cor. 4.6. 1. tim. 5.20.
corrupted, by the evil example of ye wicked. Thirdly, that the offenders 1.
Cor. 5.5. 2. the. 3.14.
might be brought to repentance and amendment of life.

Question.

Seeing God knows whereof we have need before we ask: wherefore should we
pray?

Answer.

First, to stir up our selves to Psalm. 105.4. and 119.2.
seek him. Secondly, to Psalm. 119.41.58.76.
exercise our faith, in meditating upon his promises. Thirdly, that we may
discharge and unload our consciences in Psalm, 55.22. 1. pet. 5.7.
casting our cares into the bosom of God. Fourthly, that we testify to our
selves and to others, that we hope and seek for all good things Iam. 1.17.
psa. 145.15.16
from God alone.

Question.

What things belong to true prayer?

Answer.

First it is requisite that we make our prayer to God Psa. 50.15. romans 10.14.
mat. 4.10.
only through Ioh. 14.13.14
Christ, and not to saints. Secondly, that we be inwardly touched with the

bent there upon, and not carried away with any by thoughts. Thirdly, that our
prayers be grounded upon Gods Math. 7.7. and 21.22. mar. 11.24. 1. ioh. 5.25.
promises with full assurance that they shall be granted, so far as the
Lord does know them to be meet and needful for us. Fourthly, that we continue
Lu. 18.1.2.3. romans 12.12. 1. these. 5.17. mat. 15.12.
in prayer, although we have not our request at the first. Fifthly, that we
ask not those things that we think good in our own Iam. 4.3.
fantasy, but only that which God Romans 8.26. 1. ioh. 14. mat. 6.9.
commands us to ask of him, all which things be contained in the Lords
prayer.

Answer.

Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy

a Father and not a Tyrant, we are encouraged to come to him. Secondly, that
he is our Romans 1.7. 1. cor. 1.3.

Christ, as the full satisfaction for our sins, and that we may hereof have
full assurance in our consciences, that the punishment of our sins, is fully
discharged in Christ, and therefore freely forgiven us, as surely as we do

examine them: how they had profited. And in examining them, did teach them
further.
