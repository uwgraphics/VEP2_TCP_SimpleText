(...) uered his old bryghtnes / and shyneth so abroad now / yt even they
whose inward eyes be blinded with false perswasyons of man and couetyse and
vayneglorye perceive a twynkeling of this light. For they can not deny but yt
they have erred in many things and were fer wide fro ye square / how loathe so
ever they be to hear it of lay men / or of such as being good priests /
would feign call them again to his doctrine / who alone is the way / ye
troth and life. And what can be a more euydent token of ye hye indygnacyon of
the godhed against the church of Rome, then that this Pharao and all his
egyptiens be so hardened in their hertes, that they will in no wise receive the
truth and doctrine of him whose folowers they profess themself to be. Of
whom may full well be affyrmed the words of ye prophet David. Eyes they have
/ and shall not se. Eeres they have, and shall not hear. wherefore no marvel
/ for they are so drowned in the desires of worldly worship, yt where as they
should say with ye apostles to Christ, Marci. x. lo we have left all / and have
followed ye / they can not say (if they shall not lie) but the clean contrary /
yt they forsake nothing / but catch all to them self and forsake him.
wherefore the same prophet David fearyng this displeasure and great anger of
god fallen upon the papystes / and desiring the grace showed now to us /
prays on this wise. Lord make thy ways known to me / and teach me thy
paths. And why prays he so* For as he writes in an other place. Cursed be
they good lord that swerve from thy commandments. Now who swarueth more
from the commandments of god / the^ he which takes upon him to be an herdes
man / and a feder of Crystes sheep / and dryueth them away from their mete /
nor plays the good and just husbond of gods house / so wynge spirytual
things and repynge therefore carnal, but he repeth carnal thiges / for ye
sowyng of ye unthrifty cockle of most foul and abomynable errors / and
seducynge the people of god after his most detestable lusts. which word good
redar I would not yt thou sholdest think to be spoken generally of all
spyrytuall men. For there are among the^ thanked be god hyely therefore, men
endued with great co^nynge / wysedom / and virtuous living. whose works
according to the commandment of the gospel, do shine before all men to the
glory of the father of heuyn. Again thou must not so interpret my sayenges
as I should think it unlawful for the clergy to have any possessions at al.
Luc. x. every workman says Christ is worthy to have his wages. And the
apostle writing to ye Corinthyens says / who is he that serves in war at
his own cost? who planteth a vine and eats not of ye frut thereof? who
feadeth a flock and eateh not of ye milk of the flock? But I meaned of such
as have possessions and domynyons more like to kings and emperors then
spyritual fathers. not noryshynge with them preachers of gods word and their
nedy brethren, but for preachers of Crystes laws / they feed such as p^ache
their decrees. And the^ ye like Annas / Cayphas / Ioe^s and Alexandre / of
whom mentyon is made in the acts of the apostles forbid men to speak or
teach i^ ye name of Jesus / for they will not have his gospel taught nor
spoken of, which Christ would have preached upon houses. To read ye new
testament with them is heresy, which is no thing else save Christ's words and
his dyscyples. And for norysshynge of poor folk, they may^taine other, little
or nothing regarding them that they should regard / but even pass them by / as
our lord mencyoneth in the gospel of ye priest and leuyte / that were moved
with no pytye to socour the man that lay in ye way robbed and wounded.
Against such priests / and all such as by feigned holiness and hypocrisy
seduce gods people from his teaching and ye instructyons of his apostles to
their feigned dremes. Against the^, cries scripture in many places. Hark what
Hieremie writeh in ye. xxiii. chapitre. woe be to sheperdes which dysperple and
all to tear the flock of my pasture, therefore these words says the lord god
of Israel to sheperdes that feed my people. You have scatered mine herd and
thrown them out and not visyted them. Lo I shall visit upon you the malice of
your studyes says our lord. And Ezechyell in the.xxxiiii. chapter. woe be to
the sheperdes of Israel / which did feed them self. Be not herdes fed of
their herdesmen / you did eat the milk and with the wolles you were covered,
and what so ever was fat / you killed it. But my flock you did not feade you
did not consolidate yt which was weak / you healed not that which was syk /
you bound not to gyther yt which was broken / you brought not again yt which
was abiecte / and you sought not that which was lost / but you ruled them with
austerite and power. And my sheep were skatered abroad, because there was no
shepherd / and they were devoured of all the beasts of the feelde and
dysperpled. My herdes have erred in all mountains / and in every hy hill / and
upon all the face of the earth my herd has been all to skatered / and none
there was ye would seek them. Therefore shepherdes here you the words of our
lord. I live says is lord god. Because that my flocks have been made in to
rapyne and my sheep to the deuouryng of beasts of ye field / because there was
no shepeherd / nor the shepeherdes did not seek my flock / but the shepherdes
did feade them selves / and they did not feade my herdes / therefore shepeherdes
hear you the words of our lord. This says ye lord god. Lo I shall require of
the shepeherdes mine herd out of their hand / and I shall make them to cease
that they feade no more my flock / nor that ye shepherdes can no more feade
them selves. And I will deliver my flock from their mouth / and it shall be
no more eaten up of them. etc. Se here most gentle reader the anger of god
enydently fallen upon the bishop of Romes tyranny / and his adherentes whose
proud power daily decreaseth according to ye sayenges of this prophet / for
their devouring of Christ's flock. And se also on the other side the great
goodness of god toward our English nacyon / which has delivered us out of
his rauenyng mouth / and given us our head and herdes man our most redoubted
sovereign / whom he has made the very defender of the faith and an head
shepherd to set such herdes men under him / which shall feed us and not devour
us. Is not this a great token gentle redar / that almighty god is well content
with this gracyous and very fortunate marriage / which has sent us the light
of his laws sens that time and has brought us out of the thraldom of ill
bishops. And as he made king David keeper of his herd of Israel as it is
expressed of the prophet in the foresaid chapter / even so he has by the voice
of his people / chosen our most noble and virtuous king Henry to be head of his
English flock, as well in spiritual governance as in erthly domynyon. Let
here no man murmour as some do yet / yt his grace is elect to be hedde of the
church in his realm / no forther then gods laws do permyt / as who says,
there is in yt point an obstacle. For why should not by gods law our king
and sovereign lord be our head herdes man as well as David being a lay prince
was head shepehered to his flock of Israel? Now where can any of them find one
jot in scripture that proves their most holy father to be above kings or
temporal rulers? peradventure, they will bring forth for them, that Peter
said to our lord, lo lord here be. ii. swerdes and thereof infer / that he
and his successors had given to them hy power both over spyrytuall and also
temporal. In good soth this is a ioyly small reason and worthy to come out of
a profou^de sophysters mouth, even as who would say. If when the kings grace
rydeth in to the forest on hu^tyng / one show him an heart or two, ergo by and
by he is chief foster of ye hole land. Ad populu^ phaleras / as persius says.
Let them blere good sely pore sy^ple folks eyes / with these gewgawes / for
other men seith their lygyer de main well enough. what says Peter him self
does he ascrybe any such power to him or any other of his teaching. Be you
obedyente says he to every humayne creature for our lords sake / either to
the king as most excellent (mark you he calls kings most excellent, and
usurps no such title to him self) or to other guydes as sent of him. Saint
Paul says that all temporal power is of god / and he byddeth in diverse
places to be obedient to temporal princes. Some hystoryes also make mencyon,
yt ye bishop of Rome took not upon him to be head of the church till ye year
of our lord. C. x^v. Ergo then if this hystorye be true it is a false tale to
say yt this double power was given to Peter of god, seeing that neither he nor
a dosen mo of his successors (granted yt he was pope) took it not upon them
till one vyctor waxed so stout / and yet he usurped no te^porall power, how
that came in I report me to them. Saint Paul never said of the apostles that
they bare any sword, but of temporal princes he said that they here not a
sword without cause. It is meat for us then to give to god that is his / and
to our king yt is his. who as thou see has the rule over us under god and
not ye bishop of Rome. And hyghly we are bound to thank the blessed Trinite
/ that ye eyes of faithful people be uncovered to se the truth. wherefore I
confess that I was my self a great while blinded and went aside in the
counsel of wicked men. psalm. j. and stood a long season in the way of sinners
/ yea and sat fast in the chair of pestilence. But I thank our blessed
savior which dyuerslye calls whom he lift to him / he has uncovered mine
eyes which were blyndfelde with two foul cloutes of ygnoraunce and false
persuasion / and he has made me have an occasyon to look better on his
doctrine / and to perceive the error that I was deceived in / as Horace
says. specie recti. and thinking there to be right where none was / and
there wrong where the right was. wherefore sens as I trust I have escaped the
foul storm of false believe. For what shall I call else ye trust in papystycall
power. I have to ye intent to help other set forth in englisshe thept'e of
saint Paul to his discyple Tyte which techeth how much and how straytly we
be bound to obey next God our king and sovereign lord. For as he writes in
the. xii. chapitre to the Romans / who resists against them resysteth
against the ordinance of god. And who resyste against gods ordinance, they
purchase their own dampnacyon. Again if christen men be bound to obey their
princes though they be miscreau^tes, how much more be we bounden to obey our
most virtuous and christen king and lord / which so dyligently laboreth with
all his hole intent to have us the veraye sheep of Christ's fold and to
deliver us also / from ye danger of rauenyng wolves. wherefore no doubt but
god of his goodness will long preserve him and defend him from his enemies.
Beside this epistle shows every man both spirytuall and temporal, how he
ought to use him self, that he may after this life be pertener of that life /
whereunto we are all bought / and shall if we live well not fail to come to,
not by pardons bought from Rome / but by the merytes of Christ's passion.
wherefore I with hole heart and mind beseech the good redar if thou find any
fruit herein / as no doubt but y^ shalt, and that largely / endeuer thy self
as nere as god will give y^ grace to live according to saint Paul's doctrine,
and next to pray the blessed Trinite to grant me his grace to leave from hens
forth the blyndnes of sin and to live after ye laws of god and my prince.
And to thentent you shall ye better perceive what this holy apostle has
written: I have added to / ye paraphrase of Erasmus which shall make all thing
plain to the. The grace and peace of God be with the and me and all good
christen people. Amen.

The Epistle of Paul unto Tytus.
Paul the seruante of God and an Apostle of Ihesu Christ: to preach the
faith of gods elect / and ye knowledge of the truth / which truth is in
seruyng god / in hope of eternal life / which life god that cannot lie /
has promised before ye world began / but has at the time appointed opened
his words by preaching / which preaching is committed unto me, by the
commandment god our savior, to Tytus his natural sone in the comen faith.
Grace / mercy / and peace from god the father / and from the lord Jesus
Christ our savior.

For this cause left I y^ in Crete, that thou sholdest pfourme that, which was
lackyng and sholdest ordeyne senyours in every City as I appointed ye / if any
be such as no man can complayn on / the husbond of one woman, having faithful
children / which are not sclaundered of riot / neither are dysobedyent. For a
bishop must be such as no man can complain on as it becomes the ministre of
god / not stubborn, not angrye / no dronkard / no fyghter / nor given to
filthy lucre / but herberous / one ye loves goodness / of honest behaueour /
rygtuous, holy / temperat / and such as cleueth unto the true word of
doctrine / that he may be able to exorte with wholesome learning / and to ymproue
them that say against it. For there are many disobedyent / and talkers of
vanyte, and disceyuers of minds, namely they of ye circumcisyon, whose mouths
must be stopped which pervert hole housses teaching things which they ought
not because of fylthy lucre. One being of them selves which was a poet of
their own, said. The Cretayns are always liars, evil beasts, and slow
bellies. This wytnes is true / wherefore rebuke them sharply / that they may
be sound in the faith / and not taking head to jews fables, and
commandments of men, which turn from ye truth. Unto ye pur / are all
things pure / but unto them that are defiled / and unbelieving is nothing
pure, but even yt very minds and co^scyences of them are de^yled. They
confess yt they know god / but with deeds they deny him / and are abominable /
and dysobedient / and unto all good works dyscomendable.

The second chapter.
BUt speak thou yt which becomes wholesome lear ninge / that the elder men be
sobre, honest, dyscrete, sound. in the faith in love and patience And the elder
women like wise that they be in such raiment / as becomes holiness / not
false accusars / not given to much dryn king / but teachers of honest
things / yt they nurter the young women for to love their husbands / to love
their children / to be of honest behaueour chaste / huswyfely / good and
obedient / unto their own husbands, that the word of god be not evil spoken
of. Young men like wise exhort that they be of honest manets. Above all
things show thy self an insample of good works in ye doctrine show
vncorruptio / honesty and the holsom word / which can not be rebuked / yt he
which withstondeth may be asshamed / having nothing in you that he may
dysprayse. The servants exhort to be obedyent unto their own masters / and
to please in all things, not answeryng again, neither be pyckers, but that
they show all good faythfullnes that they may do worship to ye doctrine of god
our savior in all things. For the grace of god yt brings health unto all
men: has apered and teaches us that we should deny ungodliness / and worldly
lusts, and that we should live honestly, tyghtuously / and godly in this
present world, lokynge for that blessed hope and gloryouse aperyng of the
mighty god / and our savior Jesus Christ, which gave him self for us / to
redeem us from all unrighteousness / and to pourdge us a peculyer people unto
him self / fervently given unto good works. These things speak / and
exhort, and rebuke with all co^maundyng. Se that no man despise the.

The third chapter
Warn them that they submyt them selves to princes and such as have power
over the^ to obey their co^mau^dment / that they be prompte unto all good
works, that they speak evil of no man / yt they be no fyghters / but soft /
showing all mekenes unto all men / for we our selves also were in times past,
unwise, dysobedyent / deceived / in danger / to lusts and to diverse manners of
voluptuousnes / living in malycyousnes / and envy, full of hate hatyng one
another. But after that the kyndnes / and love of our savior to manward apered
not of the deeds / of ryghtuousnes which we wrought / but of his mercy he
saved us, by the fountain of the new birth and with the renuyng of the holy
ghost / which he shed on us abou^dantly thrughe Jesus Christ our savior / yt
we ons justified by grace / should be heirs of eternal life / through hope.
This is a true saying. Of these things I would thou sholdest certefy / that
they which believe god, might be stodiouse to go forward in good works. These
things are good and profitable unto men. Folyshe questyons and genealogyes and
braulynges and strife about the law avoid, for they are unprofitable /
superfluous. A man that is ye auctor of fectes after ye first and second
admonysshyon avoid him / remembrynge that he that is such is perverted and
syn^eth / even dampened by his own judge me^t. when I shall send Artemas or
Tichicus be dylygent to come to me unto Nycopolys. For I have determined there
to winter. Bring zenas ye lawyer and Apollos on their journey dylygently / that
nothing be lackyng unto them. And let ours also learn to excel in good works
as farforthe as need requires / that they be not unfruitfully. All that are with
me salute the. Great them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Amen. written from Nicopolis a city of Macedonia.

Here begy^neth the Paraphrase of Erasmus of Roterdame upon saint Paul's Epse
to his dyscyple Tytus.
I Paul my self the sworn servant and obeyer / not of Moses law as I was
ones / but of the law of god the father / and Ambassador of his sone Jesus
Christ. Of the which mine Embassade or co^missyon the hole effect is this,
that such as god has elect to euangelycal health / them I should exhort and
call / not to ye obseruacyon of ye old law / or to put their trust in their
works / but I must move the^ to faith / which only opens to all men ye
entry^g to everlasting life / thrughe the free goodness of Jesus Christ.

And my co^myssyon is not to call them to faith only / but also to ye knowleg
of truth which among the gentyles was ouerheaped and doluen in the
imagynacyons and feigned Inuentyons of worldly wysdom. And among the jews it
was had in shadows and wrappinges of figures. I am encharged I say to call men
to ye knowledge of truth / not that which ye philosophers of this world do
teach / dysputyng on the causes of natural things / but to the knowledge of
the truth, which compendiously shows in what things true christen living
is set / whose end and reward is everlasting life / following after this
short life that we led here in this world, which euerlastig life all good
and godly lyuers ought with ye more trust to hope for / in how so ever great
tribulations and euylles of this world they be. First by cause he yt promised
them this life everlasting was not a man that might both be deceyuyd him self,
and also deceive other / but it was god himself / which as it can not be
chosen / but he must needs abide still god / so can nothing surely proceed
from him / but ye mere truth. And again because this that he promised, he did
not promise it by chance, or now of late / but before that the world was made
it was fyxed and fully determined by ye deuyne and unchangeable decre of his
mind to do yt which he now does. There is no new thing come to his purpose
/ but that thing which for secret causes only known to the godhed he would
have hitherto covered and hyd / that would he have opened to all the world at
this time which by his everlasting wisdom he had before appointed to this
busynes. Nor he would not that there should be only showed to the Jews a
dark shadow of ye fygures of some blind thing and hard to be discussed / but
his will is to have a plain truth to be made open by ye open and plain
preaching of the gospel to all men, wtoute any dyuersyte either of nation or
tongue. This is the sum and hole effect of ye doctrine of the gospel / ye
p^chyng whereof I have not taken upon me of mine own head / but it was committed
to me and not by men / but by our savior god / who not only called me to ye
occupieng of an apt'es room and office / but also he enjoined it me / yea and
so he charged me therewith / yt it was not lauful or free for me to say nay to
that which he commanded me to do / which words I have spoken to thentent yt
no man should think mine authorite to be ^yhgt / or else their authoryte / whom
I have put any where i my stead. I therefore ye same Paul being in such
authoryte do write this letter to Titus my true and natural son / not by
bodily generacyon but by the sede of faith, which I have so shed in to him and
in ye which he so well resembles me / that I seem to be renewed in him like as
a father is in his own natural son. To him I whissh that there may come grace
and peace from him / from whom all very goodness does come / that is to say
from god the father and his son Jesus Christ ye only author of our health. For
in such riches, as grace, and peace are, my desire is to have my children made
rich. But to speak now to the my son Tytus, sith I did know right well the
nature of this Ilonde / and again I did not doubt but that they had need of a
faithful and dilyge^t creanser or ouerseer / I have for that cause left the
in Crete as representyng mine own person, because that the busynes of the
gospel calls me to other places / yt such things as have there bego^ to be
corrected by me / thou as my deputye may make make an end of the^. And
because yt thou alone art not able to ouerloke so many cytyes as this He is
replenysshed with / you shall ordeyn in every city an hedde priest or bishop as
I when I depted did did the / But beware that thou admyt no man to so hye an
office without great dyscressyon / for he must be a very proved man to whom
thou shalt betake this charge / and not all only of a known and testyfyed
honestye / but also he must be clear from all supycyon of any manner of fault
what so ever it be. Such a bishop or ouerseer to thent e^t that you may ye
better and surelyer those out / I will set him forth by certain signs / yea
and in manner paynt him to the. If thou know any man to be of such manners and
that vpryght living / yt no faut^ can prouable be laid to him. If any man
being content with one matrimony give no token of unchaste living / if he have
children so instruct and brought up, that not only in the knowlaigyng of
Christ's faith / but also by the innocence of their living they show them
self to be chryste^ me^ / that is to say not ill named for riot, as ye
common sort of young men be / nor dysobedyent to their father and mother. For
he that shall be counted worthy to be a bishop must be so fer wide from all
vice and beside that fro ye suspicyon of any vice / that he must mark that he
not only keep his own honesty / but also of all his householde, for the
fautes of the children are wont co^munely to be reproched to the fathers and
mothers. Now what soever hurts ye good name of a bishop / it turns to ye
sclau^der of the gospel of Christ. It is necessary therefore yt he which in a
manner stondeth in gods stead / and to whom ye treasure of the teaching of ye
gospel as to a chosen dispe^ser thereof is committed be in all points without
blame / and a great way from the vices of them which co^munely here offycys /
that they which be under him, may be under him wyllyngly, and with all the heart
in their body. He must look upon nothing but the soul health of the flock
that is betaken to him / he must study to amend and not to oppress / to
teach not to compel, to lead and not to draw / he must persuade rather then
calling for duty / he must ouercom more by benefits and sufferaunce / then
by lordlynesse and hy spyryte. He that shall occupye this rome I say must not
be stubberne / (...) angry / nor hasty i^ speking / (...) which things men
will sooner withdraw their hertes then follow any doctrine, he must also in any
wise beware of couetyse and gapynge after lucre for that thing is vile and
pestylent in any lay offycer, and much more to be abhorred in a bishop or
any spyrytuall man. For he that is infecte with the vice of auaryce does
nothing vpryghtly, and as of equity it should be done. A bishop must beside
these be sober, just in innocence of life, virtuous and godly in the
obseruacyon of Christ's faith and relygion of the gospel, not subject to any
ill affections, but far above all such desires by which the commune sort of
men are led up and down. But chefyly he must be a steadfast holder of the
words of ye gospel, wherein he is bound to (...) ^ell instruct / that he may
teach such as be ignorant in those things that perteyne to their soul
health, and that he may with holsom doctrine exhort and call forward them
that are slow and repreue them yt speak against the truth. I do not warn the
of these things causeles / for there be many waywarde parsons / brabelers and
deceyuers of men's minds / which not geuyng an eere to the teaching of ye
gospel, bry^g i^ stead of it vain and unprofitable fables of ye jews, whereby
they may get them a name of lernyng among ye people, and winning also. And by
these fables they entise ye minds of some simple folk and begile them
crawlyng under the color of the gospel in to the minds of their herars, in
so much y^ many times they corrupt not one or two, but they ouert^ne hole
householdes and kynredes, teaching shameful things / and far square from the
verite of ye gospel. And yet for all yt they abuse the title of the gospel to
the lucre / which vilanously they daily hunt after / wherefore se yt you rebuke
them sharply and shyt their mouths. There be some of the gentyles yt be
combred with this enormyty / but specially you shall find them of this
malicious sect, which be jews converted to Christ, which untruly teach the
gospel / menglynge always there with ye laws of moses, and will not leave in
any wise the false superstition of the jews. And it is no marvel to have
such men found in Crete, that feed their belies with brabelyng and naughty
ways / sythen mani years agone Epimenides the poet, which was him self a
man of Crete, did speak of them / which words were these, Men of Creete be
always liars / ill beestes / and slothful belyes which wytnes is so true yt
it may seem well enough to be spoken of gods own mouth. Be not they
natural liars which fere not to darken the most clear light of the truth of
the gospel with their fables. Be not they noyfull beasts which in every
place blow their venom on simple persons / that be not ware of them. Be not
they slothful belyes, which had lever by false doctrine to live in Idelnes
and rankly, then for ye defense of the gospel to live in hungre, and be
shrewdly handled many times as we be? werfore rebuke such naughty packes
ernestly, yt they may amend / and leuyng the trust that they have in the
ceremonies of ye old law / they maigeue them self holy to the truth of ye
gospel. And that they give not their eeres to such unthrifty tales of the
Jews / thrughe the which the precepts of Christ are let go / and
constytutions of men are brought in / of the observations of new mones / of the
kepynges of the sabbot / of cyrcumcisyon / of wasshynges / of choice of meats
/ of clothing, of certain things that may not be touched / of the house seven
days unclean, and other like to these, which god for a time commanded to be
kept of ye Jews / partly that that nacyon being rebel and vnweyldy to be
ordered / might be holden and kept under by the multitude of precepts or
commandments / partly that these things should be as shadows of true
things that were to come. But they are now utterly of none effect so much yt
if any man will contynew still to observe these thiges after the manner of ye
Jews / nothing can turn them more from the verite of the gospel. For there
is no nation yt more stubbernely does rebel against ye gospel / tha^ ye Iues
do / which can in no wise leave these folyshe tryfles. This meat (say they)
is unclean eat it not. This body is vncleene touch it not / hens away with
these dyuer sytees among Christen men / to whom as they be clean / all
things are clane / nor they should abhor nothing yt god has made for ye
use of man. And as to them yt be pure christian men / nothing is impure or
unclean, so to ye Jews whose minds are filthy and unclean, nothig is clean,
not so much as they that ye old law suffers and does permyt as clean, for
seeing they mystrust him which after the openyng of the gospel would have all
these things not observed after ye fleshly and litterall sense, but to be
referred to the business of the soul. what thing can be pure to them, whose
mind are spotted and infecte with mistrust / and their living defiled with
inordinate wast / ambytion, couetise, and other vices. They uphold the law
with to the and nail / and yet they wot not what the law means. They have
their p^puce circu^cysed / but ye mind wtin is uncircumcised. They go i to ye
temple with ho^des and fete washed, but ye soul and conscience is vnwasshed.
They keep their sabbot holy from bodily works / but in the mean time / they
have their breast vnquyeted with hate, anger, simony / and other troubles of
the soul. They fere to be contamynate if they taste porke or pygge / but they
think them selfs clean when they with gredy eeres here foul comunycacion and
bakbityng of other. They think them selfs fyled if they touch any caren /
but yet they abhor not to touch a queen or stolen gear. They think it a
foul sin if they use onye garment of lynen and woollen mengled together / but
they sto^de not amysse in their own conceyte when they have their breast
ouercouerd with so many foul vices. It is a great shame therefore to them to
boste them self that they alone know god seeing that they deny him in their
deeds more then any other. Do they not deny him, when they are so spotted with
ye fylthyes of the soul, that they are to most me^ abhomynable, and when they
be so weak, yea and deed in believe, yt no man can handle them. And finally
when in all deeds of true faith and service toward god by which we should
make god to be merciful to us / they be far wors then other men be.

The second chapyter.
BUt let the^ go with their fables / let ye naughtines of these men move the
nothing at all / but for all them remember thine office and duty, and speak
tho things that be indede mete for the learning of the gospel / yt is to say
which may make us commendable to god for our clean minds and clean manners /
and declare that we be the dyscyples of Christ. But here peradventure you wylt
ask me what thiges they be. Thou shall warn the elders and senyours of the
people yt they be sobre / wachfull / and dylygent to all works of virtue / and
that they overcome the dulnes of their age with the quikenes of faith. warn
them also y^ they keep grauyte and that they play not the foles like young men
uncomely in their old age. And that they be of good and sad manners / yt the
youth may have them in reverence and awe / and temperate them self that they
be not waywarde and soon an angered as ye common sort of old men is / and
well commended of other and with out blame not only for the integryte of their
feythe / but also in doing deeds of charity / and in suffrynge of
inco^modityes and trybulations, namely for the gospel of christ. On ye same
manner thou shall warn old weme^ that they go apparelled after such manner as
becomes them that will be named christen folk / they must not blame the
living of other / which fault is peculyer to this sex and age. They must
not be given to ouermoche drynckynge of wine / how be it y^ use of wine must be
permytted to age / so it be moderate. They must teache maidens and young women
honest things / no nycenesse or other ill manners and so bring them up that
they love their own husbondes and their children / and that they be sobre and
chaste / and busy at home, and for to se their houses well ordered and play
the good housewyues. For this surely is ye chefest praise yt women can have, to
be known subject and obedyent to their husbondes / that by their lewd manners
the name of god, (whose relygeon they profess) be not sclaundred. For sythen
we se ye wives of myscreauntes or hethen men to behave them self right
womanly in these points belongyng to womanhod / what shall such infydeles say
if they se christsten women in ye laid points worse then be their women whom
as they are christen / so they ought a great deal to pass them in honestye
and virtue. Now what thing old women must by thine instruction teach young
maidens and young wives / that same shalt thou thy self teach young men /
exhortyng them to be sobre and moderate in their affections / that ye heat of
youth overthrow them not hedlynge in to viciousnes. And that thou may with
more efficacy persuade these things. First of all be thou thy self to them
an example of honest deeds, and yt in all office of godly life. For no man
does sooner or easylyer pswade, then he which constantly does as he
teaches. Thou shalt therefore teach the youth thus, and in the mean space in
teaching live uprightly that thy life be not corrupt with any vice / and keep
such grauyte that it may make them to have thy doctrine in reverence and
awe. And therefore so moderate all thy life and words that there can nothing be
found in the / to be despised and set at naught / so that not only they
which be under thy loore / may obey the / but also they that were before
against the gospel, may be a shamed of their ill saying / when they shall se
all things in the so without blame, that they which lie in wait for the, and
seek all ye occasyons they can, to chop at the, can find nothing whereby they
ca^ justly speak any thing against y^. As concerning servants exhort them
to be obedyente to their masters and dylygente to please them in all things
that not by the profession of Christ's religion they may seem to be made wors
then they were before / and thereby may begin reproach to be given to the
gospel / when it is all the fruit of naughty parsons. Let them not therefore be
full of excuses, and ill wylled to do their masters commau^deme^tes, nor preny
pykers / as the most sort of ill servants be / that seeing they profess the
gospel they declare them self in all seruyse to be don to their masters,
faithful and true / yea though their masters do but little deserve it of them.
So that through their honest manners they may commend and set forth the doctrine
of our savior god / yt by them mo men may be drawn to the following of it / if
men se such as knowledge them self to be christen men / to be thereby more
gentle and amyable in all their living. For in this through ye gospel has
shined ye goodness and gentelnes of god our savior not before known. And it
has not shyned only to the jews / but egaliy to all men, not that after we
be delyuerd fro the burden of Moses law / we should live after our own will
/ but we be taught / that after that by baptysine y^ fautes of our life before
past be forgeuen us / and that we sweryng to abide by Christ's words have ones
renou^ced and given up the wicked relygyon and worshipping of images, of ydols
and with them also all worldly desires / so that after we should led our life
here in this world that it may appear verily yt we be regenerat or newborn
in Christ, and made quyte other men then we were before. And we which served
before to wyckedness / to unhappy deeds and diverse affections / which even as it
were baits drew us to vyllanye: must from hence forth keep such moderation
that we be in no wise trobled with desires of worldly things. Let us show in us
justice / yt as much as is in us, we do for every man, and hurt no man / that
we may now give with a true professyon and hole life to god such worship as we
gave before to deuyls. And though in the mean season we be punished with pouerte
/ barenes, sclaunder / chydynges / and diverse other euylles / let us not think
that our good living is baraine, nor let us not therefore hunt after rewards of
this world / which be neither in comparyson great / nor of no long durance /
but let us look for that great reward of everlasting life that shall then
chance when after yt this world is ended. In the which the members of Christ
be yet busyed by afflyctions and sclaunders. God the father shall open in his
worshyppers in his glory and magnifycence / all their euylles overcome not
apperyng humble but glorious and ferefull to wicked men. And to gither with ye
father shall appear in ye same glory the lord and savior Jesus Christ geuyng
to his me^bres yt same everlasting life in ye which he now shines, for he by
cause yt no man shall mystrust his promise, wittingly and willingly came to his
death, and holy gave him self to us / yt he being fre from all sin would
redeem us by yt price of his blood, from ye tyranny of the devil / to who^ by
our soul sins we were subject. And after yt he had done away clean our
offenses make to hy^ of us a new and his own people, which after his own
example should despise all euilles and ye enticeme^tes of this world and his
reward trod under fete, should labor to get the enherytaunce of everlasting
life, which christ does promise to all yt keeps ye profession of the gospel
truly and with clenelyfe.

The third chapyter.
THese things my Tytus wiche be a great deal wide from the fabls of ye Jews
/ speak them openly. Exhort all people to follow them and such as bend away
from them rebuke them with by authoryte / that such men as will not be
persuaded by lerning, nor will not be moved by fair exhortations, nor by
sharp and ernestful correction made to refrain. For there be some fautes that
must be healed by seneryte. Here therefore show forth the grauyte and
authoryte of a bishop and so behave thy self / yt no man may have any just
cause to despise the. Pride and hawte countenance must not be in the / but
when so ever need requires thou must show thine authoryte. Now as I would
have that all servants should be to their masters, yea though they be
gentyles / even such by thy monycyon would I have all christian men to be to
their princes and to such as are head officers under them / though such prices
or rulers under whom they be, are the^ self vncrystened. For this must we in
any manner of wise take heed unto / that no man may by our manners, catch any
occasyon to alienat him self fro the gospel. But it would so chance if they
that be heddes and rulers should perceive that we by reason of the professyon
that we have taken / were more sedicyous and stately, and less obedyent to
their commandments. For they would anon ley that to the fault of the gospel
/ and so more wtdrawe their minds fro the professyon thereof. warn them
therefore that believe in Christ / yt they be never the more for all that free
fro the laws and authorite of the kings or princes or other rulers under
whose domynio^ they be / but they must the rather because they be christen
men, be obedyente subjects / and gladly do as they be commanded / and ready
and prone to every good work / then men may se them do as they ought to do not
being constrained thereto for fear of punishment / but of their own fre will.
For if the heddes do command that which is ryghtfull / it is great iniquite
and a foul ensample to dysobey him that is heed over all other. But again if
they command and rule otherwise then right is / if they oppress their
subjects to hardly / if they call to fore upon them: yet gentleness and
suffrance is more comely for no man the^ ye folowers of Christ. what so ever
they command us that is not against ye very relygyon of god / we must therein
gladly obey. They will peradventure take away our goods / what then? For them
grows to us a great treasure of good virtuous living. They will bannishe us
out of ye country. It makes no matter / for Christ is every where ready to
comfort his servants. Here peradventure some man will say / what and our
princes be hethen men and worshyppars of Idolles / contamynate with open vices /
enemies to Christ's faith. They that be such / be such to their own harm
and ieoperdy / it is not our part to condemn them but to amend them. And
better they may be induced by obedyence / suffrance / and examples of good
living / then by rebellyon / or opprobrious sayenges. Let us leave them to
their judge / and let us remember what is sitting for us. Christ did pray for
them that blasphemyd him / so fer wide it is that he would give chek for chek /
how is it then conuenyente that his discyples should be contumelious against
any man as lovers of strife and debate? But rather after the example of him /
whose name they do profess / they must be gentle / showing all myldenes not
only unto honest men and such as have well deserved it / but also must be
obedyent unto every man. To good men because they deserve it / to ill men that
they amend / and again that they have not a wors opynion of our believe / if
they be provoked and angered for a cause. Christen charity suffers all things
/ and in all things it has good hope. And if there be any such ill men / we
must rather pytye them, then abhor them. And therefore we shall do more if we
call to remembrance that we were sometime such as they be now. Let us not
refuse them by cause they are ill lyuers, and wicked men / but let us help ye
best that we can / that they cease to be as they be* and begin to be like us
/ who called us from our blyndnesse? was it not ye free clemency or sweet
gentleness of Christ And that same gentleness of christ may change such men
when he will. And how be it that we which of Jews be made christen men, did
not worship Idolles / yet we were before our conuersyon subject to great vices,
being foles / iobedyent / erryng / given to diverse appetites and pleasures /
full of enui, full of malice, grudgyng and hati^g one of another. To these so
great euylles we were subject eue^ under Moises law, but that now for foles
and dulheddes we be made sobre and wise / yt for rebels we are meke and
treatable / for men errynge / having knowledge of the truth / for the servants
of desires and voluptuousnes / the willing kepers of justice, for malycious /
simple and curtes / for envious / glad to do good / for haters, well willing to
them that hate us / this have we not neither by moses law nor yet by our own
merits, but by yt free goodness of god / by the which we coueyte that all if it
be possible should rejoice with us in a common welfare / and to all me^ the
verite of ye gospel may shine, as it has shined to us. For before like blind
men we were still in darkness as they, but now sens there is opened by the
light of ye gospel / how great the goodness and charity of god (which is autour
of our health) is to all men / then at the last we gate true life after that we
had put away the darkness of our life that we led before / not through the
observation of Moses law / in whom was contained a manner of justice* but yet
of little efficacye to give everlasting life / but through the free mercy of
god. For by the holy font of baptysme we were regenerat again and planted in
Christ, and by his spirit being renewed we have ceased to be carnal and
bego^ne to be spiritual. Therefore what so ever we be / we are holy bound to
him for it, which in to us nothing deseruynge it / shed abundantly his
spyryte / which the law could not give. And by Jesus Christ he shed his
spyryte in to us, by who^ it has pleased him to give us all things / that we
being purged by his benefit, from our old sins should enforce by good works
to be made apt to take ye enherytau^ce of immortal life. Of ye which the
doctrine of the gospel makes us to have sure hope. Sens that we then were
ones miserable / and by the only aboundante mercy of god deleuered from sin
now hope for the crown of everlasting life we must have pyty on other / and go
about by all means that god also may have mercy on them. Let a christen
bishop instead of jews fables tell these things to the people, for they be
certain and without doubt. There remains nothing more for us to do / but yt
in our living we may remember ye benefyte of god and live according to his
pleasure / or else the professyon of chrystendome and the gospel will nothing
avail us. wherefore I will that you assure all men of these things which
greatly long to the purpose and co^fyrm the^ therein also / yt they which ones
have believed i^ god / yt by his free mercifulnes they have been redeemed fro
their sins / and that he will give ye crou^e of everlasting life to all them
which by virtuous and godly living do study to follow as nere as they are able
Jesus Christ / yt they I say which have this believe so led over their life that
it may seem according to our professyo^ and not unworthy so great promyssys
of god. Now they shall declare them self to be very christian men / not if they
curse or say ill by ye gentyles and jews / but if they be beneficial and
gentle to all men / and by the affection that they have to pyty / they rejoice
to help every body. For these things shall not only ornate and commend ye
professyon of the christen believe / as things of them self honest / but also
profitable to draw other to Christ and to help other which be oppressed with
any calamyte. The chief point of chrystentye is to do good to all men / and by
benefits wild bestes be overcome and made tame and gentle. Thou shall
therefore on this manner speak and preach of these things not making any
doubt as they do which redacte all things in to questyons and seem to have
nothing perfyghtly to them assured / but teach them with great confydence of
countenance with great stedfastnes of words / yt all men may well perceive
and understand that you art well assured of that which thou do labor to
persuade to other men / yt out of these comes ye fruit of virtuous living.
But folysshe and vnco^nynge questyons and tangled or intrycate genealogyes and
contencyous or brawlyng dysputations or rather war upon Moses law / which
some following the trade of jews stir up and move to get them thereby a name
and aduau^tage / cast them away as superfluous and unprofitable to ye living
after ye gospel. For what hurts it to good living if I know not / why
Moses grave can no where be found / whether it be as ye jews say that he
should be called up again by magicie^s? How many years Matusale lived? what age
Salamo^ was of, when he begat Roboam? why Moses did forbed to eat the flesh
of swyne? why ye jews do suppose that the blood of a wesell must with so
great care be purged / and other things they move doubts upon, which be yet
more folyshe then these. In the expou^dyng whereof what neadeth him to tarry
which hastes to the reward of good and virtuous living. These things must
rather be cut away then declared. And they which profess them as excellent
things must be blamed and bid to hold their peace and not disputed with all.
If they err by symplenes / when they are admonysshed they will amend. But if
they do amysse by stubberne and obstacle malice / for a name or lucre or any
other foul cause / then will they be redye also to defend as well false
things as trwe. Such men when thou have ones or twyse rebuked them / if they
cease not / exchew them as men faccyous and incurable / lest they may do
more, when they be provoked / then they would if they were let alone as men not
regarded / yea and left to / by such eggyng and styrryng of them* it might
come to danger / that such which cannot be amended, might by dysputations when
they are provoked draw their admonytour into ye same error. And what avails
it to give any more medycynes when there is no longar hope of recouerynge. An
error coming but only by the fragilite of man, is remedyed by one or two
warnynges but malice is icurable, and made wors, by putting to of any remedies.
And therefore he yt being ones or twyse rebuked co^tine with nevertheless to bide
stife in his opinion / let him alone in his froward mind a man quite
ouerturned and remedyles. Nor it neadeth not ye to labor to condemn him /
sythen he is by his own judgment condemned. If he perische / he is lost and
cast away by his own fault. For he has no such bukler to hold before him. I
erred by ignorance / no man warned me. For what can one do to a syk man / that
will take no medycyne / peradventure if he be despised and neglect / he will
wex wyser / if he will not / yet the fewer that resort to him / ye fewer shall
ye co^tagyousnes of his disease infecte. I would fayn have you with me a few
days. But I would yt it should not be to the damages / of ye christian
congregations in Crete which have been but of late converted to ye true faith,
and therefore they have the more neade of a diligent head / which may build upon
the fundations now laid. Se therefore that thou mete with me at Nycopole / but
not before yt I send either Artemas or Tichtcus thither to be there for ye in my
stead, lest thy deptyng should leave Crete destytute and as an Orpheline. Thou
shall not need to fear that I would in ye mean time go any where else and so
thou sholdest lose thy labor / For I am purposed all this next winter to be
at Nycopole which is a city of the co^tre of Thrace. when zeno which was
sometime a professor of Moses law / and now a noble preacher of ye gospel.
And Apollo which is a man greatly aproued in ye doctrine of Christ will depart
from thens bring them forward with all the humanytye that may be. And se they
lak nothing yt shall be necessary for their journey. If these offices of
humanytie be done of the gentyles / that they will for good manners sake bring
him forward if he have deserved it / and give him sufficiently at his
depertyng vitayles and other necesaries to his journey. I thy^ke it very right
that our men also / which knowledge them self to be christian men should learn
to use such gentylnes / and to give due thanks to them that have well
deserved them / not yt they should by their lyberalyte make them rich / but yt
they give them such things as be necessary for their living, when need shall
be. For it is not conuenyent yt sythen they which be alyenat from Christ / be
yet taught of nature to give thanks to them of whom they have been helped with
any benefit: christian men should be baren and unfruitfully to them of whom they
have received any good turn. As many as be here with me commend them to the.
Do thou again co^me^d me there to as many as love me not with no worldly
affection, but with euangelycall and christen charity / which the common
professyon of faith does ge^dre in us. The fre benefyce^ce of goodness of god be
always with us all. Amen.
