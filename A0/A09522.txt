Here after follows ye battle of Egyngecourte and the great sege of Rone by
king Henry of Moumouthe the fyfthe of the name that wan Gascoyne and Gyenne
and Normandye.
GOd that all this world did make
And dyed for us upon a tree
Save england for mary thy mothers
As you art steadfast god in trynyte
And save king Henry soul I beseech y^ sake
That was full gracious and good with all
A courtyouse knight and king ryall
Of Henry the fyfthe noble man of war
Thy deeds may never forgoten be
Of knyghthod thou were the very lodestarre
In thy time England floured in prosperyte
Thou mortal myrrour of all cheualry
Though thou be not set among ye worthyes nine.
yet wast thou a conqueroure in thy time
Our king send in to France full rathe
His harraude that was good and sure
He desired his heritage for to have
That is Gascoyne and Gyen and Normandye
He bad the Dolphyne deliver / it should be his
All that belongyd to the first Edward
And if he said me nay I wys
I will get it with dent of sword
But than answered the Dolphyne bold
By our inbassatours sendynge again
Me think that your king is not so old
Wars great for to maintain
Great well he said your comely king
That is both gentle and small
A tun full of tenys balls I will him send
For to play him therwithall
Than bethought our lords all
In France they would no longer abide
They took their leave both great and small
Tnd home to England began they ride
To our king they told their tale to the end
What that the Dolphyne did to them say
I will him thank than said the king
By the grace of god if I may
Yet by his own mind this Dolphyne bold
To our king he sent agaynne hastily
And prayed him trewes for to hold
For Jesus love that dyed on a tree
Nay than said our comely king
For in to France will I wind
The Dolphyne anger I trust I shall
And such a tenys ball I shall him send
That shall bear down the hye rofe of his hall
The king at westmynster lay that time
And all his lords euerychone
As they did set them down to dyne
Lordynges he said by saint John^
To France I think to take my way
Of good council I you pray
What is your will that I shall done
Show me shortly without delay
The duke of Clarence answered sone
And said my liege I council you so
And other lords said we think it for the best
With you to be ready for to goo
While that our lives may endure and lest
Gramercy syrs the king began say
Our right I trust than shall be won
And I will quyte you if I may
Therefore I warn you both old and young
To make you ready without delay
To Southampton to take your way
At saint Peter's tide at Lammas
For by the grace of god and if I may
Over the salt see I think to pass
Great ordinance of gunnes the king let make
And shypte them at London all at ones
Bows and arowes in chestes were take
Speres and bylles / with yeen gunstones
And armynge dagars made for the nones
With swerdes and bucklers that were full sure
And harneys bright that strokes would endure
The king to Southampton than did ride
With his lords for no longer would he dwell
Fyftene. C. fair ships there did him abide
With goodly sails and to peastell
Lords of France our king they sold
For a myllyant of gold as I hard say
By England little pryse they told
Therefore their song was welawaye
Between hampton and the isle of wight
These goodly ships lay there at rode
With mast yardes a cross full semely of sight
Over all the haven sprede a broad
On every paues acrosse read
The wastes decked with serpentynes strong
Saint Georges stremers spread over head
With the arms of England hanging all alonge
Our king full hastily to his ship yede
And all other lords of every degree
Every ship wayed his anchor in deed
With the tide to have them to the sea
They hoysed their sails sailed a lofte
A goodly fight it was to see
The wind was good and blew but soft
And fourth they went in the name of the trynyte
Their course they took toward Normandy
And passed over in a day and a night
So in the second mornonge yerly
Of that contrye they had a sight
And ever they drew nere the cost
Of the day glad were they all
And when they were at the shore almost
Every ship his anchor let fall
With their takyls they lau^ched many a long bote
And over hache threw them in to the stream
A thousand shortly they saw a flote
With men of arms that lyth did leme
Our king landed at Cottaunses without delay
On our lady euenth assumpcyon
And to Hartflete they took the way
And mustered fair before the town
Our king his banner there did splay
With standerdes bright and many penowne
And there he pyght his tente adowne
Full well broydered with armory gaye
First our comely kings tente with the crown
And all other lords in good array
My brother Clarence the king did say
The toures of the town will I keep
With her daughters and her maidens gay
To wake the frenchemen of their sleep
London he said shall with him mete
And my gunnes that lies fair upon the grene
For they shall play with Harfflete
A game at tennys as I wene
God we to game for gods grace
My children be ready euerychone
For every great gunne that there was
In his mouth he had a stone
The Capytayne of Herfflet soon anon
Unto our king he sent hastily
To know what his will was to done
For to cume thither with such a meny
Deliver me the town the king said
Nay said ye Capytayne by god and by saint Denis
Than shall I win it said our king
By the grace of god and of his goodness
Some hard tennys balls I have hither brought
Of marble and yren made full round
I swear by Jesus that me dear bought
They shall beat the walls to the ground
Than said the great gunne
Hold fellows we go to game
Thanked be Mary and Jesus her sone
They did the frenchemen much shame
Fyftene before said London tho
Her balls full fair she began out throw
Thyrty said ye second gun I will wyn and I may
There as the wall was most sure
They bare it down without nay
The kings daughter said harken this play
Harken maidens now this tide
Five and forty we have / it is no nay
They beat down the walls on every side
The Normandes said let us not abide
But gowe in haste by one assent
Where so ever the gunstones do glyde
Our houses in Herfftete is all to rent
The englys shemenourbul warkes have brent
And women cried alas that ever they were borne
The frenchemen said now be we shent
By us now the town is forlorn
It is best now theyrfore
That we beseech this englys she king of grace
For to assail us no more
Lest he dystroye us in this place
Than will we bid the Dolphyne make him ready
Or else this town deryuered must be
Messengers went fourth by and by
And to out king come they
The lord Corgraunte certainly
For he was Capytayne of the place
And Gelam Bowsec with him did hye
With other lords more and less
And when they to our king come were
Full lowly set them on their kne^
Hayle comely king began they say
Christ save the from aduersyte
Of truse we will beseech the
Until that it be sunday noone
And if we may not recovered be
We will deliver the town
Than said our king full soon
I grant you grace in this tide
One of you shall fourth anon
And the re^naunt shall with me abide
Their Capytayne took his next way
And to Rone fast began he ride
The Dolphyne he had thought there to found
But he was gone he durst not abide
For help the Capytayne besought that tede
Herfflete is lost for ever and aye
The walls ben beten down on every side
That we no longer keep it may
Of counseyll all he did them pray
What is your will that I may done
We must ordeyne the king hatayll by sunday
Or else deliver him the town
The lords of Rone to gyther did rowne
And bad the town should openly yield
The king of england fares as a lion
We will not mete with him in the field
The Capytayne would than no longer abide
And to ward Harfflete came he right
For so fast he did ride
That he was there the same night
And when he to our king did come
Lowly he set him on his kne
Hayle comely prince than did he say
The grace of god is with the
Here have I brought the keys all
Of Harfflete that is so to yall a city
All is yours both chamber and hall
And at your veyll for to be
Thanked he Jesus said our king
And Mary his mother truly
Mine uncle Dorset without lettynge
Capytayne of Herfflete shall he be
And all that is within the city
A while yet they shall abide
To amend the walls in every degree
That is beten down on every side
And after that they shall out ride
To other towns over all
Wife nor child shall not there abide
But have them forth both great and small
One and twenty. M. men might se
when they went out full fore did weep
The great gunnes and ordinance truly
Was brought in to Herfflete
Great sykenes among our host was in good fay
Which killed many of our englysshemen
There dyed by yonde.vii. score upon a day
Alive there was left but thousands.x.
Our king him self in to the castle yede
And rested him there as long as his will was
At the last he said lords so god me speed
Toward Calayes I think to pass
After that Herfflete was gotten that royal city
Through the grace of god omnypotente
Our comely king made him ready soon
And toward Calayes fourth he went
My brother Glocestre veramente
Here will we no longer abide
And Cosyn of york this is our intent
With us fourth ye shall this tide
My Cosyn Huntyngdon with us shall ride
And the Earl of Oxenforde with you three
The duke of Southfolke by our side
He shall come fourth with his meny
And the Earl of Deuounshyre sykerly
Sir thomas harpynge that never did fail
The lord Broke that come heartily
And sir John^ of cornwall
Sir Gylberde Vmfrey that would us avail
And the lord clyfforde so god me speed
Sir wyllyam Bouser that will not fail
For all thy will help if it be need
Our king rode fourth blessed might he be
He spared neither dale ne down
By waters great fast rode he
Till he came to the water of seen
The frenchemen threw the bridge adowne
That over the water they might not pass
Our king made him ready than
And to the tower of Turreyn went more and less
The frenchemen our king abought becast
With batayles strong on every side
The duke of Orlyaunce said in haste
The king of England shall abide
Who gave him leave this way to pass
I trust that I shall him begyle
Full long or he come to Calays
The duke of Burbone answered fone
And swear by god and by saint Denis
We will play them euerychone
These lords of England at the tenys
Their Gentylmen I swear by laynt Ihon^
And archers we will sell them great plentye
And so will we ryd them sone
Six for a penny of our monye
Than answered the duke of Bare
Words that were of great pride
By god he said I will not spare
Over all the englysshemen for to ride
If that they dare us abide
We will overthrow them in fere
And take them prisoners in this tide
Than come home again to our dynere
Henry our king that was so good.
He prepared there full ryally
Stakes he let hew in a wood
And set them before his archers verily
The frenchemen our ordinance ganespye
They that we ordained for to ride
Lyghted adowne with sorrow truly
So on their foot fast began abide
Our king went up upon an hill hye
And looked down to the valyes low
He saw where the frenchemen came hastily
As thycke as ever did hayle or snow
Than kneled our king down in that stounde
And all his men on every side
Every man made acrosse and kyssed the ground
And on their fete fast ganne abide
Our king said syrs what time of the day
My liege they said it is nigh pryme
Than go we to our journey
By the grace of Jesus it is good time
For saints that lie in their shryne
To god for us they be prayenge
All the relygyouse of England in this time
Ora pro nobis for us they sing
Saint George was seen over our host
Of very truth this sight men did se
Down was he sent by the holygoste
To give our king the vyctory
Than blewe the trompetes merely
These two batayles to gyther yede
Our archers stood up full heartily
And made the frenchemen fast to blede
Their arowes went fast without any let
And many shot they through out
Thorugh habergyne brestplate and bassenet
A.xi. M. were slain in that route
Our gracious king as I well know
That day he fough with his own hand
He spared neither hye ne low
There was never king in no land
That ever did better on a day
Wherefore England may sing a song
Laus deo may we say
And other prayers ever among
The duke of Orlyaunce without nay
That day was taken prysonere
The duke of Burbone also in fere
And also the duke of Bare truly
Sir Bergygaunte he began him yield
And other lords of France many
Lo thus out comely king conquered the fyld
Be the grace of god omnypotent
He took his presoners both old and young
And to ward Calayes fourth he went
He shypped there with good intent
To Cauntorbury full fair he passed
And offered to saint Thomas thryne
And through Keut he rode in haste
To Eltam he came all in good time
And over blackeheth as he was riding
Of the City of London he was ware
Hayle ryall City said our king
Christ keep the ever from sorrow and care
And than he gave that noble Cite his blessyng^
He prayed Jesus it might well fare
To westmynster did he ride
And the french prisoners with him also
He raunsommed them in that tide
And again to their contrye he let them goo
Thus of this matter I make an end
To theffecte of the battle have I gone
For in this book I cannot comprehend
The greatest battle of all called ye sege of Rome
For that sege lasted.iii. year and more
And there a rat was at.xl. pens.
For in the City the people hongered fore
Women and children for fault of mete were lore
And some for pain bare bones were gnawynge
That at her breasts had.ii. children soukynge
Of the sege of Rone it to write were pytye
It is a thing so lamentable
Yet every hye feast / our king of his charytye
Gave them meat to their bodies comfortable
And at the last / the town wanne wout fable
Thus of all as now I make an end
To the bliss of heaven god our souls send.
Thus ends ye battle of Egyngcourt
Inpryntyd at London in Foster lane in saint Leonardes paris she by me John^
Skot.
