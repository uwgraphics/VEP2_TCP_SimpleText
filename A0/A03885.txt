THE FIRST CONTROVERSY.
OF THE WRITTEN WORD OF GOD. The first Part of the first Controversy.
CHAP. I. Of the Scope and Method of this Treatise.
ALL the Controuersyes of this time may be reduced to two heads: for either
they are certain general principles and foundations of our faith and
Religion, or they are particular questions appertayning to the same. Amongst
other general Principles there be two, about which is the greatest contention
at this day: the one is, the Word of God, the other, the Church: we will first
speak of the word of God, and afterward of the Church: and lastly we will
examine every particular Controversy, if God shall grant us life and health.

2. Two things do now adays hold many in error. The one is a false opinion
that many have, who think it a matter of little importance, whether they give
credit or no to many things taught by the Roman Church: which dangerous
persuasion may be taken out of the minds of all faithful people, by that
which we shall deliver concerning the word of God, and the Church, for thereby
it shall evidently appear, that al things are firmly to be believed, which
the Roman Church belieueth, and that without this faith no man can hope to be
saved. The other is, that such as desire to find out the true faith in every
particular Co^trouersy, are oftentimes so hindered by the sleights and falsehoods
of our Adversaries, as it will be very hard for them to discern that which is
true, from that which is false. Wherefore we will endeavor in every particular
Controversy, to set down the true state of the question. Afterward we will lay
open the foundation of the Catholic doctrine. And lastly we will plainly and
briefly answer the chief objections of our Adversaries, whether they be
drawn out of the Scriptures, or taken from the Fathers.

3. And because our Adversaries evermore boast and brag of the written Word of
God, pretending out of it only to prove their doctrine and impugn ours: our
chief care shall be to show, that the Catholic and Roman faith is both
evidently and strongly to be confirmed out of the wrirten Word of God, and the
doctrine of our Adversaries to have no foundation at all in the holy
Scriptures, but is manifestly opposite and repugnant thereunto: yet so, as we
will set down the uniform consent of the ancient Church to be agreeing with
us in every Controversy, leaving the more ample search of antiquity unto
others, to whom we will refer the Reader, setting down their particular
names; so loath we are that this book of ours should grow too great: and for
the same reason we have thought good to omit many arguments which might be
drawn out of the holy Scriptures for confirmation of the Catholic faith,
contenting our selves to set down only the more solid and evident proofs,
because we are resolved to be as brief as may be.

CHAP. II. Of the Word of God in general.
THE word of God, if we speak of it in general, may be considered two ways,
either for that One, Eternal, and Infinite Word which contains perfectly in
it self whatsoeur is in the mind of Almighty God, which is the same with the
Son of God, and Word of the Father, of whom S. John speaks in his Gospel
saying, In the beginning was the Word, and of this Word we are to say nothing
here: but the Word of God may be other wise considered and taken for that
Word, which was not always, nor contains all things which are in the mind
of God, but a small part only of them, to wit, such things as God would have
us know and believe: and of the Word of God in this sense we speak now. For
this Word is the proper and complete object of our faith.

2. Moreover this Word has two conditions or properties, the one is, that the
same be revealed unto us: for there are innumerable verities in the mind of
God, the which, because they are not revealed to us, do not app^rtayne to this
Word. The other is, that it be immediately revealed by God, for such things as
God manifests Romans 2. v. 19. and ^0. Heb. 11. v. 1.
unto us by natural reason, appertain not to this Word of God, called
therefore by the Deuines, the revealed Word of God.

3. Of this Word of God so understood, there is no Controversy between us and
our Adversaries, but only in words: for wher^s our Adversaries say, that
Catholics affirm, that we must with divine faith believe the words of men, or
which is worse, rather believe the words of men then the Word of God; it is a
mere slander, for there is no Catholic so ignorant, but he knows that the
Theological virtue Faith, relieth altogether upon the pure, sincere, and
certain Word of God alone, according to that of S. Paul, When you had
received of us the 1. These. 2. v. 13.
word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as the
Word of God, as indeed it is. Neither can any man doubt, but that the revealed
word of God is partly the written Word contained in the Canonical books of
the old and new Testament, partly unwritten and delivered by tradition and
preaching, of which unwritten ^. These. c. 2. v. 14. and 1. ad Cor. 15. v. 1. ad
Gal. 1. v. ^. 1. Pet. 1. v. vl^.
word the Scripture makes mention in many places, but we will first treat of
the written Word.

CHAP. III. Of the written Word of God.
THE witten Word of God consists of two parts, of the Letter which every man
may read in the books themselves, and in the true sense of the Letter, which is
as it were the very soul and life thereof, without which the Letter alone
rather kills the^ quickneth or gives life: as we see evidently by experience
in the Jews, Arians, and all other heretics, as well new as old: for the
Jews hold themselves stiffely to the Letter of the old Testament, and the
Arians, as also in a manner all other heretics, receive either altogether, or
for the greatest part the Letter of the new; but because they will not
acknowledge the true sense of the Letter, Jews they are, Heretics they are,
Catholics they are not. And surely the Letter alone without the true sense,
cannot truly* and properly be called the Word of God, no more then a body
without a soul can truly and properly be called a man: wherefore they which
spoil the Letter of the true sense, may be compared to them who be^eaue a man
of his soul and life.

2. But whosoever do substitute another contrary sense and meaning in place of
the true, do no otherwise, then they, who not only kill a man, but by Art
Magic bring into the body of the man killed, some other diabolical spirit,
by which the dead body is so moved and stirred, as it seems to many to be
alive: all this is so manifest a truth, as our Aduersa^ies themselves are not
able to deny it.

3. This to have been the doctrine* of the ancient Church sufficiently
appears Aug. ser* ^8. de temp.
by the words of S. Augustine. The unhappy Jews* says he, and more unhappy
Heretics, whilst they attend only to the sound of the Letter, as a body
without a soul, so they remain dead, and void of the spirit which quickneth.
And else where: All Heretics which receive Aug Epist. 22^
the Scriptures and their authority, will seem to follow them, whereas indeed
they follow rather their own errors, and are therefore Heretics, not because
they contemn them, but because they do not understand them. And before him S.
Hilary that honor of the French Nation. Remember Hill. l. ad Constant. Imperat.
(says he) that there is not one of the heretics which does not say, that he
preaches now according to the Scriptures, even those things in which he
blasphemeth, albeit he lies in so saying. And a little after: All of them
speak Scriptures without the true sense and meaning, they pretend says
without faith indeed, for the Scriptures consist not so much in the reading, as
in the vnderfla^ding, neither are they understood of such as go into
preuarication, but continue and abide in charity. Moreover S. Hierome. Let us
not think (says Hieron. in c. 1. ad. Gal.
he) the Gospel to be in the words of the Scripture, but in the sense, not in
the out side, but in the inside, or marrow, not in the leau^s of the words, but
in the sappe^p^th, or root os reason. And a little after: otherwise Matt. 4.
v. 6.
even the Devil himself speaks Scriptures, and all heresies, according to
Ezechiel, make unto themselves pillowes which they may lay under the elbow o^
every age. Ezec. 13. v. 18.


2. By that which has been said, answer may be made to our Adversaries when
they object against us, that we affirm the Scripture to be imperfect, obscure,
like a nose of wax which a man may writh which way he will, and lastly the
origin and spring in a manner of all heresies: for we affirm this of the naked
and dead letter alone, destitute of the true sense; or rather of the letter, to
which the Heretics add their own perverse sense and meaning: neither have
our Adversaries any cause to wonder at this, seeing S. Paul himself says of
the bare letter alone, that it kills, and brings eternal death 1. Cor. ^.
v. 6. 7. and 9.
and damnation. But never any* Catholic did ever attribute any such thing to
the living letter, which has conjoined with it the true and native sense, and
which alone is truly and properly the word of God.

CHAP. IIII. How we are to seek out the true sense and meaning of the holy
Scripture.
THERE is great contention beweene us and our Adversaries about the means how
to find out the true and natural interpretation of the letter* a thing so
necessary to eternal salvation. They teach diverse things concerning this
matter, but deliver nothing that is certain. One assigns more rules to this
purpose, another fewer, but when they have said all; they confess at last that
there was never any which has not at sometime erred in seeking out the true
interpretation of holy Scripture. For they give not their assent either to the
ancient Fathers, or to their own Masters in all things they teach or write:
nay they cannot assign any one whom they acknowledge not to have erred
sometime, nor dare affirm to be free from error, seeing as they say, Every man
is a liar: and so at last all Romans 3. v. 4.
things are left by them doubtful and uncertain.

2. But the Catholics do proceed after another manner, who teach, that the
certain and undoubted sense of the Letter is not to be taken from the judgment
of any particular man, but from the uniform cons^nt of the ancient Fathers,
and especially from the judgment and interpretation of the Catholic Church, to
whom it appertains to judge of the sense and meaning of the holy Scriptures,
as the holy and Oecumenicall Council of Tre^t teaches very well: for there is
no doubt Council. Trident. sess. 4.
but that it is more safe to follow such an interpreter as cannot err, then
such a one as erreth somtymes, or at leastwise may err: but the Church cannot
err in her judgment, seeing that Christ and the ^oly Ghost remain with her to
teach Matt. 28. c vlt. Joan. 14* v. 16. ^oan. 16. v. 13.
^er all truth; whereof more herafter when we shall come to treat of the Church.

3. It shall suffice to observe and ^ote here, that according to the doctrine
of our Adversaries, nothing either solid or certain is contained in the holy
Scri^ture: for whereas all depends of the ^rue sense of the Letter, and with
them ^here is no certain or sure means by which to find out this sense; it
follows, that they call all into doubt, which is in ^he Scripture, whereby who
sees not how much they iniure them. But contrari^yse, according to the
Catholic doctrine, all things are evident and cer^ayne which are contained in
the holy Scriptures, appertayning either to faith, or good manners: the
Catholics having ever a certain and faithful Interpreter, to wit, the
Catholic Church. And surely whosoever rejects the sense which the Church
gives, and in place thereof substituteth another altogether repugnant to it,
does all one with him who rejecting the holy Scripture should in place thereof
bring in a new Scripture of his own forging, the sense of the Scripture being
no less a part of the word of God then the letter, which in these few words
Tertullian confirms out of the tradition of the ancient Church: The sense
adulterated, or falsified is no less repugnant Tertul. de pr^sc. c. 17.
to the truth, then the letter, or style corrupted.

4. And to conclude, it may be inferred, that salvation is to be found in the
Roman Church only, and none at all out Marc. vlt. verse. 16. ^om. 3. v. 1^. Heb.
^^. v. 9.
of it, which I prove thus: Both the Scripture testifyeth, and all me^
confess, that divine faith is necessary to salvation: but such as forsake the
Roman Church, cannot have divine faith, which wholly relieth upon the word of
God only, but merely humane, seeing their faith is founded not in the word of
God, interpreted by the Church which cannot err^, but in the word and
interpretation of Luther, and Calvin, or some other private man, who as they
themselves grant may err, and be deceived: such an humane faith then, so
doubtful and uncertain, and only warranted by man's authority, cannot justify,
or bring a man to eternal salvation.

CHAP. V. How we may know, which is the true letter of the holy Scripture.
ALL such as forsake the Roman Church, and make little account of her
authority, are not only doubtful and uncertain which is the true sense of the
Scripture, but they can have no assurance at all, either of the whole, or of
any part of the letter thereof. For whilst they go about to call in question,
and make doubtful certain books only of the old Testament, before they are
aware, they take away all authority from all other books both of the old and
new Testament. For whereas there is but one certain and undoubted Canon of
these books, to wit, that which is received and approved by the judgment of
the Catholic Church, which cannot err; our Adversaries rejecting this Canon,
make all the books doubtful contained therein: for no certain testimony can be
had of these books, but either by this Canon only, or by the ancient
tradition of the Church, but they neither admit this Canon, nor will stand to
this unwritten Tradition, or acknowledge it for the true word of God.

2. Now as for the Canons lately set out by themselves, no man can safely
believe them, seeing they neither agree one with another, nor with the ancient
Canons of the Church, nor are any where found in the written word of God, which
(as they teach) is only to be believed: neither can they bring any thing,
either concerning the Canon of the Hebrews, or any other ancient Canon, which
they have not taken from the writings of the ancient Fathers, whose authority
without the express written word of God, they will have to be in no wise
sufficient to engender faith: so as even by the judgment of our Adversaries,
none of all these can establish Faith, concerning this matter.

3. John Calvin indeed says, that it Lib. 1. Inst. c. 7. sect. 2. in fine.
is as easy for a faithful man to discern Canonical Scripture from that
which is not Canonical, as to one that sees, it is easy to discern light
from darkness, and white from black. But in so saying See Be^l. lib. 1. de ver.
Deic. 17. 18, 19.
he contradicts both reason and experience, for it is evident that in old
time there was no small controversy amongst the faithful, yea and amongst
learned and godly men concerning many books of the old and new Testament, yea
and also even now amongst such as our Adversaries esteem faithful men, which
Calvin Calu. pros. in Ep. lac. Epist. ad Heb. and ante ^. Petri.
himself in many places confesses,

4. Moreover Caluins own followers well perceauing this, fly unto their own
peculiar spirit, by which they say they are chiefly persuaded and moved, and
not by the only consent of the Church. But these speak nothing to the purpose,
for Rupell. Confess. art. 4.
in faith two things concur, one is the cause or origin of faith, to wit God
himself, and the holy Ghost, whereof there is no controversy between us and
them, for we all acknowledge the holy Ghost to be the principal cause of the
assent we give by faith, that is to say, that it is the holy Ghost who chiefly
persuades us to believe. The other is the object of faith, or that which is to
be believed, whereof we now dispute; for the holy Ghost does not induce us to
believe the false and uncertain devises of men, but the pu^e and sincere word
of God only: we ask therefore of our Adversaries, by what express word of God
he reuealeth unto them, that there are so many Canonical books, and neither
fewer nor more; for we read not this any where in the Scripture, and they admit
only the written Word of God, how can the holy Ghost Calu l. 1. Instit. c. 9.
sect. 1.
then persuade the^ to believe that which is not the word of God? For we are
not now to expect new revelations from God, as do the Anabaptists and
Libertines, whom for this cause our Adversaries condemn. It is necessary
therefore, that if they will have us believe, that they are persuaded by the
holy Ghost to believe such books only to be authentical, as they do say are
such; that they first show this to be a truth expressly contained in holy
Scripture, which they will never be able to do. Wherefore there is no certainty
with them either of the sense of the holy Innocent. 1. ep. 3. c. vlt. Co^ il.
3. Carthag. ca^. 47. S. Aug. Epist. 335. C^cil. Trident. sess. 4.
Scripture, or of the Letter, nor ever will be until they return unto the
Church again. But we Catholics are certain of both, for we have a most
faithful Canon received in the Church more the^ a thousand and two hundred
years ago, confirmed by a general, and Oecumenicall Council.

5. And this to have been the faith and doctrine of the ancient Church for
the discerning of true and authentical Lib. 4. Inst. c. 1^. sect. vlt.
Scriptures, that short but pithy sentence of S. Augustine (whom Calvin
acknowledges to have been the best and most faithful witness of antiquiy)
sufficiently testifyeth, saying: I for my part would not believe the Gospel,
unless I were moved by the authority Aug. co^. Epist. Manich. c. 5.
of the Church, of which place I will say more herafter in the Controversy of
the Church. And else where he says: We receive the old and new Testament in
that number of books which the authority of the holy Catholic Aug. sermon. 10
de temp.
Church delivers. So S. Augustine.

6. I know our Adversaries object many things against many books contained in
our Ecclesiastical Canon, but their chief arguments do not only derogate
authority from those books but also from many others which they receive as
Canonical. For they object, that some Fathers did sometimes doubt of those
books which they will not admit, but they are not ignorant that some Fathers
of old have doubted of the Epistles of S. James, and S. Jude, of the second
Epistle of S. Peter, of the 2. and 3. of S. John, of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, and of the Apocalypse, of which books they dare Rupell. Confess. art.
3.
not now doubt, especially Caluins followers, as is manifest by their
confession of faith.

7. They say further, that in those books which they reject, there are many
things obscure, difficult, and full of contradiction, but what book of
Scripture in a manner is there in the which there do not occur sometimes
things 2. Pet. 3. v. 16.
obscure and hard to be understood? did not S. Peter acknowledge as much? But as
for true contradictions there are none at al, how soever there may be some
things which at the first sight may seem to imply contradiction, yet indeed
all things agree very well together: such a contradiction is oftentimes found
in those books, which even our Adversaries receive, Aug. d^ Do^t. Christia. l.
2. c. 41. and de ser. Dom. in mont. l. 1. c. 3.
yea even in the Ghospells themselves, which for all that are not to be
rejected, but humbly, soberly, and piously to be interpreted, as S. Augustine
many times admonishes.

8. To conclude, all the arguments that our Adversaries make against these
books are fully answered by Catholic writers, which have set out Commentaries
Bell. and Gre^s. Contro. 1 l. 1. c. 7. and sequ. (...). in s^^ Coronol.
upon those books, to wit, Cornelius I ansenius upon Ecclesiasticus, Ioannes
Laurinus upon the book of Wisdom, Ioannes Maldonatus and Chris^oph^r a
Cast^o upon Baruch, and Nicolas Serarius upon the rest of the books of the old
Testament, which our Adversaries call Apocripall, to omit the most Reverend and
famous Cardinal Bellarmine, and his Champion Iacobus Gretserus, as also James
Gordon Lesmoreus. For it is sufficient only to have cited them, seeing that I
write only an abridgment of Controversies, and not any long commentaries upon
the Scripture: And therefore content my self to have showed in this place that
our Adversaries must either receive the Canon of Scriptures, approved be the
Council of Trent, or be utterly destitute of any certain and assured Canon.

CHAP. VI. Of the Hebrew Text.
OUR Adversaries when they are urged with Catholic arguments taken from the
Scriptures, are wont to fly to the Hebrew Text of the old Testament, and to the
Greek text of the new, persuading themselves by this means to attain to the
true and propter sense of the letter: wherefore something is to be said in this
place of the Hebrew and Greek text, both which appertain to the Letter of the
holy Scripture.

2. We grant indeed, that when the Latin translation is either ambiguous or
less plain, the Hebrew text is well and profitably looked into, as also that
diverse mysteries which lie hidden in the Hebrew text, and cannot sufficiently
be explicated in Latin words, may be the better understood. And lastly that we
may the more fully attain unto the force and Emphasis of that holy tongue.

3. But as for the Hebrew text now extant, we do not acknowledge it to be of so
great either authority, or perspicuity as our Adversaries pretend: and we
further deny that the vulgar Editio^ wherinsoeuer it differs from it, is to
be corrected by it, and that for two reasons. The first is, for that the Hebrew
text though never so incorrupt, further then it is approved by the authority of
the Church, is much more doubtful, and uncertain then the Latin. The other
reason is, for that the Hebrew text which is now in use, is in ma^y places
corrupted and depraved, in which the vulgar Edition is entire and uncorrupted.
Both these reasons sh^lbe confirmed in the ensuing Chapters, which the learned
Reader may see in the Latin edition, from the seventh Chapter to the 14. all
which I have omitted to put into English, because I intend to help the less
learned, who are not so capable of that so profou^d and learned a discourse.

CHAP. VII. Of our Adversaries new Translation of the Bible.
THE Catholic Church of Christ not without good cause does reject and condemn
our Adversaries new Translations of the Bible, and that for many reasons. The
first, and most just reason is, because such their translations are replenished
with errors, which have been invented either by Ie^^es, or Heretics, whereof see
many examples in the precdent Chapters of the Latin edition; but we in this
Chapter will set down three other causes or origens from whence these errors
spring, whereby it shall further appear, that our Adversaries can set out no
Translation which shall not be sound full of many and great errors.

2. The first cause, is for that our Adversaries either contemn, or make
little account of the translations and interpretations of the Fathers, and
employ all their labor in finding out all the versions, and interpretations,
and expositions of the Jews, which they highly extol and commend: so as in
their Commentaries upon the old Testament, you shall see them cite Thargus
Rabins, and such other Thalmudicall fictions, but especially Rabbi David Kimhi,
whom sometimes they call learned, sometimes the most learned among the
Hebrews. But of the ancient Fathers no mention at all: for if there be, it is
for the most part, either to tax, or manifestly to oppugn, or even to corrupt
their writings.

3. Now what can be more unreasonable or absurd, then to beg the true sense
of the Scripture of the Jews who 2. Cor. 3. v. 14. and 1 Thessalonians. c. 2. v. 15.
16.
lack faith, and who have a veyle ou^r their hearts, when they read the old
Testament, with whom God is not pleased, and who are Adversaries to all men,
upon whom the Anger of God is come to the end, who pervert all the oracles of
the Prophets that appertain to Christ; and lastly, who are the most malicious
enemies of Christians. And on the other side to despise the excellent Doctors
of Christ's Church, who even in the judgment of our Adversaries were endued with
the Romans 8. v. 9 Ephesians* 4. v. 14.
true faith, full of the holy Ghost, ra^s^d by God, and placed in the Church,
to the end we should not be carried about with every wind of doctrine, who have
d^fended the faith against all he^esies, who have sincerely instructed the
faithful people in the mysteries of the Christian faith, who have faithfully
set down to Posterity the sense and interpretation of the Scriptures which
they rece^ued from the Apostles.

4. Moreover, whereas no man can 2. Cor. 12. v. ^^. ^8. ^. Pet. 1. v. 20. 21.
rightly interpret the Scriptures who has not rec^aued from God the gift of
the interpretation, which is not given but to the members of Christ, and his
Church only, it is apparent enough how much more salfe it is to follow such
holy Doctors, then the impious Jews, who are wrapped in the snares of the
Devil, and h^ld 2. Tim. ^. v. v^t. Mat. 15. v. 14.
captive at his will. And seeing that saying o^ Christ is most true, if the
blind lead the blind, they hoth fall into the ditch; it cannot be but our
Adversaries, blind and destitute of the light of faith, and led by the bli^d
Jews, must needs fall down headlong, and break their necks.

5. Heerehence it is, that our Adversaries do insert into the new Translations
almost all the places of Scripture corrupted by the Jews, and that they deny
together with the Jews, many oracles of the prophets, to be understood of
Christ, and many ways wrest even those oracles which they cannot deny to be
understood of Christ, from that true sense in which they are cited in the new
Testament, by the Apostles, Evangelists, and Christ himself, to profane and
impious senses lately invented by the Jews out of their hatred to Christ.

6. The second cause is, that they desire nothing more then in their
translations to depart from the vulgar edition, the which seeing it is most
sincere and correct, they, which almost in all things lean it, must needs
fall into many errors.

7. The third cause is, the malicious intention of our Adversaries, who set
forth new Translations of the Scripture for no other end, then by them to
oppugn the Catholic doctrine, and to establish and confirm their own errors
and heresies: and therefore when any plain text occurreth, which makes
manifestly against their erroneous doctrine, they seek to make obscure the
true and proper sense, by their perverse translation; but if they light upon
any place somewhat obscure, which may seem to savor their doctrine, they so
deprave it by their new translation, that the Scripture it self may seem to
confirm what they falsely teach, and so by this means they must needs stuff
their translations with infinite corruptions. For these three reasons therefore
not without great reason Gretser: tract. de noua transtat. in defen. Bell. arm.
do we reject our Adversaries translations which so swarm with corruptions.
Many other reasons are both learnedly and largely set down by James Gretser,
which we for breuity sake omit.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Latin vulgar Edition.
OUR Adversaries convinced by the truth it self, confess sometimes, that the
vulgar Edition not only is to be preferred before all other latin Editions, but
even before the Greek text of the new Testament, and the Hebrew text of the
old: for in many places rejecting them, they follow our vulgar translation, as
may be seen in the Latin edition in the Chapters 8. 9. 10. 13. notwithstanding
that in many other places they exceedingly inueigh against, it, and with great
hostility oppugn it, partily for that they see the same to contradict in many
places their errors, and partly also, for that they labor by all means to
pervert the text of the Scripture by their new version, to make the^ speak in
favor of their error, which they cannot do, if the authority of the old Calu.
in Antid. Con^. 4. sess. Conc. Trident.
interpreter continue in all things entire and vnd^minished. As for Calvin, he
is so deadly an enemy to the vulgar edition, that with great excess he
declaimeth against it in this manner: So far off is it, says he, that there
is one entire lease, as there are s^arse three verses together not defiled
with some notable error. But to prove this his impudent a^^ertion, he brings
only one place out of the now Testament, which a little after we will show to
have been exceedingly well translated out of the Greek. He brings no other
places out of the old Testament then such as he takes out of the Psalms,
which (as it is evident) are translated word for word out of the Greek version
of the Septuagint Interpreters. Nay in the same place, Calvin acknowledges
that the Latin Interpreter has, with all possible diligence, expressed the
Greek translation. And as for the Greek interpretation of the Septuagint, it
is most learnedly defended by Genebra^d: so as it Geneb. in Psalm.
superfluous to say any more. Indeed Caluins and Luthers disciples find fault
with many other places in the vulgar edition, both of the old and new
Testament, but we will lay four general grounds, out of which all their
arguments may be easyly answered.

2. The first is: If our Aduersaires will needs have the now present Roman
Church condemned for following and authorizing the vulgar Latin Interpretation,
they must needs also condemn the whole ancient Church, and all the Fathers
who lived the first some hundred years after Christ, for they acknowledged no
other interpretation of the old Testament as authentical, then that of the
Septuagint Interpreters, which much more departs from the Hebrew text now
extant, then our vulgar Latin, as our Adversaries themselves confess: wherefore
if the Roman Church be to be condemned for the vulgar Edition, much more the
Primitive Church for the version of the Septuagint: and hereof it follows
further, that the Church is not to be condemned, which follows a translation
of the Scripture, which in some things may be amended, so long as nothing is
to be found in it, which is repugnant either to faith or good manners. For
otherwise the ancient Church had erred in retayning the version of the
Septuagint, which was corrupted in some places, but those corruptions were not
in Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 1. sect. 12.
any thing necessary to be known. Moreover Calu^ himself confesses, that we
must not depart from the Church for errors of little importance, the ignorance
whereof neither does violate Religion, nor prejudice our salvation. Wherefore
albeit there should be some such errors in the vulgar Edition, yet were not
Romans 1 v. ^. (...) Epist. 57. ad Dam.
the Roman Church, which is so aunci^nt and so highly commended by the mouth of
the Apostle (as speaks S. Jerome) to be condemned or forsaken. And this may
serve for answer to our Adversaries arguments, when they object certain light
faults of the vulgar Edition, which have crept into it, either by the
negligence of the printers, or by any other accident. As also what our
Adversaries object against the Psalter, may heerby be co^uinced to be very
weak: for seeing that no other version is followed in it, then that ancient
version of the Septuagint, they cannot condemn us, unless they will condemn
the whole primitive Church together with us, yea the Apostles and Evangelists
themselves, who followed the same version, is as showed in the 11. Chapter of
the Latin Edition of this Controversy.

3. The second ground. A good Interpreter does not tie himself to translate
word for word, seeing that every tongue has his proper phrases, and manner of
speech, but contenteth himself to express the true sense and meaning of that
which he translateth. Wherefore all our Adversaries arguments are nothing
worth, by which they prove, that certain places of the vulgar edition are
somewhat otherwise in the Hebrew and Greek, so that the sense of the whole
period be one and the same, as most of the places are which they carpe ^^ in
the vulgar Edition.

4. The third ground. The places of holy Scripture are of two sorts: some are
clear and manifest, as almost all are which set down the history of the old
and new Testament. Others are obscure, and full of difficulty, as are many
places in the Psalms and Prophets. Now, if the interpreter in such places as
are evident and manifest, do interpret rightly all of them, and in such places
of Scripture as are obscure, express a sense and meaning agreeable to the
Letter, though he come short of the best sense, and that there might be a
better given, he is not therefore to be thought to have ^rred, or not to have
fulfilled the office of a good Interpreter. For so plentifu^l and profound is
the sense o^ holy Scripture, especially in such places as are obscure, as it is
not easy for any m^^ to judge, which is the best sense. Nay if we must
interpret a new, until we have ^ound out the best sense, there will never be
an end of interpreting, but we must every year set forth a new interpretation,
or at least correct and amend the former, as our Adversaries have done, and
Beza by name, who having set out five diverse edi^ions of the new Testament Beza
in E^^st. a^ l^^t. ante deti. ^^. 1593.
every one much differing from the other, as himself freely confesses, yet he
plainly acknowledges that in his first edition he ^ath neither satisfied
either the greatness of the work, or his own desire. Out of which ground, we
answer to that which our Adversaries object, to wit, that there are many
places of the vulgar Edition, which might much better and much more clearly
have been translated: for it is sufficient that they are well, and rightly
translated.

5. The fourth ground. We are not to reprehend the translations of holy
Scripture, only because they differ one from another, so long as they are not
contrary the one to the other: and in this the holy Scripture differs from
other profane writings. For even as the holy Ghost in diverse places of holy
Scripture teaches things different, but not repugnant: so the same holy Ghost
can in one place, and in the same words teach diverse things. And heerhence it
is, that S. Thomas teaches 1. p. q. 1. art. vlt.
well, as did S. Augustine before him, that of one and the same place of
Scripture there may be many litterall senses. For where as the litterall sense
is that which the author intends, and the proper and chief author of the
holy Scripture is God himself, whose intention and meaning is not tied to one
verity only, as is man's understanding, but he in one and the same moment
comprehends all things; there is no doubt, but that he in the same words and
at the same time, can intimate unto us diverse things.

6. The which thing is excellently declared by S. Augustine, for having said
that Aug. ^. 12. ^onf. c. vlt.
he thought Moses intended diverse senses in his words* he corrects himself
saying, that without all doubt God, who is the principal author of the
Scriptures did so. O Lord, says he, seeing thou art God, and not flesh and
blood, if man he short sighted, can it be hidden from thy spirit which will
lead me into the right land, whatsoever thou wast in those words to reveal to
posterity, howsoever he by whom they were spoken, thought peradventure but of
one sense only, amo^st many other no less true; so S. Augustine. Seeing
therefore there are diverse litterall senses of one and the same place, one
Interpreter may follow one sense, and another interpreter another, so long as
neither of them do say any thing not agreeable to the word of God, but both the
one sense and the other is godly, and conformable to other places of Scripture.
And this makes much for the dignity of the Scriptures, and profit of the
Church, according to that which S. Augustine writes Lib. 3. de Doctrine. Christ.
c. 27.
else where. How could God (says he) better commend unto us the plentiful
fruit of his Divine Words, then by so disposing, as the same words may be
understood diverse ways.

7. Nay we see moreover the holy Scripture it self to show very manifestly.
that there are diverse senses of the same words. For there is no doubt, but
that commaundment of Deuteron^my, Thou shall Deuteronomy. 25. v. 4.
not the the mouth of the Ox that thresheth, according to the litter all
sense, does signify that the mouth of an ox is not to be tied whilst (...)
treads forth the corn in the floare, for so according to the Letter the
Jews observed it, as indeed they were bound to do. Nevertheless S. Paul
manifestly teaches, that God the proper Author 2. Cor. 9. v. 9. 10.
of the holy Scripture, intended chiefly another sense. Is God, says he, so
careful of Oxen, or does he not so say in regard of us? for indeed those
things are written for us; hitherto it also appertains, that in the Hebrew
tongue, one word has many significations, as has be^ne showed in the seaue^th
Chapter of the Latin Edition.

8. Out of this ground we affirm, that there is no repugnance between the
Septuagint Interpreters, and the Hebrew text, and between the Hebrew text and
the vulgar Edition, or lastly between the interpretation of the vulgar Edition
of the old Testament, and that of the new, how much soever the same words are
diversely translated, to wit, otherwise of the Septuagint, and otherwise of the
vulgar Latin interpreter, or otherwise of the vulgar Edition of the old
Testament, and otherwise of the vulgar Edition of the new, where in both places
the same words are cited: for the same places of Scripture are oftentimes
otherwise cited by the Apostles in the new Testament, then has the Hebrew text
of of the old. But here is diversity without any repugnance, or contrariety.
And this has place especially in the Hebrew text, because in the Hebrew tongue
there is so different reading of one, and the same word. See examples hereof
in the Latin Edition of this Controversy, in this Chapter.

9. It will be easy out of that which has been said to answer that which our
Adversaries object against diverse places of the vulgar edition. For albeit
there be diversity between it, and the Hebrew text, yet there is no repugnance
or contrariety: and if our Adversaries think otherwise it proceeds from their
ignorance of the Hebrew tongue, which has many words subject to ambiguity,
and very many phrases much different from the Latin and Greek phrase, as in
the Chapters that follow may be seen in the Latin Edition from the 16. to the
20.

CHAP. IX. The place of Genesis ( she shall break thy head) is showed to be
well translated.
IT will be too long, and little to my purpose to examine all the places of the
vulgar Edition, to which our Adversaries take exceptions, for many of them
differ little or nothing from the Hebrew text of the old Testament, or from the
Greek of new: we will handle some few of greatest difficulty, and which our
Adversaries do most often and with great bitterness urge against us, that by
them judgment may be given of the rest which are of less importance.

2. The first place which they say is depraved, and of which they often and
eagerly complain, is that of the third of Luther. in Genes. ib.
Genesis, v. 15. Ipsa centeret caput tuum: for it is not ipsa in the Hebrew,
but ipsum, as if it were spoken of the seed of the woman and not of the woman
her self. The Lutherans cry out of great injury done thereby to Christ, as to
whom alone it appertains to bruze the head of the Devil which we attr^bute
to another, to wit, to the Blessed Virgin.

3. Calvin also affirms, that we Calu. in. c. 3. Genesis v. 15.
have found out a sacrilegious Exposition, whilst we accommodate that to the
holy Mother of Christ which was spoken of the seed, Christ himself. And as for
the Lutherans, we have less cause to blame the for reprehending our version,
seeing they stoutly maintain, that by the seed ^^ the woman Chrill only is
meant,

4. But as for Calvin, he shows the greedy appetite he has to calumniate
when he calls our version a sacrilegious exposition, for he convinced by the
truth, confesses that by the seed of the woman not only Christ is meant, but
al his members, ye^ even all mankind. It is therefore wonderful that he says,
it is a sacrilegious expesition, to apply to the Blessed Virgin Mary, that
which was spoken of the seed, unless ^e will not, that the Blessed Virgin be
any member of Christ, or to appertain any thing to mankind. For seeing that
the promise of bruzing Satha^s head appertains to Christ, and every member of
his (a^ Calvin writes in express words) Calu. l. 1. Inst. c. 14. sect. 13^
it must doubtless principally apperthyne to the Blessed Virgin, as who next
after Christ, has most strongly crushed Satan's head. Wherefore even the
Lutheran^ Hun. in Caln. Iudaiza^te, and in Anti. paraeo.
themselves observe, that Calvin has no reason to obi^ct this unto the
Catholics.

5. But to the end we may the better understand whether it be any fault at all,
that we retain in the vulgar version the particle ( ips^) we are first to
declare the litteral sense of this place, and to examine after, whether it be
any error, that we retain the particle ( ipsa) in our version. For it was not
out of any ignorance or drowsy carelesnes, that the feminine gender crept in
he^re, i^st^^d of the masculine, or neuter, as Calvin calumniateth, but it was
In Genesis loc. cit.
done of purpose, and for just cause, as shall be showed.

CHAP. X. Of the true sense of these words: Ipsa conteret etc.
THAT we may find out the true sense of these words, we must first resute the
false expositions of our Adversaries. The Luthera^s by the seed of the woman
will needs have Christ only to be meant: we confess in deed that he is
principally meant thereby, and that therefore the place may be well understood
of Christ, as many ancient Fathers have expounded it, but that Christ alone is
meant hereby, and not his members, we deny to be the literal sense for the
reason following.

2. First it is evident, that the seed of the Serpent which is opposed against
the seed of the woman, does not signify any one Serpent, but a multitude: it is
therefore very probable, that by the seed of the woman a multitude also is
signified, unless we will have the Scripture in so few words speak
ambiguously. Moreover semen is a Nowne collectiue, properly signifying a
multitude, neither is there any thing in this sentence that forces us to
depart from the proper signification of the Word. This reason is of so great a
force, that Calvin was moved thereby to forsake the exposition of the Lutherans,
which he would otherwise willingly have embraced, the more strongly to assault
us, for thus he writes: Some make no doubt, but Christ alone is Calu. in Genesis
loco ^it.
meant by the seed of the woman, whose exposition I could willingly approve,
but that I see they offer too great violence to the word (seed:) for who will
grant, that a Nowne collectiue is to be taken for one man only? Thus Calvin.
So strong is the truth, that it extorteth a true confession from her greatest
enemy.

3, Secondly it is said of the seed of the woman, that it shall crush, and
bruze the head of the Serpent, but this crushing and bruzing the Scripture does
not attribute to Christ alone, but to all that lead a godly life in him, for to
every just man the holy Ghost speaks, saying: Thou thalt walk over the Addar
and Basiliske, and thou Psalm. 90. v 13.
shall tread under thy feet the Lion and the Dragon. And Christ says unto his
Disciples: Behold I have given you power to tread upon the Serpents and
Scorpions, and upon all the power of Luc. 10. v. 19.
the enemy. And the Apostle to the Romans prays saying: The God of peace
cru^h Satan under your seete quickly. And lastly in very many places of
Scripture the faithful Romans 16. v. 20.
are said to overcome the Devil, and to get victories against him, which is
all one as to crush him. Seeing therefore the proper work of this seed agrees
also 1. Joan. 2. v. 13. Apoc. 12. v. 11. 1. Cor. 15. v. 57.
to the members of Christ, the Word seed is not to be limited to Christ alone.
Ad hereunto, that God in these words intended to comfort not only Eve deceived
by the craft of the Devil, but all her posterity. Now the comfort is more
general, if all the faithful should be able by Christ to overcome the Devil,
th^n if that Christ alone should overcome him, even as our comfort is greater
that we together with Christ shall rise again, then if Christ only should
rise, and be alon^ attain to eternal life.

4 Thirdly* Albeit we should grant our Adversaries, that Christ alone does
crush the head of the D^uell, which is the former part of the sentence: yet the
latter part can by no means b^ applied to Christ alone, where it said, that
the Devil shall crush this seed, for Christ in his own person cannot be
crushed by the Devil: we must therefore needs by this seed understand also
the members of Christ, for in the Hebrew text it is thus word for word, ipsa,
vel ipsum, co^teret t^ in capite, and ^^^^teres ^um, v^lea^, in calc^^^, for
the Hebrew word is the same in both places both in the first and in the later
part of the sentence, and signifies cont^^^re.

5. As for Caluins exposition interpreting In Genesis loc. cit. lib. 1. Instit. c.
13. sect. 2.
by the seed of the woman al mankind, it is not to be received; for God in this
place denounces emnity between the seed of the Serpent, and the seed of the
woman but infidells and ungoodly persons have no emnity with the Devil, and
his seed* but are rather the seed and sons of the Devil, according to those
words of Christ: Y^^ are of your father the Devil; they therefore cannot
appertain to this seed Joan. 8. v. 44.
of the woman.

6. But wh^r^as Calvin in another place says, that Christ and his members are
signified by the seed of the woman, we Calu. l. 1. Instit. c. 14 sect. 18.
like well of that his saying, for it is the exposition of the Catholic and
ancient Fathers, and indeed the true litterall sense.

7. For in that sentence God says, first that he will put emnity: wherefore he
speaks not of any natural emnity, ^^ Calvin insinuates, but of a super
natural proceeding from God. Moreover God signifies between whom this
emnity shall be, to wi^, between the Serpent and woman. Now as by the Serpent
the Devil is meant, whom that natural Serpent represented, and in whom God
laid his curse upon the Devil: so by the woman E^e, is meant the spouse of
Christ, or his true Church represented by E^e, whose force and victory against
the Devil was therefore foretold by God: for that Eve represented* the Ephesians. 5.
v. 32. 2. Cor. 11. v. 2. and 3.
Church, as Adam did Christ, the Apostle plainly teaches in his Epistle to
the Ephesians. and the same Apostle does therefore elsewhere expound this place of
Satan, and the Church, as does S. John in his Apocalyp^ Apoc. 1^. v. 13. 17.
where he declares this emnity between the Woman and the Serpent, to be
indeed the emnity between the Church of Christ and the Devil: wherefore here
by the Serpent is signified the Devil, by the woman the Church, by the seed of
the Serpent the Children of the Devil, and all the wicked who are aliens from
Christ and his Church, but especially such as seduce others and Mat. 1^. v ^8.
Apoc. ^^. v. 17.
oppugn the Church. The seed of the woman are the Children of the Church,
especially such as keep Gods commaundments, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ, as S. John speaks.

8. Furthermore, this woman, to wit the Church shall crush the head of the
Serpent, as we have proved by many places of Psalm 90. v. 1^. Luc. 10. v. 19.
Romans 16. v. 20.
Scripture. But on the other side the woman's heel^ shall be crushed by Satan, for
the Church overcomes the Devil by her chief and more excellent members, but
she is overcome in such her members as are base and worldly given, which set up
their rest here upon earth, and taste no other things, but such as are terrene
and earthly; worthily therefore signified by Defuga saec. c. 7.
the heel of the Church: let us not therefore, says S. Ambrose, walk by love
and affection upon the earth, and the Serpent cannot hurt us. In the first
combat is, that the Church ouercometh by open war, and therefore it is
expressed by crushing of the head. In the later combat in which a part of the
Church is overcome, the enemy proceeds by guiles and deceites, and therefore
that combat is signified by crushing the heel, for the Hebrew word signifying
calcaneum, does signify also properly insidiari, Oleast. i^ c. 3. Genesis
and ex insidij^ aggredi, as appears by many places of Scripture. And out of
ignorance heerof Calvin without cause reprehendeth the vulgar Interpreter, for
otherwise explicating this combat in the later part of the sentence then he had
in the forme^: for the Emphasis, or force of the Hebrew word required that he
should interpret the later part as he did, by these words, tu insidiab^ris
calcan^^ ^ius, which is as much to say, as thou shall crush her heel, not by
open war, but by taking her at unawares. See further of this matter in this
Chapter in the Latin Edition the 8. ^. And you shall see that our Adversaries
make a great ado about a matter of small moment, if the words be rightly
understood. For whether we read ipsa, and so refer it to the Church, or
ipsum, that it may be referred to the children of the Church, the sense is all
one, for it is all on to say, the seed of the woman shall crush the he^^ of the
Serpent, or the Children of the Church shall do it. And heerehence it is, that
the ancient Fathers, whether they read ipse, as S. Hierome and S. Chrysostom
do, or ipse, Hier in tradit. Hebr. Hom. 17. in Genesis Amb. de fug ^ saec. e. 7.
Greg. in. Job. c. 38.
as read S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Gregory, and other Latin Fathers, all of
them expound this place of the Church.

9. Howsoever it be, the reading of the vulgar Edition is to be preferred
before the other, for this victory is rather to be attributed to the Church, as
to the Mother of all the faithful, and to her who continues for ever,
according to that promise of Christ, the gates of hell shall not preuail
against her, then to her children or members, which are every day changed, for
this promise is an explication of the promise made by God in Genesis, for the
head of the Serpent, and the gates of hell signify Mat. 16. v. 18.
one and the same thing. And if the victory be attributed to the woman, that
is, to the Church, all things are better explicated, for God first did
foretell the emnity that was to be between the woman and the Serpent, and
afterward he makes mention of the seed of the woman and the Serpents seed, so
as the woman is opposed to the Serpent, and the seed of the one to the seed
of the other; but the victory promsed, is said to be gotten against the Serpent
himself, and not against the seed: wherefore the same appertains rather to
the woman her self then to her seed, for the words following (between thy
seed and her seed) do not properly signify any new combat, but a continuance of
that combat which was between the woman and the serpent, and are put in by way
of pare^thesis for the combat of the Church, and of her children is all one
combat.

10. But the chief cause that moved the Church to retain at this time rather
the word ipsa, then ipsum, or ipse, was to control the error of the Lutherans,
for if the reading had been ipsum, or ipse, one might have thought this promise
to have appertayned only to Christ, as they (though erroneously) would have it,
but by reading ipsa, this promise must needs be understood to have been made to
the whole Church. For such is the custom of the holy Church, whether she
interpret the Scripture or administer the Sacraments, to do all as is most
profitable and most for the edification of the faithful. Neither is Christ
hereby excluded but he is rather included in the name of the Church, a^ is also
the holy Ghost, for the true Church of Christ cannot consist or do any thing
that is good without the help of her supreme head Christ, and the assistance of
his holy spirit. That the reading according to the Hebrew text is ipsa, or
ipsissima, and not ipsum, or ipse, is learnedly proved in the next Chapter of
the Latin Edition of this Controversy, to which I refer the Reader, and to
the Chapters following, in which other places of the vulgar Edition are
defended.

CHAP. XI. That the written Word, is no fit Judge of Controversies, concerning
matters of Faith.
OUR Adversaries in the beginning did stiffly mayntaine that the holy Scripture
was to be the only judge of all Controversies which arise in matters of faith:
but when they were told, that to make the Scripture a judge was as much as to
say, the Scripture did hear, speak, and live, for all these appertain to a
judge, and that nothing is more unreasonable the^ to assign such a judge of
Controversies, as can neither hear, nor speak, but is utterly void of life;
changing their opinion, they begin Iun. co^tra Bell. Cont. 1. l. 3. c. 3. nota
9. etc. 9. nota E. and 10.
now to say that the Scripture is improperly called a judge, and that to speak
properly, the holy Ghost only is the judge. And thus having for many years
together spoken improperly, now at last they fly to the holy Ghost, of whom
there is no doubt, but that he is the supreme Robert. Ro^oc. de vocat. effic.
c. ^5^
judge of all.

2. But they should have added further, that the holy Ghost at this time does
not immediately propose any new revelations to any particular man concerning
points of faith, but only proposes verities already revealed, and that by the
mouth of the Church, as shall be showed hereafter in the next Controversy, where
we shall have occasion to say more of this matter. Whosoever therefore
contemns the judgment of the Church, in so doing, he despises the judgment
of Christ, and of the holy Ghost, for Christ himself says, Luc. 10. v. 16.
he that despyseth you, despyseth me. Neither does the holy Ghost speak by the
Scripture, but when it is rightly understood, which is never but when we
embrace the interpretation of the Catholic Church, as we have already showed
in the fourth Chapter.

CHAP. XII. Whether the Scriptures be obscure, or hard to be understood.
THE Word of God is either written, or unwritten and preached. Now certain it
is, that the Word preached is not obscure, for it is not hidden from such as
perish: the question therefore is of the written Word. ^ Cor. 4. v. 3.
Our Adversaries in the beginning did teach that the whole Scripture was easy,
and no part thereof hard to be understood, but after that, not only many obscure
places, but even whole Chapters out of the Canticle of Canticles, out of
Ezethiel, and other Prophets were objected by the Catholics, Beza de not.
Ec^l. Vol. 3. p. 137. edit. an. 158.
they changing their mind confess that very many places of Scripture are
obscure, but that all points of doctrine necessary to salvation, are be found
in places plain and easy.

2. For resolution of this question, we must answer with a distinction, and
say, that if the word Scripture be taken for the bare Letter only, then
doubtless the ^ Cor. 3. v. 6. 7. 9.
Scripture is obscure, or ^ls S. Paul would not have said, that it kills, and
causes death and damnation; but if it be taken properly, that is to say,
together with the true sense and meaning thereof, then it is not obscure but
plain enough in all things necessary to salvation: and in this sense speaks
S. Augustine, as do also other Fathers l. 3. de doct. Christ. c. 7. and 9.
whom our Adversaries cite when they say, that al things necessary to salvation
are manifestly contained in the holy Scripture.

3. Moreover the holy Scripture is both manifest, and obscure, but not in
regard of the same persons. It is passing obscure and not to be understood of
the proud, such I mean, as despise the sense and consent of the holy Fathers,
yea and of the whole Catholic Church, but to little ones and such as are
humble, who follow in all things the foresaid sense and consent, it is manifest
Psalm. 18. v. 8.
and perspicuous. The testimony of our Lord is faithful (says the Psalmist)
giving wisdom to the little ones, that is, to such as are humble and not
proud: and Christ our Lord says, thou have hidden these things from Matt. 11.
v. 25.
the wise, and revealed them to little ones, that is to the humble. The
Scripture indeed is obscure to such as want faith, and are destitute of the
holy Ghost, but easy and plain to those which abide and preseuere in the faith
of the Church, and by that means are guided and governed by the holy Ghost.

4. The Word of God shines brightly, the Word of God, I say, not the word of
men, nor the word of the Devil, for that only is the true Word of God which is
in the true sense, and not in the bare letter; for the letter depraved by a
false sense is not the Word of God, but the word of men, or rather the word of
the Devil: the word of God does illuminate the eyes, but the 2. Cor. 4. v. 41.
eyes of such as have eyes to see, and not their eyes whose minds Satan has
blinded, so as the light of the Gospel cannot shine to them.

5. In vain therefore do our Adversaries heap together so many places of
Scripture, in which it is said, that the Word of God is said to be clear, full
of light, and perspicuous, for this is not attributed by the Scripture to the
bare letter, but to the letter joined with the true sense, which true sense
cannot be had out of the Catholic Church.

6. Neither does the Scripture say, that the Word of God is manifest to all
indifferently, but to such only, as being endued with the true faith, are
humble of heart, and therefore inspired by the holy Ghost; if therefore our
Adversaries will have the Scripture to be full of light, and easy to be
understood of them, it it necessary that they return again to the true
Church, in which only is true faith, true humility, the true sense of the
Scripture. and the true spirit of God, without which the holy Scripture will
never be plain, clear and manifest: for it is great imprudency, I will not
say impudency, to contend so eagerly, and with such hostility about the
plainenes and perspicuity of the holy Scripture, and to have no will to return
into that way, which only leads to plainenes and perspicuity.

CHAP. XIII. Whether the holy Scripture be to be translated into the vulgar
tongue.
THAT we may briefly dispatch that which has been so largely treated of by
many concerning this matter, we will reduce all unto four general assertions.
The first is; There is no doubt but the Word of God is to be preached to the
people in the vulgar tongue, so as the question is only of the bare written
letter.

2. The second assertion is; Neither the example of Christ, nor of the
Primitive Church do convince that the Scripture is to be translated into the
vulgar tongue, but rather the contrary, for Christ never commanded the Jews
to translate the Scriptures out of the Hebrew tongue into the Sy^iac, and yet
in Christ's time the aun^ient Hebrew tongue was to the Jews, as the Latin is to
the Ere^ch, Italians, and Spaniards, and only the Syriac tongue was in use
amongst the common people, which even our Adversaries confess, such I mean as
are the more skillfull in the Syriac, and Hebrew tongues, as namely these,

Grammar printed a^ Ro^hel the year 1590.

3. Neither did S. Paul write in Latin to the Romans but in Greek, though
Hier. de Script. Eccles. in Luc. See S. Aug. l. 2. de doct. Christ. c. 11. and
seq.
not the Greek tongue but the Latin was their vulgar tongue. So S. Luke did
^rite the acts of the Apostles at Rome in Greek and not in Latin. And even to
S. Augustines time four hundred years after Christ, the Bible was not extant
but in the three learned tongues, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, no not in the time
of Rabbanus* Maurus, who lived Rab. l. 5. de inst. Cler. c. 8.
eight hundred years after Christ, as himself testifyeth in express words.

4. Neither can our Adversaries allege any authentical example of the
ancient Church for the translation of the Scripture into the vulgar tongue:
they tell us indeed of one Vulphil^s a Bishop of the Goths, who is said to
have translated the Scripture into the Gothish tongue, but he was not a
Catholic, but an Arian Heretic, as witness Theodoret, Theod. l. 4. hist.
Ecc. cap. vl^. Socr. lib. 4. c. 27. Sozom. l. 6. c. 37. Cass in hist. tripart.
l. 8. c. 13.
Socrates, Sozomenus, and Cassiodorus.

5. For as for that which certain late writers allege of S. Cl^ysostome his
translating of the Scripture into the Armenian tongue, as also of S. Hierome
his translating of the same into the Dalmatical tongue, there can no certain
proof be brought thereof, And they who write this, do not affirm, that all
the Scripture was translated by them, but certain parts only used of old to
be read in the prayers of the Church, as the Psalms, Epistles, Ghospels, and
Lessons, which were song publickely at Mass, and in the Canonical hours,
which we read to have been granted by Pope John the eight of that name, to the
Morauians at their first Conversion to the faith of Christ, but this was 880.
years after Christ, and this custom was of no long continuance amongst them,
as appears Baron. Tom. 10. an. 880. n. 19. and Tom. 11. an. 1080. n. 1.
by that which Pope Gregory the s^auenth writes to the Duke of Bohemia, and is
to be seen in Caesar Baronius.

6. The third assertion; To translate the Scripture into the vulgar tongue is
neither in it self unlawful, nor forbidden by any Ecclesiastical law, so it
be truly translated. Nay such a translation serves Preachers to great use, who
are to cite and expound the Scriptures to the people in the vulgar tongue.
Heretical translations are indeed forbidden, especially of the new Testament,
because in them many places of holy Scripture are by false translating
corrupted.

7. The fourth assertion; It is not a thing profitable to all to read the
Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, yea to many it is rather pernicious: for we
are taught by ^. Pet. vlt. v. 26.
the Apostle S. Peter, that in the Scriptures are many things hard to be
understood, which unlearned, and unstayed persons deprave to their own
destruction. Many also there are incapable of meat and solid sustenance, who
are therefore to be ^. Cor. 3. v. 2. Heb. ^. v. 12.
fed with milk, as the Apostle speaks, and for such it is more wholesome to
be fed by the sermons and instructions of their Pastors, then to feed
themselves with reading the Bible. It was therefore great prudence of the
Church to forbid that the Bible, though translated and set forth by Catholics,
should be read of Index li. ^roh^^. Reg. 4.
all indifferently, and without the approbation and leave of the Bishop,
Pastor, or Ghostly Father.

8. Our Adversaries object certain places of S. Chrysostom, and S. Hierome,
in which they exhort to the reading of the Scripture, but they should have
observed, that those Fathers speak of reading the Scripture in the Greek
tongue then extant, or in the Latin according to the old edition, which was
never forbidden to any by the Church: whereas our Controversy is about the
translations of the holy Scripture out of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin into the
vulgar tongue, which are all for the most part corrupted.

9. And it is worthy the noting, that our Adversaries spend their time in
vain, in gathering together arguments by which to persuade men, that it is
necessary for them to read the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, to the end they
may learn out of them what they must necessarily know if they will be saved, for
how truly or plainly soever they be translated, no man shall ever receive any
fruit by them, unless he first believe aright, and be guided by the holy
Ghost, to whom it appertains to guide us into the right Psalm 142. v. 8. and
1^.
land, to make known unto us the way in which we are to walk, to teach us the
will of God which we are to fulfill. Which is manifestly to be seen in the
Jews who understand the Hebrew text much better then Christians, in which
there is so ample and clear mention of Christ, and yet for all that they do
not believe in Christ. Our Adversaries therefore have little reason to keep
such ado about the words of Scripture, or the translation of them: let them
first embrace the true Faith which is in the Church only, let them seek after
the holy Ghost who is not to be found out of the Church, let them seek out the
true sense of the Letter, which the Church only conserueth vncorrupteed, and it
will easily be granted unto them to have the Scriptures in what tongue soever
they will, so they be truly and vncorruptedly translated, and that they use
them to their own salvation, and not to their destruction, as many do, whereof
we have for witness not only the Scripture but daily experience. And this
shall suffice concerning the translation of the Scripture into the vulgar
tongue.

10. For of the prayers in Latin either privately made by the people, or
publicly offered by the Priest at mass, and in the administration of the
Sacramo^ts, we will treat hereafter in their proper places.

CHAP. XIII. That our Adversaries use many sleightes in corrupting the Word of
God.
OUR Adversaries often require us to prove all that which we say out of the
written Word of God, but when we cite the same in express terms, they have
many ways by which they deprave it. Wherefore before I make an end of this
Controversy concerning the written Word, it shall not be from the purpose
briefly to detect such their corruptions; partly to the end that no man be
deceived by them, and partly that every man may understand nothing to be so
plainly and clearly set down in the written Word, which by the Commentaries
of crafty and subtle wits may not be weakened and made of little force, if no
regard be had to the authority and judgment of the Church. And that no man may
think that I herin calumniate them, or deal less sincerely with them, I will
set down out of their own writings some one or two exa^pls of each manner of
corrupting, whereof many will occure in each Controversy.

2. The first manner of shifting of places alleged out of the written Word,
is to say, that the original text is corrupted, and what is alleged is crept
out of the margent into the text, whereof see many examples in the 12. and 18.
Chapter of the Latin Edition of this Co^ttouersy.

3. Their second shift is to reject the vulgar translation, and instead thereof
to cite some new and corrupt translation of their own. It is evident enough,
that Luther in his first version of the new Testament into the German tongue,
set forth in the year 1522. has more then a thousand e^rors, as many have
observed, amongst Ioannes Cocl eus de actis Luther. an. 1522.
which neither the last, nor the least is his presuming to add to the text of
S. Paul the 3. Chapter and 28. verse, the particle alone, thereby the
stronglier to establish his doctrine, that Faith alone justifies, for this
place of the Apostle, We think a man i^ Romans 3. v. 28.
justified by faith, he tra^slateth by says alone: and when a certain friend
of his, to whom the same was objected by a Catholic, asked the cause why he
so translated it, he no less ridiculously then proudly answers, in a
certain little book set forth by him in the year 1530. under this title: A
certain information or answer made to two questions proposed by a certain
good friend, concerning the translation of Scripture, and the invocation of
Saints. In which he advises his friend to answer the Catholics objection
after this manner. D. Martin Luther Luth. ^0. 4. Germ. excuso VVittemb. an.
1551. fol. 475.
will have it so, and says, that a Papist and an Ass i^ all one thing: so I
will, so I command, let my will stand for a reason: for we will not be the
papists scholars* but their Judges. Luther will have it so and he says, that
he is a Doctor above all the popes D^ctors. So Luther, concluding at last that
the word (alone) shall remain in his new Testament, though it should make all
his Adversaries mad: and he adds further, that he is only sorry, that he had
not added two words more to the text, and translated it after this manner, we
are justified by only faith, without any works of any law.

4. Zwinglius also who first in our age endeauored to persuade many, that the
body of Christ is not really contained in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the
better to establish this his error, goes about to Zuing. l. de vera and falsa
relig. c. de Euchar.. 202. in lib. excuso Tiguri. 1555.
prove that those words of Christ, this is my b^dy* are very well translated
thus, this signifies my body, and with this his new translation he is so
ravished, as if he had received the same from heaven, for these are his words:
So therefore has Luke, with whom we content our selves, without citing any
other Evangelist: And having taken bread, he gave thanks, brake it, and gave
it them, saying, This signifies my body which is given for you, do this in
remembrance of me. Thou see O faithful soul, but yet wrapped in absurd
opinions, how all things here agree, and nothing is violently either taken
away or added, so as thou have cause to wonder, that thou have not been always
of this opinion, and much more that any dare so boldly tear and rent the body
of this speech so well joined together. So Zwinglius in the praise of his new
translation, wherein he arrogates more authority to himself the^ is due, so as
that of Cicero in his book de diuinatione may well be applied to him, I never
saw any man arrogate greater authority to himself, and in the end say just
nothing.

5. Moreover concerning Caluins and Bezas errors in translating, or rather
perverting the holy Scriptures, whole books Calu l. 2. instit. c. 16. and. in
c. 26. Matt. v. 39. and inc 27. ^^a^th. v. 46. Item in Catech. Dom. 10. Bez. in
c. 5. ad Heb. v. 7. and. tra^ct. Theol. page 657. iuxta edit. Geneu. 1582.
are extant, as also of the corruptions of the Geneua Bibles, which are every
year increased, but this shall much more commodiously be declared hereafter in
the particular Controversies. We will only here set down one example of a
corruption to be found in Caluins, Bezas, and all the Geneua Bibles. And this
coruption is forged of purpose by them to confirm a new and notable blasphemy
against Christ and himself, by some apparent testimony of Scripture: for they
teach in many places that Christ when he prayed in the Garden was seized with
an extreme fear, least God being angry with him for our sins, for which he
had taken upon him to satisfy, should inflict upon him eternal damnation:
neither did Christ fear without cause, for they say he suffered upon the
Cross the pains of a damned person, and the torments of hell; for these are
the impio^s words of Calvin: Christ suffered in his soul the torments of a
forlorn, and damned man: and Beza says, at what time Christ hang upon the
Cross, he was in the midst even of the torments of hell, which is as much,
as to say, that God himself was not only afraid of the torments of hell, but
that he suffered and endured them, for it is evident that Christ was true God.
But against these absurd Paradoxes we are to dispute hereafter. It shall
suffice here to show, that they have depraved the holy Scripture, to fortify
this their impious assertion: for whereas it is written in the fifth to the
Hebrews, Heb. 5. v. 7.
and 7. v. that Christ was heard, of God, for his reverence, Calvin first, and
after Beza, and all the Geneua Bybles, make the text to say, Christ was heard
by reason of his fear, or because he was afraid, but that in Bez. annot. anni
1598.
the last Edition Beza has added more words to the text, making it sound thus:
His prayer being heard, he was delivered fr^^ this fear. Moreover Calvin in
his commentaries and Beza in his annotations seek to prove out of this text,
that Christ feared eternal damnation, and that he was delivered out of this
fear by his prayers which he offered with tears: true it is, that in the
French Bibles lately printed at Geneua, in the year 1605. they have put in the
margent, vel pro sua reuerentia, where enforced by truth they manifestly
contradict Calvin and Beza, who plainly deny, that this place is so to be
translated: yet least their inconstancy should be noted, they leave the former
words in the text ( ayant este exauce de ce qu' il craignoit) that is in latin,
exauditus est ex ^o, vel in eo, quod timuit.

6. But all others as well Catholics, as their Aduersaires who have written
before Calvin, translate pro sua reuerentia, vel pro pietate sua, as Erasmus,
Bucer, the Tigurines in their Bibles of the year 1542. Nay Sebastian Castalio
for this cause sharply reprehendeth Castal. in defen. suae translat. Bibl. in
fine.
Castalio for this cause sharply reprehendeth Beza, who glories, that Calvin
was the first that found out this new explication, in a note of his upon this
7. v. See his editions the year 1560. and 1565.

7. The third shift is, their false exposition of the text though never so
truly translated, for by diverse commentaries and little notes in the margent,
they go about to persuade their Readers the clean contrary to that which is
expressly in the text. See examples hereof in this Chapter in the latin
edition.

CHAP. XV. The fourth, fifth, and sixth shift, that our Adversaries use in
deprauing the Word of God.
THE fourth shift of our Adversaries is to fly to figurative and metaphorical
speeches, for it is most true, that was Aug. l. 3 dedoct. Christ. cap. 10.
wittily observed by S. Augustine, If (says he) the mind be preoccupated with
any erroneous opinion, whatsoever the Scripture says to the contrary, men take
to be a figurative speech. And surely there is no kind of figurative speaking
to which our adversaries at one time or another have not recourse: but there
are three figures of which our Adversaries do oftenest serve themselves in
deprauing the holy Scriptures, which Matt. ^^. v. 26. Cal^. l. 4. Instit. c.
17. sect. 21.
are these, Metonymia, Hyperbole, and Ironia. Metonymia is a figure very
familiar with Calvin, for by it he peruerteth many places of Scripture, yea
even those plain words of Christ, this is my body: for having disputed long
about the sense of those words at last he concludes thus: I omit (says he)
Allegories and Parables, least any man should think that I seek euasions, and
to go from the matter in hand, I say it is a Metonymicall speech. So Calvin.

2. By the figure Hyperbole our Adversaries shift of all those so evident
testimonies, by which we prove that remission Tob 4. v. 26. Tob. 12. v. 9.
Eccl. 3. v. 33.
of sins is obtained of God by good works, as are these: Alms delivers
from all sins and death, and suffers not the soul to go into darkness. And
again, Alms delivers from death, and it is that that purges sin, and
makes us find mercy and life everlasting. Moreover water puts out a burning
fire, and Alms resists sin: for the Lutherans say, that all these are
Hyperbolicall Apel. confess. August. tit. de Iustif. Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14.
sect. vit. Ca^^s. in c. 6. Matt. v. 16. and inc. 24. v. 82. Luc. vlt. v.
speeches. Beza also seeks to extenuat by the figure Hyperbole that which the
Apostle writes in the praise of the Roman Church, when he says, your faith is
preached all over the world, Calvin in like manner by the same figure not only
depraueth many places of the ancient Fathers, but will needs force Christ
himself without any need at all, to speak Hyperbolically. And finally Philip
Melancthon goes about by the figure Ironia to occlude all those manifest
words of Christ, That which remains; give Alms, and behold all things are
clean unto you. For Philip contendeth that Christ Erasm. in a^not. in Luc.
Calu. and Beza in illa verba S. Luc.
spoke not those words in earnest, but in jest, which he took from Erasmus, as
he did many other things: but Calvin and Beza confess, that this is a foolish
Ironia: A^beit they also pervert the same words another way, for they
restrain the word omnia, only to meat.

3. The fifth shift is, when Catholics allege plain places of Scripture which
admit no figure, to say, that the Scripture, yea even Christ himself did
speak exactly, but after a gross and popular manner, the meaning is, that he
speaks only probably, and not solidly. For example sake, when we prove that
the Sacrament of the Eucharist excels the Manna of the Jews by these words
of Christ, your Fathers Joan 6. 48. and 49
indeed have eaten Manna and are dead, this is the bread descending from
heaven, that if any man eat of it, he dye not, Caluins answer is, that l. 4.
Instit. c 14. sect. 25.
Christ accommodated his speech to the gross conceit or opinion of the Jews.
When we prove the Exorcismes of the Church, by which she casts out devils,
to be holv, because Christ says, one Devil will not cast out another, Calvin
answers, We Call. in illum v 25. Matthew. 12.
must remember (says he) that when Christ v seth such proverbs, as are in use
among the people, he uses them only, as probable conjectures, and not as solid
proofs. So he. No marvel therefore, it our Adversaries say our arguments be
not solid, seeing they write so much of Christ's own arguments.

4. Their sixth shift is, to answer to such plain testimonies as are alleged
out of Scripture against their errors, that the Scripture speaks not simply,
that is to say, not truly, but according to the false opinion of them, against
whom it has to do, which indeed is nothing else, but to deny the Scripture.
This is an usual shift of Calvin, who interprets to dispute by Call. 2.
instit c. 11. sect. 7.
contention, to be all one, as to dispute not according to our own mind, but
according to their error, and foolish affection, who obscure the light of the
Gospel. So as when we prove that our Sacraments excel the Sacraments of the
old law, because S. Paul says, that the ceremonies of the Coloss. 2. v. 17.
Jews were shaddows of things to come, but Christ the body it self. And
again, that the Sacrifices of the law could not make perfect according to
conscience, Heb. 9. v. 9. and 13.
but served only to sanctification and cleansing of the flesh: and lastly, that
they could not take away sin. To all these places Calvin answers. Heb. 10.
v. 11. Call. l. 4. Inst. cap 14. sect. 25.
Wear, says he to observe diligently that the Apostle S. Paul in all these
places speaks not simpliciter, sed per conte^^onem, which what it is to say,
we have interpreted out of Calvin before.

CHAP. XVI. Of the seventh and eight shift.
THEIR seventh shift is, when they are urged with express words of Scripture,
to say that they are to be understood before men, and not before God, or in
truth. This shift Calvin and Beza use often, for thus they rid themselves of
these places: Every branch that brings not forth fruit in me, he will Joan.
15. v. 2. Calu. Ibid.
cut off Calvin here co^tendeth that the evil which believe in God, are in
Christ only in the estimation of men, and not indeed: whereof it follows,
that the words of Christ are thus to be understood, to wit, that the evil
seem indeed to men to be in Christ, but are not so in truth.

2. That place also of S. James, Man is Iac. 2. 24 Beza and Calu. in illa verba.
justified by works, and not by faith alone, is interpreted by Calvin and
Beza, and almost all other our Adversaries of Justification before men, and not
before God. See more examples in this Chapter in the latin edition.

3. The eight shift is* when they know not what to answer, to say, it is an
improper speech, and by this occasion to change the words of the Scripture into
other words of their own forging. For when we cite the words of Christ in
which a reward is promised to fasting and prayer, Calvin turns them of with
this answer, Calu. in c. ^. Matt. v. 4.
when Christ, says he, promises a reward from God for fasting, he speaks
improperly, as is said a little before, concerning prayer. Likewise when to
prove Freewill, we allege those Matt. 12. v 33. Calu. ibid.
words of Christ, to wit, make the tree good, Cal^^n answers, it is an
improper speech.

CHAP. XVII. Of the ninth, and tenth shift.
THEIR ninth shift is, when the words of Scripture are so plain and manifest,
that they cannot otherwise escape, they say at last, that the Scripture
commends unto us a thing impossible: and to make this shift more probable,
the^ corrupt the text by adding the particle (si) as if the Scripture spoke
conditionally, and not absolutely: for when we cite the places of Scripture in
which life everlasting is promised to such as Matt. 19. v. 17. Luc 10. v. 28.
keep Gods Commandments, as when Christ says, If thou will enter into life,
keep the commandments; And again, do this and thou shall live: The answer of
Calvin and Beza is, that Christ in these words speaks of a thing impossible.
Calvin upon the former place Calu. in 29. Matt. v. 17.
writes (...): Some of the ancient Fathers, says he, have interpretea this
place amiss, as do the Papists after them, as if Christ should teach, that we
cold deserve life everlasting by keeping the law. And a little after he
concludes, saying: This answer of Christ is according to the old law, to wit,
that no man can be accounted just before God, but he who shall satify the law,
which is impossible. And Calu. in 16. Luc. v. 28. L^b. 3. Instit. c. 17. sect.
7.
upon the later place he writes thus: It is impossible, says he, to fulfill
what the law commands: yea it is a principal axiom with Calvin, and a
common a^swere to all such places. A legal promise, says he, a^nexed to a
condition impossible proves nothing, and thus with such impossibilities they
dally with us, and with the holy Scripture it self: so far forth, as they
Calu. and Beza in c. 2. ad Romans
dare affirm, that the Apostle in one Chapter auo^cheth unto us seven times
things im^ossible. For whereas the Apostle in the 2. cap. of the Ep. to the
Romans and 6. v. affirms Bez. in c. 2. ad R^. v. 6. annot. 6. edit* an. 1550.
1564. 1565.
first, that God will render to every one according to his works, they
interpret the place thus; that God will indeed give to me^ according to their
good works if there were any such, but that no man can do any good work before
God. Is there any man, says Beza, that shall be able to bring these works which
the Apostle says shall be rewarded with eternal life? And whereas in the
seaue^th v. the Apostle says, that God does render life everlasting to such as
seek the same by the patience of good works, their answer is, that, he
insinuates a thing impossible, and that, no man can do any good work before
God, no not the iuslest man, which is not worthy of eternal damnation. Calu.
l. 3. Instit. c. 19. sect. 4.
Whosoever, says Calvin, have made the greatest progress before all others
in the way of the Lord, if they cast their eyes upon the Lord God, what work
soever they attempt, or go about, they see it to be accursed. And surely I for
my part, could easily believe that such is the progress of our aduersarirs in
the way of our Lord. See the rest of the Aposiles places in the latin edition.

2. The tenth and last shift is the wresting of diverse words to a wrong sense,
and to inu^nt sundry different understandings of the words, to build upon it
many interpretations never heard of before, and for a final Conclusion to say,
the place is obscure, and therefore proves nothing. For Luc. 22. v. 19.
example hereof, those most evident words of Christ, This is my body with is
given for you, may suffice: for some of the^ wrest the pronowne hoc, others the
word est, others the word corpus, others the pronowne meum, others the relative
quod, others the preposition pro, others the pronowne vobis, and others the
Verb datur, and each word they wrest diverse ways, so as one, more then Anno
1577.
thirty years ago, has gathered out of their writings two hundred expositions
of these few words of Christ, of which Cl^u^ius de Xainctes numbreth
particulerly 84. And that they are both many, and different, yea repugnant,
wherewith they labor to make obscure these words of our Savior, no man can
doubt. See another example in the latin edition. And it is worthy of noting,
that in all these shifts they serve themselves of other places of Scripture, to
prove what they say: whereby it may appear how easy a thing it is, to corrupt
the Scripture by other places of Scripture, but that the prouide^t and daily
care of the holy Catholic 1. ad Tim. v. 15. Matt. 28.
Church opposes it self against such corruptions, worthily therefore called
the Pillar and Firmament of truth, against which the gates of hell shall never
prevail.

FINIS.
OF TRADITIONS. The second Part of the first Controversy.
CHAP. I. Of the true state of the Question.
HAVING already in the precedent Treatise spoken of the written Word of God,
and of all other things thereunto belonging; now it remains we speak a little
of the vnwritte^ word commonly called Traditions. But to the end that the state
of this controversy may more easily be understood, I will here set down four
things diligently to be considered in this matter we treat of. The first is,
that by the unwritten Word we only understand that which is not written in the
old o^ new Testament, for of the unwritten word of God in this sense is our
whole Controversy in this place. Wherefore that objection of our Adversaries is
both frivolous and nothing worth, to wit, that the word of God which we call the
unwritten word, may be found extant either among the holy Fathers, or in the
books of the Counsels, or other Canons of the Church. But this nothing
belongs unto this purpose: for it is sufficient for us, that this word of God
is not written in any book, either of the old or new Testament.

2. The second is that a thing may be contained in the holy Scripture 2. ways.
The one way is implicit, that is to say, in some general principle from
whence this other may be certainly deduced, and in this sense we acknowledge
that the whole word of God is contained in holy Writ, and not only in
Scripture, but also in the Apostles S. Aug. in 140. quaest. upon Exodus. Tom.
4. Matt. 22. v. 40.
C^eed, yea even in that one article, I believe the Catholic Church, so that
it be diligently examined and well understood, as S. Augustine very well
notes. For so, says Christ, the whole Law and Prophets do depend upon two
precepts of charity, as in the same place S. Augustine notes. For seeing that
the holy Scripture teaches that we are bound to believe the Church in all
things, and that it can neither deceive vsnor be deceived, as we will evidently
prove in the next Controversy in the 7. Chapter, it consequently also teaches
the whole and entire word of God, seeing that all that which is not express^d in
the holy Scripture, is contained expressy in the doctrine of the Church, the
which the Scripture commends unto us as infallible, as S. augustine very well
says, and declares S. Aug. Tom. 7. contra. Crescon. Gram. c. ^3. and de unit.
E^cles. c. 22. in fine-Matt. 17 - v. 5. Matt. 81. v. 17. Luc. 10. 16.
in many places. For even as God the Father comprehended in these few words (
This is my wellbeloued Son hear him) the whole word of God: so Christ
proposed unto us the whole word of God, when he commanded us to hear the
Church.

3. And in this sense do the holy Fathers often times say, that all the points
of faith are contained in the holy Scriptures, to wit, in that general
principle in the which they admonish us to b^lieue the Church: but many of the
holy Fathers sayings are falsified and corrupted by Martin Ke^ nitius, and some
Caluinists, as may be seen in Iudocus Ruesten in his first tome defending the
Council of Trent against Kemnitius,

4. Secondly a thing may be contained in express words in the holy Scriptures
as that Christ is borne, suffered, and risen again etc. And in this sense we
deny that the whole word of God is contained in the Scrip^u^e. That objection
of our Adversaries by this may easily be answered, when they say, that we
affirm, that Traditions are the v^written word of God, and yet we go about to
prove the^ by Scriptures. For we do not prove every particular Tradition by
express words of Scripture, but we only deduce and gather them out of it, and
convince in general, that there are Traditions.

5. The third thing which is to be considered, is, that our Adversaries being
convinced by truth, do acknowledge that many things were delivered unto us by
the Calvin. co^t. 4. sess. Con. Trident. in ^ntid. Beza denotis Eccles. tom 3.
Tract. Theo^. p. 137. edit. Anni 1582.
Apostles, besides those which are written. But, say they, those were only
external rites and ceremonies, serving only for the ornament or discipline of
the Church, but nothing concerning doctrine of faith was delivered by the
Apostles, which they have not set down in writing. So Calvin, and some others
which follow his opinion. Wherefore it remains for us to prove that not ^^ly
external ceremonies, but also those which belong unto the doctrine of faith
were delivered unto us by the Apostles, and that they were never expressly ^et
down in writing.

6. The fourth thing is, that seeing our Adversaries cannot deny that which was
objected unto them by Catholics, to wit, that the Scripture in many places
makes express mention of the word of God preached, delivered, and diuulged
over the whole world (as we have already declared even out of the holy
Scriptures) they are wont to answer, that long since in the Apostles time this
Word of God was delivered, preached, and not written, but the Apostles after
wards set down in writing all the preached word of God, or at the least as
much thereof as was necessary unto salvation. The which solutio^ albeit it be
very weak and frivolous, seeing that it relieth upon no sure ground, yet
notwithstanding that it may more fully be confuted we will declare hereafter,
that many of the chiefest points of faith were not expressly set down in
writing by the Apostles. And thus much of the state of this Question.

CHAP. II. Out of the first and chiefest principles of faith, it is clearly
convinced, that there are Traditions.
THE first argument whereby we prove Traditions, is taken out of some of the
chiefest principles of faith. For there are three chief and most necessary
points of faith, yea the c^ie^e grounds of our whole faith which are not to be
found expressly in Scripture.

2. The first, that there must needs be some Catalogue or Canon of the sacred
Books as well of the old as of the new Testament, the which all Christians with
an assured faith should embrace as a most certain and an undoubted truth, and
this is a very nec^ssary point of faith, yea of it depends the authority of
all the books of holy Scripture because by this Canon the sacred and true
books of Scripture are discerned, and made known from all those which be
Apocriphall; especially because as well in times past as in these our days
there has bin so many, and so great Controuersyes about the Canonical and
Apocriphall books of Scripture; and such a Canon was altogether necessary
as well in the ancient Church before Christ, as in our present Church after
Christ's time; the which also our Adversaries themselves have learned by
experience. For they have also placed their new Canon of the books of holy
Scripture in their Consession made at Confess. Ru^ellana. Act. 3.
^ochell, and in the later end of some of their Bibles, and yet neither in the
time of the old Testament, nor in the time of the new Law, was this Cano^ ever
written down in the Bibles themselves.

2. I know, our Adversaries, that they may escape this argument, do run to
the inward instinct of the holy Ghost, whereby say they, we know what book is
Canonical, and what is not. But this answer is refuted and rejected before,
where we have showed that the holy Ghost does not move us to believe any thing
with the Catholic faith, which is not the word of God. If Suprac. 5.
therefore the holy Ghost move us to believe that some books are Canonical,
and some are not, it is necessary that this be the word of God. We ask
therefore of them; whether this is the written word of God or the vnwritte^? if
it be the written word, in what Book or Chapter is it to befou^d, if it be no
where to be found, our Adversaries must needs co^^esse, that by the instinct of
the holy Ghost they also believe the unwritten word of God, or Traditions.

3. The second principle of faith is, that we must necessarily, with an assured
and firm faith believe, that all those Books either of the old, or of the new
Testament which we now retain, are safely delivered unto us entyre and
uncorrupted through so many hands, so many ages, so many vexations and
persecutions of the Christians, for otherwise the whole credit and authority of
those books will decay and perish. But this is no where extant or written, for
neither the Prophets or Apostles have eu^r written, that their books should
never be falsified or corrupted by any, yea it appears sufficiently Supra c.
9. 10. 12. and 13
by that which has been already said, that they were falsified and corrupted in
many books by the Jews and H^ret^kes. Let our Adversaries therefore tell us
where it is written, that this holy Scripture which we have now, is not
corrupted or falsified.

4. The third principle of f^yth is the true sense of the letter. For the true
word of God consists rather in the true sense or meaning of the words, then
in the words Supra cap. 3.
themselves, as we have declared before. But the true sense of the words, that
is to say, in what sense or meaning the words are to be understood, either
properly or figuratively, cannot be had from the holy Scripture alone, but also
from the doctrine and Traditions of the Church, as we have said before in the
fourth Chapter: whereby it also follows, that the written word of God
conteyneth in it the least part of the word of God, to wit, the bare letter
only: but the word of God preached and delivered keeps and professes unto us
the chief part of the word of God, that is to say, the true and native sense of
the same. S. Basil. l. de Spir. sanct. c. 27. Brent. contra Petr. ^ Soto in
suis prologom. Kemnit. cont. 4. sess. Conc. Trid. cum agi^ de 2. genesis Tradi^.


5. And this is that which S. Basil says, that those who reject the unwritten
points of faith, as indiscreet persons, do wrong and damnify the chief parts
of the Ghospel, yea they even as it were contract, or bring the whole preaching
of the Gospel, to the bare name thereof.

6. Many of our Adversaries who deal more sincerely with us, convinced by
these arguments, do acknowledge, that these grounds or principles of our faith
are only to be had by Traditions, without any written word of God, as Ioannes
Brentius, and Martin Kemnitius, who add also, that those Traditions which do
not repugne to the written word of God are to be admitted and received, and
that those only are to be rejected which are opposite unto the holy Scriptures.

7. But whatsoever our Adversaries do answer, it is altogether necessary that
they confess these three principles of our faith do belong indeed to the very
word of God it self. They must also needs confess these are not extant in
plain and express terms in any book either of the old or new Testament;
out of which necessarily follows, that the whole and entire word of God is
not contained expressly in the holy Scripture.

CHAP. III. Wherein it is proved out of other particular points of faith, that
there are Traditions.
THE second argument whereby we prove Apostolical Traditions, is taken out of
other particular points of faith, the which almost all our Adversaries believe
with us, albeit they be no where expressly contained in the Scriptures. There
are many points o^* says of this sort, whereof for example sake we will
allege some few. But to the end, we may use our accustomed* breuity, we will
rehearse only those which do also manifestly show out of this opinion of our
Adversaries (that nothing appertains to the doctrine of faith, which is not
expressly contained in holy Scripture) there are many grievous errors and
heresies in this our age arisen.

2. The first point is, that in God there are three Persons really distinct
among themselves, and one only substance, for this is now here extant in holy
Scripture, yea in it nothing is to be found expressly written either of the
substance or of the person in that signification wherein these words are used,
when we speak of the Blessed Trinity.

3. This indeed the Caluinists to their great loss and damage have
sufficiently learned by experience forty years ago in Transiluania. For when
one John Huniades whom they called John the second King of Hu^g^ry was then
Governor in Tra^^luania, a Country or Province of Hungary, had ordained a
public disputation betwixt the Cal^inists and the Anti-trinitarians, that is
to say those who oppugned the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, and that
according to the common doctrine on both syds, they should dispute only out of
the holy Scriptures, the Caluinists could never prove out of the Scriptures
alone, that there is either a substance or person in God, neither could they by
the Scriptures only, declare what is a person, or what is a substance.

4. Wherefore at the last this was the end of the disputation, that almost all
those which were present judged, that the Antitrinitarians got the victory, and
that the Caluinists were shamefully overcome: whereupon it came to pass, that
the said Prince of Transiluania, of a Caluinist became an Anti-trinitarian, yea
one of their chief friends; in so much that he took some public Churches from
the Caluinists, and gave them to the Anti-trinitarians, and he continued
miserably in that wicked heresy even till death, which happened in the year
1571. the 14. of March.

5. All which things are abounda^tly declared by one Ioannes Sommerus Pirnensis
in the funeral Oration which he made at his death, where in among other things
he affirms, that the chief cause why this Prince left the Caluinists, and
became an Antitrinitaria^, was this, because forsooth in the Scriptures he
could find nothing of the Blessed Trinity, and for that the Caluinists were
forced to confess, that the words whereby the mystery of the Blessed Trinity is
explicated are not exta^t in the holy Scripture: but because this funeral
Oration is scarce any where to be found, and least some should think that I
falsely coined these things my self, I will hear set down his own words.
For after he had most blaspemously spoken* as the Anti-trinitarians are wont to
do, against the Blessed Trinity, the which he calls here and there the
Roman Idolatry, these things he adds of his Prince.

6. This funeral Orat. of Joan Summer. was printedat Claudiopolian. Domini 1571.
But this our Prince (says he) being instructed by God, easily understood what
was the truth, and with earnest desire embraced it, and with no less pleasure
of mind defended it: for being accustomed even from his childhood to read the
holy Scriptures, he made them very familiar unto him, and presently he found
that such things which were contrary to the phrase of Christ and his Apostles,
were in the ensuing ages by a wicked curiosity brought into the Church; and
that they are not at all to be numbered amongst those things which add any
firmity or strength to the Author of our salvation, especially seeing that the
Adversaries themselves acknowledge, that the words whereby these subtilties of
this new opinion are explicated, if not rather (as I may well say) more
obscured, are not to be found in the writings of the Apostles.

7. And a little after. Wherefore little regarding either the multitude of
wranglers, He means Seruetus, who was bu^ned at Geneua an. 1553* as Beza
writes in vita Caluini.
or the torments and pains which others had endured, who first endeavored to
break this ice, he manifestly condemned the falsity of the Trinity, freely
professing his own opinion therein. And after a few words. For what has he
not done? what assemblies and disputations has he not ordained and caused to
be had about this matter, both in Hungary, and in Transiluania, that the sense
or meaning of the Scripture might the better be explicated, by conferring those
things together which were then said or spoken of, where he would not only be
present himself, but also taking the place or office of the Judge and vmpyre
in the said disputations, he very wisely and gravely confuted the great
absurdities of that superstition, warning often the Adversaries, that rejecting
the fancies or fond expositions of men, they should less impudently and more
sincerly carry themselves in the explication of the heavenly doctrine. Thus
far S^^^merus of the great care and diligence of the Prince of Transiluania
in defending the heresy of the Anti trinitarians.

8. Moreover it is also manifest, that out of this opinion of our Adversaries,
to Seruetus l. 1. de erroribus Trinitat. fol. 32. page 1. Edit. an. 1531.
wit, that we must not believe any thing which is not expressed in Scriptures,
this wicked heresy of the Anti trinitaria^s in these our days had her
beginning. For that Michael Seruetus who in our age was the first of them that
by printed books presumed to oppugn the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, does
plainly testify, writing in this manner. For the solution, says he, L. Item
apud.. A it Pr^tor. ff. d^ iniurijs.
of all things which may here be alleged by the Philosophers (for thus he
calls the Catholics) thou must observe this rule, which is an axiom among
Lawiers, that those things which do not deserve any special note or mark,
are understood and esteemed as things neglected, unless they be specially
noted. But I pray thee judge, whether this article of the Trinity deserve any
special note or no, seeing that it is the chiefest and first ground of all our
faith, whereof the whole knowledge of God and Christ depends. And whether it
be expressly noted or no, may be seen by reading over the Scriptures, seeing
that there is not one word to be found of the Trinity in the whole Bible, nor
of the persons thereof, nor of the essence or unity of the supposition, nor of
the unity of nature in many distinct things, and such like. Thus far
Seruetus. By this it evidently appears that all these monstrous and strange
opinions of latter Arians, who are also called Anti-trinitarians do proceed
from this one principle of our Adversaries, to wit, that we must only believe
Scriptures, and by this they are increased. But let us now see other matters.

9. The second point of faith is, that Infants are to be baptized. But our
Adversaries will never show this in the holy Joan. 3. v. 1.
Scriptures. For that one place which does clearly convince this, to wit,
unless he be borne again of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of God, they wrest and expound it in another sense. For they will
Calu. in cap. 5. Joan. v. 5.
not have this word ( water) to signify the element of water, but the holy
Ghost: so Calvin. Hence arose that wicked sect of the Anabaptists, who affirm
now adays, that it is an unlaw full and profane thing, to baptize Infants,
seeing that there is no solid reason hereof extant in the Scriptures.

10. For that whereunto Calvin, and his followers do fly for refuge, to wit,
that in the old Law Infants were circumcised, Genes. 17. v. 10.
the Anabaptists do easily confu^e both, because concerning that, there was an
express precept of God, but there was none of the baptism of Infants; and the
similitude also betwixt circumcision and baptism does not hold in all things,
for otherwise S. Aug: Tom. 6. de haer. cap. 84. S. Hier. co^tra Hell uid. Author
de Eccl. dogm. cap. 69. S. Ambros. in Epist. 7. ad Siriciu^ Papam. Epiph. haer.
78. lunius co^tra Bellar. Controu. 1. lib. 4. c. 9. nota 5.
women should not be baptized, but only men.

11. The third point of faith is, that the Blessed Virgin Mary the mother of
God remained always a Virgin, even after her childby^th. For this is extant
no where in Scripture, and yet Heluidius was condemned as an Heretic by the
whole ancient Church, because he presumed to deny it.

12. When Card. Bellarmine had alleged this un written point of faith, to
prove that all such points of faith were not expressly set down in holy Writ,
Francis^us Iunius to answer unto this difficulty was forced to take and
approve the condemned heresy of Heluidius. For he denies that we ought to
believe as a point of faith the perpetual Virginity of our B. Lady. But the
ancient Fathers had never condemned Heluidius a^ an Heretic, unless he had
denied a point of faith. But in this manner are our Adversaries forced to renew
the old heresies of times past, to the end they may defend this their paradoxe,
that we must only believe Scriptures.

CHAP. IIII. Whether there are any points of faith to be alleged, which are
no where extant in the Bible.
THE fourth Point that our Adversaries also believe, but without express
Scripture for it, is that Christians cannot lawfully Council. Trident. sess. 24.
c. 2.
have more wives at once: for the Council of Trent has very well defined this
to be a point of faith against the heresy of these times, whereof we will speak
more presently. But yet our Adversaries can never prove this out of Scripture
only, abstracting from the authority of the Church, albeit they also agree with
us in the belief heerof. Yea the examples of holy Scripture do rather persuade
the contrary. For those most holy men Abraham, Jacob, David, and many others
had more wives at once, yet never did God reprehend this in them, albeit he
often s^ake unto them. Beza Ep. 1. ad Andream Dudi^ium.


2. When Bernardine Ochi^e one of Caluins scholars did consider this, he was
not afraid to persuade both by word and writing, that Polygamy was yet lawful,
of whom, and of his most wicked life Beza writes at large.

^. But Ochinus grounded only this his heresy in that principle of our
Adversaries before alleged, to wit, that we must believe nothing which is not
expressly in Beza in lib de Poligamia. extat in i^it. voluminis 2. suarum Tract.
Theol.
Scripture. And whereupon Beza himself in his book which he wrote against the
same Ochinus does testyfy, that Ochinus used this argument: where Beza also
manifestly acknowledges, that Polygamy is not forbidden in holy Scripture by
any express Law. The other argumen^ says Beza) of Ochinus is, that Polygamy
is not forbidden by any express law to the contrary: but I answer, that there
are not laws written of all things. Thus Beza.

3. But after ward indeed Beza goes about to prove that Poligamy is contr^ry
to the Law of Nature, but the same difficulty still remains. For according to
our Adversaries doctrine all things necessary to salvation are expressed in
holy Scripture: but the observation of all things belonging to the Law of
Nature, is altogether necessary to salvation, therefore the observation of
these things is expressed in Scriptures, or else truly many things necessary
to salvation must be sought for out of the Scriptures. Moreover that Poligamy
is unlawful, is a point of faith: but this, as Beza confesses, is not
expressly contained in Scriptures, therefore all the points of faith are not
expressly contained in Scriptures.

4. The first point of faith is, that the Sacrament of Baptism may only be
given in water. For this point is also very necessary for the Church, least so
great and worthy a Sacrament be profaned, contrary to the institution of
Christ: and yet our adversaries will never be able to prove this out of the
Scriptures only, who deny that the forsaid place of S. John is to be understood
of true water, as we have said before in the second point. For the examples of
holy Scripture do prove indeed. 9. cap. praeced. Beza Epist. 2. ad Tho. Tilium
fratrem and Symmistam suum.
that water is the fit matter of Baptism, but they do not prove that there can
be no other matter.

5. When Beza did consider this well, least that his foresaid principle, that
we must believe nothing but Scripture, might seem to be called in question, he
was not a shamed to write, that Baptism might be given in any liquour, and by
this means it will be true and lawful Baptism, though it be given in milk,
wine, yea in Ink, or any other filthy liquour. Thus are our Adversaries forced
to admit these absurdityes, least they might be forced to depart from that
their principle of believing only Scripture.

6. Furthermore, to the end that Beza might more easily persuade the ignorant
common people to admit this his strange paradox, he adds presently a very
grievous slander against the Catholic Doctors. Let water be wanting, says
Beza, Beza ib. Epist. 2.
and yet the Baptism of any cannot be deferred with edification, nor must not
be; I truly would as well, and as lawfully baptize in any other liquour as in
water: neither are the most superstitious Deuines of any other opinion in these
matters. Thus far Beza. But these things which he writes are most false. For
there is no Catholic nor Scholasticall Doctor Council. Trid. sess. 7. car. 2.
de baptism^.
who has ever either thought or written so, yea the plain contrary is defined
by the Catholic Church, as a point of Faith.

7. The fixed point of faith, is, that bread and wine is only the necessary
matter of the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist. This point of faith is also
very necessary for the Church, least so great and so excellent a Sacrament
should be profaned; yet our Adversaries will never be able to prove it
effectually out of Scripture only. For by this word ( Bread) any kind of meat
is oftentimes signified in Scripture; of wine it is f^^re more doubtful. For
the Scripture makes only mention of the Chalice, and not of the liquor which
was in the Chalice; and Luc. 22. ^. 18. Call ibid. in sua harmonia. Beza Ep. 2.
cit.
Calvin himself acknowledges, that these words ( of the fruit of the vine)
were spoken before the institution of this Sacrament.

8. The which when Beza easily preceaued, here also be went about to bring in
another error, least indeed he should be fored to forsake his former principle
of believing only Scripture. For he was not afraid to write that he erred
nothing from the institution of Christ, who in the consecration of the
Euch^rist should use instead of the bread appointed for that purpose, any other
usual meat, and instead of the wine any other ordinary kind of drink, and by
this means one may consecrate the Eucharist either in cheese, flesh, fish, or
eggs, as also in milk, water, beer or vinager, or any other liquor, which
hitherto was never heard of in Gods Church. And yet for all this Beza is not
ashamed to attribute this most absurd error of his to all the Scholasticall
Doctors. For of both these errors he treats in the words before alleged,
because when he says the Scholasticall Doctors were of no other opinion, he
speaks as well concerning the matter of the Eucharist, as of the matter of
Baptism. After this manner our Adversaries do force so many and so great
errors out of that their principle of believing only Scriptures, whereof more
might be alleged, which for breuities sake we omit.

9. But there is one thing I cannot let pass, because thereby we clearly
convince that the Traditions of the Church do not only contain un written
points of faith, but (that which is more) even in our Adversaries judgment,
they change and abolish such things as are expressly commanded in Scriptures:
for even in the Table of the Law of God, which is said to be written by Gods
own hand, in many and manifest words the keeping of Exodus ^4. v. 1. Exodus 20.
v. 8, 9. 10. 11.
the Sabbath day is commanded, the which notwithstanding, now all, except a few
Anabaptists, do confess to be abrogated by Ecclesiastical Traditions only,
without any express testimony of Scripture. The Anabaptists I say, being also
deceived by that common principle of our Adversaries of believing only
Scriptures, they go about to bring the observation of the Sabbath day into v^e
and custom again, and for this Vi^e Prateolum V. Sabatharij.
cause they are called Sabatharians: but not so much the Heresy as the madness
of these men is condemned of all, and namely of Luther in his book against the
Sabbatharians, in the seventh Tome.

CHAP. V. Wherein it is proved, that there are Traditions by the testimonies of
the holy Fathers.
THE third argument whereby we prove, that all the points of our faith are not
set down in writing by the Apostles, is the authority Co^cius Tom. 1. l. ^.
Artic. v^timo. Bellarm. Tom. 1. l. 4^. de verbo Dei c. 7.
of the aunc^e^t Fathers, who affirm and teach this in many places. The which
places of the holy Fathers, as well the Greeks, as the Latins, ^odocus Co^cius
has very diligently gathered together in his book int^tuled Thes^urus
Catholicus, and before him Bellarmine did the same. But least we be longer then
the order of Epitomes does permit, especially in a thing so manifest, it shall
suffice us to alledg one chief Doctor of the Greek, and another of the Latin
Church.

2. Among the Grecians S. Chrysostom is the most famous, who does not only
affirm it, but also manifestly proves it out of holy Scripture. For when he
expounds those words of the later Epistle 2. These. ^. 2. v. 14.
to the Thessalonians: Therefore brethren stand, and hold the Traditions which
you have learned, whether it be by word, or by our Epistle, he writes thus:
Hence it appears, says S. Chrysostom, that he did not deli^^r all things
unto them by his Epistle, but many things also without his letters: but as well
these, as those other worthily deserve S. Chrysostom. Hom. 4. in 2. ad These.
to be believed; therefore ^e esteem the Tradition also of the Church to be
worthy o^ credit. It is a Tradition* seek no further. Thus S. Chrysostom. But
it is most certain that the Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 14. sect. vlt. S. Aug. Tom.
7. de ba^t. contra Donat. l. 2. cap 7.
Apostle, and consequently S. Chrysostom also who expounds him, does not
only speak of ceremonies and customs, but also of points of Faith.

3. S. Augustine whom Cal^in acknowledges to be the best, and most ^aythfull
witness of antiquity, writes in this manner. Many things are not to be sound
in the Apostles writings, nor in the ensewing Counsels, and yet
notwithstanding because they are generally kept through out the whole Catholic
Church, they are iuged to have been delivered and commended by none* but by
them. Thus S. Augustine. Neither can it be said, that S. Augustine speaks of
ceremonies and not of points of faith. For in that place he proves against the
Donatists that those which were baptized in the accustomed form and matter by
heretics were not to be baptized again: but none unless he be an Anabaptist,
will deny that this is a point of faith.

CHAP. VI. Wherein even by the doctrine of our Adversaries it is proved, that
there are Traditions.
THE fourth argument whereby we prove Traditions, is taken out of the doctrine
of our Adversaries. For all those things which our Adversaries do affirm to be
points of faith against the Catholic doctrine, they teach and believe them
without any express Scripture. For it cannot be found expressly in Scripture,
that faith only iustifyeth, that there are only two Sacraments of the new law,
that none should pray for the de^d etc. for all these things and many others
which they teach against us, they gather only out of Scriptures, and that by
some false and very weak consequence; but it is no where expressly written,
that faith only justifies, that there are only two Sacraments, that we must
not pray to Saints or for the dead etc.

2. Moreover there can no Catholic be found who does not receive and assuredly
believe the whole authentical text of the holy Scripture: why do they therefore
condemn us, when they affirm that nothing is to be believed besi^^ the text
of Scripture, whereas the whole Controversy betwixt them and us, is of the
unwritten points of faith, which we affirm, and they deny?

3. Our Adversaries being convinced by this argument, do now at the last
confess, that not only that is to be admitted and believed as the pure word of
God Beza de n^^i^ Ec. page 137. volu^. 2. Theol. Tract. ^dit. an. 1581.
which is expressly written in holy Scripture, but all that also which by a
necessary consequence may be gathered out of it.

4. But when they answer thus, they are forced to depart and forsake that
their first principle, when by they affirm^d that all the points of faith are
expressly contained in Scriptures, and that they were set down in writing by
the Apostles.

5. Furthermore not per^auing so much, they join in opinion with us, so that
they must needs indeed confess that the Traditions of the Church are
altogether necessary. For such things as are gathered out of Scriptures do
rather belong to Traditions then to express Scripture. For that which only,
consequently, and by reasoning and discoursing is gathered out of Scripture
albeit it very well, and necessarily may be deduced from thence, is not
expressly in Scripture, but only obs^urly, secretly, or vertually is contained
therein. For no man can truly say, that the conclusion which is only inferred
out of the premises is expressly contained in the same premises, for otherwise
our discourse and arguing were vain, and to no purpose. But therefore do we
reason and discourse, to the end, that, that which lies hidden vertually in
the premises, may be expressly manifested in the conclusion.

6. And that we may allege an example out of the Scriptures themselves, when
God the Father said, this is my well-beloved Matt. 17. v. 5.
Son, hear him: Out of these words we may very well gather, and by a
necessary consequence, that the whole doctrine of Christ our Lord is to be
heard and received of all: yet none will say, that all the doctrine of Christ is
contained expressly in these few words. And truly the holy Scripture is so
fertile and plentiful, that many points of faith do as yet lie hidden and
unknown therein, which hitherto have never been gathered together by any, but
these things are contained vertually, and not expressly in it.

7. Moreover, after so many debates and contentions, after so many books set
forth against us, after so many slanders whereby our Adversaries charge us, as
though we taught that the Scriptures are imperfect, they at the last return to
our opinion. For we do not deny, yea we willingly acknowledge, that all those
things which rightly and without error are deduced or gathered out of the
express words of the holy Scriptures, do belong unto the written word of God,
and are contained in holy writ obscurely not expressly, vertually and not
plainly. For in that God does reveal any thing in express words*
consequently and vertually he reuealeth all things which necessarily and
without any error may be deduced from thence.

8. We grant also that the Scripture consequently, mediatly, and vertually, as
in a general principle conteyneth all things necessary to salvation, yea in
that one only article of the Creed, I believe the holy Catholic Church; in
those few words also of Christ, Luc. 19. v. 16.
he who hears you, hears me, if the collection be rightly framed, as we
have also said before in the 25, Chapter. But when these things are gathered
together which are not expressly in Scripture, there is scarce any of them
which is not uncertain and doubtful without the authority and Traditions of
the Church. Wherefore these collections do manifestly convince the necessity
and authority of Traditions.

9. But that these collections may be vncert^yne and deceytfull, both
experience and reason teaches us: experience, because almost all Heresies have
had their beg^nning not from the Scripture alone in it self, but from these
collections badly framed and made. For there is not almost any one heresy which
is only grounded on the express words of Scripture without some other
collection, seeing that almost all Heretics both in times past as now al^o, go
about to prove and gather their heresies from the Scripture, by certain
deceytfull and sophistical arguments. Arius for example, out of those words of
Christ, the Father is greater then I, did gather Joan. 14. v. 28.
but badly, that Christ even according to his divine Nature was inferior to
his Father. The new Arians out of those words of the ten co^mau^deme^ts, thou
shall not have strange Gods before me, do gather but foolishly, that Exodus 20.
v. 3.
the Son is not God, the holy Ghost is not God. So the Devil himself against
Christ Matt. 4. v. 6.
used this reason, It is written, God has given his Angels charg^ of thee,
therefore cast thy self down headlong. Lastly all the arguments indeed which
our Adversaries at this time allege against us out of Scriptures, and all the
errors which they have inverted, do take their beginning and strength from
their new illations and reasons, and not out of the bare and plain words of
Scripture, as will manifestly appear in every one of these Controversies.

10. The reason also is manifest why these their collections and reasons are
uncertain and doubtful. For in nothing can one more easily, or more often
err, then in these illations. The which may proceed of many causes; either
because the illation it self is bad and Sophistical, or because the place of
Scripture from whence it is gathered, is falsified by some false exposition
thereof, or because the proposition which is assumed and adjoined to the words
of Scripture is false and ambiguous, or because one or more words in that
collection are used doubtfully, that is to say, in one sense in the premises,
and in another in the conclusion; or lastly because there happens some error
to be in the collection which makes it weak, Sophistical, and erroneous.

11. Besides that, there are so many and so contrary illations of diverse men,
that the authority of the Church is altogether necessary in matters of faith,
that there may arise a certain and an undoubted faith of these matters, of
which sort Traditions are, that is to say, the doctrine of the whole Church.

12. But when one belieueth such an illation with a divine or Catholic faith,
he must needs know two things, the one is, that the express place of
Scripture from whence this conclusion is deduced, must certainly be well
understood by him which disputes: the other is, that he who makes such a
deduction and collection, can neither deceive others, nor be deceived himself.
But none can know either of these, without the Traditions of the Church, seeing
that otherwise there is none which may not be deceived sometimes. All
collections therefore which produce or breed faith in us, do most clearly
convince, and show the authority and necessity of Traditions.

CHAP. VII. Wherein it is proved, that there are Traditions, by the absurdities
which otherwise would follow.
THE fifth argument whereby we prove, that many things are to be believed which
are not expressed in holy Scriptures, is taken out of the absurdities which do
ensue of the contrary doctrine. For having once admitted, that nothing is to be
believed which is not expressed in Scripture, all old heresies are renewed, and
a great uncertainty and confusion of all things is brought into the Church of
God, yea even the way to Atheism is laid open, because having once rejected
and despised the Traditions of the Church, all the points of faith from the
Apostles time till now, explicated and proved by the ancient Fathers against
heretics, all those things also which were decreed and determined by all the
general Counc^lls in times past against the said heretics, loose their
chief^st strength and authority; the which notwithstanding our Adversaries do
acknowledge themselves to receive and believe.

2. Neither do we know by an assured Catholic faith, whether there were ever
any Fathers or Counsels* but by the Traditions of the Church. But neither do
we know any other way but by faith, whether since the Apostles time till now
there were any Catholics or no^: because of those things which were done since
the time and death of the Apostles, there is nothing extant in holy Scripture,
seeing that all the books thereof were written before the death of the
Apostles. But such things as have b^n done since till now, cannot otherwise be
known but by the Tradition of the Church.

3. Neither is it sufficient to say, that we know these things by the
Ecclesiastical histories. For that faith which proceeds of histories,
without the authority or Traditions of the Catholic Church, is but an humane
faith, which oftentimes deceaueth others, and may be deceived it self, and
therefore these kind of histories cannot produce a divine faith in us: this
experience it self does clearly teach us. For our Adversaries do somtymes
doubt whether S. Peter was ever at Rome, or no, because forsooth this is not to
be found expressly in holy Scripture, whereas notwithstanding it is most
assuredly proved and testified in many books both of the ancient
Historiographers and holy Fathers: Why may they not as lawfully call other
matters in question, which are notwithstanding expressly set down in other
ancient writers? Our Adversaries therefore do make all things very doubtful
and uncertain, whiles they will only believe and admit the Scripture: but now
let us answer their arguments.

CHAP. VIII. Wherein the arguments of our Adversaries, taken out of the old
Testament, are confuted.
THE first argument whereby our Adversaries oppugn Traditions, and which they
use very often, the which also as invincible they have added to the confession
of their Rupell. Confess. Art. 5. Deuteronomy. 4. v. 2. Deuteronomy. 12. v. vlt.
faith, they take out of these words of Deuteronomy, Thou shall not add any
thing to the word which I speak unto you; nor shall you take any thing from
it. And again, that which I command thee do that only; neither add or
diminish any thing from it. By these places of Scriptures our Adversaries do
infer, that nothing is to be received as a point of faith, which is not
expressly set down in Scripture.

2. But this argument is erroneous, and the weakness thereof is very great for
many causes. First because in those words there is no mention made of the
Scripture, nor of the written word of God, but only of the word preached and
delivered viua voce. Thou shall not add (says the Scripture) to the word that
I speak unto you, he does not say, that I write unto you. Again, Do only
says he, that which I command thee, he does not say, that which I write unto
thee.

3. Moreover in these words the holy Scripture does not only speak of matters
of faith to be believed, but also of ceremonies and customs to be done and
observed: but our Adversaries themselves confess, that these customs may be
added by the authority of the Church, yea they have ordained themselves very
many, the which they chang even yet when they please. Calvin also acknowledges
that Calu. co^tra 4 sess. Council. Trident.
many unwritten customs were delivered unto us by the Apostles.

4. That also according to the phrase of Scripture is said to be added to the
word of God which is contrary and opposite unit. For Iosue did not transgress
this commandment of Deuteronomy, when he added his book to the books of
Moses. Nor did others transgress it, who added the books of the Judges,
Ruth, and of the Kings, which were not written by Moses, and which are also
to be believed as containing points of faith. But in these books there is
nothing contrary to that which Moses wrote. And the Hebrew text agrees very
well to this answer, for in both places of Deuter^nomy this word ( Ghal) is
used, which sig^^tieth o^tentines contrary, or against, so that the sense is,
Do not add any thing contrary to the word which I command: and again, ye
shall not add any thing contrary to the word which I say unto you. For so is
that particie ( G^^l) taken in the 40. Psalm (or according to the Hebrews
41.) in the 2. Psalm also, the second verse And in the 14. of Numbers the 2.
verse, and else where very often. Even as also in the new Testament (...), which
answers to the Hebrew Ghal, signifies also contrary, or ag^i^st; when the
Apostle writes to the 1. ad Cor. 4. v. 6.
Corinthians, that in us you may learn, one not to be puffed up against
another above that is written, that is to say, against the Scripture, the which
says, we must not be puffed up in pride, ^s S. Chrysostom, and after him
Theophilactus and others do note upon that place. The which place some bouldly
allege against Traditions: whereas the Apostle in that place does not speak of
the whole Calu in ^lla verba 1. ^l Cor. 4. v. 6.
word of God, but of this one point, that we must not be puffed up in pride, as
even Calvin himself acknowledges.

5. But to omit all such things as other Catholic Doctors have very well, and
learnedly written of the proper and literal sense of these words, yea that we
may also grant to our Adversaries, that this which they allege is the true
sense, they err very much in that they think that these words of Moses
belong unto us* and that we are no l^sle now bound and obliged by them, then
the Ieues were in times past. For these words do no more appertain unto us
then those of the same book of Deuteronomy. C^rsed be ^e that Devt 27. v. v^^.
abides not in the words of this Law, and s^lfil^^th them not in work. From
which words S. Paul manifestly teaches that we are delivered Ad Gal. 3. l.
10. and 1^.
and freed, by the grace of Christ Jesus. But seeing that in these words which
they do here allege, Moses commands that the Children of Israel should
observe and fulfill every word which he had commanded them, for so it is
expressly set down Deuteronomy 12. the last verse, in the Hebrew text, and in
all the Bib^s of our Adversaries, and he presently adds, that nothing is to
be added or detracted from all these, he manifestly commands the keeping of
the whole Moysaicall Law, and of all the Sacraments, Sacrifices, and Ceremonies
of the old Testament. For he does not only command, that nothing should be
added, but also that nothing is to be detracted of all those things by him
commanded. Wherefore if our Adversaries object against us that we add any
thing against this precept, we may more justly object unto then, that they
detract far more then we add, seeing that they neither observe the
Circumcision, nor the legal Sacrifices, nor other Ceremonies which are so
often and so straitely commanded in Deuteronomy. It cannot truly be denied,
but that this is to detract somewhat from those things which Moses
commanded; and ther^ore our Adversaries must needs confess that these are
the words of the old Law, and consequently do appertain nothing unto us. Out
of this which has been said, it follows, that our Adversaries do very
indiscretly and foolishly boast and brag of those words of Moses. For in
the exposition thereof they err far from the truth, and a great deal more
in the application, when they go about to prove that we are also bound and
obliged by them.

6. Our Adversaries take their second argument out of these words of Salomo^s
Proverb. 30. v. 5. and 6.
prouerb^: Every word of God is fiery* it is a s^ield of defense to those which
hope in it: do not add any thing to the words thereof* and thou shall not be
found and reprehended as a liar. I answer that this place makes nothing
against us: for in that place there is no mention made of Scripture only, but
of all the word of God. And it is most true that nothing should be added to all
the whole word of God, the which is to be believed with a Catholic faith as
the true word of God. For as we have said before, our faith relyeth only on the
word of God, but the Scripture only is not all the word of God, because all
Traditions also which contain points of faith belong thereunto, as we have
sufficiently Supra c. 2.
proved already. But they add to the word of God, and are lyar^ who affirm
that God said this, or that, which indeed he never spoke. And of this sort ^re
those false Prophets, of whom God by the Prophet Jeremy complayneth, saying:
They Hier. 23. v. 16. and 21.
speak the vision of their hearts, not from the mouth of our Lord: and again,
I did not speak, unto them and they did prophesy. This place also may very
well be understood, of those who add any thing contrary to the word of God. For
in the Hebrew text* there is set down that particle ( Ghal) which often tyme^
signifies contrary, or against, as we have already declared in our answer to
the first argument.

CHAP. IX. Wherein is examined that place of S. Paul's Epistle to the Galath^ans,
which our Adversaries do object against Traditions.
THE third argument our Adversaries take out of the first Confess. Rup^l^. Art.
3.
Chapter to the Galathians, the which they have also added to their confession
of faith as invincible. For they have omitted their second argument as not
strong enough for their purpose. But thus they frame their argument: The
Apostle Gal. 1. v. 8. and 9.
says twice an Anathema to those, who teach any thing besid^ that which he
has taught: therefore nothing is to be received or believed but Scripture. Our
Adversaries have this place of the Apostle often in their mouths, wherefore it
shall be exa^ined more exactly. We answer therefore tha^ our Adversaries do err
here for two reasons: first because our whole controversy is of the written
word of God: but in these words there is no mention made of the written word,
or of Scripture, but only of the word preached and delivered vi^^ v^c^ to the
Galathians by S. Paul. And hence it is that S. Augustine far otherwise
August. Tom. 7. de unit. Ec^les. c. 24.
then our Adversaries, disputing against the Donatists, proves by these words
of the Apostle, that we are bound to admit and belieu^ the Traditions of the
Church: as for example, that those who are once orderly and lawfully christened
by Heretics, are not to be baptized again. And well truly; for that which is
viua voce delivered, is a Tradition, and not Scpriture. Moreover if the
Scripture only contained expressly all the points of faith, the Apostle would
rather have proposed the Scripture as the rule of faith, then his own
preaching, seeing that the Scripture is manifestly well known to all Nations,
but his own preaching to the Galathians only. But our Adversaries urge again
and say, that all that which the Apostle preached to the Galathians was
written, either before that time or afterward by S. Paul and the other
Apostles: they say this, but they prove it not. For this is no where written in
holy Scripture, and so whiles they go about to persuade us, that all points of
faith are written, they coin and invent a new poyn^, which is no where extant
in Scripture, that is to say, that all such things as S Paul viua voce taught
the Galathians, are written. But we following herein S. Augustine, do 3. Aug.
Tom. 9. Tract. 96. in Io. and Tom 7. de ^nit. Eccles. c. 21. infine.
gather much better by these words, and infer thus against them. If there must
be nothing believed, but that which S. Paul preached to the Galathians, and
that none knows certainly what are those things which he preached, but by the
Traditions and doctrine of the Church, it follows manifestly, that besides the
Scripture we must also believe the Traditions and doctrine of the Church; seeing
that without them we cannot certainly and without error know what were those
things which the Apostle taught the Galathians.

2. Secondly our Adversaries do err in that they do not rightly expound that
particle in the words of S. Paul, (praeter) (besides) but rather contrary to
the Apostles meaning. For the Latin word praeter, as also the Greek word
(...), and the Hebrew ( Ghal) have two significations. In the former it
signifies all that which is not the self same thing whereof we do speak: in
the later sense it signifies that only which is contrary to that we speak of.
In which sense praeter signifies the same that contra does, to wit ( against:)
the former sense is manifest enough, the later is proved by these places of
Scripture, Act. 18. v 13. where all do translate these Greek words, Calu in
act. Apo^ an. 1560. Beza ed. an. 1560. and 1565. and 1598. Hemic. Steph. in
these. linguae Graecae Tom. 2. dictione (...).
(...), to be against the Law: so has not only the vulgar edition, but also
Calvin and Beza, and all the French Bibles of Geneua. Likewise in the first to
the Romans the 26. verse. (...) signyfieth against Nature: so has the vulgar
edition and all the French Bibles of Geneua, yea Cicero, as witnesses Henricus
Stephanus does thus translate this phrase out of Greek. Again in the 4. to
the Romans the 18. verse, (...) signifies against, as the vulgar edition, and
Beza has in all editions. Moreover in the 11. to the Romans the 24. verse.
(...) signifies against, as the vulgar edition and all the Bibles of Geneua
have: finally in the last to the Romans the 17. verse. as well the Greek word
(...), as the Latin word ( praeter) in our interpreter signifies the same
thing that contra does, as manifestly appears by the precedent words, for
dissentions and scandals are contrary or against the doctrine of Christ, and
not only besides his doctrine. Wherefore Calvin in his Commentaries set forth in
the year 1557. upon the Epistle to the Romans, and Sebastian Castalio, and
all the French Bibles of Geneua, have contrary or against the doctrine: and
albeit Beza translateth it besid^ the doctrine, yet in his last edition set
forth in the year 1598. he translateth it, contrary to the doctrine; and in
his Annotations he warns that it is rather so to be translated. It is not
therefore strange or absurd that the Greek word (...), or the Latyne praeter,
should fignify the same that contra does.

3. But now that this word may not only be thus used, but that also it must
necessarily be so understood and taken in this place, we have showed by the
absurdities which would otherwise follow. The first is, that S. Paul would have
said Anathema to S. John Evangelist, who many years after the preaching of S.
Paul to the Galathians, yea after his death, wrote his Apocalypse, wherein there
are many new revelations which S. Paul had not preached to the Galatha^s,
because they were not the^ revealed by God.

4. The second absurdity: that S. Paul had pronounced Anathema upon all those
who in his time by a prophetical spirit 1. Cor 14. v. 2. 4. 16. and 30.
did daily prophesy new things. For in the Apostles times there were many such,
as appears by the first epistle to the Corinthians. And S. Paul could not
preach to the Galathians that which God had not yet revealed.

5. The third absurdity: the Apostle for the same reason had pronounced
Anathema against S. Luke, who in the Acts of the Apostles, relates many
things which happened long after S. Paul left Galatia.

6. The fourth absurdity: the Apostle for the same cause also had condemned
himself with the said A^athema. For he wrote many Epistles after he had left
Galatia, wherein he reateth many things which happened afterward unto him,
either at Rome, or in other places.

7. Lastly it is an absurd thing to think either God, after those words of S.
Paul to the Galathians, could reveal to men nothing more by an Angel sent
from heaven, or that the said Angel who by the commandment of God should
reveal any new thing but not contrary to faith, should incur that Anathema
by S. Paul, seeing that this were to wrest the Anathema upon God himself, who
commanded the Angel to do so. This place therefore cannot be understood of
diverse and distinct things from those which S. Paul taught the Galathians, but
only of contrary and opposite things unto them. But according to this sense of
the word ( praeter) all the foresaid Absurdities do cease. For neither S. John
in his Apocalypse, nor S. Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, nor any other which
did prophesy, nor S. Paul himself, ever wrote or taught any thing contrary to
that which S. Paul taught the Galathians. But even God himself cannot Ad Heb.
16. v. ^8.
reveal the contrary by an Angel, because according to the Apostle, It is
impossible for God to lie.

8. Neither is it sufficient for me to say, that those things which were
afterward revealed and written, were not necessary points of faith to
salvation. For S. Paul did not say, if any shall Euangelize unto you any point
necessary to salvation: but absolutely, if any shall Euangelize any thing
contrary to that which you have received. Moreover, all those things which
were afterward set down in holy Scripture were true points of faith, the which
every Christian is necessarily bound to believe, if not expressly, yet at the
least virtually and generally every one is bound to believe, if not expressly,
yet at the least virtually and generally every one is bound to believe with an
assured faith all those things which are in holy Writ to be most certain and
true.

9. Finally, even our Adversaries confession does convince this to be most
true, for now they acknowledge that all those things which by a necessary
conseqe^ce are deduced out of the Scriptures do belong unto the word of God,
and are points of says, and therefore they may be lawfully preached unto the
people, as we have Suprac. 3.
said before. But al these are distinct things from those which are expressly
written in holy Scripture. For the antecedent whereby some other thing may be
inferred, is distinct from that which is inferred. For it were a ridiculous
illation, if one and the same thing should be inferred from it self. But that
which is inferred in a good collection is never contrary to the antecedent. The
Apostle therefore speaks of doctrine contrary to his, and not absolutely of
any other distinct doctrine.

10. And in this sense the Fathers do often say, that S. Paul affirmed in this
place that nothing was to be taught besides that August. Tom 7. contra lit.
Petil. Donat. l. 3. cap. 6. August. Tom. 9. Tract. 98. in Euan. loan. subfinem.
which is in the holy Scripture. For so S. Augustine speaks in one place. But
in another he clearly explicateth himself by this word ( praeter) to
understand ( contra) because we must preach nothing contrary to the holy
Scripture. That this is the true sense and meaning of S. Augustine, it is
manifest by the words themselves, whereby also he proves that the word (
praeter) in those words of the Apostle, does signify diverse, but not contrary
things. For in this manner he writes, when he warns his scholars to take
heed of the opinions of the Manichaeans and other heretics, Ad Gal. 1. v. 6.
because these are not only distinct, but also contrary to those which the
Apostle taught. Let the admonition, says he, of the holy Apostle never depart
from your heart: If any shall euangelize unto you besides that which you have
received, let him be Anathema. He does not say, 1 Thessalonians. 3. v. 10.
more then you have received, but, besides that which you have received. For if
he should say that, he should be prejudicial to himself, who coueteth to come
to the Thessalonians, that he might supply that which was wanting to their
says. Now he which supplieth, adds that which is lacking, takes not away
that which was. But he which ouerposseth Joan. 16. v. 11.
the rule of faith, does not go on in the way, but departs from the way.
That therefore which our Lord says, I have yet many things to say unto you, but
you cannot bear them now, were to be added to those things which they knew,
and not to be overthrown by those they had already learned Hitherto S.
Augustine.

CHAP. X. Wherein^other objections of our Adversaries against Traditions are
refuted.
THE fourth argument is deduced out of these words of the Apocalypse, Apoc. 22.
v. 18. Confess. Rupell. Artic. 5.
which they also cite and allege in their Confession at Rochell. If any man
shall add to these things, God shall add upon him the plagues written in this
book. But who does not see that S. John speaks expressly of the book of the
Apocalypse only, and not of the whole Scripture, for he says, I testify to
every one hearing the words of the Prophesy of this book, if any man shall
add to these things etc. and in the 19. verse following, If any man shall
diminish of the words of the book of this prophesy etc. He speaks therefore
only of the prophetical words of the Apocalypse. For it is manifest otherwise
out of Ecclesiastical histories, that S. John wrote his Gospel after the
Apocalypse, and Hier. de script. Eccles. in Joan. Apost.
consequently that he added many things besides the Apocalypse. But let our
Adversaries take heed least they incur those pains which S. John threatens
to those which add or detract any thing from the Apocalypse; seeing that they so
often and so bouldly wrest the prophesies of the Apocalypse to many strange
senses against the Pope, and the Catholic Church.

2. Our Adversaries allege many other things, but their arguments which be of
less moment are taken out of those places of Scripture which commend unto us
the great excellency of holy Scripture. But Supra c. 2.
all these are very easily confuted by that one ground, which as we have
declared before even our Adversaries do admit, to wit, that to the end the holy
Scripture be perfect in it self, and sufficient to everlasting salvation, it
is not necessary that it should expressly co^teyne al points of faith, but it is
sufficient, that all such points may be deduced by a good consequence out of
it. But all the Traditions of the Church which belong unto faith may be
gathered, Supra c. 2.
as we have said, out of Scripture, the which also we declare more at large in
every one of these controversies. Our Adversaries therefore have not reason to
say that we teach the Scripture to be impersect or insufficient. For as
concerning this sufficiency and perfection of Scripture they are forced at
least to yield and subscribe unto our opinion here in: but these their
arguments, whereof they make great account, we have therefore alleged, to the
end all may know how badly they interpret the holy Scriptures, and by how
friuolus reasons they are persuaded to forsake the Catholic faith.

3. But even this sufficiency of Scripture which they pretend, they prove very
foolishly by those words of the Apostle, wherein he teaches, that the
Scripture Ad Tim. 3. v. penut!.
is very profitable; as though forsooth, every thing which is profitable for
obtaining some particular end or purpose, were also absolutely sufficient; then
the which nothing can be spoken more absurdly. The Head truly is not only
profitable, but also necessary, that a man may live: but who I pray you, will
say that the head only without the rest of the body is sufficient for the life
of man. But our late Adversaries, to the end they may make this their discourse
or reason the stronger, say, that in humane things not every thing which is
profitable is also sufficient, but in divine matters whatsoever Iunius co^tra
Bell. controu. 1. lib. 4. c. 10. not^ 44.
is profitable, is also sufficient, whereunto Iunius like a fine young stripling
adds, that this can be overthrown by no sophistry. But who does not see,
that the Eucharist by the divine virtue thereof is profitable to the obtaining
of eternal salvation, and yet notwithstanding without Baptism it is not
sufficient, as also without faith and penance: the same may be said of
Baptism, and of every book of Scripture. Yea even the Apostle does not speak
of the whole Scripture, as our Adversaries think he does, when he says, that
every Scripture is profitable, but of every particular part thereof. For how
Hier. de Scrip. Eccles. in ^oa^ Apost. 2. Tim. 1. v. penult.
could he speak of a thing which was not then extant: But as then the Gospel
of S. John was not yet written, nor the Apocalypse: For these were after S.
Paul's death written by S. John. Hence it is, that the Apostle S. Paul does not
say, the whole Scripture, but even Scripture inspired by God, is profitable.
For there is not one part of Scripture which is not profitable unto us, if it
be well vnsterstood: Yet for all that notwithstanding every one part precisely
in it self abstracting from the rest of the Scripture (as all do very well
know) is not sufficient.

4. Finally it is also to be considered, that all those places wherein the
integrity, perfection and vtility of the Scripture is commended unto us, must
needs be understood not of the bare words only, but of the same well and
rightly understood. But this true understanding of the words cannot otherwise
be had then by Tradition, Supra c. 4.
and the unwritten doctrine of the Church it self, as we have already
decl^red. Wherefore all those places which do commend unto us the holy
Scriptures, do also consequently commend unto us Traditions and the unwritten
Word of God, seeing that therein consists the principal part of holy
Scripture, to wit, the true sense of the words.

CHAP. XI. Wherein is declared, how we may know the Apostolical Traditions.
AMONG the other arguments of our Adversaries this is one, that we cannot know
certainly which are the Traditions of the Apostles, seeing that many Heretics
in times past pretended also that their heresies were agreing to Apostolical
Traditions. Moreover they object, that Traditions may easily be corrupted and
changed, and for this cause Scripture was ordained, that the doctrine delivered
by word of mouth might continue the longer without any falsification or
corruption. But we answer to this their reason: that the ancient Heretics
also by supposed and false Scriptures which they attributed falsely to the
Apostles, did confirm and prove their heresies. Aug. de ciu. Dei l. 15 and 23.
subfinem.
Many things, says S. Augustine, were alleged by heretics, as though they
were the sayings of the Prophets and Apostles. But yet for all that, they were
not judged to be the most certain and Canonical Scriptures.

2. But the Traditions of the Apostles may so certainly and easily be known
from supposed and false Traditions, as the Canonical Scriptures may be known
from the Apocriphall: for they are both known by the same means and
authority, that is to say, by the authority, doctrine, and testimony of the
Catholic Church, which neither can deceive any, nor be decevued her self.

3. And albeit, speaking of humane matters the Scripture is more certain the^
Tradition alone, yet it happens otherwise in matters concerning God, because
in these there is the authority of God, and the continual assistance of the
Holy Ghost has place, which does not suffer the Church to err: and hence it
is, that the Tradition only of the Church which is not so much written in
paper, as printed 1. ad Cor. 5. v. 3. 4.
in the hearts of Christians, is a most certain, and faithful keeper of all
the points of our divine faith.

4. Moreover, if even Christ himself had with his own hand written in brass
all the points of our faith, they should notwithstanding not have had so great
certainty* as now Ecclesiastical Traditions have, unless the same keeper of
the divine doctrine had been also present. For that which is imprinted in
brass, may be rased and blotted out, and the brass it self may be consumed
by fire. But those things which are imprinted in the hearts of Christians by
the holy Ghost, can never perish, or be any way changed.

5. And what we have said of knowing the Apostolical Traditions, is to be
understood whether the Church assembled in a general Council declared it so,
or it became known and manifest by the continual and general custom of the
whole Church. Also whether the question be of Tradition belonging to faith, or
only belonging to rites and Ceremonies. For of the Tradition belonging to faith
(that is to say, of not baptizing again those which are baptized once before
by heretics) are these words of S. Augu^tine. Albeit indeed of this thing,
says he, S. Aug. Tom. 7. contra Cres^on. Gram. l. 1. cap. penu. t.
t^ere can no example be alleged out of Canonical Scriptures, yet
notwithstanding we hold the truth of the same holy Scriptures in t^^s matter,
when we do that which generally the whole Catholic Church holds, the which,
even the authority of the Scriptures themselves commend unto us: so as, because
the holy Scripture cannot err; whosoever seareth to be deceived by the
difficulty or obscurity of this question, let him go to the same Church for
counsel, the which the holy Scripture v^ry clearly shows and S. Aug. Tom.
7de bapt co^t. Donat. l. 4. cap. 14.
demonstrateth unto us. Hitherto S. Augustine. And disputing in another place
against the Donatists, concerning the baptism of Infants. That, says he,
which the whole Catholic Church holds, nor was ordained by general
Counsels, but yet always kept and observed by all, is most truly to be
believed to have been delivered unto us by Apostolical authority. S. Aug. Tom.

l. 3. c. ^. sect. 10. in medio.


6. But of the Ecclesiastical rites and Ceremonies, the same S. Augustine
speaks in this manner. If the Catholic Church through the whole world hold
and practice any thing, it is a sign of great madness to dispute, whether it
is to be done so, or not. By which words of S. Augustine it may easily be
understood, what was the opinion and uniform doctrine of the whole ancient
Church concerning this point. For our Adversaries themselves do say, that S.
Augustine was a most faithful witness of antiquity. Unto whom I refer the
Readers, if they desire to know certainly any more of the sense of Antiquity,

The end of the first Controversy.
THE SECOND CONTROVERSY.
OF THE PROPERTIES OF OF THE TRVE CHVRCH. The first Part of the second
Controversy.
CHAP. I. Of the Properties and Offices of the true Church of Christ in
general.
IN the disputation of the Church, that first of all is to ^e observed; that
whereas our Adversaries have ^rought in, and do hold many erroneous opinions,
they do all proceed out of ignorance of the true definition and Nature of the
Church. It is a true saying of the Apostle, that they which 1. Tim. v. 6. and 7.
err and w^nder from the true faith, are converted into vain talk desirous
to be Doctors of the Law, not understanding neither what things they speak,
nor of what they affirm. For if our Adversaries did well understand, or could
conceive what is imported by the Name and Nature of the Church, they would
never affirm so many absurdityes of the Church of Christ. We will therefore
first of all declare and explicate, what is to be understood properly by the
name ^of the Church.

2. But this best of all is declared by the Properties of the Church of Christ,
and by her Offices commended unto us in the holy Scripture it self: and those
we call Properties which do agree with the Church as she has relation unto
Christ her chief head and Pastor. But those we call her Offices which the
Church exercises toward her Children. There are indeed many properties of the
Church assigned by holy Scripture, but it shall suffice us to allege and note
these five only.

3. The first is, that the Church is the spouse of Christ, I will betroth thee
unto me Osee 2. 19. and 20.
for ever (says the Prophet Osee:) and again: I will betroth thee unto me in
says. And Isaias: The bridegroom will rejoice in his bride, and thy Isa. 6^.
v. 5.
God (she speaks unto the Church) shall rejoice in thee. Christ also by the
Prophet Solomon says, Come o my spouse from Libanus. Cant. 4. v. 8.
In the new Testament also, the Church is called the spouse of Christ. He which
has the bryde, says S. John Baptist is the bridegroom. Joan. 3. v. 19.
And the Apostle: I have despoused you to one man, to present you a chaste
Virgin unto Christ. 2. Cor. 11. v. 2. Apoc. vlt. v. 27. Romans 12. v. 5. 1. Cor.
12. v. 27. 1. ^phes. 1. v. 22. and 23.
Lastly, S. Joan Evangelist in his Revelations says, the brydegrome and bryde
do say, Come.

4. The second is, that the Church is the mystical body of Christ. We being
many (says the Apostle) are one body in Christ: and again, you are the body
of Christ and members of member: and in another place: And he has made him (to
wit Christ) head over all the Church, which is his body.

5. The third property is, that the Church is the Kingdom of Christ. Our Lord
shall raygne over them (says the Prophet Mich. 4. v. 7.
Micheas) in the mountain of Syon, from hence, now and evermore. And the
Angel, as witnesses Luc. 1. v. 33. Luc. 17. v. 21.
S. Luke, speaks thus of Christ: He shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever. Lastly Christ himself says unto his Disciples, the Kingdom of God is
within you.

6. The fourth property is, that the Psalm ^. v. 8. Psalm. 27. vel 28. v. vlt.
Psalm. 32. vel 3^. v. 12.
Church is the Inheritance of Christ. Ask of me (says God the Father unto his
Son) and I will give thee all Nations for thine Inheritance. And again the
Prophet David says, Save thy people o Lord, and bless thine Inheritance. And
lastly, Blessed is that Nation whose Lord is God thereof; a people whom God
has chosen for his Inheritance.

7. The fifth property is, that the Church is the City of God, and Christ.
Glorious things are spoken of the City of God, Psalm. 86. vel 87. v. 3. Psalm.
45. ve^ 46 v. 5. Matthew. 5. v 14. Hebr. 12. v. 22. 2. Cor. 6. v. 16. 1. Tim. 3.
v. 15. Gal. 4. v. 26.
says the Proper David. And again, the main stream of the river does
co^sort the City of God: and Christ himself says, A City placed upon a
mountain cannot be hid. And hence it is, that the Church is called the
heavenly Jerusalem and Syon, as also the Temple and house of God. You are come,
says the Apostle, to mount Syon, and the City of the living God, heavenly
Jerusalem. And in another place: You are the Temple of the living God. Lastly,
that thou may know how thou ought to co^uerse in the house of God, which
is the Church of the living God.

8. But now the offices of the Church are many, the which may be reduced to
five heads. For the Church, as witnesses the Apostle, is our Mother.

9. A Mother exercises five offices toward her Children. First she conceyueth
them. Secondly she brings them forth. Thirdly she nourishes them. Fourthly
she governs them. Fifthly she defe^deth and preserves them from all
dangers, till they come to the use of reason: all these things the Church
performs unto us, until we meet all with Christ the spouse of the Ephesians. 4.
v. 13.
Church, and our Father, into the unity of faith, and knowledge of the Son of
God, into a perfect man into the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,
as the Apostle speaks.

10. The first Office therefore of the Church is to propound unto all, the word
of God, and that fully (as concerning those things which are necessary to
salvation) sincerely, clearly, and without any error. For the word of God is
the incorruptible seed, whereby we are conceived and borne again, as Christ and
his Apostles do testify. But the Church performs this both by word and
writing whiles she conuerteth Gentiles, Mahumets, Heretics, and Atheists: and
Christ enjoined this Office unto the Church in those Marc. vlt. v. 15.
words, preach you the Gospel unto every creature.

11. The second office of the Church, Ad Titu vlt. v. 5. and Joan. 6. v. 57.
and 58. Matt. vlt. v. 19. Marc. vlt. v. 16. and Luc. 22 v. 19. 1. Cor. 3. v. 2.
and Hebr. 5. v. 12. and 14.
is lawfully to administer the Sacraments. For by these also we are
regenerated, and nourished, strengthened, governed, and defended. This office
also Christ enjoined unto his Church, when he commanded her to baptize, and
administer the other Sacraments.

12. The third office of the Church is to feed those who are borne to Christ,
not only by the Sacraments, but also by the word of God. Feed, says S. Peter,
the flock of God which is among you. But the Church feeds the weaker and
ruder sort of people with milk, and not with stronger meats, as the Apostle
speaks: hence it comes to pass, that the Catholic Catechismes are taught
so much in the Church. But yet she nourishes those which are stronger in
faith, with solid meats, and not only with milk.

13. The fourth office of the Church is to govern, according to those words
Act. 20. v. 28.
of S. Paul* Take heed to your selves, and to the whole flock, wherein the
holy Ghost has placed you Bishops to rule the Church of God. Hence it ensues,
that there have been so many Assemblies and Counsels called together, that
heresies might be condemned, manners reformed, and Ecclesiastical order well
established in all things: also that for this Office there are chosen
Preachers, Pastors, Administrators of the Sacraments, and all other things are
ordained which do concern the right government of the Church.

14. The fifth office of the Church Matthew. 10. v. 32. and 33. Geres. 5. v. 15.
Isa. 54. v. vlt.
is, to defend her children. For this cause she opposes her self against the
Adversaries of Christ. She professes publickely her faith, she fights
continually with the serpent and his seed, she suffers much, and yet always
gets the victory. No weapon, says the Prophet Isay, that is made against
thee, shall proceed, or leuel right. And Matthew. 16. v. 18.
Christ says: Upon this rock I will build my Church and the gates of Hell shall
not prevail against it. And in another place: You shall suffer trouble and
Joan. 16. v. vlt.
pressure in this world, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. By
these properties and offices of the Church, if they be well considered, all the
errors of our Adversaries may easily be confuted, as by that which follows
will manifestly appear.

CHAP. II. That out of the true Church of Christ, there is no salvation.
THE first error is of certain Sectaries of this time, who promise men
salvation out of the Church: But this error is easily refuted by the Scripture.
For that is most clear and evident which Isay the Prophet says, speaking unto
the Church in the person or name of God: That Nation and Kingdom Isa. 60. v.
12.
says he, which has not served thee, shall perish.

2. The same also to be an error, is convinced by the Properties and Offices
of the Church before alleged. For first E^hes. 5. v. 1. 32.
Christ has but one spouse, and acknowledges no other. They shall be two in one
flesh: but I (says the Apostle) speak in Christ and in the Church. So also
Christ speaks of the Church, my dove, and my persect, is one; Cant. 6. v. 8.
Christ is not an adulterer, neither does he beget any children of an
adulteress. For this cause, says S. Cyprian, the spouse of Christ cannot be
an adulte^esse, ^he is not corrupted, S. Cyp^. in tra^^ de unit. E^cles.
and she is chaste. And a little after, Whosoever being separated from the
Church is joined to an adul^er^sse, he is separated from the promises of the
Church Neither shall he ever attain to the rewards S. Aug. Tom. 9. de ^ymh ad
Ca^h lib. 4. c vlt.
of Christ who tears the Church of Christ. He is an al^ene, he is profane, he
is an enemy, he cannot have God for his Father, who has not the Church for his
Mother. Thus he, which last words S. Augustine repeateth out of him.

2. Secondly, he that is without the body of Christ, cannot receive the spirit
of Christ* nor be partaker of the life and Romans 8. v. 9. S. Aug. Tom. 29. tract
2. in. oan.
merits of Christ. But he who has not the spirit of Christ, is not his, as
witnesses the Apostle. S. Augustine d^clareth this very well by the example of
a man's body, whose members cannot live unless they be joined to the body.
Another reason also S. Augustine alleges, taken from the forsaid property of
the Church. None, says he, obtayneth salvation and everlasting lyse but he who
S. Aug* Tom. 7. de unit. Ecc. c. 19.
hat^ Christ to be his head. But none can have Christ to be his head, but he
who is in ^is body which is the Church. So says S. Augustine.

4. Thirdly, the Name only of a Mother does prove this sufficiently. For none
can be conceived nor borne, without a mother, and the child which is borne, if
it leave to suck the mothers breasts will perish for hunger. By which argument
even our wisest Adversaries are convinced. For both Calvin and Beza do
confess Calu. l. 4. nstit. c 1. and Beza. cap. 5. Confess. Art. 1.
this, that even the name only of a mother does convince that which we have
said to be true; yea also the Scripture does often testify, that out of the
bosom of the Church we cannot hope for the rem^ssion of our sins, nor
everlasting salvation: and that the going out of the true Church was always
hateful. And hence it comes to pass, that in the Creed of the Apostles,
first we believe the holy Catholic Church, and then the remission of sins,
and life everlasting, because indeed without this Church none can obtain
either remission of their sins, or life everlasting.

CHAP. III. That the Church of Christ, is to continue for ever.
THE second error of our Adversaries is, that many of them affirm, that the
Church of Christ has not continually endured, but that it sometimes failed.
This error may also be easily refuted by the foresaid propertyes and offices of
the Church. For first the Church is the spouse of Christ, of which he speaks
by the Prophet, I will betroth thee unto me for ever. Christ therefore did not
b^troth his Church unto him Ose. 2. v. 19.
for a few years only.

2. Secondly the Church is the Body of Christ: but Christ cannot be without his
Romans 12. v. 5.
body. And truly it were a monstrous thing to see a living head without a body.

3. Thirdly the Church is the Kingdom of Christ: but the Scriptures do teach
in many places, that this Kingdom Psa^ 83. ve. 89. v. 36.
of Christ shall continue for ever, as Micheae 4. v. 7. Daniel. 2. v. 44.
Ierem. 33. v. 20. and 21. Luc. 1. 32. and 33. Lastly Christ swears in his
Holy One, that is to say, by his Holiness, that the Kingdom of Christ shall
last for ever. Wherefore they endeavor to make Christ himself perjured, who
affirm, that the Kingdom of Christ sometimes perished.

4. Fourthly, the Church is the House Matt. 17. v. 18.
of Christ, the which he built upon a rock, and against which the gates of
hell shall never prevail.

5. Fifthly, the same is proved be the 1. Cor. 11. v. 26.
offices of the Church: The Church shall show the death of our Lord, until he
come. God also gave some as Apostles, and Doctors, who should Ephesians. 4. v. 11.
teach and rule the Church until we meet all in Christ in the end of the
world. When Christ also sent his Disciples to teach all Nations, and to
administer the Sacraments he added this promise, Behold I am with Matt. vlt.
v. vlt.
you all days, even to the consu^mation of the world. By which words, as S.
Hierome well notes, he shows that they are to live always, and that he is
never departed from the faithful belieuers.

6. Lastly, our Adversaries themselves being co^uiuced with the truth of this
matter, do acknowledge, that the holy Calu. lib. 4. Instit. c. 1. sect. 17. in
fine.
Scriptures do testify this in many places. For Calvin and Beza to omit many
others, do acknowledge and prove this out of the Scriptures. Seeing that (says
Beza) the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is continual, it Beza. c. 5. Confess. art.
1.
necessarily follows, that there have always been some to be found who did
acknowledge him for their King.

CHAP. IIII. That this Church which has always continued, has always been
visible.
THE third error of our Adversaries is, that they deny the Church of Christ to
have been always visible. For seeing that they cannot deny, but that the Church
of Christ has always continued, as we have declared in in the precedent
Chapter: and when we demand of them where their Church was for the space of a
thousand years and more, they fly unto a certain invisible Church, which they
say lay hidden for many years. But this error also is easily refuted by the
for said properties, and offices of the true Church.

2. For first the Church is the body of Christ: but this body of Christ was
visible* 1. Cor. 1^. verse. 27.
for the Apostle spoke unto visible men when he said, you are the body of
Christ. Moreover we are made the body of Christ by baptism and the receiving
of the Eucharist, 1. Cor. 10. v. 17. and 1. Cor. 12. v. 13. Ephesians. 4. v. 11. 12.
as witnesses the Apostle. But these Sacraments are visible. Also in this body
of Christ, there are Doctors and Pastors until the consu^matio^ of Saints,
until we meet with Christ: but such persons are also visible. The building also
of the Church is visible, this consu^mation of Saints is visible, that work of
ministry is visible, which the Apostle says shall continue until the coming
of Christ.

2. Secondly the Church is the Kingdom of Christ, but every Kingdom
co^prehendeth in it a visible company of me^ who all acknowledge one King.
Hence it is that God describing by the Prophet Jeremy this Kingdom of Christ,
speaks in this sort of the multitude of men which shall be in the Kingdom of
Christ. Even as (says our Lord) the stars of Heaven Ierem. 31. v. 32.
cannot be numbered, and the sands of the sea measured, so will I multiply the
seed of my servant David, and the Leuits my servants. But such and so great a
multitude of men cannot be invisible.

4. In like manner the Prophet Isay describing the said Kingdom of Christ and
the Covenant of God with it, thus writes. I will make a perpetual league with
Isa. 61. v. 8. and 9.
them, and their seed shall be known in all Nations, and their of spring in the
midst of the people; all that shall see them shall know them, because this is
the seed that God has blessed. Where it is manyfestly said that all Nations,
even the Infidels, as soon as they shall behold and see the Church, they shall
easily know her by the benefits of God bestowed upon her. Calvin himself Calu
in hae^^erba Isaiae.
acknowledges this to be spoken of the Church, and he adds, that this has
not only once been fullfilled, but is daily fulfilled.

5. Lastly if this Kingdom of Christ were sometimes invisible, God himself
(which God forbid we should say) were perjured, who swears that the throne
of Christ, that is to say, his Kingdom, Psalm. 8^. vel 89.
shall be like the sun, and as a perfect moon, and that for ever: but the
sun, and the perfect, or full moon are very visible planets, easily to be
seen of all men, and not invisible.

6. Thirdly the Church of God is that Isa. 2. v. ^. Mi^h. 4. ^. 1. Psalm. 47.
vel 48. v. 9. Dan. 2 v. 35. Matt. 5 v. 14 and 15.
City which is situated upon a most high Mountain, yea upon a Mountain which
is placed upon the top of mountayn^, the which our Lord will stre^gthen for
ever, whereof Christ himself speaks. A City placed upon a mo^ntayne cannot
be hidden: And again. You are the light of the world, neither do they light ^
candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a cadelsticke, that it may give
light unto all which are in the house. Christ therefore has made his S. Aug.
Tom. 9. in 1. Ep. Joan. Tract. 2.
Church not to hide it, but that it might be perspicuous and manifest unto all:
heerupon S. Augustine. What more (says he) shall I say, but that they are
blind who do not see so great a mountain, who shut their eyes against a candle
placed upon a candlestick. And in S. Aug. Tom. 7. de unit. Ecc. c. 1.
another place (he says) that those who see not the Church, had rather as it
were blindfold offend against this mountain then climb up unto it.

7. Fourthly the same is proved by the foresaid offices of the Church, for that
Church must necessarily be visible, which conceyueth and brings forth
Infidells to Christ, by the preaching of the Gospel: for neither they which
do preach are invisible but visible, and the preaching also is visible and not
invisible. That Church also is visible which nourishes Christians with her
public exhortations, instructions, and ministration of Sacraments, and good
examples; which explicateth and keeps the Luc. 10. v. 16. Matt. 18. v. 17.
Scriptures; who governs and prescribes Law and precepts, whom therefore we
must obey. And she is visible, unto whom according to the commaundment of
Christ, all complaints and causes are to be brought. And Lastly she is visible,
of whom in our adversities we must demand help and comfort, who publicly
confesses Christ, who fights with the serpent, and getting the victory
triumphs against him, and moreover she exercises all those offices which are
before alleged. Supra. c. 1.


8. Fifthly, if the visible Church should once perish* that article of the
Creed were falls, I believe in the Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints. For
that Church which is Catholic or universal, cannot be invisible; that Church
which is dilated Psalm. 88. v. 33.
or spread abroad throughout the whole world cannot be but very visible and
conspicuous, and that not in one only place, but in many. And hence it comes
to pass, that the true Church is compared to the Sun and the Moon, the
which are very visible planets, and easily to be seen of all. Neither can
there be this believed communion of Saints* unless the said Saints mutually be
manifest and 1 Cor. v. 12. 21. 26.
visible one unto another, seeing that this communication (as the Apostle says)
consists in the continual help which one member affoardeth unto another, but
none can affoard any help to that which is invisible and unknown. Moreover
this communication of offices is very sensible and visible. That also is
visible S. Aug. Tom. 2. Ep. 170. ad Sever.
which is a corporal substance and generally in many places. Wherefore S.
Augustine says; Yt is an easy matter for thee to behold and see that City
which is situated upon a mountain, of whom our Lord in the Gospel says,
that it cannot be bidden. For she is the Catholic Church, whereupon she is
called in Greek (...) Matt. 5. v. 14.
because she is published and spread over all the whole world, of whom it is
not lawful for any to be ignorant, and therefore according to the saying of our
Lord Jesus Christ, she cannot be hidden. Hitherto S. Augustine.

9. Sixthly, that Church is visible which contains in it as well the good Calu.
l. 4. I^stit. c. 1. sect. 7.
as the evil, and as well the predestinate as the reprobate, as our Adversaries
themselves acknowledge, who will have the invisible Church to consist of those
only Matt. 1^. v. ^8.
which are predestinate. But that the Church which contains in it as well the
evil as the good, shall continue unto Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 1. sect. 13. in
fine. and Beza c. 5. suae Cons. art. 7.
the end of the world, those words of Christ, suffer both to grow till
harvest, do evidently demo^strate unto us. Yea eue^ our Adversaries themselves
do plainly confess that the holy Scripture does declare this by many
Parables. It may therefore be gathered out of holy Scriptures even by the
judgment of our Adversaries, that there is not only an invisible, but also a
visible Church, to wit, wherein the good are mixed with the bad, which shall
always continue till the end of the world.

10. Seauenthly, it is all one to affirm the Church to be invisible, and to
affirm, that it has wholly perished, and Supra cap. 3.
that there is no Church at all, the which as we have declared before is most
absurd. For this invisible Church of our Adversaries, can afford no help to
any, seeing that she is not known to any but only unto God: according to that
saying of the Apostle* God knows who are his. For our Adversaries will have
the predestinate 2. Tim. 2. v. 19.
only to belong unto this their invisible Church, as we have now declared, who
are only known unto God, and unknown unto all others.

11. Hither also it belongs, that those could not be Saints and predestined
who have been for these many ages past in that invisible Church of our
Adversaries. For those (if per^^uenture there were any) neither durst publikel^
profess Christ, nor preach openly the Gospel, but terrified with humane
fear, have done all things by dissimulation and hypocrisy, least they might
be bewrayed and made known unto others (for otherwise they should have been
visible and not invisible.) Luc. 9. v. 26.
But Christ says, that he, that shall be ashamed of me, and that which I
teach, him the son of man will be ashamed o^, when he shall come in his Majesty.

12. Lastly our Adversaries being urged with so many and invincible reasons,
see well enough, especially the wiser sort of them, how absurd the doctrine of
their invisible Church is. And therefore many of them now adays acknowledge the
Church of Christ to have been always visible: and moreover that this visible
Church remained still in the Popedom, as they speak. For they cannot assign
any other visible and ever continuing Church, besides that of Rome, but least
they be convinced of fal^hood by the authority of this visible Church they
seek out some other evasion, for they say this visible Church may, yea has
often erred in matters of faith. The which error we will Cap. 7. seq.
confu^e a little after, as soon as we have answered the arguments, objected by
our Adversaries against this Chapter.

CHAP. V. The arguments against the visible Church are confuted.
MANY of our Adversaries reasons do not so much prove that Infr. c. 7.
the visible Church has perished and decayed, as that it has erred in faith;
the which therefore shall be confuted afterward, when we declare that the Church
cannot err in matters of faith. The rest of their arguments are Tom. 2. Epi.
48. and Tom. 7. de. vni. Eccles. c. ^^. and ad. Donat. post col. ^^ 20. in.
fine. 3. Reg. 19. v. 10. Calu in ^r^f^. ^^arum ^^st. Beza ^. 5. suae Confess.
^rt. 9.
almost all one with the old reasons of the Donatists. For they in times past
affirmed that the Church of Christ had perished through out the whole world,
but only in Africa. Unto whom S. Augustine answers very well in many places.
But we will only here briefly examine the more probable arguments, and now a
days more used by our Adversaries.

2. The first argument is taken out of those words of the Prophet Elias, I am
left alone, and they seek my life. I answer that this argument is of no
moment, albeit our Adversaries Calvin and Beza do often use it. For Elias does
not speak of the whole Church, but only of the Kingdom of Israel, wherein the
wicked King Achab 3. Reg. 16. v. 18.
then reigned, albeit in it also there were seven thousand men who did not
adore Baal, and who made a visible Church. Moreover at that very time Iosaphat
a very pious and godly King reigned, and there was also the temple of God, and
Priests, and Sacrifice, as also public, solemn, and daily service of God: yea
out of the second book of Paralippomeno^ we gather that King Iosaphat labored
very much to conserve 2. Paral. 19. v. 4. and seq.
and increase the honor and worship of God: neither was the number of them
little, who professed publicly the true Religion. For in the same book are
accounted and numbered more then eleauen hundred thousand strong souldiars,
besides women and others less sit for war; by which it appears that the
Church of 2. Paral. 17. v. 14. and seq.
God was not invisible in Iosaphats Kingdom, but rather very visible and
co^spicuous. But Elias only complained of the Kingdom of Israel: they, to wit,
the children of Israel, and not the children of Judah, have 3. Reg. 19. v. 10.
forsaken thy Covenant. Neither do we deny but that in some one or other
Kingdom there might sometimes peradventure have been few or no Christians,
whiles in far more places the Church of God was very manifest and visible.
But that the Church of Christ was no where to be found in the whole world, is
most absurd and expressly against the holy Scriptures.

3. The second argument is taken out of many places of Isay and Jeremy, wherein
those Prophets complain, that all the Jews did transgress the Covenant made
with God. Moreover they object the small number of those who were sometimes in
the ancient Church before Christ's time, or even in Christ's time before the
Gospel was promulgated, and here they make many digressions to Noe and Adam
himself. The very same argument the Donatists also used, as the words of
Bishop P^^ili^n testify related by S. Augustine. But Vide S. August. Tom. 7. de
vn^t. Eccl c. 13. S. Aug. Tom. 7. in lib. ad Don it. post ^oll. c. 20. in fine.
S. Augustine answers very well to those general complaints of the Prophets,
that the holy Scripture has a peculiar phrase o^ manner of speaking, who so
reprehendeth the evil as though every one of that company of people were
wicked men, and so commends the good, as if they were all such: and this S.
Augustine proves in the same chapter out of diverse places of the holy
Scripture.

4. Our Adversaries also who would seem skillfull and cunning in the Hebrew
and Greek language, should call to mind that as well the general particle
amongst the Hebrews called col, as that other which De voce Col, vide Galat. l.
5. c. 4. Joan. Fost. Luth. and Io. Mer. Call. in radic^. Call. in c. 2. Philip.

answers unto it in the Greek (...) or (...) is often used in holy
Scripture, not generally for every thing without any exception, but for that
which commonly is wont to be done; as also, non, pro singulis ge^erum, sed, pro
generibus singulorum, the which not only the Hebrew Lexicons written by our
Adversaries themselves do plainly demo^strate, but also their chief and
principal ringleaders Calvin and Beza. The later whereof adds also that we
have observed, that a general particle is almost in every leaf of holy
Scripture used indefinitely. It is therefore most true which S. Augustine says,
that this word ( all) in these kind of places, is taken for many, or for that
which was common every where, as Calvin and Beza say: for otherwise it is well
enough known that in the time of the Prophet Isay there were some holy Kings,
as Ozias and Ezechias in Jury, as also those Prophets Ozeas, Amos, and Micheas:
moreover in the time of Jeremy there lived ^he good King Josias, and the good
prophets Ezechiel, Daniel, and Sophonias. Therefore those things which Isay and
Hiere^y do say, cannot be understood of all v^iuersally.

5. The other places which our Adversaries S. Aug. Tom. 2. Epist. 48. ad V
incentium.
allege, do prove that there a^^ at sometimes but a few in the Church ^ but
they do not prove, that the say^ Church was invisible. Yea (as S. Aug^stine
disputing against the Donatists we^ observes) when the Church of God ^ most
vexed with the persecutions of the wicked, and seems to be almost oppre^ see
therewith, then is she most divine i^ such her members as are renewed for
co^rage and constancy: for faith and obedience Mat. 1. v. ^8.
toward God was more eminent i^ one Noe or Abraham, then in ten thousand
others.

6. Lastly this our disputation is not properly of the ancient Church which w^
Eusebius in Cron. Orosi^^ in hist. Gen^b. in sua Cono. Sand. de visib. Monar*
chapter l. 7. in prin. Coc^iu^ Tom. 1. lib 8. Art. 2.
before Christ's time, but of that whi^ ensued the promulgation of the Gospe^
till this our present age, whereof Chri^ says, Upon this rock I will build my
Church, ^ the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. F^ albeit the Church
has been always v^sible even from the beginning of the wor^ till the coming
of Christ, as Paulus Orosi^ and Eus^bius have, out of the holy Scripture in
every age, declared; in this our age al^ Genebrard, Sanders, and Coccius have
brief^ demonstrated the same: Yet notwithstanding before the coming of Christ,
t^ whole Church of God was in a manner Psalm. 75. v. 2. and Psalm. 147. v. vlt.
concluded into greater straits of persons and places, according to those words
of the Prophet David: God was known in Jury, and again: He has not done thus
to every Nation, and he has not manifested, or made known, his judgment unto
them. But amongst the Gentiles there were but few who acknowledged and rightly
worshipped God. Wherefore the true Church was often reduced unto a few persons
in number, but S. Aug. Tom. 2. Epist. 84. ad V incent.
notwithstanding ever visible, and those very eminent in sanctity and
holiness, as is declared by S Augustins words already alleged. But the state
and condition of the Church of Christ is far different after the Genes. 22.
v. 18.
promulgatio^ of the Ghospel from that other: for now that blessed seed of
Abraham is come, wherein all the Nations of the earth were to be Blessed: now
those prophesies of Christ's inheritance and Kingdoms are fullfilled. Psalm. 2.
v. 8.
Ask of me and I will give thee, all Nations for thy inheritance, and the
bounds of the whole earth for thy Psalm. 71. v. 8.
^^ssession. Also, He shall govern and reign from sea to sea, and from the
^yuer to the end of the whole world. And again, All the Kings of the earth
^^all adore him, and all Nations shall serve him. Moreover, Our Lord has
prepared his holy arm Ibid. v. 1^. Isa. 52. v. 10.
^^ the eyes of all Nations, and all the limits of the ^rth shall see the
salvation of our Lord and God. When S. Augustine had alleged this place among
others against the Donatists, admiring their great madness and ignorance who
affirm the Church to be either invisible, or to lie lurking in some od place
only, brake forth into these most true S. Aug. To^. 7. de unit. Eccles. c. 7.
words worthy of so great a Doctor, Who is says he, so deaf, who is so mad,
and who so foolish to contradict these so clear and evident testimonies, but
he which knows not what he speaks? And truly that the Church of God was
far more known and spread over the whole world after the promulgation of the
Gospel even in the Apostles time then it ever was in the time of the law,
those words of the Apostle do sufficiently declare. But Romans 10. v. 18.
I say, have they not heard? And ^^^tes into all earth has the sound of them
gone forth, and unto the Rom 1. v. ^8
ends of the whole world the words of them. And again speaking unto the Roman
Church he says, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
because your says is renewed in the whole world.

7. Moreover from the Apostle^ time, till this our present age, the Church of
Christ has bin not only visible, but also spread abroad, known and most
famous throughout diverse Kingdoms of the world, as many historiographers,
as well Ecclesiastical as profane do testify, and the worthy Cardinal C^sar
Bar^^ius has evidently declared, and that not only throughout all ages, but
also every S. Aug. Tom. 7. de unit. Ecc. cap. 7.
year: in so much that those who do not consent and agree heereunto, are not
only to be accounted Infidels, but as S. Augustine speaks very fitly and
truly, men out of their wits.

CHAP. VI. Diverse other Arguments of our Adversaries against the visible
Church, are confuted.
THE third argument of our Adversaries whereby they impugn the visible Church,
is this: The Holy Scripture compares the Church to the Moon, but the Moon
does often times not appear, as it happens in the new moon, and in the
Eclips. I answer, that we must not seek for a similitude or likeness in all
things betwixt the Church and the moon, for otherwise the Church of Christ
should neither see, not understand, nor believe, and it should be altogether
without life as the Moon is. But in this matter that similitude or liknesse
betwixt the Church and the moon, is only to be sought out, in which the
Scripture compares the Church to the moon; but the Scripture does not compare
the Church to the Moon as she is a mutable planet, but as she is beautiful in
her self. Beautiful (says Cant. 6. v. 9.
Solomon) is the moon, but in mutuability the Scriptur compares a fool to
the moon, but not the Church. A fool (says the Eccl. 27. v. 12.
Wiseman) is changed as the moon. Moreover the Church of Christ is not
compared to every moon, but only to the moon, Isa. 60. v. 26.
when she is in her fullness and perfection, yea to the moon which is never
diminished nor fails: hence are those words of the Prophet Isay, which
Calvin acknowledges Call. in illa verba*
are to be understood of the Church, Thy sun shall neuermore be set, and thy
moon shall not be diminished (or as Calvin translateth it) shall not be
hidden. Lastly S. John says, that the moon is under the feet of the Church,
that thereby we may understand that the Church of Christ by the virtue of the
sun (to wit Christ himself, where withal she is wholly invested and Apo. 12.
v. 1.
adorned) is free from all mutability in matters of faith.

2. The fourth argument. These things which we believe by faith are invisible,
but by faith we believe there is a Catholic Church, as appears by the
Apostles Creed, therefore the Catholic Church is invisible and not visible. I
answer that this is a weak argument, albeit Calu. l. 4. ^nstit. c. ^* sect.
1. in prin^.
Calvin also uses it. For if it were not* it would prove that the holy
Scripture were also invisible, because we believe also the holy Scripture by
faith, yea it would also prove even our Adversaries Church to be as yet
invisible, for they as yet believe their Church by faith, and yet they confess
that their Church is now visible. And truly if their Church had remained still
invisible, they had never caused so many tumults in the Christian
Commonwealth. But certainly even as in the holy Scriptures we see one thing
and believe another, we see the letters and characters, the which the Infidels
also see, but we believe that the Scripture is most true in all things, the
which they do not believe: so we s^ that the Church of Christ is extant, the
which also the Infidels do see; for Turks and Jews do very well know that
there is a Pope, and that there are Bishops, Princes, and Christian Nations:
but we believe that this Church which we see is an holy Church, is governed and
directed by the holy Ghost, and that she cannot err in matters of faith, all
which the Infidels do not believe.

3. The fifth argument. None is in the Church but by faith, but faith is
invisible, therefore the Church also is invisible. I answer, that this is a
very weak consequence, for otherwise we might reason thus: None is man but by
a reasonable soul, but the soul of man endued with the use of reason, is
invisible, therefore the whole man also is invisible. Also, no Scripture is to
be accounetd holy but by the authority of God, but this authority is invisible,
therefore the Scripture also is inu^sible. For it is not necessary that a
thing may be called visible, that the chief part or reason thereof be visible,
but it sufficieth if any part thereof be visible, as manifestly appears in all
visible substances, for their chief parts, to wit, their substantial matter
and form are things invisible.

4. Secondly I answer, that the faith whereby a man is made a member of the
visible Church is not only an interior faith which is not to be seen, but
that which is evidently seen and declared by exterior signs: as for example
by confessing publicly the said faith, by receiving the Sacraments, and such
other exterior acts. The which is so true, that this exterior profession of
our faith only, without the interior faith, suffices that a man become a
member of the visible Church, as Bellarmine well proves: Bell. l. 3. de milit.
Eccl. c. ^0
seeing that otherwise none could be certain of his Prelate or Pastor, because
none can see the faith or mind o^ another.

5. Hence also it is, that not only the predestinate and just men are members
of the visible Church, but also such as be hypocrites and wicked men, who
profess their faith, according to those words of Joan. ^^. v. 2. Ibid. v. 6.
Christ: Every branch in me, not bearing fruit, he will take it away. And, if
any abide not in me, he shall be cast forth: by whcih words Christ shows that
they also who do not remain in him, that is to say, those which are not
predestinate, and those which do not bring forth any fruit, that is to say, bad
Christians, are in him, that is to say, in his visible body which is the
Church: the which also almost all our Adversaries confess, as we have said
before, and Bellarmine proves more at large.

6. The sixth argument our Adversaries Apoc. 12 v. ^. 14.
deduce out of the Apocalypse, wherein it is said, That a woman ^^uested with
the sun, which signifies the true Church, fled into the desert, and remained
there for the space of 1260. days, that is to say, as our Adversaries
interpret it, a thousand two hundred and sixty years. Out of which they
infer, that the Church remained invisible as it were in the desert these
thousand two hundred and sixty years last past. I answer, that this is a
vicious argument for many reasons. For first, it is very absurd, to think that
the Church of Christ did ly hidden and invisible these thousand two hundred
sixty years past. For thereupon it would ensue that the Church of Christ was
invisible then when it most flourished, and was spread abroad over the whole
world: as for example in the times of S. Augustine, Ambrose, Hilary,
Athanasius, Hierome, Chrysostom, Cyril etc. Yea in the time also of all the
ancient Councels, the which our Adversaries Confess. Rupell. Art. 6.
themselves do admit in their confession of faith. For all these Fathers and
ancient Councels have been within the space of the forsaid thousand two hundred
and sixty years, the which our Adversaries do account from Pope Siluester till
Luthers time, wherefore this place of the Apo^^lyps is not to be understood of
years, but literally of days only.

7. Moreover it is not certain that by this word ( desert) is understood any
solitary place, or such as is deprived of all the society or comfor of men. For
Primasius S. Prima. in cap. 12. Apoc.
Augustines scholar says, that by the foresaid word is signified the whole
world, the which also that desert signified, through the which the Children of
Israel Numer. 14. v. 34.
passed before they came to the land of Promise: even as by the said land of
Promise was also signified the everlasting life. Some others will have the
foresaid word ( desert) to signfy a departure, or forsaking of all sins and
vices, and all other pleasures of this world, according to that sa^ng of the
Prophet Osee. I will carry and lead her into the desert, and I will speak unto
Osee. v. 14. Psalm. 54. v. 8.
her heart. And that of David: Behold flying away, I went far off, and I
remained in the desert.

8. Lastly albeit we should grant that this desert were some wyld or forsaken
place, yet neu^rthelesse it could not be gathered thereby, that the Church of
Christ either was, or ever shall be invisible. For neither this woman which fled
into the wilderness, signifies the whole Church of Christ, but some one
famous Church the which Antichrist shall persecure most of all, because it will
strongly oppose it self against his impiety and wickedness. And in the end of
the forsaid vision S. John plainly affirms, that the Dragon Apoc. ^2* v. 17.
after the delivery of that woman shall make war against the rest of her seed
who keep the commandme^ts of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ:
therefore besides that woman, there will be some out of the desert who will
publicly profess the true faith of Christ, against whom for that cause the
Dragon will fight.

9. But that we may now conclude this Controversy of the visible Church, seeing
that Christ our Lord came into this world, that he might make open, and known
the way to eternal sauation not to one Nation or age only, but indeed to the
whole world and all posterity, it is a very absurd thing to think, that this
one only way to eternal salvation which is the true Church of Christ, remained
hidden and unknown to all Nations for so many ages past.

CHAP. VII. That this visible true Church of Christ cannot err in matters of
faith.
NOTHING can be said more absurdly, the^ that the true Church of Christ can
err in matters of faith, and yet there is nothing which the Sectaries of this
time do hold and defend with greater pertinacy, not without just cause, for
they see very well that it cannot be denied, but that the true Church of Christ
has for these many years past remained still among Catholics only visible,
as afterward we shall more clearly declare: but if they should also grant that
this visible Church cannot err, they should ouerthow themselves by their own
confession. Wherefore to the end they may still have some corner or hole to
slip out at, they affirm, that the true Church of Christ both has erred, and
still does err in points of faith. Then the which nothing certainly is more
absurd, especially seeing that they affirm that it has erred not in things of
small moment, but in the principal and chiefest points of faith, which are
plainly necesrary to eternal salvation; yea also that it has fallen into
manifest Idolatry. Moreover, that it has not only failed and staggered in
faith, and has publicly taught many errors against faith, but has also
compelled and forced by threats and torments all to Idolatry. And lastly, that
it has done thus, not only for the space of one year, but for a thousand or
at least 900. years. All which how absurd they are, we will now declare.

2. But to the end that all which we are to say hereafter of this matter may be
the better understood, we must note here that when we affirm that the Church
cannot err in faith, that by this word ( faith) we understand not only that
invisible faith which is in our mind, but also visible, that is to say, the
public doctrine of the whole Church, which is proposed or set down to be
believed of all. Wherefore when we affirm, that the Church cannot err in
matters of faith, we affirm also, that the doctrine or points of faith, the
which the Church of God sets down as the most certain and undoubted word
of God, cannot be false, but the very word of God it self, which I will
clearly declare by these arguments.

2. The first argument is deduced out Supr h^ ipsa contro. c. 1.
of all those properties and offices of the true Church before alleged out of
Scripture. For the true faith being once taken away, all the foresaid
properties of the Church must needs perish, and all her offices must cease.
For the Church ca^ neither be the spouse of Christ, nor the bod^, nor the
Kingdom, nor the inheritance, nor the temple of Christ without faith: but
neither can the Church without faith and the true doctrine thereof, either
conceive, bring forth, nouri^h, govern, or defend Christ's flock. And in this
manner the Church of Christ for so many ages had lost Supr. c. 1. h^ius co^tro.
all her properties, and had intermitted all her proper offices, contrary to so
many and so clear promises of holy Writ before alleged.

4. The second argument is deduced out of most clear testimonies of holy
Scripture, which teach that the Church cannot err in faith. For first Christ
himself V. at. 16. v. 18.
affirms, that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church. But
if the Church could err in faith, the gates of hell for so many ages past had
prevailed against her.

5. Moreover God speaks thus by Isa 59. v. vl^.
his Prophet Isay of the Covenant of the new Testament. This is my league with
them says our Lord, my spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put
in thy mouth, shall not departout of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy
seed, and out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, satthour Lord, from hence forth
even to the worlds end. But in our Adversaries opinion the words which God has
put into the mouth of the Church, had departed many ages out of her mouth.

6. Lastly the Apostle affirms, that the Church is the Pillar and stability
of truth. ^. Tim. 1. v. 9.
But if the Church could err in faith, and teach publicly against the word of
God, it should be the Pillar rather of falsehood then of truth. Some of our
Adversaries do a^swere unto this place, that the church is called indeed the
Pillar of truth, because it does not err when it follows, and is agreeable
unto the word of God, yet nevertheless it erreth when it disagreeth from the
word of God. But this is a very frivolous answer. For according unto this
interpretation, every Church of Heretics, of Jews, Turks, yea of the Devils
themselves should be the Pillar of truth. For none of these erreth, when it is
agreeable to the word of God. But a Pillar is that which necessarily and always
vpholdeth that which it strengthens, and whose pillar it is: wherefore the
Church should not be the Pillar of truth, unless it always stick and be
joined with the truth, and vphould it. Calvin therefore Calu. l. 4. Inst. c. 2.
sect. 1. in fine.
co^uinced by the evidence of the truth, writes, that if the true Church be
the Pillar of truth, it is most certain* that the Kingdom where lies and
falsehood rargneth, cannot be the true Church. Thus Calvin.

7. The third argument is deduced out of diverse Absurdities which ensue out of
the doctrine of our Adversaries. The first absurdity is, that the Apostles
Creed were false wherein we believe the holy Catholic Church. For that Church
cannot be holy which wants the true faith, which reaches falsities and
wickedness, which forces all men to Idolatry.

8. The second absurdity is, that Christ himself and the holy Ghost should
err and teach things both false and wicked. For the doctrine of the Church is
not so Luc. 10. v. 16. Joan. 14. v. 26. Act. 15. v. 28.
much the doctrine of the Church, as it is of Christ and of the holy Ghost,
VV^o hear th you (says Christ) hears me: and in another place: The
Paraclete* the holy Ghost whom my Father will send you in my name, he will
teach you all things. And the Apostles said, It seems good to the holy
G^ost, and to us. Lastly God himself by his Prophet speaking unto the Church
affirms, that his holy Spirit is in the Church, and that he has put his
words into the mouth of the Church, which shall never be taken out of her
mouth, from hence forth till the end of the world. Wherefore if the Church
could err in the doctrine of faith* Christ also, the holy Ghost, and God
himself should err.

6. The third absurdity is, that a building could consist and stand without a
foundation. For the faith of Christ is the foundation of the Church. If yet,
says the Apostle, you continue in the faith grounded Colos. 1. v. 19.
and stable. And in another place he teaches, that the Church is grounded upon
Ephesians. 2. v. 20.
the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets: but the foundation being taken
away, the building must needs fall. This absurdity is so manifest, that it
forced Calvin to confess this very truth which now we ^each to be evidently
convinced out of S. Paul's words. If, says he, the doctrine of the Apostles and
Prophets be the foundation of the Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 2. sect. 1.
Church, take away that doctrine, and how can the building stand? Thus Calvin.

10. The fourth absurdity is, that the true Church should consist and be
without her proper and essential form, no otherwise then if one should say,
that a true and living man might consist and be without his soul. For the true
faith and the true preaching thereof, are as it were the essential forms of
the Church. Calu. l. 4. Inutit. c. 2. sect 12.
Calvin also acknowledges this absurdity when he writes, that the faith of
the Church being taken away, there must needs follow the utter overthrow of
religion, even as the life of man is overthrown and taken away, if he be
stabbed with a dagger, or deadly wounded at the heart.

11. The fourth argument is deduced out of the manifest contradictions which
follow of the contrary doctrine. For they who co^^e^d that the true Church of
Christ does err in faith, do not indeed know what they say: for that is the
only true Church of Christ which retayneth and keeps still the name, and the
sincere faith of Christ; but that is the false Church of Christ which only
professes the name of Christ but erreth in faith. Wherefore to say that the
Church of Christ erreth in faith, is all one, as to say, that the true Church
is not the true Church, but the false, which implies a contradiction.

12. The fifth argument is deduced out of those things which our Adversaries do
grant unto us. For the common Insrae^ 18. huiu^ Controu.
doctrine of our Adversaries is, as we will show hereafter, that the sincere
preaching of the word of God, and lawful administration of Sacraments, are the
marks and signs of the true Church, without which it cannot consist: therefore
it necessarily follows, that they must also admit, that the true Church
cannot err in faith, and in the true preaching of the word of God. For that
Church cannot sincerely preach the word of God who foully erreth in points of
faith, and in the Calu. l. 4. Instit. cap. 2. sect, ^. and cap. 8. sect 12. and
13.
true preaching thereof. Calvin also out of diverse places of Scripture does
prove that it is a false Church and not a true, which erreth in the principal
points of faith, and he acknowledges, that the true Church cannot err
therein, they being necessary to salvation. Beza in like manner Bezain l. de
Ecc. notis. volum. 3. Tract. Theol.
writes, that the true Church cannot err in the chief points of faith,
albeit he says, that it erreth in lesser matters, the which distinction of
points of faith he has taken out of Calvin. The Church therefore cannot err at
the least in chief points Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 1. sect. 12.
of faith, eue^ in our Adversaries judgments.

12. Our Adversaries heap together a great many of arguments, but they are
such as may easily be answered. For whereas they know that their arguments are
but weak and almost nothing wort^* they endeavor by the multitude thereof to
oppress the truth, or at the least to obscure and hide it. Many of them when
they manifestly see, that it is impossible that the true Church can consist or
be without faith, they craftily feygne that the Calu. l. 4. Instit. cap. 2.
sect. 2.
Controversy betwixt us is not of this matter, but of some other far different,
that is to say, of that whereof none ever doubts: so deals Calvin with us.
For when he had confessed that to be the false Church and not the true which
erreth in principal points of faith and consequently that the true Church
cannot err herein, as out of his own words we have already declared, at the
last he feigneth that the controversy in this matter is not whether the Church
can err or no, but whether she may err, if she take not for her companion the
word of God; Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 8. sect. 13. and 15.
and that we affi^me, that whatsoever she shall decree, either without or
besides the word of God, that the same is to be accounted as a most certain
oracle of God: But that he and his affirm, that therefore the Church cannot
err, because it permits it self to be directed and governed by the said
word of God, and because it teaches nothing but out of the word of God. But
this is a mere slaunder^ or there can no Catholic be found, who does not
acknowledge that the Church permits it self to be directed in all things by
the word of God, Supra Contro. 1. ca. 2.
seeing that the sole word of God is the object of faith, as we have said
before: wherefore the true Church proposes nothing else unto us to be believed
with a Catholic faith, but the most sincere and true word of God. But in this
matter only is the controversy betwixt us and our Adversaries, that they
acknowledge only the written word of the holy Scripture to be the true word of
God: but we not only Supr. Contro. 1. c. 25. and sequen.
acknowledge the written word, but also that which was preached and delivered
unto us by Christ and his Apostles: Whereof we have said enough in the precedent
disputation.

14. Some others by frivolous distinctions endeavor to hyde this their error,
and to obscure and darken most clear and perspicuous matters, whereas
notwithstanding in very truth they can say nothing cls but that which we have
already Philip de Mo^nay Tract. de Eccles. c 2.
taught. For they invent and imagine a twofold Church, the one pure, the other
impure, wherein they place even Heretics themselves: this which is impure, say
they, erreth in faith, but not that which is pure. But we acknowledge only one
holy and Catholic Church of Christ with the Creed of the Apostles, and that of
the Council of Nice, and we willingly yield unto them their impure Church
wherein the Heretics are. For none doubts but that such a Church may err. But
as this is a false and not the true Church of Christ; so of it, is not this
present Controversy, but only of the true and pure Church of Christ.

15. Others distinguish the Church into visible and invisible, and they say,
that the invisible Church cannot err, but Supr. hac ipsa cont. cap. 4.
the visible may err. But we have now already declared, that the true Church
of Christ must needs be visible. Wherefore this distinction is now sufficiently
refuted. And truly it imports but a little whether that their invisible
Church can err or not err, seeing that it cannot be seen or known of any,
and consequently cannot be profitable unto any.

16. There are also some of the later Sectaries who distinguish, and divide the
Church, into the Church of the Saints which Iunius in Bellarm. Contr. 1. l. 4.
c. 10. nota 8.
are in Heaven, and into that which remains fighting here upon earth. And
they say, that the Church triumpha^t of Saints cannot err in faith, or in the
doctrine of faith: but the Church militant may err. But this is a ridiculous
distinction. First Hebr. 21. v. 1.
because the Saints haven ot faith, but a clear vision of God, for as the
Apostle witnesses, Faith concerns things which do not appear: wherefore if
at any time faith perished upon earth, without al doubt it could not be found
in heaven, neither must we exprect the doctrine of faith from heaven, as the
Anabaptists do who seek for revelations from heaven, but we must look to
receive it from the Supr. c. 1. huius controuersiae.
Church militant upon earth. Moreover the properties and offices of the Church
of Christ before alleged out of holy Scripture do not agree, as is manifest,
to the Church triumphant of Saints, but to the Church milita^t upon earth. For
neither is that Church of the Saints betrothed unto Christ by faith, neither
are the Saints those who preach unto us the word of God, who administer the
Sacraments unto us, and who execute the other offices of the Church, but men
living upon earth: wherefore they run in vain to this heavenly Church whereof
we do not here dispute.

17. Moreover, that is also a very weak reason, whereby they think that Iunius
ibid. nota 8.
they convince, that the Church militant upon earth may err. This Church
(says he) militant upon earth, is imperfect, and therefore she may err, even
in explicating the doctrine of says, for otherwise a perfect effect might
proceed 1. Cor. 13^ per totu^ caput.
from an imperfect cause. So ^e. As though forsooth* there could be no other
imperfection in the Church, besides infidelity or error, in explicating the
doctrine of faith, or as though the whole perfection of the Church consisted in
faith only, and in the doctrine thereof, and not also in charity and other
gifte^ of God, as the Apostle declares at large. Or lastly, as though this
perfection of the Church which consists in a right faith, and a good
explication of the doctrine thereof, could proceed from the militant Church
only, and not rather from a most perfect cause, to wit, from the holy Ghost who
continually ad Romans 8. v. 26.
governs the Church, and as the Apostle says, helps her infirmity and
imperfection.

18. Lastly when our Adversaries Ita Philip. Mor. Tract. de Eccles. cap. 9.
Genes. 3. v. 6.
can by no places of Scripture nor other reasons prove, that the Church has
erred they g^e about to persuade i^ by many examples. And here they be^in a
discourse from our first Father Adam till these our da^es. For first they say,
that Adam lost his faith, and so likewise his wy^e Eve, when they both eat of
the for^idd^n fruit, and consequently the wholly Church then erred in faith.
Then they run through all the old Testament till Christ's time, and heap
together many places which say, that those who lived in the time of the
Natural and Moysaicall Laws forsook God. Lastly out of some Historiographers
who have written since Christ's time, they scrape together all such testimonies
as s^eme to serve to this purpose in any sort.

19. But they labor in vain. For if these kinds of arguments were good they
would also prove that the Church it self also wholly perished, and was not to
be found in any place, as in times past the Donatists contended, the which even
our Adversaries themselves acknowledge to by very absurd, and against the holy
Scriptures, as has been declared before. For if all have lost their faith,
then indeed the true Church could no longer be, which without faith cannot
consist: and thus the whole Church had perished.

20. But that which they affirm of Ada^ and ^ue, to wit, that they lost their
faith by sinning, is of no moment at all. For to omit that they do not so much
prove by that argument that they lost their faith, then that after their sin
there remained neither any faith, nor Church in the world, it is truly manifest
enough that this belongs nothing to this disputation we now handle. For
neither do we here dispute of the Church of Angels, nor of that which was in
Paradise before the fall of our first parents: but of that only Genesis 3: v. 15.
which ensued that promise made unto all mankind after the sin of Adam,
wherein God foretold that there should be perpetual enmity betwixt the woman
and the serpent, that is to say, betwixt the Church of Christ and Satan. And
wherein also God foretold, that the Church should always have the victory
Supra co^trou. 1. cap 16. 17. and. 18.
over Satan, as we have declared more at large before. Wherefore our Adversaries
must needs show this promise to be frustrate, if they desire to conclude any
thing against us.

21. But those examples which they Supra cap. 5. in solut. 2. argumenti.
allege our of the old Testament are the very arguments of the Donatists, and
other ancient Heretics, who by them went about to prove, that the true Church
was wholly decayed and perished: whereunto we have also sufficiently answered out
of S. Augustine.

22. And lastly those things which they have taken out of those Authors who
wrote after Christ's time, are either corrupted by our Adversaries, or taken out
of Apocriphall Authors, and such as are Baron. in 12. Tom. Annal.
not worthy of credit: as the worthy Cardinal Baronius declares manifestly in
every age, in his Ecclesiastical histories: and the same has Bellarmine done
before Bellarm. l. 3. de Eccles militante.
him more briefly, unto whom we refer the Reader, because they do not
appertain to this present question, but rather unto that which is of the
continual duration of the Church, the which now almost every one does
acknowledge, and Supr. c. 3. and 4. buius Controu.
which we have sufficiently declared before: wherefore these arguments are of
so small worth, that they need no longer a confutation.

CHAP. VIII. That there is no lawful Calling of Preachers, or Pastors of the
Church, but by the visible Church.
ONE of the Offices of the true Church is to appoint lawful preachers of the
Gospel, and true administers of the Sacraments. But because there is no small
Controversy now a days concerning this Office, we will briefly dispatch it.
But to the end that which is in Controversy may the better be understood, here
are three things to be determined. First, that the calling of God is
necessarily required, to the end one may become a lawful preacher, or
administer of the Sacraments. For those words of the Apostle are very clear
and manifest. How shall they ad Romans 10. v. 15. Hebr. 3. v. 4. and 5.
preach, unless they be sent? And again. Neither does any man take the honor
to himself, but he that is cllaed of God, as Aaron. So Christ also did not
glorify himself, that he might be made a high Priest, but he that spoke to
him, My son art Psalm. 2. v. 7.
thou etc. Wherefore he who without this lawful calling and mission dares
presume to intrude himself to meddle with these divine offices, prefers
himself before Christ our Lord. For Christ came not to these offices, but
called and sent by his eternal Father. Lastly, if in humane and worldly
matters none dare meddle with the affairs or busynes of a Prince, without his
license and consent, much less must any deal with these supernatural and
divine offices, unless he be called and sent for that purpose by God himself.

2. The second is, that there are two kinds of callings by God, the one
extraordinary, the other ordinary. The extraordinary calling is when God
immediately by himself calls any, and in this manner God called Moses, and
the other Prophets, and Christ called his Apostles. This is called
extraordinary, because it seldom h^apneth. It is termed also an immediate
vocation, because it is done immediately by God himself. The ordinary vocation
is that which continues always in the Church and is done immediately by the
Pastors of the Church, and of God only by their means. Hereupon also this is
called a mediate vocation, to wit in respect of God. This division is taken out
of S. Paul, who writes himself to be an Apostle, not of men, neither by man
but by Jesus Christ, and God Gal. 11. v. 1.
the Father. For by these words he shows that some which are in the Church
are called to the divine offices by men, and some by God himself.

3. The third is, that those who are taken to Ecclesiastical offices by the
ordinary vocation, they receive their calling and authority from the Church.
For this ordinary vocation is not done but by the ministers of the Church. But
the whole Controversy is of the extraordinary vocation. For those who in this
age have brought in new opinions, seeing themselves destitute of the ordinary
vocation, they fly unto the extraordinary, the which, say they, must not be
subject to the censure, and approbation of the Church, whereof they know
themselves to be destitute. But we on the other side affirm, that the
extraordinary vocation also must necessarily be confirmed and approved by such
as have ordinary vocation in the Church of God. And we know very well, that our
Adversaries have not truly this extraordinary vocation, as afterward we will
declare more at large. But suppose we grant them to have this extraordinary
calling, nevertheless by these ensuing arguments we will manifestly prove,
that it must needs be confirmed and approved by those who have their ordinary
vocation in the Church of God.

4. The first argument. S. Paul was immediately and extraordinarily called by Ad
Galat. 1. v. 1.
God, as he writes himself: and yet he was sent to Ananias who had the
ordinary vocation, that by him he might be instructed and baptized. And
afterward Act. 9. v. 7.
together with S. Barnabas he was ordained by the imposition of hands, by those
who were the ordinary Pastors of the Act. 13. v. 3.
Church. Lastely he writes, that according to the revelation which he had, he
Ibid. v. 1. and 2.
went to Jerusalem, and conserred the Gospel which he preached, with the
visible Church and ordinary Pastor of the same, least he might seem to have
run, or labored in vain: they therefore who refuse the approbation of the
visible Church, albeit they be never so extraordinarily called thereunto, they
do but labor in vain.

5. The second argument. We must not easily believe every one who affirms
himself to be extraordinarily sent by God, according to that admonition of S.
John: Believe not every spirit, but prove the 1. Joan. 4. 4. 1.
spirits whether they be of God, because many false Prophets are gone out into
the world. But this proof or trial cannot be better done then by Christ's
Church, which is, as S. Paul writes, the pillar, and ground of truth. The
which also S. John clearly shows by the words following, when he says, he
that knows God hears us, he that is not of God, hears us not: in this we
know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. It is therefore a most
certain rule whereby this extraordinary vocation is examined, to demand,
whether it will submit it self to the approbation of the visible Church, and
will hear her or no? For he who hears the Church, has the spirit of truth,
and the true extraordinary vocation, but he who will not hear the Church, has
the spirit of error and the false extraordinary vocation.

6. The third argument. The holy Ghost never contradicts himself, for
otherwise (which God forbid) he should not be the spirit of truth, but of
falsehood: for truth is never repugnant to truth, but to falsehood: seeing that
therefore it is manifest that the ordinary vocation is from the holy Ghost, that
extraordinary cannot be opposite unto it, which is truly from the holy Ghost.
For otherwise God should be opposite unto himself, which were impiety to
think; wherefore it necessarily follows, that the extraordinary vocation must
agree with the ordidinary, and be subject unto it; as also it must establish
and confirm, but not impugn it. Hereupon says the Apostle, the spirit of the
Prophets are subject to the 1. ad Cor. 14. v. 32.
Prophets: if they be subject to the Prophets, much more to the whole Church of
Christ.

7. The fourth argument. There would arise a great confusion in the Church of
God, if every one were permitted to preach and administer the Sacraments, that
should affirm himself to be extraordinarily called without any other examine
or approbation of the Church. For so every fantastical fellow might freely
brag and affirm himself to be extraordinarily called by God. And under that
pretense and title might preach, administer the Sacraments and exercise all
other Ecclesiastical offices.

8. By these arguments some more Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 3. sect. 14 Bez. c. 5.
suae confess. ^rtic. 28. Bulling. decad. 5. sermon. 4.
learned amongst our Adversaries being convinced, do acknowledge, that all
extraordinary vocation should be examined and approved by the ordinary Pastors
of Christ's Church. But they add moreover that this is true when the Church it
self follows the word of God, and as long as the ordinary vocation remains
in her. But in vain do they add these conditions, because we have already
proved that the true Church always follows the word of God, nor can depart
or decline in any sort from it. For otherwise Supr. c. praecedent. ad Ephesians. 4.
v. 11. and 13.
she were not the true Church of God, but the Synagogue of Satan. And the
Apostl^ also expressly says, that the ordinary vocation of Pastors and their
continual succession shall remain always in the Church o^ God* until we
meet all with Christ in the end of the world. By which worde^ of the Apostle.
Calvin also and Beza being Calu. and Bez. inea verba ad Ephesians. ^tem Call. l. 4.
Inst. c. 3. sect. 4.
convinced do confess, that there must always be Pastors and Doctors in the
Church of God, and that the said Church cannot consist without them. The same
also their Confession made at Rochell acknowledges in the 25. article.

9. Some of our Adversaries do here object unto us the example of Christ and
his Apostles, for, say they, their doctrine was never approved by the ancient
Church of the Jews, whereas notwithstanding it was extraordinary. But this is a
very friuolus and odious comparison of Christ and his Apostles with their
ministers. For it was expressly foretold by the Prophets, that Christ was to
abrogate the old Law, and the carnal vocation and succession thereof, and that
he was to ordain another more excellent and spiritual, the which he effected
indeed. Wherefore seeing that now the Apostles had another far more excellent
vocation instituted by Christ, there was no reason they should ask any
vocation from Moses. But we read no where that the vocation ordained by Christ
was to be abrogated by any other whosoever: but contrariwise the holy
Scriptures do plainly teach, that the vocation ordained by Christ should
endure till the end of Matt. 28. v. vlt. Ephesians. 4. v. 2. and 13.
the world: wherefore our Adversaries can prove nothing by this argument,
unless they will bring in, and establish another Messiah, and a new Lawmakers,
who has authority to abrogate and change the law and vocation of Christ, which
is the blasphemy of both Turks and Jews.

FINIS.
OF THE GROUND OF FAITH. The second Part of the second Controversy.
CHAP. I. Whether the Church be the foundation and ground of our faith?
IF the pertinacy of our Adversaries were not so great, it were an easy matter
to define this question out of those few words of the Apostle, affirming, that
the Churh is the Pillar and Ground of truth: for seeing that our faith relieth
upon truth (that is to say, upon the most true word of God) and that 1. ad Tim.
3. v. 15.
the Church is the Pillar and Ground of this truth, it must needs follow, that
the Church is the Pillar and Ground of our faith, as afterward we will declare
more at large. But because our Adversaries go about to obscure this great and
renowned praise of our Church, we will treat of this matter more exactly:
especially Cap. 13. seq.. 16.
because this is a question of great importance, seeing that thereon depends
our whole faith. For every thing relyeth and depends of his foundation.
Moreover, hereby is declared the great excellency and authority of the Church.
Hence also other opinions of our faith are to be proved which our Adversaries
deny; their errors confuted, and they themselves very easily convinced. And
that the true state of this Controversy may the better be understood, three
things are to noted.

2. The first is, that every science and doctrine has her grounds and
principles, out of which all other things are deduced, proved, and do depend:
wherefore we must here diligently examine and search out the true principles
of our faith, least otherwise our faith become doubtful and uncertain.

3. The second is, that there are two principles of our faith, the one, that
God is true, and the Author of truth, the other that these things which we
believe are spoken and revealed unto us by God. There is less difficulty of
the former principle. For all who con^e^^e that there is a God, may easily know
even by natural reason, that he is true, or rather the very Truth it self. And
seeing that he is the chiefest good, he can deceive no body, and seeing that he
is Wisdom it self, he Ad Heb. 6. v. 18.
cannot be deceived. Hereupon the Apostle takes this as a principle manifestly
known by it self, It is impossible for God to lie.

4. But the doubts and difficulties which we co^c^yue concerning matters of
faith do especially arise of the second principle, to wit, because we know not
certainly that such things as we believe, are revealed by God: for hence
arises the whole co^trouersy with Jews, Turks, and Heretics. For all do
confess that God is true, but the Turks say, that their Alcora^ was revealed
unto the^ by God, the Jews their Talmud, the Anabaptists their bible,
corrupted and maimed by them; the Anti-trinitarians their blasphemies uttered
against the Blessed Trinity; the Lutherans their opinions, the Caluinists
theirs, and the Catholics theirs. And hence it is, that we need greatly some
sure foundation, principle, rule, and means whereby we may know certainly
which is the doctrine indeed revealed by God, and which is not, otherwise our
faith will always remain doubtful and uncertain.

5. The third is, that God is accustomed three ways to assure his Church of
this his revelation. The first way is, when God himself appears from heaven
and speaks to his Church, for so in times past he spoke unto all the children
of Israel, when he gave them the tables of Exodus 20. v. 22.
his Law in the mount Sinay.

6. The second is, when God speaks to one alone from heaven, and he sends
him to the Church, that he may reveal unto the whole Church such things as God
has spoken unto him. So in times past in the old Testament God spoke by Exodus
24. v. 2. 3. Ad Gal. 2. v. 12.
himself to Moses, and Moses revealed the same things to the people. And in
the new Testament Christ in this manner revealed his Ghosptell to S. Paul,
which he afterward revealed unto others. But these two ways are extraordinary,
and are ceased, as all do confess, excepting only a few Anabaptists, and
Swenkfeldians, whose madness and folly all men disprove.

7. The third way is ordinary, which always remains in the Church, and
whereof the whole controversy is. For almost all Lutherans and the purer sort
of Caluinists will have the sole Scripture to be the foundation and rule,
whereby we may certainly know the true revelation of Call. l 1. Iustit. c. 7.
sect. 1. and 2.
God from the false. But Calu^n himself at the first blush seems to
attribute this to the sole Scripture, and very co^tumeliously inueygheth
against Catholics who deny it, whom therefore he calls brawling and
sacrilegious persons: yet a little after he reduces the principal Call. eode^
c. 7. sect. 4. infine. and sect. 5.
and chiefest certaynty of Scriptures, and of our whole faith, to the
particular and private spirit of every believer. The late Caluinists do put two
grounds or rules of faith, to wit the Scripture, and this private spirit: But
Catholics do teach that neither the Scripture alone is sufficient, nor this
private spirit together with the Scripture, but moreover the spirit, and
authority of the whole and visible Church is necessary. And this is the true
state of of this question.

8. We will therefore explicate four things, that this whole controversy may
more clearly be defined. First, what are the properties and conditions of the
ground of faith, for by these the ground it self will easily be known. For
even as by the properties of a man it may be be known who is a true man, and
by the propirties of any other thing, the thing it self many be known: so by
the properties of the ground of says, the ground it self will be known.
Secondly it shall be proved that the Scripture alone is not a sufficient ground
or rule of faith. Thirdly, that neither any private spirit will suffice.
Fourthly that the authority of the Catholic Church, is the most true ground
and rule of faith.

CHAP. II. The properties of the ground and rule of our faith are alleged.
THERE are ten properties of the ground or rule of faith, and they are so
manifest and certain, that none can doubt thereof. The first is the continual
and never interrupted duration thereof, to the end of the world. For even as
faith and the Church do always endure and continue; so must also the ground of
faith, seeing that nothing can consist without his foundation and ground.

2. The second property is the most certain and undoubted truth thereof, in so
much, that it neither can deceive any, nor be deceived in any thing
appertayning necessarily to salvation, for otherwise it should be uncertain
and doubtful, yea also the faith it self should be false and hurtful unto us.

3. The third property is the certainty thereof on our part. For it is
necessary that the true faith be not only certain in it self, but also to us.
Because error and uncertainty is engendered in us, if the thing be ambiguously
and obscurely proposed, how certain soever it be in it self.

4. The fourth property is, the strength and immutability thereof, so that this
ground can by no means be depraved, changed, or corrupted. For otherwise truth
will sometimes perish, and there will arise some error against faith.

5. The fifth property is the fulness and sufficiency of those things which
are to be believed, that is to say, it must contain all things appertayning to
the Catholic faith, seeing that nothing can consist without his ground or
foundation.

6. The sixth property, is the necessity thereof, that is to say, it must
necessarily be received of all who have the true faith, and because, without it
true faith cannot consist, even as the building cannot continue without the
foundation.

7. The seventh property is, that it is a manifest sign and token, whereby
Christians are distinguished from Infidells. For he which wants the ground
and rule of faith is an Infidel, but he who retayneth it, is a true believer.

8. The eight property is, that in every article and conclusion of faith, this
principle and ground is virtually contained, seeing that out of it all things
are to be deduced, and they receive their certaynty from it.

9. The n^nth property is, that it not only move Christians to believe, but
that it also convince the infidells. For otherwise the way to faith and
eternal salvation, should not be known, or open to Infidels.

10. The tenth property is, that it be contained expressly in the Apostles
Creed, wherein all the first grounds of our faith are contained: for the
Apostles after they had received the holy Ghost, were not so forgetful that in
the Creed or Summary of faith which they set down to be believed of all, they
would let pass the first and chiefest ground of faith. And thus much of the
properties of the ground of faith.

CHAP. III. That the Scripturealone is not the ground, or rule of faith.
THAT the Scripture alone is not the ground of our faith, we have already
declared by the properties of the ground of faith, before alleged. For of
those ten properties the Scripture has only one, to wit, Truth; but all the
other properties are wanting unto it. The which we clearly demo^strate in this
sort. First of all, a perpetual duration, and continuance is wanting. For the
holy Scripture began first under the old Law in Moses time, whereas two
thousand years before, there were both true believers and a Church. In like
manner in the new law the Apostles began to write some years after they had
received the holy Ghost.

2. Secondly, the certaynty on our part Supr. co^tro. 1. c. 5. and infra
hacco^t. 6. cap. 15.
is wanting, seeing that we know not which is the Canonical Scripture by the
Scripture it self, but by the authority of the Church, as we have proved
before, and will also more at large declare hereafter.

3. Thirdly, the foresaid strength and immutability is wanting: for every part
of the holy Scripture considered in it own nature, is subject to many
alterations and falsifications. For it may be destroyed, Supra Controu. 1. cap.
4.
it may be corrupted, it may be wrested to contrary senses, whereof we have
spoken before.

4. Fourthly, that fullness and sufficiency is wanting, because all things
necessary to salvation are not expressy contained Supr. Co^trouers. 1. c. 26.
and sequ^nt.
in holy Scripture, as we have also declared before.

5. Fifthly, the foresaid necessity is wanting. For without the holy Scripture
there were in the law of Nature for the space of two thousand years, many true
belieuers. And also long after Christ, yea even till the time of S. Irenaeus,
that is to say, almost two hundred years, there were many Nations, who
sincerely believed Iren. lib. 3. cap. 4.
in Christ, without any holy Scripture, as S. Irenaeus himself testifies.
Lastly, albeit Infidels should burn all the Bibles, yet the faith of
Christians should not therefore perish, or be wholly overthrown. Therefore our
faith does not necessarily depend of the Scripture.

6. Sixthly, the seventh property is also wanting: for by the holy Scriptures
the true Christians are not distinguished from Infidels, because almost all
Heretics do both now receive the holy Scriptures, and in times past also
received them.

7. Seauenthly, the eight property is wanting, for there are many points of
faith which rely upon the Traditions of Supra Contr. 1. c. 26. and 27.
the Church only, without any express Scripture at all, as we have declared
before.

8. Eighthly, the ninth property is wanting. For Turks and other Gentills who
are only lead by natural reason, are very seldom or never converted by
Scriptures only: but we add also some other natural reasons and perwasions
that they may be converted. For there are many things in holy Scripture which
seem opposite to natural reason, as the mysteryes of the Blessed Trinity,
Incarnation, and Resurrection of the dead etc.

9. Ninthly, there wants last of all the tenth property, for there is nothing
extant of the Scripture in the Apostles Creed.

10. The holy Scripture indeed is the ground, and reason why we believe many
points of faith, but not the ground why we believe all. Moreover neither is it
the first ground of all that we believe by it. For the Scripture it self is
proved by some other more general ground, to wit, by the authority of the
Church, Wherefore the Scripture is only a particular ground, and not a
general: a mediate, and not immediate: a secondary, and not the first, and
chiefest rule of faith.

CHAP. IIII. That the private or particular spirit of every one, is not the
ground or rule of faith.
THAT no private spirit of any can be the ground of our Faith, is far more
evident by the same properties now alleged. For none of these ten properties
does agree with the private spirit of every one that belieueth, the which we
declare by these arguments.

1. First there wants the foresaid continuance. For there is no private or
particular person, who has continued from the beginning of the world, or shall
endure till the end thereof, as faith has continued.

2. Secondly, there wants truth, because there is no private man to be found
which cannot err and be deceived, for as witnesses the Apostle, Every man is
Romans 3. v. 4.
a liar.

3. Thirdly, there wants certainty in proposing matters of faith unto us,
because none can be certain that any private person can have such a spirit,
yea eue^ in our Adversaries judgments. For the predestinate only in their
opinion have this spirit, even as they only in their judgments have the true
faith: but the predestinate are known to none but only to God, according to
that of the Apostle, God knows who are his: The which Calvin 2. Tim. 2 v. 19.
Call. l. 4. Inst. c. 1. sect. 2.
expressly teaches.

4. Fourthly, the foresaid strength and immutability is wanting, for that a
private man has not that strength and immutability of his doctrine. Our
Adversaries themselves confess, and experience teaches us, that they often
times change their interpretations of Scriptures, and at diverse times they
teach plain contraries; yea they confess, that this their private spirit is
not permane^t with them, but often times leaves and forsakes them; the which
they prove out of that place of the 29. or 30. Psalm, the eight verse: Thou
have turned thy face from me, and I became Vid disp. Paris. an. 1566. in disp.
1. di^i sub finem.
troubled. For thus they affirmed in that famous disputation had at Paris, Anno
1566.

5. Fifthly, there wants that fullness and sufficiency, because no private man
can define all points of faith: seeing that many were defined before he was
borne against the ancient heretics, and there will be many things defined in the
Church after his death, as soon as there shall arise any new heresies.

6. Sixthly, there wants necessity. For before there was any private man which
now lives, there was true faith, and the same faith will continue after he is
dead.

7. Seauenthly, there wants the seventh property of the rule of faith, seeing
that by this private spirit a Christian cannot be distinguished from an
Infidel. But in truth all heretics do brag, and boast that they have this
private spirit, whereas notwithstanding one condemns or rather damneth another.

8. Eighthly, there wants the eight property. For no point of faith can be
certainly deduced out of this private spirit only, seeing that it is oftentimes
uncertain and deceitful.

9. Ninthly, there wants the ninth property. For it is a ridiculous thing for
one to endeavor to convert an infidel to the faith, by bragging only that he
has this private spirit, the which none can either see or understand.

10. Tenthly, there wants the tenth and last property, because there is no
mention made of this private and particular spirit in the Apostles Creed.

11. And the true spirit of faith which is in every faithful soul, whereof the
Apostle speaks when he says, that we have the spirit of says, is not the 2.
Cor. 4. v. 13.
ground or reason of faith we here speak of, but it is the help of God, or
the supernatural gift of faith, whereby our understanding is helped to
believe, and it is in regard of our understanding, as it were the efficie^t
cause of the acts of faith. But we speak in this place of the formal cause,
or reason of faith, as it appertains to the object of Faith which is the word
of God, and by which we know what is the true revealed word of God, and what is
not. For albeit the holy Ghost and the gift of faith move us to believe, yet
they do not rashly move us without any reason or ground. Eccles. 19. v. 4.
For he as the wise man says, who belieueth quickly is light of heart, but
with a solid and sure ground, according to those words of 1. Joan. 4. v. 1.
S. John: do not (dearly beloved) believe every spirit, but prove the spirits
whether they be of God. But this proof, and trial necessarily requires some
good reason and sure ground, whereof we will speak in the next Chapter.

12. Lastly it is to be considered, that we do here dis^ute of the Catholic
faith as it is necessary to al to attain their eternal salvation, and not of
the special faith of one or other, the which we know very well may arise or
proceed from some particular or extraordinary revelation of God: but this is
not the Catholic faith, not an ordinary, but an extraordinary faith, not to be
admitted generally of all, till it be approved and received by the Church, as
presently we will declare more at large.

CHAP. V. That the Catholic Church is the ground, or rule of our Faith.
THAT the Catholic and visible Church is the most solid and true ground of
our faith, is manifestly proved by the former properties of the Ground of
faith. For all those ten properties do very well agree to the Church, and to
nothing else besides. The Church has the first property, to wit, a continual
and neuer-interrupted Sup^. cap. 3. huius Controu.
duration. For the Church has always continued, as we have already proved
even by the testimony of our Adversaries.

2. The Church also has the second property, that is to say, a most certain
Supr. cap. 7. huius Controu.
and undoubted truth, because she can never err in faith, as we have proved
before.

3. She has also the third property, that is to say, the infallible certainty
on our parts, because in the doctrine of the Church, we may have the greatest
certainty, perspicuity, and euidency that possibly we can desire. Seeing that
the Church is always present, who explicateth always her m^nd unto us in
plain and manifest words. And if at any time there arise any doubt or
Controversy in her dec^e^s, she presently declares it, no otherwise then it
the Prophets and other writers of the old and new Testament were yet alive,
and would clearly explicate their mynds unto us in their own proper words. For
it is the same Holy Ghost who in times past spoke by the mouth of the Prophets
and Apostles, Matt. 10. v. 20.
and who speaks now by the mouth of the Church: ^or it is not you that
speak, but the spirit of your Father that speaks in you.

4. The Church has the fourth property. For there is exceeding great strength
and immutability in the doctrine of the Church. For this truly can never be
corrupted, falsified, or changed, because the Church is always present, who
always gives most clear and evident testimony of her own doctrine. This
doctrine also of the Church remains always constant and immovable, because
the holy Ghost is always present who will not permit the Church to err,
according to those words of Christ: I will Joan. 14. v. 16.
ask my Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may remain
everlastingly with you.

5. The Church has the fifth property, that is to say, the fullness and
sufficiency of doctrine. For the Church teaches all things necessary to
salvation, according to that promise of Christ: When the spirit of truth shall
come, he will teach you all truth. So that the Joan. 16. v. 13.
Church has hitherto condemned all heresies, and hereafter also will condemn
all errors arising and oppugning the Catholic faith. In like manner she
always answers to all doubts and difficulties. proposed unto her, because
she is always present and always lives.

6. The Church has also the sixth property, that is to say, Necessity. For no
doctrine must be received as a point of faith, unless it be received and
approved Suprac. 8. huius Controu. Gal. 1. v. 12.
by the Church, as we have declared before by the example of S. Paul, who
although he received his Gospel immediately from God by the revelation of
Christ, yet he was commanded by revelation to go the visible Church, and to
confer the Gospel which he preached with those who were in the visible
Church, least perhaps in vain he should run, or had run.

7. Yea, and others could not safely believe him unless his doctrine had been
approved by the Church, as Tertulli^n, S. Hierome, and S. Augustine well note.
The Apostle S. Paul (says S. Augustine) called from heaven, if he had not
found the Apostles with whom by conserring his Gospel he might appear to be
of the same Society, the Church would not at all believe him. Thus S.
Augustine. And much more the Ghospells of S. Mark, and S. Luke, who were not
Apostles, but only their disciples, stood in need of this approbation of the
Church. Hereupon says Tertullian, If he from whom S. Luke received Tertul. l.
4. contra Marci. c. 2. S. Hier. Ep. 11. S. Aug. tom. 6. cont. Faustum Manich.
l. 28. c. 4. Tert. loco cita. Gal. 2. v. 2.
his light, desired to have his faith and preaching authorized by his
predecessors; how much more reason have I to desire the like for the Gospel
of S. Luke, seeing the same was so necessary for the Gospel of his Master?
Thus far Tertullian.

8. And hence it is, that the revelations of S. Brigit, and S. Catherine of
Siena, albeit they were truly revealed unto them by God, yet they do not
appertain to the Catholic faith, because they are not approved by the Church,
as the undoubted and certain word of God.

9. Even as also in the Apostles time many before S. Luke wrote the acts of
Christ, as S. Luke himself testifyeth, and yet notwithstanding the Ghospells
only of Luc. 1. v. 1.
two of them, to wit S. Matthew, and S. Mark, are authentical, for it is well
known that S. John wrote his Gospel long after S. Luke: but the Ghospells of
the rest who wrote before S. Luke do not appertain unto faith, because they
were never approved by the Church. Whereby it sufficiently appears, how
necessary the approbatio^ and authority of the Church is.

10. The Church has the seventh property of the ground of faith, for by the
Church and her conjunction and communion, a true belieuer may be distinguished
from an Infidel: for he who belieueth the Church and hears her, is a true
belieuer, but he who does not hear her, is an Infidel: if he will not hear
the Matt. 18. v 17. 1. Ioa^. 4. v. 6.
Church, says our Lord, let him be unto thee as an heathe^or publica^. And S.
John says: he which knows God hears us, he which is not of God, does not
hear us.

11. The Church has the eight property. For whatsoever we believe with our
Catholic faith, we believe it because it is revealed unto us from God by Calu.
l. 4. Instit. c. 9. sect. 1. and Beza c. 4. suae confess. sect. 17.
the Church. But God now reuealeth nothing to every member of the Church
immediately by himself. Yea even our Adversaries do well admonish us to labor
most of all, that no way, or leave be granted to such fantastical revelations.

12. The Church* has the ninth property. For the Church conuinceth also Turks
and Infidels by natural reasons, of which sort there are many extant in S. S.
Thom. in 4 lib. contra Gentes, insracap. 19. huius Controu.
Thomas. We prove also the Church by the very signs and marks of the Church,
which are manifest unto all, even Turks and Infidels, whereof we will speak
more hereafter.

12. The Church has also the tenth property, because in the Apostles Creed
there is expressed an article of the Church: For presently after the faith of
the true God, the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost, first of al is set
down this article, I believe the holy Catholic Church,

14. Moreover that the Church and her preaching is the ground of faith,
evidently appears by the words of holy Scripture. For when S. Paul disputes
of that faith whereby all are to to be saved, he reduces this whole Faith to
the preaching of the Church, and unto her sending and calling of others to her
Ecclesiastical offices.

15. So this Apostle in another place declares, that God always appointed
some Pastors Romans 10. v 14. and seq.
and Doctors in his Church, that we be not children, wavering in faith, and
carried about with every wynd of doctrine but that we may be stable and
constant always in one and the same faith, and confession of the Son of God.

16. Lastly those words of S. Paul are most evident, wherein he affirms, that
the Church is the pillar and ground of 1. Tim. 3. ^. 15.
truth. Where we are to consider, that every foundation of any bulding has two
offices, that is to say, to vphould the house, and to strengthen it. The
Apostle here attributes the^ both to the Church, the one, when he calls her
the pillar of truth, the other when ^^ calls her the ground of the same
truth. For the pillar also of the earth according to the Hebrew Job. ^. v. 6.
Psalm. 74. vel inxta Hebr^os 79. v. 4.
phrase* does signify the lowest fou^dations of the earth. So God is said to
shake the pillars of the earth, and elsewhere to strengthen the pillars of the
earth, that is to say, the very foundations thereof.

17. These so manifest and perspicuous Calu. in^. ad Tim. 3. v. 15.
words of the Apostle do compel Calvin at the last to be of our opinion;
albeit after his accustomed manner at the first, he wrongfully slaundereth us,
affirming that Catholics hold, or to use his own words, do blab out this
horrible blasphemy, that is to say, that the truth of God is not strong enough,
unless it be vphoulden by the shoulders of men, and that the word of God is
uncertain, till by humble prayers, as it were, it borrows some certaymy from
men. And afterward he affirms that the Apostle in this place would nothing
else, but that the truth of God is supported by the pure preaching of the
Gospel. But that which he said first is a mere slander, for we do not say,
that the truth or the word of God absolutely, and considered precisely in it
self, receives it certainty and strength from the Church, for in this sense
it receives a most perfect strength and large authority from God himself: but
in regard of men and in consideration of our knowledge, it receives it
certainty from the Church, Infra hac Controu. cap. 16. in fine.
as afterward we will declare more at large: the which also Calvin in the words
immediately following, acknowledges to be most true, when he writes in this
Calu. loco citato. Romans 10. v 17.
sort: S. Paul simply understands (says Calvin) that which in other words
he says in the tenth Chapter to the Romans, because faith is by hearing, there
will be no faith, unless there he some that preach. Therefore in regard of men,
the Church supporteth the truth, because it makes it famous by her praise and
commendation, because the retayneth it in sincerity and purity, and because the
delivers and sendoth it to her posterity. Thus Calvin.

18. But that which secondly he adds, that the truth of God is supported and
vpholden by the pure preaching of the Church, is indeed most true: but he
should have considered that this pure preaching of the Gospel cannot be found
but only in the Church, and that no others but men can preach the pure
Gospel. Wherefore if the truth of God be sustained by the pure preaching of
the Gospel, it necessarily follows also, that the Church must be sustained
by men, and consequently that the Church of Christ is the gound of truth,
albeit not absolutely, yet in regard of us and our Beza in 1. ad Tim. 3. v. 15.
knowledge. So as Beza also is forced to confess the same, ex^licating those
words of the Apostle, the pillar and ground of truth: Understand this, says
Beza, not simply in it self but in regard of us. Thus he.

19. It is therefore manifest as well out of Calvin as Beza, that the Church in
regard of us is the ground of truth, or of the word of God, and consequently of
our faith which relyeth thereon. But that which in regard of men is the ground
of our faith, that is the true ground thereof, because our faith cannot well,
nor must not be considered but in regard of men, seeing that our faith cannot
be found but in men only: if therefore in regard of men the Church be the ground
of truth, it is also most truly and necessarily the ground of our faith.

20. Furthermore, that the ancient Church of the holy Fathers did constantly
hold the preaching and authority of the Catholic Church to be the ground of
our faith, those excellent words of S. Augustine do manifestly declare, when he
S. Aug. Tom. 6. contra Epist. Manich. cap. 5. Calu. l. 1. Instit. sect. 3.
writes thus, disputing against the Maniches. I, says he, would not believe
the Gospel, but that the authority of the Catholic Church moved me thereunto:
this se^te^ce of S. Augustine vexes our Adversaries very much. Calvin goes
about to persuade the ignorant people, that S. Augustine speaks of himself
yet remaining a Manichean Heretic, and not of himself as being converted and
made a Catholic. But this is a ridiculous evasion, for the words which follow
a little after do show, that this is a false interpretation of Calvin, If thou
do hold thy self to the Gospel (S. Augustine speaks unto a Manichean
heretic) I would hold my self to those, by whose commandment I beliued the
Gospel. He speaks therefore of himself, as now being a Catholic: and after
a few words. Whose authority, says he, being infringed and weakened, I could
not now even believe the Ghospel it self. Where he shows plainly that our
faith does so depend of the authority of the Church, that it being weakened or
taken a way, it could not remain or continue by any faith of the Gospel.
Whereby it is manifest, that it is false which Iunius writes, that S. Augustine
did only speak of the accidentary and not of the necessary cause.

21. Others say, that S. Augustine did speak of this, or that book of the
Gospel, and not of the whole Gospel in general: but the very words of S.
Augustine do teach the contrary, because he speaks every where of the
Gospel it self in general. Moreover one and the same reason is of one book
of the Gospel, and of all the rest, as concerning faith.

22. Others lastly do answer, that S. Augustine did not speak of the Church
of his time, but of the primitive Church wherein were the Apostles who approved
the Gospel. But this solution is also easily refuted out of the words next
following: to whom, says S. Augustine, I have obeyed, saying, Believe the
Gospel, why should I not obey them then, saying unto me, Do not believe
Manicheus? But it is manifest that the primitive Church spoke nothing of
Manicheus, but that Church only which was in S. Augustines time said unto him,
do not believe Manicheus. For Manicheus lived many years 8. Aug. Tom. 6.
contra Faustu^ l. 13. c. 4.
after the primitive Church, yea even after S. Cyprian, that is to say, almost
three hundred years after Christ, as the same S. Augustine testifyeth, and it
is otherwise sufficiently well known that the Manichean heresy was unknown in
the world before the year 277. See Baronius in his 2. Tome, in the year 277.
in the 2. number and others following.

CHAP. VI. The Arguments of our Adversaries are confuted.
NOW it remains we answer to the arguments of our Adversaries, for by our
answers the difficulty of this whose controversy will be more perspicuously
resolved. Their first argument is, if the authority of the Church were the
ground of faith, then it would follow, that our faith relied upon men, and not
upon God, for the Church consists of men. Our Adversaries do often repeat
and inculcate this argument unto us. I answeere, that the same argument, if it
were any thing worth, would also prove that we should not believe Scriptures,
because althose who wrote the books of the Bibles were also men; bu^^^ we do
believe their writings not because they were men, but because they had a
certain peculiar assistance of the holy Ghost who did so govern and direct
them that they could not err: so in like manner we believe the Church, and
make it the ground of our faith, not as it consists of men, but as it has a
special and continual assistance of the holy Ghost, by whom she is
continually governed and directed: whereby it comes to pass that she can
never err, as we have proved Cap. 7. praeced.
a little before.

2. Wherefore to make the Church the ground of our faith is nothing else then to
make the holy Ghost and Christ himself the ground thereof. For it is he who
speaks unto us by the mouth of the Church according to that saying of S.
Paul: Seek you an experiment of him that speaks in me, Christ? And in
another place speaking of his own 2. Cor. 13. v. 3. 1 Thessalonians. v. 8.
doctrine he says: therefore he that despises these things, despises not man
but God, who also has given his holy spirit in us. But our Adversaries do
think and speak too basely of the Church, as though it consisted of men only,
as the Churches of Infidells and Heretics, seeing that the chief part of the
true Church of Christ is the holy Ghost, who is as it were the soul and spirit
of the Church.

3. But neither is this to make the Scripture or the holy Ghost subject and
inferito our men (as our Adversaries are wo^t to cauil) but only to show, that
the holy Ghost is every where conformable to himself, and that in all things he
never differs or disagreeth from himself: Whether he speak unto us by the
holy Scripture, or by the mouth of the Church, as Calvin acknowledges, Calu.
l. 1. Instit. c. 9. sect. 2.
disputing against the Anabaptists and Libertines, who by such an argument went
about to reject the holy Scriptures, to wit, least the holy Ghost might be made
subject, and inferior unto them.

4. The second argument is, that Christians may and ought to judge and examine
all things, as the Apostle says, therefore the spirit of every Christian ought
to be the ground of al things. I answer, that by the same argument, the
Anabaptists and Libertines 1. Cor. v. 15.
reiect^d all the Scriptures, that they might only retain the spirit, as
witnesses Calvin, but badly: for even as Christians must discern and judge
all things, so must Cal^^. c. 9. citat sect. 1.
they also observe the rule and method in judging, which the Scripture does
prescribe unto them, and which himself appointed; but this rule is not every
ones private spirit, but the spirit of the whole Church. For it is altogether
necessary that the rule of faith be most certain and free from all errors, as
the spirit of the whole Church is, and not that of every private man. Hereupon
says S. John, He 1. Joan. 4. v. 6.
which knows God, hears us, he who is not of God, does not hear us: in
this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. We must t^erfore
judge of every man, by that they either hear or do not hear the Church, etc
because they either agree or disagree from the spirit of the Catholic Church.

5. The third argument is, that Catholics prove the Church and the authority
thereof by the Scripture, therefore Scripture is rather the ground of faith then
the Church. I answer first, that the proof of the Church which is taken out
of Scriptures, when we dispute against heretics, is an argument called by
Philosophers ad hominem, and it is deduced out of the premises already
granted, in which manner also the first principles or grounds of every science
may be proved, and out of those things also which of themselves are not very
strong and certain. So out of the old Testament against the Jews we prove the
new Testament, albeit this also is the ground of our faith: because the Jews
do admit and receive the old Testament but not the new, yea also even out of
the Jewish Talmud we prove many things against the Jews, because they admit
and approve it as the word of God, but yet their Talmud is not the ground of
our faith, because this only is, as I said, an argument deduced out of such
things as they gra^^t unto us. So in like ma^^er because almost al heretics
admit the Scripture, and reject the authority of the Church, therefore when we
dispute against them, we prove the authority of the Church by the Scriptures,
as premises already granted by them. But if we were to deal with Infidells
or others who do not admit the Scriptures, then the said Scriptures were to be
proved by the authority of the Church and not contrariwise. For it is a thing
far better and more commonly known, that there Infra 18. buius co^* ^r.. 10.
is a Church, then that there are the holy Scriptures, as afterward we will
show more clearly.

6. Secondly I answer, that there is so great connection betwixt the Scripture
and the Church, that the Scripture may very well be proved by the authority of
the Church, and again the church by the authority of the Scripture. Neither
should this seem strange to our Adversaries. For Logicians also know very well
that, that which by it own nature is more certain and better known, may be
proved by that which is more certain and beter known unto us, by a
demonstration, called by them a posteriori. And contrary wise that which is
better known unto us, may be proved by that which is better known and more
certain in his own nature, by a demonstration called a priori. So the cause
is proved by the effect and the effect by the cause; as fire is proved by heat
a posteriori, and heat by the nature of fire a priori. So in like manner by
the authority of the Church, the which in regard of us, is more certain and
better known, we prove the Scripture, as it were a posteriori, and by the
authority of the Scripture, which in it own nature is more certain, we prove
the true Church of Christ, as it were a priori.

7. The fourth argument. S. Paul testifyeth, that the Church is supported by
the ground and foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, that is to say, by
their Prophetical and Apostolical doctrine, but if the foresaid doctrine be
the ground of the Church, it necessarily follows that this doctriue appears
to be certain in it self, before the Church began to be. The Church therefore
must be that which gives certainty to the doctrine or writings of the
Apostles, but rather their doctrine and writings do affoard sufficient
certainty to the Church. So Calvin. Calu. lib. 1. ^nst. c. 7 sect. 2. Beza in
2. cap. ad Ephesians. v. 10.
I answer first, if we will follow the interpretation of this place alleged
by Beza, Caluins argument will be nothing worth. For Beza will have this to be
the sense of those words, that the Church is built upon Christ who is the
ground and foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and he will have only
Christ to be the groundworke, and the Apostles and Prophets he says, were only
as the Architects and builders of this Church, as also all faithful Ministers
of Christ are at this day, but not the ground it self. Beza also adds, that
he is truly Antichrist, who attributes that unto himself which belongs only
to Christ, that is to say, to be the ground and foundation of the Church.

8. Out of which doctrine of Beza it follows manifestly, that Calvin is truly
Antichrist. For he attributes unto all Ministers of the Church, and to their
doctrine, and consequently unto himself and his own doctrine, that they are
the foundation of the Church, but according to Beza, whosoever attributes this
unto himself is plainly Antichrist, because he attributes that unto himself
which only belongs unto Christ.

9. Secondly I answer, that yet whatsoever Beza says, Caluins exposition is
the trewer, agreeing therein with S. Chrrsostome, S. Chrysostom. Hom. 6. inc. 2. ad
Ephesians. S. Aug. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 86. adv. 1. Theoph. in e. 2. Ephesians.
S. Augustine, Theophilact, and other ancient Fathers, that is to say, that S.
Paul in this place calls the Apostles and Prophets, the ground and foundation
of faith, or that which is alone, their doctrine: for in the sameplace he
compares Christ to the chiese corner stone, and the foundation of this
spiritual building does consist of many stones, but there is one lowest and
chiefest, to wit, Christ Jesus, who supporteth all, and who is that corner
stone which unites Ephesians. 2. v. 14.
the Jews and Gentills together, as S. Paul says in the same Chapter.

10. Hence it is that S. John in the Apocalypse affitmeth that this heauently
Apoc. 2^ v. 14.
City has twelve foundations and not only one, and Christ notwithstanding is
S. Aug. Tom 8. in Psalm. 86. initio.
the chiefest of all the foundations, and the foundation of foundations, as S.
Augustine says, that is to say, of all those twelve foundations he is the
foundation.

11: And here the Apostle uses the Hebrew phrase in which it is all one to
say, Upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and to say, Upon the
Apostolical and Prophetical foundation. For the Hebrews Psalm. 5. v. 7.
often use the Genitive case of the substantive for the adjective, as a man of
blood and deceit, in the fifth Psalm signifies, a blouby and deceitful man.

12. Furthermore, that which Calvin says that the Apostolical and
Prophetical doctrine has it certainty of it self before the approbation of
the Church; that indeed is true, but this is the certainty which it has of it
own nature from Cap. 13. praecedent.. 17. and. 19.
God himself, but in regard of us it receives it certainty from the Church,
as Calvin and Bez^ witness, and as we have already declared.

13. But Calvin erreth in this, that he thinks S. Paul to treat in this
place of the Scripture, only of the Apostles and Prophets. For not only the
Apostolical Scripture is the ground of our faith, but all the doctrine of the
Apostles. And few of the twelve Apostles, to wit, only five, have written any
thing, but of the other seven, there are no writings extant, but yet they all
taught; the Apostle therefore speaks of the Apostolical doctrine and only of
the Scripture.

14. But neither do we deny that faith depends of the Apostles doctrine, yea
more then that we say, that our faith depends of the doctrine of the present
Church. For when we affirm that the Church is the ground of our faith, we ad
Romans 10. v. 17.
do not understand by the Church, the shoulders or bodies of them who are in
her, but their authority, doctrine and preaching; for by these things faith is
engendered, and as the Apostle witnesses, faith is by hearing.

15. But whenever we treat of the true Church of Christ, we do not speak of
that which wants true faith, which is deaf, dumb, or foolish, and which
also either neglects, or not understands the Word of God or Scriptures, for
such a Church is not the true Church of Christ. But we speak of that which
belieueth, which speaks, which preaches the pure word of God, which keeps
and expounds the Scriptures most faithfully, and which fit^ly applies them
in Sermons and Exho^tations. Among us therefore all these words have one and
the same signification, the Church, the faith of the Church, the preaching and
doctrine of the Church, the word of God preached by the Church, and the truth
of God proposed unto us by the Church. And we understand all these things by
the Name of the Church* when we say, that she is the ground of our faith. For
all these things are either properties, actions, or offices of the Church
which cannot be separated from her.

16. Wherefore our Adversaries do err exceedingly when they separate every
one of these from the Church. and oppose or object it against her as though it
were a quite distinct thing from her, nay of the true Church of Christ they
make her the Sinagogue of Satan. Therefore the Apostolical and Prophetical
doctrine must not be separated and made opposite unto the Church, as Calvin
does, seeing that it is an essential part of the visible Church. Calvin
therefore disputes as if one should make this argument: A man without his soul
neither sees, speaks, nor understands; therefore a man neither sees,
speaks, nor understands.

17. But peradventure some will say, We have said a little before, that faith
is the ground of the Church, and now we say, that the Church is the ground of
faith, whereof the one seems to be contrary to the other. I answer, that
heerin there is no contrariety. For there be two kinds of faith, the one is
the particular faith of every Christian, whereby together with hope and
charity, every one is justified, the other is the general and common faith of
the whole Church. The particular faith of each one relyeth upon the Church, to
wit, upon the faith, preaching, and authority of the whole Church. But she her
self relieth upon the general faith and profession, and preaching thereof in
the whole Church, which is an essential part of the visible Church. When
therefore we say, that the Church is the ground of faith, we speak of the
particular faith of every Christian. But when we say, that faith is the ground
of the Church, we speak of the general faith of the whole Church.

19. There are other arguments of our Adversaries, but we may easily answer
Canus l. 2. de ^ocis Theol. c. 8. Bellar. l 3. deverbo Dei c. vlt.
thereunto by that which has been already said, the which Mel^hior Canus, and
Bellarmine do prosecute, and handle more at large, unto whom we refer the
Reader. For they are borrowed of the Anabaptists and Libertines, whereby the
authority of the holy Scriptures themselves is no less diminished and
infringed then that of the Church.

CHAP. VII. That the Church does not only give a bare testimony, but also
authority to the Scripture.
THIS matter is here briefly to be examined, that it may more clearly be
understood how necessary the Churches approbation is, to the establishing of
the authority of the holy Scriptures. But to the end that it may more clearly
appear whereof we dispute in this place, it is to be considered, that seeing
that our Adversaries cannot deny, but that the Church a^^oardeth some testimony
to the holy Scriptures, they affime, that this testimony of the Church is only
a bare testimony, and not a testimony of authority.

2. For there are two kinds of testimonies. The one is called a testimony of
authority, because upon it, the truth of the things testified depends. Yt is
called also a necessary testimony, because without it the thing in question is
not sufficiently testified. The other is called a bare testimony and not
necessary, that is to say, when such a testimony is not so necessary, because
the matter is otherwise Joan. 1. v. 7.
sufficiently testified. Such a testimony was that, which S. Sohn Baptist g^ue
of Christ. For Christ had sufficient testimonies besides.

3. Of the former testimony of authority, Christ says: But I do not receive my
Joan. 5. v. 34. and 36. Ibid.
testimony from men, to wit, the testimony of authority and necessary. For of
the bare testimony he had spoken a little before. You sent unto John, and he
has given testimony to truth. But this was a bare testimony: wherefore Christ a
little after said, I have a greater testimony then John, for the works which
the Father has given me to profit them: the very works which I do, give
testimony of me, that the Father has sent me. And the Father that sent me,
himself has given testimony of me. All which says. Christ of the testimony
of authority. Our Adversaries therefore say, that the Church gives only a bare
testimony to the Scriptures, as S. John gave to Christ, but she gives not a
necessary testimony or that of authority.

4. But that the testimony of the Church, is altogether necessary, as that
Matt. 3. v. vlt. Matt. 17. v. 5.
whereof the authority of the Scriptures depends, is very manifest by that
which is said in the former Chapter. And by that also which we alleged in the
first disputation, where we show, that there is now no firm testimony whereby
we may know certainly, which book is canonical and which not, besides the
testimoniy of the Catholic Church. For now neither are the miracles wrought
which God did in times past, neither does God speak immediately by himself, as
he spoke in the baptism and transfiguration of Christ. Wherefore there
remains only the third ordinary manner, whereby God speaks by the mouth of
the Church. The Church therefore does not give a bare testimony only to the holy
Scriptures, but the testimony of authority, to wit, that whereof the authority
of the Scriptures depends, as concerning us and our knowledge.

5. Moreover if the doctrine of S. Paul stood in need of the Churches
approbation, as we have already proved out of Supr. c. 3.. 13. huius Controu.
the Scriptures, much more S. Lukes Gospel who was only S. Paul's! choler
stood in need thereof, as Tertullian witnesses, especially because S. Luke
received not those things which he wrote by revelation from God, Tertu. l. 4.
contra Mar^^. 2. Luc. ^. v. 2.
as S. Paul did, but by tradition from others, as he himself writes. And the
same also may be said of S. Mark, whose Gospel, as S. Hierome writes, the
Apostle S. Peter approved, and by his authority he commanded it should be read
in the Church.

6. But neither is it true that some say, that the authority of approving the
Canonical books was only resident in the Apostles and the primitive Church;
but the ensuing Church has it not. For the Apostles did not approve all the
Canonical books of the new Testament. For if they had done so, there had
remained no doubt of many of them for many ages after the death of the
Apostles, even among Catholic good men, as we Supra ca. 5. Contr. 1.
have noted before: But many years after the Apostles time by the general
Counsels and Decrees of the Church, some books were approved, whereof there
was before some doubt.

7. Yea more then six hundred years after Christ, there were many Catholics
who did not receive the authority of the Toletan. Council. c. 16.
Apocalypse, as appears out of the fourth Toletane Council.

8. And that which is more, before the Council of Trent, there were many
Catholics who thought that it was lawful for them to doubt of all the books
of the new Testament, the which in times past S. Hierome seemed to judge as
doubtful; as are the Epistles of S. James, the second of S. Peter, the second
and third of S. John, the Epistles of S. Jude, the Epistles to the Hebrews,
and the Apocalypse. And if it had not been for the Council of Tre^t, or some
other new Decree of the Church, none would as yet condemn them as Heretics,
who called those books in question.

9. By that which has been said it appears manifestly, that the Canonical
Scriptures receive their strength and authority, not from the approbation of
the primitive Church, but rather from the approbation of the Church succeeding;
yea even of this present Church, to wit, of the Council of Trent.

10 Lastly, albeit the present Church should not have the authority of
approving Scriptures, as these men say, yet notwithstanding for three other
reasons the authority and testimony of this present Church is necessary. First,
because we know not certainly what books the primitive Church has either
written, or not written, approved or rejected, but by the testimony of the
present Church. Secondly, neither do we know whether those books came
uncorrupted unto us or no, but by the same testimony. Thirdly, because we
cannot otherwise know which is the true sense of those books.

CHAP. VIII. The Arguments of our Adversaries are confuted.
THE first argument of our Adversaries is: The Church is grounded upon the word
of God; and by the word also of God ^t is engendered, nourished, and governed,
and it is subject to the word of God as to the words of her spouse. I answer,
our Adversaries do in a manner confound the written word of God, with the word
of God in general, the which they should not do: for there are three sorts of
the word of God to wit, that which is believed, preached, and written. The
believed word is in the heart of the Church, that which is preached is in her
mouth, and that which is written is in her books. Of the believed and preached
Word, the Apostle says: the word is in thy mouth, and in thy heart, this is the
word of faith which we preach. We Romans 20. v. 8.
confess, that in the believed and preached word the Church is founded,
because by the same it is engendered, nourished, Romans 10. v. 10. Ibid. v. 14.
and governed, and that unto this word it is subject and obedient, as unto the
Words of her spouse. For indeed this kind of word is necessary for the Church.
For with our heart (says the Apostle) we believe unto Justice, but with the
mouth confession is made to salvation. And again: How shall they hear without
a preacher?

2. But the nature of the written word is far different; for this is neither
altogether necessary for the Church, seeing that the Church was without it
more then two thousand years; neither can the written word be profitable to
the Church, unless it be also rightly preached, and believed. For what does it
profit a man to have the Bible, unless he rightly believe and understand it?

3. But the Scripture whereof we now dispute, does only conteyne the written
word, but the believed and preached word is contained in the visible Church, as
the necessary and essential parts thereof: seeing the one is as it were the life
in the heart of the Church, the other as it were the speech in her mouth:
neither can they ever be separated from her, according to that saying and
promise of God: The words which I have put in thy mouth shall not Isa. 59. v.
vlt.
depart from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, nor from the mouth of
thy seeds seed, from henceforth for evermore.

4. Wherefore this argument does prove the quite contrary, for seeing that the
written word receives it profit and authority from the rightly believed and
preached word, which are the parts of the Church; it is necessary, that the
written word receive that authority and vtility from the Church, as that,
wherein only the word rightly preached and believed is to be found.

5. The second argument: If the Church should teach any thing contrary to the
Scriptures we were not to believe the Church. Therefore the Scripture does not
receive that authority from the Church, but rather the Church from the
Scripture. I answer, that in the same manner it may be said, that if the
Scripture should contain any thing against truth, we should not also believe
it; if the holy Ghost should utter and speak any lie, we should not believe
him. But th^se conditions are indeed impossible, and blasphemous against God;
wherefore they are not only to be admitted, but not even to be proposed of
Christians. For it is impossible that the Church should teach any thing
contrary to the Scriptures, for then the holy Ghost should lie, because he
should teach one thing by the Church, and the contrary by the Scriptures.

6. The third argument, if the Scripture receive that authority from the
Church, then the Church should be above the Scripture: which seems to be very
absurd. I answer. That the Church is above the Scriptures, may be understood
two ways. First, because the Church exceeds the Scripture in dignity and
excellency, and in this sense, without all doubt, the Church is about the
Scripture, for the Scripture is made for the Church, and not contrary wise. All
things (says the Apostles) 1. Cor. 4. v. 51.
are done for you. Christ dyed for the Church, and not for the Scriptures: the
Church belieueth, hops, loves, and prayseth God, but the Scripture does none
of these: The Church shall reign and live everlastingly with Christ in heaven:
the Scripture shall perish after the day of Judgment. Lastly the Church
contains in it the word of God rightly believed, preached, and the Holy Ghost
it self, all which do far exceed the written word in excellency and dignity.

7. Secondly it may be understood that the Church is above the Scripture, so as
she may change the Scripture, or of Scripture make no Scripture, or lastly she
may teach some what contrary to Scripture, or depart from the true sense of
Scripture: In which sense the Sectaries of this time say, that we affirm the
Church to be above the Scripture. And thus it is false that the Church is above
the Scripture: but neither is there any Catholic which in this sense will
affirm that the Bellar. l. 3. de verbo Dei c. vlt. in resp. ad 14. argum.
Church is above the Scripture, as Bellarmine truly affirms. For if the
Church were in this sense above the Scripture, the Church should err, and be
opposite unto her self, because in that the Church has once approved the
Scripture, she cannot any more reject and disprove it, unless she contradict
her self, which is impossible.

8. The fourth argument. The holy Scripture receives her authority immediately
from God himself, because he is the Author of the Scripture, therefore it does
not receive it authority from the Church. I answer, there be two kinds of
certaynties; the one of the thing in it own Nature; the other in respect of
us: so also there are two kinds of authorityes; the one of the thing considered
in it self, and this has the Scripture from her principal Author, to wit,
God himself: the other is in respect of us, and this it has from the Church;
as we have Cap 13. praeced.. 17. and 19.
proved before out of Calvin and Beza. For we know not otherwise that God is
the Author of the Scripture with any certainty of faith, but by the testimony
of the Church.

9. And that which we have said of the Scripture, may also be evidently seen
in Christ our Lord, who is above the Scripture. For Christ was forced to prove
his authority by miracles, that it might the better be known and allowed of
men. For otherwise the Jews had not been bound to have admitted his
authority. Joan. 15. v. 14. S. Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. 91. in Joan.
Hereupon, says Christ, speaking unto his disciples of the Jews, If I had not
done among them works, that no other man has done, they should not have
sinned, that is to say, of Infidelity, not believing in Christ, a^ S. Augustine
very well expounds. And in another place speaking unto the Jews, Joan. 10.
v. 17.
he says: If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

10. But if the authority of Christ which was most exellent in it self and
immediately from God, stood in need of those means whereby it might become
known unto us, to the end it might oblige us to believe it; much more the
authority of the Scripture will stand in need of it, albeit it be immediately
from God, to the end it be made manifest unto us. For otherwise we should not
be obliged by the authority thereof. But this is not done now by miracles, nor
by the immediate or extraordinary revelation of God: Therefore it rests that
we say, it is done by the ordinary and mediate revelation of God, that is to
say, by the Church, or rather by the holy Ghost, which speaks unto us by the
Church.

CHAP. IX. That the Church is the Judge of all Controversies in matters of
Faith.
SEEING that there arise daily so many disputations and Controuersyes of matters
of faith, none can deny, but that there must necessarily be some Judge
appointed, who must define, end, and determine such Controuersyes, for
otherwise there will never be an end of such matters. But it is a great
difficulty who must be this Judge. The Sectaries of this time almost all refuse
the Judgment of the Church. For they see very well, that if they admit her as
judge, all their errors will be quite overthrown. Wherefore some of them affirm,
that the sole Scripture must be the Judge of all Controversies, and this was
the first doctrine of our Adversaries, to wit, Luther and Zuinglius.

2. But our later Adversaries when they consider, that it is an absurd thing to
make the Scripture (being a thing Cap. 18. Controu. 1.
without life) the Judge, as we have declared before, they fly unto their
private spirit, the which they will have the judge of all Controversies. But
least they may seem to attribute too much unto themselves, they endeavor to
color their private spirit with the famous title or name of the holy Ghost,
affirming the holy Ghost to be the only judge of all Controuersyes.

3. Wherefore there are three things here to be proved. First, that the
Scripture cannot be Judge. Secondly, that neither the private spirit can be it.
Thirdly, that the Catholic Church is the only, and most true Judge of all
Controversies.

4. As concerning the first, whereas our Adu^ersaries every where teach, that
nothing is to be believed which is not expressly to be found in holy
Scripture, it is a strange thing, that they would persuade men, that the
Scripture is the Judge of all Controversies: whereas we read no such thing in
any place of holy Scripture.

5. Yea even in these, testimony is only attributed to the Scriptures, and not
Judgment. Search the Scriptures (says Christ) Joan. 5. v. 19.
and the same are they that give testimony of me And hence it is, that the law
of God is often called in Scripture in the Hebrew phrase Eda, or Eduth, or
Tenda, that is to say. Psalm. 118.
a Testimony; yea even in one Psalm it is called above twenty times by that
name.

6. Moreover in the Prophet Isay, in the same place falsely cited by our
Adversaries, that they may prove thereby the Scripture to be the judge of
Controversies, it is called a witness, or a testimony, and not a Judge: nay
rather to the Isa. 8. v. 20.
Law, says the Prophet, and to the testimony

7. Furthermore, one thing is more absurd, that in matters of such moment, to
appoint such a deaf and dumme judge, and who may also be corrupted for both
parties, and whose sentence eyt^er party uses indifferently. But it is
manifest, that the Scripture is such a judge, for it can neither speak nor
hear: and so in like manner do all Heretics ancient and modern also use the
Scriptures. Lastly almost all our Adversaries do see, how absurd these things
are, and therefore they fly unto their own private spirit, the which they call
the holy Ghost. Wherefore let us come now to the second point.

8. As concerning therefore this private spirit, first there is none who
doubts but that the holy Ghost is the chief Judge of all Controuersyes. But
the question is, where this holy Spirit is to be found, and in whom it
remains.

9. Moreover it is certain, that the holy Ghost does not remain, or is to be
found in any book (least peradventure our Adversaries should send us to their
Bibles) but in the hearts of the belieuers. Now we ask, whether this holy
Ghost which is the Judge of all, be in the heart of every belieuer, or rather in
the heart of the whole Catholic Church. If they say, in the heart of the
Catholic Church, we have our desire: if they say in the heart of every private
man, it will follow that no private person can err in his own judgment,
seeing that the holy Ghost cannot err in his judgment. He^re truly we seek
for that Judge which cannot err.

10. Furthermore every private man shallbe come the Judge of the whole Church,
if every such private person have this spirit, which is the Judge of the whole
Church: whereupon there will ensue a great confusion in the Church of God.

11. Besides that, if every belieuer be the Judge, the^ our Adversaries must
needs admit the ancient Fathers as Judges of all Controversies, the which they
will never do, for they dare not deny, but that the ancient Fathers were true
belieuers* why therefore do they attribute unto themselves that which they so
v^hemently deny to all the ancient Fathers?

21. Moreover, if every belieuer cannot err in his judgment, much less can a
great many such err, and least of all can the Church of all belieuers err.
Wherefore whatsoever our Adversaries say, they will be forced to confess and
grant, that the holy Ghost is the Judge as he remains in the whole Church,
speaking and judging by the mouth thereof: and in this manner even out of our
Adversaries doctrine we gather by a necessary consequence our opinion.

13. Lastly, that which they affirm that the private spirit of every
particular person is Judge, is thereby declared to be false, that they
themselves acknowledge that there is no private man which at some times cannot
err in his indgment: but here we inquire for a Judge which cannot err. For
otherwise in matters of such moment, and of which our eternal salvation
depends, we should dangerously be forced to have recourse to an erroneous
Judge, whose judgment is variable, uncertain, deceitful, and oftentimes
manifestly false.

14. But now as concerning the third point, that the Church is the judge of all
Controversies, we prove by these arguments. First, the Church has all the
properties of a fit judge: for first she has an exact knowledge, the holy
Ghost shall teach you, says Christ, all truth.

15. Secondly, the Church cannot be corrupted by any gifts or prayers. For she
is, as the Apostle witnesses, the pillar and ground of truth.

16. Thirdly, the Church hears, 2. Tim. 3. v. 15.
speaks, gives her judgment, and examineth the testimonies of Scriptures and
Fathers, as experience it self teaches us.

17. Fourthly, we are bound to stand to the judgment of the Church, Who will
not hear the Church, says our Lord, let Matt. 18. v. 17.
him be unto thee as an ^eathen and publican.

18. Fifthly, the Church has power and authority to punish: What, will you 1.
Cor. 4. v. vlt. 2. Cor. vlt. v. 2. 2. Cor. vlt. v, 10.
says the Apostle, that I come unto you with a rod, or in charity, and with
the spirit of mildness? And in another place, If I come again I will not
spare. And again, that being present, I may not deal hardly according to the
power which our Lord has given me unto edification, and not unto destruction.

19. Sixthly, the Church absolueth, byndeth, and retayneth sins,
excommunicateth, Matthew. 18. v. 19. Joan. 20. v. 23.
as the holy Scriptures do expressly testify, and our Adversaries do also
confess, all which acts belong unto Judges, but the Scripture does none of
them.

20. The second argument. The holy Scripture expressly affirms, that the
Church does sometimes judge. I indeed absent in body, but present in spirit
have 1. Cor. 5. v. 34. and 5.
already judged as present, him that has so done: in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the virtue of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one to Satan. And a little after, Do
not you judge of them that are within: where the Apostle ^. Cor. 5. v. 12.
plainly says, that the Pastors of the Church judge those which are in the
Church.

21. The third argument is taken from the common practice of the Church, as well
in the old as in the new Number. 11. ^. 16. 17. and 25. Deuteronomy. 17. ^. 8. and ^eq.
2. Par. 19. v. ^0. and 11.
Testament. For in the old Testament the chief judgment of all causes was
ordained by God himself: first in the book of Numbers, and afterward it was
confirmed in Deuteronomy, in which Judgment the priests did sit as Judges, and
the chief Judge who did give his sentence, for in all things which were
doubtful by the express commandment of God. the common people were sent to
this Judgment of the Church, and not only to the holy Scriptures, or to the
private spirit of any.

22. Moreover till the coming of Christ, this manner of judging continued in
the old Law. For of it Christ himself said, Upon the chair of Moses have
sitten the s^ribes and the Pharisees. All things therefore whatsoever they
shall say to you, observe y^e, and do ye: this Council or Judgment, in the
years following, by cor^upting the Greek word, the Jews called Sanhedrin,
Matt. 2. v. 2. and 3.
as it were (...) that is to say, an assembly or Council.

13. In like manner in the new Testament when there arose that controversy
about the observation of the lega^l ceremonies or customs, the Apostles did
not Act. 15. v. 28.
send their disciples to the holy Scriptures only, or to the private spirit of
any, but they assembled themselves together, and defined what was to be
believed. It seemed good (say they) to the holy Ghost and us. For Act. 15. v.
vlt. and Act. 16. v. 4.
the holy ^host is as it were the soul of the Church. And this Decree of the
Apostles S. Paul, and S. Barnabas did diuulge and promulgate every where, as
appears by the same Chapter, and the next following, where these
determinations of the Apostles, are called Decrees or according Act. 21. v. 25.
to the Greek Phrase (...), that is to s^y, things already judged: whereupon
Act. 21. verse. 25. the Apostles do say, that judging and decreeing they had
written this.

24. In the same manner in the next ages, the Arians, the Macedonia^s, the
Nestorians, Eutichians, and other old Heretics were judged, and condemned by
the Catholic Church in the general Counsels holden at Nice, Constantinople,
Calcedon, and others.

25. Lastly, our Adversaries in their Consistories and Assemblies do usurp
unto themselves, the authority of judges, neither do they refer the judgment
to the Scriptures alone, or to the private spirit of any.

26. Yea Calvin convinced by these reasons confesses, that the writings of
every private person must be submitted to the judgment of the Church. Where he
also concludes thus: Neither therefore, says he, do we condemn, or diminish
the authority of the Church, neither do we give liberty ^o every froward Calu.
in Antid. contra Con^il. Trid. sess. 1. in fine
fellow to do what he list. I would to God they would show us such a Church, as
the holy Scripture does paint or describe unto us, we would easily agree about
the honor thereof. Thus he. But we will show in the ensuing Chapters such a
Church as the Scripture describes: I wish also we may agree concerning the
honor and authority thereof.

27. There are two principal argument^ of our Adversaries: the first is, that
the holy Ghost is not tied unto men, but ^udgeth freely in whatsoever it
pleases him, therefore he is not tied unto the Church. But the same argument
would prove, that there is no certainty in the holy Scriptures. For they who
wrote the Scriptures were men, unto whom, according to our Adversaries
opinion, the holy Ghost was not tied. I answer therefore, that the holy Ghost
is not absolutely bound, or tied unto men, but he is tied to his own promise,
as also to the words and promises of Christ. For neither the holy Ghost, nor
Christ himself can deceive us in not performing their promises, because as the
Apostle Tit. 1. v. 2.
says, God cannot lie. But God has promised that he will be with his Church,
not only one or two days, or one year, but even till the end of the world. He
promised, that he would give the holy Ghost to remain Math. vit. v. vlt.
and stay with us, not for one or two years only, but everlastingly. It is
needful therefore that he perform and stand to his promises.

28. The second argument. If those things which we have said of the Church as
Judge, were true, it would also follow, that the Church is Judge of the holy
Scripture, and consequently of the word of God in general. I answer that the
word of God in general cannot be called in question, or doubted of by any
which professes Christ. For the divine faith cannot be without some word of
God, but where there is noe controversy, there is no need of any Judge. But if
of any one part of the word of God, whether it be written or not written, there
arise any controversy, as for example, of the true sense of the written word,
without doubt we must recurre unto the judgment of the Church: for it
belongs unto her to judge of the truesense of the holy Scripture, and of the
exposition thereof (which is the chiefer Joan. 14. v. 16.
part of the written word) as also of any doubtful letter of the holy
Scripture: for seeing that in times past, there have been many controuersyes
of diverse books of holy Scripture, and of the particular Chapters and parts
thereof, as also of the true sense of the letter, and other written points of
faith, it is manifest, that no^ other Judge but the Catholic Church has ended
or defined all these controuersyes.

29. But in this judgment of the Church there are two things to be
considered; the one, that the Church does not judge of any part of the word of
God out of her own proper sense and judgment, or at her own pleasure without
the word of God, as her Adversaries, and namely Calvin, do wrongfully slander
her: but by one part of the word of God which is better known, she judges of
that which is less known, and manifest unto us: as for example by the word of
God delivered by Traditions, she judges of the written word of God, and of the
true sense thereof.

30. The other thing to be considered, is, that when the Church does judge of
these things they are not men only Act. 15. v. 28.
which judge as our Adversaries pretend, but the holy Ghost also himself who
judges and speaks unto us by the Church. It seemed good, say the Apostles,
to the holy Ghost and us. For even as the actions of a man's body, are not so
properly the actions of the body, as of the soul which quickneth and moves
the body: so the actions of the whole Catholic Church, are not so much to be
attributed unto men, who are as it were the body of the visible Church, as unto
the holy Ghost, who is as it were the soul which gives life and motion to the
body of the Church. They therefore who deny this judgment of the Church, are not
only injurious to the Church, but also to the holy Ghost. Hitherto of the
properties, offices, and power of the true Church of Christ. It Calu. in Antid.
co^tra 4. sess. Council. Trid. in fine.
remains now we show such a Church, as the Scripture declares, and
describes unto us, the which Calvin, as we have said before, earnestly desired
of us.

FINIS.
OF THE MARKS OF THE TRVE CHVRCH. The third Part of the second Controversy.
CHAP. I. Of the false and true Signs, or Marks of the Church in general.
HAVING* in the precedent Controuersyes declared, that Christ and all that good
is, can only be found in the true Church, and that out of it there is nothing
but everlasting damnation: now it remains that we inquire which is that true
Church, where it may be found, and how it is described and set forth in holy
Scripture; for all the sects of heresies go about to challenge her unto
themselves, yea even those who otherwise have a very bad conceyt and opinion of
her. For they see very well that out of her they can expect or hope for no
salvation. But to the end we may not err in matter of so great moment, we will
seek out the true Marks and Signs, whereby the true Church may be certainly
known and discerned from every false and counterfeit Church.

2. Our Adversaries do commonly Calu. l. 4. Inst c. 7. sect 9. and 10. Bez. in
sua confess. c. 5. Art. 7. Centuriatores 1. Centur. l. 1. c. 4. l. 2. cap. 4.
set down two signs or marks of the true Church, to wit, the sincere
preaching of the word of God, and the lawful administration of the Sacraments.
Bez^ adds a third sign to wit, the Ecclesiastical discipline practiced,
agreeable to the word of God. The Lutherans annexed unto these a fourth sign,
to wit, an Obedience toward ministers. Of this fourth sign we will speak a
little after, for it is reduced to the unity of the Church. But the three
signs set down by the Caluinists are altogether foolish and frivolous, the
which we prove thus.

3. First by the very nature of a sign. For every sign of it own nature S.
Aug. Tom. ^. l. 2. de doct Christ. cap* 1. and 3. Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 17.
sect. 11.
is a sensilbe thing, as all teach, following therein S. Augustine; and our
Adversaries confess this to be true when they treat of the Sacraments: Yea
Calvin writes, that this was always as it were a matter of faith in the
Church. And so do all teach now who are of understanding. Truly none will say,
that which is only believed in the Sacrament, is a sign, but that which is
seen. But these signs of the Church prescribed by our Adversaries can neither
be seen nor perceived by any sense. Yea not even by our understanding, unless
it be illuminated by faith. For by faith only are they preceyued: because none
can know which is the sincere preaching, lawful administration of the
Sacraments or Ecclesiastical discipline prescribed by Christ, but by faith:
wherefore they who say that these are the signs and marks of the Church do
not indeed know what they say; even as if one should affirm, that in the
Sacrament of baptism the ablution and the words are not signs, but the
effect of baptism which is not seen, which every man sees how absurd it is.

4. The second reason. Every sign of any thing must be more manifest and
better known, then the thing it self whose sign it is, because it is put for
that end that it may be a sign or token whereby that other thing may be known,
but these signs of the Church alleged by our Adversaries, are more obscure
and uncertain then the Church it self. For the Church is at the least
oftentimes visible as they themselves confess, but these their signs be never
visible but always invisible, for they can only be known by faith, as we have
already declared, but that which is by faith declared is necessarily obscure,
because faith as witnesses the Heb. 11. v. 1.
Apostle, is the argument of things not appearing, and hence it is, that all
sects do brag and boast that they have these signs, because indeed they
cannot be clearly seen of any.

5. The third reason. Our Adversaries do allege in vain these signs, for
therefore do we enquire for signs and Marks of the Church, that they which are
ignorant of her, may thereby come to know her, for they who already know any
thing do not need any signs, as for example, he who already knows very well
this City needs no mark or sign thereof whereby he may know it. But he
stands in need of signs who never saw this City. So in like manner they who
are out of the Church and know her not, do most of all need some signs and
marks whereby to know her, but these which our Adversaries assign, can be
known by none but by those who are already within the Church and know her very
well, having the true faith and belief thereof, but they cannot be understood
by those who know not the true Church, to the end they may seek and find her,
because they are only perceived and known by faith, they are therefore
alleged in vain by our Adversaries.

6. But neither can these signs be known of all those who are in the Church,
but only of the more learned in the Church. For every one of the common people
cannot discern which is the sincere preaching of the word of God, or the
lawful administration of the Sacraments, and the Ecclesiastical discipline
prescribed by the word of God, for it is necessary that he who knows all
these things well, should also understand almost all the holy Scripture.
Moreover there is as yet a very great controversy among ^ur Adversaries
themselves concerning these three signs, whiles that some of them do contend,
and strive, that this is the sincere preaching of the word of God, others that
some do say that this is the lawful administration of the Sacraments, others
that some do say, this is the discipline prescribed by the word of God, others
assign another quite different from this.

7. But our Adversaries do in very truth confound the offices of the Church
with the signs thereof. For to preach sincerely to administer the Sacraments
lawfully, and to appoint the discipline of the Supr. c. 1. buius co^*. 9. and
seq.
Church rightly, are the offices of the Church, as we have declared before, and
not the signs thereof: these signs therefore being rejected which our
Adversaries do assign, it remains that we enquire out the true signs of the
Church.

8. But this is first to be presupposed as it were the ground of all that we
are to speak of this matter. That even natural reason it self does clearly
demo^strat, that there is some true Church of God here upon earth. For this is
one of those first principles of faith, which are as evidently proved by
natural reason, as that there is a God. Wherefore the Apostle places these
two amongst the first grounds of our faith: he that comes to God, says he,
must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to the^ that seek Hebr. v. ^.
him. But they which so seek after God, that they may be rewarded by him, are
without all doubt in the true Church.

4. Moreover natural reason it self does evidently teach us, that it is an
absurd thing to think that there is no way left by God for men to obtain
their eternal salvation, seeing that this is quite opposite to the providence
of God, and to his infinite goodness: but there is no other way besides the
Church, as we have declared before; Cap. 2^ huius co^trouersiae.
but because there are so many and so diverse opinions of men concerning this so
necessary a way to salvation, there are also certain signs and marks thereof
set down, that we may the better understand which is indeed the certain and
most true way.

10. Out of these which we have now Supra c. 14. huius controu.. 5. in fine.
said, follows first, that that which we have insinuated before is most true,
to wit, that it is more certain and evident that there is the holy Scripture,
seeing that it is manifest by natural reason that there must needs be some
Church of God here upon earth, the which is not so evident of the holy
Scriptures.

11. The second thing which ensues is, that to these signs of the true Church
these two co^ditious are altogether necessary. The first is, that they must be
such as that they may not only be perceived by faith, and our understanding,
but even by sense it self, for other wise they cannot be true signs, as we
have already proved. The other is, that they be known and manifest to all men,
even unto Infidells, seeing that otherwise Isa. 35. v 8.
they cannot help them, or convince and bring them to the true Church. For the
Church of Christ, as the Prophet testifies, is a direct way, so that fools,
that is to Bellarm per totu^ l. 4. de Eccles. milita^te. Bozius de signis
Ecclesiae. Coccius Tom. 1. per totum. l. 8.
say Infidells, cannot err by it.

12. Of these signs of the true Church Bellarmine, Coccius, and Thomas Bozius
Eugubinus discourse at large, who has gathered twenty four signs in all of
the true Church, all which he manifestly proves to agree to the Roman Church:
out of these Authors more signs may be required.

13. But we regarding our intended breuity, will only allege four, which are
set down in the Nicene and Constantinopolitan Creed, that is to say, that this
true Church is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolical. For these four signs
are so certain, that they cannot be rejected even by our Adversaries. First
because they are expressly set down in holy Scripture, as we will show in the
next Chapter. Moreover our Adversaries do profess that they admit and receive
three Creeds to wit, the Apostles Creed, the Nicene, and Rupell. Co^fess.
Artic. 5. in fine.
that of S. Athanasius. But in that which we call the Nicen Creed, these four
signs of the Church are expressly set down, whereof we will now speak more
particulerly.

CHAP. II. That the true Church of Christ is One, Holy, Catholic, and
Apostolical.
S. Augustine very well admonishes us, that when we dispute against S. Aug.
Tom. 7. de unit. Eccles. cap. 3.
heretics which do admit the holy Scriptures, we should prove the true Church
of Christ and the signs thereof out of the said holy writ. For as the same
holy Father notes in another place, the Prophets had spoken more obscurely of
Christ S. Aug. Tom. 8. co^. 2. in Psalm. 30. super ea verba v. 12. qui videbant
me for as fugerunt a me.
then they did of the Church, because by their Prophetical spirit they did see
that there would arise greater strife and debate about the Church the^ of
Christ himself. We will therefore here prove these four signs of the Church.
First out of the Scripture, and secondly by natural reason, seeing that these
signs must be such as may convince those which do not admit the Scriptures, as
we have declared in the precedent Chapter.

2. The first sign of the true Church of Christ is Unity. For there is a
threefold unity, necessarily preached in the Church of Christ. The first is, of
all the members with Christ, who is the supreme head of the Church, the which
is effected by faith; wherefore it necessarily follows, that there must be
but one faith of all the members of the Church. One Lord and God, says the
Apostle, and one faith, and again, until we all meet in the unity Ephesians. 4.
v. 5. Ephesians. 4. v. 13.
of faith.

3. The second Unity is of all the members among themselves: for as he who
dissolueth the first unity is an heretic: so he, which violateth this is a
schismatike: wherefore Christ says, in this all men shall know that you are my
disciples, if you have love one to another. And the Apostle, That there might
be no schism in the body, but the members Joan. 13. v. 15. 1. Cor. 1. v. 25.
1. Cor. 24. v. 33.
together might be careful one for another. Finally, God is not the God of
dissension, but of peace: as also in all the Churches of the Saints I teach,
says the same Apostle.

4. The third unity is betwixt the faithful people and their Pastors by
obedience, the which whosoever dissolve are also to be accounted schismatikes:
of Hebr. vlt. v. 17.
this the same Apostle writes thus: Obey your Prelates, and be subject to
them, and this is that fourth mark of the Church assigned by Cap. prae^dent..
the Lutherans, as we have said in the precedent Chapter, the second.

5. This threefold unity is very sensible, the which may easily be perceived
even by any Infidel. For the disagreement of doctrine concerning matter of
faith may easily be heard, the dissentions of the people among themselves or
with their Pastors may manifestly be perceived.

6. Finally even natural reason it self proves this to be one of the most
certain signs of the true Church. For God cannot teach contrary and opposite
doctrine, because he then should be a liar, Hebr. ^. v. 18.
which according to the apostle is impossible. In like manner natural reason
shows that God, which is goodness it self cannot be the author of schisms,
and dissentions, but of concord, peace, and unity.

7. The second sign is Holiness: the holy Scripture is full of testimonies
and authorities, whereby this sign is most evidently proved and declared. For
S. Paul in the beginning of almost all his Epistles calls the Churches unto
whom he writes, Holy, as is to be seen in the beginning of the Epistles to
the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, and to
the Colossians: and S. Peter called the 2. Petr. 2. v. 9.
the true Church, an holy Nation. So also Christ himself says. For then I do
sanctify Joan. 17. v 1^. 1. Petr. 1. v. 16.
my self, that they also may be sanctified in truth. Lastly that sentence is
often repeated in the holy Scripture the which S. Peter cites also out of the
old testament, be ye holy, because I am holy.

8. The sign also is visible unto all, first because this sanctity is to be
seen Matt. 5. v. 16.
by good works, that they may see, says Christ, your good works, and may
glorify your Father which is in heaven. Secondly this sanctity Ad Titu^ 2. v.
1. and 8.
may be seen by their pious and holy doctrine. For it is necessary that the
true doctrine of God, be holy, sound and irreprehensible. Thirdly, this
sanctity is seen by the miracles, whereby God himself testifies and
confirms the sanctity of his Church. And, them that believe, says Christ,
these signs shall follow: in Marc. vlt. v. 17.
my name they shall cast out Devils.

9. This sign also of Sanctity is evident to all, even by natural reason. For
a good tree brings forth good fruit. And contrariwise Matt. 7. v. 18.
a bad tree brings forth ill fruit. Moreover wicked doctrine which is either
against the Law of Nature or good manners cannot be of God: on the other side
the doctrine which is agreeable to the Law of nature and good manners is of God.
Finally true miracles do convince that there is the true Church of Christ where
such miracles are done, seeing that true niracles can only be done by the power
of God, for even as God alone has made and ordained all things: so God only
can change at his pleasure the Natures of things, and the natural order
thereof, according to that saying of the Ps^m. 71 v. 18.
Prophet David, Blessedbe our Lord God of Israel, who can only work miracles.
But God who is goodness it self cannot testify or approve any false doctrine
by miracles.

10. The third sign of the true Church Su^r. c. ^. huius Co^trouers. S. Aug.
Tom. 7. pertotum lib. devni. Eccles. Genesis 12* v 3. Genesis 22. v. 8. Psalm. 2. v.
8. Psalm* 1. v. 8. and 11. Act. 1. v. 8. Romans 10. v. 18. Colos. 1. v. 6.
is, that it is Catholic, or Universal, and that two ways. First because it
continuethal ways, as we have proved already. Secondly it is also Catholic or
universal, because since the coming of Christ it is dilated and propagated
over all the whole word.

11. S. Augustine uses this argument most of all against the Donatists to show
the true Church. For first God promised Abraham, that all Nations should be
blessed in his seed, and afterward he confirmed the same with an Oath. So God
the Father said unto Christ: Ask of me, and I will give thee Nations for thy
inheritance, and the limits of the earth for thy possession. Many such like
places are in the Psalms, and in the new Testament.

12. And this sign is also visible, because that which is every where, and at
all times, may be seen of all men, when it is a thing that can be seen as
this is.

13. Moreover this sign is very certain even by the light of nature. For
natural reason teaches us, that the providence of God extends it self very
carefully over all those which are his: and that falsity cannot always
continue, but must needs be overcome by truth, and that God is of greater
power and able to do more then the Devil. Yea the beginning and progress of
all false religions, Bel^ar. l. 4. de Eccles. milit. c. 5. and 6. Act. 5. v.
38. and 39.
as Bellarmine well notes, are certainly known. Finally the work and
counsel of men, but not of God is quickly dissolved, as Gamaliel says in S.
Luke.

14. The fourth sign of the true Church of Christ is, that it is Apostolical,
to wit, founded by the Apostles of Christ: and that she has continued ever
since their time, till these our days, by a continual succession. For this
sign as also the former is the proper mark of the Church of the new
Testament, for of it is all our Controversy. But that the Church of Christ was
founded by the Ephesians* 2. v. 20. Cap. ^ 4. and 8 ^huius controu. Isa. 59. v. vl.
Ierem. 33. v. 17. and 18.
Apostles, appears evidently by those words of S. Paul: built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. And we have already proved the
continual succession of the Church by many testimonies of Scripture. The same
also the Prophets do testify in many places.

15. Moreover seeing that there are, as the Apostle says, always Pastors and
Doctors in the Church, without whom she cannot consist and continue, as our
Adversaries confess, it necessarily follows as we have declared before, that
there has always been a continual succession of these Pastors and Doctors
in the true Church of God.

16. But that which many do say, is both foolish and frivolous, to wit, that
there has been always a continual succession of doctrine in the Church, but
not of persons. For seeing that true doctrine must needs proceed from some
persons, and those of men (for not Angels but men do teach now adays) if the
true doctrine continues, it is also necessary that the men which teach this
doctrine Supra c. 8. huiu^ controuersi^.
continue still, and such also as are lawfully called to this office, as we
have proved before.

17. This continual sucession is also a visible sign, because in some parts
or persons thereof it may be seen at all times, as successiue and transitory
things are wont to be seen: for in this manner only can a river, for example
sake, and time it self be seen.

18. Finally this sign is also certain and evidently well known among the
Infidells: for unless this succession be continual, the true Church of God
shall altogether perish and decay, all honor and worship of the true God will be
overthrown, and there will remain no way for men to their eternal salvation.
But on the other side where there is a continual succession, and a
neuer-interrupted continuance of the same Religion, there appears
sufficiently a great providence and a singular assistance of Almighty God
toward men.

19. Furthermore that which we have hitherto said of these four signs might
suffice, but that the pertinacy and inconstancy of our Adversaries is so very
admirable and great. For albeit in one place they acknowledge themselves to
receive R^^ell. Confess. Art. 5 in fine.
the Nicen Creed, wherein these four signs of the Church are expressly
contained, yet notwithstanding else where when they see themselves manifestly
convinced Extatbis lib. in 3. volum^. Tract. Theol. Bezae Tract. 6.
by these signs of perfidious dealing, they do vterly reject the^. For Beza in
his book of the true and visible signs of true Catholic Church (wherein
notwithstanding he goes about nothing else but to establish those his invisible
marks of the Church) albeit he affirms that his followers do acknowledge
all those Creedes which have been always approved by the common Habe^tur h^c
p. 138. sub fin. edit. Geneu. Anno. 1582.
consent of the whole Church, to wit that of the Apostles, the Nicene, that of
S. Athanasius, the Constantinopolitane, and the Calcedon, yet for all this, he
impugneth these marks of the Church, of which he knows that he and his are
altogether destitute, and especially the fourth, which is deduced from the
Apostolical succession.

20. He therefore obiecteth these Ita Beza. p. 137. in princip. vbi supra.
signs that they are not proper unto the Church quarto modo, as Prophyrius,
and other Logitians define proprium quarto modo, because they do not agree to
the true Church only. For unity and succession may also be found amongst wicked
men as appears by the Jews and Mahomets. But these are easily answered. For
these signs are not alleged as properties quarto modo, as Beza thinks, but
rather as it were accidents by the collection, whereof Indiuidua are
distinguished one from another, Porph. c. de specie. in^^^e.
as the same Porphyrius teaches: for those accidents, whereby Indiuidua are
distinguished, may be found separated one from another in diverse substances,
but not all gathered together in one.

21. Wherefore, seeing that the Church is one, singular, and indivisible, we must
not only allege the properties thereof, but also other signs, as it were
qualities and accidents, whereby this true Church may be distinguished from all
others. For albeit some one or other of these signs may be found in some other
things, yet they cannot all four together be found any where, but in the true
Church.

22. Therefore any one of these signs considered by it self, separateth the
true Church from the false, as for example, the unity of doctrine, and
continual succession does separate and distinguish her from any heretical
Church: but all these signs or marks joined and united together do
distinguish the Church of Christ altogether from every false Church: and this
is sufficient that they may be called most true signs in their kind. Supr. c.
1. huius co^trouers.


23. We surely have already in the beginning of the precedent controversy
spoken of the true properties of the Church, to wit, when we declared that she
is the spouse, body, Kingdom, inheritance, and city of Christ, for these are
propria quarto modo, and in this manner they all; always, and only agree to
the true Church of Christ.

24. Moreover seeing that these properties are so invisible, as that they
cannot be perceived by any sense, but only by faith, they are not sufficient to
convince Infidels, Heretics, and others which want true faith: and for this
cause other visible signs are also necessary which may be perceived by all, as
also convince them, of which sort are these four signs which we have now
alleged.

25. That in the mean time we may omit, that the late and new vpstart Churches
of our Adversaries are so much worse then the Churches of Jews and Infidels,
because sometimes in these some one or other of the aforesaid signs may Infr.
cap. 22. huius Controu.
be found. But in our Adversaries Church as we will show herafter, not one of
them can be found.

CHAP. III. That the Roman Church only, is the true Church of Christ, is proved
by the properties of the true Church.
HITHERTO we have described out of holy Scripture the true Church of Christ,
and that by the properties, offices, and peculiar signs thereof. Now it
remains that we by the same enquire and examine in what part or place of the
world this true Church of Christ may be found, the which will easily be done,
if we declare that all these propertyes, offices, and signs must needs agree
to some one. We therefore do affirm that all the offices, properties, and
signs of the true Church do only agree to the Roman Church.

2. It is here notwithstanding to be considered, least some perchance by the
ambiguity or equivocation of the word be deceived, that we do not understand
by the Roman Church, that which is only at Rome, as our Adversaries go about to
persuade the ignorant, but plainly every Church which agrees in the unity of
the same faith with the Roman, and which obeys the Bishop of Rome, whersoeuer
that Church be, whether at Rome, or else where, yea even the furthest part of
the Indyes. Moreover that this Roman Church thus understood is the only true
Church of Christ, and consequently that out of her we cannot hope for eternal
salvation (seeing that out of the true Church, as we Cap. 1. buius Controuers.
have sufficiently declared before* we cannot be saved) we will evidently
demonstrate by all the properties, offices, and signs before alleged of the
true Church. And first we will speak of the properties, to wit, of those which
agree unto her quarto modo. For all these do very well agree to the Roman
Church, and to no other. The which we declare in this manner.

3. First the Roman Church is the espouse of Christ. For that she was betrothed
and espoused unto Christ by true^ faith, those words of the holy Scripture do
plainly testify: Your faith, says the Apostle Romans 1. v. 8.
writing to the Romans, is renowned in the whole world. And a little after S.
Paul professes himself to agree in the unity of faith with the Roman Church,
that is to profess the Roman Faith, and not that of VVittemberge, as Luther,
or that of Geneua, as Calvin did. Wherefore with good right we profess our
selves not only to be the children of the Catholic, but also of the Catholic
Roman Church and faith, the which S. Paul also manifestly professes himself
to be.

4. But our Adversaries object, that the Church of Rome in the Apostles time
had the true faith, but afterward she forsook and lost it. So in times past
those Heretics which were called Donatists, when they were urged by the
arguments of Catholics, were wont to say, that indeed the Church of Rome was
famous over all the world in the Apostles time, but in their time she perished
in all the other parts of the world and remained only among the Donatists in
S. Aug. Tom. 7. de unit. Eccles. cap. 12.
Afric, whom S. Augustine refuteth very well, and we imitating him herein
will use this kind of argument: That the faith of the Roman Church was once the
true and sincere faith, the holy Scripture does expressly testify: but that the
same Church afterward forsook or lost her former faith, is no where extant in
holy writ: therefore we must not believe that which is so expressly against the
Scripture.

5. And this argument indeed urges much more our Adversaries then the
Donatists, seeing that they teach, that we must believe nothing which is not
expressly in Scripture, but this is no where to be found expressly therein, to
wit, that the Roman Church forsook or lost her faith which she had received
from the Apostles. And truly there can be no greater sign of the want of
learning and judgment then to think that, that Church forsook and lost her
faith, whose faith even the express word of God does so greatly commend unto
us, unless this her forsaking and loosing of her former true faith can be
proved out of the same word of God.

6. Our Adversaries indeed say, that they will prove it in some particular
points of faith, but they will never be able to perform their promise, as in
every particular Controversy will appear.

7. Moreover God promises to this espouse of Christ, by the Prophet Isay, the
which he also confirmed with an Oath, that she should be invested and adorned
with diverse Nations and People. For so speaks God to the Church: Lift up thy
eyes and look round about thee, and see: all these Isa. 40. v. 18.
are gathered together, they are come unto thee. As I live, says our Lord,
thou shall be invested with all these, as with an ornament: and thou shall
compass them about unto thy selse as a spouse. So the Roman Church has
always had and still has many Nations and People subject unto her, wherewith
she is invested and adorned, the which even our Adversaries cannot deny.

8. Secondly the Church is the visible and mystical body of Christ, but in the
Roman Church there has always been, and now also there is the visible body of
Christ consisting of diverse members and states: as also of Doctors and
Pastors, whereof S. Paul speaks, writing to the Ephesians and Corinthians,

9. Thirdly the Church is the Kingdom of Christ, but in the Roman Ephesians. 4.
v. 11. and 12. 1. Cor. 12. v. 12.
Church there has always and now also is the visible Kingdom of Christ, and
that such a one as the Prophet Isay described when he says, that Kings and
Queens shall be thy nurses. For there has Isa. 46. v 23.
ever been since the conversion of Nations, many Kings and Monarkes who have
agreed in unity of faith, with the Roman Church, and have acknowledged always
the Bishop of Rome to be the chief head and Pastor of all the whole Coccius
Tom 1. l. art. 7. 8.
militant Church, as may appear by that which Coccius has set down in his
Catalogue to this purpose.

10. Furthermore the Prophet Jeremy thus describes the future Kingdom of
Ierem. 33. v. 20. 21. and 22.
Christ. This says our Lord, If my covenant can be broken and made void with
the day, and my covenant with the night, so that there be neither day nor night
in their due times; then my covenant can be broken with my servant David, that
there shall not be a son of his reigning in his throne, and the Leuits and
Priests my ministers: as the ^larres of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the
sands of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of my servant David,
and the Leuits my Ministers. Thus says God by his Prophet of the Kingdom of
Christ his son, and of the Leuits, and Priests ministering unto our Lord, and
of the infinite number of them, which is manifest to have been fullfilled
hitherto in the Roman Church:

11. Fourthly, the Church is the Inheritance of Christ, to wit that which
according Psalm. 2. v. 8. Psalm. 1. v. 7. 8. Isa. 51* v. 10.
to the oracles of the Prophets extends her self to the very bounds and
limits of the whole earth, which is in the eyes of all Nations, the which all
the corners of the earth shall see, and lastly which is exte^ded from the east
to the west. Man ab. 1. v. 12.
But in the Roman Church there has always been such an inheritance of Christ.

12. Hereupon are those famous words of S. Leo to the City of Rome: These are
they who have exalted thee to this glory, that being a holy Nation, a chosen
people, a priestly and S. Leo sermon. 1. in Natal. Apost. Petri and Pausi.
a princely City, by the holy seat of S. Peter made the head of the world,
should have a more large command by the means of divine Religion, then ever
thou had by forr^ine domination. For albeit thou being famous, renowned for
many victories have extended the limits of thy Empire both by sea and land, yet
notwithstanding it is less which thy warlike labor has subdued, then that
which the Religion of Christ has made subject unto thee. Hitherto S. Leo.

13. Moreover S. Prosper the great glory of Aquitania, and dearly beloved
friend of S. Augustine, and who defended egregiously his doctrine against the
Pelagians, in a certain book written in verse against the same Pelagians,
speaking of their heresies writes thus: When this infectious pestilence arose,
Rome Peter's seat first gave it deadly blows: S. Prosp. in lib. de Ingratis
cont. Pelag. c. 2.

Which made the head of pastoral dignity,
Whereto the whole world should obedient be,
Could more now subject by Religions law,
Then her fierce armies erst could keep in awe.
Thus wrote he a 1200. years ago.

14. But in this our age the faith of the Roman Church is propag^ted, and
preached in the most remote Countries of the East and West. Yea even unto the
furthest parts of the world, in so much that the children of the Church of Rome
come oftentimes from the East to the West, according to that of the Prophet
Malachy: to wit, from the East Indies to the West, and they Malac. 1. v. 12.
co^pas the whole globe of the earth to the end they may preach the faith of
the Roman Church every where. Wherefore the faith of the Roman Church is
preached and received in this ou^ age in many and more remote places of the
world, the^ ever it was in the Apostles time, the which is most assuredly
testified by the letters and books even of them, who write what themselves have
seen.

15. Fifthly, the Church is the City of Christ, placed upon a mountain, which
cannot be hidden; so the Church of Rome Matt. 5. v. 14.
has always been visible ever since the Apostles time: neither can it ever be
hidden. By these it appears that all the true properties of the Church of
Christ agree to the Church of Rome.

16. But that they cannot agree with any other, it appears sufficiently by
that our Adversaries can assign no Church which can have these properties.
Wherefore it is necessary that they confess the Church of Rome to be the true
Church of Christ, or truly, which is most absurd, that Christ has wanted and
been deprived of his spouse now for the space of a thousand years and more,
as also to have wanted his body, City, Kingdom, and Inheritance.

CHAP. IIII. That the Church of Rome is the true Church of Christ, is proved by
the offices of the true Church.
IN the precedent Chapter we have Supr. 18. huius Controuers. 3. 4. and 5.
proved, that the Roman Church is the true Church of Christ by the properties
of the same: now it remains that we prove it by the peculiar offices and
functions of the true Church: many reasons may by deduced out of these, but we
will briefly touch only the chiefest.

2. The first reason is taken from those very signs which our Adversaries
assign, that is to say, the true and sincere preaching of the word of God, and
the lawful administration of the Sacraments, which are indeed offices and not
signs of the Church, as we hane said before; but whether they be signs or
offices, by them it is evidently proved that the Roman Church and no other is
the true Church of Christ. But for the space of a thousand years last past the
Sacraments were no where lawfully administered, nor the word of God sincerely
preached, but in the Church of Rome. For our Adversaries cannot name any
Church, wherein these things have been done. Therefore either the Roman is the
true Church, or else Christ has had no Church for the space of a thousand
years and more. Calu. l. 4. Inst. c. 2. sect. 11. and 21. Beza de notis
Eccles. p. 145. in fine Geneu. edit. an. 1582.


3. Neither must our Adversaries answer us with Calvin and Beza, that their
Church indeed remained in the Popedom (for they cannot find it any where else)
yet half destroyed and filthily corrupted and defaced with many errors. For
here we inquire after the true Church of Christ, and not such a profane and
filthy Church which Calvin describes* wherein Christ as it were lies half
dead and buried, the Ghospel overthrown, and Calu. sect. 12. citat.
piety banished, the worship of God almost quite abolished: for such a Church
is not indeed the true Church of Christ, but a den of Devils.

4. Moreover they must not here run to any invisible Church altogether
unknown both to themselves and us, the which our Adversaries seem to
establish. For we have sufficiently declared before, Supr. c. 4. huius cont.
that the true Church of Christ has been always visible. Wherefore it is
necessary they show us some other visible, besides the Roman Church, wherein for
a thousand years past the Gospel has bin publicly preached in the same
manner they preach it now, and the Sacraments publicly administered as they are
now, and that continually also without interruption: Or truly they must
confess, that the Roman Church is the true Church of Christ. For in this the
old and new testament has always been publikly preached without any
intermission, and all the Sacraments publicly administered, and that sincerely
and lawfully according to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, as we will
here after declare in the Co^trouersyes concerning the Sacraments.

5. The Lutherans, that they might avoid Vide c^nsuram Orientalis Ecclesiae. ^
Stanisla^ Socolonio Polono ex Graeco in Latinu^ conuers.
this argument, fled to the Grecian Church, where they affirmed the true Church
of Christ remained. But they were presently rejected and condemned by them, as
may be seen in the answer of Jeremy the Patriarch of Constantinople to the
Germans, written in Greek in the year 1576. Neither do the Grecians disagree
from the Roman Church in those points which are now adays in Controversy, but
in that one article of faith wherein they affirm, that the holy Ghost does only
proceed from the Father, and not the Son. The which error even all Rupell.
Confess. Art. 6.
our Adversaries which follow Luther and Calvin do condemn, as well as we.

6. The which when the later Sectaries well perceived, they were forced at
length to fly to those Heretics which were in times past condemned by the
whole Church, amongst whom they seek for their Church. Where we are to
consider three things against the great boldness of these men.

7. The first is, that the true Church has always continued, as we have
declared Cap. 3. huius Cont^. Geneb. in Chron. Coccius Tom. 1. l. 8. art. 2.
Histor. Magdeb. Lu^heran.
before out of the Scriptures. But these men can never show a continual
succession of Heretics of what religion soever they were, but only an
interrupted continuance, and that sometimes for a great space together. The
which may easily be understood by Genebrard, Coccius, and all other
Ecclesiastical writers of what religion soever they be.

8. The second. Our Adversaries cannot prove all their points out of any one
ancient Heretic, but they borrow Lyndanus in tabulis. Coccius Tom. 1. lib. 8.
Art. 3.
one heresy condemned in times past of one, and another of some other, as
Lindanus, and Coccius very well declare at large.

9. The third is, that our Adversaries must needs confess, that those of
whom they have begged and borrowed Sander. lib. 7. d^ visibili Monar. Eccl.
Prateol. in Elench. H^ret. Coccius Tom. 1. l. 8. Art. 3. and 4.
their doctrine, did err foully in many points of faith, and therefore there
could be no true Church among them. Yea even those ancient heretics have
firmly and constantly believed many points with us against our Aduesaries, as
Doctor Sanders, Gabriel Prateolus, and Coccius do manifestly declare.

10. The second reason. The office of the true Church is to bring forth
children to God, that is to say, to convert Infidels and Gentills from their
Idolatry to the Catholyke faith. This the R^man Church has performed not only
in the first five or six hundred years after Christ, as our Adversaries
confess, but in every age afterward she has done the same. For since the sixth
hundred year all these Nations were converted to the faith of Baron. Tom. 9.
10. 11. and 12. Magdeb. Cen^. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. vbiq. cap. ^.
Christ by the children of the Roman Church, the Germans, the Francones,
Bauarians, VVandalls, Bulgarians, Scl^uonians, Polonians, Danes, Morauians,
Hungarians, N^r^egians, Frisones, Normans, Sueuians, Visigothes, Lituanians, as
not only Catholic writers do testify, which Baronius alleges, but even our
Adversaries also in their Ecclesiastical histories. And in this our age how
many have been converted from Idolatry to the faith of Christ in the East and
West Indies by the preachers of the Roman Church only, none is ignorant.

11. This office of the Church in times past Tertullian observed, What shall I
Tertull. de praesc. aduers. Haeret. 42.
speak of the preaching and administration of the word of God, seeing that this
office and business belongs not unto them (he speaks of heretics) who do
not convert Infidells, but overthrow and pervert Christians?

12. And S. Augustine for the same cause S. Aug. Tom. 8. l. 13. cont. ^austum
Manich. c. 12. Ierem. 7. v. 11.
says, that Heretics are compared to a Partridge by the Prophet Jeremy, where
it is said, That a Partridge nourishes and gathers together those which she
has not brought forth. For S Augustine affirms, that Heretics go about to
seduce and deceive Christians whom they see borne again to God by the Gospel
of Christ.

13. The third reason. The proper office of the Church is to prevail against
all persecutors. The gates of hell (says our Matt. 16. v. 18. S. Hilar. l. 7.
de Trinit. circa principi^m.
Lord) shall not prevail against my Church. Hereupon says Hilary, This is the
property of the Church, that she then preu^ileth most when she is persecuted,
then she is understood when she is reprehended, then she gets the victory
when she is as it were forsaken. But the Roman Church has sustained hitherto
many persecutions, contradictions, assaults, and false slanders* but she has
ever gotten the victory both of the Gentills, Heretics, and bad Christians
persecuting the Church of God, as all Ecclesiastical histories and experience
also does testify. For even to this day for the space of almost a thousand and
six hundred years she is still constant, immovable, and invincible in despite
of all her Adversaries.

14. Our Adversaries indeed in diverse books published against the Pope of Rome
heap up together many in diverse ages who have opposed themselves against him,
but they can find none who have at any time quite overthrown the Roman Church.
We know very well that wicked men are never wanting, who vehemently oppose
themselves against Bal^us and Magdeb. Centur.
the devout servants of God, but at the last they are all overcome by the
Church, and they shall never get the victory against her. For Christ did not
say, that the gates of hell should not oppugn his Church, but that they should
never prevail against her.

15. Finally look how many oppugners and perlecutors of the Roman Matt. 16. v.
18.
Church our Adversaries heap together so many famous momuments unawares do
they erect, by which the triumphs of the Roman Church are commended to
posterity, against their wills. But there cannot be a famous victory, unless
some conflict went before, and so we see truly fullfilled in the Church of
Rome, that which long before was foretold by the Prophet David in the person of
the true Church of God. They have often oppugned me, even from any youth, but
they could not prevail, the which is Psalm. 128. vel tuxta Heb. 129. v. 2.
better expressed in the Hebrew text, as may be seen in the Latin Edition.

16. This continual victory of the Roman Church against her enemies S. Paul
foretold very clearly when he wrote in this manner to the same Church: the God
of peace will crush Satan under your feet quickly. Romans vlt. v. 20. S. Hier. in
Apol. aduers. Ruffin. S. Cypr. Epist. 55. ad Cornel. seul. 1. Epist. 3.
To this very place appertains that which S. Hierome writes, to wit, that
the Roman faith being confirmed by the althority of S. Paul, cannot be changed,
albeit an Angel should teach the contrary to that which was once preached. And
before him S. Cyprian, when he says, that the Romans are those unto whom
falsehood or infidelity can have noe access.

17. The fourth reason. The office of the true Church to is keep, and preserve
always faith sound and without any stayne of heresy, which then she
performs, when she discovers and condemns all heretical and erroneous
opinions, and when she explicateth and declares all doubtful and obscure
points of faith. Moreover she commands obstinate and wilful persons to
hold their peace. Finally she ce^sureth all erroneous and dangerous books,
lest Catholics be indomaged thereby either in faith or in good manners. All
these things the Roman Church and no other, as appears by all
historiographers, has always ever since the Apostles time performed, yea
there are many heresies the which even our Adversaries do condemn, which were
in times past not by any general Council, but only by the Church of Rome
suppressed, as that of the Pelagians, Donatists, Priscillianistes etc.

18. The fifth reason. The office of S. Ambr* in orat. de obitufratris Satyri.
Victor. l. 1. and 2. de Vandal. persecut.
the true Church is by her name and communion to distinguish true Catholics
from false and counterfaite, but by the name and Communion of the Roman Church,
Catholics were always distinguished from heretics. He asked the Bishop
(says S. Ambrose speaking of his brother) whether he agreed with the Catholic
Bishops, that is to say, with the Roman Church? So also S. Ambrose and S.
Victor S. Greg. Turon. l. 1. de glor. Mart. c. 25. 79. and 80. Vide Council. 3.
Tolet. in princ. and Baron. Tom. ^. an 584. n. 35. in fine. Euthin. 2. pan.
tit. 21.
Vticensis who lived in S. Augustines time do testify, that the Arians were
wont to call Catholics, Romans, or Romanists: the same writes S. Gregory
Turonensis of the Arian Goths which were in Spain. The Bishops also of Spain
being converted from Arianisme to the Catholic ^ayth, among other things they
condemned a certain book set forth by the Arians with this title, The passage
of the Romans to the Arian Church. So the heretics called Paulinians called
Catholics Romanists, as Euthimius testifies. So finally now a days
Catholics are by our Adversaries called Papists, and Romanists of the Pope and
Bishop of the Roman Church.

19. The sixth reason: the office of the true Church is to keep and mayntaine
the holy Scripture faithfully and continually. But our Adversaries can assign
noe other Church as keepers of the holy Scriptures besides the Roman Church.
Therefore it is only the true Church of God. For our Adversaries cannot say,
that they received the holy Scripture from heaven, not from any invisible and
unknown Calu. l. 1. Inst. c. 8. sect. 9. in fine.
Church, but from the visible Roman Church. Wherefore says Calvin, It is most
certain, that all the writings of the Prophets and Apostles came no otherwise
to all posterity, but as it were from hand to hand delivered unto us by the
ancient Fathers continually from year to year. Thus he. But none has
delivered the Bibles from hand to hand but the Roman Church. Wherefore it is as
certain that the Roman Church is the true Church of Christ, as that the holy
Scripture is true Scripture, seeing we do not know this which we have to be
true Scripture, but by the authority, tradition, and testimony of the Roman
Church.

20. Unto this, that also belongs Supr. c. 5. huius co^trouers.
which we have proved before, to wit, that the true Church does not only give a
bare testimony, but also sufficient authority to the Scriptures, for this the
only Roman Church and no other abounda^tly performs.

21. The seventh reason. The office of the true Church is to judge of all
controversies which do arise among Christians either in points of faith, or
other Ecclesiastical affairs. But to the Roman Church only, and to no other
besides, all controversies were brought which arose in the Church either in
faith or other Ecclesiastical matters. For unto this as to the seat Supr. c.
7. huius co^t*
of S. Peter, and the supreme Church, all had recourse who had any injury or
wrong done them. So S. Athanasius Patriarch of Alexandria, so Peter his
successor, so S. John Chrysostom Patriarch of Constantinople, and many others
did, of whom Bellarmine ^aron. To^. 3. 4. 5. 6. and 7. Calu. l 4. Inst. c. 8.
sect. 16.
and Baronius more at large: the which Calvin also cannot deny.

22. He^revnto also it belongs that the Roman Church has confirmed all
general Councels lawfully assembled, as Bellarmine declares, and Baronius
more Bellarm. l. 1. de Eccles* ^nilit. c. ^^. Baron. loc. cita^^^.
at large in every age.

23. The eight reason. The office of the true Church is to ordain and appoint
lawful Pastors and Ministers of the Sacraments, and to conserve always the
ordinary vocation as we also proved before. But our Adversaries can assign no
other Church but the Roman, which has always had this ordinary vocation, and
co^^inuall succession of Pastors, and the ordinary authority to send and
institute Pastors in the Church of God.

24. The ninth reason. The office of the true Church is to teach a true faith
without any error, so that in no one point Cap. 8. ^u. con^rou.
of doctrine necessary to salvation she may err, as we have already proved out
of holy Scripture. But our Adversaries can show no other Church besides the
Roman, Cap. 7. ^uius co^t.
which has not often erred in faith. Neither dare our Adversaries affirm that
Sand. d^ visibili Monar Eccles. pertotu^ l. 7. Bell. in quinque lib. d^ Romans
Po^tif. Coccius Tom. 1. l. 1. Artic. 11. and seq. Baron. per omnes 12. Tomos*
Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. ^ sect. 16. subfinem.
there is as yet among them any visible Church which cannot err in faith. But
Doctor Sanders, Bellarmine, Coccius, and Baronius do most evidently demonstrate
that the Roman Church never erred hitherto in doctrine concerning matters of
faith.

25. And here it is to be considered that in all other Churches founded by the
Apostles, yea in the Patriarks seats themselves, there have not been only
heresies but also many Archbishops heretics: but only the Roman Church among
them all has always been free and unstained with any heresy. The which Calvin
does plainly acknowledge when he writes, that the Roman Church in the time of
old heresies was not so troublesome as other Churches were, and that it kept
more exactly then the rest, the doctrine once delivered unto her by the
Apostles. But he badly as^r beth this to the power and strengeth of nature, or
to the generous disposition of the Romans, and not to the providence and grace
of God.

26. Much better did the ancient Bishops of Rome refer it to the singular
providence of God, and to the prayer of Christ of the which Christ himself
speaks Luc. 2^. v. 32.
when he says. But I have prayed for thee, Peter that thy faith fail not. And
indeed Bellarmine Bell l. 4. de Rom Pont. c. ^.
alleges seven ancient Bishops of Rome which attribute this to the prayer
of Christ.

27. The tenth reason. The proper and chiefest office of the true Church is to
bring men to their eternal salvation, so that without her help, or without
her we cannot hope to be saved, as we proved before by our Adversaries
doctrine. Supr. c 2. ^uiusco^t.
We ask therefore of them whether our predecessors who lived under the Bishops
of Rome these thousand years past were all damned or no? they dare not affirm
they were damned: but out of the true Church of God we cannot hope for
salvation: the Roman Church therefore wherein they lived and obtained their
salvation, is the true Church of Christ.

CHAP. V. By the signs of the true Church it is declared, that the Roman is
the true Church of Christ.
WE have declared out of the holy Scriptures that there Cap. 19. huius Controu.
are four most certain signs of the true Church of Christ, all which do
prove the Roman to be the same Church we speak of.

2. First, as concerning the unity of faith and doctrine; the Church of Rome
has the same faith in all and every particular point thereof with the primitive
Church, as also with that Church which has continued now for the space of
almost a thousand six hundred years, as Coccius clearly declares out of the
writings of all both ancient and late Histori^raphers, Coccius induobus Tom.
thesaur.
and that through every article ^ow in Controversy. And we will here^fter show
in every one of them the con^ent and harmony of the Roman Church with the
Scriptures and ancient Church. But on the other side among our Aduer^aries
there are many iarres and dissensions in points of Faith, every one of them
condemning another of heresy; as the forsaid Cocciu^ manifestly shows even by
Coccius Tom. 1. l. 8. Art. 7. 8. 9. and 10.
our Adversaries own writings: wherefore it is most manifest, that there is
perfect unity and agreement in the Roman Church concerning all matters of
faith, and that our Adversaries do differ and disagree almost in every article
thereof.

3. And here it is diligently to be considered that this does not happen unto
our Adversaries by a mere chance only, or by the malice of some few of them
as they say it does, but even necessarily out of the nature and condition of
their doctrine. For they teach, that there should be no Superior unto whom all
should be obedient and submit themselves: no judge of Controuersyes, whose
judgment and definition in those matters all should embrace or follow; besides
that every one teaches what he lists, and every one of them disdayneth to be
reprehended or corrected by another, whereby there must needs arise many iarres
and contentions among them.

4. But in the Roman Church it is far otherwise. For if there arise any
question or Controversy which can be desined and determined by the word of God,
presently the Church of Rome ends this Controversy, and forbids under
pain of excommunication any to teach the contrary; and by this means every
Controversy in matters of faith amongst Catholics is forthwith ended. But if
the matter be obscure and cannot easily be gathered out of the word of God, nor
be very necessary to salvation, then the Roman Church commands both parties
that one of them do not condemn the others opinion, as we see practiced
concerning the Conception of the B. Virgin Mary. And in this manner all matters
of Controversy are ended and taken away. Vide Conc. Trid. sect. 5. post Canon.
5.
The Lutherans being convinced by ^his argument do acknowledge that the ^opes
Supremacy is very profitable and ne^essary for the Church for the preservation
^f this unity and good agreement in all ^inges, as a little after we will
euident^ Infr. cap. 24.. 4. and sequent. Coccius l. ^. ^itato Art. 11. idem
^od^ lib. Ar. 12. 13. 14.
demonstrate out of their own wri^ngs.

5. Secondly, as concerning the san^tity and holiness of the Church, Coccius
^eclareth very well and briefly, that even from the very first beginning till
now ^^re have always been some holy and ^^dly persons in the Church of Rome.
Yea that also there never wanted so^^ Calu. co^c. 10. Gall. in Epist. ad Ephesians.
co^c. 10. in cap. 11. Epist. 1. ad Cor. and con c. 9. sub. fin. in 1. ad Tim.
who did very strange and miraculous things. Moreover in the same places he
proves manifestly the great impiety and wickedness of our Adversaries, and
that there were never any true miracles wrought by any of them. Yea Calvin
himself does often confess and acknowledge the dishonesty and wickedness of
his followers to be very great.

6. That it cannot most certainly be the true Church of Christ which
altogether is destitute of the gift of miracles, sufficiently appears by
those words of Christ: These signs shall follow those tha^ Marc. vlt. c. 17.
and 18.
believe, in my name they shall cast out Diuell^ they shall speak with new
tongues, ser^ents shall they take away, and if they drink any deadly things,
it shall not hurt them: they shall impose hands upon the sick, and they shall be
whole. And that this promise of Christ is not only to be restrained to the
Apostles time we must needs confess, unless we will say that the authority to
preach the Gospel, and to administer the Sacraments of Baptism (the which
are contained in the same promise) did only appertain to the Apostles time.
But that the Sa^nts of God which lived in the Roman Church have done all those
miracles which Christ recounteth in the foresaid place is manifest by that which
Cocc. art. 13. citat.
Coccius relates of them.

7. But here it is diligently to be considered, that the impiety or lack of
all holiness in our Adversaries is not casual, or accidentary unto them, as
it is with us, that i^, flowing from the malice of man, but it proceeds out
of the very doctrine of our Aduesaries. For they teach, that none can truly
have their sins forgiven them, that none can have any true holiness before
God, that none can have any freewill to do good works, that noe work of a
just man ca^ be perfect or meri^^rio^^ before God; that all things as well the
bad as the good are done by a certain necessary predestination of God, that
noe satisfaction for our sins is necessary, that we need not confess our
sins, that good works are not necessary to salvation and life everlasting,
that Gods commandments are impossible, and such other paradoxes, whereof we
will speak more hereafter. All which do vehemently incite and stir up men
to all sin and iniquity. But on the other side, the whole doctrine of the
Roman Church inflameth continually the hearts of men with the love of virtue and
the exercise of good works.

8. Thirdly, the Roman Church may truly be called Catholic, and that it is no
less Catholic now, then it was in the time of the ancient holy Fathers, both
we have sufficiently declared before, and Thomas Boz^u^ proves at large. For
albeit S^prac. 10. huius Cont.. 14. Bozius de sign^s Eccles.
the Roman faith may seem to have failed in some place of Europ, yet
notwithstanding it has meruailously increased and still daily increases in
Asia, Africa and those wide countries of the East and West Indies. But it is
certain, that our Adversaries Churches are wholly destitute of this mark and
sign.

9. Finally that the Roman Church may truly be called Apostolical, it
appears sufficiently by the continual succession of Pastors, ever since S.
Peter's time to Paul the fifth, who is now the supreme Pastor of the Roman
Church. The which succession Cocc. l. 8. citat. art. 2.
is briefly related by Coccius, but our Adversaries can never show the like.

10. And Calvin cannot deny, but that those holy Fathers Ir^naeus, Augustine,
Calu. l. 4. instit. c. 2. Sect. ^. subfinem.
Optatus, and many others disputing with old heretics used this argument, the
which is deduced from the continual succession of the Popes of Rome. But,
says he, they did so because till their time there was nothing of the doctrine
delivered unto them by the Apostles, changed at Rome. Neither as yet is there
any of that doctrine changed which was at Rome in S. Augustines time, and
besides the same succession Calu. ^. ^. cit. sect. 2.
continues still. For we do not say, as they falsely slander us, that the
succession only of persons without true doctrine is sufficient, but we urge a
continual succession, as well of persons, as of doctrine, seeing that no
doctrine can consist, or remain without those persons which teach it.

CHAP. VI. That the Church of the City of Rom^ is the chiefest of all the
visible Churches of Christ, is clearly convinced by the holy Scriptures.
BESIDES those arguments hitherto alleged out of the properties, offices, and
signs of the true Church, whereby we have proved the Roman Church to be the
true Church of Christ, there are some other reasons which may be deduced out of
holy Scriptures, whereof see Bellarmine and Sanders: Bell. and Sa^der. locis
citat supr. cap. 2^.. 27. in fi^e.
we according to our accustomed breuity will only bring two principal places
for this purpose, whereby it is manifestly declared, that the Roman Church is
not only the true Church, but that also, that which is now in Rome is more
eminent and famous then all other Churches of Christ, as the successor of S.
Peter the Prince of the Apostles is there resident, and governs the same, as
the supreme head thereof.

2. The first place is taken out of S. Mat. 15. v. 18. and 19.
Matthew. For he relates the words which Christ spoke to S. Peter, which are
these: And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I
build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I
will give to thee the keys of the Kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou
shall bind upon earth, it shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shall
loose on earth, it shall be loosed in heaven.

3. First that Christ spoke to S. Peter and not to the other Apostles,
appears evidently by the very words of the text. For Io. 1. v. 24. and Joan
22. v. 15.
first of all Christ sets down S. Peter's old name: Simon, says he, thou
art blessed, and then afterward he sets down the name of his father
Ba^-iona, that is to say, the son of Jonas, or of John, as also the
Evangelist S. John testifyeth. He shows afterward that the revelation was
only made to S. Peter. My father, says he, has revealed unto thee: he does
not say, unto you, as he is wo^^ to say when he speaks unto them all. He
adds moreover, because thou art Peter, which certainly agrees only to S.
Peter: for upon him only was this Name imposed, Joan. 1. v. 42.

4. Moreover Christ adds, And upon this rock I will build my Church, in
which words that particle ( and) is a conjunction causall and not a copulative,
and it signifies because: and in this sense it is used oftentimes in holy
Scripture, as our Adversaries cannot deny, as for example in that place of
Genesis: Lo thou shall dye for the woman Genesis 20. v. 3. Psalm. 59. ve^ 60. v.
13. 107. Psa vel 08 v. 13. Isaiae 46. v. vlt. Luc. 1. v. 42.
that thou have taken, and has a husband, that is, because she has a husband.
So also David in his Psalms: Give us thy help from our tribulation, and vain
is the salvation of men, that is to say, because the salvation of men is but
vain. In like manner the Prophet Isay says, Behold thou art angry, and we
have sinned, that is to say, because we have sinned. In the same sense it is
used in the new Testament: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, that is to say, because it is blessed, as Calvin and Beza
do acknowledge: all which places Calvin confesses to be so understood after
Theophilact. Also, and none gave him any thing, that is to say, because none
gave him. See more examples of this in the latin edition.

5. This therefore is the true sense of that place, As thou have said unto me,
thou Joan. 1. v. 42.
art Christ the Son of the living God, so, I say unto thee, that I have
worthily called thee Peter, because upon this rock, which thou art, I will
build my Church. For to what end should Christ have said unto him, thou art
Peter, seeing that all knew well enough before, that Peter was Peter, but that
he would thereby declare that he was not called Peter without great cause, that
is to say, because upon him, as upon a sure and strong foundation and rock,
Christ intended to build his Church. Christ therefore Joan. 1. v. 42.
would have S. Peter to remember the name which of late was given him, and
afterward he assigns the reason and S. Hier. in c. 16. Matt. sup. eaverba
Quiatu es Petrus:
cause why he called him so, to wit, because upon him, as upon a most strong
rock he would build his Church. According to the metaphore os a rock, says
S. Hierome, it was rightly said unto him: I will build my Church upon thee.

6. For the holy Scripture is accustomed when it speaks of a name given unto
any by the interpretation of the word, to adioyne also the reason and Genesis 17.
v. 5 Genesis 22. v. 27. Genesis 4. v. 25.
cause of the name: so said our Lord unto Abram: Neither shall thy name be
called any more Abram, but thou shall be called Abraham, and then he presently
gives a reason taken from the etimology of the word, because a Father of many
Nations I have made thee. So also he did when Jacob was called Israel. See more
of this in the Latin edition, page 280.

7. Lastly not without great reason Christ gave unto S. Peter this new name,
but no other cause is assigned in the holy Scripture but this, Because upon
this rock I will build my Church. This therefore and no other was the cause of
giving him this new name. Hereupon says S. Hilary very well. O happy
foundation of Christ's Church, says he, in the imposition of a new name! and o
In c. 16. Matt.
worthy rock of that building, the which should dissolve and break the
infernal Laws, the gates of hell, and all the strong bars of death! So S.
Hilary.

8. Moreover Christ said to S. Peter, I will give the keys of the Kingdom of
heaven unto thee, he does not say, unto you. In like manner he said in the
singular number, Mat. 16. v. 19.
whatsoever thou have bound upon earth etc. that thou shall loose etc. He spoke
therefore to S. Mat. 18. v. 18.
Peter only, and not to many.

9. And albeit he promised this last authority of bynding or loosing men from
their sins to the other Apostles also, yet first of all in this place he
promised this to S. Peter alone, and then afterward to the rest, to the end
we might thereby know, that he made S. Peter the head of all the rest, and that
all their power and authority was subordinate to that of his. For at this day
all Catholic Bishops have authority to bynd and loose, but subordinate to the
Popes authority.

10. All which things that holy martyr S. Cyprian declares very well in Cypr.
de unit. Ecc. circa principium. Mat. 16. v. 18. and 19.
these words, whereby it may easily be understood what was the opinion and
judgment of the primitive Church concerning this matter. God speak^th unto S.
Peter, says S. Cyprian, I say unto thee, because thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my Church etc. And again after his resurrection Joan. 20.
v. 20. 21. 22. and 23.
he said, feed my sheep: upon him alone he buyldeth his Church, and he
commits unto him to feed his sheep; and albeit he gave the like authority
to all the other Apostles, saying: As my Father sent me, so etc. whose sins
ye forgive etc. yet to the end he might show and declare an unity, he ordained
but one chair, and he confirmed by his authority the beginning of that unity
proceeding from one. The same indeed, or equal in all other things were the
other Apostles with S. Peter, endued with the same power and authority (to wit,
before those words of Christ to S. Peter, feed my sheep) but the beginning
proceeded from unity. The primacy was given to S. Peter, to the end that one
Church of Christ, and one chair might be made manifest and known. Hitherto S.
Cyprian.

11. But now that these promises of Christ did not only belong to the person of
S. Peter, but also to all those who were to succeed him in the same office till
the end of the world, we do thus clearly prove, and demonstrate. First because
S. Peter is here made the foundation of the Church, and the rock whereupon it
is builded: but the Church of Christ always remains, therefore the foundation
thereof must always remain, seeing that nothing can continue, and be without it
foundation.

12. Moreover those keys which were given to S. Peter do remain always in
the Church, as all our Adversaries confess: Ergo, he also remains to whom
these keys were given. For that authority, or those keys were not given for
S. Peter alone, but for the Church which is always extant. It therefore always
retayneth those keys, and that authority of bynding or loosing men from their
sins in S. Peter, and his successors, till the end of the world.

13. And this is that which S. Leo S. Leo Sermon* ^. ina^niu. assump. suae ad
Pontif.
says when he writes, that S. Peter even to this day governs the Church of
God, that is to say, by his successors insomuch that his dignity never fails
even in an unworthy successor. But hitherto there was never any successor of S.
Peter acknowledged in the Church of Christ, besides the Bishop of Rome. He
therefore is the only successor of S. Peter and the supreme Bishop of the
Church. And the Roman is not only the true Church of Christ, but also perferred
before all others even by Christ himself.

14. The second place is, Feed my la^bes, Joan. 21. v. 15. 16. and 17. Eusebius.
Emissen. Sermon in natiu. S. Joan. Euang.
feed my sheep. In which words God commended to S. Peter not only his lambs,
which signifies the common sort of people, but also his sheep, to wit, the
Pastors and Fathers of his Church. First says Eusebius Emissenus, he committed
to S. Peter his lambs* and then his sheep* because he made him not only a
Pastor, but the Pastor of Pastors. Peter therefore feeds the lambs, and also
the sheep. He feeds children and their mothers, he rules Bern. de consi^er.
ad Euge^. l. ^. c. 8. S. Leo Sermon. 3. de assump. sua ad Pontif. Joan. 21. v. 15.
the people and their Prelates* He is therefore the Pastor of all, because
besides lambs and sheep there is nothing in the Church. Hitherto Eusebius.
And S. Bernard: My sheep, says Christ: Unto whom is it not ^layne and
manifest that he did not assign some but all nothing is excepted where there
is no distinction made. Thus S. Bernard. And S. Leo: Peter does properly
govern all, whom principally Christ also governs.

15. Furthermore it is manifest that these words were spoken to S. Peter and
not to the other Apostles, seeing that Christ asked him thrice: Do thou love
me? And moreover he added, more then these, that he might make a manifest
distinction betwixt S. Peter, and the other Apostles.

16. Finally it is most certain, that this promise of Christ does not only
appertain to the person of S. Peter, but also to his successors which are to
remain in the Church till the end of the world. Ephesians. 4. v 11. Calu. and Beza
ib. Confess. Rupell. Art. 25.
For both the Apostle does plainly testify and our Adversaries do also confess
that the office of a Pastor is ordinary, and shall always continue, and be in
the Church of God.

17. And the chiefest reason thereof is, because we stand in no less need now
of a supreme Pastor, then they which were in the primitive Church, while^ yet
the Apostles were alive, yea we have much more need thereof: besides that there
are still and always shall be some sheep of Christ, therefore there shall also
still continue their chief Pastors. The Rom^n Church therefore is not only the
true Church of Christ, but also that wherein S. Peter's successor, and the
supreme Pastor of the whole Church of Christ remains.

18. But these two places are so manifest, that they cannot be confuted or
wrested to any other sense, unless we till reduce all words to a
metaphorical signification, or other figurative speeches, the which is a
common trick of our Adversaries when they are urged with plain words of the
holy scripture. But against all these falsifications of our Adversaries we must
always observe that rule of the S. Aug. tom. 3. de doctrine. Christi. l. 3.
cap. 1^.
Catholic Church taken out of S. Augustine: to wit, that we must never depart
from the proper signification of the words of holy Scripture, unless we be
forced by the authority of some more evident point of faith, whereunto the
proper signification of the words do manifestly repugne. For otherwise if we
might, as often as we would, refuse and l^aue the proper signification of the
words, there will be nothing less certain in all the holy Scripture.

19. Moreover it will be an easy matter for every one to fly to metaphors and
improper significatio^s when he is pressed with the plain words of holy
Scripture: but there is nothing here that should force us to depart from the
true and proper sense of the words. None therefore but desperate and careless
of their own salvation will give credit and b^lieue these foolish toys and
dreams of our Adversaries, invented only by them in hatred and contempt of the
Bishop of Rome.

20. Yea he will rather embrace and follow the uniform consent and
understanding of the ancient Fathers and of all the whole Church. For the holy
Fathers in many places do affirm that these Bellar. l. 1. de Romans Pont. c. 10
and 14. Coccius To. 1. l. 7. Art. 4.
two places of the holy Scripture are to be understood literally of Saint
Peter; the which Bellarmine and Coccius have diligently gathered together, as
many other Catholic Authors have done before them. But because this matter is
so clear and manifest that even our Adversaries cannot deny it, as we will
plainly show in the next Chapter, we will not now spend any more time in
alleging of Authors.

21. But our Adversaries do here cry out, and object against us, that the
holy Fathers do sometimes affirm, that the Church was built upon the faith of
S. Peter, and sometimes upon his confession. As though (forsooth) there were
any among us so foolish as to think that the Church was built upon S. Peter's
back or shoulders, or upon S. Peter as he was an Infidel, or dumme, and not
rather upon S. Peter as endued and replenished with the gift of faith,
confessing and professing openly the mysteries thereof. Wherefore it is all one,
whether we say, that the Church is built upon S. Peter, or upon his faith and
confession, for we do not separate S. Peter from his faith, or from the public
profession thereof, but we only affirm that the Church of Christ was built upon
the faith and confession of S. Peter alone, and of no other.

22. And hence it is, that the same holy Fathers who in some places affirm
that the Church was built upon the faith and confession of S. Peter, do else
where S. Epiph. contra Haeres. 50. quae est Catharoru^. Chryso^st. Ho^. 55. in.
Mat. S. Aug. Tom 1. l. retractat. cap. 21.
plainly testify that it was built upon S. Peter himself. Yea even in the same
place they sometimes say, that it was built upon the faith or confession of S.
Peter, and sometimes upon S. Peter himself, as appears by S. Epiphanius, and
S. Chrysostom.

23. We know also very well that S. Augustine in some places understood by this
word ( Rock) Christ himself, but he does not reject the common exposition of
other holy Fathers: yea he confirms the same by the authority of S. Ambrose,
and he testifies himself that he held that opinion in other places. For they
are not to be reprehended but rather to be greatly commended, who attribute
many litterall senses to the same words of the holy Scripture, so that they do
not reject and condemn the common and approved sense of the whole Church, as
we have already declared out of S. Augustine. Contro. 1. c. 15.. 7. and seq.


24. Truly even our Adversaries themselves confess, that the foresaid
exposition of S. Augustine is both forced and harsh in it self. For seeing
that neither in the words of Christ which go before, nor in the confession it
self of S. Peter, there is any mention made of a rock, the particle ( this)
cannot demonstrate that which is not in Calu. ad haec verba S. Mat. in sua
harmonia. Beza inc* 16. Mat. ad v. 18.
the whole sentence, but violently. Wherefore our Adversaries leaving this
exposition of S. Augustine, they understand by the rock, either the faith of S.
Peter, as Calvin does, or with Beza his confession. And they both confess,
that the word Cepha in the Syriacke tongue is the same in both places, when
Christ says, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock, and the Greek word also
(...), and (...) do only differ in their terminations, and not in substance.

25. But albeit Calvin commends Calu^. loco citato.
that deriuatio^ of the word Peter which S. Augustine sets down, to wit,
that Petrus is named of Petr^, as Christianus of Christo: yet Beza loco citato.
Beza writes more truly, that Christ speaking in the Syriake tongue used no
deriuation of names, but said Cepha in both places. Our Adversaries therefore
do not well to object S. Augustines exposition against us, the which they
themselves acknowledge not to be the litterall sense of the words.

CHAP. VII. That the Church of Rome is the chiefest and head of all other, is
proved out of the ancient Fathers, and even by the confession of our
Adversaries themselves.
THE ancient holy Fathers do not only with uniform consent affirm the Roman
to be the true Church of Christ, but also that it is the chiefest and most
principal Church of all: in so much that they affirm it to be the head of the
whole visible Church of Christ: and many other things they do write in the
praise and commendation of the Roman Church, and of the Pope the supreme Pastor
thereof, as may evidently be seen in Catholic writers Bell. l. 2. de Romans
pont. c. 13. and seq. Co^c. To^. 1 l. 7. art. 5. 6. and 7.
which are related by Bellarmine and Coccius. We for breuity sake will only
allege two of the holy Fathers, by whom it may easily be gathered what was the
judgment and opinion of the rest concerning this matter.

2. The first is that most ancient holy S. Irenaeus who lived even in the
Apostles S. Iren. l. ^. adu^rs. haeres. cap. 3.
time. Because, says he, it would be too long to recount in this volume the
succession of all Churches, we proposing the tradition and ^ayth of the
greatest, most ancient and best known Church, founded by the two glorious
Apostles Peter and Paul, which by preaching and succession of Bishops has
descended even from the Apostles to us, do confound all those who by any means
gather any thing contrary to that they should, either by their own foolish
fancies or by vain glory, or by the great blindness of their understanding,
or following any badde opinion. For all other Churches, that is to say, all
faithful true belieuers threughout the whole world, must needs come unto this
Church by reason of the most potent principality thereof. Hitherto are the
words of S. Irenaeus. And afterward he recounteth the succession of all the
Popes of Rome till S. Aug. Tom. 9. ^ tract. 56. in Euang. S. Joan.
his time.

3. The other is S. Augustine, whom our Adversaries also esteem very much.
Who knows not, says he that blessed S. Peter was the chief and head of all
the Apostles? Thus S. August. Tom. 2. Epist. 162. ad Episc. Donatistaru^.
S. Augustine of S. Peter. But speaking of the Church of Rome, he says: In the
Roman Church has always flourished the chief power and authority of the
Apostolical chair. If we beli^ue S. Augustine, nothing is more clear and
manifest.

4. But it is not necessary to cite any more places of the holy Fathers. For
even our Adversaries confess that this was the common opinion of all the
ancient Fathers Bucerus in praeparator. ad Council.
concerning this matter. Thus writes Martin Bucer sometimes Caluins master
and chief Patron, not only in his own name, but also of all the Lutheranes:
We confess plainly with all ^ur hearts, says he, that among the ancient
Fathers of the Church, the Church of Rome has always obtained the chiefest
authority and supremacy above all others, because it has the chair of S.
Peter, and whose Bishops have always been accounted the successors of S. Peter.
Thus Bucer.

5. And Calvin albeit he inueigheth bitterly against the Church of Rome, yet
constrained to speak truth, writes in Calu. l. 4. Inst it. c. ^ sect. 16.
this manner: I will first say this aforehand, that I deny not but that the old
writers do every where give great honor to the Church of Rome, and do speak
reverently of it. And a little after he says thus. For that same opinion which
I wot not how was grown in force, that it was founded Calu. l. 4. Instit. c.
7. sect. 11. Verba istornm actor. cicantur ab ab ipsis Luth. in l. colloq.
Al^ing. Extant etia^ apud Sand. l. 1. de ^ustif. cap. 1. De Smalcald. articul.
and Philippi subscript. habetur ibid. a facult. VVitte^b. edito co^tra G^so.
Peuceru^ an 1597. in princ c. 6. fol. 60. p. 1.
and ordained by the ministry of Peter, much auailed to procure favor and
estimation unto it. Therefore in the west parts it was for honors sake called
the Sea Apostolic. And in another place. I grant, says he* that there
remain also true Epistles of the old Bishops, wherein they set forth the
honor of their sea with glorious titles, of which sort are some Epistles of
Leo.

6. But the Lutherans in their Synodicall acts do acknowledge that eue^ in the
time of the first Council of Nice, and in the days of S. Cyprian, S. Hierome,
and S. Augustine the Pope of Rome had the chief supremacy, the which say they,
we willingly admit and embrace to increase the good agreement in faith piety
and Ecclesiastical policy, for they very well pe^ceiued that this supremacy of
the Pope of Rome did avail much to keep unity and concord in doctrine and
Ecclesiastical policy.

7. And hence it is, that the said Lutheranes in their articles agreed upon at
Smalcalde, the which they made in the year 1537. to be exhibited to the
general Council which was reported to be holden at Mantua, among other
articles they approved this of the Popes authority, and unto these Philip
Melancthon also subscribed. Who also afterward in the year 1548. far more
evidently approved the Popes authority, witing thus in his Epistle to the Lord
Habe^tur ista eod^ c. 6. fol. 7. page 1.
Ambassador Theophilus. Besides these, says he, we reverently honor and
worship the authority of the Roman Bishop, and all Ecclesiastical policy, so
that the Bishop of Rome do not reject us. Thus Philip in that place.

8. But what was the most true opinion of Melancthon concerning this matter
appears more evidently by a certain epistle he wrote in the year 1535. of
the Extat integra ista Epist. Philip. i^ ce^t. Epist. Theol. ad Io.
S^hunehelium ministr u^ Bipo^tinu^ est quam ista Epist. inter caeteras ordine
74. iuxta ed^ Bipont. Anno 1597.
Ecclesiastical iarres, and the agreement which was made concerning the
articles in controversy, wherein he alleges some reasons for the Popes
Supremacy. These are Philippes words speaking of some of his who did hinder
and resist the agreement which was to be made with Catholics. Some of them,
says he, do think that nothing else is demanded, but that having shaken of
the Popes Monarchy, and rejecting all the old Ecclesiastical ordinances, a
certain Barbarous liberty should be established. And a little after. Ours do
grant that the Ecclesiastical policy is a thing very lawful in it sel^l, that
is to say, even as there are some Bishops who have charge, or rule diverse
Churches: so also the Pope of Rome exceeds all other Byshopes in authority.
This Canonical policy, as I think, no wise man either can or should reject, if
he desire to keep himself within his own limits. And again. As concerning
the riches and revenues they are the liber all and magnificent gystes of
Kings and Princes. Wherefore as concerning this ar^^cle of the Popes
supremacy, and the authority of other Bishopes, there is no Controversy among
us. For both the Pope of Rome may easily retain his authority and the other
Bishops may also keep theirs. And there must needs be some governors in the
Church of God; who may ordain those which are called to Ecclesiastical
offices, and may exercise the authority of the said Church in all Judicial and
diffi^ulte matters, as also may examine the doctrine of the Priests thereof.
And that if there were no such Bishops, yet there should be such ordained for
that purpose. And a little after. That Monarchy of the Pope is very good in my
judgment and necessary, to the end that the vn^forme good agreement in doctrnie
may be kept in many Nations. Wherefore perfect good agreement in this one
article concerning the Popes supremacy may easily be established, if they could
once agree about other articles. Hitherto Philip.

9. Much like unto these wrote Martin Bucer by the consent of Capito, Hedio,
and Niger his confederates of the Church of Bezain vita Ca u. Anno. 1568. s^^b
finem.
Argentine, who were as Beza says, great fauorits of Calum. For in the same
Century of Epistles there is one extant with this title: Martin Bucer does
testify his agreement in all things with Philip Mela^cthon, both in his own
name, and of the whole Church of Argentine. And this Epistle of Centur. Epist.
Schuneb. Epist. 75.
Bucer is next unto the foresaid Epistle of Philip Melancthon.

10. Moreover in this very Epistle when Bucer treats of this Ecclesiastical
Monarchy (the which he calls Policy) he writes thus. But we desire nothing
less then that the Kingdom of Christ should want her policy or authority to
command. No where should things be done in better and more certain order, no
where should the obedience be greater, the subjection more perfect, the
reverent respect of authority more religiously observed. But now the outward
power whatsoever it be, is of God, and he resists Gods ordination, who is not
obedient unto this. Finally toward the end of the same Epistle, thus he
concludes. We will therefore in no sort hinder the small and perfect
agreement of Churches. The Pope of Rome and all the other Bishops may lawfully
keep their authority, yea and their dominations also; let them use their
authority only to the edification, and not to the destruction of the Church:
seeing that there is no authority at all the whith we do not account holy, and
we teach the same unto them. We seek for nothing so diligently as for the
discipline of the Church. Hitherto Bucer with his companions, who did evidently
foresee, that neither any good agreement in doctrine* nor Ecclesiastical
discipline can continue any long time without one supreme head and Monarch of
the v^sible Church.

11. Finally now also, as many of our Adversaries as have any experience in
matters of Policy, and are well affected toward the monarchy of Kings and
Princes do willingly acknowledge that there must needs be one supreme Bishop
in the Church of God, and that this is to be ^ustly granted to the Pope of
Rome, if we could once agree among our selves about other matters in
Controversy. For they see very well, that all those arguments whereby the
monarchy of secular Kings and Princes is established do prove in the same
manner also the Ecclesiastical Monarchy. And on the other side all those
arguments which do impugue the Ecclesiastical Monarcy do no less overthrow
the temporal Monarchy of all Christian Kings and Princes.

CHAP. VIII. Wherein the arguments of our Adversaries against the Church of
Rome are confuted.
THese are the chiefest arguments which our Adversaries do object against us
ou^ of holy Scripture. The first* Christ is the head of the Church, the rock
and foundation, besides Cor. 11. v. 3.
which no man can lay any other. I answer, that of one and the same thing
there may be many heads, so that one be subject to another. For the head of
the woman is the man, the head of every man is Christ, and the head of Christ
is God, as the Apostle testifies. And so the woman has three heads, her
Husband, Christ, and God; but each one of them is subject unto another. So S.
Peter or the Pope of Rome is the head of the Church, but under Christ, and
subject unto him. Because Christ is the head Ephesians. 1. v. 22.
of S. Peter, and of the Bishop of Rome Moreou^r Christ is the head of the
whole Church, ^swell present as to come, as well of the old Testament, as of
oath new. But S. Peter or his successor is only head of the Church in this
world, and of the new Testament only. Hereupon said Matt. 16. v. 18.
Christ, upon this rock I will build my Church, that is to say, the Church of
the new Testament which was then to be built.

2. Yea even by the nature of a head we way gather very well that besides
Christ, who is the head of all Churches as well visible as invisible, as the
Apostle says, there is also another visible head of Ephesians. 1. v. 22.
the visible Church, for otherwise it were a monster, because it should be a
visible body without a visible head. Yt is necessary therefore, that besides an
invisible head which is Christ, there be also a visible head in the visible
Church, to wit, S. Peter's successor.

3. Furthermore the actions which Christ exercises in his Church are of two
kinds, some are invisible as our vocation, justification and sanctification
etc. and these Christ exercises and does by himself. Some other actions are
visible, as to preach, administer Sacraments, and to govern visibly the Church
etc. These Christ does not exercise by himself alone, but also by visible men
which represent his person. Wherefore even as Christ should not be said, truly
to baptize any unless there were some visible man who in the person of Christ
should visibly baptize: neither can he be said truly to govern visibly every
particular Church, unless in each of them some particular person do visibly
govern in Christ's steed: so also neither should Christ be said truly to
govern visibly the whole Church, unless there were some one who in his person
migh visibly govern the whole Church. But this person can be no other but the
Bishop of Rome.

4. And that which has been said 1. Cor. 3. v. ^1.
before of the h^ad, is also to be understood of the rock and foundation. For
Christ is indeed the chiefest foundation of all true belieuers: but the
secondary Ephesians. 2. ^. 20.
and subordinate foundation unto Christ is also the doctrine of the Apostles
and Prophets, as the Apostle expressly says to the Ephesians: and Calvin also
acknowledges it to be most true. But if the doctrine Calu. ibid. and l. 1.
Inst cap. 7. sect. 2.
of all the Apostles be also the foundation of the Church, why should not also
S. Peter's doctrine be the same. For when we say that S. Peter is the foundation
of the Church, by S. Peter we do understand not his person only but also his
doctrine preached in the Church of Rome.

5. Moreover seeing that S. John in his Apocalypse says, that the City of God
has Apocal. 21. v. 14
twelve foundations, and in them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the
lamb: What marvel is it, if S. Peter the first of the Apostles be called a
rock, or foundation of the City of God.

6. And here it is to be considered, that when the Apostle says, that there
is no other foundation besides Christ, this word ( besides) has the same
signification 1. Cor. v. 11.
that contrary or against has, as appears by many other places of holy
Scripture. For otherwise all the Apostles are called the foundations of the
Church, as we have said before: but they are not contrary or against Christ,
but under Supra cap. 35.. 2. Cotr. 1.
Christ, and subject unto him.

7. Finally if we examine more exactely the true sense of those words of S.
Paul to the Corinthians, it will appear manifestly, 1. Contr. 3. v. 11.
that our Adversaries wrest the said words of the Apostle to a contrary sense
and meaning. For the Apostle does not speak of the foundation of the whole
building of the Church of Christ whereof ^. Cor. 3. v. 11.
only is our present Co^trouersy: but of the foundation of particular and
private actions of every true belieuer. For S. Paul manifestly writes, that he
laid that foundotion whereof he speaks, and that every one builds his own
proper work upon this foundation. But there is a great difference among these
foundations: because here Christ himself is the who made and ordained S.
Peter to be a foundation. I say Matt. 16. v. 18.
unto thee, says Christ to S. Peter, that thou art Cephas: there S. Paul is he
who ^oga^^er said that foundation whereof he speaks: as a wise work master,
says he, have I laid the 1 Cor. 3. v. ^0.
foundation. Here Christ himself is ^e who builds, Upon this rock, says
our Lord, I will buyld. There every private man is he who buyldeth, but let
every one look, says the Apostle, how he builds thereon; here Matt. 16. v.
18.
the Church is that which is built thereon, I will build, says our Lord my
Church. There the work of every private man is that which is built thereon. If
any man's work abide, says the Apostle, that which he built 1. Cor. 3. v. 14.
thereupon shall receive reward* S. Paul therefore speaks of the foundation of
good works which belong unto justice and life everlasting, whereof as we have
said, Christ is the ^^ ^huius cap.
only foundation. We treat here of the founddation of the outward and visible
government of the Church and doctrine of sound faith. Now S. Peter and his
successors were such a foundation. Wherefore that which our Adversaries allege
out of S. Paul, does nothing concern this our present disputation.

8. The second argument. S. Peter denied Joan. 18. v. 25.
Christ thrice, therefore be could not be the rock against whom the gates of
hell should never prevail. I answer that when S. Peter denied Christ, he was
not as then the foundation of the Church. For promise was made unto him only
Matthew. 16. I will build etc. I will give thee etc. speaking always in the
future tense: but afterward Joan. 21. the authority was Joan. 21. v. 15.
actually given which was before promised unto him, and that after that denial
of S. Peter, as also after the resurrection of Christ, feed my lambs, says
Christ, feed my sheep.

9. The third argument. After that the foresaid authority was given Joan. 21. S.
Peter was reprehended by S. Paul Gal. 2. I answer that, as witnesses
Tertullian the Tertull. l. 5. centra. Ma^ci. c. 3. Tertull. de praesc. aduersus
Haeret. c. 23. infine.
Marcionists objected this very same place against Catholics, unto whom
Tertullian answers in these words. Indeed says he* it was a vice or fault of
his conversation, and not of his preaching. And he answered very well; for S.
Peter might peradventure the^ have svnned, but he could not err in faith,
because he knew very well that the Moysaicall Law was not necessary to
salvation for the Gentills, neither did he ever teach the same to be necessary.
Yea when there arose any controversy about this matter, he manifestly taught
that the Gentills were not obliged by it, as may be seen in the Acts of the
Apostles. Wherefore if S. Peter offended in any thing, it was a sin of his
Act. 15. v. 10. and 11 ^ell. l. 1. de Ro^. Pont. c. vlt. infine* Baron. Tom. 1.
an. 5*. and 52. ^ seq. 1 Cor. 1 v. 13. 1. Cor. 1. v. 13.
conversation and not of his preaching and doctrine, whereof we now only
dispute, albeit there are many who think that S. Peter did not offend at all
in any respect: of whom see Bellarmine, and Baronius.

10. The fourth argument. S. Paul reprehended those that said they belonged to
S. Peter. I answer that those men divided Christ from S. Peter and S. Paul,
and they opposed them against Christ as eqalls unto him, making them as it were
so many Christ's: The which S. Paul declares in these words, Is Christ
divided? Moreover they attributed to S. Peter and S. Paul the internal and
invisible gifts of 1. Cor. 1. v. 13
the holy Ghost, and the effect of the Sacrament, yea and our redemption also,
no otherwise then they did unto Christ. Hence are those words of S. Paul in
the same place, why? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the
name of Paul?

11. But we teach that the Pope of Rome is inferior, and not equal unto
Christ: whereupon he is also called the Vicar of Christ, as subject unto him,
and not divided from him. Moreover we teach that the Pope does not give the
inward and spiritual gifts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, but he is only the
Vicar of Christ in the doctrine of faith and exterior government of the
Church.

12. The first argument. The Apostle to the Corinthians, and Ephesians does
recount diverse offices of the Church* and 1. Cor. 1. v. 18. E^bes. 4. v. 11.
yet he says nothing of S Peter. I answer first, that it is not necessary
that the Apostle make any mention of S. Peter in every place, for it is
sufficient that in some one place or other he has evidently declared that S.
Peter was a chief member of the Church the which he did when he said, that he
came to Jerusalem to see S. Peter, and tarryed with him fifteen Gal. 1 v. 18.
days.

13. Furthermore in these very places he manifestly makes mention of S. Peter.
For every where he puts the Apostles in the first place, and all Christians
knew well enough, that S. Peter was chief of all the apostles* according to
that of S. Matthew, the first Simon, who was called Peter. Here upon says S.
Augustine* who knows* not that S. Peter was the chief of the Apostles?

14. Finally the Apostle himself does not indeed speak in these places of the
ordinary Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, but of those extraordinary gifts which
were given to the members of the primitive Church. For he recounteth there also
the Eu^ngelists, Prophets, the grace of doing cures or helps, kinds of
tongues etc. which are certainly extraordinary gifts, as S. Chr^sostome,
Theophilactus, Oecumenius, and others expounding these words of the Apostle,
have well noted.

15. The sixth argument. Many of the Bishops of Rome were wicked bad men, and
given to many kinds of sins, as all, even Catholic writers do testify. As
therefore they have grievously erred in manners, so they might also err in
faith and doctrine. I answer, that this was S. Aug. Tom. 2. Epist. 165. ad
Gener. and To^. 7. co^tr literas Petil. Donatist. ^ib 2. c. 5. 6. and 51.
in times past the argument of the Donatists against Catholics, whereunto S.
Augustine has often answered. For there is a great difference betwixt their
conversation and doctrine, because an error committed in our manner of
conversation only hurts him which erreth, but an error in doctrine is also
hurtful to many others* yea even to the whole Church of God. Hence proceeded
proceeded that admonition of Christ: all things therefore, whatsoever they
shall say to you, observe ye, and do ye: but according to their works do ye
not. Calvin also refuteth this argument of our Adversaries more at length as
the foolish invention or dream of the Anabaptists: for he knew very well that
among his Ministers there were many most wicked ungodly men. Wherefore it is
very strange, that his followers will repeat and inculcate this argument so
often.

16. Our Adversaries have many other arguments besides these which need no
confutation: for they are not taken out or the word of God, but all do rely and
are grounded upon lies and mere fables forged by ancient Heretics, or
Schismatikes, or at the least by such as were no fauourits nor welwillers to
the Sander. l. 7. citat. Baron in omnibus 12. ^o^ 2. Tim. 4. v. 4.
Church of Rome, the which Doctor Sa^ders and Cardinal Baronius prosecute
particulerly throughput all ages. Wherefore that saying of the Apostle does very
well agree to our Adversaries. And from the truth certes they will auerse their
hearing, and to sables they willbe converted.

17. We will here allege one most certain example of those Slanders the
Calu l. 4. Inst. c. 7. sect. 18.
which our Adversaries cast against the Church of Rome. And that we may also
omit that Calvin in few words has no less then five manifest lies of one only
Bishop of Rome, John 22. as Bellarmine clearly proves; the same Calvin truly
has forged three most famous and markable lies against the whole Church of
Bellarm. l. 4. de Ro^. Po^t. cap. 14. cum agit de loan. Papa. Calu. lib. 4.
inst. c. 7. sect 27. S. Aug. Tom. 7. devnitate Eccles. c. 2. and 3.
Rome: for he says, that these are the three principle articles of that
Divinity which is taught by the Bishops and Cardinals of Rome. First, that
there is no God. The second, that all things which are written and taught
concerning Christ, are lies and sables. The third, that there is no lyse after
this.

18. But that one answer which S. Augustine gave the Donatists slaundering
wrongfully Catholics in times past, may suffice to confute all these
reproachful and injurious lies of our present Adversaries. Let us not hear,
says he, what this or that man says; but what our Lord says: let us not
h^ere, this say I, thus say thou, but thus says our Lord, and what the holy
Scriptures say unto us concerning the Church.

19. Moreover that which in general S. Aug. Tom. 7. de vnitate Eccles. c. 12.
the same holy Father in another place says against the lies of the Donatists,
may now very well be applied in this manner to the Roman Church. I know, says
he, what is written in the holy and Canonical Scriptures concerning the Church
of Rome and the faith thereof, I know not what you say of her Apostasy or
falling from her says. Truly as we do read in books, the which you also do
honor and reverence, of the Roman Church and faith thereof, so also read you
unto us out of books the which we also do honor and reverence, how she
forsook and lost her faith. Does it please you, that we should believe every
slanderous reproach of men upon what occasion soever it was uttered and
objected against the Roman Church: the which the holy Ghost has both delivered
and commended unto us by his holy Scriptures: this indeed is pleasing to you,
but whom also it should more justly please, you see well enough; but you being
overcome by obstinacy will not yield to the truth. And a little after. Lo here
the Roman Church, Romans 1. v. 7. Romans 1. v. 8.
with whom I communicate: where I read thee her name, there find thou me her
saultes if thou can, but if thou cryest, and rehearsest them from some other
place, we following the voice of our Pastor evidently declares unto us by the
mouth of the Apostle S. Paul, do not admit believe, or hear Joan. 10. v. 17.
your words. My sheep, says our heavenly Pastor, hear my voice and follow
me. His testimony of the Roman Church is not obscure, but very clear and
manifest Whosoever will not go astray or wander Rom 1. v. 7. and 8.
from his flock, let him hear him, let him follow him. Hitherto S. Augustine.

20. Finally it is here diligently to be noted, that our Adversaries never
durst be so bold as to affirm so strange and absurd things of the Church of
Rome, so ancient in it self, and so commended by all the ancient holy
Fathers, yea and by the Apostle S. Paul himself, but that they Romans 1. v. 7.
and 8.
falsely persuade themselves that she has lost and forsaken the true doctrine
of Christ. Hereupon they say that Rome is Babylon, and they are not ashamed to
affirm the Pope to be Antichrist. But if it were once proved manifestly, that
the Roman Church teaches nothing which is not very agreeable to the word of
God, all our Adversaries weapons against the Church of Rome will easily be
blunted and overthrown, and also they will be forced to confess with Calvin,
that the Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 1. sect. 10^ infine.
breach from this Church, is the denial of God and Christ, or that there
cannot be imagined any fault more heinous. But this God willing shall be more
evidently hereafter declared in every Controversy.

CHAP. IX. Of the Adoration of the Pope of Rome, and of the kissing of his
feet.
AMongst other Crimes wherewith the Roman Church is charged by our Adversaries,
one at which many take offense, is the adoration of the Pope, and the kissing
of his feet. We will therefore in this Chapter say some what in justification
thereof, for if it shall appear that nothing is done therein which is not
warranted by the written word, it will appear how little reason they have to
term that impio^^ Idolatry, which is nothing else indeed but Religious piety.

2. Howbeit we are first to forwarne the Reader, to the end he be not deceived
by the name of Adoration, that Adoration in the holy Scripture has two
significations: in 1. Paral. vlt. v. 28. Genesis 2. v. 7. G^n. 27. v. 28. Genesis 49.
v. ^.
the one it appertains to God alone, in the other it may without any sin at
all, yea with great merit be given to men. And of adoration in both senses, are
verified those words of the Scripture; they adored first God, and then the
King. Many other places of Scripture there are which approve this adoration of
men, of which only we now treat. For this adoration only is exhibited to the
Pope, and not that other which belongs only to God: and it is exhibited unto
him as the Vicar of Christ, whereas the other cannot be exhibited but to the
true God himself. Now there are four testimonies of holy Scripture which
evidently prove, that the adoration of the Pope, is not only lawful, but also
dutiful.

3. The first testimony is, that which the Phophet I say records in these
words: Isaiae 45. v. 14.
Thus says our Lord, the labor of Egypt and the mercha^d^ze of Ethiopia, and
the eminent men of the Sabeans shall come unto thee, and they shall be thine,
they shall follow thee, they shall go with their hands manacled, or bound in
chains, and they shall adore thee, and make supplication unto thee. It is
manistest that the Prophet in this place speaks not to Christ, but to the
Church: for all the verbes and pronownes in the Hebrew text are of the feminine
gender, and not of the masculine: besides, it appears evidently by all that
goes before these words, and all that follows, that this promise was made
to the Church of Christ. The Prophet therefore says, that the labor and
negotiatio^ (that is the riches gotten together by labor and negotiation) of
Egypt, and Ethiopia, and the eminent persons of the Sabeans) by whom are
understood the Princes of the Gentiles) shall pass over to the Church, and they
sh^lbe the Churches, and they shall walk after the Church in manacles (by
which are signified Ecclesiastical laws) and that they shall adore the
Church, and make supplication to her.

4. And it is to be observed, that the Hebrew word in the last co^iugation, as
it is used here, and in a manner every where else, signifies to prostrate ones
self before another, not howsoever, but by way of ador ation, as all that are
skillful in the Hebrew tongue know, in so much as the adoration done only to
God is often expressed by this word. This therefore is the true sense and
meaning of this place, they shall prostrate themselves before thee, thereby to
exibite adoration unto thee. We have therefore out of the Scripture that the
Church, and consequently Calu. eo^ment. in Isa. 45. v. 14. edit. ann. 1559.
Ge^. apuds Joan. ^rispinum.
the Ministerial head thereof, not only may, but must be adored, unless we
will make God to fa^sify his promise. But the crafty dealing of Calvin here is
to be detected, who to abuse the Reader leaves out in his latin translation
twice the Pronowne Te, that this adoration may not seem to be referred to the
Church, but either to God, or to Christ; for he translateth not, adorabunt-te,
and obsecrabunt: ie: but thus, Adorabunt atque obsecrabunt: whereas in the
Hebrew, the particle ( te) is twice put in the ^^^^inine gender, so as this
adoration and obsecration must needs be referred to the Church, and therefore
those of Genena durst not omit the same, neither in their French Bibles, not in
their corrupt translation: which they call Vatublus, no nor Culuin himself in
the former edition Calu. in epist. ad Reg. Angl. ante comment. in Isaiam edit.
illi^^ anni 1559.
of his Commentaries upon Isaias, which was set forth in French in the year
1552. but in his latter latin edition in the year 1559. (which he will needs
have accounted a new work) being now become more wary, he twice omitteth that
particle, and that not unadvisedly, but of se^ purpose, as is manifest by his
former edition.

5. The second testimony is also in the same Prophet ^sai^, in which much more
clearly is declared the exceeding great honor which the Kings and Princes of
the earth shall do unto the Church: for thus God speaks to the Church of
Isa. 49. v. 23.
Christ. Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers, and Queens shall be thy nursed* thy
shall adore thee with their faces bowed down to the earth, and li^ke up the
dust of thy feet: Where not only is expressed that humble adoration, by which
one prostrateth himself before another bowing down his face even to the
earth, but there is further added a new metaphor of embracing, and kissing of
seete, put in practice by Christian Emperors, Kings, and Princes, thereby to
honor the vicar of Christ, and in him the Church, or rather Christ himself:
for whosoever with greedines and fervor, hasten to the embracing and kissing
of the feet of any man, seem as it were to lick, and thereby to wipe away
the dust of his feet, for the Hebrew word signifies to wipe away in what
manner soever, as may be seen in the book of Numbers the 22. Chap. and the 4.
v. and the 3. of Kings Chap. 18. v. 38.

6. The Prophet Isay then in these words foretold that Kings and Queens, that
is Princes, men and women, should prostrat themselves down to the earth at the
feet of the Church, so as by embracing and kissing thereof they should seem to
wipe away the very dust of the Churches feet, which prophesy has by^
fullfilled of old, and as we see, is still fullfilled in the Roman Church by
the humble and Religious submission expressed by Christian Catholic Princes in
the embracing and kissing of the Bishop of Romes feet, the supreme head of the
Church on earth, which kind of Religious worship seeing it was so many ages
ago foretold by the Prophet, our Adversaries have small reason to think the
same so absurd a thing, or so much estranged from Christian piety.

7. The third testimony is taken from the same Prophet, which no less
manifestly does show unto us, that such an adoration and kissing of the
Churches feet was to be practiced as has been said; for amongst many other
things which he fore tells, appertayning to the Majesty and powerful
authority of the Kingdom of Christ Isa. 60. v. 14.
to come, he sets down this promise made by God to the Church. The sons
of them that humbled and afflicted th^^, shall come and bow unto thee, and all
they that detracted from thee shall adore thy footsteeps: which in the Hebrew
is much more clear, where it is thus: they shall adore the bendings of thy
feet, then the which nothing could be said more manifestly for the adoration
of the Churches feet in her visible head; for the be^dings of the feet by the
figure Synecdoche signify the feet themselves, as may be seen in the third of
I^su^ and the 13. v. For the bendings of the feet in that place are in the 15.
v. follownig called feet, so the bendings of the hands themselves, 1. Reg. 5.
v. 4. and 4. Reg. 9. c. v. 35. which words of the Prophet convince Calu^n, as
malbe said. We see then how the Prophet Isaias, not in one place only, but in
many, fortelleth this adoration as a thing very remarkable, and which greatly
sets forth the honor and excellency of the Church of Christ.

8. The fourth testimony is to be seen in the Apocalypse, where S. John
testifies in express terms, that God made such a promise to the Angel,
that is, to the Bishop of the Church of Philadelphia; Behold, I will make them
come and adore before thy seete, and they shall know that I have loved thee,
Apocal. ^. v. 9.
which is all one, as if he had said, I will make them come and adore thy
feere, for in the Scripture according to the Hebrew phrase, to adore before any
thing, 1. Reg. 1. v. 19.
is to adore the thing: so Elcana and Anna his wife are said to have adored
before our Lord, when they adored our Lord himself: so S. John in his
Apocalypse writes, that all Nations shall come and adore before God, Apoc. 15.
v. 4.
that is, they shall adore God himself: lastly that which by S. Luk^ is
expressed in these words, if thou shall adore before me, Luc. 4. v. 7. Matthew.
4. v. 9.
S. Matthew expresses thus, if falling down thou shall adore me. It is all
one therefore in the Scripture, to adore before a thing, and to adore the thing.
Moreover if God was willing and pleased that men should adore the (...) of the
Bishop of Philadelphia, much more grateful and acceptable will it be to him,
that Christians with a godly affection should prostrate themselves at his fee^e
who is the supreme Bishop of the whole Church, and by kissing of them exhibit
unto him not only a C^^ill, but also a Religious adoration, adoring him in God,
and for God, which is well Apoc. 3. v. 9.
expressed by God himself when he says, they shall know that I have loved
thee: so as this adoration must be admitted, or express Scriptures denied.

9. Neither is this any whit differing from the custom of the ancient Church,
as our Adversaries object, but rather very conformable and agreeable thereunto:
for it is manifest that kissing of feet was exhibited of old, not only to
Hier. pist. 61 ad Pamach. n. ^5. iux. edit. Mariani Victor. Chrysostom. Ho^. 14. in.
1. epist. ad Tim.
the Bishop of Rome, but also to other holy personages. For thus writes S.
Hierome of blessed Epiphanius; Men and women of all ages did flock unto him in
great troops, offering their little ones, kissing his feet etc. And S.
Chrysostom vehemently exhorts the people, to prostrate themselves at the
feet of all Monks in sign of honor and reverence. Come, says he, and touch
their holy feet* for it is much more h^^^^^rable to touch their f^^t, then to
touch the head of others.

10. And that it was an ancient custom in the Roman Church, that such as came
to salute the supreme Bishop should prostrate themselves and kiss his feet,
is sufficiently proved by the history of S. Susanna recited by Baronius: and
Tertullian Baron. To^. 2. an 294. n. vlt.
who lived a hundred years before Susanna, makes also not obscure mention
hereof: for describing the manner after which in his time penitents were wont
to be received in the Roman Church* amongst other things, he says: that
penitents were wont to fall down to the Tertul. de paenitent. c. 9.
Priests, and to kneel to the dearly beloved of God: which is nothing ^l^ but
kneeling down to adore. And the same Tertullian else where says, that they
were Tertul. de pudicit. c. 13.
wont to lick up the footesteps of every one that past: where he seems to
allude to those words of the Prophet Isay, cited Isa. 49. v. 23. Isa. 60. v. 4.
a little above, they shall lick up the dust of thy seete, and adore the
steps of thy feet. Now if it be so that they licked the footestepe^ of all
Christians, much more doubtless the footesteps of the supreme Bishop, who
received them into the Church, and who at that time was called the blessed
Pope, as the same Tertullian witnesses.

11. Neither does this adoration derogate any thing from the honor of God or
Christ, but rather much more illustrate and set it forth, for this honor is
exhibited to the Bishop of Rome, not for his own holiness or any other quality
with which he is adorned as a private person, but only for that authority and
spiritual power which he received from Christ, and which indeed properly
appertains to God, and to Christ and therefore in him, and by him, Christ,
whose person he represents is honored and adored, according to those words of
Tertullian. When Tertul. de p^nite^t. ce^o.
therefore, says he, thou stretchest thy self sorth to the knees of thy
brethren, thou layest hold on Christ and make thy supplication to Christ. And
this Calvin himself by the force of truth confesses, when he speaks of the
Adoration of the Church. For expounding those words of the Prophet Isay, they
shall adore the steps of thy feet, or as he translateth, they shall bow
themselves down to the plants of thy feet, thus he writes: Here some man
Calu in c. 60. Matthew. v. 14.
will ask whether this honor of which the Prophet speaks, be not too much,
and greater then is to be exhibited to the Church? for to how our selves down
and prostrate our selves are signs of that honor which no man ought to admit.
I answer, this honor is not exhibited to the members, but to the head, to wit
Christ, who is adored in the Church: so Calvin: which also those words of God
in the Apocalypse manifestly declare to be true: I will make them adore thee
before thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee, for therefore is
this honor exhibited to the supreme Bishop, because God has so exalted the
Roman Sea, and b^ene so liberal toward it, which is a sign of exceeding
great love. And here hence it is, that the same veneration is exhibited to all
Bishops of Rome, as well to the bad as to the good, for they are not honored
for their own goodness, but for the office which Christ bestows upon them. As
also they are called holy, and most holy, not for their Act. 28. v. 15.
own personal holiness, but for the holiness of Christ, whose person and place
they sustain upon earth, and for the holiness of the office which they receive
from God: even as S. Paul called Festus President of Jury, very good, not for
any goodness of his Baron. To^. 1. anno 58. number. 13.
own, for he was an Infidel and a wicked man, but in regard of his office, for
so the Presidents of Proninces were wont to be styled, as well notes Baronius.

12. Moreover whereas in the Scripture feet signify, divine mission, and
vocation, which is most ample in the Bishop of Rome, no marvel Romans 10. v. 15.
if greater veneration be exhibited to his feet: and it is to be observed that
there is a Cross upon his shoe, which all kiss, to give us to understand that
the honor is not exhibited to him but to Christ crucified, whom he represents.

13. To conclude, here hence is easily solued that which our object of S.
Peter's refusing to be adored by Corneleus Act. 10. v. 25. and 26.
the Centu^ion: for Cornelius adored not S. Peter in respect of Christ whose
Vicar he was, but in respect of himself whom he took to be some God, as did
the Licaonians Act. 10. v. 10. Hieron. aduers. Vigil. ep. 53. n. 12. iuxta
edit. Marian. victorij.
think of Paul and Barnabas: so S. Hierome: or surely, they thought Peter to
be more the^ a man, as manifestly appareth by S. Peter's answer, Arise, for I
also am a man, and therefore Cornelius was to be admonished and corrected: for
adoration is either good or bad, according to the cause or reason for which it
is exhibited. Now the cause for which Catholics exhibit the same to the
Bishop of Rome is very good; to wit, the excellent power of Christ, or rather
Christ himself governing and ruling his Church in his Vicar, Act. 16. v. 26.
and therefore this adoration is good and grateful to God, but the cause of
Cornelius adoration was fond and false, and therefore his adoration was naught
and worthily reprehended.

14. I know our Adversaries often object that Pope Alexander the third did
insolently trample under his feet Frederike the Emperor: but this foolish
fable is soundly and copiously refuted by Baronius, citing the testimonies of
such as were present and have committed to writing all that passed, in which
there was nothing unusual, but the Pope admited from Frederike the accustomed
adoration. He that desires more concerning the kissing of the Popes feet, may
read Joseph Steph^nus who has written a whole book thereof: it is sufficient
for us to have briefly proved the same by many evident testimonies of holy
Scripture.

CHAP. X. Of General Counsels.
GENERAL Counsels do represent the whole body of the Catholic Church;
wherefore we will now speak a little of them: for seeing that we have already
spoken of the head of the Church, it remains we treat of the body thereof. But
this we will do briefly. For our Adversaries now adays grant many things
concerning this matter which in times past they denied. To the end therefore
that the true state of this Controversy may the better be understood, three
things are to be considered which our Adversaries having now learned by
experience to be true, do willingly grant unto us.

2. The first is, that these Counsels are very profitable, and that the
authority thereof is not to be despised. For seeing that Hebr. vl^. verse. 17.
the Apostle warns us, to obey every true Pastor, much more are we bound to
obey many assembled together. For which cause our Adversaries would also that
we should all obey their synodicall assemblies: Hereupon says Calvin, Truly
Calu. l. 4. Inst. c. 9. sect. 13.
we do willingly grant, that if there happen debate about any doctrine* there
is no better, nor surer remedy, then if a Synod of true Bishops assemble
together, where the doctrine in controversy may be discussed. Thus he. And
even natural reason it self conuinceth this to be true, as Calvin also
confesses. For it is an easie^ matter for many assembled together to Calu.
eade^ sect. 13.
discern the truth from falsehood, then if any one should attempt it at home.

2. The second thing which our Adversaries grant, is, that General Counsels
Mat. 18. v. 20. Calu. c. 6. citato. sect. 2. 6. 9. seque^t. Beza 3. volum.
Tract. Theol. Tract. 6. de Eccles. notis. page 1. 8. (...). ann. 19^^. Calu. l.
4 Inst cap. 9. sect. ^
when they are assembled together in the name of Christ do not err in matters
of faith* for they consesse that Christ promised this to two or three assembled
together in his name. Thus Calvin, and he adds, that they may err when they
are not called together in the name of Christ, the which no Catholic did ever
deny, as will appear hereafter.

4. The third thing which they admit, is that the first General Counsels were
lawfully assembled, and that they did not err in points of faith. Thus Beza
expressly, who admits also the fifth and sixth general Council, and he says
that all those of his Religion are of this opinion. Calvin also of the ancient
Counsels writes thus: I reverence them from my heart, and with them to be had
in their due honor Calu. eod^ c. 9. sect. 8.
with all men. And a little after, when he treats of the ancient Cou^cells,
he says, that besides those four first general Counsels, to wit, Nic^num,
Co^stantinopolitanu^, the 1. Ephesine and Chalcedonerse, he admits also such
other ancient Counsels, the which cannot be understood Eodem c. 9. sect. 9.
but of the fifth and sixth. For a little after he plainly rejects the
seaue^th.

5. Here it is also to be noted, that Luther in the beginning rejected wholly
Luth. in l. contra Regem Angliae.
all general Counsels: but the Caluinists afterward by reason of Seruetus and
other Anti-trinitarians were forced to admit the first four Counsels.
Moreover by reason of the Vbiquitarian Lutherans, who confunded the properties
of the two Natures of Christ, they were co^streined to admit also the fifth and
sixth. And these things even the Caluinists themselves do grant unto us.

6. But Catholics teach these five things of the general Counsels. The first
is, that a general Council cannot without the word of God make any new
articles of faith, but her office is to explicate clearly and propose the word
of God to be believed of all, the which the Church has received from Christ
and his Apostles. For a lawful general Council defines nothing in matters
of faith, which either is not extant in the holy Scripture, or Council. Trident.
sess. 4.
may not be gathered by the traditions of the Apostles, or lastly may not
evidently be deduced out of both. The which the Council of Trent does
manifestly profess; for now we must not expect new revelations Calu. l. 4.
Inst. c 8. s^ct. 10. in fine.
from heaven. Wherefore it is a mere slander that Calvin says, that
Catholics teach, that the Church has authority to make new articles of faith.
and that Catholics despising the word of God do coin at their own pleasure
new points of faith.

7. The second is, that we acknowledge S. Aug. To^. 7. de Baptis. cont. Donat.
l. 2. c. 3.
that General Counsels may err in matters: which do not belong unto our
faith, and in this sense said S. Augustine, One full and perfect Council may
be corrected by another. Not in faith, the which is never changed, but in
Ecclesiastical Constitutions, the which according to the diversity of times,
both are and should often be changed. Whereupon in the same place he writes,
that things ordained before may be changed by those which come after, when we
see by experience that is opened and made known which before was hidden and
secret. For the experience of new matters which happen may change or correct
the Ecclesiastical laws and Constitutious, but it cannot alter and change
matters of faith.

8. Wherefore Calvin wrongfully obiecteth against us, that S. Leo the Call. l.
40. Just. c. 9. sect. 11
Pope reprehended the Council of Chalcedon, seeing that Calvin himself
acknowledges in the same place, that to appertain nothing to faith which S.
Leo reprehended. And he also confesses that Catholics teach, that Counsels
may err in those things which nothing concern faith. And no less foolishly
Calvin reprehendeth the first Council of Cal^. eod^ c. 9. sect. 17.
Nice, about matters which do not belong unto faith.

9. The third is, that we acknowledge those Counsels may err, which either
are not lawfully assembled, or do not proceed lawfully in their business they
have in hand. For such Counsels indeed are not assembled together in the name
of Christ: and of this sort was the Council of the Arians holden at Ariminum,
that of the Eutichians at Ephesus, the seventh Constantinopolitane Council of
the Image-breakers, the which therefore our Adversaries do in vain object
against us.

10. The fourth is, that albeit a Council be lawfully assembled, and seem to
proceed orderly, the definitions notwithstanding thereof will not be
altogether certain, according to the opinion of many Catholics, unless they
have their approbation from the Vide Bell. l. 2. de Eccles. milit. cap. 11.
Bishop of Rome, if he be not present at the Council. The reason is, because
before that the Council be approved and allowed of by the Pope, it is as yet
an imperfect body of Christ without any visible head, and such a body may
stumble and Council. Trid. sess. vlt. infine Conc. Nicaenum^. dequo Baron. To^.

Synod in ep. ad^dgatho^e^ Papam. Suprac. 17. huius Controu.
fall.

11. And hence it is, that the Council of Trent demanded her confirmation from
Pius 4. who solemnly afterward confirmed it. The which also the other ancient
Counsels demanded, yea even those which our Adversaries do admit, as for
example the first Nicene Council, that of Calcedon, the sixth Synod, to omit
other later Counsels.

12. The fifth is, that we affirm a General Council approved by the Pope,
cannot err in faith. The reason is, because it is altogether necessary, that
there be some supreme judgment in the Church of God whereunto all should submit
themselves and believe assuredly in all matters in Co^trouersy, as we have
proved before: but there can be no other supreme judgment but this.

13. Moreover we see, that even from the beginning of the Church till now all
heresies and controversies concerning matters of faith, have been still ended
and taken away by the general Councels. Wherefore they who deny this do open
and make way for all old Heresies. The which when our Adversaries had learned
by experience in the Anti-trinitarians, Anabaptists, Vbiquitarians, and such
other sects, they were forced to admit. 4. h^iu^ cap.
those six more ancient Councels, as we said before: but the authority of all
General Counsels is alike, and equal.

14. Finally our Adversaries themselves Calu. l. 4^ Inst. cap. 9. sect. 13.
acknowledge, that there is no better or surer remedy to root out and take
away al heresies: therefore either this is a certain remedy, or else there is
none at all, the which to affirm were to deny the providence of God, and his
love to his Church.

15. Moreover that which our Adversaries say, to wit, that the later Councels
are not lawful Assemblies, because they have not observed due manner and
form, is a false lie: first because it does not become every private man, to
be judge in this matter, but it belongs to the whole Church, who having
received for so many years all these as lawful Counsels, we must not call
them any more in question.

16. And seeing that our Adversaries do embrace and approve the six first
Councels, the lawful form to be observed in Counsels is to be fetched from
them; the which is exactly observed in the later Counsels, as Baronius shows
evidently in every one of the first six Counsels. But Calvin acknowledges no
Calu. c. 9. citato sect ^.
lawful manner of any Synodicall assembly, nor any such to be gathered
together in the name of Christ, but where all things are proved by Scripture
only, rejecting all Ecclesiastical traditions: but we have already proved that
the Traditions Go^t. 1. c. 18. and seq.
of the Church of God are as a principal and chiefest part of the word of God.

17. Yea even this was the only cause why S. Cyprian and so many other holy
Bishops erred in the African Counsels, when they determined that all those who
were christened by Heretics should be baptized again, for they confirmed this
their opinion very probably by many places of holy Scripture: but they rejected
the ancient tradition of the Lyrin. lib. co^tra Heraes. c. 9. and 10. S. Aug.
Tom. 7. de baptism. co^tra Donatist. l. 2. c. 7. in fine. and cap. 8. and 9. S.
Aug. Tom. 7. l. 3 de bapt. co^tra Donatist. c. 4. and l. 3. citato c. 2. 5. 6.
7. 8. and 9. loan. 14. ^. 9.
Church, the which they knew very well was opposite to this error, as though it
had been contrary to the holy Scriptures, as S. Vincentius Lyrinensis declares
very well, and before him S. Augustine in many places.

18. And that which is more, S. Augustine manifestly writes, that he had been
of S. Cyprians opinion, by reason of those probable reasons which were deduced
out of holy Scripture, but that the whole Catholic Church had defined the
contrary. And as the same holy Father teaches at large, they most of all
oppugned the custom of the Church, which were in the same error with S.
Cyprian, obiecting among other things that place of the holy Scripture, the
which our Adversaries now adays object against vs^ God says, I am the truth,
he does not say, I am the custom. Unto whom S. Augustine answers very well,
that the custom of the Church is not opposite to Truth, but it is even Truth
it self.

19. Our Adversaries arguments are of small account or moment. Calvin brings
in the example of Caiphas and of the Jewish Council wherein Christ was
condemned. The same argument Beza Bez. in 1. Tim. 2. v. 25.
also alleges, But who does not know that this was neither a general
Council. whereunto Christ was not called nor any ^ther true belieuer, nor
lawful in it self, seeing that it was not assembled in the name and authority
of Christ who was then the supreme head of the visible and militant Church, as
also because it was called together against the true Church of God, by the
wicked and cursed Synagogue of the Jews. For that was the true Church which
adhered unto Christ and believed in him: but that other which was altogether
deprived and had lost the true faith of Christ was rather a fit Church for
Satan and other infernal spirits. And I marvel truly that Calvin and Beza
do allege that Council as true and lawful which was assembled against Christ
himself, as also by those who were not true belieuers ^o. 15. v. 22. Psalm.
117. v. 21. Isa. 9. v. 9. and 10. Isa. 6. v. 14. Dan. ^. v. 26. Mat. vlt. ^.
vlt.
in Christ, yea who were filthily stained with the most heinous sin of
infidelity, as Christ humselfe witnesses: but we willingly leave such a Church
and Council to our Adversaries.

20. It was also manifestly foretold by the Prophet, that Christ should not be
received by the Jews, and that the Synagogue of the Jews should then fall
from Ioa. 14. v 16. Calu. c. 9. citato sect. 8. S. Aug. To^. 6. l. 3. contra

her faith. But the holy Scriptures teach the plain contrary of the true
Church of Christ, to wit, that Christ and his spirit shall remain with her for
ever.

21. But neither is that other argument which Calvin and Beza use any better,
to wit, that S. Augustine would not urge the authority of the Council of Nice
against Maximinus the Arian. For neither can we urge the authority of the new
testament against the Jews, not because we have any doubt thereof, but because
the Jews do not admit the new Testament. In the same manner when that Arian
would not admit the Council of Nice, but did plainly reject it, S. Augustine
should in vain have urged the authority thereof: for otherwise it is well
known that S. Augustine never had any doubt of the faith explicated in the
Council of Nice; the which even our Adversaries embrace as the most true word
of God.

22. Such as desire to see any more concerning this controversy of the General
Counsels, let them read Bellarmine in his first and second book of the Church
militant, and Coccius in his first Tome, the seventh book, the 21. and 22.
article.

CHAP. XI. Of the Authority of the ancient Holy Fathers.
NOw it remains we say somewhat of the ancient holy Fathers, and of their
writings, both because they were in times past the chiefest members of the
true Church of Christ, even by the confession of our Adversaries, as also
because in the particular controversies we shall often use the testimonies and
authorities of the holy Fathers.

2. We know indeed well enough that they were men, and that they might have
erred (but neither are they Gods nor Angels, who accuse them of their errors).
We know also that one or more of the said holy Fathers have sometimes erred,
when they left the more common opinion of others.

3. But we affirm this constantly, that the ancient holy Fathers received by
the Church of God, have never written any thing with a common and vnanime
consent, that is either contrary to the holy Scriptures, or to any point of
faith.

4. Moreover out of the writings of the holy Fathers in four diverse manners
some forcible and conuincing arguments may be taken.

5. First, out of the common consent of all, or at the least of the most part
without any contradiction at all. For if they had all erred in a necessary
point of salvation, the whole ancient Church should also have erred, the which
even our Adversaries Cap. 7. huius ^o^t.
acknowledge to be false, as we have declared before.

6. Secondly, that promise of Christ Matthew. v^t. v. penuit. and vit.
whereby he assured us, that he would be always present with his Church, was
properly made to the Pastors and Doctors of the same; for he promised that he
would be present with those whom he sent to baptize and preach, to wit, the
Pastors of the Church.

7. Thirdly, Pastors and Doctors Ad Ephesians. 4. v 11. 12. and 13. and 14.
were ordained by God in his Church, as the Apostle witnesses, to the end,
that we be not carried about with every wind of Doctrine, but that we may
continue in the unity of says, till we meet with Christ, in the last day. But
if all the Pastors and Doctors of the Church could err, we might easily be
carried away with many blastes of strange doctrines, neither could the unity of
faith always continue: and in this manner God should have provided very badly
for his Church, that it should never err.

8. Finally, if all the Pastors and Doctors of the Church should teach any
doctrine contrary to faith, there should no sincere and true preaching of the
word of God remain in the Church, seeing that only Pastors and Doctors are
lawfully called to the preaching of the true faith of God. But without the
sincere preaching of the Suprac. 8. huius controu.. 15
word of God it is impossible, that the Church of Christ should consist, as
even our Adversaries confess, and as we have declared before.

9. Secondly, we take arguments out of the ancient holy Fathers, as out of
most faithful and true witnesses of that faith which in their times was
preached in the Catholic Church. For our Adversaries acknowledge, that in
their time the true and sincere faith of Christ was preached. We therefore
allege them as witnesses of that faith: for if we do not believe them who
lieued at that time, whom will we believe? but they were both eye witnesses,
and nothing suspected of falsehood, as S. Augustine declares very well
disputing against the Pelagians.

10. Thirdly, we take arguments out S. Aug. Tom. 7. cont. Iulianu^ Pelag. l. 2.
cap. vlt.
of the holy Fathers, as out of those Doctors whose writings have been received
and approved by the ancient Church of God. For it was wont to impugn and
condemn those writers who wrote any thing contrary to the true faith, least
their writings might be hurtful to the future Church: and on the other side it
approved their writings who taught the true faith. There is yet extant a Decree
of the Vide T^. 2. Council. inter Decreta S. Gelasij. Papae.
Roman Council, set forth almost a thousand two hundred years ago concerning
these writings. They therefore who have been approved by the ancient Church
are most worthily to be believed, because the primitive Church, as our
Adversaries confess, has never erred in judgment concerning matters of faith.

11. Eourthly, we take arguments out of the holy Fathers, as out of the most
holy and learned men and Blessed Saints of God. For either they had the sincere
true faith, and if it be so, we should embrace the same; or they had it not,
and if it be so, they were not Saints of God, nor could they be acceptable unto
him, as the Apostle testifyeth.

12. By this very argument the Catholics Socrat. l. 5. c. 10. So^o^. l 8. c.
12. historiae Eccles.
in times past overcame the Arians, for they urged them to receive the holy
Fathers who wrote before Arius his time, or they should excommunicate them, as
Socrates and Sozomenus do testify.

13. And to this purpose serve very fitly those words of S. Augustine, wherein
S. Aug. Tom 7. contra Iuli ^^^ Pe^agianu^ l. 2. c. vlt.
he declares what was the judgment of the primitive Church concerning this
matter. For thus speaks S. Augustine to the heretics of his time, whiles he
urges them with the testimony and authority of the ancient Fathers who were
before him. They had (says he) no regard either to our friendship or to yours,
neither were they enemies to either of us, they are neither angry with you nor
with us: they were not moved with pity and compassion on either side; what
they found in the Church that they h^ld, what they had learned, that they
taught, they delivered to their Children that which they had received from
their own Fathers. We pleaded in our cause against you before these judges,
and yet by them our cause was ended long since: neither we nor you were so much
known to them, and yet we bring sorth their sentences given in our favor
against you. We had not as yet begun any combat with you, and yet so long
ago they proclaimed our victory. So far S. Augustine.

14. Finally Vincentius Lyrinensis a French man, who lived at the same time
with S. Augustine proves the same very well, by many reasons and examples,
throughout all that most learned book the which he wrote against the profane
Novelties of all heresies. And we will conclude and end this Chapter of the
authority of Vide pr^sertim c. 4 and 40. eiusde^ libelli.
holy Fathers, and this our whole disputation of the Church of God, with the
same words wherewith he ended that his golden book. For thus he writes in the
end of it: If neither the Apostolical definitions nor ecclesiastical decrees
be to be violated, whereby according to the most holy and uniform consent of
all antiquity, all heretics, and lastly Pelagius, Celestius, and Nestorius
(for these were the last Heretics that lived in Vincentius his time) have bin
always most justly condemned; it is necessary in truth, that all those
Catholics who will hereafter prove, and show themselves to be the true and
lawful children of our holy mother the Catholic Church, should adhere and
unite themselves stedfastely, as also die in the profession of that sacred says
of those holy Fathers: and lastly that they should abhor, detest, banish, and
persecute all the profane novelties of all most wicked Heretics. Hither to S.
Vincentius.

The end of the second Controversy.
