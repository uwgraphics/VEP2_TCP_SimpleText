A TREATISE OF THE WRITTEN WORD OF GOD.

COMPOSED In Latin, by the Reverend Father James Gordon Huntley of Scotland,
Doctor of Divinity, of the Society of JESUS.

And translated into English, by I. L. of the same Society.

The first Part of the first Controversy.

Permissu Superiorum, M. DC. X IV.

THE FIRST CHAPTER.
Of the Scope and Method of this Treatise.
ALL the Controversies of this time may be reduced to two heads, for either
they are certain general principles and foundations of our faith and
religion, or they are particular questions appertayning to the same. Amongst
other general principles there are two, about which there is greatest
contention at this day: the one is the Word of God, the other the Church: we
will first speak of the word of God, and afterward of the Church, and lastly
we will examine every particular Controversy, if God shall ^raunt us life and
health. Two things there are which now adays hold many in error. The one is a
(...) opinion that many have, who think it a matter of little importance,
whether they give credit or no to many things taught by the Roman Church, which
dangerous persuasion may be taken out of the mind^s of all faithful people,
by that which we shall deliver concerning the Word of God, and the Church, for
thereby it shall evidently appear, that al things are firmly to be believed,
which the Roman Church belieueth, and that without this faith no man can hope
to be saved. The other is, that such as desire to find out the true faith in
every particular Co^trouersy, are oftentimes so hindered by the sleights and
falsehoods of our adversaries, as it willbe very hard for them to discern that
which is true from that which is false. Wherefore we will endeavor in every
particular Controversy, to set down the true state of the question. Afterward
we will lay open the foundation of the Catholic doctrine. And lastly we will
plainly and briefly answer the chief objections of our Adversaries whether
they be drawn out of the Scriptures, or taken from the Fathers.

2. And because our Adversaries evermore boast and brag of the written Word of
God, pretending out of it only to prove their doctrine and impugn ours: our
chief care shall be to show, that the Catholic and Roman faith is both
evidently and strongly to be confirmed out of the written Word of God, and the
doctrine of our Adversaries has no foundation at all in the holy Scriptures,
but is manifestly opposite and repugnant thereunto, yet so, as we will set down
the uniform consent of the ancient Church to be agreeing with us in every
Controversy, leaving the more ample search of antiquity, unto others, to whom
we will refer the Reader, setting down their particular names; so loath we
are that this book of ours should grow too great: and for the same reason we
have thought good to omit many arguments which might be drawn out of the holy
Scriptures for confirmation of the Catholic faith, contenting our selves to
set down only the more solid and evident proofs, because we are resolved to
be as brief as we may.

CHAP. II.
Of the Word of God in general.
THE word of God, if we speak of it in general, may be considered two ways,
either for that One, Eternal and Infinite Word which contains perfectly in
it self whatsoever is in the mind of Almighty God, which is the same with the
Son of God, and Word of the Father, of whom S. John speaks in his Gospel
saying: In the beginning was the Word, but of this Word we are to say nothing
here* but the Word of God may be other wise considered and taken for that Word
which was not always, nor contains all things which are in the mind of God
but a small part only of them, to wit, such things as God would have us know
and believe: and of the Word of God in this sense we speak now. For this Word
is the proper and complete object of our faith.

2. Moreover this Word has two conditions or properties, the one is, that the
same be revealed unto us, for there are innumerable verities in the mind of God
the which because they are not revealed to us, do not appertain to this Word.
The other is, that it be immediately revealed by God, for such things as God
manifests unto us by natural reason appertain not to this word of God, Romans
^. v. 19. and 20.
called therefore by the Deuines the revealed Word of God. Hebr. 11. verse. 1.


3. Of this Word of God so understood there is no Controversy between us and
our Adversaries, but only in words: for whereas our Adversaries say that
Catholics affirm, that we must with divine faith believe the words of men, or
which is worse, rather believe the words of men then the Word of God, it is a
mere slander, for there is no Catholic so ignorant but he knows that the
Theological virtue Faith relieth astogeather upon the pure, sincere, and
certain Word of God alone, according to that of S. Paul, 1. Thessal. ^. verse.
13.
when you had received of us the word of the heating of God you received it not
as the word of men, but as the Word of God, as indeed it is. Neither can any
man doubt but that the revealed word of God is partly the written Word
contained in the Canonical books of the old and new Testament, partly
unwritten and delivered by tradition and preaching, of which unwritten word the
Scripture makes mention in many places, These. c. 2. ^. 14 and 1. ad Cor. 15.
v. ^. ad Gal. 1. v. 8. 1. Petr. 1. v. vltimo.
but we will first treat of the written Word.

CHAP. III.
Of the written Word of God.
THE written Word of God consists of two parts, of the Letter which every*
man may read in the books themselves, and in the true sense of the Letter,
which is as it were the very soul and life thereof, without which the Letter
alone rather kills the^ quickneth or gives life: as we see evidently by
experience in the Jews, Arians, etc all other heretics, as well new as old:
for the Jews hold themselves stiffely to the Letter of the old Testament, and
the Arians, as also in a manner all other heretics, receive either
altogether, or for the greatest part the Letter of the new; but because they
will not acknowledge the true sense of the Letter, Jews they are Heretics
they are, Catholics they are not. And surely the Letter alone without the true
sense cannot truly and properly be called the Word of God, no more then a body
without a soul can truly and properly be called a man: wherefore they which
spoil the Letter of the true sense may be compared to them who bereave a man
of his soul and life.

2. But whosoever do substitute another contrary sense and meaning in place of
the true, do no otherwise, then they, who not only kill a man, but by Art
Magic bring into the body of the man killed, some other diabolical spirit, by
which the dead body is so moved, and stirred, as it seems to many to bealiue:
all this is so manifest a truth, as our Adversaries themselves are not able to
deny it.

3. This to have been the doctrine of the ancient Church sufficiently appears
by the words of S. Augustine. August. sermon. 78. de temp.
The unhappy Jews, says he, and more unhappy Heretics, whilst they attend
only to the sound of the ^etter, as a body without a soul, so they remay^^
dead, and void of the spirit which quickneth. And else where: August'^ Epist.
222^
All Heretics which receive the Scriptures and their authority will seem to
follow them* whereas indeed they follow rather their own errors, and are
therefore Heretics, not because they co^ntem^e them, but because they do not
understand them. And before him S. Hilary that honor of the French Nation.
Remember (says he) that there is not one of the heretics which does not say
that he preaches now according to the Scriptures, (...) l. ad Constable. (...).
even those things in which he blasphemeth, albeit he lies in so saying* And a
little after: All of them speak Scriptures, without the true se^ce and
meaning, they pretend says without faith indeed, for the Scriptures consist
not so much in the reading as in the understanding, neither are they understood
of such as go into preuarication, but continue and abide in charity. Moreover S
Hierome. Hiero^. in (...) Gal.
Let us not think (says he) the Gospel to be in the words of the Scripture
but in the sense, not in the out side, but in the inside, or marrow, not in the
leaves of the words, but in the sap, Matthew. 4. v. 6.
pith, or root of reason. And a little after: otherwise even the Devil
himself speaks. Scriptures, and all heresies according to Ezechiel make unto
themselves pillowes which they may lay under the elbow of every age. Ezech. 13.
v. ^8.


2. By that which has been said answer may be made to our Adversaries when
they object against us, that we affirm the Scripture to be imperfect, obseure,
like a nose of wax which a man may writh which way he will, and lastly the
origin and spring in a manner of all heresies: for we affirm this of the naked
and dead letter alone, destitute of the true sense; or rather of the letter, to
which the Heretics add their own perverse sense and meaning: neither have
our Adversaries any cause to wonder at this, seeing S. Paul himself says of
the bare letter alone, 1 Cor. 3. v. 6. 7. and 9.
that is kills, and brings eternall^ death and damnation. But never any
Catholic did ever attribute any such thing to the living letter, which has
conjoined with it the true and native sense, and which alone is truly and
properly the word of God.

CHAP. IIII.
How we are to seek out the true sense and meaning of the holy Scripture.
THERE is a great contention between us and our Adversaries, about the means
how to find out the true and natural interpretation of the lett^er, (...)
a thing to necessary to eternal salvation. They teach, diverse things
concerning this matter, but deliver nothing that is certain. One assigns
more rules to this purpose, another fewer, but when they have said all, they
confess at last that there was never any which has not at sometime erred in
seeking out the true interpretation of holy Scripture. For they give not their
assent either to the ancient Fathers, or to their own Masters in all things
they teach or write: nay they cannot assign any one whom they acknowledge not
to have erred sometime, Romans 3. v. 4.
nor dare affirm to be free from error, seeing as they say, every man is a
liar: and so at last all things are left by them doubtful and uncertain.

2. But the Catholics proceed after another manner, who teach, that the
certain and undoubted sense of the Letter is not to be taken from the judgment
of any particular man, but from the uniform consent of the ancient Fathers,
and especially from the judgment and interpretation of the Catholic Church, to
whom it appertains to judge of the sense and meaning of the holy Scriptures,
as the holy and O^cumenicall Council of Tre^t teaches very well: Council.
Trent. s^ss. 4.
for there is no doubt but that it is nore safe to follow such an interpreter
as cannot err, then such a oners erreth sometimes, or at leastwise may err,
but the Church cannot err in her judgment, Matt. 28^ c. vlc.
seeing that Christ and the holy Ghost remain with her to teach her all truth;
Joan. 14. ^. (...).
whereof more herafter when we shall come to treat of the Church.

3. It shall suffice to observe and note here, Joan. ^6. v. 13.
that according to the doctrine of our Adversaries nothing either solid or
certain is contained in the holy Scripture: for whereas all depends of the
true sense of the Letter, and with them there is no certain or sure means by
which to find out this sense, it follows that they call all into doubt,
which is in the Scripture, whereby who sees not how much they iniure them? But
contrariwyse according to the Catholic doctrine, all things are evident and
certain which are contained in the holy Scriptures, appertayning either to
faith, or good manners: the Catholics having ever a certain and faithful
Interpreter, to wit, the Catholic Church. And surely whosoever rejects the
sense which the Church gives, and in place thereof substituteth another
altogether repugnant to it, does all one with him, who rejecting the holy
Scripture should in place thereof bring in a new Scripture of his own forging,
the sense of the Scripture being no less a part of the word of God then the
letter, which in these few words Tertullian confirms out of the tradition of
the ancient Church: The sense adultered, Tertul. de praesc. c. 17
or falsified, is no less repugnant to the truth, then the letter, or style
corrupted.

4. And to conclude, it may be inferred, that salvation is to be found in the
Roman Church only, Mare. vlt. Verse. 16.
and none at all out of it, Joan. 3. v. 18.
which I prove thus. Both the Scripture testifyeth and all me^ confess that
divine faith is necessary to salvation, Heb. 11. v. ^
but such as forsake the Roman Church, cannot have divine ^aith which wholly
relieth upon the word of God only, but merely humane, seeing their faith is
founded not in the word of God, interpreted by the Church which cannot err,
but in the word and interpretation of Luther, and Calvin* or some other private
man, who as they themselves grant may err, and be deceived; such an humane
faith then, so doubtful and uncertain, and only warranted by man's authority,
cannot justify, or bring a man to eternal salvation.

CHAP. V.
How we may know which is the true letter of the holy Scripture.
ALL such as forsake the Roman Church, and make little account of her authority
are not only doubtful and vndertayne, which is the true sense of the
Scripture, but they can have no assurance at all either of the whole, or of any
part of the letter thereof. For whilst they go about to call in question, and
make doubtful certain books only of the old Testament, before they are aware
they take away all authority from all other books both of the old and new
Testament. For whereas there is but one certain and undoubted Canon of these
books, to wit, that which is received and appre^ued by the judgment of the
Catholic Church, which cannot err; our Adversaries rejecting this Canon, make
all the books doubtful contained therein* for no certain testimony can be had
of these books, but either by this Canon only, or by the ancient tradition of
the Church, but they neither admit this Canon, nor will stand to this unwritten
Tradition, or acknowledge it for the true Word of God.

2. Now as for the Canons lately set out by themselves, no man can safely
believe them, seeing they neither agree one with another, nor with the ancient
Canons of the Church, nor are any where found in the written Word of God, which
(as they teach) is only to be believed: neither can they bring any thing,
either concerning the Canon of the Hebrews, or any other ancient Canon which
they have not taken from the writings of the ancient Fathers, whose authority
without the express written Word of God, they will have to be in no wise
sufficient to engender faith: so as even by the judgment of our Adversaries,
none of all these can establish faith concerning this matter.

3. John Calvin indeed says, Lib. 1. Inst. c. 7. sect 2. in fine.
that it is as easy for a faithful man to discern Canonical Scripture from
that which is not Canonical, as to one that sees it is easy to discern light
from darkness, and white from Black. See Bell. l. 1. de verb. Det c. 17. 18.
(...).
But in so saying he contradicts both reason and experience, for it is
evident that in old time there was no small controversy amongst the raythfull,
yea and amongst learned and godly men concerning many books of the old and new
Testament, yea and also even now amongst such as our Adversaries esteem
faithful men, Calu. pra^at. in Epist. lacobi and a^te Epist. ad Heb. and ante
2. S. Pe^ri.
which Calvin himself in many places confesses*

4. Moreover Caluins own followers well perceauing this, fly unto their own
peculiar spirit, by which they say they are chiefly persuaded and moved, and
not by the only consent of the Church. But these speak nothing to the purpose,
for in faith two things concur, Rupell. co^fess. art. 4.
one is the cause or origin of faith, to wit God himself, and the holy Ghost,
whereof there is no controversy between us and them, for we all acknowledge
the holy Ghost to be the principal cause of the assent we give by faith, that
is to say, that it is the holy Ghost who chiefly persuades us to believe. The
other is the object of faith, or that which is to be believed, whereof we now
dispute, for the holy Ghost does not induce us to believe the false and
uncertain devises of men, but the pure and sincere Word of God only: we ask
therefore of our Adversaries, by what express Word of God he reuealeth unto
them, that there are so many Canonical books, and neither fewer nor more; for
we read not this any where in the Scripture, and they admit only the written
Word of God, how can the holy Ghost then persuade the^ ^o believe that which is
not the Word of God? Calu. l. 1. Instit. c. 9. sect. 1.
for we are not now to expect new ^^uelations from God, as do the ^nabaptists
and Libertines, whom for this cause our Adversaries condemn. It is necessary
therefore that if they will have us believe, that they are persuaded by the
holy Ghost to believe such books only to be authentical as they do say are
such; that they first show this to be a truth expressly contained in holy
Scripture, which they will never be able to do: wherefore there is no certainty
with them either of the sense of the holy Scripture, Innocent. 1. ep. 3. c.
vlt. Council. 3.
or of the Letter, nor ever will be until they return unto the Church again.
Carthag. can. 47. S. Aug. Epist. 235. Council.
But we Catholics are certain of both, for we have a most faithful Canon
received in the Church more the^ a thousand and two hundred years ago,
confirmed by a general, Tridents. sess. 4.
and Oecumenicall Council.

5. And this to have been the faith and doctrine of the ancient Church for
the discerning of true and authentical Scriptures, Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14.
sect. vlt.
that short but pithy sentence of S. Augustins (whom Calvin acknowledges to
have been the best and most faithful witness of antiquity) sufficiently
testifyeth, saying: Aug. Co^^. Epist. Manich^i c. 5.
I for my part would not believe the Gospel, unless I were moved by the
authority of the Church, of which place I will say more herafter in the
Controversy of the Church. And elsewhere he says: We receive the old and new
Testament in that number of books which the authority of the holy Catholic
Church delivers. Aug. sermon. 191. and temp.
So S. Augustine.

6. I know our Adversaries object many things against many books contained in
our Ecclesiastical Canon, but their chief arguments do not only derogate
authority from those books, but also from many others, which they receive as
Canonical. For they object that some Fathers did sometimes doubt of those
books which they will not admit, but they are not ignorant that some Fathers
of old have doubted of the Epistles of S. James, and S. Jude of the second
Epistle of S. Peter, of the 2. and 3. of S. John, of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, and of the Apocalypse, of which books they dare not now doubt, Rup^ll
^ Confes^ ^ art. 3^
especially Caluins followers, as is manifest by their confession of faith.

7. They say further, that in those books which they reject, there are many
things obscure, difficult, and full of contradiction, but what book of
Scripture in a manner is there in the which there do not occur sometimes
things obscure and hard to be understood? 2. Petr. 3. v. 26.
did not S. Peter acknowledge as much? But as for true contradictions there are
none at al howsoever there may be some things which at the first fight may
seem to imply contradiction, yet indeed all things agree very well together:
such a contradiction is oftentimes found in those books, which even our
Adversaries receive, yea even in the Ghospells themselves, Aug. de Doct.
which for all that are not to be rejected, Christian. l. 2. c. 41. and deserm.
Domini in monte l. 1. c. 3.
but humbly, soberly, and piously to be ^nterpreted, as S. Augustine many times
admonishes.

8. To conclude, all the arguments that our Adversaries make against these
books are fully answered by Catholic writers, which have set out Commentaries
upon those books, to wit, Cornelius Iansenius upon Ecclesiasticus, Bell. and
Grets. Controu. 1. l. 1. c. 7. and sequ^nt Iesmoreus in sua Chro^ol.
Ionnnes Laurinus upon the book of Wisdom, Ioannes Maldonatus and
Christopher a Castro upon Baruch, and Nicolas Serarius upon the rest of the
books of the old Testament which our Adversaries call Apocriphall, to omit the
most Reverend and famous Cardinal Bellarmine, and his Champion Iacobus
Gretserus* as also James Gordon Lesmoreus. For it is sufficient only to have
cited them, seeing that I write only an abridgment of Controversies, and not
any long commentaries upon the Scripture. And therefore content my self to have
showed in this place that our Adversaries must either receive the Canon of
Scriptures approved by the Council of Trent, or be utterly destitute of any
certain and assured Canon.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Hebrew Text.
OUR Adversaries when they are urged with Catholic arguments taken from the
Scriptures, are wont to fly to the Hebrew text of the old Testament, and to the
Greek text of the new, persuading themselves by this means to attain to the
true and proper sense of the letter: wherefore something is to be said in this
place of the Hebrew and Greek text, both which appertain to the Letter of the
holy Scripture.

2. We grant indeed, that when the Latin translation is either ambiguous o^
less plain, the Hebrew text is well and profitably looked into, as also that
diverse myst^ries which lie hidden in the Hebrew text and cannot sufficiently be
explicated in Latin words, may be the better understood. And lastly that we
may the more fully attain unto the force and Emphasis of that holy tongue.

3. But as for the Hebrew text now extant, we do not acknowledge it to be of so
great either authority, or perspicuity as our Adversaries pretend, and we
further deny that the vulgar Editio^ wherinsoeuer it differs from it, is to
be corrected by it, and that for two reasons. The first is, for that the Hebrew
text though never so incorrupt, further then it is approved by the authority of
the Church, is much more doubtful, and uncertain then the Latin. The other
reason is, for that the Hebrew text which is now in use is in many places
corrupted and depraved, in which the vulgar Edition is entire and uncorrupted.
Both these reasons shall be confirmed in the ensuing ^hapters, which the learned
Reader may see in the Latin edition, from the seventh Chapter to the 14. all
which I have omitted to put into English, because I intend to help the less
learned, who are not so capable of that so profou^d and learned a discourse.

CHAP. VII.
Of our Adversaries new Translations of the Bible.
THE Catholic Church of Christ not without good cause does reject and condemn
our Adversaries new Translations of the Bible, and that for many reasons. The
first and most just reason is, because such their translations are replenished
with errors, which have been invented either by Jews, or Heretics, of which
see many examples in the precedent Chapters of the Latin edition; but we in
this Chapter will set down three other causes or origens from whence these
errors spring, whereby it shall further appear, that our Adversaries can set
out no trans^ation which shall not be found full of many and great errors.

2. The first cause is, for that our Ad^ersaries either contemn, or make
little account of the translations and interpretations of the Fathers, and
employ all their labor in finding out all the versions, and interpretations,
and expositions of the Jews, which they highly extol and commend: so as in
their Commentaries upon the old Testament, you shall see them cite Thargus
Rabins, and such other Thalmudicall fictions, but especially Rabbi David Kim^i,
whom sometimes they call learned, sometimes the most learned among the
Hebrews. But of the ancient Fathers no mention at all, for if there be, it is
for the most part, either to tax, or manifestly to oppugn, or even to corrupt
their writings.

3. Now what can be more unreasonable or absurd, then to beg the true sense
of the Scripture of the Jews, 2. Cor. 3. v. 1^. and 1. Thessal. c. 2. v. 15.
1^.
who lack faith, and who have a veyle over their hearts, when they read the
old Testament, with whom God is not pleased, and who are Adversaries to all
men, upon whom the Angel of God is come to the end, who pervert all the oracles
of the Prophets that appertain to Christ; and lastly, who are the most
malicious enemies of Christians. And on the other side to despise the excellent
Doctors of Christ's Church, who even in the judgment of our Adversaries were
endued with the true faith, Romans 8. v. 9. Ephesians. 4. v. 14.
full of the holy Ghost, raised by God, and placed in the Church, to the end we
should not be carried about with every wind of doctrine, who have defended the
faith against all heresies, who have sincerely instructed the faithful people
in the mysteries of the Christian faith, who have faithfully sent down to
posterity the sense and interpretation of the Scriptures which they received
from the Apostles.

4. Moreover, whereas no man can rightly interpret the Scriptures who has not
received from God the gift of the interpretation, 2. Cor. 121 v. 10. 28. 2.
Petri 1. v. 20. 21.
which is not given but to the members of Christ, and his Church only, it is
apparent enough how much more safe it is to follow such holy Doctors, then the
impiou^ Jews which are wrapped in the snares of the Devil, 2. Timoth. 2. v. vlt.
and held captive at his will. And seeing that saying of Christ is most true,
Matthew. 15. v. 14.
if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch; it cannot be but
our Adversaries, blind and destitute of the light of faith, and led by the
blind Jews, must needs fall down headlong, and break their necks.

5. Here^hence it is, that our Adversaries do insert into the new translations
almost all the places of Scripture corrupted by the Jews, and that they deny
together with the Jews many oracles of the Prophets, to be understood of
Christ, and many ways wrest even those oracles which they cannot deny to be
understood of Christ, from that true sense in which they are cited in the new
Testament, by the Apostles, Evangelists, and Christ himself, to profane and
impious senses lately invented by the Jews out of their hatred to Christ.

6. The second cause is, that they desire nothing more then in their
translations to depart from the vulgar edition, the which seeing it is most
sincere and correct, they which almost in all things leave it, must needs
fall into many errors.

7. The third cause is, the malicious intention of our Adversaries, who set
forth new translations of the Scripture for no other end, then by them to
oppugn the Catholic doctrine, and to establish and confirm their own errors
and heresies: and therefore when any plain text occurreth, which makes
manifestly against their erroneous doctrine, they seek to make obscure the
true and proper sense by their perverse translation; but if they light upon any
place somewhat obscure, which may seem to favor their doctrine, they so
deprave it by their new translation, that the Scripture it self may seem to
confirm what they falsely teach, and so by this means they must needs stuff
their translations with infinite corruptions, for these three reasons: Grets.
tractat. denouis translation. in defen. Bellarm.
therefore not without great reason do we reject our Adversaries transla^ions
which so swarm with corruptions. Many other reasons are both learnedly and
largely set down by James Gretser, which we for breuity sake omit.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Latin vulgar Edition.
OUR Adversaries convinced by the truth it self, confess sometimes, that the
vulgar Edition not only is to be preferred before all other latin Editions, but
even before the Greek text of the new Testament, and the Hebrew text of the
old, for in many places rejecting them, they follow our vulgar translation, as
may be seen in the Latin edition in the Chapters 8. 9. 10. 13. notwithstanding
that in many other places they exceedingly inueigh against it, and with great
hostility oppugn it, partly for that they see the same to contradict in many
places their errors, and partly also, for that they labor by all means to
perruert the text of the Scripture by their new versions, to make the^ speak
in favor of their errors, which they cannot do if the authority of the old
interpreter continue in all things entire and undiminished. Calvin in Antidoto
contra 4^ sess Council. Tridentini
As for Calvin, he is so deadly an enemy to the vulgar edition, that with great
excess he declameth against it in this manner: So far off is it, says he,
that there is one entire leaf, as there are scarce three verses together not
defiled with some notable error. But to prove this his impudent assertion, he
brings only one place out of the new Testament, which a little after we will
show to have been exceedingly well translated out of the Greek. He brings no
other places out of the old Testament then such as he takes out of the
Psalms, which (as it is evident) are translated word for word out of the
Greek version of the Septuagint interpreters. Nay in the same place, Calvin
acknowledges that the Latin interpreter has, with all possible diligence,
expressed the Greek translation. And as for the Greek interpretation of the
Septuaginta, it is most learnedly defended by Genebrard, Geneb. i^ Psalm ^
so as it were superfluous to say any more. Indeed Caluins and Luthers
disciples find fault with many other places in the vulgar edition, both of the
old and new Testament, but we will lay four general grounds, out of which all
their arguments may be easily answered.

2. The first is: If our Adversaries will needs have the present Roman Church
condemned for following and authorizing the vulgar Latin interpretation, they
must needs also condemn the whole ancient Church, and all the Fathers who
lived in the first four hundred years after Christ, for they acknowledged no
other interpretation of the old Testament as authentical, then that of the
Septuaginta Interpreters, which much more departs from the Hebrew text, now
extant, then our vulgar Latin, as our Adversaries themselves confess. Wherefore
if the Roman Church be to be condemned for the vulgar Edition, much more the
Primitive Church for the version of the Septuaginta: and hereof it follows
further, that the Church is not to be condemned which follows a translation
of the Scripture which in some things may be amended, so long as nothing is to
be found in it which is repugnant either to faith or good manners: For
otherwise the ancient Church had erred in retayning the version of the
Septuaginta, which was corrupted in some places, but those corruptions were not
in any thing necessary to be known. Calu. l. 4, Instit c. 1. sect* 12.
Moreover Calvin himself con^esteth, that we must not depart from the Church,
for errors of little importance, the ignorance whereof neither does violate
Religion, nor prejudice our salvation. Wherefore albeit there should be some
such errors in the vulgar Edition, yet were not the Roman Church, Romans ^. v. 8.
Hiero^^. Epist. 57. ^d Dam.
which is so ancient and so hightly commended by the mouth of the Apostle (as
speaks S. Hierome) to be condemned or forsaken. And this may serve for
answer to our Adversaries arguments, when they object certain light faults of
the vulgar Edition which have crept into it, either by the negligence of the
printers, or by any other accident. As also what our Adversaries object against
the Psalter may heerby be convinced to be very weak, for seeing that no other
version is followed in it, then that ancient version of the Septuaginta, they
cannot condemn us, unless they will condemn the whole primitive Church,
together with us, yea the Apostles and Evangelists themselves, who followed
the same version, is as showed in the 11. Chapter of the Latin Edition of this
Controversy.

3. The second ground. A good interpreter does not ty himself to transtate
word for word, seeing that every tongue has his proper phrases, and manner of
speech, but contenteth himself to express the true sense and meaning of that
which he translateth. Wherefore all our Adversaries arguments are nothing worth
by which they prove that certain places of the vulgar edition are somewhat
otherwise in the Hebrew and Greek, so that the sense of the whole period be
one and the same, as most of the places are which they carpe at in the vulgar
Edition.

4. The third ground. The places of holy Scripture are of two sorts, some are
clear and manifest, as almost all are, which set down the history of the old
and new Testament. Others are obscure, and full of difficulty, as are many
places in the Psalms and Prophets. Now if the interpreter in such places as
are evident and manifest, do interpret rightly all of them, and in such places
of Scripture as are obscure, express a sense and meaning agreab^e to the
Letter, though he come short of the best sense, and that there might be a
better gi^en, he is not therefore to be thought to have erred, or not to have
fulfilled the office of a good interpreter. For so plentiful and profound is
the sense of holy Scripture, especially in such places as are ob^cure, as it is
not easy for any man to judge, which is the best sense. Nay if we must
interpret a new, until we have found out the best sense, there will never be
a^ end of interpreting, but we must every year set forth a new inter^^^tation,
or at least correct and amend the ^ormer, as our Adversaries have done, and
Bezw by name, who having set out five diverse editions of the new Testament
every one much differing from the other, (...) 1598.
as himself freely confesteth, yet he plainly acknowledges that in his first
edition he has neither satisfied either the greatness of the work, or his own
desire. Out of which ground we answer to that which our Adversaries object: to
wit, that there are many places of the vulgar Edition which might much better
and much more clearly have been translate^: for it is sufficient that they are
well and rightly translated.

5. The fourth ground. We are not to reprehend the translations of holy
Scripture, only because they differ one from another, so long as they are not
contrary the one to the other: and in this the holy Scripture differs from
other profane writings. For even as the holy Ghost in diverse places of holy
Scripture teaches things different, but not repugnant: so the same holy Ghost
can in one place and in the same words teach diverse things. And heerehence it
is, 1. p. q. 1^ art. vlt.
that S. Thomas teaches well, as did S. Augustine before him, that of one and
the same p^ace of Scripture, there may be many litterall senses. For whereas
the litterall sense is that which the author intends, and the proper and
chief author of the holy Scripture is God himself whose intention and meaning
is not tied to one verity only, as is man's understanding, but he in one and the
same moment comprehends all things; there is no doubt, but that he in the
same words and at the same time, can intimate unto us diverse things.

6. The which thing is excellently declared by S. Augustine, Aug. l. 12.
confess. cap. vltimo.
for having said that he thought Moses intended diverse senses in his words, he
corrects himself saying, that without all doubt God who is the principal
author of the Scriptures did so. O lord, says he, seeing thou art God and not
flesh and blo^d, if man be short sig^ted, can it be hidden from the spirit
which will lead me into the right land, whatsoever thoug mast in those words to
reueate to posterity, howsoever he by whom they were sp^ken, though per
adueenture but of one seem only, (...) many other no less true, so S.
Augustin^ seeing there^or^ there are diverse litterall seme^ of one and the same
place, one interpreter may follow one sense, and another (...) another, so long
as neither of them do say any thing not agreeable to the word of God, but both
the one sense and the other is godly, and conformable to other places of
Scripture: and this makes much for the dignity of the Scriptures, and profit
of the Church, according to that which S. Augustine writes elsewhere: Lib. 3.
de Doct. Christ. c. 27.
How could God (says he) better commend unto us the plentiful fruit of his
Divine words, then by so disposing, as the same words may be understood diverse
ways.

7. Nay we see moreover the holy Scripture it self to show very manifestly,
that there are diverse senses of the same words. For there is no doubt, but
that commaundment o^ Deutero^omy, Deuteronomy. 25. v. 4.
Thou shall not tie the mouth of the Ox that thresheth, according to the
litterall sense, does signify that the mouth of an ox is not to be tied whilst
he treads forth the corn in the floare, for so according to the Letter the
Jews observed it, as indeed they were bound to do. 2. Cor. 9. v. 9. 10.
Neuerth^les S. Paul manife^^ly reaches, that God the proper Author of the
holy Scripture, intended chie^ly another sense* Is God, says he, so careful
of Oxen, or does he not so say in regard of us, for indeed these things are
written for us; h^therto it also apper^ayneth that in the Hebrew tongue one
word has many ^ignifications, as has been showed in the seaue^th Chapter in
the Latin Edition.

8. Out of this ground we affirm, that there is no repugnance between the
Septuagint Interprters, and the Hebrew text, and between the Hebrew text and
the vulgar Edition, or lastly between the interpretation of the vulgar Edition
of the old Testament, and that of the new, how much soever the same words are
diversely translated, to wit, otherwise of the S^ptuagint, and otherwise of the
vulgar Latin interpreter, or otherwise of the vulgar Edition of the old
Testament, and otherwise of the vulgar Edition of the new, where in both places
the same words are cited, for the same places of Scripture are oftentimes
otherwise cited by the Apostles in the new Testament, then has the Hebrew text
of of the old. But here is diversity without any repugnance, or contrariety.
And this has place especially in the Hebrew text, because in the Hebrew tongue
there is so different reading of one and the same word. See examples hereof in
the Latin Edition of this Controversy, in this Chapter.

9. It will be easy out of that which has been said to answer that which our
Adversaries object against diverse places of the vulgar edition. For albeit
there be diversity between it, and the Hebrew text, there is no repugnance or
contrari^ty: and if our Adversaries think otherwise it proceeds from their
ignorance of the Hebrew tongue, which has many words subject to ambiguity,
and very many phrases much different from the Latin and Greek phrase, as in
the Chapters that follow may be seen in the Latin Edition from the 16. to the
20.

CHAP. IX.
The place of Genesis (she shall break thy head) is showed to be well
translated.
IT will be too long, and little to my purpose to examine all the places of the
vulgar Edition to which our Adversaries take exception, for many of them differ
little or nothing from the Hebrew text of the old Testament, or from the Greek
of new: we will handle some few of greatest difficulty, and which our
Adversaries do most often and with great bitterness urge against us, that by
them, judgment may be given of the rest which are of less importance.

2. The first place which they say is depraved, and or which they often and
eagerly complain, Lutherus and Lutherani in Genes. ib.
is that of the third of Genesis v. 15. Ipsa conteret caput tuum: for it is not
ipsa in the Hebrew, but ipsum. as if it were spoken of the seed of the woman
and not of the woman her self. The Lutherans cry out of great injury done
thereby to Christ, as to whom alone it appertains to bruze the head of the
Devil which we attribute to another, to wit, to the Blessed Virgin.

3. Calvin also affirms, that we have found out a sacrilegious exposition,
whilst we accommodate that to the holy Mother of Christ which was spoken of the
seed, Calu. in c. ^. Genesis v. 1^.
Christ himself. And as for the Lutherans we have less cause to blame the^
for reprehending our version, seeing they stoutly mantayne, that by the seed of
the woman Christ only is meant.

4. But as for Calvin, he shows the greedy appetite he has to calumniate
when he calls our version a sacrilegious exposition, for he convinced by the
truth, confesses that by the seed of the woman not only Christ is meant, but
all his member^ yea even all mankind. It is therefore wonderful that he says,
it is a sacrilegious exposition, to apply to the Blessed Virgin Mary that which
was spoken of the seed, unless he will not that the Blessed Virgin be any
member of Christ, or to appertayn^ any thing to mankind. For seeing that the
promise of bruzing Satha^s head appertains to Christ, and every member of his
(as Calvin writes in express words) it must doubtless principally
appertain to the Blessed Virgin, Calu. l. 1. Inst. c. 14* sect. 18.
as who next after Christ, has most strongly crushed Satan's head. Hunnius in
Caluino Iudaiza^te, and in ^^nti-pareo.
Wherefore even the Lutherans themselves observe, that Calvin ha^h no reason to
object this unto the Catholics.

5. But to the end we may the better understand whether it be any fault at all,
that we retain in the vulgar version the particle (ipsa) we are first to
declare the literal sense of this place, and to examine after, whether it be
any error that we retain the particle (ipsa) in our version. For it was not
out of any ignorance or drowsy carelesnes, that the feminine gender crept in
here, instead of the masculine, or neuter, In Genes. loco citato
as Calvin calumniateth, but it was done of purpose, and for just cause, as
shall be showed.

CHAP. X.
Of the true sense of these words: Ipsa conteret etc.
THAT we may find out the true sense of these words, we must first re^ute the
f^lse expositions of our Adversaries. The Luthera^s by the seed of the woman
will needs have Christ only to be mean^: we confess indeed that he is
principally meant thereby, and that therefore the place may be well understood
of Christ, as many ancient Fathers have expounded it, but that Christ alone is
meant hereby, and not his members we deny to be the literal sense for the
reasons following.

2. First it is evident that the seed of the Serpent which is opposed against
the seed of the woman, does not signify any one Serpent, but a multitude: it is
therefore very probable, that by the seed of the woman a multitude also is
signified, unless we will have the Scripture in so few words speak
ambiguously. Moreover semen is a Nowne collectiue properly signifying a
multitude, neither is there any thing in this sentence that forces us to
depart from the proper signification of the Word. This reason is of so great a
force, that C^luin was moved thereby to forsake the exposition of the Lutherans,
which he would otherwise willingly have embraced the more strongly to assault
us, for thus he writes: Some make no doubt but Christ alone is meant by the
seed of the woman, whose exposition I could willingly approve, Calu. in Genesis
loco citato.
but that I see they offer too great violence to the word (seed) for who will
grant, that a Nowne collectiue is to be taken for one man only? Thus Calvin.
So strong is the truth, that it extorteth a true confession from her greatest
enemy.

3. Secondly it is said of the seed of the woman, that it shall crush, and
bruze the head of the Serpent, but this crushing and bruzing the Scripture does
not attribute to Christ alone, but to all that lead a godly life in him, for to
every just man the holy Ghost speaks, saying: thou shall walk over the Addar
and Basiliske, Psalm. 90* v 13.
and thou shall tread under thy seete the Lion and the Dragon. And Christ says
unto his Disciples: Behold I have given you power to tread upon the Serpents
and Scorpions, Luc. 10. v. 19.
and upon all the power of the enemy. And the Apostle to the Romans prays
saying. The God of peace crush Satan under your feet quickly. And lastly in
very many places of Scripture the faithful are said to over come the Devil,
Romans 16. v. 20.
and to get victories against him, which is all one as to crush him. Seeing
therefore the proper work of this seed agrees also to the members of Christ,
1. Joan. 2. v 13.
the Word seed is not to be limited to Christ alone. Apoc. 12. v. 11.
Ad hereunto that God in these words intended to comfort not only Eve deceived
by the craft of the Devil, 1. Cor. 15. v. 57.
but all her posterity. Now the comfort is more general, if all the faithful
should be able by Christ to overcome the Devil, then if that Christ alone
should overcome him, even as our comfort is greater that we together with
Christ shall rise again, then if Christ only should rise, and he alone attain
to eternal life.

4. Thirdly. Albeit we should grant our Adversaries, that Christ alone does
crush the head of the Devil, which is the former part of the sentence: yet the
latter part can by no means be applied to Christ alone, where it is said, that
the Devil shall crush this seed, for Christ in his own person cannot be
crushed by the Devil: we must therefore needs by this seed understand also
the members of Christ, for in the Hebrew text it is thus word for word, ipsa,
velipsum, co^teret te in capite, and tu contere^ cum, vel eam, in calcaneo, for
the Hebrew word is the same in both places both in the first and in the later
part of the sentence, and signifies c^nterere.

5. As for Caluins exposition interpreting by the seed of the woman all man
kind; In Genesis Ioco citato and l. 2.
it is not to be received, for God in this place denounces emnity between the
seed of the Serpent, Instit. c. ^3. sect. 2.
and the seed of the woman, but infidells and ungoodly persons have no emnity
with the Devil, and his seed, but are rather the seed and sons of the
Devil, according to those words of Christ: Joan. 8. v. 44.
You are of your father the Devil; they therefore cannot appertain to this
seed of the woman.

6. But whereas Calvin in another place says, Calvin l. 1. Instit. c. 14.
sect. 18.
that Christ and his members are signified by the seed of the woman, we like
well of that his saying, for it is the exposition of the Catholic and ancient
Fathers, and indeed the true litterall sense.

7. For in that sentence God says, first that he will put emnity, wherefore he
speaks not of any natural emnity, as Calvin insinuates, but of a
supernatural proceeding from God. Moreover God signifies between whom this
emnity shall be, to wit, between the Serpent and woman. Now as by the Serpent
the Devil is meant, whom that natural Serpent represented, and in whom God
laid his curse upon the Devil: so by the woman Eve, is meant the spouse of
Christ, or his true Church represented by Eve, whose force and victory against
the Devil was therefore foretold by God: Ephesians. 5. v. 32. 2. Cor. 11. v. 2.
and 3.
for that Eve represented the Church, as Adam did Christ, the Apostle plainly
teaches in his Epistle to the Ephesians. and the same Apostle does therefore
elsewhere expound this place of Satan, and the Church, Apoc. ^. v. 13. 17.
as does S. John in his Apocalypse where he declares this emnity between the
woman and the Serpent, to be indeed the emnity between the Church of Christ
and the Devil: wherefore here by the Serpent is signified the Devil by the
woman the Church, by the seed of the Serpent the Children of the Devil, and
all the wicked who are aliens from Christ and his Church, but especially such
as seduce others and oppugn the Church. Matt. 13. v. 38.
The seed of the woman are the Children of the Church, Apocal. 12. v. 17.
especially such as keep Gods commaundments, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ, as S. John speaks.

8. Furthermore, this woman, to wit the Church shall crush the head of the
Serpent, Psalm. 90. v. 13. Luc. 10. v. 19. Romans 16. v. 20.
as we have proved by many places of Scripture. But on the other side the
woman's heel shall be crushed by Satan, for the Church overcomes the Devil by
her chief and more excellent members, but she is overcome in such her members
as are base and worldly given, which set up their rest here upon earth, and
taste no other things but such as are terrene and earthly, Defuga. saeculi c. 7.
worthily therefore signified by the heel of the Church; let us not therefore,
says S. Ambrose, walk by love and affection vpont he earth, and the Serpent
cannot hurt us. In the first combat is that the Church over comes by open
war, and therefore it is expressed by crushing of the head. In the later
combat in which a part of the Church is overcome, the enemy proceeds by
guiles and deceites, and therefore that combat is signified by crushing the
heel, for the Hebrew word signifying calcaneum, Oleoster in c. 3. Genesis
does signify also properly insiaiari, and ex insidijs aggredi, as appears by
many places of Scripture. And out of ignorance heerof Calvin without cause
reprehendeth the vulgar interpreter, for otherwise explicating this combat in
the later part of the sentence then he had in the former, for the Emphasis, or
force of the Hebrew word required that he should interpret the later part as
he did by these words, tu insidiaberis calcaneo eius, which is as much to say,
as thou shall crush her heel, not by open war, but by taking her at
unawares. See further of this matter in this Chapter in the Latin Edition the
8.. And you shall see that our Adversaries make a great ado about a matter of
small moment, if the words be rightly understood. For whether we read ipsa,
and so refer it to the Church, or ipsum, that it may be referred to the
children of the Church, the sense is all one, for it is all on to say, the seed
of the woman shall crush the head of the Serpent, or the Children of the Church
shall do it. And heerehence it i^, that the ancient Fathers, whether they
read ipse, as S. Hierome, Hier. in tradit.
and S. Chrysostom do, or ipsa, as read S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Gregory,
Hebraicis. Homil. 17. in Genesis
and other Latin Fathers, all of them expound this place of the Church.

9. Howsoever it be, Amb. de fuga saeculi c. 7.
the reading of the vulgar Edition is to be preferred before the other, for
this victory is rather to be attributed to the Church, Greg. in Job. c. 38.
as to the Mother of all the faithful, and to her who continues for ever,
according to that promise of Christ, the gates of hell shall not prevail
against her, then to her children or members, which are every day changed, for
this promise is an explication of the promise made by God in Genesis, for the
head of the Serpent, and the gates of hell signify one and the same thing.
Matt. 1^. v. 18.
And if the victory be attributed to the woman, that is, to the Church, all
things are better explicated, for God first did foretell the emnity that was
to be between the woman and the Serpent, and afterward he makes mention of
the seed of the woman, and the Serpents seed, so as the woman is opposed to
the Serpent, and the seed of the one to the seed of the other; but the
victory pro^^sed, is said to be gotten against the Serpent himself, and not
against the seed: wherefore the same appertains rather to the woman her self
then to her seed, for the words following (between thy seed and her seed) do
not properly signify any new combat, but a continuance of that combat which was
between the woman and the Serpent, and are put in by way of pare^thesis, for
the combat of the Church and of her children is all one combat.

10. But the chief cause that moved the Church to retain at this time rather
the word ipsa, then ipsum, or ipse, was to control the error of the Lutherans,
for if the reading had been ipsum, or ipse, one might have thought this promise
to have appertayned only to Christ, as they (though erroneously) would have it,
but by reading ipsa, this promise must needs be understood to have been made to
the whole Church. For such is the custom of the holy Church, whether she
interpret the Scripturs or administer the Sacraments to do all as is most
profitable and most for the edification of the faithful. Neither is Christ
hereby excluded but he is rather included in the name of the Church, as is also
the holy Ghost, for the true Church of Christ cannot consist or do anything
that is good without the help of her supreme head Christ and the assistance of
his holy spirit. That the reading according to the Hebrew text i^ ipsa, or
ipsissima, and not ipsum, or ipse is learnedly proved in the next Chapter of
the Latin Edition of this Controversy, to which I refer the Reader, and to
the Chapters following, in which other places of the vulgar Edition are
defended.

CHAP. XI.
That the written Word is no fit Judge of Controversies, concerning matters of
faith.
OUR Adversaries in the beginning did stiffly mayntaine that the holy Scripture
was to be the only judge of all Controversies which arise in matters of faith,
but when they were told, that to make the Scripture a judge was as much as to
say, the Scripture did hear, speak, and live, for all these appertain to a
judge, and that nothing is more unreasonable the^ to assign such a judge of
Controversies, as can neither hear, nor speak, but is utterly void of l^^e;
Iunius co^tra Bell.
changing their opinion. They begin now to ^ay that the Scripture is improperly
called a judge, Cont. 1. l. 3. c. 3. nota 9. etc. 9. nota 8. and 10.
and that to speak properly, the holy Ghost only is the judge. And thus having
for many years together spoken improperly, now a^ last they fly to the holy
Ghost, of whom there is no doubt, Robertus Rolocc. de vocation^ effic. c. 15.
but that he is the supreme judge of all.

2. But they should have added further that the holy Ghost at this time does
not immediately propose any new revelations to any particular man concerning
points of faith, but only proposes veri^ies already revealed, and that by the
mouth of the Church, as shall be showed hereafter in the next Controversy where
we shall have occasion to say more of this matter. Whosoever therefore
contemns the judgment of the Church, in so doing, he despises the judgment
of Christ, and of the holy Ghost, for Christ himself says, he that despyseth
you, despyseth me. Neither does the holy Ghost speak by the Scripture but when
it is rightly understood, Luc. 10. v. 16.
which is never but when we embrace the interpretation of the Catholic Church,
as we have already showed in the fourth Chapter.

CHAP. XII.
Whether the Scripture be obscure or hard to be understood.
THE Word of God is either written, or unwritten and preached. Now certain it
is, that the Word preached is not obscure, for it is not hidden from such as
perish: the question thefore is of the written Word. ^. Cor. 4. v. 3.
Our Adversaries in the beginning did teach that the whole Scripture was easy,
and no part thereof hard to be understood, but after that not only many obscure
places, but even whole Chapters out of the Canticle of Canticles, out of
Izechiel, and other Prophets were objected by the Catholics, Beza de notis
Eccl. Volu. 3. p. 137. edit. ann. 1582.
they changing their mind confess that very many places of Scripture are
obscure, but that all points of doctrine necessary to salvation, are be ^ound
in places plains and easy,

2. For resolution of this question, we must answer with a distinction, and
say, that if the word Scripture be taken for the bare Letter only, then
doubtless the Scripture is obscure, ^. Cor. 3. v. 6. 7. 9.
or else S. Paul would not have said, that it kills and causes death and
damnation; but if it be taken properly, that is to say, together with the true
sense and meaning thereof, then it is not obscure but plain enough in all
things necessary to salvation, and in this sense speaks S. Augustine, l. 3.
de doct. Christiana c. 7. and 9*
as do also other Fathers whom our Adversaries cite when they say, that al
things necessary to salvation are manifestly contained in the holy Scripture.

3. Moreover the holy Scripture is both manifest, and obscure, but not in
regard of the same persons. It is passing obscure and not to be understood of
the proud, such I mean, as despise the sense and consent of the holy Fathers,
yea and of the whole Catholic Church, but to little ones and such as are
humble who follow in all things the foresaid sense and consent, Psalm. 18. v. 8.
it is manifest and perspicuous. The testimony of our Lord is faithful (says
the Psalmist) giving wisdom to the little ones, that is, to such as are
humble and not proud: and Christ our Lord says, Matthew. 11. v. 25.
thou have hidden these things from the wise, and revealed them to little
ones, that is to the humble. The Scripture indeed is obscure to such as want
faith, and are destitute of the holy Ghost, but easy and plain to those which
abide and persevere in the faith of the Church, and by that means are guided
and governed by the holy Ghost. 4. The Word of God shines brightly, the Word
of God, I say, not the word of men, not the word of the Devil, for that only
is the true Word of God which is in the true sense and not in the bare letter;
for the letter depraved by a false sense is not the Word of God, but the word
of men or rather the word of the Devil: the word of God does illuminate the
eyes, but the eyes of such as have eyes to see, and not their eyes, 2. Cor. 4.
v. 4.
whose minds Satan has blinded, so as the light of the Gospel cannot shine
to them.

5. In vain therefore do our Adversaries heap together so many places of
Scripture, in which it is said, that the Word of God is said to be clear, full
of light, and perspicuous, for this is not attributed by the Scripture to the
bare letter, but to the letter joined with the true sense, which true sense
cannot be had out of the Catholic Church.

6. Neither does the Scripture say, that the Word of God is manifest to all
indifferently, but to such only, as being endued with the true faith, are
humble o^ heart, and therefore inspired by the holy Ghost; if therefore our
Adversaries will have the Scripture to be full of light, and easy to be
understood of them, it is necessary that they return again to the true
Church, in which only is true faith, (...) humility, the true sense of the
Scripture, and the true spirit of God, without whi^^ the holy Scripture will
never be plain, clear and manifest: for it is great imprudency, I will not
say impudency, to contend so eagerly and with such hostility about the
plainenes and perspicuity of the holy Scripture, and to have no will to return
into that way, the which only leads to that plainenes and perspicuity.

CHAP. XIII.
Whether the holy Scripture be to be translated into the vulgar tongue.
THAT we may briefly dispatch that which has been so largely treated of by
many concerning this matter, we will reduce all unto four general assertions.
The first is; There is not doubt but the Word of God is to be preached to the
people in the vulgar tongue, so as the question is only of the bare written
letter.

2. The second assertion is; Neither the example of Christ, nor of the
Primitive Church do convince that the Scripture is to be translated into the
vulgar tongue, but rather the contrary, for Christ never commanded the Jews
to translate the Scriptures out of the Hebrew tongue into the Syriac, and yet
in Christ's time the ancient Hebrew tongue was to the Jews as the Latin is to
the French, Italians, and Spaniards, and only the Syriac tongue was in use
amongst the common people, which even our Aduersaris confess, such I mean as
are the more skillfull in the Syriac, and Hebrew tongue, as namely these,
Sebastian Munster in his preface before his Siriacal and Chalda^cal Grammar,
Francis Iunius in his preface before the new Testament in the Syriac tongue of
Termel^^^, Peter Martin Morentine of Navarre in the preface of his Caldaicall
Grammar printed at Rochell the year 1590.

3. Neither did S. Paul write in Latin to the Romans but in Greek, though not
the Greek tongue but the Latin was their vulgar tongue. Hier. de Script.
So S. Luke did write the acts of the Apostles at Rome in Greek and not in
Latin. Eccles. in Luca. See S. Aug. l. 2. de doct. Christ. c. 11. and seq ^
And even to S. Augustines time four hundred years after Christ, the Bible
was not extant but in the three learned tongues, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, no
not in the time of Rabbanus Maurus, who lived eight hundred years after
Christ, as himself testifyeth in express words.

4. Neither can our Adversaries allege any authentical example of the
ancient Church for the translation of the Scripture into the vulgar tongue:
Rabb. l. 5. de inst. Cler. c. 8.
they tell us indeed of one Vulphilas a Bishop of the Goths who is said to
have translated the Scripture into the Gothish tongue, but he was not a
Catholic, but an Arian Heretic, Theod. lib. 4. hist. Ecc. c. vlt. Socrat.
lib. 4. c. 27. Sozom l. 6. c. 37. Cass. in hist. ^ripart. l. 8. c. 13.
as witness Theodoret, Socrates, Sozomenus, and Cassiodorus.

5. For as for that which certain late writers allege of S. Chrysostom his
translating of the Scripture into the Armenian tongue, as also of S. Hierome
his translating of the same into the Dalmatical tongue, there can no certain
proof be brought thereof. And they who write this, do not affirm, that all
the Scripture was translated by them, but certain parts only used of old to
be read in the prayers of the Church, as the Psalms, Epistles, Ghospels, and
Lessons which were song publickely at Mass, and in the Canonical hours.
which we read to have been granted by Pope John the eight of that name, to the
Morauian^ at their first conversion to the faith of Christ, but this was 880.
years after Christ, and this custom was of no long continuance amongst them,
as appears by that which Pope Gregory the seventh writes to the Duke of
Bohemia, Baron. Tom. 10. ann. 880. n. 19. and Tom. 11. ann. 1080. n. 1.
and is to be seen in Caesar Baronius.

6. The third assertion; To translate the Scripture into the vulgar tongue is
neither in it self unlawful, nor forbidden by any Ecclesiastical law, so it
be truly translated. Nay such a translation serves Preachers to great use, who
are to cite and expound the Scriptures to the people in the vulgar tongue.
Heretical translations are indeed forbidden, especially of the new Testament,
because in them many places of holy Scripture are by false translating
corrupted.

7. The fourth assertion; It is not a thing profitable to all to read the
Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, yea to many it is rather pernicious, for we
are taught by the Apostle S. Peter, 2. Pet. vlt. v. 26.
that in the Scriptures are many things hard to be understood, which
unlearned, and unstayed persons deprave to their own destruction. Many also
there are incapable of meat and solid sustenance, who are therefore to be fed
with milk, 1. Cor. 3. v. 2. Heb. 5. v. 12.
as the Apostle speaks, and for such it is more wholesome to be fed by the
sermons and instructions of their Pastors, then to feed themselves with
reading the Bible. It was therefore great prudence of the Church to forbid that
the Bible, though translated and set forth by Catholics, should be read of all
indifferently, Index. lib. prohibit. Reg. 4.
and without the approbation and leave of the Bishop, Pastor, or Ghostly Father.

8. Our Adversaries object certain places of S. Chrysostom, and S. Hierome, in
which they exhort to the reading of the Scripture, but they should have
observed that those Fathers speak of reading the Scripture in the Greek
tongue then extant, or in the Latin according to the old edition, which was
never forbidden to any by the Church: whereas our Controversy is about the
translations of the holy Scripture out of the Hebrew, Greek and Latin into the
vulgar tongue, which are all for the most part corrupted.

9. And it is worth the nothing, that our Adversaries spend their time in
vain, in gathering together arguments by which to persuade men that it is
necessary for them to read the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, to the end they
may learn out of them what they must necessarily know if they will be saved, for
how truly or plainly soever they be translated no man shall ever recevue any
fruit by them, unless he first believe aright, and be guided by the holy
Ghost, to whom it appertains to guide us into the right land, Psalm. 142. v.
8. and 10.
to make known unto us the way in which we are to walk, to teach us the will
of God which we are to fulfill. Which is manifestly to be seen in the Jews
who understand the Hebrew text much better then Christians, in which there is
so ample and clear mention of Christ, and yet for all that they do not believe
in Christ-Our Adversaries therefore have little reason to keep such a do about
the words of Scripture, or the translation of them, let them first embrace the
true Faith which is in the Church only, let them seek after the holy Ghost who
is not to be found out of the Church, let them seek out the true sense of the
Letter, which the Church only conserueth uncorrupted, and it will easily be
granted unto them to have the Scriptures in what tongue soever they will, so
they be truly and vncorruptedly translated, and that they use them to their
own salvation, and not to their destruction, as many do, whereof we have for
witnesses not only the Scripture but daily experience, and this shall suffice
concerning the translation of the Scripture into the vulgar tongue.

10. For of the prayers in Latin either privately made by the people, or
publicly offered by the Priest at mass, and in the administration of the
Sacraments, we will treat hereafter in their proper places.

CHAP. XIIII.
That our Adversaries use many sleightes in corrupting the Word of God.
OUR Adversaries often require us to prove all that which we say out of the
written Word of God, but when we cite the same in express terms they have
many ways by which they deprave it. Wherefore before I make an end of this
Controversy concerning the written Word, it shall not be from the purpose
briefly to detect such their corruptions; partly to the end that no man be
deceived by them, and partly that every man may understand nothing to be so
plainly and clearly set down in the written Word, which by the Commentaries
of crafty and subtle wits may not be weakened and made of little force, if no
regard be had to the authority and judgment of the Church. And that no man may
think that I herin calumniate them or deal less sincerely with them, I will
set down out of their own writings some one or two exa^pls of each manner of
corrupting, whereof many examples will occure in each Controversy.

2. The first manner of shifting of places alleged out of the written Word
is, to say, that the original text is corrupted, and what is alleged crept
out of the margent into the text, whereof see many examples in the 12. and 18.
Chapter of the Latin Edition of this Co^trouersy.

3. Their second shift is to reject the vulgar translation and instead thereof
to cite some new and corrupt translation of their own. It is evident enough,
that Luther in his first version of the new Testament into the Germane tongue,
Ioannes Coclaus de actis Luther. ann. 1522.
set forth in the year 1522. has more then a thousand errors, as many have
observed, amongst which, neither the last, nor the least is his presuming to ad
to the text of S. Paul the 3. Chapter and 28. verse, the particle alone,
thereby the stronglier to establish his doctrine, that Faith alone justifies,
for this place of the Apostle, We think a man is justified by faith, he
tra^slateth by faith alone: and when a certain friend of his to whom the same
was objected by a Catholic asked the cause why he so translated it, Romans 3 v.
28.
he no less ridiculously then proudly answers, in a certain little book
set forth by him in the year 1530. under this title: A certain information or
answer made to two questions proposed by a certain good friend concerning the
translation of Scripture, and the invocation of Saints. Luth. To. 4. Germ.
excuso VVi^emb. anno 1551. fol. 475. page 2.
In which he advises his friend to answer the Catholics objection after this
manner. D. Martin Luther will have it so, and sa^^h, that a Papist and an Ass
is all one thing: so I will, so I command, let my will stand for a reason, for
we will not be the Papists scholars, but their Judges. Luther will have it so,
and he says, that he is a Doctor above all the Popes Doctors. So Luther,
concluding at last that the word (alone) shall remain in his new Testament,
though it should make all his Adversaries mad: and he adds further, that he
is only sorry, that he had not added two words more to the text, and translated
it after this manner* we are ius^ifyed by only faith without any works of any
law.

4. Zwinglius also who first in our age endeauored to persuade many, that the
body of Christ is not really contained in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the
better to establish this his error, goes about to prove that those words of
Christ, this is my body, are very well translated thus, this signifies my
body, Zuingl. de vera and falsa relig. c. de Eu^b. par. 262. in lib. excuso
Tuguri. 1555.
and with this his new translation he is so ravished, as if he had received the
same from heaven, for these are his word^: So therefore has Luke, with whom
we content our selves, without citing any other Evangelist. And having taken
bread he gave thanks, brake it, and gave it them, saying, this signifies my
body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me. Thou see O
faithful soul, but yet wrapped in absurd opinions, how all things here
agree, and nothing inviolently either taken away or added, so as thou have
cause to wonder, that thou have not been always of this opinion, and much more
that any dare so boldly tear and rent the body of this speech so well joined
together. So Zwinglius in the praise of his new translation, wherein he
arrogates more authority to himself, the^ is due, so as that of Cicero in his
book de diuinatione may well be applied to him, I never saw any man arrogate
greater authority to himself, and in the end say just nothing.

5. Moreover concerning Caluins and Bezas errors in translating or rather
perverting the holy Scriptures, Calu. l. ^. insti^. c. 16. a sect. 10 ad ^3.
and in c. 26. Matt. v. 39. and in c. 27.
whole books are extant, as also of the corruptions of the Geneua Bylles, which
are every year increased, but this shall much more commodiously be declared
hereafter in the particular Controversies. Matthew. v. 46. Item i^ Catech Domi.
10.
We will only here set down one example of a corruption to be found in
Caluins, Beza in c. ^. ad Heb. v. 7. and in (...) mai^ore Catech sm. Calu. c.
16. ^it. sect. 10 in ^ine.
Bezas, and all the Geneua Bybles. And this corruption is forged a purpose by
them to confirm a new and notable blasphemy against Christ and himself, by
some apparent testimony of Scripture, for they reach in many places that Christ
when he prayed in the Garden was seized with an extreme fear, Beza in maiori
Catechis. Vol. ^. tract. Theol.
least God being angry with him for our sins, for which he had taken upon him
to satisfy, should inflict upon him eternal damnation, neither did Christ
fear without cause, page 657. ^uxta edit. Geneuens. (...) 1582. apud.
Eu^tathium Vignon.
for they say he suffered upon the Cross the pains of a damned person, and
the torments of hell; for these are the impions words of Calvin: Christ
suffered in his soul the torments of a forlorn, and damned man: and Beza
says, at what time Christ hang upon the Cross, he was in the midst even of
the torments of hell, which is as much, as to say, that God himself was not
only afraid of the torments of hell, but that he suffered and endured them, for
it is evident that Christ was true God. But against these absurd paradoxes we
are to dispute hereafter. It shall suffice here to show, that they have
depraved the holy Scripture, to (...) this their impious assertion, for whereas
it is written in the fifth to the Hebrews, Heb. 5. v. 7.
and 7. v. that Christ was heard of God for his reverence, Calvin first, and
after Beza, and all the Geneua Bybles, make the text to say, Christ was heard
by reason of his fear, or because he was afraid, but that in the last Edition
Beza has added more words to the text, Beza annot. ann^ 1598.
making it sound thus: His prayers being heard he was delivered from this
fear. Moreover Calvin in his commentaris and Beza in his annotations seek to
prove out of this text, that Christ feared eternal damnation, and that he was
delivered out of this fear by his prayers which he offered with tears: true
it is that in the French Bybles lately printed at Geneua, the year 1^05. they
have put in the margent, vel pro sua reuerentia, where enforced by truth they
manifestly contradict Calvin and Beza, who plainly deny that this place is so
to be translated, yet least their inconstancy should be noted, they leave the
former words in the text (ayant este exauce (...) qu'il craignoit) that is in
latin, exauditus est eo, vel in eo, quod timuit.

6. But all others as well Catholics as their Adversaries who have written
before Calvin, translate prosua reuerentia, vel propietate sua, as Erasmus,
Bucer, the Tiguriues in their bibles of the year 1542. Nay Sebastian Castalio
for this cause sharply reprehendeth Beza, Castal. in de^en. suae translationes
^ibli. in ^ine.
who glories that Calvin was the first that found out this new explication, in
a note of his upon this 7. v. se his editions of the year 1560. and 1565.

7. The third shift is, their false exposition of the text though never so
truly translated, for by diverse commentaries and little notes in the margent,
they go about to persuade the Readers the clean contrary to that which is
expressly in the text: see examples hereof in this Chapter in the latin
edition.

CHAP. XV.
The fourth, fifth, and sixth shift that our Adversaries use in deprauing the
Word of God.
THE fourth shift of our Adversaries is to fly to figurative and metaphorical
speeches, for it is most true that was wit^^ly observed by S. Augustine. Aug.
l. 3 de doctrine. a Christ. cap. 10.
If (says he) the mind be preoccupated with any erroneous opinion, whatsoever
the Scripture says to the contrary, men take to be a figurative speech. And
surely there is no kind of figurative speaking to which our Adversaries at one
time or another have not recouse: but there are three figures of which our
Adversaries do o^tenest serve themselves in deprauing the holy Scriptures,
which are these, Me^onymia, Hyperbole, and Ironia, Metonymia is a figure very
familiar with Calvin, Matt. 26. v. 26. Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 17. sect. 21.
for by it he peruerteth many places of Scripture, yea even those plain words
of Christ, this is my body: for having disputed long about the sense of those
words at last he concludes thus: I omit (says he) Allegories and Parables,
least any man should think that, I seek euasions, and to go from the matter
in hand, I say it is a Metonymicall speech. So Calvin.

2. By the figure Hyperbole our Adversaries shift of all those so evident
testimonies, by which we prove that remisof sins is obtained of God by good
works, Tob. 4. v. 11.
as are these: Alms delivers from all sin, Tob. 12. v. 9.
and death, and suffers not the soul to go into darkness. And again, Alms
delivers from death, Eccl. 3. v. 33.
and it is that that purges sin and makes us find mercy and life
everlasting. Moreover water puts out a burning fire, and Alms resists
sin: for the Lutherans say, that all these are Hyperbolicall speeches. Apol.
confess. Augustanae tit. de iustif.
Beza also seeks to extenuat by the figure Hyperbole that which the Apostle
writes in the praise of the Roman Church, Romans 1. v. 8. Beza ibid.
when he says, your haith is preached all over tse world. Calvin in like
manner by the same figure not only depraueth many places of the ancient
Fathers, Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14. sect. vlt.
but will needs force Christ himself without any need at all, to speak
Hyperbolically. And finally Philip Melancthon goes about by the figure Ironia
to delude those manifest words of Christ, Calu. in c. 6. Matt. v. 16. and in
c. 24. v. 82.
that which remains, give Alms, Luc. 11. v. 41. Phil. in apol. Confess. Aug.
tit. de iustif.
and behold all things are clean unto you. For Philip contendeth that Christ
spoke not those words in earnest, but in jest, which he took from Erasmus, as
he did many other things, but Calvin and Beza confess, Erasmus in a^not. Luc.
Calu. and Beza in illa verba S. Luc.
that this is a foolish Ironia. Albeit they also pervert the same words
another way, for they restrain the word omnia, only to meat.

3. The fifth shift is, when Catholics allege plain places of Scripture which
admit no figure, to say that the Scripture, yea even Christ himself did speak
exactly, but after a gross and popular manner, the meaning is, that he
speaks only probably, and not solidly. For example sake when we prove that
the Sacrament of the Eucharist excels the Manna of the Jews by these words
of Christ, Joan. 6. v. 48. and 49.
your Fathers indeed have eaten Manna and are dead, this is the bread
descending from heaven, that if any man eat of it he dye not, Caluins answer
is, that Christ accommodated his speech to the gross conceit or opinion of
the Jews. l. 4. Instit c. 14. sect. 25.
When we prove the Exorzismes of the Church, by which she casts out devils,
to be holy, because Christ says, one Devil will not cast out another, Calvin
answers, we must remember (says he) that when Christ uses such proverbs,
Calu. in illum v. 25 Matthew. 12.
as are in use among the people, he uses them only, as probable conjectures,
and not as solid proofs. So he. No marvel therefore, if our Adversaries say
our arguments are not solid, seeing they write so much of Christ's own
arguments.

4. Their sixth shift is, to answer to such plain testimonies as are alleged
out of Scripture against their errors, that the Scripture speaks not simply,
that is to say, not truly, but according to the false opinion of them, against
whom it has to do, which indeed is nothing else, but to deny the Scripture.
This is an usual shift of Calvin who interprets to dispute by contention,
Call. l. 2. instit. c. 1^. sect. 7.
to be all one, as to disput not according to our own mind, but according to
their error, and foolish affection who obscure the light of the Gospel. So as
when we prove that our Sacraments excel the Sacraments of the old law, Coloss.
2. v. 17.
because S. Paul says, that the ceremonies of the Jews were shaddows of
things to come, but Christ the body it self. And again, that the Sacrifices
of the law could not make perfect according to conscience* Heb. 9 v. 9 and 13.
but served only to sanctification and cleansing of the flesh: and (...) that
they could not take away sin. Heb. 10. v. 11.
To all these places Calvin answers, Call. l. 4. Instit. c 14. sect 25.
we are, says he, to observe diligently that the Apostle S. Paul in all these
places speaks, not simpliciter, sed per contentionem, which what it is to
say, we have interpreted out of Calvin before.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the seventh and eight shift.
THEIR seventh shift is when they are urged with express words of Scripture
to say that they are to be understood before men, and not before God, or in
truth. This shift Calvin and Beza use often, for thus they rid themselves of
these places, Every branch that brings not forth fruit, in me, he will cut
off* Ioa^. 15. v. 2. Calu. Ibid.
Calvin h^^re co^tendeth that the evil which believe in God are in Christ only
in the estimation of men* and not indeed: whereof it follows, that the words
of Christ are thus to be understood, to wit, that the evil (...) indeed to men
to be in Christ, but are not so in truth.

2. That place also of S. James, Jacob. 2. 24 Beza Calu and ill^ v^rba.
Man is justified by works, and not by faith alone, is interpreted by Calvin
and Beza, and almost all other our Adversaries of justification only before
men, and not before God. See more examples in this Chapter in the latin edition.

3. The eight shift is, when they know not what to answer, to say it is an
improper speech, and by this occasion to change the words of the Scripture into
other words of their own forging. For when we c^te the words of Christ in
which a reward is promised to fasting and prayer, Calvin turns them of, Calu*
in c. 6. Matt. v. 4.
with this answer, when Christ, says he, promises a reward from God (...)
fasting, he speaks improperly, as is said a litte before. Concerning prayer,
likewise when to prove free will we allege those wor^s of Christ, Matt. 12 v.
33. Calu. ibid.
to wit, make the tree good, Calvin a^swereth, it is an improper speech.

CHAP. XVII.
Of the ninth and tenth shift.
THEIR ninth shift is, when the words of Scripture are so plain and manifest,
that they cannot otherwise escape, they say at last, that ^e Scripture
commends unto us a thing impossi^e: and to make this shift more probable ^hey
corrupt the text by adding the parti^^ (si) as if the Scripture spoke
conditionally, and not absolutely, for when we cite the places of Scripture in
which life everlasting is promised to such as keep Gods commandments, Matt.
19. v. 17.
as when Christ says, if thou will enter into life, keep the commandments;
Luc. 10. v. 28.
And again, do this and thou shall live. The answer of Calvin and Beza is,
Calu. in 19. Matt. v. 17.
that Christ in these words speaks of a thing impossible. Calvin upon the
former place writes thus: Some of the ancient Father^, says he, have
interpreted this place amiss, as do the Papists after them, as if Christ
should teach that we cold deserve life everlasting by keeping the law. And a
little after he concludes saying: This answer of Christ is according to the
old law, to wit that no man can be accounted just before God, but he who shall
satify the law, which is impossible. And upon the later place he writes this,
Calu in c. 16. Luc. v. 28.
it is impossible, says he, to fulfill what the law commands, Lib. 3.
Instit. c. 17. sect. 7.
yea it is a principal axione with Calvin. and a common a^swere to al such
^laces. A legal promise, says he, a^nexed to a condtion impossible proves
nothing, and thus with such impossibilities he dallieth with us, and with the
holy Scripture it self: so far forth, ^s they dare affirm, that the Apostle
in one Chapter avouches unto us seven times things impossible: Calu. and
Beza. in c. ^. ad Romans
for whereas the Apostle in the 2. cap. of the Ep. to the Romans and 6. affirms
first, that God will render t^ every one according to his works, the
interpret the place thus, that God will indeed give to me^ according to their
good works it there were any such, but that no man can do any good work before
God. Beza in c. ad Romans v. 6. annot. ^edit. annis 1550. 1564. 1565.
Is there any man, says Beza, that shall be able to bring these works which the
Apostle says shall be rewarde^ with eternal life? And whereas in the seaue^th v.
the Apostle says, that God does render life everlasting to such as seek the
same by the patience of good works, their answer is, that he insinuates a
thing impossible, and that no man can do any good work before God, no not the
iustest man, which is not worthy of eternal damnation. Whosoever, Calu. l. 3.
Instit c. 19^ sect. 4.
says Calvin, have made the greatest progress before all others in the way of
the Lord, if they cast their ^yes upon the Lord God, what work soever they
attempt or go about, they see into be accursed. And surely ^ for my part, could
easily believe that such is the progress of our adversaries in the way of our
Lord* See the rest of the Apostles places in the latin edition.

2. The tenth and last shift is the wresting of diverse words to a wrong sense,
and to invent sundry different understandings of the words, to build upon it
many interpretations never heard of before, and for a final Conclusion to say,
Luc. 22. v. 19.
the place is obscure, and therefore proves nothing. For example heerof, those
most evident words of Christ, this i^ my (...) with is given for you, may
suffice: for some of the^ wrest the pronowne hoc, others the word est, others
the word corpus, others the pronowne meum, others the relative quod, others the
prepositi^n pro, others the pronowne he vobis and others the Verb datur, and
(...) word they wrest diverse ways, so as one more then thirty years ago, Anno
2577.
has gathered out of their writings two hundred expositions of these few
words of Christ, of which (...) Xainctes (...) particularly 84. And that they
are both many, and different, yea repugnant, wherewith they labor to make
ob^cure these words of our Savior, no man can doubt. See another example in
the latin edition. And it is worthy of the noting, that in all these shi^fs
they serve themselves of other places of Scripture, to prove what they say:
whereby it may appear how easy a thing it is, to corrupt the Scripture by other
places of Scripture, but that the prouide^t and daily ca^e of the holy
Catholic Church opposes it self against such corruptions, ^. ad Tim. v. 25.
Matthew. ^8.
worthily therefore called the Pillar and firmament of truth, against which the
gates of hell shall never prevail.

FINIS.
