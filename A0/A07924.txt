The Complaint of the Shepherd Harp^^us.
To a pleasant new Tune.


Poor Harpalus, oppressed with love,
sat by a Cristall Brook:
Thinking his sorrows to remove,
often times therein to look:
And hearing how on pibble stones,
the murmuring river ran,
As if it had bewaild his groans,
unto it thus began.
Fair stream (quoth he) that pitties me,
and hear my matchless moan,
If thou be going to the Sea:
as I do now suppone,
Attend my plaints past all relief,
which dolefully I breath,
Acquaint the Sea-Nymphz with the grief*
which still procures my death.
Who sitting in the cliffie Rocks,
may in their songs express,
While as they comb their golden locks,
poor Harpalus distress:
And so parhaps some passenger,
that passes by the way,
May stay and listen for to hear
them sing this doleful Lay.
Poor Harpalus, a Shepherd Swain,
more rich in youth then store:
Loved fair Philena, hapless man,
Phulena, oh therefore.
Who still, remorslesse hearted maid,
took pleasure in his pain:
And his good will poor soul, repaid
with undeserved disdain.
Nere Shepherd loved a Shepherdess
more faithfully then he:
Nere Shepherd yet beloved less
of Shepherdess could be.
How often did he with dying looks,
to her his woes impart?
How often his sighs did testify
the dolor of his heart?
How often from Uallies to the Hills,
did he his grief rehearse?
How often re-ecchoed they his ills,
abacke again (alas?)
How often on Barks of stately Pines,
of Beech of Holly-greene,
Did he ingraue in mournful lines,
the grief he did sustain?
Yet all his plaints could have no place,
to change Philenas mind:
The more his sorrows did increase,
the more she proved unkind:
The thought thereof with wearied care,
poor Harpalus did move,
That overcome with high despair,
he lost both life and Love.
