To the right noble and virtuous Lady. Lady Anne, douchesse of Somerset etc,
her most bounden and daily Orator Gwalter Lynne wyshed abundance of all
grace and Godlynes with a long and prosperous estate, to Goddis honor and
your graces health and salvation.
Being credibly informed (most graciouse Lady) by such as be nygh about your
grace, that your graces chief and daily study is in the holy Bible: I
thought I could not present your grace with any Iuwell more acceptable and
pleasant to your grace then such a brief concordaunce. Whereby your grace
might with more redynes find all such things, as you should be desyrouse
to see. ^ctuum ^.a.
Then as for gold or silver I am not able to present unto your grace but my
ruyde labors and that I do with all my heart. When this little book therefore
came to my hand (being written in the high Almayne tongue) and I perceived it
to be most diligently gathered out of the holy Bible and set in such order
that with in it lyghtelly as much may be found by it, as by a great
concordaunce: I ceased not till I had it translated and set in like order in
the Englysh tongue, that your grace might not be destytute of so necessary an
instrumente in your godly study. And that all other which be studyouse of
godly knowledge might be the more desyrouse to have this little book and
embrace it with better will (knowing your graces fervent zeal in the
furtherynge of goddis truth.) I have (been as my duitie byndeth me so boulde as
to) dedycated unto your grace for to forther your grace in your godly study,
trustinge that your grace according to your a customable gentilnes will accept
my good will there in, and then shall I think my labors well employed and my
Pains well recompensed.

Now lest your grace should be disceyued in any thing contained in this
little book: Yt may pleace your grace to understand that the Psalms from the
nynth Psalm forward, are ever one fewer in number then the same Psalms be in
the Bybels which be translated and prynted into English. As for ensample, that
Psalm which in this book is noted.x. is in the Bibles.xi. and so forth to the
end of the Psalms, according to the count of the Greeks.

It behooves also, that your grace be admonyshed of this one other thing,
which other wise might hapely be a great trouble to your grace in the sekeynge
of matthers which ye shall desire to find. The letters A. B. C. D. E. F. G.
Which be commonly set in the margyne of every chappter of the Bible, to divide
the chapter into so many partis: Are not set in all Bybles a like. So that the
thing that in one book stands upon,B, or,C. does in an other book, stand
upon.D. or.E. And this dyuersytye is grown by the negligence (...) ^casyon of
many dowbts.

And as tochyng all other things necessary to be known about this book. I
desire your grace to take the pain to read over the preface followyng: which
the great lernyd men that were the first authors of the book did set before yt
unto the understanding of the Redar.

Now to speak some thing of the commodity and profit that spryngeth of
this book: I do your grace to understand that from the first beginning of
learning, all learned men have thought it so necesserie a thing to the
forderaunce of their study, that if they could by no mean^s have the like
that were some what to their mind: they would not stycke to take the pains
to draw out one for their own study, (and so did the first Authors of this
book,) which doubtless they would never have done if necessitye of the thing
had not driven them to it. Most necessary therefore it is for all manner of
persons (that do employe any part of their study to the holy scriptures) to
have either this or the like table or concordaunce to help their memory with
all. Purposly therefore to profit all manner of persons I have set forth this
little work, commytting it to your gracys tuysyon, wyshynge that all men
might be profited thereby and no mann offended. The spirit of the lyueyng God
be all ways your gracys comforther and guide in all your doingis to the glory
of God and your sowls health. So be it.

Your Graeces humble and bounden daily Orator. Gwalter Lynne

Dearly beloved brethren in Christ Jesus, to the intent that every man may so
much the fru^fuller use and occupye this register or table it is to be noted
for an introduccion and good understanding, that it serves principally for
three manner of poinctes First it shows the histories of the old and new
Testament, which are soon found, having a respect and regard to the proper
names which in the histories and acts, which are sought for, chefelye do
occur. As if thou desire to know, where and in what place of the scripture
is written ye hystory of innocent Abell, of the righteous Abraham, and of the
obedient Isaac, or of the fervent Helias, then se^ the same name every one by
his lettre, and when thou have found him, thou shall find there a true
introduction to the forsayde history, how be it there is to be noted, that
the proper names are not every where written after one sort, but that they have
some difference, for some of them are written in some places with an.H. and in
some places without an.H. as Habel or Abel, Elias or Helias Ebron or Hebron,
Jericho or Hiericho, And some are in one place written with a.C. as Cain,
Cades, Caath, and in an other place with a.K. as Kain, Kades, Caath. Some also
are written in one place with an.S. as Sacharias, Sidekia, Sidon, Sorobabell,
and in an other place with an.Z. as Zacharias, Zidechias, Zidon Zorobabel.
Therefore gentill reader if any of such like words in the searchyng out of any
history do occure, and thy mind be not satisfied in one place, or lettre, let
it not be tedious unto the, to resort to the other lettre, as it is before
mentioned.

Secondely does this Register also show almoost every persons, certain
sayenges and places, whereof it may be gathered, what there dominion office
and honor and deutie or behaueoure is, what she also inespeciall ought to
endeavor her self to do and to leave undone toward them, with whom she
has ought to do because of her office or of her estate. Besides this certain
examples of such as have behaved the^ selves well or evil, in such their
offices, as namely, what they ought, and are bound to do to there subjects,
how the Bishops ought to behave them selves toward the church. Fathers and
mothers toward their children, and how yuell or well some have ordered them
selves, in the premysses.

Thyrdely, this register leads also to the sentences and places, which may be
conducyble and profitable for the true understanding and learning of the
chief articles and most common points of the holy scripture (of the which
every faithful Christian for his confessions and Christen names sake ought to
have some knowledge and understanding) as what is to be known by these words
God, Christ, men, law, sin, etc. And all these things have we ^eyned in
such wise, that thou art not only brought and led to the chapter, but also
to the letters, which are set ought besides every chapter in the margent, to
the intent that by the means thereof, thou myghtest be eased of much labor and
should not need for one point only to read over the whole chapiters from
the beginning to the place which thou haste taken in hand, and where as
sometime the whole chapter from the beginning, or else from a letter, out to
the end, entreats of one matter and serves to one purpose, there have we, for
to eschew prolixitie left out the letters of the same instead whereof we have
put and ordained a * whereby is sygnified that the same chapter entreats of
the same matter out to the end, and thus we commend you to GOD.

Gwalter Lynne to the Reader.
GEntill Reader if that you woll take the pains, as to read over the Epistle
dedycated to me Lady of Somersetts grace, and the Preface of the Authoures
before named, there by shall you comme to the right knoweledge and use of the
reading of this brefe Concordaunce, God give us grace that we may so read
and use it to the honor of his name and to the profit of our brethren and
neighbors and our salvation. Amen.

Dearly beloved brethren and fryendes I pray you heartily make you well
aquaynted with the books of the holy Bybell thorouwe much reading of them so
shall you be much Eased in seeking any thing above named in the Prefaces. ij.

WHen Philopater had understand by thoos that were comen again that Antiochus
had taken from him such holds as he had, he raised all his army as well footmen as horsemen, and taking with him his sister Arsinoe, he ran out even
affare as the countries of Raphia, that were borderynge upon him, where
Antiochus host camped. And one Theodotus, thinking to bring the matter to
pass by craftye trains, when he had taken the strongest men of armies, that
were put unto him by Ptolomeus, in the night he gat him to Ptolomeus tent to
kill him unawares, and so make an end of the battle. But Dositheus called the
son of Drimilius a Jew borne, and afterward forsakyng the Law, and
turned from his fathers ordinances, which was hired for the purpose, put in
his steed in the tente an other poor man, which chaunsed to be slain for him.

people with them cryeng. Alleluya, went away with joy, and as they went killed
every one of the nation that was naught for example to other and in deed that
day, they killed above three hundredth men, and were very ioyyuos as they
killed them. But thoos that stacke to God to death, having the full fruet of
there health, they went out of the city crowned with very sweet flowers of
all sorts with cryeng and gladness, giving praise to the holy God of there
fathers ye savior of Israel. and dedicating a pillar of prayer in the place
where they feasted, they went their way safe both by land and by sea fre and
merry. And every man came home to his house by the kings commandment, having
greater power against the enemies with glory and fear, then ever they had
before, nor they were not let from there goods by any man, for all men
received there goods as they were named in the byll of attendure, so that
whosoever had any thing of theers, restored it again, with great fear, the
hye God finishyng the matters, to all there healthes. Praised be God the
delyuerer of Israel world without end. Amen.
